<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>Imperial City's Recycling Program has achieved the highest waste reduction
rate of any recycling program in Nebraska's 93 counties and 535 municipalities
as a result of aggressive public education and economic incentive campaigns.
By reducing solid waste generation by 50% since its inception, the program
has diverted tons of material that otherwise would have been buried in
a landfill, and consequently has helped reduce solid waste pollution and
the risk of groundwater contamination. The program provides city and county
residents a 24-hour-a-day drop off site in the center of the downtown area.
Labor for processing is provided through the City's Sanitation Department,
which is funded by City Resident user fees.</p>

<p>Several years ago, the City of Imperial encountered a dilemma. Confronted
with new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) landfill regulations scheduled
to take effect in 1993, the city was faced with performing expensive modifications
to the Imperial landfill to achieve compliance or to shut the landfill
down. Closing the landfill appeared to be an unattractive option. Doing
so would significantly increase the cost of solid waste disposal since
waste would have to be shipped to neighboring disposal sites.</p>

<p>Some quick math, however, revealed that by enacting an aggressive recycling
policy designed to reduce solid waste, the city could not only afford to
close the landfill, but they could save money doing so. With solid waste
disposal costs projected to run $40 a ton, a recycling program receiving
even moderate compliance would keep solid waste disposal costs within reason.
Additionally, the enactment of a recycling program would give the city
a headstart on a new state law mandating a 50% reduction in solid waste
by 2004.</p>

<p><img src="ir_frk.jpg" hspace=4 border=0 height=161 width=116 align=right>Since
its inception, the recycling program has continued to grow in success for
two reasons. First, the city has engaged in a vigorous public education
campaign, informing residents about higher solid waste disposal costs,
distributing mailings, holding training programs and publishing newspaper
articles explaining the environmental and economic importance of recycling.
Second, the city switched in July 1992 from charging all residents the
same flat fee for solid waste removal to a volume-based pricing schedule
in which a resident's or business's solid waste bill is based on the amount
of solid waste generated. Pick up of recyclables is free, so increased
participation in the recycling program results in lower solid waste bills.
Businesses in which cardboard has historically comprised the bulk of their
solid waste have found their solid waste bills drop dramatically.</p>

<p>In addition to achieving compliance among its residents, the City of
Imperial has been successful in locating markets for the recyclables and
receives calls from manufacturers coast to coast in search of a steady
supply of materials for their products.</p>

Parish Christmas Tree/Marsh Restoration Program</h2>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>The Jefferson Parish Christmas Tree/Marsh Restoration Program was created
in 1991 as an innovative way to address two environmental problems at once.
Not only does the program protect and restore threatened marshland and
wetlands along the Louisiana coast, but it diverts thousands of discarded
Christmas trees that otherwise would wind up in the solid waste stream.
</p>

<p>Every year, due to the effects of erosion, Louisiana has been losing
an astonishing 30 to 50 square miles of wetlands from its coasts -- a number
so large it accounts for 80% of the entire nation's wetland losses. This
staggering loss has had serious environmental consequences. The buffer
zone that protects inland urban areas from storm surges has been reduced
and effective filtration of urban runoff has been diminished. Most important
to a state that relies heavily on its fishing industry, the &quot;nursery
grounds&quot; for many commercially harvested species, such as shrimp and
crabs, have been threatened.</p>

<p>Through the program, volunteers in cooperation with environmental organizations,
corporation and local, state and federal agencies are helping to stop the
erosion and to actually rebuild the marshes through the strategic placement
of discarded Christmas trees in shoreline fences and dead-end canals. Bundles
of trees placed in the marshes enable sediment to collect, restoring shorelines
and the trees serve as natural lattices upon which the constituents of
a floating marsh can become established. </p>

<p>In addition to helping restore the area's wetlands and marshes, the
program has served to educate local area residents about the value of Louisiana's
wetlands. Recently, residents voted to establish a statewide tax to create
a Wetlands Trust Fund that will work to restore coastal Louisiana.</p>

<p>The project relies heavily on strong corporate sponsorship and a huge
volunteer effort. Because it gives people a real &quot;hands on&quot; experience
in environmental protection, the program has gained popularity and participation
in the project has become part of the holiday season for many New Orleans
area residents and businesses. Typically, 300 - 500 volunteers will show
up to work weekends bundling trees for placement in the marsh. So popular
is the program that one year sugarcane farmers from neighboring parishes
transported trees to Jefferson using trucks that had been idled by the
end of the growing season.</p>

<center><p><img src="mrule.gif" alt=" " border=0 height=5 width=640></p></center>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>More than 350,000 trees have been placed in shoreline cribs and dead-end
canals, diverting these trees from the solid waste stream and helping to
create marshland.</li>

<li>Trees placed in cribs are positioned 100 feet from the shoreline, where
they trap sediment. The sediment then falls out behind the cribs and collects,
helping to build up eroded shorelines. </li>

<li>In 1993, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency funded a project
to establish floating marshes in abandoned canals that had at one time
provided access to oil and gas exploration activities. Using barges and
tugboats provided by Texaco and Exxon, more than 130,000 trees were collected
and tied in bundles of 50-60 trees apiece by volunteers and then transported
to the canals. The trees provide a loose, organic lattice upon which constituents
of a floating marsh can become established.</li>

<li>Both placement of trees in shoreline cribs and in abandoned dead-end
canals continues today.</li>

<li>The National Guard provides helicopters that airlift the trees for
placement in the marshes.</li>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>The Lake Tahoe Regional Plan, administered by the Tahoe Regional Planning
Agency, works to protect the environment of the Lake Tahoe region by regulating
numerous development issues, including land use, development density, rate
of urban growth, percentage of land coverage, excavation activities and
the impact of development on scenic views.</p>

<p>Created in 1969 as part of the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact adopted
by both the California and Nevada legislatures, the Tahoe Regional Planning
Agency (TRPA) was assigned the task of developing a regional plan that
would reverse the deterioration of the waters of Lake Tahoe and other resources
in order to protect the natural beauty and economic productivity of the
region. In developing the plan, the TRPA was instructed to establish environmental
threshold carrying capacities for water quality, air quality, soil conservation,
wildlife habitat, fish habitat, vegetation, noise, recreation and scenic
resources.</p>

<p>The regional plan contains a transportation/air quality plan designed
to maintain the region's excellent air quality and to reduce dependence
on the automobile. Public transit is viewed as a way to further improve
air and water quality to and to reduce traffic congestion. The plan also
addresses the need to repair existing environmental damage. Finally, the
regional plan includes a comprehensive monitoring program, in which the
results of the ongoing program are compiled and evaluated every five years.</p>

<p>While TRPA&nbsp;sees itself as primarily an environmental agency, it
recognizes the interdependence of environmental, economic and social well-being
of the region. Over time, environmental groups, property rights advocates,
business interests and numerous government agencies involved at Lake Tahoe
have come to recognize that the region's economic vitality is dependent
upon a healthy environment.</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>The Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture, established by the Iowa
Legislature in 1987 as part of the Iowa Groundwater Protection Act, develops
sustainable agricultural systems through sound research and shares the
results of this research with Iowa farmers.</p>

<p>While conventional U.S. farming practices produce an abundant, healthy
and affordable food supply, they also contribute to serious soil erosion
and water contamination, neither of which is sustainable over the long
term. Through its competitive grants and interdisciplinary research teams,
the Center is working to lessen the negative environmental consequences
of farming while maintaining high productivity. Since its creation, the
Center has been successful in helping develop profitable farming systems,
in strengthening rural communities and in conserving soil and groundwater.
The Center achieves its goals through its support of cutting-edge independent
research on the environmental impacts of agricultural chemicals, the use
of alternative crops, biological pest control, and socioeconomic evaluation
of farming systems. </p>

<p>The Center conducts research in two ways. Its competitive grantmaking
program awards grants to academic institutions engaged in agricultural
research, and the Center's own Issues Teams facilitate research by linking
institutions, colleges, universities and departments within academic institutions
in the pursuit of a solution to a particular problem. This multidisciplinary
approach includes economic analysis, ensuring solutions that are both profitable
and adaptable by farmers.</p>

<p>The Center has effectively demonstrated that it is possible to maintain
crop yields and to control plant diseases, predators and weeds without
damaging the land, water and wildlife. For instance, production methods
that break pest cycles, such as crop rotations, can reduce the need for
pesticides. Using natural sources for crop nutrients and targeting the
application of herbicides are safe and affordable options to current chemical-intensive
practices. The use of hilly terrain as a rotationally-grazed pasture provides
an alternative to conventional, erosion-prone monoculture. Center research
has even demonstrated that smaller, more diverse farming operations can
actually be more profitable than a larger, mono-cropped farm.</p>

<p>The Center believes that voluntary compliance with resource-conserving
practices is preferable to government regulation, and sound science is
the best way to support development of those practices.</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Competitive Grants</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Through competitive grants, the Center supports research and demonstration
in sustainable agriculture systems.</li>

<li>In its first three years, the Center provided $2.3 million in 55 competitive
grants at 11 institutions and nonprofit organizations throughout Iowa.</li>

<li>Through June 1994, the Center has invested in 114 competitive grant
projects. An average of 40 grant projects are active in any given year.</li>

<li>The Center has funded research in areas such as:</li>

<ul>
<li>Developing tree buffer strips along waterways.</li>

<li>Rotating spring oats and soybean crops to reduce erosion.</li>

<li>Using predictive models to reduce fungicide sprays on tomatoes.</li>

<li>Native plant use.</li>

<li>Measuring the effects of pesticides on stream organisms.</li>

<li>An evaluation of prairie grass's effect on soil quality.</li>

<li>An evaluation of tillage and crop rotation on groundwater quality.</li>

<li>Using animal manure to control soil-borne plant pathogens.</li>

<li>Using entomopathogenic fungus to suppress larval populations of the
European Corn Borer. It is estimated that corn borers cause more than $100
million worth of damage to Iowa corn crops every year.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Interdisciplinary Research Teams</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Seven teams conduct systems-based research in sustainable farming practices.</li>

<li>Long-term studies focus on cropping systems, grazing systems for beef
cattle, alfalfa pest controls, socioeconomic impacts, animal waste management,
agroecosystems, and weed control alternatives.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Education</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The Center supports two educational delivery teams that promote the
public's awareness of environmental stewardship issues. The program's findings
reach farmers, Extension Service personnel, conservationists, nonprofit
organizations, agricultural chemical dealers and applicators, community
colleges, agricultural lenders, and other groups.</li>

<li>The Center holds an annual conference that attracts more than 300 people.</li>

<li>The Center supports field days, farm tours, and smaller conferences
in outlying areas to make its services and information available to people
across the state.</li>

<li>The Center's studies and findings have been incorporated into new sustainable
agriculture curricula in secondary and post-secondary schools throughout
the state.</li>

<li>The Center publishes a quarterly newsletter, research program reports,
annual reports, news releases, facts sheets, conference proceedings and
other special publications.</li>

</dl>

<dl>
<dl>
<dl>
<li>The Center estimates that approximately 25,000 individuals have benefited
from the 90 research and education projects the Center has funded.</li>

<li>Over the past two years, more than 400 programs and presentations have
been conducted and three statewide conferences have been held.</li>

<li>In 1994 alone, the Center conducted research, demonstration and education
programs in more than 60 of Iowa's 99 counties. In its first five years,
the Center has supported work in a total of 80 Iowa counties.</li>

<li>Over the past five years, farmers have reduced their use of nitrogen-containing
fertilizer by 20% without any loss in yield, and reduced the potential
for nitrate to enter the groundwater supply.</li>

<li>Initiatives currently underway in Washington, Minnesota and Wisconsin
are modeled closely after the Leopold Center.</li>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>The Manchester Planning and Zoning Program works to create guidelines
that are consistent with the Town's sustainable development vision: preserving
Manchester's &quot;village&quot; atmosphere; protecting its scenic, historic
and natural beauty; and recognizing that the Town's beauty and abundant
natural resources serve as the economic base for the community.</p>

<p>In November 1994 the Town of Manchester produced &quot;A Community Vision
for Manchester,&quot; which outlines the community's development priorities.
Produced with the input of numerous individuals, agencies and organizations,
this vision outlines a strategy to avoid the urban sprawl, traffic and
congestion that have come to characterize many growing U.S. communities.</p>

<p>&quot;We realize that the commercial and residential growth potential
of Manchester is finite,&quot; offers the Community Vision for Manchester.
&quot;We believe that we should work to shape Manchester's growth toward
an optimum size and density which, while preserving and enhancing our economic
vitality, does not stretch beyond the point where it destroys the very
essence of the qualities of life we cherish.&quot; </p>

<p>To achieve this optimum size, development is strictly limited. When
it is allowed, it is only where both the natural and man-made infrastructure
can support it, thus contributing to efficient land use from a natural
and human point of view. </p>

<p>&quot;From our perspective, responsible governance, growth, and development
must protect and enhance the natural and built environments. Short-term
gains that ignore long-term costs are not tolerated here,&quot; says Lee
A. Krohn, Planning Director. </p>

<p>It is this long-term view that has enabled Manchester to dismiss the
incorrect notion that sound development must strike a balance between the
environment and the economy. Rather, by recognizing that a healthy environment
<i>provides</i> the job base, it becomes clear that it is in everyone's
best interest for development to occur only when such development will
not threaten the environment -- and hence, the job base -- over the long
term.</p>

<p>In writing the planning and zoning regulations, Manchester has developed
diverse partnerships within the community to maximize effectiveness, minimize
conflict and avoid duplication of services. In addition, this diversity
encourages constant review of the Town's planning and zoning approach,
creating a flexible, responsive planning agency.</p>

<p>Manchester's current plan and bylaws specify a strict regulatory approach,
with an emphasis on control and constraint. The Town is now are now working
on changes that will balance that ledger with guidelines that provide encouragement
and incentives to create desired results. The Town hopes that this change
will foster an even more cooperative and positive approach to development
control, while ensuring greater satisfaction of municipal goals. </p>

<p>&quot;What we do know is that planning and zoning are not impediments
to economic progress; rather, they are critical and integral to that progress,&quot;
says Krohn.</p>

<center><p><img src="mrule.gif" alt=" " border=0 height=5 width=640></p></center>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<p>Manchester's planning and zoning plan is based upon Manchester's Community
Vision, which sets out the following priorities:</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Community</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The members of the Manchester community will demonstrate their care
for each other and their visitors through personal actions in support of:
social, cultural, spiritual and recreational services; neighbors in need;
group volunteer efforts; community organizations; diversity of backgrounds
and ideas; economic vitality; and business ethics.</li>

<li>The community will seek to improve the level of education avaialable
to its youth and work force, and will anticipate and prepare for an aging
population by developing facilities, services and programs for the elderly.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Landscape</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>All human development will blend carefully with the topography and
vegetation, preserving greenery, rock formations, and natural and scenic
views.</li>

<li>Tree lines and specified species of shade trees will be planted and
continue to proliferate.</li>

<li>More green space will be created between streets and sidewalks and
between sidewalks and buildings.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Townscape</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The &quot;village&quot; concept in which pastoral lands gradually give
way to residential areas which in turn blend into commercial centers will
be preserved.</li>

<li>Commercial, social and civic activities will be concentrated in the
town core.</li>

<li>The historic qualities of Manchester Village will be preserved.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Streetscape</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Downtown development will be pedestrian-oriented and human in scale.</li>

<li>Prevailing &quot;suburban&quot; development patterns in which buildings
are sited to accommodate the automobile will be discouraged.</li>

<li>Historic buildings and districts will be preserved.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Transportation and Circulation</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>An efficient and safe park-and-walk environment will be maintained.</li>

<li>A network of sidewalks, walkways, and bicycle paths will connect all
parts of town. These pathways will link Town with Village, residential
areas with recreation, commercial, government and essential services.</li>

<li>Automobile-centered development will be discouraged.</li>

<li>Parking areas will be attractive and well-integrated into the walkway
system.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Town Economy</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Recreation, hospitality and arts will be recognize as the basis of
the Manchester economy and as such will be protected and nurtured. In attracting
businesses to the area, the creation and maintenance of jobs whose pay
scale is at a level capable of supporting a family will be a priority.</li>

<li>Partnerships between schools and the business community will be promoted
to develop hospitality and service-excellence training programs, and other
job programs, for all citizens.</li>

<li>Investments in town infrastructure and private services will be made
to permit the attraction of electronic technology-dependent businesses.</li>

<li>The commercial core will remain tightly contained. Additional development
will occur immediately adjacent to the core, marginally &quot;fattening&quot;
it rather than elongating it along a strip.</li>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>The Materials Reuse and Recycling program, part of the Center for Neighborhood
Technology's Campaign for Sustainable Chicago, works to enable Chicago
to shift from waste generation and disposal to policies and strategies
that promote conservation and recycling of materials. </p>

<p>A key component of the Center's Materials Reuse and Recycling program
is to ensure that the environmental and economic benefits of the program
accrue to the local, lower-income communities where recycling facilities
are most likely to appear. The program works to shape federal policy to
expand opportunities at the grass roots level, and it works locally to
demonstrate that materials conservation can be an effective engine of equitable
economic growth. </p>

<p>While the Center has been engaged in broad recycling and reuse initiatives
for quite a while, during the past two years the Center has refocused its
recycling efforts on industrial recycling and has done so within the context
of a &quot;materials conservation&quot; ethic. The program works to capture
the numerous environmental benefits that stem from dramatically increasing
the proportion of reprocessed materials serving as the &quot;raw&quot;
inputs to Chicago's factories: decreased energy use, decreased landfill
use (with resulting protection of groundwater), and the realization of
indirect protection of wilderness areas that otherwise would have been
damaged by extractive industries.</p>

<p>In addition to the environmental benefits, the Center works to demonstrate
that recycling offers economic advantages as well. Recycling creates more
jobs than conventional waste disposal methods. Reuse and recycling operations
are often labor-intensive and can be a source of entry- and skilled-level
positions. Additional jobs can be created locally by attracting industries
that will turn recovered materials into finished products. Essentially,
recycling is economic development. By capturing the value of material that
was once thrown away, recycling can cycle money and jobs back into any
community creating neighborhood wealth and opportunity, even in the poorest
communities.</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Alliance for a Sustainable Materials Economy</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The Center co-convened and chairs this alliance of recycling and environmental
organizations that is seeking to promote materials conservation as an engine
of economic growth to the Federal government. </li>

<li>The Alliance is pushing for the abolition of tax and other preferences
for the extraction of raw materials to make recycling and reuse industries
more competitive.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Industry/Community Collaboration</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>The Minnesota Sustainable Development Initiative has brought together
105 citizen-leaders representing local agencies and environmental, business
and civic organizations to develop a sustainable development plan for Minnesota
that would reconcile the economic and environmental goals of the state,
ensuring environmental protection while allowing for economic and job growth.</p>

<p>The group was convened in 1993 by Minnesota's Governor and the Minnesota
Environmental Quality Board.</p>

<p>After convening for more than a year, the Initiative produced its final
report, <i>Redefining Progress: Working Toward a Sustainable Future</i>,
containing more than 400 specific strategies for protecting the environment
and developing the economy in the areas of agriculture, energy, forestry,
manufacturing, minerals, recreation and settlement. </p>

<p>The Initiative's recommendations, presented to a &quot;sustainability
congress&quot; convened in February 1994, calls for fundamental changes
in education and research priorities, and for tax, regulatory and investment
policies to encourage and reward sustainable behavior.</p>

<p>One of the key's to the Initiative's success in enabling 105 individuals
with different backgrounds, goals and concerns to build a consensus is
ensuring that representatives from all facets of the community were represented
within the initiative. Asking traditional adversaries to gather around
the same table and create a shared vision helped establish common ground
and helped all parties understand how interdependent the goals of conservation,
economic progress and human development are.</p>

<p>In the writing their Vision, the Initiative concluded that &quot;Minnesotans
maintain their quality of life through sustainable use of energy and natural
resources, recognizing that population growth, resource consumption and
lifestyle choices determine the options they leave for future generations.&quot;</p>

<center><p><img src="mrule.gif" alt=" " border=0 height=5 width=640></p></center>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Initiative Outline</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The 105 citizens were divided into seven 15-member teams to develop
a 50-year vision, a set of guiding principles, and specific strategies
for protecting the environment and developing the economy in the areas
of agriculture, energy, forestry, manufacturing, minerals, recreation and
settlement. Each group was assigned to address one of the seven areas for
investigation.</li>

<li>The guiding principle in developing this initiative was to adhere to
the definition of sustainability as established by the Brundtland Commission:
sustainable development is development &quot;meeting the needs of the present
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own
needs.&quot;</li>

<li>The Environmental Quality Board presented &quot;Redefining Progress&quot;
to a statewide &quot;congress&quot; on sustainable development in February
1994. More than 400 citizens from across the state gave feedback and helped
accelerate the work of building consensus for change as evidenced by the
initiatives adopted in the Legislature.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Initiative Goals</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The goals of the Initiative are to:</li>

<ul>
<li>Protect and improve the state's environment and its natural resource
base.</li>

<li>Increase the number and quality of Minnesota's jobs.</li>

<li>Foster communities that are socially, economically and environmentally
sustainable.</li>

<li>Build routine consideration of future generations into the decisions
we make as citizens and consumers in our communities, businesses and government.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Initiative's Specific Recommendations</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Move the state and nation toward markets and government actions that
fully account for the environmental and social costs of decisions.</li>

<li>Inventory the state's natural resource base.</li>

<li>Chart environmental quality trends within the state.</li>

<li>Integrate resource management by all levels of government in a watershed-
and ecosystem-based framework.</li>

<li>Use the tax system to help Minnesota business improve efficiency and
increase innovation by providing tax incentives for reducing resource use
and pollution (e.g., reducing taxes on activities that should be encouraged,
like capital investment).</li>

<li>Ask communities to prepare to meet the needs of minorities and those
with limited incomes (e.g., create financial incentives to promote affordable
housing and inner city redevelopment).</li>

<li>Ease &quot;heavy&quot; environmental regulation and general business
taxes in favor of increased fees targeted to waste generation on an escalating
scale.</li>

<li>Provide &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; for environmental permits.</li>

<li>Enable faster permit approval for applicants who have shown good prior
performance.</li>

<li>Reduce taxes on capital investments designed to improve pollution prevention.</li>

<li>Place greater emphasis on the true costs of products throughout their
life-cycle by examining how many resources are consumed from initial product
to final disposal (i.e., &quot;cradle to grave&quot; analysis).</li>

<li>Establish the most scientifically sound health and environmental regulations,
while giving businesses flexibility to meet those standards.</li>

<li>Develop educational, regulatory and incentive-based approaches.</li>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>The Montgomery County Conservation Corps (MCCC) helps to turn around
the lives of out-of-school and unemployed 17 to 23 year-old youth by putting
them to work on local conservation, construction and beautification projects.
As a consequence, participating Corpsmembers receive on-the-job training,
and they also receive life-skills and environmental education through courses
provided during the program.</p>

<p>Typically, a Corps member is referred by the juvenile/adult justice
system, the Department of Social Services, or other health and human service
agencies in the area. Once referred, potential Corpsmembers can choose
to enroll and receive $4.50 an hour to complete three, 12-week &quot;crew&quot;
rotations during which they participate in construction projects in the
areas of carpentry, landscaping and conservation. Corpsmembers also participate
in career workshops, life skills workshops (e.g., money management and
nutrition), individual and group counseling and environmental education.
Corpsmembers who have not graduated high school are required to study and
sit for the GED&nbsp;(General Equivalency Diploma) exam.</p>

<p>Each year, Corpsmembers build trails, homeless shelters, bridges, handicapped
access ramps and playgrounds. They renovate log cabins, clear streams,
run a recycling program, landscape parks and public buildings, plant thousands
of trees and clean up tons of trash. One year Corpsmembers constructed
1,000 linear feet of shelving at the Wheaton Regional Library and saved
the community thousands of dollars in contractor cost avoidance.</p>

<p>Neal Potter, a former County Councilman, established the Corps in 1984
as a unique way to help the environment and to provide an opportunity for
the disadvantaged. &quot;I remember so well the conservation corps of the
30's that helped millions of people get out of the Depression.&quot; says
Potter.</p>

<p><img src="mc_crnk.jpg" hspace=5 border=0 height=100 width=126 align=left>The
Corps, however, is not for everybody. The work is hard and the pay is low.
As the brochure warns, &quot;It's outdoors and it's physical. ... You may
work in rain, snow, and intense heat.&quot; But the program promises substantial
benefits, as well. &quot;The rewards are great and can't be measured in
monetary terms. You will have the opportunity to work and learn with others
your age and your experience in MCCC will help you gain future employment.
You will serve others and make a difference in your community.&quot;</p>

<p>Shanna Strahan is proud of her involvement with the Corps. Abandoned
by her mother at 14, Shanna took to the streets to survive. When she enrolled
in the Corps, she was finally given a productive channel for her energy,
and she has excelled. Recently promoted to Supervisor's Aid, Shanna says,
&quot;I can't turn back the clock, but I can try to help others avoid the
mistakes that I've made.&quot;</p>

<center><p><img src="mrule.gif" alt=" " border=0 height=5 width=640></p></center>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>How it Works:</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The MCCC annually enrolls about 36 young adults, most of whom have
serious barriers to career employment and community responsibility. Additionally,
the majority of these individuals have no conservation awareness or employable
environmental skills. Corpsmembers who stay for more than 3 to 6 months
undergo a dramatic transformation in their appreciation for the environment
as well as in the acquisition of basic environmental skills.</li>

<li>Corpsmembers enroll for one year and are paid $4.50 an hour. Each Corpsmember
is expected to complete three, 12-week crew rotations consisting of carpentry,
landscaping and conservation skills. Advanced members move up to the Silver
Spring crew for an additional twelve weeks.</li>

<li>Corpsmembers who have not graduated high school receive GED&nbsp;training.</li>

<li>All Corpsmembers participate in career workshops, life skills workshops
(e.g., money management and nutrition), individual and group counseling,
and environmental education. The environmental education curriculum comprises
instruction on:</li>

<ul>
<li>Ecosystems</li>

<li>Watersheds</li>

<li>Streams</li>

<li>Wetlands</li>

<li>The Chesapeake Bay</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li><b><font SIZE=+1>Sample Construction Projects</font></b></li>

<ul>
<li>Corpsmember Crews have restored locks on the C&amp;O&nbsp;Canal, repaired
historically significant log cabins, built nature trails in parklands and
stocked state-owned streams with trout.</li>

<li>A crew of eight corps members is deployed in the local Silver Spring
urban district to participate in crime prevention activities and revitalization
of the business district.</li>

<li>Crews engage in beautification and repair of the local Housing Opportunities
Commission (HOC) housing development. Members of these crews all reside
in HOC housing.</li>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>The Multifamily Energy Savings Program is a project of the City of Portland's
Energy Office that provides comprehensive assistance to multifamily property
owners and managers to improve the resource efficiency of their properties.</p>

<p>The program acts as a broker to connect property owners with resource
efficiency programs and incentives offered by the city's businesses and
agencies, such as those offered by the local electric and gas utilities,
the city's solid waste and water bureaus and the Oregon Department of Energy.
As such, the program serves as a &quot;one-stop shop&quot; for owners to
maximize existing incentives available to multifamily properties.</p>

<p>Owners are encouraged to incorporate several efficiency measures simultaneously.
For example, many owners enter the program to upgrade their windows and
are then encouraged to adopt a &quot;whole house&quot; approach and install
insulation, efficient lighting fixtures, water conservation measures and
recycling containers.</p>

<p>In addition to its partnerships with local utilities, the program has
teamed up with apartment owner trade associations, property management
companies and local weatherization contractors, enabling the program to
leverage resources for trade shows, direct mail campaigns, special projects
and newsletters.</p>

<p>As a result of the program, Portland area apartment residents have more
comfortable homes and lower utility bills, housing costs have been reduced,
property values raised and neighborhoods made more livable. In part, the
success of the program is due to the program's focus on demonstrating the
property owners and managers that efficiency investments not only make
sense for the environment, but they make sense for the bottom line.</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>The Orange Grove Recycling Center, operated by the Orange Grove Center,
is a recently expanded $2 million materials recovery facility that employs
100 adults with developmental disabilities to process more than 55 tons
of recyclables per day for the City of Chattanooga.</p>

<p>The expansion of the recycling facility, which resulted in increased
job opportunities for developmentally disabled Chattanooga residents, was
coordinated with the City's efforts to expand its recycling program.</p>

<p>A few years ago, the City of Chattanooga was looking at a whopping price
tag of $150,000 an acre for municipal solid waste disposal. With such disposal
projected to cost the city $23 million over five years, the notion of saving
landfill space by expanding a pilot curbside recycling program into a permanent,
citywide program became more attractive. &quot;One-fourth of everything
going into the landfill could be cut out by recycling,&quot; said Councilman
Davey Crockett. &quot;All of us old dogs are going to have to learn some
new tricks.&quot;</p>

<p><img src="og_sort.jpg" hspace=3 border=0 height=121 width=128 align=right>The
Orange Grove Center, a community agency that offers educational, vocational
and residential services to more than 700 persons with developmental disabilities,
began expansion of its facility to accommodate the additional flow of recyclable
goods while providing opportunities for its clients to contribute to the
process. Rather than fully automating the facility, then, it was designed
to optimize local labor.</p>

<p>On August 5, 1994, the new facility shipped its first truckload of baled
newsprint to Bowater Incorporated Southern Division, the nation's largest
manufacturer of newsprint with recycled content.</p>

<p>The construction of this recycling facility in Chattanooga has proven
beneficial to all: the city has diverted large amounts of usable materials
from the local landfill reducing air, soil and groundwater pollution; local
residents have become involved in an essential environmental activity;
quality processed materials are being provided for reuse; and -- consistent
with the Orange Grove Center's operating philosophy -- a special population
of residents have been given the opportunity to reach for and achieve their
greatest potential.</p>

<center><p><img src="mrule.gif" alt=" " border=0 height=5 width=640></p></center>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>An extensive period of planning and assessment preceded expansion of
the facility.</li>

<li>The city launched an educational program on the benefits of recycling
prior to implementing the city-wide program. In areas where volunteers
visited residents to discuss the benefits of recycling, a 50% increase
in materials left at the curbside for recycling was realized.</li>

<li>Orange Grove staff estimate the citywide recycling program is diverting
more than 4,000 tons of recyclables per month from the landfill.</li>

<li>The Orange Grove Recycling Center processes more than 50 tons of recyclables
per day.</li>

<li>An education area within the Recycling Center is being developed and
will be the site of tours, meetings, fields trips, etc.</li>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>The Oregon Resource Efficient Communities (OREC) program is a state-sponsored,
community-based effort to improve the resource and energy efficiency of
local businesses, schools and government through program and management
analyses and energy audits. Businesses participating in the program can
expect to save energy, conserve water, reduce solid wastes and increase
recycling rates, thereby saving money and increasing productivity.</p>

<p>While garbage, water and energy prices in the Northwest have long been
among the lowest in the nation, dwindling natural resources and rising
environmental costs mean that Oregon businesses and public agencies must
be energy-conscious to be competitive. The OREC program was developed to
anticipate this change and to help to secure a healthy economy and healthy
environment for Oregon's future.</p>

<p>The River City Resource Group (RCRG), a resource efficiency consultant
under contract with the State, has been hired to perform comprehensive
resource efficiency audits on participating businesses and to identify
resource efficiency opportunities and goals. The Departments of Energy
and Environmental Quality staff will then recommend specific measures to
achieve these goals, and will estimate the costs and projected savings
of such measures. Sample measures include capital improvements such as
lighting retrofits and operation modifications such as waste prevention.</p>

<p>Participation in the program is voluntary. Similar efforts in other
states have shown that a community-wide approach to resource efficiency
is more successful than business-by-business control and regulation. The
project began in 1994 in Corvallis and will remain a pilot project there
until 1997. At that time, it is expected that the program will be expanded
to five more Oregon communities.</p>

<p>The program offers direct savings in energy, water and waste disposal
costs. The program also provides participants with a competitive edge,
as they reduce costs and receive productivity gains through process improvements.
The knowledge shared promotes long-term economic sustainability and will
attract new businesses to Oregon.</p>

<p>&quot;This is one of those win-win situations,&quot; says Jeff Demetrescu,
executive director of the Corvallis Area Chamber of Commerce. &quot;It's
good for business, and it's good for the environment.&quot;</p>

<li>Nine Corvallis organizations have volunteered to participate in the
program, including a produce grower and processor, an insurance agency,
a credit union, a hardware store, the school district, the public works
department, a construction company and a fiberboard manufacturer.</li>

<li>Each participant has agreed to implement at least three of the recommended
modifications.</li>

<li>It is hoped that participants will communicate with each other and
help businesses enroll in the program and implement efficiency efforts.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Program Details</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Recommended capital improvements have included installing fluorescent
lighting, purchasing recycling containers and installing energy management
systems.</li>

<li>Recommended changes in operations and management practices have included
turning off lights, setting back thermostats, revising packaging and recycling.</li>

<li>The Corvallis Chamber of Commerce has agreed to support a resource
conservation manager (RCM), who will establish an energy accounting system,
identify efficiency opportunities, implement conservation measures and
track savings. It is expected that energy savings will pay the cost of
the RCM.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Financing</font></b></p>

nearly universal participation from customers in a variety of its initiatives
including the placement of insulating blankets around hot water heaters
and the installation of load management devices on air conditioners.</p>

<p>Wes Birdsall, then general manager of OMU, started the demand-side management
program in response both to rising oil prices in 1973 and growing demands
for energy. To keep rates down and avoid building additional generating
capacity -- which meant a costly, polluting, coal-burning power plant --
Birdsall decided to see if Osage could become more efficient with the energy
already available. If so, a winning situation for all parties would be
at hand: customers would enjoy lower rates, OMU&nbsp;would avoid costly
infrastructural development expenses, pollution would be reduced, and money
saved by homeowners and businesses could be kept in the local economy.</p>

<p>As one of his first steps, Birdsall climbed into a plane and took aerial
infrared photographs of the town, circled the dark spots indicating heat
loss, and visited the owners of those sites. It wasn't hard to convince
customers that investments in energy efficiency, such as insulation and
weather stripping, were in order.</p>

<p>&quot;One of the most effective things we did was to take an infrared
scanner into many local buildings,&quot; says Birdsall. &quot;When we showed
people on the scanner how much energy they were losing, they usually were
on the phone to a contractor before we could get out the door.&quot;</p>

<p>Since then the program has expanded and includes air conditioner and
furnace tune-up rebates, compact fluorescent lighting rebates, free appliance
testing, free low-flow water fixtures and free energy audits. The program
now saves Osage residents more than $1.2 million a year in energy costs,
giving Osage's 3,800 residents an economic boost in the arm.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't see any difference between a dollar brought in by a new
business and a dollar that's saved due to energy conservation,&quot; says
Birdsall.</p>

<p>Although Osage and other communities can still do even more -- the Japanese
and Germans use energy twice as efficiently as we do -- Osage's ground
breaking efforts as detailed on the PBS program, <i>Race to Save the Planet</i>,
have earned it the title, &quot;the energy conservation capital of America.&quot;</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Economic Benefits</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Economists for the state of Nebraska estimate that 80% of every dollar
spent on energy bills leaves the state economy without generating further
economic activity.</li>

<li>Energy conservation has an economic multiplier of $2.32, meaning that
every $1.00 spent conserving energy generates $2.32 in local economic activity.
The economic multipliers associated with <i>consuming</i>, rather than
<i>conserving</i>, energy are far lower. Natural gas purchases have an
economic multiplier of $1.48 while purchases of electricity have a multiplier
of $1.75.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Participant Examples</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Fox River Mills, a medium-sized textile manufacturer that produces
socks for the sporting goods industry, has reduced the energy costs of
producing a pair of socks by 29%. The factory produces 10 million pairs
of socks a year and the savings add up to $150,000 annually. The plant,
which employed 110 workers in 1984, employs more than 300 today.</li>

<li>Steele's Super Value store put all their refrigerator compressors in
one room, insulated it, and piped the waste heat into the store for heating
during the winter. The store saves about $600 a month, enough to lower
prices by 5% and to keep people from driving into town to buy from the
larger competitors.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Program Details</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>All street lighting has been changed to high pressure sodium fixtures,
which have paid for themselves in 4 and 1/2 years.</li>

<li>Hundreds of deciduous trees have been planted as part of a long-term
project to cut future air conditioning costs.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Demand-Side Management Program offers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Free use of electric test meters to locate inefficient appliances.</li>

<li>Infrared scans of all businesses and homes.</li>

<li>Scans of the electrical system to identify line loss.</li>

<li>A load management program that cuts electric peak loads by up to 10%.</li>

<li>A home weatherization program for low-income customers.</li>

<li>Free compact fluorescent bulb giveaways and rebates.</li>

<li>Low-cost leasing of a hydraulically-operated tree planter to replace
dead elm trees, saving up to 50% on air conditioning bills. Trees are donated
by Osage Nursery.</li>

<li>Complete energy audits with interest buy downs for efficiency projects.</li>

<li>Efficiency training in elementary and secondary schools allowing students
to take ideas home.</li>

</dl>
</dl>

<dl>
<dl>
<dl>
<li>Osage saves more than $1.2 million a year in energy costs.</li>

<li>The average homeowner saves almost $200 a year in energy bills; the
average business saves even more.</li>

<p><b><i>Compliance</i></b></p>

<dl>
<li>Ninety-six percent of users have had load management devices installed
on their central air conditioners, 100% have received insulating jackets
for their water heaters, and 950 compact fluorescent light bulbs are in
use.</li>
</dl>

<p><b><i>Efficiency Measures</i></b></p>

<dl>
<li>Instead of having to add generating capability as projected in 1984,
Osage has been able to delay it until 2000.</li>

<li>Since 1974, Osage has reduced its natural gas consumption by 45% and
reduced its annual growth in electricity demand from 6% to 3%.</li>

<li>Osage Municipal Utilities has been able reduce electricity rates by
19% during the last eight years and natural gas rates by 5% during the
last five years.</li>

<li>Infrared scans reveal that 85% - 90% of all homes are now well insulated.</li>
</dl>

<p><b>Environmental Benefits</b></p>

<dl>
<li>Over their lifetime, the 950 compact fluorescent bulbs in use will
prevent the burning of nearly 200 tons of coal. </li>

<li>Every year the compact fluorescent bulbs will reduce annual pollution
by nearly 1,000 tons of carbon dioxide and 13 tons of sulphur dioxide.</li>
</dl>

<p><b>Program Replication</b></p>

<dl>
<li>Numerous utilities across the United States and world have asked for
information regarding the OMU program, including the Electricity Supply
Association of New Zealand and the Swedish Power Board. The program has
been replicated by 36 other Iowa utilities.</li>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>The Owsley County Action Team (OCAT) is a group of citizens representing
a broad cross-section of the community who are working toward implementing
an economic diversification strategy that promotes entrepreneurial initiatives
in high-value agriculture, wood and forest-based enterprises, tourism and
recreation, industrial development and infrastructure development. </p>

<p>Since its formation in 1847, Owsley County has been hampered by poverty
and unemployment. The county's economic base is composed solely of timber
and agriculture, making it extraordinarily susceptible to economic downturns.
As the sixth poorest county in the nation, real unemployment hovers at
about 47% while the county's farms, one of its primary sources of income,
have been disappearing. Efforts to reverse the county's fortunes have been
hampered by its inaccessibility to primary transportation systems, and
its lack of other natural resources.</p>

<p>In 1992 a group of citizens, with guidance from the U.S. Forest Service,
convened to address these problems. The group was formalized soon after
as the Owsley County Action Team with a start up grant from the Forest
Service. Based on the input of dozens of community members, OCAT obtained
broad community support for an economic diversification study and became
the forum for planning and sharing ideas.</p>

<p>The resulting diversification plan calls for development of the local
economy through agriculture, forestry and tourism while protecting the
county's natural resources by ensuring sustainable resource utilization
and stewardship practices.</p>

<p>OCAT members represent a broad socioeconomic cross section of the county,
ensuring that numerous viewpoints are represented. One member organization,
Workers of Rural Kentucky (WORK), comprises mainly low-income women who
have joined together to share information and expertise, and have successfully
started three small businesses.</p>

<p>Owsley Cando, another OCAT&nbsp;member, has established a recycling
center and sponsors environmental education programs in the schools.</p>

<p>Successful collaboration among the stakeholders has resulted in productive
spin-off groups and partnerships with area universities and development
agencies.</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>The Pine Street Co-Housing project has brought together a group of resident-developers
to design and build a small, eight-home intergenerational community that
emphasizes resource efficiency, environmental preservation and a deep sense
of community.</p>

<p>Located on a 5.3-acre parcel near Amherst, Massachusetts, the project
consists of eight small homes, built as duplexes, in a configuration that
maximizes open land and concentrates living quarters near community areas.
The size, shape, orientation and construction of the homes emphasize energy
and resource efficiency while the community design favors pedestrians over
automobiles.</p>

<p>The brainchild of architect Bruce Coldham, the Pine Street Co-Housing
development group was formed as a way to combat conventional urban sprawl.
&quot;My wife, Mary Sayer, and I were living here with just our two daughters,&quot;
says Coldham. &quot;We owned the house out by the road, the same place
we live now, and we also owned the barn. There were three vacant lots next
to our lot. We realized that if we didn't do something, pretty soon we'd
be looking at three new driveways and three big suburban houses. We thought
we could improve on that.&quot;</p>

<p>Starting in the summer of 1990, Coldham brought together as many as
200 people to participate in a community planning process, during which
participants met three weekends per month for five years to define the
project, master the development process, and determine who, ultimately,
would become resident-developers within the community. Over time, individuals
relinquished options until the target of eight committed households was
achieved.</p>

<p>The vision of the group was to create a mutually supportive community
in which the incessant demands on child rearing, meal preparation, gardening
and building maintenance could be ameliorated by collaboration between
parents and neighbors. Rather than each house functioning as an autonomous
unit, the community would operate interdependently: cooking chores would
rotate, meals would be eaten together, maintenance projects would be shared,
a community garden would flourish.</p>

<p>To realize this vision, the boundaries of the subdivided set of four
contiguous parcels were reconfigured to cluster the lots, thereby retaining
the bulk of the site as open land, and the homes were built as duplexes,
with each pair of homes connected by a shared entrance. </p>

<p>The project has been an unqualified success. While people often feel
isolated in conventional housing, the automobile having severed the links
between neighbors, Pine Street neighbors know each other, they work together,
and they support each other.</p>

<p>&quot;Different people do different things,&quot; says Coldham. &quot;One
guy isn't very outdoorsy, but he's fabulous with numbers. He's an expert
on black holes who teaches at UMass. He keeps track of the accounting with
a fastidiousness you'd find only in an astrophysicist. Two other guys love
to mow the lawn. Another resident, the chief oboist in the Springfield
Symphony, likes to operate the snow blower. Another is an entomologist
who's taken to the orchard.&quot;</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Planning and Construction</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>During the planning process the participants developed a Development
Timeline Game, which models the development process using colored activity
cards on a long table.</li>

<li>Decisions were made by consensus, which required more upfront discussion
and deliberation, but ultimately produced better actions and shortened
implementation time. The respect for the group process has persisted to
instruct the shared living and community management routines.</li>

<li>Houses are much smaller than is typical -- they range from 800 to 1,200
square feet -- but residents also have access to a common house that provides
additional living area and community interaction.</li>

<li>Pitched roofs increase spaciousness on the second floor.</li>

<li>The basements are constructed to provide a livable environment.</li>

<li>The houses are attached in pairs and share a common entry. This space
isolates the houses acoustically and provides an energy-efficient entry
to each one.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Resource and Energy Efficiency</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The project retained 3.5 of the 5.2 acres as open arable land, which
can be farmed organically without pesticides, herbicides or industrial
fertilizers.</li>

<li>Dependence on automobiles has been reduced by carpooling, and by providing
many business necessities in the common house, including printers, a copier
and fax machine.</li>

<li>More than 90% of construction waste disposal was directed away from
landfills to useful ends.</li>

<li>The clustered design diminished paving, draining structures and utility
trenching.</li>

<li>Space heating and cooling&nbsp;are provided using geothermal heat pumps.</li>

<li>The buildings use cellulose insulation blown into the roof wall and
cavities.</li>

<li>The buildings are located on land that is elevated above remaining
open land. Future ponds have been mapped out and a system for directing
rainwater runoff to the ponds has been designed.</li>

<li>Roofs are sized, oriented and inclined so that photovoltaic arrays
can be added in the future to help supply the houses with their electrical
needs.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Community Endeavors</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Residents assisted other residents with unsecured, intramural loans
that enabled them to secure fixed rate mortgages at more attractive rates.</li>

<li>The group is renovating the lower portion of the existing barn to become
a permanent community kitchen and dining room.</li>

The annual budget for the Pine Street Co-Housing project is very small
since the residents are an extremely collaborative group that provides
all routine maintenance themselves (i.e., mowing the lawns, caring for
the orchards and community gardens, shoveling the snow and performing building
maintenance). Accordingly, the annual budget for operating the housing
is $11,500, which funds trash collection and long-term building and grounds
maintenance.</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>The Pittsburgh Park and Playground Fund (PPPF) was established in 1936
by a group of prominent citizens to provide healthful outdoor recreation
in Pittsburgh. The Fund currently works to improve the quality of life
of less-advantaged Pittsburgh residents by involving them more closely
with nature, outdoor activities and urban amenity through the creation
of community gardens, floral plantings, parklets and playgrounds. The Fund
also funds park planning studies and the purchase of greenway areas.</p>

<p>PPPF funds its projects by identifying a potential project that already
has strong support from dedicated members of the community. PPPF then helps
implement the initial project by providing materials, services and/or funds.
The receiving party is then responsible for carrying out and maintaining
the project. By identifying projects that already have community support
and by ensuring that volunteers maintain a sense of ownership, PPPF&nbsp;has
enjoyed an extraordinarily high project success rate.</p>

<p>The benefits of the PPPF program are numerous. People who participate
in the local community gardens are rewarded by seeing formerly junk-filled
and littered vacant lots bloom, and they benefit from the consumption of
healthy food, outdoor exercise, contact with nature and interaction with
neighbors. </p>

<p>Flowerbeds and parklets help protect groundwater and reduce runoff.
Greenways established on Pittsburgh's steep hillsides help preserve forests,
stop runoff, alleviate air pollution and heat buildup, and preclude public
expenditures on steep roadways, walls and other infrastructures that would
be necessary without the greenways.</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Program Details</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The Fund capitalizes on enthusiasm for neighborhood projects by making
small grants and delivering materials quickly.</li>

<li>The Fund believes that by requiring &quot;sweat equity&quot; from volunteers,
a higher degree of commitment and success will be achieved. In order to
foster such an environment, the Fund, for example, requires that all community
gardeners install their own fences rather than hiring a contractor to do
the work.</li>

<li>In building urban &quot;parklets,&quot; the Fund originally identified
and converted abandoned, litter-strewn lots. In cases where a committed
group of volunteers was not identified simultaneously, the lots quickly
became garbage-strewn again. The Fund now supports only projects in which
individuals have been identified who will make a commitment to a particular
plot of land.</li>

<li>In order to ensure that floral displays are adequately cared for --
weeding, watering and trash pick up must occur twice a week -- volunteers
are paid an honorarium of $250 - $1,000 per season in three installments.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Government Involvement</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>More than half the funding for the program comes from government funds.</li>

<li>PPPF&nbsp;staff work with city officials to participate in the planning
process and to ensure an ongoing, positive relationship with city officials.</li>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>The Planet Newark Recycling Business Development Program promotes Newark
as a prime location to establish or expand a recycling business through
financial incentives such as loans, grants, tax benefits and other advantages.
To date, more than 80 recycling firms, employing more than 1,000 people,
have been established and are engaged in shipping and processing materials
such as paper, metals, plastics, chemical solvents and x-ray film.</p>

<p>Through this program, started in April 1994, the city of Newark seeks
to ensure that it has adequate markets for recyclable materials collected
from residents and businesses within its borders, which is a key factor
in ensuring that local recycling programs remain sustainable.</p>

<p><img src="pl_grdn.jpg" hspace=3 border=0 height=102 width=158 align=left>By
promoting a market approach to recycling, Newark is acting on the belief
that the private sector can, with greater efficiency and cost effectiveness
than municipal government, run material collection and processing centers.
These profitable centers will then serve to establish local markets for
recyclable goods, keeping transportation and processing costs down while
ensuring that the primary environmental benefits of recycling -- energy
savings, reduced water and air pollution, reduced pressure to mine virgin
materials, reduced use of petroleum for plastic production and reduced
consumption of trees from established forests -- will continue to be realized.</p>

<p>These environmental benefits can be dramatic: creating one ton of recycled
paper saves enough energy to power the average house for 6 months, saves
7,000 gallons of water and emits 60 fewer pounds of pollution than creating
one ton of virgin paper.</p>

<p>In addition to its environmental benefits, the program is designed to
generate local jobs and increase the municipal tax base, both of which
are beneficial to Newark's predominantly low-income population.</p>

<p>&quot;Recycling is the way of the future, and we will have no future
if we all do not make recycling an automatic part of our everyday lives,&quot;
says Sharpe James, Newark's Mayor.</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Planet Newark Relocation Incentive Kit</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The Planet Newark Relocation Incentive Kit features Planet Newark's
slogan: &quot;The #1 Environment for Environmental Businesses.&quot; The
Kit's attractive pocket folder and booklet describe the advantages of moving
a recycling facility to Newark. The booklet details available tax breaks,
grants and loans; describes the city's infrastructural features including
its labor force; and highlights the market for raw recyclables and recycled
goods.</li>

<li>The Kit also includes testimonials from operators of successful Newark
recycling firms.</li>

<li>This package is being marketed aggressively to operators of paper mills
and other members of the recycling industry.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Planet Newark Financial Incentives</font></b></p>

<p>There are a variety of economic development programs offered through
several agencies that are being made available to recycling firms. These
programs include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Low-interest loans from $50,000 to $500,000, with up to 10 years to
pay, for establishing a recycling operation.</li>

<li>Grants for research and development studies to establish a recycling
operation.</li>

<li>Sales tax exemptions on the purchase of recycling equipment.</li>

<li>Ninety percent loan guarantees (up to $1.5 million for fixed assets
and up to $1 million for working capital) for firms creating jobs at the
rate of one job per $25,000 of guarantee funds.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Firms Doing Business in Newark</font></b></p>

<p>More than 70 recycling firms have decided to locate in Newark, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Advanced Enterprises, which collects and recycles wood scraps and vegetative
material, such as leaves and twigs, to produce a decorative mulch used
by homeowners and nurseries.</li>

<li>Distributors Recycling, a subsidiary of Pure Tech, which processes
PET plastic soda bottles, glass, tin and aluminum containers.</li>

<li>Giordano's Paper Recycling recycles mixed office paper, computer paper,

<p>The Plymouth Institute is a consortium of environmental designers, eco-developers,
inventors, educators and artists working to develop sustainable living
and sustainable development demonstration programs. The Plymouth Institute's
hands-on technical education programs introduce inner-city school children
to 21st century careers based on principles of sustainability. Programs
highlight state-of-the-art construction, renewable energy, and subscription-based
organic agriculture. </p>

<p>The Institute evolved from the High Wind Association, an eco-community,
rural education and demonstration center founded in 1977 by a group of
friends with a deep commitment to help restore the balance between people
and nature. Originally limited to a construction project to build a passive
solar &quot;bioshelter&quot; that would produce rather than consume energy,
the High Wind Association soon evolved into a permanent community of individuals
-- most of whom constructed solar homes on the 128-acre site -- working
together to focus on the dynamics of interdependent community living. </p>

<p>In 1992, the Association bought a 144-acre site containing 19 artesian
wells, wetlands, more than 30 ponds, a fish hatchery, conference center
and cedar chalets. The residential community comprising the High Wind Association
became the High Wind Village and the Plymouth Institute was born.</p>

<p>Plymouth Institute is committed to programs that illustrate the importance
of the three &quot;E's:&quot; <b>environment, economics </b>and <b>equity.</b></p>

<ul>
<p><b>Environment:</b> A sustainable world is one in which human impact
does not exceed the carrying capacity of the natural environment. </p>

<p><b>Economics: </b>A sustainable world is one that provides people with
opportunities to meet their essential economic needs and to pursue a lifestyle
that is ecologically sensitive rather than destructive. </p>

<p><b>Equity: </b>A sustainable world is one that is free of conflict,
it is one in which all humans know peace and it is one in which all people
are treated justly.</p>
</ul>

<p>The Institute is committed to communicating its findings through publications,
presentations, consultations and university courses that deepen the meaning
of sustainable development and prepare students, teachers and citizens
at large for growing global interdependence.</p>

biology, organic farming and nature studies.</li>

<ul>
<li>Bunk rooms in the renovated barn are used for housing the students.</li>

<li>Students are trying vegetarian diets, some of them for the first time.</li>
</ul>

<li>The Institute's solar homes, both privately owned and those owned by
the Institute, have been visited by thousands of people who learn that
renewable energy can be both aesthetic and efficient.</li>

<li>Through cooperative efforts with the University of Wisconsin, the Institute
is developing conferences, retreats, consultations and seminars on sustainable
living.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Research, Development and Demonstration</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>A micro-hydropower initiative uses the Institute's artesian wells (water
in an artesian well flows upward due to forces generated within the earth)
to generate electricity.</li>

<li>Ponds on the property are aerated to increase fish density to speed
up the maturation process of the fish.</li>

<li>A biological waste treatment initiative uses bacteria, plants and fish
to treat sewage and purify waste water.</li>

<li>Construction on the site employs state-of-the-art resource- and energy-efficient
designs.</li>

<li>A wind farm is being developed to work in tandem with a photovoltaic
array to produce a hybrid renewable energy system.</li>

<li>All agricultural practices employ organic farming techniques.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Sustainable Enterprise</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The goal of the Plymouth Institute is to become economically self-sufficient
through the development of businesses, each of which illustrates conservation/sustainability
practices. To date, initiatives include:</li>

<ul>
<li>Selling organically-raised fish from the Institute's 30 ponds.</li>

<li>Selling artesian and spring water. (This initiative will be run by
inner-city families who will use their neighborhood contacts to get the
business off the ground.)</li>

<li>The Institute plans to develop eco-town houses using state-of-the-art
construction, renewable energy and biological systems.</li>

<li>Rental of the inn, bioshelter, remodeled farmhouse and four chalets
on the property.</li>

<li>The Institute 's 20-acre organic farm now feeds some 200 families in
metropolitan Milwaukee and the surrounding area with fresh-picked, chemical-free
produce through a <a href="http://www.sustainable.doe.gov/cgi-bin/sdp/ra.pl?NCAT013485">community-based

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>Prairie Crossing is a truly unique 667-acre residential development
located 40 miles from Chicago that is dedicated to environmental preservation
and community sustainability. In working to meet these goals, Prairie Crossing
is being developed at only 20% of the permitted density, and the 317 homes
within the development are being constructed with energy- and resource-efficient
technologies. More than 350 acres on the site have been protected from
any future development, with 200 acres comprising restored prairie and
150 acres dedicated to wetlands and working farm fields. In addition, numerous
efforts have been made to encourage community interaction, including the
preservation of a village green, and the development of trails, a lake
and a community-supported garden.</p>

<p>Prairie Crossing began as the dream of Gaylord and Dorothy Donnelley
and other neighbors on the Liberty Prairie Reserve. They were determined
to build and preserve a community where people could enjoy the beautiful
open landscape of Central Lake County, just as they did. </p>

<p>The participants in the project want to prove that small-scale, suburban
development, working in harmony with the environment, can be both environmentally
and economically successful. Rather than simply dividing a plot of land
into as many residential lots as possible, Prairie Crossing's mission --
as outlined in its ten guiding principles -- is to create a true community
within a sensitive natural environment. &quot;We want to be stewards of
this abundant ecological heritage,&quot; says Susan Meyer, coordinator
of the Liberty Prairie Conservancy, one of the groups working with the
developer to protect its hundreds of acres of prairie, farmland, wetland
and species habitat.</p>

<p><img src="pc_map.jpg" hspace=3 border=0 height=130 width=100 align=right>Restoration
and re-creation of more than 200 acres of native prairies and wetlands
will add critical habitat for native plant species in a region where development
and farming have traditionally destroyed habitat. The grasslands will attract
native and migratory birds and wildlife. A new lake, ponds, and restored
wetlands will appeal to a variety of waterfowl, wildlife and plant species.</p>

<p>To ensure that these areas are permanently protected, more than 350
acres of farmland, restored prairie, greenways, lakes, and natural areas
have been protected in perpetuity through easements donated to The Conservation
Fund and the Liberty Prairie Conservancy.</p>

<p>With homes ranging in size from 1,470 to 3,500 square feet, a marketing
and lending program have been devised to keep housing costs competitive,
to ensure the availability of affordable housing and to encourage minority
home ownership.</p>

<p>The first residents moved into Prairie Crossing in December 1994.</p>

<center><p><img src="mrule.gif" alt=" " border=0 height=5 width=640></p></center>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<p>The Prairie Crossing development follows ten guiding principles, which
include: Environmental Protection and Enhancement, a Healthy Lifestyle,
a Sense of Place, a Sense of Community, Economic and Racial Diversity,
Convenient and Efficient Transportation, Energy Conservation, Lifelong
Learning and Education, Aesthetic Design and High-Quality Construction
and Economic Viability.</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Environmental Protection and Enhancement</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Sixty percent of Prairie Crossing's 667 acres are protected from development.
Only 317 homes will be built, even though local zoning law would permit
the construction of 1,500 homes on the site.</li>

<li>Native plants are used in landscaping to reduce water demand.</li>

<li>Stormwater is managed sequentially through a series of open lands,
including grasslands, prairie, wetlands and lakes.</li>

<li>Half of one percent of each home sale and resale will go to the Liberty
Prairie Foundation to support environmental education and programs for
the region.</li>

<li>A nearby landfill company has agreed with Prairie Crossing to contribute
approximately $300,000 per year for 20 years to the Liberty Prairie Foundation,
which will give grants to environmentally-related projects.</li>

<li>Nearby historic buildings, saved from demolition, will be moved and
restored to form the Market Square.</li>

<li>An Environmental Team Leader will direct the stewardship of Prairie
Crossing's natural areas, as well as a volunteer program and environmental
education programs for residents and visitors. A primary goal of the Prairie
Crossing team is to educate Prairie Crossing residents to live in a way
that respects the land and conserves resources.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>A Sense of Community</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Architectural techniques (e.g., porches, large windows and shallow
&quot;setbacks,&quot; in which homes are built near the roadways) encourage
community interaction.</li>

<li>&quot;Community-building&quot; amenities include a 12-stall animal
barn, farm market, community center, tennis courts, fitness center, gardens,
a 22-acre lake and ten miles of interior trails linked to a regional trail
system and a new commuter rail station.</li>

<li>Two types of gardens serve the community. First, garden plots are available
to residents to grow fruit, vegetables and flowers in an ecologically-sound
manner. Second, a 150-member <a href="http://www.sustainable.doe.gov/cgi-bin/sdp/ra.pl?NCAT013485">community-supported
garden</a> enables subscribers, for $375 a year, to receive a basket of
organic, freshly-picked fruits, vegetables and flowers each of the 20 weeks
the farm is in production.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Energy Conservation</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Energy-efficient construction, a community-wide recycling program and
trails to encourage transportation by bikes and mass transit have all been
integrated into the development.</li>

<li>To minimize the need for air-conditioning, homes are designed for cross
breezes.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Convenient and Efficient Transportation</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Rail service to Chicago is now available within a five-minute drive,
and a new station to O'Hare International Airport and Chicago will open
adjacent to the development soon.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Economic and Racial Diversity</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The founders of Prairie Crossing believe that a mix of incomes and
races is essential to the future of our society. </li>

<li>A range of home prices are offered to provide affordable housing, and
an aggressive marketing and lending program to encourage minority home
ownership will ensure that residents are diverse in age, race, occupation
and household income. </li>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>Project Harambee (a Swahili word meaning &quot;let's pull together&quot;)
is a joint grassroots community effort of EarthBond and the Brown Village
of the Atlanta Project to reduce pollution and increase energy and water
conservation in Atlanta's Brown Village neighborhood.</p>

<p>Project Harambee distributed at no cost ultra-low-flush (ULF) toilets,
low-flow showerheads, and energy conservation information to 340 residents.
Local elementary schools participated in an environmental education program
at the same time.</p>

<p>In addition, Project Harambee offered energy demand management kits
to 100 residents. The energy conservation kits included a problem-solving
fact book, compact fluorescent bulbs, water heater blankets, pipe insulation
and caulking.</p>

<p>As a result, water consumption from the local Chattahoochee River has
been reduced by more than 56,000 gallons a day and community residents
are slated to save $200,000 over five years -- money that can be returned
to the local economy.</p>

<p>The Brown Village neighborhood, which is served by Project Harambee,
is one of the &quot;clusters&quot; that is a part of the Atlanta Project,
created by former President Jimmy Carter. The Atlanta Project was created
as a way to have people within the community solve the problems that concern
them. Simply put, the community has the ability to decide what it needs.</p>

<p>EarthBond, an Atlanta-based environmental nonprofit organization, began
a discussion with the Brown Village in 1992 to explore the possibility
of developing a collaborative community project. The discussion process
included a series of community forums and ultimately Brown Village executive
council meetings to get community approval for the proposal. By following
the Brown Village's &quot;bottom up&quot; approach to community empowerment,
the program was a success and earned greater commitment and a sense of
ownership by the residents than would have occurred otherwise.</p>

<p>Project Harambee has proven a win-win situation for all. The residents
have saved money, the City of Atlanta realizes water savings and reduced
pressure on the wastewater treatment facility, and jobs were created in
the community during the implementation of the project, providing much-needed
economic stimulation.</p>

<center><p><img src="mrule.gif" alt=" " border=0 height=5 width=640></p></center>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Project Details</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Pre-registration for the program consisted of residents identifying
themselves as having a need for a ULF toilet. Once the registrant was verified
as a resident of Brown Village, they signed a Produce Release form obligating
them to install the toilet within seven days, agreed to release their billing
history to help evaluate the toilet's performance, and they agreed to allow
the installation to be inspected.</li>

<li>Participants received an ultra-low flush toilet that operates at 1.6
gallons per use, compared to existing toilets that used use as much as
seven gallons of water per flush.</li>

<li>More than 90% of residents installed the toilets themselves, excluding
the elderly who received the services of Brown Village plumbers. Local
plumbers agreed to install the toilet for $25, but most completed the work
free of charge.</li>

<li>Six community jobs were created during the implementation of the project.
All residents engaged in employment were formerly unemployed individuals
who assisted in program management, canvassing, customer service, physical
distribution and tracking, and collection of old toilets.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Project Replication</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>This project was replicated in a federally designated Empowerment Zone
comprising several other Atlanta neighborhoods. In collaboration with the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Georgia Power Company, 1,500
ultra-low-flush toilets and 3,000 low-flow showerheads were distributed.
Organizers anticipate savings of 30 million gallons of water and $160,000
each year.</li>

<p>Rural Action's Rural Renewal Strategy empowers low-income residents
of the 29 counties of Appalachian Ohio to design and implement their own
solutions to the environmental and economic challenges they face.</p>

<p>More than 25 grassroots groups, 10 Rural Action issue-based committees,
numerous regional agency representatives and scores of individual citizens
participated in designing the Rural Renewal Strategy, a process by which
residents and volunteers identify local concerns and Rural Action lends
technical expertise to help citizens design appropriate, community-based
solutions.</p>

<p>Since 1993, Rural Renewal participants serving on various Rural Renewal
Committees have identified more than a dozen community needs throughout
southeast Ohio, including a desire for sustainable agricultural and grazing
practices; an organized, volunteer environmental work force; a program
for stream restoration; the delivery of high quality health care to rural
residents and the implementation of a rural, public transportation system.
In cooperation with VISTA&nbsp;(Volunteers in Service to America) volunteers,
more than a dozen projects have been implemented to help meet these needs.</p>

<p>Two core tenets of the Rural Renewal Strategy are that proposed solutions
should take advantage of local human capital, and that they should build
upon community strengths. &quot;We're trying to move this organization
toward thinking about what is good about a community, and how we can build
upon what is good,&quot; says Carol Kuhre, Executive Director of Rural
Action. &quot;There are three criteria by which we judge any project: it
must be sustainable to the environment, it must advance the rights of people,
especially those who have been disenfranchised, and it must actually include
those people in the process. It's this empowerment of people in the process
of revitalizing either their own lives or their communities that is really
central to what we're doing. We want to work with people to help themselves.&quot;

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Rural Action Network</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>A consortium of low-income residents, agency representatives, service
agencies, churches, funders and business leaders who have joined together
to determine how their collective experience can be used to create sustainable
agricultural, commercial and environmental initiatives for the region.
</li>

<li>The boom and bust economy of southeast Ohio has created a legacy of
unemployment, illiteracy and environmental degradation. The goal of the
Network is to develop collaborative enterprises that will work to address
these issues.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Harmar Mural Project</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>More than 300 school children from Harmar Elementary are constructing
a 900-square-foot mural depicting the history of Marietta. The Mural will
complement Marietta's river front and help instill a sense of pride and
empowerment among the community members creating it.</li>

<li>Working with a VISTA&nbsp;volunteer, the students helped develop the
concept for the mural, chose the subject matter and are now drawing the
images that they will paint.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Agricultural Marketing</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Most of the region's farm products are shipped for processing elsewhere
while the food that is consumed in the region is imported from outside
suppliers. Rural Action is working to reestablish small, diversified family
farms and local processing facilities.</li>

<li>The agricultural marketing team is developing strategies to sell these
products to local and regional consumers, many of whom are committed to
buying locally produced goods.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Agricultural Assessment</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>As the first step in creating a strategic plan to develop lower-impact,
more productive agriculture, Rural Action will develop a comprehensive
agricultural information database containing information about farmers'
needs, resources and production levels.</li>

<li>The database and complete assessment of the process will be made available
to other groups interested in a similar enterprise.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Sustainable Grazing</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Southeast Ohio has thousands of acres of unused and poorly managed
grazing land. This land could provide significant income for area farmers
while injecting $5 - $10 million into each of the region's economies. Organizers
are developing strategies to increase the use of controlled grazing among
area farmers.</li>

<li>Controlled grazing increases the diversity of the grasses and legumes,
thereby creating a soil-building permaculture that requires no tilling,
fertilizers or other chemical inputs.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Agriculture Education</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Conventional agricultural methods deplete topsoil, are capital intensive,
cause environmental damage and result in low profits. Rural Action is developing
an agriculture education program (for use in adult vocational agriculture
programs, high school and elementary school) to help local farmers restore
worn out land, increase their income and use fewer off-farm inputs.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Monday Creek Restoration Project</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Sulfuric acid drainage from abandoned mines, high iron concentrations,
log jams, garbage and debris have killed the 27-mile Monday Creek. The
pollution in the creek is so severe that the creek ranges in color from
bright orange to sickly green, and its banks are stained with the iron
color of the water they contain. Through a collaborative effort of more
than 25 organizations and agencies, Rural Action organizers hope to adopt
a technique developed in Pennsylvania in which artificial wetlands and
limestone drainage sinks remove heavy metals and neutralize the acid.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>RestoreCorps Restoration Program</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>RestoreCorps mobilizes local people to undertake community and ecological
restoration projects in their own communities, with the guidance of Rural
Action's environmental staff. The volunteer recruitment process emphasizes
an intergenerational membership.</li>

<li>Upcoming activities include founding a tree nursery to raise native
species for low-cost distribution; working to prevent erosion caused by
motorized vehicles in the Wayne National Forest; conducting a stream bank
stabilization project; reforesting reclaimed strip-mine land and maintaining
trees previously planted by the Arbor Day Committee.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Environmental Education Program</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Through a series of videos, seminars and six workshops, this program
offers to rural leaders information about environmental terminology, land
use, biological systems and pollution.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Rural Health Center</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Few rural residents of Appalachian Ohio have the opportunity to receive
consistent, quality health care. Many lack the resources to travel to a
distant town and pay for a visit to the doctor. Rural Action is creating
a health and wellness center where agencies can provide basic health care,
prenatal care, blood pressure and cholesterol screening, nutrition education
and counseling services.</li>

<li>The center will serve as the base of operations for Rural Action's
HealthCorps fieldwork.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Emergency Prescription Fund</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The emergency prescription fund helps purchase prescription medication
for low-income people with chronic or life-threatening conditions. Applicants
are first referred to the local branch of the Red Cross and the Athens
County Department of Human Services to determine if an alternate means
of medical assistance is available.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Rural Action Center</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>A former United Methodist Church, purchased for $1,500, is being converted
to a wellness and community center and will serve as the offices for Rural
Action's self-help housing project, transportation project, and Cooperative
Buying Network. From installing a kitchen and bath, to painting and landscaping,
Rural Action volunteers will complete the conversion themselves. Only the
framing and drywall installation will be hired out.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Rural Action and the South East Ohio Regional Free-Net
(SEORF)</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>SEORF is a National Public Telecomputing Network affiliate that provides
access to the Internet. Rural Action maintains a site on SEORF and is working
to promote use of the Internet to the Appalachian Ohio community.</li>

<li>The Internet can change the definition of what &quot;rural&quot; means.
Citizens can connect directly to U.S. government computers to review proposed
legislation or current environmental regulations, they can send email to
their Congressional leaders, or they can read the latest information from
Brazil or from an environmental group in West Virginia.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Rural Transportation Project</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Because rural Athens County has no public transportation, many people
cannot find a way to and from work, medical appointments or even the grocery
store. Through a collaborative effort among several area agencies, the
Rural Action County Transportation Link will provide free or low-cost van
transportation to Athens County residents.</li>

<li>Several models are under consideration, including a program that would
combine prearranged routes and scheduled stops with a limited &quot;dial-a-ride&quot;
system.</li>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>The Rutgers Urban Gardening Program (RUGP) is an educational public
service aimed at teaching gardening skills and helping city residents establish
gardens on city vacant lots. The conversion of debris-littered lots to
thriving, fertile gardens improves the neighborhood environment, raises
property values, and results in improved diets and socioeconomic well-being
for participating low-income families and individuals residing in Newark,
New Jersey and the surrounding area.</p>

<p>RUGP grew out of a series of pilot projects begun in six cities in the
United States in 1977. RUGP was formally created in 1978 and presently
more than 23 cities in the United States have adopted similar programs.</p>

<p>When RUGP was begun, there were more than 4,000 vacant city lots in
the Newark area, many strewn with garbage and other debris. At the same
time, officials knew that many Newark residents did not have enough money
to feed their families adequately. RUGP offered a solution: by turning
vacant lots into urban gardens, neighborhoods would be improved, land values
would rise, the city's cleanup and maintenance costs would decline and
most important, local residents would have access to nutritious, healthy
food at a reduced cost.</p>

<p>Through RUGP workshops and clinics designed to improve technical gardening
skills and teach good nutrition, more than 6,000 residents have learned
to garden, to compost, and to use mulch in creating organic gardens.</p>

<p>The program protects, restores and enhances the city's environment,
soil, water and air quality; improves public relations between communities
and the city and results in an increased sense of stewardship regarding
public lands without adversely affecting other sectors of the environment.</p>

<center><p><img src="mrule.gif" alt=" " border=0 height=5 width=640></p></center>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The city makes compost manure and leaves available to city gardeners.
Each year more than 4,000 tons of leaves are turned into leaf compost for
city gardening.</li>

<li>More than 95% of RUGP gardens are organic gardens.</li>

<li>An average garden of 700 square feet produces food valued at $500 at
a cost of just $25 a year. Each garden saves its gardener(s) $450 a year.</li>

<li>About 20% of program participants produce enough vegetables to feed
their families for the whole year.</li>

<li>RUGP helps achieve the goals of the Cooperative Extension's National
Initiatives, which include:</li>

<ul>
<li>Improving Nutrition, Diet and Health</li>

<li>Family and Economic Well-Being</li>

<li>Conservation and Management of Natural Resources</li>

<li>Building Human Capital</li>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>Saint Helena is a 240-acre island that lies two miles off the south
coast of Michigan's Upper Peninsula and has been uninhabited since the
early 1930's. Once the site of a busy nineteenth-century fishing community
and home to a still-functioning lighthouse, the island had become something
of a community eyesore until recently.</p>

<p>Suffering years of abandonment, the island had become a garbage dump
for unthinking individuals. The island's beaches were littered with debris,
and the lighthouse structure had all but been destroyed. Campers had started
two bonfires on the upstairs wooden floor of the lighthouse, causing significant
damage, and vandals had removed doors, shutters and windows from various
structures. More than 1,400 bricks had been pried from the oil house and
hauled away. </p>

<p>&quot;The Coast Guard had already declared all St. Helena light station
buildings except the light tower attractive nuisances and was thinking
of razing all but the tower,&quot; says Dick Moehl, president of the Great
Lakes Lighthouse Keepers Association (GLLKA). All that changed when the
GLLKA&nbsp;teamed up with local Boy Scout Troop 4 to reverse the island's
fortunes.</p>

<p>Six years and thousands of hours of labor later, the island has been
restored to its formerly pristine condition, osprey platforms and bat houses
have been constructed and censuses of the island's birds and mammals have
been conducted to help the Michigan Department of Natural Resources monitor
the island's environmental health.</p>

<p>In working on this project, not only has a historic site been saved
while preserving habitat for osprey, heron, bats and numerous other wildlife,
but the Boy Scouts have participated in demonstrating a conservation ethic:
young people are preserving and caring for something that is more than
one hundred years old, and they are seeing how doing so can energize a
community. They've even discovered that environmental preservation is good
for the economy.</p>

<p>The Michigan Department of Natural Resources is developing an Island
Explorer Waterways network for recreational boaters. Communities participating
in this network will benefit from the tourism dollars such an enterprise
will generate. St. Helena Island, with its light station, heron rookery,
and rich historical significance, has been suggested as an ideal destination
for inclusion in this network.</p>

<p>Jack Edwards, Boy Scout Troop 4's troop leader, when describing the
project often encounters disbelief from people who are convinced that the
work being performed on St. Helena Island couldn't possibly be done by
boys. &quot;On the contrary: the Great Lakes Lighthouse Keepers Association
had a lighthouse and needed free labor,&quot; says Edwards. &quot;The Scouts
had no lighthouse, but many willing hands. Together the Scouts and GLLKA
have demonstrated how two groups, with quite different charters, can work
together to accomplish something in which everyone can take pride.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>More than 900 cubic yards of debris were removed from the site, which
was then beautified by planting ornamental flowers and landscaping with
crushed limestone. Marine debris has been catalogued to examine debris
patterns on the island.</li>

<li>Construction of a visitors' center has begun. The center will offer
a history of the lighthouse, the island, and its flora and fauna.</li>

<li>Some aspects of the project, such as re-roofing the keeper's dwelling
and laying bricks to restore the double-walled oil house, required experienced
craftsmen. Other aspects, such as site cleanups, construction of the bat
houses, construction of the osprey platforms and the construction of the
visitor's center were accomplished with Scout and volunteer labor.</li>

<li>Scout labor was used as an in-kind donation to provide the matching
funds required by the Bicentennial Lighthouse Fund.</li>

<ul>
<li>Osprey platforms, constructed according to Michigan Department of Natural
Resource plans, have been installed to provide alternative habitat for
these large fish-eating birds that were evicted when the windows and roof
were re-installed on the light tower.</li>

<li>Bat houses have been placed on the keeper's dwelling and nearby trees
to provide homes for bats displaced by the installation of windows and
doors.</li>
</ul>

<li>The light station was landscaped with indigenous limestone and plants
to avoid the use of herbicides in order to protect the herons that come
to St. Helena Island each spring to bear and raise their young.</li>

<li>Small mammal and bird censuses have been conducted. As a result of
the bird census, a <i>Birds of St. Helena Indentification Guide</i> was
prepared for island visitors. A total of sixty-four species of birds has
been identified on the island including warblers, loons and other water
birds, herons, ospreys and eagles.</li>

<li>More than 299 species of plants have been catalogued on the island.</li>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>Sustainable Living Center (SLC) hostels employ energy- and resource-efficient
practices to educate both travellers and the local community about sustainable
living. </p>

<p>Hostels provide a unique opportunity in this regard because, unlike
other temporary accommodations such as hotels, in a hostel people participate
in the daily household activities. They cook, do laundry and other household
chores. In this way, Sustainable Living Center hostels become experiential
laboratories where people can participate in low-impact lifestyles that
are easily transferred into their homes and workplaces.</p>

<p>In order to participate in the Sustainable Living Center program, each
hostel must develop environmentally-friendly programs such as energy conservation,
water conservation, waste reduction and nontoxic product usage. SLC hostels
principally use off-the-shelf, simple economical technology and resources
to make hostels energy, water and waste efficient. Fluorescent lighting,
insulation and low-flow faucets and shower heads are examples of the types
of technologies that are commonly employed.</p>

<p>But what enables the program to work within the diverse hostel community
-- hostels are large and small, urban and rural and located in many different
climates -- is the flexibility that is granted to hostel managers to tailor
projects to their specific environments and communities. The Harper's Ferry,
Maryland hostel managers, for example, planned an overnight program for
inner-city youth that included household conservation, Appalachian Trail
maintenance and Black history.</p>

<p>Originally, Hostelling International-American Youth Hostels' (HI-AYH)
goal was to work with four hostels to establish organizational models.
However, due to hostel managers' enthusiastic response, more than 20 hostels
volunteered to participate.</p>

<center><p><img src="mrule.gif" alt=" " border=0 height=5 width=640></p></center>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>An action guide assists hostel managers with their efforts to become
SLCs. The book offers simple program implementation instruction, concrete
examples, and lists of resources.</li>

<li>Hostel managers are encouraged to exercise their independence and creativity
to engage in low-impact living practices that are specific to their communities:</li>

<ul>
<li>A hostel manager in a Pennsylvania state park picks up undeliverable
mail from the local post office and takes it to a paper mill for recycling.</li>

<li>The manager at Martha's Vineyard hostel organizes hostellers as volunteers
for local nature conservation projects.</li>

<li>The Austin, Texas hostel involves at-risk youth in water testing.</li>

<li>One hostel practices vermicomposting (introducing worms into the compost).</li>

<li>The San Francisco regional office conducts environmental programs for
inner-city youth at coastal hostels.</li>

<li>The Crowley Lake, California hostel manager maintains National Forest
trails and takes hostellers out on interpretive trips.</li>
</ul>

<li>Graduate students in architectural design in the Ecological Design
Program at University of California (Berkeley) developed and executed plans
for four San Francisco Bay hostels to become advanced SLC&nbsp;hostels.</li>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>Sustainable Urban/Rural Enterprise (SURE) is a civic nonprofit corporation
promoting the dual goals of economic development and environmental stewardship
for the City of Richmond and Wayne County.</p>

<p>In fulfilling its mission, SURE&nbsp;promotes enterprises that are consistent
with its principles of sustainability -- that the only development-related
activities that are pursued are those that can be perpetuated continuously
by future generations, that economic and agricultural systems should be
both adaptable and resilient, and that no development activity should deplete
the natural resource base.</p>

<p>These principles were synthesized from the U.N.-sponsored report, <i>Our
Common Future</i>, which defines sustainability and spells out the very
real environmental and economic consequences that will be imposed by a
declining ecological resource base upon which all nations and communities
depend. In beginning its application of the principles of sustainability,
SURE&nbsp;is looking first at agriculture in the Richmond area.</p>

<p>Indiana's two largest crops, corn and soybeans, account for 80% of the
state's crop sales, and many Indiana grain farmers do not grow anything
else. As a result, much of Indiana's produce must be imported. Indiana
farmers could grow many of the additional crops consumed by Indiana residents,
if the right incentives were provided. &quot;We're trying to plug up the
holes in the economic bucket and quit importing what we can grow here,&quot;
said Lynn Johnstone, Wayne County SURE&nbsp;Director. </p>

<p>In addition to promoting diversified agriculture, SURE&nbsp;is also
working on initiatives to reduce soil erosion and chemical use, to maintain
greenery and trees on farmland, and to study hydroponics in greenhouses.
</p>

<p>SURE principles are being applied to numerous economic enterprises in
addition to agriculture. To help explore the application of these principles,
SURE&nbsp;hosted an economic development conference in 1990 that brought
together leaders in sustainable enterprise strategies from across the nation.
Attendees discussed the implementation of SURE&nbsp;principles in each
of eight areas, and efforts are underway to implement conference recommendations.</p>

<p>Other SURE&nbsp;initiatives include recycling, recycled product manufacturing,
and the development of neighborhood gardens.</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>SURE&nbsp;Workshop</font></b></p>



<ul>
<li>In 1990, SURE&nbsp;hosted a national workshop designed to identify
sustainable enterprise principles that could be implemented in the following
areas:</li>

<ul>
<li>Economic models.</li>

<li>Waste water treatment</li>

<li>Land use</li>

<li>Energy competitiveness</li>

<li>Enterprise zone incubators</li>

<li>Agriculture</li>

<li>Communications</li>

<li>Quality of life</li>
</ul>

<li>SURE&nbsp;will serve as an information clearinghouse regarding the
implementation of the recommendations of the workshop, and will make this
information available to other communities.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Agriculture Initiatives</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>To help protect local agriculture, to reduce inefficient importation
of produce that could be grown locally, and to keep dollars flowing through
the local economy, SURE&nbsp;engages in the following initiatives:</li>

<ul>
<li>SURE&nbsp;works with local restaurants to encourage them to use local
produce.</li>

<li>SURE is putting together a survey to identify local produce needs and
to match farmers with consumers. </li>

<li>SURE is encouraging increased diversity in Indiana's crops. Several
new crops, including asparagus, bamboo, mushrooms, beeswax, flax seed,
honey, maple sugar, oats, wheat, grapes, rye, apples, raspberries and strawberries
have been identified as possible alternative crops.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Other Initiatives</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>A Geographical Information System (GIS) is being used to expand the
inventory of Indiana's natural resources to be used in land-use planning.
Such resources include aquifers, forests, physical geology, soils, vegetation,
wetlands and wildlife habitat.</li>

<li>The construction of wetlands to purify sewage rather than building
additional waste water treatment facilities is being considered.</li>

<p>TechPark is a business park and neighborhood revitalization project
located in Rock Hill, South Carolina. The park, which contains 10 acres
of lakes, community walking trails and wooded areas, was built upon a site
adjacent to an abandoned cotton mill and serves as an example of a successful
community revitalization effort that combines economic development, revitalization
of a low-income neighborhood, and preservation of natural beauty and wildlife
habitat.</p>

<p>The Manchester Cotton Mill, built in 1891 and closed in 1981, served
as the nucleus of economic activity in the Rock Hill area. At its peak,
the mill employed more than 1,500 people. After its closing, however, the
mill property and adjacent residential properties depreciated, and the
area quickly deteriorated.</p>

<p>In March 1988 the Rock Hill City Council adopted the Manchester Redevelopment
Plan, designed to revitalize the area surrounding the mill by building
a business park, rehabilitating the mill and its surrounding steam generation
lakes, and attracting private investment. The Plan also included beautification
efforts that included creating public green space, improving the neighborhood
residential area and working with the community to help plan future development.</p>

<p>TechPark has been an enormous success. Numerous new businesses have
been attracted to the area, serving as the employment base for nearly 1,000
local residents. The redevelopment plan's dedication to natural resource
conservation has ensured the preservation of local wooded areas and the
steam generation lakes surrounding the mill, providing habitat for a variety
of local wildlife. In addition, a neighborhood park has been constructed,
which serves the adjacent low-income community. Improvements in the region
have raised property values, increasing the wealth of local community property
owners.</p>

<p>Finally, the development has attracted good corporate citizens. The
aesthetic beauty of the area is highly valued by corporate residents of
TechPark, and they have made efforts to thank the community for the opportunity
they have been given. A consortium of TechPark businesses, for example,
have made a donation to a local radio station to air &quot;Ed Line,&quot;
a talk show about Rock Hill schools hosted by Rock Hill schools Superintendent
Phil McDaniel.</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>The EarthWays Home is a renovated, 4,500 square-foot house in St. Louis,
Missouri that serves as an environmental education and demonstration facility.
It is designed to challenge students and other visitors to evaluate the
environmental impact of their everyday decisions, and to educate them about
how they might change their own use of energy and resources. </p>

<p>The three-story house, built in 1885, employs composting and recycling
systems, energy-efficient appliances and lighting, water conservation,
a geothermal heating and cooling system, a natural gas pulse jet furnace,
a photovoltaic system and environmentally-sound building techniques and
materials.</p>

<p>&quot;We [used] only products that are available to the public today
because we want them to know they can make these types of changes to their
own homes,&quot; says Alex Bornstein, co-director of the project. &quot;That's
why it was important to renovate an old house instead of building a new
one. We are, in essence, recycling a house.&quot;</p>

<p>Daily tours offer a variety of workshops and classes. Students can see
how a municipal water-purification system works, and they can build their
own mini-cities, attaching water and sewer lines to each building. Information
is provided about the life cycle process of water flowing into and out
of the St. Louis watershed. Ultimately, visitors to the home learn how
they can reduce the energy and resource consumption in a typical home by
50% to 80% by applying specific technology and engaging in small lifestyle
changes.</p>

<p>Both verbal and written evaluations of the home are provided by visitors
to ensure that the home continues to challenge, teach, and display the
latest technologies.</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>The Farm is a communal settlement that practices sustainable, developmentally-progressive
village living. With about 250 full-time residents, The Farm offers all
the necessities and amenities of any community: grocery store, medical
clinic, filling station, schools, water system, pharmacy, post office,
cemetery and scores of businesses and residences. The difference between
this community and others, however, is in the way the community functions.
All agriculture on The Farm is organic. The buildings were constructed
entirely from salvaged, recycled and local materials. In sum, the value
of community and a respect for life are emphasized on The Farm. The community
has no poverty, little domestic violence, and virtually no crime. Guns
and other weapons are forbidden on The Farm.</p>

<p>The Farm began in 1971 when 300 people, riding in buses, arrived in
Summertown, Tennessee intent on building a communal society. These first
arrivals were the followers -- literally -- of San Francisco university
professor Stephen Gaskin who had been touring the country to deliver his
message about a shared society. When the caravan pulled back into San Francisco
at the tour's end, Gaskin's fans knew they had found something special.
&quot;We didn't want to separate,&quot; Gaskin says. So the group decided
to make a go of Gaskin's vision and create a communal society together.
&quot;We had found two places where the people were really nice -- Tennessee
and Minnesota,&quot; says Gaskin. &quot;But Minnesota...it was too cold.&quot;</p>

<p>The original 320 settlers entered their wealth and belongings into a
common pot. On a budget of $1 per person per day and no grants, food stamps
or welfare, the settlers bought the land, erected the buildings and became
agriculturally self-sufficient within four years. These settlers built
schools; greenhouses; dry good and grocery stores; automotive, welding
woodworking and machine shops; a health clinic, laboratory, dispensary,
a neonatal intensive care unit and infirmary. At the end of five years,
much of the infrastructural work was complete. Not only that, but more
than 60 Farm residents had received medical training and were providing
medical care to the underserved within a 20-mile radius of The Farm.</p>

<p>About the same number of residents live on The Farm now as when it was
established, but this was not always true. The Farm population had swelled
from 300 to nearly 1,500 during the early 1980's, but it soon became clear
that such a large population could not be sustained at The Farm. A series
of agricultural setbacks helped punctuate the point. The community underwent
a significant scaling back in size in about 1983. Simultaneously, for the
first time, residents were allowed to hold some private property, although
The Farm deed is still held in common. </p>

<p>During this transition, The Farm halved its agricultural area, relocated
outlying settlements to protect neighboring hardwood forests, and zoned
off more than half its acreage from all development to help preserve natural
biodiversity. Having recently acquired an additional 800 acres, The Farm
has established a charitable conservation land trust with the goal of acquiring
and preserving the entire upper Swan watershed.</p>

<p>The Farm is now also launching the Ecovillage Network of North America,
an effort to link a wide variety of green communities, Eco-City projects
and ecovillages, and to encourage a transition from the traditional Western
consumer lifestyle to one of sustainable development. Two other projects
of The Farm -- The Natural Rights Center and the Environmental Resource
Center -- already provide instruction on how communities can pursue sustainable
development policies.</p>

<center><p><img src="mrule.gif" alt=" " border=0 height=5 width=640></p></center>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Agriculture</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>In sum, more than 300 acres of previously marginal land have been restored
to productive organic gardening.</li>

<li>All waste is composted and used as fertilizer.</li>

<li>Organic agriculture methods, including polyculture, heritage seeds,
cover cropping, crop rotation and the preservation of beneficial insects,
are pursued.</li>

<li>Snakes, lizards, toads and turtles provide organic pest control.</li>

<li>Apiaries were constructed to pollinate fields, nurseries and orchards.</li>

<li>The Farm Education Conference Center offers lectures and workshops.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Energy Efficiency</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Since 1978, all buildings constructed at The Farm utilize solar energy
and other energy-efficient designs.</li>

<li>The Farm School is the largest passive solar school in the state. The
school was constructed with numerous recycled materials and utilizes an
earth-berm design.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Food Science</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The Farm formed the Global Village Institute for Appropriate Technology,
which financed the creation of a food sciences laboratory. In cooperation
with the United States Department of Agriculture, The Farm experimented
with a number of soy foods. Among The Farm's creations were the first soy-based
ice creams and soy burgers.</li>

<li>In 1985, the food science laboratory was transferred to The Farm's
Tempeh Lab, which today is the nation's largest supplier of soy fermentation
innoculants.</li>

<li><i>Mushroompeople</i>, a commercial enterprise for The Farm, is one
of the nation's largest mail order suppliers of specialty mushroom spawn
and growing supplies.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Habitat Conservation</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>In 1992, The Farm formed the Swan Conservation Land Trust to purchase
and preserve the entire upper Swan River watershed. This area is rich in
endangered species, including the yellow-eyed grass, the grass of Parnassus,
the Fen orchid, the Small-headed rush, Eggert's sunflower and the Tennessee
Snaketail dragonfly.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Technical Developments</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The Farm's first chicken wire satellite dishes led to an electronics
company, Solar Electrics International, and spawned the craze for CB (citizens'
band) radio.</li>

<li>Additional technical pursuits led to the creation of <i>International
Satellite Orbit</i> magazine and the development of the first truly accurate,
low-cost hand-held Geiger meters (with more than $1 million in orders in
1994).</li>

<li>The Farm has also helped build the world's sixth largest photovoltaic
array, and established the WELL (Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link) network on
the Internet.</li>

<li>The midwifery program, established in 1971, has delivered more than
2,000 babies with outcome statistics better than hospitals (Cesarean rates
are only 1.8% versus 25% in hospitals) in large part due to comprehensive,
family-based support programs in prenatal and postnatal education, nutrition
and care.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Sustainable Development Initiatives</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>In 1974, the Farm launched its ambitious Plenty project, an effort
to spread the wealth available within &quot;homegrown communities&quot;
and self-taught skills to those in less fortunate circumstances. Today
Plenty is active in 12 countries on four continents, piping water to remote
villages, training health care workers, reforesting wastelands, building
schools and municipal buildings and establishing cooperative gardening
projects.</li>

<li>The Farm is home to the Natural Rights Center and helped launch the
Environmental Resource Center, both of which provide information to communities
who wish to pursue sustainable development. </li>

<li>The Farm is launching the Ecovillage Network of North America and also
serves as regional headquarters for the Global Village Network, which publishes
<i><a href="http://www.gaia.org/dx">The Design Exchange</a></i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Publications/Bookstore</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Since its creation in 1971, The Farm's <i>The Book Publishing Company</i>
has offered dozens of books on vegetarian and vegan cooking, sustainable
agriculture, women's health, general health, the environment, and Native
American issues for sale. </li>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>The Good Neighbor Project (GNP) provides an innovative approach to empowering
local residents to promote only sustainable, non-polluting industries within
their communities. GNP provides legal, technical and strategic expertise
to help residents secure &quot;Good Neighbor Agreements,&quot; which are
legally-binding documents signed by the corporation and all community stakeholders
that contain solutions to the community's environmental and economic concerns.
About 75% of the recipients of GNP's services are low-income and minority
communities. </p>

<p>A key to the GNP approach is to identify and enlist the support of community
stakeholders, particularly the community workforce. The solutions that
are promoted -- accident prevention and pollution prevention -- are not
neutral in regard to labor. In working to reduce pollution, a plant might
automate, thus cutting jobs. Alternatively, a plant may save jobs if an
inefficient and endangered production line is brought back from the brink
of extinction through toxics use reduction (TUR), which can cut waste elimination
costs, compliance costs and other overhead costs. In any case, strong participation
on the part of the workforce will help ensure solutions that are beneficial
to labor, the corporation, and the community.</p>

<p>In addition to providing solutions that reduce pollution and save money,
by encouraging principled negotiation between communities and corporations,
the goals of both participants can be identified early in the process.
This way the corporation can avoid the &quot;moving target&quot; phenomenon
so common when community objectives shift from week to week as a result
of a lack of a stable relationship between the corporation and the community.</p>

<p>Everyone wins with this approach to reduce pollution, protect the environment,
and create sustainable industry: the Good Neighbor Project helps save jobs,
increases corporate donations to affected areas and improves the quality
of life in neighborhoods, thus elevating property values. Industries benefit
by gaining new information, better community relationships, potential for
cost-savings in the solutions that are developed and avoidance of adversarial
relations that can lead to costly liability suits.</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Principles</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The Good Neighbor Project trains community activists to engage in principled
negotiations with corporations toward the establishment of Good Neighbor
Agreements that meet the community's needs and concerns.</li>

<li>Community stakeholders are included in the plant review process so
that corporations are motivated continuously to improve on environmental
safety and to maintain a strong, healthy link to the community. At the
sites where the GNP approach has been employed, safety and environmental
performance have been improved.</li>

<li>Corporations are encouraged to hire outside firms to conduct health,
environment and safety (HES) audits. A thorough audit can help firms save
money by reducing materials and energy waste or curtailing chemical accident
risks. Internal audits can be hampered by a corporation's internal bureaucracy
or politics, resulting in the possibility that certain HES&nbsp;risks may
go unidentified. Conducting outside, community-involved audits significantly
reduces this possibility.</li>

<li>At a number of sites, environmental monitoring of the industry's impact
has been expanded, resulting in improvements such as split sampling, the
drilling of more environmental monitoring wells and the installation of
advanced air pollution detectors.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Good Neighbor Agreement with Chevron Richmond Refinery</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>GNP teamed up with the West County Toxics Coalition and several community
groups to help a predominantly African-American community in Richmond,
California communicate their concerns about pollution generated by the
Chevron Richmond Refinery located in their community. Through a series
of negotiations, GNP helped secure a Good Neighbor Agreement among the
parties in which Chevron agreed to:</li>

<ul>
<li>Install 350 &quot;leakless&quot; valves in a new project and retrofit
200-400 valves in the existing refinery.</li>

<li>Continue to reduce toxic emissions from the refinery beyond the 60%
achieved between 1988-1992.</li>

<li>Provide skilled job training to 100 local residents.</li>

<li>Contribute $2 million to a local health center.</li>

<li>Install sirens and computers, train emergency workers and establish
and fund a city Emergency Services coordinator position for five years.</li>

<li>Redirect $5 million in corporate philanthropy to nearest and poorest
neighbors over five years.</li>

<li>Spend $100,000 over 3 years to restore native vegetation along bayshore
property.</li>

<li>Work with East Bay Regional Parks to complete a feasibility study for
constructing a bike trail from Pt. Richmond to Pt. San Pablo.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Good Neighbor Agreement with Union Oil Company (Unocal)</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>GNP worked with Citizens for a Better Environment and other groups
to represent the residents of Rodeo, California, who were concerned about
a planned expansion to a Unocal hydrogen regeneration plant. A&nbsp;leak
from the plant's existing facility had recently occurred, and chemicals
had drifted over the community where more than 300 people complained of
ill health effects. In the Good Neighbor Agreement that was created during
negotiations, Unocal agreed to:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>Create a community-labor-management committee to conduct its own audit
of safety and pollution prevention at the Unocal Refinery.</li>

<li>Allow a community advisory panel to review the firm's own annual audits
of safety and compliance.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>The Green Guerillas, Inc. is a nonprofit, volunteer urban greening organization
in New York City. Its members make the city a better place to live by helping
community groups and individuals plant gardens and trees, create parks
and develop play and picnic areas where often only concrete and rubble
existed before. </p>

<p>The Green Guerillas were formed in 1973 by Liz Christy, a lower east
side resident, and her neighbors, to clean up the garbage-strewn, abandoned
lots in their area. They take their name from their first urban greening
activity -- lobbing peat &quot;grenades&quot; stuffed with wildflower seeds
into the lots. Soon after, the efforts of the organization became more
formal, but the name stuck. </p>

<p><img src="gg_work.jpg" border=0 height=119 width=183 align=left>The
Green Guerillas now work in partnership with the city to provide individuals
and community groups the tools necessary to convert neighborhood vacant
lots into green gardens. The group gets would-be gardeners in touch with
the right city agencies to ensure long-term access to the lots, offers
horticulture training and provides free plants, shrubs, trees and soil.</p>

<p>&quot;We never go out and simply plant a garden somewhere; communities
come to us,&quot; says Barbara Earnest, Green Guerillas' Executive Director.
&quot;Without community involvement, community investment, the gardens
would die as soon as we left.&quot;</p>

<p>The efforts of the Green Guerillas to encourage and assist in citywide
urban greening have helped to unite people of diverse backgrounds to invest
in their neighborhoods and communities. Often, the creation of block associations
and increased citizen participation follow the planting of a garden.</p>

<p>&quot;A garden can turn a neighborhood around, give everyone a sense
of empowerment, of possibilities, of problems conquered,&quot; says Earnest.
&quot;Most of all, a garden gives hope.&quot;</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<p><img src="gg_tree.jpg" border=0 height=125 width=186 align=right></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>How Does the Program Work?</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>An individual or group calls the Green Guerillas and expresses an interest
in establishing a community garden.</li>

<li>The Green Guerillas conduct a site visit, make recommendations and
draw up a design.</li>

<li>Volunteers provide technical expertise and labor, and offer free plants,
shrubs, trees and soil.</li>

<li>Volunteers conduct follow up visits to see if materials have been used
optimally. They also help the community gardeners work against vandalism,
insects and disease.</li>

<li>The Green Guerillas will provide technical assistance to any gardener,
as long as the sponsoring individual or organization provides public access
to the garden or provides a social service to the community.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Projects</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The Green Guerillas collect and distribute thousands of dollars worth
of donated plants and garden supplies to community gardens. The donated
materials come from a variety of sources. Recently the Guerillas collected
shrubbery from a museum, perennials and large planters from Rockefeller
Center, trees from a Park Avenue penthouse, lumber from a closing disco
and bulbs from the Parks department.</li>

<li>The Green Guerillas offer an eight-week job training program in horticulture,
providing the homeless with marketable skills.</li>

<li>The group publishes handbooks, newsletters and fact sheets on gardening.</li>

<li>The group has developed workshops on topics such as tree planting,
the garden in winter, signmaking, wildflower planting and fence making.
</li>

<li>The Green Guerillas recycle Christmas trees in cooperation with the
New York City Department of Sanitation, delivering mulch to gardens all
over the city.</li>

<li>The group assists an AIDS&nbsp;resource center with its garden.</li>

<li>The group is helping residents of a co-op apartment for formerly homeless
families plant trees and put in tree guards around their new home.</li>

<li>The Green Guerillas were featured in the 1991 movie <i>Green Card</i>,
starring Andie MacDowell and Gerard Depardieu.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Green Facts</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Trees and plants cool the environment, and will clean and filter up
to 60 pounds of pollutants from the air each year.</li>

<li>A one-acre lot of trees and vegetation can absorb up to two tons of
acid-rain-causing sulphur dioxide.</li>

<li>Twenty trees can provide the same cooling benefits provided by one
air conditioner.</li>

<p>The Henry's Fork Watershed Initiative is an innovative effort by the
Henry's Fork Foundation to address land management issues, coordinate research
and help develop natural resource policy in eastern Idaho's Henry's Fork
Basin. Central to the success of the Initiative is the Henry's Fork Watershed
Council, a diverse collection of scientists, federal, state and local agencies
and concerned nonprofit organizations who have entered into an unconventional
consensus-building process that enables even formerly adversarial entities
to work productively together.</p>

<p>The Henry's Fork Basin, located in eastern Idaho and western Wyoming,
encompasses 1.7 million acres and more than 3,000 miles of rivers, streams
and irrigation canals. The headwaters area features high mountain streams
and abundant spring sources, providing for healthy populations of fish
and wildlife, including several threatened and endangered species. The
three Idaho counties and one Wyoming county in the basin have a combined
population of 40,000. As the population of the basin continued to increase
(Teton County, Idaho is growing at an annual rate of 10.6%) and nationwide
concern for the environment mounted, regional disputes over traditional
land use and land management methods became more difficult to resolve.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1993, a number of federal, state and local agencies
met to discuss these issues and they appointed the Henry's Fork Foundation
and the Fremont-Madison Irrigation District, two former adversaries, to
co-facilitate an effort to better appreciate the complex watershed relationships
in the Henry's Fork Basin, to restore and enhance watershed resources where
needed, and to maintain a sustainable watershed resource base for future
generations. The result of this dual effort was the development of the
Henry's Fork Watershed Council.</p>

<p>In addition to the Henry's Fork Watershed Council, the Henry's Fork
Foundation is supporting watershed research within the Henry's Fork Basin,
the Foundation has hired a Research Coordinator to provide a scientific
review of agency proposals, and the Foundation is developing a comprehensive
resource library and computer database for use by both the public and private
sectors.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Henry's Fork Foundation supports research in the areas of hydrogeology,
aquatic ecology and juvenile trout survival within the Henry's Fork Basin.</li>

<li>To integrate research findings into agency policy and management, the

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>The Henry's Fork Watershed Council</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The Council's charter identifies four major duties for the Henry's
Fork Watershed Council:</li>

<ul>
<li>To cooperate in resource studies and planning that transcend jurisdictional
boundaries, while respecting the mission, roles, water and other rights
of each participating entity.</li>

<li>To review and critique proposed watershed projects and Basin Plan recommendations,
suggesting priorities for their implementation by appropriate agencies.</li>

<li>To identify and coordinate funding sources for research, planning and
implementation of long-term monitoring programs, with financing derived
from both public and private sectors.</li>

<li>To serve as an educational resource to the Legislature and the general
public, communicating the Council's progress through regular reports, media
forums and other presentations.</li>
</ul>

<li>The Council developed the Watershed Integrity Review and Evaluation
(WIRE)&nbsp;Process to address social and cultural concerns, economic diversity
and sustainability issues. The WIRE&nbsp;process is used as a tool to help
the Council determine whether or not it can reach consensus on the issue
at hand.</li>

<li>An average of 60 individuals representing the scientific community
and federal, state, local and tribal entities attend the Council's monthly
meetings.</li>

<li>At least 25 federal, state and local agencies were found to have management
or regulatory jurisdiction in the Henry's Fork Basin, which was contributing
to fragmented planning and decisionmaking and hindering progress in addressing
soil erosion, water delivery and water quality problems. The unique structure
and process of the Council has enabled it to reach a consensus on a variety
of watershed issues, and to communicate that consensus to appropriate agencies.</li>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>The Lighthouse Farm Network (LFN) is a collection of &quot;lighthouse,&quot;
or model, farms demonstrating alternative farming methods that are both
economically viable and ecologically sound. These farms serve to guide
other farmers interested in reducing chemical inputs through a process
of farmer-to-farmer sharing. To help facilitate this communication, LFN
sponsors monthly meetings and field days and provides technical information
and support to all those interested in biologically-based practices.</p>

<p>The Lighthouse Farm Network grew out of a campaign launched by the California
Action Network in May 1990 called &quot;Farmers for Alternative Agriculture
Research (FAAR).&quot; With the help of farmers, researchers and agricultural
experts, FAAR&nbsp;published a report, <i>Reducing the Use of Pesticides
in Agriculture:&nbsp;A Farmer's Perspective</i>, which offers a<i> </i>blueprint
for moving agriculture to more sustainable methods. The publication comes
at a time when farmers across the country face the possibility of losing
many synthetic pesticides in the near future due to public pressure, regulation
and diminishing effectiveness of such pesticides.</p>

<p>By employing sustainable agricultural methods, farmers can engage in
a transition from an industry that is currently chemically-intensive to
one that is environmentally-sensitive. Right now, agricultural chemicals
are commonly found contaminating our food supply, drinking water, air and
rivers. Their routine production, transport and use are responsible for
acute poisonings of agricultural and industrial workers; chronic, debilitating
health problems in rural communities and destruction of the soil. In a
sustainable agriculture environment, soil will be enriched, rather than
impoverished, by growing food.</p>

<p><i>Reducing the Use of Pesticides in Agriculture:&nbsp;A Farmer's Perspective
</i>identifies initiatives to provide financial incentives that reward
environmentally responsible farming while making environmentally ruinous
methods more costly. It calls for the dissemination of information regarding
the benefits inherent in sustainable agriculture, for strengthening communication
between farmer and consumer through a public outreach program and for new
research into ecologically sound farming systems that do not rely on synthetic
chemicals.</p>

<p>&quot;We believe that research over the past few years has been directed
toward increasing crops -- and making more money -- but what people didn't
realize was the environmental cost of using chemicals,&quot; says Paul
Buxman, a peach grower and blueprint signatory.</p>

<p><i>Reducing the Use of Pesticides in Agriculture:&nbsp;A Farmer's Perspective
</i>has been endorsed by organizations representing more than 1,000 family
farmers and California's Lieutenant Governor.</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Sustainable Agriculture Techniques</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li><b>Use of pheromone decoys.</b> Pheromones from the female of a destructive
insect species are applied to trees, diluting the scent of the females
that may be present and reducing the likelihood of species reproduction.</li>

<li><b>Planting of cover crops.</b> Various weeds and flowers are planted
among the crops to provide a home for beneficial insects and to supply
the soil with nutrients.</li>

<li><b>Use of natural predators.</b> Farmers make their crops hospitable
to spiders, ladybugs, wasps and beetles, which feed on potential pests
and predators. This can be accomplished through:</li>

<ul>
<li>Importation of natural enemies to combat non-native pests.</li>

<li>Habitat enhancement to support natural enemies that are already present.</li>

<li>The release or application of natural enemies onto crops so their numbers
will be temporarily high enough to suppress pests.</li>

<p>The Midwest Wind Energy Program (MWEP) is a joint effort of Waverly
Light &amp; Power (WL&amp;P) and the University of Northern Iowa to install
and operate an 80-kilowatt wind turbine in northern Iowa. The program is
designed to incorporate new advances in wind energy technology and to provide
WL&amp;P with experience and knowledge in operating and maintaining a wind-generation
system.</p>

<p>Waverly Light &amp; Power is a 32 megawatt (MW) municipally-owned electric
utility serving 4,000 customers in northeast Iowa.</p>

<p>Approximately $1,900, or 10%, of the average personal income of each
adult and child in the Midwest is spent on energy each year, and the majority
of this energy is imported. Iowa alone spends $5 billion annually on energy
imported from outside the state. These outlays are rising: since 1986,
WL&amp;P's energy sales have grown an average of 4.2% annually. In addition,
about 95% of the Midwest's current energy is supplied by coal and petroleum,
both of which contribute to acid rain and greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>The MWEP was formed to demonstrate that wind energy can help reduce
environmental costs while keeping energy dollars closer to home. To date,
the wind turbine has reduced carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) output by
119 tons and has generated more than 325,000 kilowatt-hours (KWH) as of
May 1996. The success of MWEP, as well as additional up-to-date information
about wind machines and wind energy, have been provided to utilities, farmers,
businesses and general consumers since the program's inception.</p>

<p>Following on the success of the MWEP, the Iowa Association of Municipal
Utilities has completed a study on the feasibility of developing a large,
commercial wind farm in northwest Iowa. As outlined in the study, the farm
would support 15 wind turbines, each with a generating capacity of 1.725
million kilowatt-hours annually. It is possible that the average delivered
cost of the wind farm power could be as low as about $.03 per kilowatt-hour.</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Economics</font></b></p>

<p><img src="mw_wmill.jpg" border=0 height=300 width=165 align=right></p>

<ul>
<li>Over the past decade, the cost of wind generation has dropped about
75%. Wind-generated power now costs about $.04 - $.06 per kilowatt-hour,
making it competitive with coal.</li>

<li>Waverly is located in a Class 3 wind regime (region), where average
wind velocity is about 11.8 miles per hour (MPH). Vast areas of the Midwest
and West, served by large utilities in primarily rural areas, have Class
3, 4 and 5 wind regimes, indicating that the MWEP could be replicated throughout
much of the United States, with even better economic results.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>The Turbine</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The 80 kilowatt wind turbine uses advanced airfoil blades and is installed
on a 140-foot tower to take advantage of the higher wind speeds present
at higher elevations.</li>

<li>According to the American Wind Energy Association, Iowa has such high
average winds that it could provide 20% of the electricity used in the
continental United States.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>WL&amp;P's Participation in the Global Climate Challenge</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>In addition to the MWEP, Waverly Light &amp; Power is engaged in numerous
activities as part of its participation in the Global Climate Challenge.
including planting 6,000 trees by the year 2000, installing high pressure
sodium municipal lights, promoting the use of electric vehicles and providing
heating, air conditioning and light rebates designed to encourage the purchase
of more efficient fixtures and appliances.</li>

St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church. Since receiving her certification,
Luster had been hoping to start a garden for the poor and hungry in Baltimore,
but was having little success finding an eligible partner. Hall, who understood
the importance of developing an environmental dimension to his inner-city
ministry, was looking for an environmental project in which to invest his
support. The two met, and shortly thereafter the Power of Hope Garden was
born.</p>

<p>To begin, Luster acquired several vacant lots in a particularly rundown
area of Baltimore's inner city through the city Adopt-A-Lot program. The
program enables individuals and groups to lease city abandoned lots at
no charge on a year-to-year basis, with the only requirement that the land
be kept free of debris. She mobilized the residents living in the adjacent
row houses to garden with her, and established a half-block long urban
garden. The garden has recently expanded to cover more than two city blocks.</p>

<p>Using organic mulch as fertilizer and employing the labor of local low-income
residents and homeless persons (some of whom are women and their children),
the garden is producing fresh peppers, tomatoes, beans, eggplant, cabbage,
cucumbers, okra and other produce to help stock the local food kitchens
and to feed local residents. Not only that, but the garden has wrought
changes in the neighborhood -- and the neighbors -- as well.</p>

<p>&quot;The folks from the neighborhood have started a street association,&quot;
says Luster. &quot;They are working on rehabbing the abandoned housing
that rings the garden. For the garden's opening ceremony, the street --
filled with broken glass and everything else -- was cleaned up. That was
a year ago, and it's stayed clean ever since.&quot;</p>

<p>The gardeners are learning organic gardening techniques, and they are
learning about themselves. &quot;We raise more than vegetables, we raise
people's self-esteem,&quot; says Luster. &quot;An eleven-year old boy who
works with me in the garden can now spell photosynthesis and explain the
process.&quot;</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Benefits of an Urban Garden</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The 5,000 vacant lots scattered throughout Baltimore can cost the city
up to $2,000 a year -- per lot -- to keep clean. Urban gardens dramatically
reduce the city's maintenance costs while beautifying and revitalizing
older neighborhoods.</li>

<li>Vacant, debris-littered lots are breeding grounds for rats and other
pests. Urban gardens remove the rats' habitat and reduce associated health
risks.</li>

<li>Property values around urban gardens rise as the neighborhood becomes
a more desirable place to live.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Future Plans</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The garden will soon introduce the concept of <a href="http://www.sustainable.doe.gov/cgi-bin/sdp/ra.pl?NCAT013485">community
supported agriculture</a>, in which neighbors and others share the costs
and risks of producing food by purchasing &quot;shares&quot; in the early
spring. The sharers commit to covering the agricultural costs up front,
and in exchange receive a bag of organically-grown, just-picked produce
every week during the growing season.</li>

<li>The program will soon adopt a composting program that will collect
kitchen wastes from households in the immediate vicinity. Surplus compost
may be offered to the public at very low cost.</li>

<li>Luster and Hall hope to establish a low-cost hydroponic greenhouse
for raising vegetables and flowers for the urban market all year. </li>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>The Preserve is a housing development located in Coral Gables (Florida)
that, through a cooperative effort between the City of Coral Gables and
the Pulte Home Corporation of Florida, has resulted in the preservation
of an Urban Wilderness Area and the development of affordable housing.</p>

<p>The area under consideration received its designation as an Urban Wilderness
Area from Broward County, a designation that is only conferred upon property
that is environmentally-sensitive and unique. However, prior to negotiations
between Pulte and the city, the area was slated to be developed into a
maximum of 165 single family homes, 112 townhomes and 16 duplex units --
a development strategy that would have maximized construction and, in all
likelihood, would have destroyed the wilderness area designation.</p>

<p>Pulte approached the city with a proposal: by making innovative use
of existing government regulations, the area could be resubdivided so that
housing density was reduced, more wilderness preserved, and a public park
created. Not only would the character of the wilderness area be preserved,
but by modifying the size of the lots, the cost of housing could be reduced
from about $250,000 per unit to about $130,000 per unit, helping to meet
the city's mandate to provide additional affordable housing.</p>

<p>This innovative arrangement has served the interests of all parties,
providing an economically-attractive development for Pulte while preserving
a valuable natural resource and providing low-cost housing for the residents
of Coral Gables.</p>

<center><p><img src="mrule.gif" alt=" " border=0 height=5 width=640></p></center>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Pulte was granted waivers from platting regulations in order to resubdivide
a multi-family parcel into quarter-acre lots, to allow the eradication
of existing single family lot lines, and to introduce affordable housing
in the area.</li>

<li>Pulte agreed to dedicate a 6.29-acre park to the public and to erect
an eight-foot fence around the park to enable the city to monitor who enters
the environmentally-sensitive area.</li>

<li>In order to preserve a significant number of the area's trees, Pulte
was faced with the expense of replacing and relocating numerous trees.
In order to offset this expense, Pulte was given credit for the appraised
value of the 6.29-acre park and the trees within it, maximizing Pulte's
ability to preserve woodland area.</li>

<li>Rare strap ferns were relocated to the park area to ensure their preservation.</li>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>The Sustainable City Project of the Urban Consortium Energy Task Force
develops urban planning processes that identify, rank and implement energy
policies and program options for promoting urban sustainability. Over the
course of the two-year project, the city of San Jose (California) and two
other cities used a common planning process to determine the needs, actions,
costs and resources necessary to integrate long-term energy planning into
the local policy-making framework.</p>

<p>Through its participation in the project, San Jose designed and implemented
an energy management program that sets a target to reduce energy use by
10% across all sectors by the year 2000. These reductions are to be achieved
through the incorporation of energy-efficient technologies (including solar
design features) in new construction and through the installation of high-efficiency
lighting in existing fixtures. In addition, San Jose has expanded its programs
in waste management and recycling, water conservation and pollution prevention.</p>

<p>Even before its participation in the Sustainable City Project began
in 1990, San Jose leaders had outlined critical public policy issues in
natural resource management in a report to the City Council entitled &quot;Toward
a Sustainable City.&quot; The report identified three guiding principles
of sustainability: that maintaining a healthy natural resource base was
critical to maintaining the health of the city's economy, that the maintenance
of a healthy environment would require the imposition of limits on human
development and that the earth, air, water and living biosphere are the
collective heritage of humanity and should be protected.</p>

<p>These principles have served to inform the efforts of the City of San
Jose in its participation in the Sustainable City Project, and in its policy
analysis regarding municipal energy systems, land use patterns, transportation
and water and waste systems.</p>

<center><p><img src="mrule.gif" alt=" " border=0 height=5 width=640></p></center>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Integrated Waste Management</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The &quot;Recycle Plus!&quot; program provides curbside pickup for
twelve types of recyclables. A volume-based fee scale for garbage collection
has been imposed. Multi-family units and mobile home parks now participate
in the program.</li>

<li>Through the city's &quot;Close the Loop&quot; program, the city purchases
30 different types of recycled products, provides incentives to encourage
the establishment of businesses that use recycled products in their processes,
and manages a grant program to conduct applied research on technical and
business barriers to the use of recyclables.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Energy Management</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>San Jose's Energy Management Program documented and assessed then-current
and projected energy use trends and energy conservation potentials across
all economic sectors. This research formed the basis of the City Council's
decision to adopt a long-term energy policy in 1989, the Sustainable City
Energy Strategy, that sets the target of a 10% energy use reduction across
all sectors by the year 2000. Some components of the energy strategy include:</li>

<ul>
<li>IDEAS (Innovative Design and Energy Analysis Service). The IDEAS publication
provides a comprehensive index to energy conservation design measures for
use by developers.</li>

<li>Participation in Pacific Gas &amp;&nbsp;Electric's PowerSaving Partners
Program. This energy efficiency program is designed to save the City of
San Jose $989,000 over nine years based on an initial investment of $345,000
in energy efficiency measures.</li>

<li>Solar Design Guidelines. The city has prepared residential guidelines
regarding the proper orientation of residential buildings to maximize solar
exposure.</li>
</ul>

<li>San Jose began replacing its 48,000 incandescent and mercury vapor
streetlights with more efficient low- and high-pressure sodium lights in
1981. The conversion was completed in 1984, and the city has saved $1.5
million and 270 billion Btu's (British thermal units) annually since.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Air Quality</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Building materials containing ozone-depleting agents have been banned.</li>

<li>Providers of air conditioning service are required to recycle the refrigerant.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Water Reclamation/Conservation</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>To protect the San Francisco Bay's saltwater habitat and ensure a reliable
supplemental water supply, San Jose will develop a NonPotable Reclamation
and Reuse Facility to provide water for turf and landscape areas at colleges,
schools, parks, cemeteries, medians, golf courses and irrigation of crops.
Additional potential uses include street sweeping, fire fighting, vehicle
washing and in decorative fountains.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The City Council adopted a goal of reducing wastewater flows by 12
million gallons per day. This goal will be accomplished by:</li>

<ul>
<li>Installing ultra-low-flow toilets (ULFT) in new construction. ULFT's
use 1 - 2 gallons of water per flush compared to the 4 - 7 gallons per
flush used by older toilets.</li>

<li>Financial incentives have been provided to local businesses to install
low-flow fixtures at their sites.</li>

the beauty of the 26-mile Gorge that it has been dubbed the &quot;little
Grand Canyon&quot; by some naturalists. In addition to its physical beauty,
ecologists have documented the Gorge as one of the most biologically diverse
places in the United States, containing numerous endangered plants and
animals.</p>

<p>Rather than lose portions of this pristine gorge to development, a group
of local citizens more than a decade ago began a campaign, based on the
Nature Conservancy model, to buy the 25,000 acres of land within the gorge
to ensure its preservation. To date, about half of the area has been preserved.</p>

<p>In addition to preservation, the Trust is dedicated to environmental
education and conveying the value of environmental stewardship. To this
end, the Trust has established the Pot Point facility, a scientific field
station. Here, students and the public are exposed to the beauty of the
area, and are taught about the value of the entire conservation movement.</p>

<p>Finally, as a result of working to preserve Chattanooga's natural beauty,
the city has enjoyed the benefit from businesses that have chosen to settle
in the area. On a recent visit to Chattanooga, Vice President Al Gore said,
&quot;While I'm sitting here with all these Fortune 500 companies, let
me tell you that any company looking for a place to locate that is deeply
committed to sustainable development...Chattanooga is the place to come.&quot;</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p><img src="ve_vlly.jpg" hspace=3 border=0 height=122 width=183 align=left>The
Vail Environmental Strategic Plan was adopted to maintain and improve environmental
quality in the Vail valley and to ensure the prolonged economic health
of the region. The plan is designed to achieve both goals through a series
of efforts to monitor and improve air and water quality, to preserve open
space and to protect the area's natural wildlife.</p>

<p>Vail's environment has gone through a dramatic transition from sheep
farming in the 1930's and 1940's to an internationally renowned ski resort.
Since the opening of the Vail ski resort in 1959, the rate of development
in Vail has been rapid. This rapid growth recently raised concern among
residents that more needed to be done to protect the area's natural environment,
particularly because the health of the local economy is tied directly to
the ability to offer visitors clean air, clean water and open space.</p>

<p>In 1993, 54 representatives from neighborhoods, businesses, developers,
recreationalists, special interest groups and governmental entities met
for two days to discuss how Vail could create a more environmentally and
economically sustainable community. From this conference and many more
public forums, the Vail Environmental Strategic Plan was created that now
provides a framework for sustainable development in the Vail valley.</p>

<p>The plan recognizes the link between environmental quality and economic
development and that a balance is needed between these two elements. It
also recognizes the need to ensure a healthy environment and economy for
future generations while protecting historical and cultural values in the
community.</p>

<p>The plan outlines actions designed to achieve four goals:</p>

<p><img src="ve_lift.jpg" hspace=3 border=0 height=185 width=121 align=right></p>

<ul>
<li><b>Sustainable land use regulation and economic development.</b> To
ensure that new development is consistent with the carrying capacity of
the area's natural environment and man-made resources and to provide information
to encourage community support for environmental quality.</li>

<li><b>Protection of the area's ecosystem. </b>To protect the area's natural
resources and recognizes that they are interdependent.</li>

<li><b>Increase environmental efficiency. </b>To improve efficiency in
water, energy and waste management in businesses, residences and in government.</li>

<li><b>Improve environmental management, compliance and promotion</b>.
To ensure environmental compliance through proactive environmental management.</li>
</ul>

<center><p><img src="mrule.gif" alt=" " border=0 height=5 width=640></p></center>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Air Quality</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Incentives have been provided to convert dirty-burning fireplaces to
cleaner-burning natural gas fireplaces.</li>

<li>The town and major employers are offering incentives to encourage residents
to commute by bus.</li>

<li>To address suspended particulate pollution, the town has switched from
applying sand to applying volcanic cinders to roads during the winter to
aid in traction. Cinders are less likely to become airborne than sand.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Water Quality</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>A study of water quality in the town's stream has led to the creation
of a Nonpoint Source Water Quality Plan designed to reduce storm water
runoff. An analysis conducted for the plan found that nutrient and sediment
concentrations had increased significantly during the last 10 years. To
help reverse this trend:</li>

<ul>
<li>An erosion control guideline manual and educational programs have been
developed for landscapers and home owners to reduce erosion and the application
of chemical fertilizers.</li>

<li>A U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) water quality and biological monitoring
station will be installed on Gore Creek.</li>

<li>A watershed management program, including habitat improvement projects
and the adoption of best management practices to reduce runoff, is being
developed.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Land Management</font></b></p>

<p><img src="ve_road.jpg" hspace=3 border=0 height=121 width=183 align=right></p>

<ul>
<li>A 48-acre parcel, slated for development as a residential subdivision,
was identified by the town and the National Heritage Program as a sensitive
wildlife habitat. A collective purchase agreement saved the parcel from
development.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Solid Waste</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The Vail Board of Realtors helped provide recycling containers in all
commercial areas.</li>

<li>The Division of Wildlife, the town and local trash haulers have provided
five bear-proof garbage cans to help raise awareness about the interaction
between human behavior and the environment.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Housing</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Housing costs in Vail are high; consequently, many of Vail's lower-income
employees, many of them Hispanic, are forced to live 30 to 60 miles away
from their work. Vail is currently working on a project that would provide
60 to 80 affordable housing units for employees in the town.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Environmental Monitoring</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The town and Vail Associates (the ski company) have created a program
of economic incentives/disincentives to ensure skier numbers do not exceed
the town's carrying capacity (e.g., sewage capacity, transportation network
and air quality).</li>

<li>The plan establishes a monitoring program that reviews air quality,
water quality, aquatic biological indicators, solid waste generation, energy
consumption, water usage, skier days and sales tax receipts to measure
the program's effectiveness.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="tj_gore.jpg" hspace=3 border=0 height=100 width=106 align=left>The
Thomas Jefferson Sustainability Council is one of ten components of the
Thomas Jefferson Study to Preserve and Assess the Regional Environment
(TJSPARE). The Council's three-year mission is to provide a definition
of sustainability for the small but rapidly urbanizing Charlottesville
region, to develop indicators to measure sustainability, and to determine
the risks to the region associated with any currently unsustainable actions
or policies. The ultimate goal is to develop a &quot;sustainability compact&quot;
among citizens, businesses, organizations and government in the region
to improve the sustainability of the economy, environment and human health.</p>

<p>TJSPARE, the parent initiative of the Council, is working to determine
the long-term capacity of the region's constructed and natural environments
to support planned development in the region. Both initiatives are projects
of the Thomas Jefferson Planning District Commission.</p>

<p>Central to the approach and success of the Council is its multi-stakeholder
process. The three-year program is bringing builders, developers, environmentalists,
social scientists, elected officials, teachers and many others together
to explore the definition of sustainability, indicators of sustainability
and the comparative risks of current and proposed development policies.
In particular, the process incorporates an environmental justice perspective,
ensuring that all disproportionate risks being borne by low-income communities
are identified. </p>

<p>Ultimately, the Council hopes to ensure ecological improvements by using
a market approach and appropriate technology to develop jobs and products
from the region while protecting significant habitat and other natural
resources.</p>

<p>The development of a more sustainable region will particularly benefit
low- and moderate-income residents who would be the least able to flee
to other parts of the state if the area becomes less livable.</p>

<p>The process is moving forward through a series of three regional forums
to develop actions, indicators and benchmarks and through 14 working groups,
each focusing on a separate topic identified by the Council as critical
to the process. To date, more than a year has been spent in consensus building
efforts among an incredibly diverse group of stakeholders.</p>

<center><p><img src="mrule.gif" alt=" " border=0 height=5 width=640></p></center>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The Council will hold three regional forums to develop actions, indicators
and benchmarks for assessing the regional carrying capacity. The Council
will measure such elements as waste reduction and the protection, restoration
and enhancement of natural resources.</li>

<li>The Council has convened 14 working groups to concentrate on 14 sustainability
topic areas.</li>

<li>The process will enable the community to establish &quot;desired ecological
states,&quot; and to outline a process for achieving these states.</li>

<li>An interdenominational roundtable is planned to reveal the religious
and ethical impediments to sustainability.</li>

<li>The Council has made extensive use of local expertise for presentations
on the various elements that build a sustainable community.</li>

<li>Hundreds of hours have been dedicated to thinking about the roots of
emerging long-term environmental and economic problems.</li>

distribution of 100,000 free ultra-low-flush toilets annually to households
throughout Southern California.</p>

<p>The goal of the program is to boost water conservation in low-income
communities where traditional toilet replacement programs have been less
effective. In such programs, water agencies provide their customers with
rebates to replace their old toilets; however, rebate programs leave out
low-income communities where money is too scarce for residents to invest
in a new toilet, particularly when rebate checks can take as long as 30
days to be issued.</p>

<p>Under the MWDSC Toilet Replacement Program, the MWDSC and local water
agencies provide funding through their conservation programs to CTSI Corporation,
which warehouses the toilets and recruits community-based organizations
(CBO's) to participate in the program. Once trained in marketing, customer
relations, data entry and inventory control, the participating CBO's make
the toilets available free of charge in surrounding communities. For each
toilet distributed, the CBO&nbsp;is paid a fixed fee (approximately $25)
that they can use to cover all costs and to help fund their own programs.</p>

<p>California consumes more than four million acre-feet of water a year,
with 66% of that consumption due to residential demand. (An acre-foot is
approximately 326,000 gallons of water, or enough to supply the needs of
two average families for one year.) Without a long-term commitment to water
conservation, Southern California's environmental and economic sustainability
are threatened. The toilet replacement program creates a reliable, low-cost
source for new water by replacing standard toilets using 3-7 gallons per
flush with new ultra-low-flow toilets (ULFTs) that only use 1.6 gallons
per flush.</p>

<p>With sustained drought periods throughout the West, and an ever-growing
regional population, it makes economic sense to the water customers, water
agencies and the State of California to support water conservation efforts
well into the future.</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Benefits to Community-Based Organizations Participating
in the Project:</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>First AME&nbsp;Church has created economic development programs such
as entrepreneur training and micro loans for small businesses.</li>

<li>Mothers of East Los Angeles has funded scholarship programs for local
high school students, tutorial programs and graffiti abatement programs.</li>

<li>In east Los Angeles, a community-based organization was able to qualify
for funding to start a child immunization program because of the experience
it developed participating in the program.</li>

<li>One group is helping to provide low-income housing and employment,
and the jobs generated by the program are credited by community leaders
with helping to defuse a gang war in 1994.</li>

<li>Other groups, such as high schools, senior citizen centers and the
Boy Scouts participate by assisting with one-time special events. They
are paid a fee for each toilet distributed, using money for special projects
or extracurricular activities that might otherwise go unfunded.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Environmental Benefits: </font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Old toilets are collected from consumers, stripped of metal and plastic
parts and crushed for use as road base, rather than being shipped off to
landfills.</li>

<li>The program provides a reliable source of new water at a time when
agreements to protect natural resources like Mono Lake, the Sacramento
River Bay-Delta region and other natural habitats are of great importance.</li>

<li>The cost of program is significantly less than the cost of developing
new supplies (e.g., building a dam) and is every bit as effective without
damaging the environment.</li>

<h2>Town of Dunn Land Use Plan and Open Space Preservation</h2>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>The Town of Dunn's innovative land use plan implements growth control
measures through zoning restrictions, lot size limits, conservation easements
and the purchase of development rights to preserve the town's rural integrity,
protect natural habitat, conserve resources, preserve open space and to
maintain farming as the town's primary economic activity.</p>

<p>Since the implementation of the land use plan in 1979, the town has
kept growth to a minimum while improving the health of local wetlands,
lakes and farmland. Residents meanwhile have continued to enjoy a high-quality
rural life and one of the lowest tax rates in the county.</p>

<p>The land use plan, implemented nearly two decades ago, came in response
to burgeoning and haphazard residential development that had begun to threaten
both the agricultural health of the town as well as the town's rural character.</p>

<p>A two-year moratorium on subdivision development was imposed and town
officials, residents, students and educators met collaboratively to develop
a land use plan consistent with their vision to maintain a healthy environment
and to preserve the town's heritage. The town was also interested in keeping
taxes down, and they knew residential development was the first step in
the wrong direction if that goal was to be met.</p>

<p>Studies show that residential development commonly costs more than agricultural
preservation. &quot;The rule of thumb is that development costs $1.25 for
every $1 of additional tax base,&quot; says Ed Minihan, Chairman of the
Town of Dunn. So much of the land use plan was written to discourage growth.</p>

<p>A comparison to the adjacent town of Fitchburg illustrates the economic
benefits afforded the Town of Dunn through its land use and open space
preservation programs. When both Fitchburg and Dunn were primarily rural
with approximately 4,500 residents each, the paths of the towns diverged.
Fitchburg chose to promote development, while Dunn chose to preserve its
rural character and agricultural base. Twenty years later, Fitchburg has
grown to 15,000 residents (an average increase of about 5% per year for
a total increase of 233%) and the services it has had to provide have grown,
too. So have the taxes that fund those services. The municipal tax on a
$100,000 property in Fitchburg is $505. </p>

<p>The Town of Dunn has grown to 5,400 residents (an average increase of
about .9% per year for a total increase of 20%). The municipal tax on a
$100,000 property in Dunn is $154, or 348% less than in Fitchburg.</p>

<p>In addition to keeping taxes low, the land use plan has served as the
springboard for protecting the local environment. The implementation of
conservation easements paved the way for community action to help protect
natural habitat, wetlands and watersheds. Most recently, by purchasing
development rights, the Town of Dunn is preserving environmentally-sensitive
areas from any future development.</p>

<p>Though enacted nearly two decades ago, the land use vision continues
to serve and receive the full support of town residents. &quot;Folks in
the town are smart enough to keep voting for people who favor the land
use plan,&quot; says Minihan. &quot;And the town has stuck to its plan.&quot;</p>

<center><p><img src="mrule.gif" alt=" " border=0 height=5 width=640></p></center>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The land use plan puts strict controls on land subdivision and lot
sizes, and prevents development in certain areas.</li>

<li>The plan mandates the use of traditional tools such as subdivision
control and erosion mitigation ordinances, conservation easements, and
exclusive agriculture, conservancy and recreation zoning.</li>

<ul>
<li>The implementation of exclusive agriculture zoning protects farmland
and open space.</li>

<li>Conservation easements work much better than zoning restrictions, because
they can be tailored to individual parcels. </li>
</ul>

<li>The town recently began purchasing development rights to permanently
protect farm and open space lands from development with help from citizen
contributions. The nature of this transaction will prevent the Town of
Dunn from selling the development rights to a future developer.</li>

<li>The establishment of a cooperative agreement with Dane County Parks
will enable the town to identify and map Native American burial grounds
and villages for preservation.</li>

<li>The town has created a land trust to permanently protect farmland and
environmentally sensitive areas.</li>

<li>The town has implemented cooperative wetlands restoration projects
involving both town and county agencies.</li>

<li>The plan creates mechanisms for citizen action, including town committees,
work crews and fundraisers.</li>

<li>ThetTown worked with University of Wisconsin students to inventory
Dunn's natural and cultural resources including wetlands, watersheds, wildlife
habitat areas, woodlots, historic sites and prime agricultural land. The
inventory was turned into a publication that serves as guidance for the
preservation of lakes, wetlands, forests and farmland for present and future
generations.</li>

<li>The plan set out the development of a recycling program in advance
of a county mandate.</li>

<li>The town has established spring community cleanups of roadsides and
environmentally- and culturally-sensitive areas.</li>

<li>Two major wetland restoration projects have been completed. Approximately
18 acres of damaged wetlands on the shores of Lake Waubesa were restored
to their original condition and now help serve as a habitat for Northern
Pike. A seven-acre parcel near Lake Kegonsa was improved with a water retension
pond.</li>

<li>The town has encouraged preservation of wetlands and woodlots of more
than 2,000 acres through purchases by the Department of Natural Resources
as part of the Hook Island/Grass Lake Preserve, and also the preservation
of 1,700 acres by the Dane County Parks Department as part of the Mud Lake
Protection Area.</li>

<li>Dunn's voluntary recycling program, enacted prior to a county recycling
mandate, in 1993 diverted 112 tons of recyclables from landfills.</li>

<li>Residents donated $50,000 to help defeat the proposed sighting of a
landfill on the shores of Lake Waubesa.</li>

<li>The Colladay Point Neighborhood Association purchased property from
developers to prevent the construction of a multi-family housing complex
on Lake Kegonsa.</li>

<li>The programs have reduced the need for landfill space and have increased
awareness of sustainability among residents.</li>

<li>All remaining Native American burial mounds and villages are protected
from development.</li>

<li>The Burying Ground has been restored and expanded.</li>

<li>Each year the town gives an award to a community member for outstanding
work in the area of natural resource preservation. Past awards have been
given for the donation of conservation easements for farm and wetlands,
agriculture conservation practices and fish habitat restoration.</li>

<li>The unique grassroots approach for administering the land use plan
has resulted in open dialogue and cooperation among citizens, government
officials, conservation agencies and university affiliates. </li>

<p>The Mothers of East Los Angeles - Santa Isabel's (MELA-IS) Ultra Low
Flush Toilet Program Water Conservation Team employs local area students
to identify eligible residents in low-income neighborhoods and to help
install free ultra-low-flush toilets (ULFT's) in these residents' homes.</p>

<p><img src="ul_tlt1.jpg" border=0 height=160 width=174 align=right>Through
a unique partnership between the local water agency and MELA-IS, MELA-IS
receives a $25 rebate for every ULFT they install. A portion of the money
that MELA-IS earns through the rebates pays the full cost of installing
the toilets and excess revenue is used by MELA-IS&nbsp;to fund its own
community development programs, which include a lead poison prevention
project and a literacy campaign. Recipients of the new ultra-low-flush
toilets return their old toilets to the water agency to be crushed and
used in road gravel.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.sustainable.doe.gov/cgi-bin/sdp/ra.pl?NCAT011697">toilet
replacement program</a> was pioneered in 1992 by MELA-IS in cooperation
the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWDSC). The initial
pilot program had a goal of installing 1,000 ULFT's over eight weeks. Due
to the overwhelming success of the pilot program, by 1994 numerous community-based
organizations in addition to MELA-IS had joined the program and the program
now installs approximately 100,000 toilets a year. </p>

<p>According to the MWDSC, the average person uses 135 gallons of water
a day, and the average household uses 163,000 gallons -- or about half
an acre-foot -- per year. (One acre foot is the amount of water that would
cover an acre of land to a depth of one foot, or about 326,000 gallons.)
</p>

<p><img src="ul_cnco1.jpg" hspace=4 border=1 height=165 width=210 align=left>Several
years ago, in an attempt to reduce water consumption (it is less expensive
to conserve water than to locate new water sources), the MWDSC introduced
a toilet replacement program, but the program returned poor participation
rates. In 1992, MELA-IS met with the MWDSC and other water utilities to
explain that low-income residents couldn't afford to pay $100 for a new
toilet and wait 30 days for a rebate check. MELA-IS outlined an alternative
strategy and the pilot project was born.</p>

<p>&quot;It is very gratifying to participate in a program where everyone
ends up winning,&quot; says Angel Echevarria, Board of Water and Power
Commissioners member. &quot;The community wins by having toilets installed
in their homes that will save them water and money, and the water industry
wins by gaining a broader base of permanent water savings in the community.&quot;</p>

<p>Community-based organizations, like MELA-IS, win, too, by employing
community members to install the toilets, and by receiving funding for
their community outreach programs.</p>

<p>&quot;This program is providing employment for people who were unemployed.
It's providing health insurance for people who wouldn't otherwise have
it, and it's bringing water conservation to areas that would otherwise
be excluded,&quot; says Keith Watkins, program director for the California
Department of Water Resources. &quot;We now have a bridge between water
agencies and communities that was never there before.&quot;</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>How the Program Works</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The MWDSC and local water agencies provide funding through their conservation
programs to CTSI Corporation, which warehouses the toilets and recruits
community-based organizations (CBO's) to participate in the program. Once
trained in marketing, customer relations, data entry and inventory control,
the participating CBO's make the toilets available free of charge in surrounding
communities. For each toilet distributed, the CBO&nbsp;is paid a fixed
fee (approximately $25) that they can use to cover all costs and to help
fund their own programs. Toilet recipients return their old toilets to
be ground up and used in road gravel.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>MELA-IS Programs Funded through the Toilet Replacement
Program:</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>MELA-SI has been able to create an immunization program in which children
up to 18 years of age receive free immunizations and physicals.</li>

<li>The Child Lead Poison Prevention program in which students go door
to door to make community members aware of the possibility that they may
have lead in their homes, and to refer residents for free lead testing
at nearby county facilities.</li>

<li>A graffiti abatement program that hires high school students to remove
graffiti and paint murals.</li>

<li>A tutoring program that provides academic tutoring and self-esteem
classes to improve high school graduation rates in low-income communities.</li>

<li>A&nbsp;one-time donation of $2,000 to buy diapers, baby food and water
for earthquake victims.</li>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>Village Homes is a 68-acre development of single-family homes, apartments,
a community center and an office building that features solar construction,
natural cooling systems, communal agricultural areas, a natural drainage
system and a pedestrian- and bike-friendly layout.</p>

<p>The concept for Village Homes originated with Mike and Judy Corbett
in 1973 as a way to offer homeowners and apartment dwellers a greater sense
of community and a more ecologically-sound lifestyle than offered by traditional
housing developments. The project serves as a model for environmentally
sustainable development and community planning.</p>

<p>One of the development's most attractive features is its emphasis on
fostering a sense of community among the residents. The development features
a swimming pool and a large field for soccer and baseball. In addition
to drawing residents together, these amenities obviate the need to drive
elsewhere for recreation.</p>

<p>Community green spaces and shared gardens bring neighbors together during
the evenings and on weekends. During the spring and summer, residents are
likely to put out a red &quot;pot luck&quot; flag, inviting neighbors to
come out of their homes with various dishes and sit on the lawn, picnic-style
for dinner and socializing. </p>

<p>There are more walking and bicycle paths than roads, which lend themselves
to evening strolls, toddler bicycle training, roller skating and lemonade
stands. The innate pedestrian safety enables parents to allow their children
nearly free reign within Village Homes, encouraging the children to form
congenial bands of playmates who benefit from receiving oversight from
numerous community members.</p>

<p>Residents control future development themselves through the homeowners'
association. With 25% of the land area in the development dedicated to
open space, recreational facilities and agriculture, the development has
produced some income-generating enterprises, including an almond orchard
that borders the property. The homeowners' association's equity in these
properties will eventually produce enough collateral to allow the neighborhood
to build more offices, a delicatessen and an exercise studio.</p>

<center><p><img src="mrule.gif" alt=" " border=0 height=5 width=640></p></center>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Layout</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>There are 220 single-family homes and 20 apartments. Sizes range from
3,000 square feet to a cluster of 600-foot units that share a community
area. A co-op house accommodates a dozen people in a nine-bedroom house.</li>

<li>The development is designed to make it easier to visit between houses
by walking or biking. All streets end in cul-de-sacs and most streets have
pedestrian connections.</li>

<li>Street are narrow (20 to 25 feet instead of the common 30 feet or more)
to absorb less heat in the summer.</li>

<li>Building setbacks are 15 feet, to enable enough room for greenways.</li>

<li>Bikeways form a grid across the subdivisions, making biking or walking
the most direct and quickest way to travel. The bikeway system ties into
the bikeways of the University of California at Davis.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Land Use</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Twelve acres are set aside for community agriculture including orchards
and vineyards.</li>

<li>Smaller, 1/3-acre parcels are owned and used in common by each group
of eight families for community gardens and play areas.</li>

<li>One large field offers space for soccer and baseball games, and a smaller
play field is available for community gatherings.</li>

<li>Twenty-four percent of the produce consumed by Village Homes residents
is grown within the development.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Energy Conservation</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>All homes are well-insulated and incorporate passive solar construction.</li>

<li>All homes have rooftop solar water heaters that meet 100% of a home's
hot water needs in the summer and 50% in the winter.</li>

<li>Most residents are living comfortably without air conditioners.</li>

<li>Every conceivable type of solar house has been built in the development
from passive solar cottages to sophisticated, active solar designs using
water or air as heat storage medium.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Water Conservation</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>All water runoff is channeled by stream to natural sand pockets instead
of being carried away by culverts. This system ensures that water penetrates
into the ground on site to provide a high water level for vegetation.</li>

<li>The development utilizes xeriscaping, which is the cultivation of drought-tolerant
plants to minimize water use.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Community Amenities</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>A child care cooperative provides &quot;no-cost&quot; child care. </li>

<li>Community members may pick the fruit and nut crops without charge.</li>

<li>Fenced backyards have been replaced by common areas.</li>

<li>The average walking time to the local grocery store is 10 minutes.</li>

of Success:</b></p>
</dl>

<dl>
<dl>
<dl>
<li>The homes in the Village Homes development are 50%&nbsp;more energy
efficient than surrounding homes.</li>

<li>A 1990 study found that Village Homes residents use 36% less energy
for vehicular driving, 47% less electricity and 31% less natural gas per
household than a conventional neighborhood control group.</li>

<li>Tree-lined streets keep the temperature about 10% cooler than surrounding
neighborhoods.</li>

<li>Open space accounts for 25% of the land in the development.</li>

<li>Village Homes residents know 50%&nbsp;more of their neighbors than
do residents in nearby developments.</li>

<li>Initially, Village Homes sold for the same price as others in Davis.
On average, they now sell for $11 per square foot more.</li>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p><img src="ws_aero.jpg" border=0 height=150 width=262 align=right>The
Walnut Street Bridge Restoration &amp; Riverwalk Extension project is a
downtown revitalization project in Chattanooga that has saved Chattanooga's
historic Walnut Bridge from demolition and has restored -- using trend
setting environmental protection techniques -- the city's abandoned downtown
waterfront area. The bridge, which previously carried vehicular traffic,
has been turned into a 24-hour linear park over the Tennessee River for
runners, walkers, cyclists, roller bladers and pedestrian commuters. On
the south shore, what was once undevelopable highway fill has been replaced
by a boardwalk and a languishing lot underneath the highway viaduct has
been converted to a covered amphitheater.</p>

<p>By permitting only electric buses and horsedrawn carriages on the bridge,
and by linking the bridge to a pedestrian-centered, revitalized downtown,
the project has reduced automobile traffic and pollution while providing
an attractive, safe outdoor development for the residents of Chattanooga.</p>

<p><img src="ws_hstr1.jpg" hspace=6 border=0 height=135 width=189 align=left>In
1978, the State of Tennessee closed the old Walnut Street Bridge because
it was no longer deemed safe for passage. Dating to 1891 and considered
too expensive to fix, the state intended to construct a new span in its
place. A group of concerned citizens, however, halted demolition when they
succeeded in having the bridge listed as eligible for the National Register
of Historic Places.</p>

<p>For nearly ten years the fate of the bridge remained unresolved until,
in 1987, a task force of nonprofit organizations offered a comprehensive
strategy for bridge restoration and downtown renewal. Through a series
of well-coordinated letter writing campaigns, massive fireworks displays
over the bridge, history museum exhibits, television and talk show events
and presentations to the city commission, the bridge restoration committee
built a broad consensus to utilize environmentally-sensitive techniques
to preserve the bridge, revitalize the downtown area and offer unprecedented
pedestrian access to the area.</p>

<p>During revitalization and construction, environmental preservation efforts
included incorporating salvaged and recycled materials into construction,
and the adoption of a lead-based paint removal process that protected the
environment from potentially serious lead contamination.</p>

<p>&quot;Many cities improve their downtowns by tearing down the old and
putting up the new, but here in Chattanooga, we approach it a little differently,&quot;
says Congressional Representative Marilyn Lloyd.</p>

<p>Completed in 1993, the project has proven to be an economic boon to
the city. Where once the city was faced with the uncertainty of an unsafe,
abandoned bridge and deserted waterfront area, the city now enjoys an environmentally-friendly
urban renewal zone that emphasizes pedestrian access over automobile traffic
and offers new restaurants, shops and galleries.</p>

<ul>
<li>By using steel grit as a blasting material to remove old lead-based
paint instead of hundreds of tons of silica sand, the traditional material
for such work, cleanup of the stripped paint was far easier. Unlike silica
sand, which becomes inextricably bound to the paint, the steel grit could
be recovered, dramatically reducing the amount of toxic waste material
generated by the process. By reusing the steel grit in airtight containment
structures, the lead paint was prevented from migrating into the water
system. This was the first time such a process was used in the State of
Tennessee.</li>

<li>The decision to salvage and recycle old materials was made during the
design process. Hundreds of tons of historic cut limestone were reused
in new retaining walls and decorative exterior stairs very much in keeping
with the historic character of the bridge's limestone piers, and historic
wrought iron was reused during construction.</li>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p><img src="wt_hse50.jpg" border=0 height=135 width=201 align=right></p>

<p>The Wampanoag Tribal Multi-Purpose Building serves as an administrative,
educational and social center for the Wampanoag tribe, which has inhabited
Martha's Vineyard for hundreds of years. The structure features environmentally-sound
technologies including passive solar construction, high-efficiency lighting,
salvaged and recycled construction materials and resource-efficient plumbing
and water fixtures. </p>

<p>In constructing its first community structure in hundreds of years,
the Wampanoag tribe determined that two priorities should drive the building's
design: the structure should be built in harmony with the environment,
and it should exact minimum environmental impact over its lifetime.</p>

<p>&quot;As Native Americans, we have always been environmentally sensitive,&quot;
says tribal chairwoman Beverly Wright, &quot;and we wanted our tribal headquarters
to reflect that.&quot;</p>

<p>To achieve their goals, the Wampanoag tribe engaged in a collaborative
process involving the design team, the building committee, tribal office
staff, the tribal Council and tribal members. Rather than using a general
contractor, construction was undertaken by a construction superintendent
retained directly by the tribe. In this way, collaborative and integrated
construction was assured.</p>

<p>Completed in 1994, the headquarters serves as a gathering place for
the tribe, and reflects the traditional Native American values of respect
for, and interdependence with, nature.</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Energy Efficiency Features</font></b></p>

<ul>
<p><b>Lighting/Passive Solar</b></p>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The building has been constructed on a hilltop, just below the hill's
horizon line, preserving as much as possible the beauty of the site while
maximizing the building's exposure to the sun and minimizing exposure to
the fierce weather patterns of Martha's Vineyard.</li>

<li>A scale model of the building was constructed to help maximize the
percentage of lighting provided by daylight. Windows and skylights are
placed for maximum exposure, transom glazes help distribute light and a
controller system helps dim the electric lighting in response to rising
daylight levels.</li>

<li>The building is elongated on an east-west axis with 65% of the building's
glass located on the south facade.</li>

<li>Glazed glass used in the south-side windows admits more solar energy
than normal low-e glass. The glass used in the building's remaining windows
excludes solar heat while admitting visible light, helping to keep the
building cool during the summer.</li>

<p><b>Temperature Control</b></p>

<li>Airtight construction was verified with a blower door test so that
key leakage areas could be resealed.</li>

<li>A ventilation system that provides heat recovery from exhaust air provides
excellent indoor air quality with minimum energy use penalty.</li>

<li>A heat recovery system uses exhaust air from the composting toilet
system to provide hot water.</li>

<li>The building has no air conditioning. Cooling is provided by opening
windows.</li>

<p><b>Water Use</b></p>

<li>Water use is minimized with high-efficiency fixtures and the installation
of waterless, composting toilets.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.sustainable.doe.gov/cgi-bin/sdp/ra.pl?NCAT011711">A
composting toilet and graywater system</a> are used to minimize water use,
waste and pollution. The waterless, composting toilet converts waste into
composted fertilizer that is collected for use by a local farmer. The graywater
system uses a filtering system and a trough containing flowers and plants
to filter water from interior fixtures and appliances (i.e., showers, sinks,

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Description</font></b></p>

<p>The Yolo County Resource Conservation District (YCRCD) develops cooperative
relationships with farmers and other landowners to develop and implement
sustainable resource management initiatives. The YCRCD believes that such
initiatives, which include the protection of biodiversity, do not compete
with economic development but, rather, serve to ensure it. By working with
self-motivated, local stakeholders, the YCRCD helps landowners develop
effective, long-term models of stewardship.</p>

<p>The YCRCD&nbsp;is working to reverse the intertwined set of problems
produced in Yolo County through 40 years of intensive, conventional agricultural
practices: flooding, erosion, sediment deposition, nutrient and pesticide
runoff, impaired water quality, reduced groundwater recharge, increasing
energy costs and reduced biodiversity and wildlife.</p>

<p><img src="yc_brds.jpg" border=0 height=121 width=180 align=right>Through
conservation, efficiency and restoration projects, some of these trends
are being reversed. In partnership with landowners, the YCRCD has helped
implement numerous stewardship initiatives, including the development of
irrigation runoff ponds to conserve water, trap sediment, filter nutrients
and add to underground recharge rates; the cultivation of cover crops and
hedgerows to harbor beneficial insects, thus reducing harmful pests; the
development water management systems that provide the right amount of water
at the right time, reducing pumping costs and devising crop rotation cycles
that increase productivity and encourage the reproduction of helpful predators
that thrive in self-sustaining, low maintenance habitat zones.</p>

<p>&quot;The success of our stewardship initiatives means figuring what
our neighbors really want and will support without external pressure,&quot;
says Katy Pye, YCRCD's Executive Director. &quot;Outreach thus drives every
project.&quot;</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+2>Program Highlights</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Major Initiatives</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The Model Farm project is investigating numerous sustainable agriculture
practices to determine which of the practices work on which specific farms
and at what benefit to cost ratio.</li>

<li>A two-year farmscaping program uses irrigation tailwater return ponds
and native grassland systems on riparian habitat corridors to help reduce
pollution.</li>

<li>A Wildlife Workshop/Outreach program teaches local landowners, farmers
and ranchers to become conservation stewards on their own land.</li>

<li>An integrated Resource Assessment of a major western Yolo County watershed
is helping to define a long-term, community-based restoration strategy.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Additional Projects</font></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The Integrated Resource Management Plan for the 131,000-acre Westside
Tributaries Area uses ponds and reservoirs to increase groundwater recharge
rates, create wetlands and control downstream flooding.</li>

<li>The YCRCD rents a rice roller that crushes and incorporates rice stubble
into the soil, thus transforming the harvested fields into winter wetlands
for Pacific waterfowl.</li>

<li>The YCRCD offers a tree planting program to provide shade, save energy
and protect buildings from hot summer sun at migrant workers' housing centers.</li>

<li>The YCRCD has formed an alliance with a highly successful local school
program that employs &quot;at-risk&quot; students in riparian restoration.</li>

<li>The YCRCD has created a model arboretum for an outdoor classroom at
a local grammar school.</li>

<li>The YCRCD is cooperating with DQU, a Native American community college,
to restore on-campus wetlands.</li>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="/rsc/mrule.gif"></CENTER>
<P>
</P>
<P>      Building sustainable communities requires that local citizens make
decisions on a variety of practical issues, including open space access,
building quality, energy performance, land-use patterns and many others. Once
these difficult decisions are made, communities must codify many of them in
codes, ordinances, policy statements and other legal tools.       
</P>
<P>We are gathering the codes, ordinances, and policy statements developed by
communities that are already implementing sustainable development programs. They
are produced here verbatim so they can serve as models, if not actual text, for
other communities whose sustainable development initiatives are just beginning.</P>

<title>Introduction</title>

<!--**head**-->
<H2>Introduction</H2>

<p><IMG  SRC="/rsc/mrule.gif"><p>
<blockquote>
Only when our electricity is gone do we realize our
dependence on it.  Without electric power, businesses
are forced to close, incurring huge losses for
themselves and their utility, communications and
insurance companies.  Government agencies and
institutions become paralyzed; household activity stops;
traffic lights fail; health and safety are jeopardized.
<p>
This paper is an introduction to the concept of using
on-site renewable energy systems to mitigate the
crippling impact of power outages.  Solar, wind, and
hydroelectric systems can provide enough power to meet
the basic needs of homes, businesses, and government
agencies.  Biomass can also be used to generate
electricity or as an emergency fuel source for heating
and cooking.     
<p>
Because natural disasters such as hurricanes,
earthquakes, and floods commonly cause utility grid
failures, particular attention is paid in this booklet
to energy issues associated with these disaster types. 
It's important to acknowledge, however, that natural
disasters are by no means the only causes of power
outages.  Because it is so highly centralized and
complex, the utility grid is inherently vulnerable to
disruptions.  Reliance on sophisticated mega plants and
high-capacity transmission lines means that when outages
occur, they often affect a correspondingly large
geographical area.  Back-up renewable power systems can
serve as insurance against collapse of electrical
systems.  When installed in businesses, they can prevent
-- or at least reduce -- business interruption losses
caused by grid failure.
<p>
Two types of renewable energy systems are discussed in
this document:  fixed and portable.  Fixed systems tap
the renewable resource most appropriate for specific
locations, be it solar, wind, hydro, or biomass.  These
systems function all the time --supplementing utility
power during normal times and providing back-up power
during outages.
<p>
Portable systems, on the other hand, are deployed
following disasters to assist response crews and
victims.  Solar electricity or photovoltaics (PV) is the
most appropriate renewable energy source for these
applications because the systems are relatively easy to
transport and solar energy is plentiful in many regions.
<p>

Now, at the close of the most active hurricane season in
60 years, both PV and solar water heating companies are
experiencing a dramatic increase in business, according
to Scott Sklar, executive director of the Solar Energy
Industries Association. Solar system dealers in Florida
are particularly busy with shipments to the U.S. Virgin
Islands and the surrounding Caribbean region.   Sklar
said that natural disasters regularly boost demand for
solar products. 
PV systems have provided emergency power in the
aftermath of many past disasters:
<ul>
<li>  Northridge Earthquake, 1994:  PV kept some
communications links operating and supplied power to
Southern California residents that had installed systems
in their homes.
<p>
<li>  Hurricane Andrew, 1992:  PV systems were used at
shelters and medical clinics and to power street lights
and communications systems. 
<p>
<li>  Hurricane Hugo, 1989:  A portable solar electric
generator powered a community center for six weeks
following the storm.  
</ul>
A key benefit of solar systems for emergency use is
their self-sufficiency.  They require no fuel and very
little maintenance; yet they provide reliable power for
as long as needed.  The availability of fuel supplies is
a constant worry to those who rely on
fossil-fuel-powered generators during an emergency.  Not
only do renewable energy systems eliminate that worry,
but they also work without producing the overbearing
noise and noxious fumes that accompany gasoline and
diesel generators.
<p>
Fossil-fuel-powered generators are, however,
indispensable pieces of equipment for meeting
large-scale emergency power needs in such places as
sewer and water facilities, hospitals, and emergency
operations centers.  These locations often require
several hundred kilowatts (kW) of emergency power. 
Portable PV systems are most well-suited for meeting
smaller-scale needs requiring a few kW or less.
<p>
<H3>What's to Come</H3>
<p>
This paper first discusses how renewable energy systems
can prevent power outages by continuing to operate even
when the utility grid fails.  It then touches on how the
overall resilience of the nation's electricity system
can be improved by increased numbers of distributed
power generating facilities --including renewable energy
systems.  The third section explores one consequence of
power failures -- costly business interruption losses. 
It's followed by a section discussing new opportunities
for fixed renewable systems -- choices that have become
available just recently.  
<p>
By looking at three specific disasters, the fifth
section of this booklet explores energy-related issues
pertaining to various disaster types.  The final part
focuses on the emergency response arena and discusses
specific energy needs that can effectively be met with
solar systems.  Many of the potential uses for PV listed
here could be applied to meet day-to-day energy needs as
well.

<H2>Preventing Power Outages</H2>

<p><IMG  SRC="/rsc/mrule.gif"><p>
<blockquote>
Because they can be designed to continue working even
when the utility grid fails, renewable energy systems
can actually prevent power outages -- keeping homes and
businesses functioning during black-outs, or amid the
chaos following natural disasters.
<p>
A recent example of this benefit involves the Harmony
resort facility at Maho Bay Campground on St. John, one
of the U.S. Virgin Islands.  In mid-September, Hurricane
Marilyn swept 115 mile-per-hour winds across the island,
tearing roofs off buildings and knocking out electricity
and phone service.  The recycled building materials used
to construct the Harmony facility survived the winds, as
did its PV systems.  According to Stanley Selengut,
president of Maho Bay Camps, Inc., the systems' battery
banks never faltered and were once again replenished by
the solar panels when the storm passed and sun
reappeared. Campground staff remained at Harmony during
the hurricane period and were among the few Virgin
Islanders who had light, refrigeration, hot showers,
flush toilets, and the ability to communicate with the
outside world. 
<p>
The above example demonstrates that the use of quality
construction techniques and materials, coupled with the
installation of resilient, renewable power systems, can
help to ensure the continued health and safety of
disaster victims. Upfront investment in these
technologies can also significantly shorten the disaster
recovery process, cutting costly business interruption
losses.  The entire Maho Bay Campground complex is
slated to reopen in early November -- less than two
months after the hurricane.
<p>
Other disaster-prone regions can benefit from the
Harmony example by striving to replicate its
disaster-resistant design techniques at every
opportunity.  Resilient building technologies and
self-sufficient power systems should be employed
whenever possible in all new development in
disaster-prone areas -- both in construction projects
underway during disaster recovery and also in new
development undertaken during the normal course of
growth. Many of the best building technologies on the
market today are most economical in new construction;
thus, rebuilding presents an opportunity to greatly
improve the health, safety, and economy of individual
buildings and even entire communities.  
<p>
And although it may be initially more expensive to
invest in disaster-resistant technologies, taking such
precautions will ultimately prove to be much more
cost-effective than repeatedly rebuilding following
hurricanes, for example.  It's important that
cost-benefit analyses incorporate not only first costs,
but encompass the long-term big picture.  In the case of
self-sufficient renewable energy systems,
business-owners and community leaders must go beyond the
simple comparison between the cost of conventional
electricity and that of a solar, wind, or hydro system.
Life cycle costs must also be taken into account --
including the probability of personal and business
disruption losses caused by interruption of energy
services during and after disasters.  The renewable
energy system's ability to prevent those losses must
become part of the "benefit" calculation for resilient
power systems.

<title>Adding Resilience to the Utility Grid</title>

<H2>Adding Resilience to the Utility Grid</H2>

<p><IMG  SRC="/rsc/mrule.gif"><p>
<blockquote>
Besides bringing energy self-sufficiency to individual
buildings, distributed, renewable energy systems can
also improve the overall resilience of the nation's
utility grid.  The grid is one of the most reliable
systems in the world, but it is prone to failures and
glitches.  
<p>
In their book, <I>Brittle Power</I>, Amory B. and L. Hunter
Lovins discuss at length just how vulnerable the entire
U.S. energy system is to serious disruption and what
impact this vulnerability has on national security. 
Some of their ideas are discussed below, and the book is
cited in Appendix Two for further information on this
subject.
<p>
The Lovinses contend that the highly centralized nature
of the system makes it inherently "brittle," or easily
broken by unpredictable disruptions.  In contrast, an
energy system made up of small, distributed energy
stations is more resilient by nature, able to absorb
minor errors and problems.  
<p>
Centralized systems demand precision and leave little
room for error or disruption.  The entire electricity
grid, for example, is maintained at constant
synchronicity, with alternating current continually
flowing back and forth at a rate of 60 cycles per
second.  Even slight deviations from this pattern can
damage equipment and sometimes lead to outages.
<p>
Maintaining this precision over vast distances, with
huge amounts of energy concentrated at relatively few
locations, is challenging, at best.  Malicious attacks
on or accidental malfunctions at key power plants,
substations, transmission lines, or computer control
centers could black out entire regions in one fell swoop
and leave them without power for extended periods of
time.  Even weather extremes such as this past summer's
heat wave in Chicago can disrupt electrical service as
it did there, when transformer problems and a substation
fire caused 41,000 Commonwealth Edison customers to lose
power when they needed it most.  
<p>
If the nation's electricity system was more
decentralized, the impacts of weather, natural disaster,
sabotage, equipment failure or human error wouldn't be
nearly as catastrophic.  If smaller systems fail, fewer
people are affected.
<p>
The electric utility industry is moving toward
decentralization and distributed generation.  As the
basic structure of the industry changes due to impending
deregulation, smaller electricity generating sites
located closer to customers may become more common.  The
grid will continue to function as an electricity
"freeway," though energy is likely to come from many
more producers and may not be traveling such vast
distances.  
<p>
In addition to decreasing the overall vulnerability of
the electricity system, greater reliance on distributed
power will save millions of dollars in transmission and
distribution costs. A 1994 conference paper by the
engineering firm Black & Veatch stated that new
transmission lines can cost over one million dollars per
mile.  The paper also reported that U.S. utilities spent
close to $16 billion on transmission and distribution
improvements in 1993.  Locating power generating
stations closer to the loads they'll be serving will
reduce future transmission and distribution
expenditures.
<p>
Southern California Edison's Solar Neighborhood Program
is one current example of utility-scale distributed
generation.  The utility has installed PV generating
stations on rooftops in residential neighborhoods where
older, underground power lines are nearing overload
capacity and threatening to fail.  Over the years,
telephone and other utility liens have been installed on
top of the power lines, making it very expensive for the
utility to replace or repair its old cable.  Using local
solar power to "shave" the load on those lines allows
Southern Cal to indefinitely defer costly, disruptive
line replacement projects. 
In this situation, the greatest stress on the lines
occurs on summer afternoons when demand for air
conditioning is at its peak.  Tapping into the sun's
power when it's at its peak makes PV a perfect match. 
On cloudy days when the PV panels don't produce as much
energy, it isn't needed anyway.
<p>
The program started with the pilot installation of 15 kW
on the roof of an elementary school in South Pasadena. 
Its success has led to plans to install up to 115 kW at
that location, with additional arrays to be placed on
the rooftops of individual homes in the neighborhood. 
About 500 kW of supplementary solar electricity is the
program's goal.  Another school in La Canada and a
library in San Marino are two more potential PV sites.
<p>
The Sacramento Municipal Utility District is encouraging
its customers to supplement grid power with locally
produced solar electricity.  Its "Give Us Your Roofs"
program has resulted in the installation of more than
100 small PV units on private buildings in its service
area.  
<p>
The majority of these grid-connected PV applications
aren't designed to provide emergency back-up power. 
They go down when the grid goes down.  They do increase
the resilience of the grid system, however, and it will
be possible to add the controls and battery back-up that
will enable the systems to function independently of the
grid during emergencies in the future.

<title>The High Cost of Business Interruption</title> 

<b><a href="/pubs/emgpower/index.html">Nature's Power on Demand</a></b><br>
<i>US Department of Energy</i>

<!--**head**-->
<H2>The High Cost of Business Interruption</H2> 

<p><IMG  SRC="/rsc/mrule.gif"><p>
<blockquote>
One major impetus for preventing power outages and
bolstering the resilience of the nation's electrical
system can be described in three words:  business
interruption losses.  These are the additional costs
incurred when natural disasters or utility black-outs
force companies to cease operation and close stores,
restaurants, offices, and factories.
<p>
A recent University of Southern California (USC) study
estimated business interruption losses from the
Northridge Earthquake to be $5.945 billion.  The Great
Flood of 1993 in the Midwest caused business
interruption losses of $200-$500 million in Des Moines,
Iowa, alone.  
<p>
The interruption of one business can launch a chain
reaction by also disrupting those companies that supply
it with materials or equipment and those that in turn
depend on it for their materials or supplies.  For
example, some U.S. facilities of The Boeing Company and
Apple Computer, Inc. suffered production losses of up to
six weeks following the January 1995 earthquake in Kobe,
Japan.  They could not operate without needed supplies
from Kobe.
<p>
Some companies insulate themselves from damage occurring
anywhere along their particular "chain" by procuring
contingent business interruption insurance.  These
insured business interruption losses can sometimes be up
to four times greater than property damage claims
following a severe disaster.
<p>
Only about one-third of the Northridge losses stemmed
from direct business interruption within the
geographical areas physically impacted by earthquake;
the rest were contingent losses, felt throughout the
region, the nation, and the world, since Southern
California is an active participant in the global
economy.
<p>
USC's survey of the Northridge business community turned
up the following three main causes of direct business
interruption:  1) employees unable to get to work; 2)
employees attending to personal matters; and 3) damaged
workplace.  More than 70 percent of the 389 firms
surveyed mentioned these reasons.  Reason #4, given by
more than 60 percent of the companies, was interrupted
utility services.
<p>
Staff at the University of Delaware's Disaster Research
Center have also documented the business community's
reliance on electricity, as part of a larger effort to
understand the indirect impacts of natural disasters on
businesses.  More than 1,800 large and small businesses
representing five major business sectors participated in
two surveys to determine which lifeline services are
most important to business functioning: electricity,
telephone, natural gas, or water.  Results from both
surveys -- one in the Memphis, Tenn., area and the other
in Des Moines, Iowa -- indicate that electricity is the
most critical lifeline for businesses, and telephone
service is second. 
(Memphis businesses were surveyed because the area could
experience an earthquake of magnitude 6 within the next
20 years. Des Moines was chosen because of the
widespread business disruption caused by flooding in
1993.  Interestingly enough, actual flooding turned out
to be a relatively minor cause of business closures in
Des Moines.  Losing lifeline services disrupted many
more businesses.)
<p>
Most small businesses aren't insured against utility
outages. Those that do purchase business interruption
insurance are often covered only if the disruption was
caused by immediate damage
to their property.  If it stemmed solely from loss of
utilities, they need to have purchased a separate
endorsement that covers off-premises power interruption.
 This type of coverage is rare, according to Sean
Mooney, senior vice president of the Insurance
Information Institute.  It is an underutilized option
that is ignored by most retailers and offices, according
to a 1990 article in Business Insurance, an industry
periodical.
<p>
As rare as it may be in the business community at large,
acquiring off-premises power interruption coverage is
standard practice for Fortune 1000 companies, says Mike
Tuman, vice president for Rollins Hudig Hall Insurance
Brokers.  Many of those companies are not only insured
against power outages at their own facilities, but also
at their suppliers' and customers' facilities through
the contingent business interruption insurance mentioned
earlier.  
<p>
No matter who ends up paying the damages, insurance
companies or individual businesses, power outages are
costly.  Even very brief outages caused by minor
disturbances in power transmission systems cause an
estimated $3 billion to $5 billion in damages each year
in the United States.  Outages are also costly to the
utilities themselves.  Restoration expenses combined
with lost revenues caused by the Northridge Earthquake
cost California utilities well over $100 million.
<p>
Many companies have invested in uninterruptible power
systems (UPSs) that protect equipment from brief power
glitches and provide back-up electricity for about 10 to
15 minutes, on average.   Others, especially key
facilities such as hospitals, have elaborate back-up
generator systems on site.  A third option is the
procurement of hot sites -- fully equipped, alternate
office spaces that companies can utilize if their
workplace is inaccessible or without utilities.  
<p>
On-site renewable energy systems, especially PV but also
wind, micro-hydro, or biomass systems, represent yet
another option for helping businesses reduce the high
costs of business interruption stemming from power
outages.  One such PV installation keeps a U.S. Post
Office in Puerto Rico operating through power outages. A
major California bank and a large discount store have
also installed PV systems.
<p>
While each business must undertake its own analysis to
determine how best to insulate itself against costly
damage from grid disruptions, an on-site, full-time
renewable generator is one to add to the list of
disaster prevention and recovery options.  Key variables
that warrant consideration include the size of the
critical electrical load, the capital and operating
costs of various back-up options, the reliability of
each system type, insurance costs and coverage terms,
and vulnerability to power outages.

<H2>Resilient, Renewable Power Sources</H2>

<p><IMG  SRC="/rsc/mrule.gif"><p>
<blockquote>
Recent power technology advancements offer new options
to those interested in using on-site renewable energy
systems to supplement utility grid power and provide
emergency back-up power during outages.
<p>
Prior to 1994, most renewable energy systems were
either/or --either designed to function with the
utility grid, or to be free-standing.  Utility-connected
systems allowed for the sale of excess power to the utility,
but they shut down automatically when the grid failed. 
Free-standing systems could function as emergency power
sources, but couldn't accommodate excess power sales. 
A different kind of inverter was needed for each system
type.  
<p>
In 1994, Trace Engineering introduced an inverter that
can work both ways.  Its 4,000-watt, true sine wave
inverter is compatible with utility power and can
operate independently with a battery bank.  As a
result, system owners can now have the best of both worlds: 
They can sell excess power when the grid is working and
rely on renewable back-up power when it's not.  The
renewable energy source, be it solar, wind, or
micro-hydro, recharges the battery bank to provide
continuous power for as long as the grid is down. 
Safety disconnects are also part of the system to
prevent dangerous backfeeding into the de-energized
utility grid.
<p>
This dual option is also available for larger systems
(5
kW and greater) with the use of a bimode inverter/UPS
manufactured by Abacus Controls Inc.  The post office
in
Puerto Rico has such an inverter.  And KBET Radio, with
assistance from Southern California Edison and the U.S.
Department of Energy, plans to install a 10-kW
grid-connected PV system at its new station building in
Santa Clarita, 35 miles north of downtown Los Angeles. 
If a power outage occurs, the system will
instantaneously become an emergency power source for
the
station's AM radio transmitter.  KBET is a key local
Emergency Operations Center communications facility,
providing a critical link between police, fire, and
other disaster response contacts. 
<p>
Similar projects may soon become more common as
renewable energy system costs decrease and efficiencies
rise.  Residential utility customers in California also
have yet another incentive for considering PV.  A law
passed just last summer will allow customers to use
only
one meter for both PV- and utility-supplied power. 
When
solar power is fed back into the grid, the meter will
run in reverse.  The new arrangement, called net energy
metering, gives residents the opportunity to bring
their
electric bills down to zero if their PV systems
contribute as much electricity to the grid as they in
turn use from the grid.
<p>
Prior to the passage of this law, PV-system-owners were
required to purchase a separate meter for measuring the
amount of solar power contributed to the grid, and they
were paid only the wholesale power rate -- two to three
cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh).  Under this single meter
system, PV power is valued at the full retail rate of
12
to 15 cents per kWh until a zero balance is reached. 
Solar power generated in excess of this zero balance is
purchased at the wholesale rate, however, to discourage
customers from oversizing their systems.  For more
information on this development, contact the California
Solar Energy Industries Association contact listed in
Appendix One.
<p>
It's also still an option to install a completely
autonomous back-up system which always functions
independently of the grid. The homes with power
following the Northridge Earthquake had such systems.
<p>
Regardless of the type of system chosen, renewable
energy systems should be carefully sized to keep costs
down.  During a power outage, the system-owners may not
want to produce all the power their homes and
businesses
normally use, but only enough to maintain basic
operations, such as to power lights, fans, computers,
and perhaps a small refrigerator.  And, of course,
using
energy efficiently all the time will keep overall
energy
costs down and allow more efficient use of back-up
power.  For example, compact fluorescent lights use
only
a fraction of the energy consumed by their incandescent
counterparts.  
 <p>
Smaller-scale solar-powered emergency options
appropriate for homes and businesses include consumer
products such as flashlights, radios, lanterns, and
battery chargers.  About five years ago, Solec
International, Inc. offered a Solar Earthquake
Emergency
Kit that consisted of a flashlight, AM/FM radio,
two-way
CB radio, rechargeable batteries for the three devices,
a solar panel to recharge the batteries, and an AC
adaptor plug. The kit sold for about $200, but it was
discontinued after a year.  It's difficult for
solar-powered consumer products to compete with the
prices for standard flashlights and radios that are
usually powered by alkaline batteries.   However,
alkaline batteries do wear down, and replacements are
not always readily available when they're needed most. 
With increased use of laptop computers and cellular
phones -- both of which could be kept up and running
indefinitely with a solar-powered battery charger
--there could well be an increase in consumer demand
for
this type of off-the-shelf emergency solar power.  In
fact, SolarLife now offers a cellular flip phone with a
built-in PV cell to maintain battery charge.

<H2>Energy Issues in Various Disaster Environments</H2>

<p><IMG  SRC="/rsc/mrule.gif"><p>
<blockquote>
Natural disasters almost inevitably disrupt utility
services, and often the disruptions affect a much larger
geographical area than that disturbed by the disaster
itself.  For example, the Northridge Earthquake caused
power outages as far north as Idaho and Washington.  In
rural Idaho, about 150,000 customers lost power for
three hours. 
<p>
The following snapshot views of Hurricane Andrew, the
Northridge Earthquake, and two sites in Iowa during the
Great Flood of 1993 provide some insight into the
particular energy-related circumstances surrounding
these three types of natural disasters.
<p>
<H3>Hurricane Andrew</H3>
<p>
Hurricane Andrew tore through the southern peninsula of
Florida on August 24, 1992, with average winds of about
145 miles per hour and waves almost 17 feet high.  The
storm left about 3 million homes and businesses without
power, including 1.4 million Florida Power and Light
(FP&L) customers.  About 5,000 traffic signals were
damaged, 21,100 utility poles downed, and 26,158 street
lights blown out.  Several hundred thousand people lost
their homes.
<p>
Water and wastewater utilities were also hit hard, as
felled trees broke water mains and distribution lines
and power outages disabled pumps.  FP&L customers in the
northern part of Dade County (Miami area) had
electricity again within two weeks, but power in the
devastated southern end was out for at least a month --
in some cases much longer.  
<p>
Most homeowners, whose only problem was loss of power,
relied on portable gasoline-powered generators to keep
their refrigerators running and perhaps to operate a
light and a small fan for a few hours each night.  A
boil water advisory was in effect, but only those with
gas grills and enough fuel could comply.  Most people
relied on outside water supplies.
<p>
To enhance security at night in the absence of street
lights, curfews were imposed, which lasted up to four
months in some areas.  Repairing street lights was a
very low priority item, though their absence was sorely
felt.  PV-powered street lights in one subdivision
survived the storm and became neighborhood gathering
spots for residents eager to escape the darkness.  They
were manufactured by Solar Outdoor Lighting, Inc. 
<p>
<H3>Renewables and Hurricanes</H3>
<p>
On-site renewable energy back-up systems are well-suited
to meet energy needs following hurricanes because the
storms often cause such widespread, long-term,
infrastructure damage.  Getting fuel supplies for
fossil-fuel-powered generators is a challenge,
especially during the first few days, because downed
power poles, trees and debris make many roads
impassable, and driving is hazardous on those few routes
that are open.  
<p>
Solar energy is particularly viable since the storms
strike in some of the sunniest parts of the country. 
And since a hurricane usually provides at least some
forewarning, PV systems, unlike the utility grid, can be
disassembled before the storm hits and then put back up
again once it passes.  The panels can also be designed
to fold down in place prior to storms.  
 
Another renewable energy option that may be highly
applicable following hurricanes is a portable unit to
convert biomass into electricity.  Rather than
landfilling the tons of woody debris created by the
storms, they could be put to use generating valuable
power.  Another potential option to consider would be a
portable pelletizing unit that could at least convert
the debris into a usable form.
<p>
<H3>The Northridge Earthquake</H3>
<p>
The Northridge Earthquake struck Southern California on
January 17, 1994.  It measured 6.8 on the Richter Scale
and was epicentered in Northridge in the San Fernando
Valley.  
<p>
The earthquake caused widespread power outages
throughout the area and beyond, though most of them were
not prolonged.  The entire Los Angeles Department of
Water and Power system went down, leaving 1.3 million
customers without electricity. However, power was
restored to half of them within six hours, and within 24
hours, 95 percent of customers were back on line.
Southern California Edison lost 1.1 million of its 4.2
million customers, but 800,000 of them had power again
within hours. Almost all Edison customers regained
electricity within a few days.  
<p>
Despite the utilities' timely restoration of power,
close to 100,000 homes and businesses were without
electricity for more than 24 hours.  Natural gas leaks
kept power from being restored in many of the affected
areas.  Power was available but could not be turned on
for fear that sparks would touch off fires.  About 100
gas-related fires did erupt, a number of which involved
premature restoration of electric power.  Any source of
electricity would pose similar risks, so even renewable
back-up systems would have to be shut down in areas
without power due to gas leaks. 
<p>
Water supply was also disrupted due to breaks in the
supply and distribution lines.  About 50,000 Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power customers didn't have
water on the day of the earthquake, and 10,000 customers
still lacked water one week later.  Water supply
difficulties were a major problem for fire-fighters.
<p>

<H3>Renewables and Earthquakes</H3>
<p>
Though the damage to major utilities was great, most of
the longer-term problems caused by the Northridge
Earthquake were concentrated near the epicenter. 
"Normal life" with its modern conveniences was just a
short distance away, and emergency shelters were located
in areas still connected to the utility grid.   
<p>
If an earthquake of greater magnitude were to strike,
the damage would be much more widespread and extensive,
especially if it were to occur in a region that's not as
well-prepared for earthquakes as California.  Under such
circumstances, the need for all types of emergency power
supplies would greatly increase.   
Back-up renewable energy systems work well in areas that
lose power due to earthquakes but escape physical
damage.  However, it's questionable how the systems
would fare if the buildings they were on or near
suffered damage.  Portable PV generators used following
earthquakes must also be especially sturdy so they can
withstand powerful aftershocks.
<p>
<H3>The Great Flood of 1993</H3>
<p>
On July 11, 1993, the Raccoon River flooded the Des
Moines Water Works, leaving 250,000 people without
running water for 12 days. The night before, the Raccoon
and Des Moines rivers flooded electrical power
substations, affecting 35,000 households and the entire
downtown business district.  Most customers regained
power within 24 hours, though some remained without
electricity for twice as long.  
<p>
Many of those who lost utility service in Des Moines
weren't directly affected by the flooding.  Their homes
and businesses stayed dry, though they lacked critical
services.  That wasn't the case in Eddyville, Iowa, a
small town of about 1,000 people southeast of Des
Moines.  Residents there lost power because their homes
were inundated by the waters of the Des Moines River,
and the electricity was turned off for safety reasons. 
<p>

In Des Moines, the power priority was to get the water
plant up and running again and that required the use of
extremely large generators.  Thirteen generators
totaling 800 kW powered water pumps, air driers, and
other equipment used in the restoration process.  Once
the building was dry enough, two 1,600-kW units were
brought in to drive the water pump plant motors. 
Utility power was available, but it remained unreliable
and Water Works officials didn't want to take a chance
on it.
<p>
Des Moines' downtown area remained closed until the
water system went back on line.  Electrical power was
available 48 hours after the flooding, and many
businesses could have functioned without water, but the
Mayor had closed the downtown area due to fire danger. 
Without water, building sprinkler systems were
inoperable and fire-fighting abilities were extremely
limited.  
<p>
The only emergency water aid that was supplied was
drinking water.  At first, big tank trucks were brought
in and people filled their own containers; later, full
water jugs were distributed.  Though there were
naturally long lines, there was no limit on how much
water people could take.  Most people left the area to
do laundry and bathe; however, some people took showers
under drainspouts in their yards.  Others caught rain
water in buckets and barrels for flushing toilets and
washing.
<p>
As was the case with the Northridge Earthquake,  most
emergency shelters in Iowa were located in areas that
had grid power, and residents could drive out of the
affected areas to obtain needed services and supplies. 
<p>
<H3>Renewables and Floods</H3>
<p>
In flood situations, back-up renewable power systems are
of benefit mainly to homes, businesses, and institutions
that lose electrical service but remain accessible.  In
rare instances, small solar- or wind-powered sump pumps
may be able to spare buildings from water damage.  It's
common for residents in flood-prone areas to install
electric sump pumps in their basements. In low water
situations, the pumps effectively keep flood water out,
sparing furnaces and water heaters from damage.  If
electrical power is lost, these pumps cease operation
and the water starts in. If the pumps were to be
equipped with a safe, 12-volt alternate power source,
they could continue operating and possibly beat the
water -- if the level stays low.

<H2>The Use of PV by Disaster Response Crews</H2>

<p><IMG  SRC="/rsc/mrule.gif"><p>
<blockquote>
Up to this point, most of the discussion has pertained
to fixed, on-site renewable energy systems -- how they
can augment the utility grid and what role they can play
following natural disasters.  This section enumerates
the many ways that portable PV systems can aid in the
disaster response arena.
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A note about photovoltaics...
<p>
Since all of the examples discussed in this section
involve PV power, some brief background information
about the technology is helpful.  Photovoltaic cells
convert radiant energy from the sun into direct current
(dc) electricity.  A standard 12-volt, 3-amp solar
module consists of 36 4-inch-diameter cells.  The cells
are wired together in series to obtain the panel
voltage.  And though this commonly used module type is
referred to as a 12-volt panel, it actually produces
about 17 volts of dc electricity at around 3 amps.  Peak
power production per standard panel, therefore, is about
50 watts.* 
<p>
The modules can be wired together in series to further
increase voltage.  Or they can be wired in parallel to
increase amperage. For example, two standard 12-volt,
3-amp modules in series produce 3 amps at 24 volts; in
parallel, they produce 6 amps at 12 volts.  And besides
this standard module type, there are many other types of
panels designed to meet specific needs.  
<p>
Since the energy is produced only when the sun is
shining, it is usually stored in batteries for later
use.  If the load to be powered requires alternating
current (ac) electricity, an inverter, which converts dc
power to ac power, is part of the system set-up.  Most
standard home and business lights and appliances operate
on 110-volt ac electricity.
<p>
The majority of PV systems operate at remote sites where
the power demand is relatively small (less than 1,000
watts) and utility power is either unavailable,
unreliable, or cost-prohibitive.  Solar power is the
most economical and practical option in these cases. 
The number of viable applications is continually
increasing, as panel efficiencies rise and cost
decreases.
<p>
*Volts are a measure of the strength or pressure of the
electricity and amps are a measure of the current or
volume of the electricity.  Volts (pressure) multiplied
by amps (current) equals the amount of actual power
produced, measured in watts.
</BLOCKQUOTE><p>
<H3>Portable Repeaters</H3> 
<p>
Perhaps the best application for solar power by response
teams is to use PV panels to power portable repeater
stations that extend the range of hand-held radio
communications.  This application makes so much sense,
in fact, that the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) has directed its 25 Urban Search and Rescue task
forces to obtain solar panels for this purpose. 
<p>
When a task force is deployed, FEMA pays for the
purchase of equipment needed to carry out the mission. 
Only equipment listed on the Task Force Equipment Cache
List is authorized for purchase.  The list represents
about $700,000 to $1 million worth of equipment,
weighing up to 50,000 pounds.  Since the 56-person task
forces are often transported by military cargo plane to
their response destinations, space and weight
considerations loom large.  Solar is now approved only
for use with the portable repeaters; other power needs
are met by batteries (both alkaline and rechargeables)
and portable generators.    
<p>
Nida Companies, a small California-based firm founded by
Kevin Nida (a 15-year veteran of the Los Angeles City
Fire Department and a FEMA search and rescue task force
member), has designed a portable PV-powered repeater
station specifically for the urban search and rescue
environment.  The system employs two 3-amp PV panels
(about 50 watts each) wired in parallel to float charge
the 12-volt, 100-amp-hour sealed lead acid battery that
powers the repeater signal.  The repeater pulls 5 amps
when transmitting information and 1 amp when receiving. 
PV is ideally suited to meet this power need because it
can be set up in a remote spot and then left alone
indefinitely.  A generator, on the other hand, would be
well oversized for such a small load and would need
regular refueling. 
<p>
Angel DeLaFuente, a FEMA operations support specialist
and task force member from Florida's Metro-Dade Fire
Department, also sees a need for a portable, PV-powered
weather balloon repeater. Propelled upward by a helium
balloon, this system's antenna would extend at least 300
feet in the air and allow for the far-reaching
communication that is often vital following hurricanes.
To his knowledge, such as system has yet to be
developed, though he believes it would have far-reaching
appeal.
<p>
<H3>Amateur Radio Links</H3>
<p>
Ham radio operators used solar power to maintain vital
communications links following Hurricane Andrew and the
Loma Prieta Earthquake, which struck Californias Bay
Area in 1989.
<p>
And when the Northridge Earthquake knocked out utility
power at the Sulphur Mountain Microwave Repeater site,
amateur radio operators belonging to the Sulphur
Mountain Repeater Association brought PV modules from
their personal systems to the site to replenish the
batteries so that emergency communications between
police, fire, and hospitals could continue.  Siemens
Solar Industries of Camarillo, Calif., donated 22 solar
modules (1.2 kW) for the site, making it a permanent PV
installation.  
<p>
Ham radio stations often come through following
disasters when much more sophisticated communications
systems fail.  They are ideal candidates for solar
power.
<p>
<H3>Transportation Aids and Warning Signals</H3>
<p>
The Florida Department of Transportation used PV-powered
advisory radio systems as communications tools following
Hurricane Andrew. Drivers could tune in for information
on traffic and emergency assistance.  Solar-powered
changeable message signs also communicated traffic
information and alerted motorists to the advisory radio
systems.
<p>
These systems, along with PV-powered emergency telephone
call boxes, flashing barricade lights and other warning
signals, come in extremely handy not only during times
of crisis, but also for day-to-day use.  The signs and
barricades inform motorists about road construction
projects, and highway call boxes play an important
safety role.  In New Mexico, PV-powered travelers'
information radios inform tourists about the areas
they're driving through.  
<p>
PV also powers warning signals on Coast Guard buoys and
navigational beacons; solar energizes railroad signals,
aircraft warning lights, and school crossing lights. 
When a disaster disables the utility grid, these public
safety systems continue to function. 
<p>
<H3>Battery Charging</H3>
<p>
Another potential use for PV in the disaster response
arena is for charging batteries.  When rechargeable
batteries are used to power such items as hand-held
radios and cellular phones, they sometimes lose their
power before the workers can return to the base camp to
recharge them.  Work crews are often bussed to work
sites, and there they lack the vehicular chargers they
can rely on at home.  When their battery packs run down,
they're finished communicating until someone brings them
a fresh one or they return to camp.  
<p>
Because rechargeables lose power more quickly than
alkaline batteries, the rescue crews in California use
only alkalines whenever possible during response
missions.  A search and rescue 
task force member said one round of AA alkaline
batteries lasts 24 hours, as compared to 8 hours for
rechargeables. 
<p>
However, in situations where crews work long shifts and
the use of rechargeables cannot be avoided, workers
could use small PV panels to charge depleted battery
packs while in the field.  The U.S. military uses PV for
charging batteries to maintain communications between
units and headquarters.  Photocomm, Inc. designed the
ManPac military solar module battery charger precisely
for recharging 12-volt batteries at remote sites.  The
15-watt unit weighs only 1.7 pounds and folds for easy
transport inside a backpack.  Price may preclude the
widespread use of this particular product, since it
retails for $799.  More standard panels are much less
expensive and may be able to adequately meet disaster
response needs, however. 
<p>
Another PV-battery charging option would be to equip a
mobile unit with PV panels.  It could be parked at a
remote site to recharge an entire bank of cellular
phones or radio battery packs simultaneously.  Search
cameras and high-tech listening devices used to locate
trapped victims also operate on DC batteries which could
possibly be recharged using PV panels.  However, all of
these potential battery charging applications will
require field testing to determine their need and
feasibility. 
<p>
<H3>Portable Power </H3>
<p>
Portable PV power systems are especially well-suited for
meeting long-term emergency power needs at small-scale,
isolated sites. For example, following Hurricane Andrew,
four PV power 
<p>
systems were installed throughout hard-hit South
Florida.  Each system consisted of a 1-kW-peak array, a
21 kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery bank, an inverter, and a
battery charger. 
<p>
All of the solar panels were loaned by the Florida Solar
Energy Center (FSEC), and Sandia National Laboratories
contributed the batteries and controls.  FSEC actually
took a system down that was powering one of its
buildings to help with the relief efforts.     
<p>
Three of the systems were installed at small medical
clinics and one provided electricity for a relief
operations center.  They were used to operate vaccine
refrigerators, lights, fans, medical equipment, and
small radios and televisions.  Solar power was
especially ideal at the clinic locations because it kept
patients away from prolonged exposure to the noise and
fumes of portable generators.  It also enhanced the
operation of medical instruments (stethoscopes, for
example) that require a quiet environment for proper
use.
<p>
At some locations, the PV systems eliminated the need
for portable generators, and at others, solar power cut
generator use by at least half.  The systems enabled
workers to turn the generators off at night without
having to handle dry ice for the vaccine refrigerators,
and they lessened fuel supply worries.   A few of the
systems were in use for up to two months.  
<p>
At St. Anne's Catholic Mission in Naranja, Florida, one
system powered a medical clinic and another, a relief
operations center. Site Coordinator Bruce Netter
admitted he was reluctant to accept the offer of solar
power, a then-unfamiliar technology to him. After all,
it involved setting up two sizable arrays on church
property and wiring them right into the buildings'
circuitry.  He credits Sherri Porcelain, Terri Meinking,
and David Kaplan of the University of Miami's Field
Epidemiology Survey Team with talking him into the PV
option.  They knew PV worked well in these situations
from their experience at remote island field stations. 
<p>
Now Bruce Netter is a self-professed solar advocate and
wishes PV back-up systems could be standard equipment in
all buildings.  He said he was particularly struck by
the silence of PV power in contrast to the anxiety
caused by generator noise.  It made a tremendous
difference to the staff and to those served by the
clinic and those seeking food, supplies, and FEMA or Red
Cross assistance from the operations center.  A third
system was also installed on the roof of a makeshift
"grocery store," built to allow people to select their
own emergency supplies.  The system powered lights and
fans at this unusual "Amigo Mart."  
<p>
Solar electricity was also used during the aftermath of
Hurricane Hugo.  A mobile PV/generator system developed
by Photocomm, Inc. for the State of Arizona provided
power for lights and refrigeration to a YMCA community
center for over six weeks following the storm.  The
system, called the Solar Emergency Response Vehicle,
consists of a 2-kW PV array with a 6-kW back-up propane
generator, battery bank, and inverter.  The entire
system is mounted on a trailer for easy transport.  The
City of Tucson has a similar unit.  These systems,
preassembled and including the trailer and all controls,
cost about $15/watt, or $30,000 apiece.
<p>
The Sacramento Municipal Utility District in California
also has two portable PV units, though they aren't
equipped with back-up generators.  The trailer-mounted
arrays provide 600 to 800 peak watts of electricity,
with battery storage of about 4,000 to 5,000 watt hours.
 They are mostly used as demonstration models at fairs.
<p>

Portable units that arrive on the scene ready to go with
little user interaction are essential to the expanded
use of PV generators in disaster response.  During a
crisis, there is no time for careful installation of
delicate equipment.  Rescue workers must also be
educated as to the proper use of PV before the disaster
occurs, for they are not in the proper frame of mind to
learn new  technologies in the response environment. 
<p>
In the past year, Photocomm, Inc. has introduced a new
product line that may work well in the disaster response
environment. Called SUN PAK generators, the sturdy
systems are fully assembled and tested prior to
shipment, so they would be easy to set up during an
emergency.  They consist of efficient solar modules and
deep-cycle lead acid batteries, along with system
controls and optional chargers and inverters.  The solar
panels are mounted to the insulated, vented
battery/control box and provide shade for it during the
summer.  
<p>
The smallest available SUN PAK is 50 watts, and they are
available in 50-watt increments up to 1,000 watts. 
Custom units are offered in larger sizes.  The 50-watt
unit costs $1,000, and the 350-watt model, $5,500. 
Price quotes were not available for the larger units.  
<p>
Though costly, systems like these could prove invaluable
in emergency situations.  They were designed to provide
continuous power in remote applications.  It's also
important to keep in mind that PV system costs in
general decrease sharply when they are purchased in
bulk.  For example, if 100 or more systems are
purchased, discounts of 25 percent to 50 percent are not
uncommon.
<p>

<H2>Conclusion</H2>

<p><IMG  SRC="/rsc/mrule.gif"><p>
<blockquote>
Renewable energy systems can be significant contributors
to energy emergency preparedness and can help to bolster
the overall resilience of the U.S. electrical energy
system.
<p>
PV-powered warning and detection devices already help to
prevent some disasters and ensure a rapid response to
others.  Once a disaster has occurred, portable PV
systems can meet a number of small-scale emergency power
needs.
<p>
The emergency response community must now build on its
experience with portable PV power.  It is certain that
the systems must be preassembled and ready to go when
they arrive at disaster sites. Further field-testing and
design work is needed to identify optimal system sizes
and applications.  Once completed, agencies such as
FEMA, the Red Cross, and the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers may want to consider stockpiling PV systems
and providing their energy staffs with advance training
on how to install and use them.  
<p>
Beyond the emergency response realm, power failures in
general can be prevented through increased use of
on-site renewable energy systems using solar, wind,
micro-hydro, or biomass energy. The need for highly
reliable back-up power is greater than ever, considering
that a major utility grid disruption in one location can
not only cause power outages hundreds of miles away, but
also result in costly contingent business interruption
insurance claims from all over the country.
<p>
Given this reality, businesses, utilities, insurance
companies, and government and private emergency-response
agencies should actively investigate the feasibility of
on-site renewable energy systems.  While they'll find
that the purchase price of conventional fossil-fueled
back-up generators is lower, they'll also discover that
the costs of renewable energy technologies are becoming
increasingly competitive.  They also cost less to
operate, free system owners of a worrisome dependence on
fuel, and offer hard-to-quantify benefits such as
silence and clean air.
<p>
Institutions and local governments should also regularly
monitor renewable energy costs, looking for new
opportunities to employ systems.  For example, the
emergency benefits of PV-powered security lighting are
great, especially when factored against the high cost of
rampant looting that often accompanies black-outs.
<p>
And finally, renewable energy industries may want to
begin devoting more attention to the domestic emergency
power market. The frequency of natural disasters has
risen sharply over the past five years, and when
disaster strikes, it almost inevitably disrupts the
utility grid.  The time may be ripe to demonstrate the
preeminent usefulness of renewable systems to provide
vital electricity when it's sorely needed.

 Sustainable development is not just a theoretical concept.  Large  cities and
rural communities across the United States have already  put these principles to
work, proving that economic development and  environmentally and socially
healthy communities can coexist.  The Center of Excellence for Sustainable
Development commissioned two organizations -- Public Technology, Inc. and Renew
America -- to gather information on how these communities and organizations made
sustainable development work for them.  We've highlighted  several dozen of
these successful and innovative  approaches to sustainable community
development.   </P>

<P><BR> We've created two online slide shows that show outstanding  examples
of community sustainability in both rural and urban settings.  Click on the
links below to see these shows.  Each slide will be presented in a reduced view,
but can be enlarged by clicking on the reduced image.  Be aware that it can take
awhile to download graphics files.</P>
<P>
 We've also produced  a  fifteen-minute video that captures the highlights of
sustainable community development in the United States.  This video, titled &quot;Creating
Communities That Work,&quot; is an excellent tool to help introduce your
community to the principles of sustainable development.</P>
<P>
 To request your free copy of the sustainable development  video, call, write,

<P>   The following communities and organizations have been selected as
outstanding examples of sustainable development in action from Renew America's &quot;Environmental
Success Index.&quot;   Renew America, a Washington DC nonprofit organization,
has developed a rigorous data collection and verification program to select some
of most innovative sustainable development programs in the United States.  
</P>
<P>Projects selected for inclusion in this list were evaluated by an
independent group of nonprofit organizations.  In addition, each nominee 
submitted the names of five references, two of whom must be nonprofit
organizations.  Applications were judged on the basis of program effectiveness,
human development, natural resource conservation, and economic progress.</P>

<Blockquote>
	"Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."
<P align=right><b><i>	- from the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development</i></b></p></blockquote>

 In 1987, the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development published a report on the health of the global community. The report highlighted the inter-dependence between the environment and economic development. It coined the definition quoted here, which is repeated widely in books and pamphlets on the subject of "sustainability."<p>
	In recent years, a new development ethic has begun to appear, and it could be the salvation of many rural communities. It's called "sustainable development."

According to American Farmland Trust, more than a million acres of U.S. farmland are lost to development every year. That's two acres every minute.In recent years, rural America's obvious qualities - its natural beauty, slower-paced lifestyles, comparatively low crime rates, its small communities where neighbors know neighbors - have attracted new residents and new businesses. As a result, many rural communities face the dilemma of becoming victims of their own allure. <!--**foot**--><p><a href = "2.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/prev_button.gif" alt = "=Previous="></a><a href = "/slides/rural/index.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/toc_button.gif" alt = "=Table of Content="></a><a href = "4.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/next_button.gif" alt = "=Next="></a><p><img SRC="/rsc/mrule.gif"><address><p><a href="/rsc/comment-form.shtml">Comments &amp; Questions</a></i><b> | </b><i><a href="/rsc/suggest.shtml">Suggest a Resource</a></i></address><h5>URL: http://<a href="http://solstice.crest.org/">solstice.crest.org</a>/<a href="/">doe</a>/<a href="/">sustainable</a>/<a href="/slideshows/">slideshows</a>/<a href="/slides/rural">rural</a>/3.html</h5></body></html>

But questions may remain about how these communities have managed such accomplishments.<!--**foot**--><p><a href = "73.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/prev_button.gif" alt = "=Previous="></a><a href = "/slides/rural/index.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/toc_button.gif" alt = "=Table of Content="></a><a href = "75.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/next_button.gif" alt = "=Next="></a><p><img SRC="/rsc/mrule.gif"><address><p><a href="/rsc/comment-form.shtml">Comments &amp; Questions</a></i><b> | </b><i><a href="/rsc/suggest.shtml">Suggest a Resource</a></i></address><h5>URL: http://<a href="http://solstice.crest.org/">solstice.crest.org</a>/<a href="/">doe</a>/<a href="/">sustainable</a>/<a href="/slideshows/">slideshows</a>/<a href="/slides/rural">rural</a>/74.html</h5></body></html>

In 1993, Arendt reported that Farmview was "the fastest selling development in its price range in Bucks County." And, he noted, "Market surveys indicate that homebuyers are attracted to rural Bucks County by its farm fields, woodland habitats, and appealing country character...Key factors in Farmview's success have been the homesites' proximity to and views of the open spaces."<!--**foot**--><p><a href = "15.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/prev_button.gif" alt = "=Previous="></a><a href = "/slides/rural/index.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/toc_button.gif" alt = "=Table of Content="></a><a href = "17.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/next_button.gif" alt = "=Next="></a><p><img SRC="/rsc/mrule.gif"><address><p><a href="/rsc/comment-form.shtml">Comments &amp; Questions</a></i><b> | </b><i><a href="/rsc/suggest.shtml">Suggest a Resource</a></i></address><h5>URL: http://<a href="http://solstice.crest.org/">solstice.crest.org</a>/<a href="/">doe</a>/<a href="/">sustainable</a>/<a href="/slideshows/">slideshows</a>/<a href="/slides/rural">rural</a>/16.html</h5></body></html>

The inventory detailed wetlands, watersheds, and wildlife habitat areas. It described historic sites, woodlots, and prime agricultural land. According to the town's own description, the inventory "increased local awareness of the value of agricultural land, natural environmental resources, and the very strong interrelations between the physical, natural and cultural characteristics in the town."	Such increased awareness garnered local support for preservation efforts.The Land Use Program reportedly "has brought about an increased sense of community in the town and elevated the public's awareness that the natural, economic and human interactions together form Dunn's ecosystem." The town's efforts have been celebrated nationally - by Renew America and others. Claudine Schneider, chair of Renew America, has said, "When it comes to environmental achievement, the Town of Dunn and their land use plan and open space preservation program represent the very best our country has to offer."<!--**foot**--><p><a href = "58.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/prev_button.gif" alt = "=Previous="></a><a href = "/slides/rural/index.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/toc_button.gif" alt = "=Table of Content="></a><a href = "60.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/next_button.gif" alt = "=Next="></a><p><img SRC="/rsc/mrule.gif"><address><p><a href="/rsc/comment-form.shtml">Comments &amp; Questions</a></i><b> | </b><i><a href="/rsc/suggest.shtml">Suggest a Resource</a></i></address><h5>URL: http://<a href="http://solstice.crest.org/">solstice.crest.org</a>/<a href="/">doe</a>/<a href="/">sustainable</a>/<a href="/slideshows/">slideshows</a>/<a href="/slides/rural">rural</a>/59.html</h5></body></html>

The Canoe and Kayak Trail emerged from their work, as did the annual Edisto Riverfest.The trail, its guided canoe trips, and the Riverfest have attracted regional and national attention and have provided a sustainable economic boost to the community of Walterboro. Tourism has increased and trail-related jobs have been created.Initial funding for the trail included $10,000 appropriated by Colleton County for purchasing canoes and $2,500 from the South Carolina Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism for brochures.

In September 1992, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and Idaho's Department of Fish and Game had collaborated in what turned out to be a catastrophic drawdown of the reservoir. The drawdown stirred up bottom sediments and more than 50,000 tons of silt poured into one of the country's most-celebrated trout streams. This event convinced The Henry's Fork Foundation, established in 1984, that its members must become leaders in promoting a watershed approach to protecting the river.<!--**foot**--><p><a href = "42.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/prev_button.gif" alt = "=Previous="></a><a href = "/slides/rural/index.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/toc_button.gif" alt = "=Table of Content="></a><a href = "44.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/next_button.gif" alt = "=Next="></a><p><img SRC="/rsc/mrule.gif"><address><p><a href="/rsc/comment-form.shtml">Comments &amp; Questions</a></i><b> | </b><i><a href="/rsc/suggest.shtml">Suggest a Resource</a></i></address><h5>URL: http://<a href="http://solstice.crest.org/">solstice.crest.org</a>/<a href="/">doe</a>/<a href="/">sustainable</a>/<a href="/slideshows/">slideshows</a>/<a href="/slides/rural">rural</a>/43.html</h5></body></html>

The program emerged in response to the "haphazard appearance of residential subdivisions and the ensuing threat to agriculture as the economic and cultural way of life in the rural township." The town enacted a two-year moratorium on subdivision development. Residents, town officials, students and educators then "worked together to develop a common land use vision for the town." The town's Land Use Plan resulted. The plan includes exclusive agricultural zoning which limits land divisions. A Land Trust has been created to permanently protect farmland and environmentally-sensitive areas.<!--**foot**--><p><a href = "57.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/prev_button.gif" alt = "=Previous="></a><a href = "/slides/rural/index.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/toc_button.gif" alt = "=Table of Content="></a><a href = "59.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/next_button.gif" alt = "=Next="></a><p><img SRC="/rsc/mrule.gif"><address><p><a href="/rsc/comment-form.shtml">Comments &amp; Questions</a></i><b> | </b><i><a href="/rsc/suggest.shtml">Suggest a Resource</a></i></address><h5>URL: http://<a href="http://solstice.crest.org/">solstice.crest.org</a>/<a href="/">doe</a>/<a href="/">sustainable</a>/<a href="/slideshows/">slideshows</a>/<a href="/slides/rural">rural</a>/58.html</h5></body></html>

	"Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."
<P align=right><b><i>	- from the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development</i></b></p></blockquote>

 In 1987, the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development published a report on the health of the global community. The report highlighted the inter-dependence between the environment and economic development. It coined the definition quoted here, which is repeated widely in books and pamphlets on the subject of "sustainability."<p>
	In recent years, a new development ethic has begun to appear, and it could be the salvation of many rural communities. It's called "sustainable development."

 In 1989 the Oregon Legislature created the Oregon Progress Board (OPB), which is charged with developing benchmarks for measuring Oregon's "livability." As its "essential components of livability," the OPB included: "nurturing families and thriving children; healthy, educated, independent, and publicly-involved citizens; a clean, beautiful, and accessible natural environment; accessible, affordable, safe and enriching places to live and work; and a prosperous economy that provides a balanced distribution of jobs and income."

By cutting their energy expenses, residents of rural America end up with dollars to spend elsewhere. On schools, for example, purchasing books and paying teachers instead of paying through the nose for inefficient lighting or for heat that escapes through single-pane windows and uninsulated walls. 	Such energy costs received considerable attention when the residents of Soldiers Grove, Wisconsin, decided to build a brand new town.<!--**foot**--><p><a href = "18.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/prev_button.gif" alt = "=Previous="></a><a href = "/slides/rural/index.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/toc_button.gif" alt = "=Table of Content="></a><a href = "20.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/next_button.gif" alt = "=Next="></a><p><img SRC="/rsc/mrule.gif"><address><p><a href="/rsc/comment-form.shtml">Comments &amp; Questions</a></i><b> | </b><i><a href="/rsc/suggest.shtml">Suggest a Resource</a></i></address></body></html>

 During such a meeting in the Willamette Valley, home to approximately 70 percent of Oregon's population, Gov. Barbara Roberts encouraged cooperative, coordinated efforts instead of independent planning. "Acting separately and independently, we will move our local urban boundaries outward over the next 20 years, likely in competition for the very same growth, sprawling, expanding, slowly covering our farmland and open space..."

 Other evidence of Chattanooga's efforts is easy to find.  Take a look at city buses.  The city's Area Regional Transit Authority has been replacing diesel buses with new, electric shuttles manufactured in Chattanooga.

These electric buses will transport Olympic teams during the 1996 games in Atlanta.

 The state of Oregon began studying global warming in 1988, when the governor's office formed an interagency task force to investigate the risks associated with warming trends.

Later, the state completed an inventory of greenhouse gases and articulated strategies for reducing related emissions to a level 20 percent below levels emitted in 1988. The state's global warming action plan considers the interaction of energy, transportation, land use, and other environmental issues.

City of Portland - Sustainable City Principles<p>
Goal: The City of Portland will promote a sustainable future that meets today's needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs, and accepts its responsibility to:
<ul>
	<li> Support a stable, diverse and equitable economy
	<li> Protect the quality of the air, water, land and other natural resources
	<li> Conserve native vegetation, fish, wildlife habitat and other ecosystems
	<li> Minimize human impacts on local and worldwide ecosystems
</ul>
  In November 1994, the City of Portland adopted ten "Sustainable City Principles." Principle Seven reads: "Act locally to reduce adverse global impacts of rapid growth of population and consumption, such as ozone depletion and global warming, and support and implement innovative programs that maintain and promote Portland's leadership as a sustainable city."

 This low-income home will feature passive solar heating, a wall system of mineralized wood chips and cement, and other examples of sustainable design.
<p>
It was built in collaboration with Austin Habitat for Humanity and the American Institute of Learning. The home is part of a Green Habitat Learning Project which employs disadvantaged and "at-risk" youth to build earth-friendly homes for low-income families.

<blockquote>
"Then I say the earth belongs to each...generation during its course, fully
and in its own right. The second generation receives it clear of the debts and
encumbrances, the third of the second, and so on. For if the first could charge
it with a debt, then the earth would belong to the dead and not to the living
generation. Then, no generation can contract debts greater than may be paid
during the course of its own existence."</I><br>
<p align=right><b><i>	- from Thomas Jefferson, September 6, 1789</i></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Nearly 200 years earlier, Thomas Jefferson described a similar
ethic, providing evidence that although the term "sustainable development" is new, the concept has been around for a long time.

 During its three years of operation, the Mothers of East Los Angeles-Santa Isabel program has distributed nearly 50,000 ultra-low flush toilets (ULFTs). Other Community-Based Organizations  have also pitched in. More than 270,000 ULFTs have been distributed, resulting in an estimated savings of 3.4 billion gallons of water per year.

In 1993, Arendt reported that Farmview was "the fastest selling development in its price range in Bucks County." And, he noted, "Market surveys indicate that homebuyers are attracted to rural Bucks County by its farm fields, woodland habitats, and appealing country character...Key factors in Farmview's success have been the homesites' proximity to and views of the open spaces."<!--**foot**--><p><a href = "15.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/prev_button.gif" alt = "=Previous="></a><a href = "/slides/rural/index.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/toc_button.gif" alt = "=Table of Content="></a><a href = "17.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/next_button.gif" alt = "=Next="></a><p><img SRC="/rsc/mrule.gif"><address><p><a href="/rsc/comment-form.shtml">Comments &amp; Questions</a></i><b> | </b><i><a href="/rsc/suggest.shtml">Suggest a Resource</a></i></address></body></html>

	<I>"Sustainability refers to the ability of a society, ecosystem, or any such ongoing system to continue functioning into the indefinite future without being forced into decline through the exhaustion...of key resources."</I><br>
	- from "Description of a Toolkit for Sustainably Redeveloping Communities" prepared for DOE by Helen J. Kessler, Sieben Associates
<p>
     Few would dispute that there is a limited supply of most of the planet's resources - clean water and air, minerals, plants, animals, agricultural land.  And residents of the United States consume a disproportionate share.
<p>
In 1992, at the U.N.-sponsored Earth Summit in Brazil, scientists spread the word. Americans, who represent only 5 per cent of the planet's population, consume one-third of the earth's resources.
<p>
Much of what we consume, we waste - through carelessness, laziness, inefficiency, and poor design.
<p>
And waste isn't just an issue of ethics. Waste hurts our health, our economy, and our quality of life. Industrial waste produces pollution. Urban waste produces abandoned downtowns and empty buildings. Energy waste produces high energy bills and oil wars...

 Architect Richard D. Browning writes: "Portland, Oregon, is one of the few U.S. cities with affordable housing within easy cycling and walking distance of a vibrant, pedestrian-oriented downtown.

"But the Willamette River separates downtown from most of the neighborhoods with middle-income housing, posing a major barrier to bicyclists and pedestrians."

	<I>"Our fundamental premise is that Industrial Culture has the means to transcend the apparent conflict between material progress and planetary health, between individual gain and common good."</I><br>

	- from "Sustainable Communities" by Sim Van der Ryn and Peter Calthorpe (Sierra Club Books)
<p>
	The point's been made before, as it was nearly a decade ago in the seminal book about sustainable development. Others, too, have described the way economy and ecology can, and must,  dovetail in a strong and sustainable union.

 	The city of Chattanooga found just such a "fish head" on the shores of the Tennessee River. In 1978, state officials in Tennessee closed the Walnut Street Bridge. The bridge, built in 1891 in Chattanooga to span the Tennessee River, was a safety hazard, and demolition loomed.
<P>
But a group of citizens rallied to save the bridge. They argued it could enliven a new riverfront park development. Funds, public and private, were raised. The bridge was saved, restored, rehabilitated.
<p>
Completed in 1993, the Walnut Street Bridge has promoted natural resource conservation, economic progress and human development...The bridge is said to be a source of inspiration and satisfaction for the citizens of Chattanooga.
<p>
The bridge helped resurrect the city's abandoned and under-used riverfront. Project supervisors report that runners, walkers, cyclists, roller-bladers, and pedestrian commuters have now reclaimed this once languishing area. The bridge has helped link Chattanooga's North Shore business district, its central downtown business and entertainment district, as well as its Bluff View cultural and historic district.

 Old toilets were returned, crushed and mixed with gravel to be used as a base for road-paving material. The bags in this slide are filled with crushed toilet pieces ready for use. Much of this road-base has been used to repair street and freeway damage caused by the last big Los Angeles-area earthquake.

 Most of the river's bridges "accommodate bicycles, pedestrians and the 
 disabled either grudgingly or not at all," Browning wrote. "Thousands of 
 people living within sight of their high-rise offices are too intimidated 
 by the gauntlet of bridge crossing to ride a bicycle or walk to work."
<p>
 Grassroots groups convinced local and state agencies to examine how Portland's
bridges might better serve its resident walkers and wheelers and bicyclists. A
task force spent 18 months identifying problems and proposing solutions. Some
gains have been made. The Burnside Bridge now features bicycle lanes. But more
work remains.
<p>
Browning suggests urban designers must "plan transportation systems that allow
human beings to go confidently wherever they please, under their own power and at
their own pace."

The inventory detailed wetlands, watersheds, and wildlife habitat areas. It described historic sites, woodlots, and prime agricultural land. According to the town's own description, the inventory "increased local awareness of the value of agricultural land, natural environmental resources, and the very strong interrelations between the physical, natural and cultural characteristics in the town."	Such increased awareness garnered local support for preservation efforts.The Land Use Program reportedly "has brought about an increased sense of community in the town and elevated the public's awareness that the natural, economic and human interactions together form Dunn's ecosystem." The town's efforts have been celebrated nationally - by Renew America and others. Claudine Schneider, chair of Renew America, has said, "When it comes to environmental achievement, the Town of Dunn and their land use plan and open space preservation program represent the very best our country has to offer."<!--**foot**--><p><a href = "58.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/prev_button.gif" alt = "=Previous="></a><a href = "/slides/rural/index.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/toc_button.gif" alt = "=Table of Content="></a><a href = "60.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/next_button.gif" alt = "=Next="></a><p><img SRC="/rsc/mrule.gif"><address><p><a href="/rsc/comment-form.shtml">Comments &amp; Questions</a></i><b> | </b><i><a href="/rsc/suggest.shtml">Suggest a Resource</a></i></address>

	Across the Hudson, similar efforts are under way in Newark, New Jersey, home base for Rutgers Urban Gardening, which also serves Orange, East Orange, and Irvington.
<p>
Through the Rutgers Urban Gardening program, a state and federally-funded project of Rutgers University Cooperative Extension, more than 300 vacant lots have been transformed. Trashed and desolate spaces like this one on Lincoln Avenue in Newark have been converted into 2,000 lively and productive neighborhood gardens.

 Francis Bacon observed that "knowledge is power." We need both knowledge and power to face the challenges of the current and coming century.
And part of what we know about sustainable development is this:<br>
1. Sustainable communities are communities with a future.<br>
2. Sustainable development is a way to consider together environmental health, economic growth, and the needs of current and future generations.<br>
3. Sustainable development is happening now, in communities across the country.<br>

 Developed and administered by Portland's Energy Office, the Block-by-Block Weatherization Program increases energy efficiency in low-income households by providing free basic weatherization and energy-use education to eligible residents.
<p>
	As this slide shows, contractors or non-profit crews install insulation in attics, walls, or crawl spaces. To date, the program has helped weatherize 1,770 homes at a cost of about $900 per house.

 In places like Chattanooga, Portland, East Los Angeles, Newark, and Denver, residents and sustainability experts have teamed up to build a new future.
	And, during a time of mushrooming population growth coupled with diminishing resources, a new future is what we all need. 

For us. For our children.

More than two thousand miles away, in a very different climate, builders have been enlisted also in sustainable efforts in Austin, Texas.
<P>
 Austin's "Green Builder Program" has received support from diverse sources. From the U.S. Department of Energy. From Habitat for Humanity. From the local builders association...
<p>
As originally conceived, the Green Builder Program was designed to expand an existing system of criteria used to rate the energy efficiency of new homes. Its newer criteria were developed to consider issues related to water use, building materials, and solid waste.
<p>
Pictured here is a newly-constructed residence employing passive design, recycled and salvaged materials, rainwater collection, efficient lighting and appliances and other "green" features.

 	On the East coast, other gardening projects enliven and enrich urban areas.
<p>
In 1994, volunteers from the "Green Guerillas" group in New York City provided, free-of-charge, nearly $300,000 in plants, gardening materials, and hands-on assistance to more than 20,000 New Yorkers.
<p>
The Green Guerillas volunteer their assistance to community gardens, housing shelters, and institutions. They inform urban residents and city officials about how community gardening can strengthen low-income neighborhoods.

<I>"Achieving sustainable cities requires active citizen
participation...sustainability requires inspiring citizens to move from
short-term, selfish interests toward a broader long-term public good: active
responsibility."</I> 	<br>
- Randolph T. Hester Jr., from "Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Sustainable Happiness," in Places, winter 1995
<p>
	 One lesson, perhaps the most important, is that sustainable development must be a community-wide, grass-roots commitment. Citizens must be involved.
<p>
When Americans are inspired (as during World War II)  and educated, rather than pushed, they often embrace efficient use of resources.

  In the last five years, the  HGP has employed 100 people - people like Vietnam Vet Bill Tracey pictured here - and paid out a total of nearly $200,000 in wages. Garden shareholders receive 29 weeks of fresh food.
<p>
Sales from the garden, from flower arrangements, dried flower wreaths, and beeswax candles made up 37 percent of HGP's revenues in 1994.

 Another example of win-win sustainable development is occurring in Los Angeles. In 1992, "The Mothers of East Los Angeles-Santa Isabel" piloted a water conservation program in cooperation with city agencies and local utilities. During a period of eight weeks, one thousand ultra-low flush toilets, like these seen here in boxes, were provided free to customers of Los Angeles' Department of Water and Power.

 The city issued itself a challenge. In five years, its energy bill would be reduced by $1 million annually, a significant savings for taxpayers. First, the Energy Office examined the city's energy bills to determine Portland's annual energy expenditures.
	Then, the Energy Office arranged energy audits. It provided technical and design assistance, arranged for energy loans, publicized projects and educated employees.
<p>
In four years, the office has identified annual savings of $950,000 in energy costs and has projects completed or under way to produce additional savings.

 Scientists know that carbon dioxide and certain other gases absorb the sun's infrared rays, warming the earth's atmosphere. Studies in Portland have determined that motor vehicles are the area's "primary CO2 villain." A 1988 study concluded that cars and trucks in the metropolitan area emitted 6.8 million metric tons of CO2.

Chattanooga's example...<br>
<blackquote>
	"Advocates for the environment and proponents of economic development, once at odds in cities like Chattanooga, have today recognized their need for interdependence. Global pressures are forcing our businesses to be more competitive as they become more environmentally sensitive."
	<p align=right><b><i> - Mayor Gene Roberts</i></b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Chattanooga's Mayor Gene Roberts is proud of his city's attempts to embrace the principles of sustainability. There has been a conscious effort to balance the needs of economic development and environmental health. As an added bonus, Chattanooga's efforts are winning national attention.
<p>
The Christian Science Monitor wrote:<br>
<I>"Today the mid-sized metropolis on the Tennessee River is earning a world-wide reputation as a model for combining environmental initiatives and economic development."</I>

In another program called BEST,  "Businesses for an Environmentally Sustainable Tomorrow," Portland's Energy Office serves as a broker, helping area businesses learn about sustainable practices for their energy, water, waste, and transportation functions.
<p>
The program emphasizes energy efficiency, water conservation, waste reduction (recycling), and clean and efficient transportation. It also emphasizes and has achieved cooperation among city government agencies, utilities, state agencies, and business and professional organizations.
<p>
Meanwhile, as Portland implements innovation solutions to urban and global  problems, all Oregonians fret about Portland's growth and the associated impacts on their quality of life.

The town's Land Use Plan resulted. The plan includes exclusive agricultural zoning which limits land divisions.

 There's still time to design a new future, one more in tune with the earth's limited resources. "Sustainability" can be the foundation for that new future.
	 A new time when degraded, polluted landscapes are historical features.  A time when the human race embraces a new relationship with ecosystems large and small, rural and urban - a relationship of sustainability.

In the gathering depicted, local farmers join Rick Duff for a discussion about sustainable agriculture.	 According to RuralAction, many farmers in Southeast Ohio have trouble making ends meet.

	Randolph T. Hester Jr., a professor of landscape architecture at the University of California, Berkeley, bemoans such waste. He writes about "finding fish heads." 
<p>
In years past, fish were caught, cleaned, cut into fillets. Fish heads were considered useless waste. Today, fish heads have new value as organic fertilizer and other products. Hester, using a metaphor, encourages city officials to search out these so-called "fish heads" in their own communities - old and neglected buildings - like these in Atlanta; untapped energy sources; waste heat that can be captured; retired residents whose life experiences can offer invaluable resources; and trash that can be recycled...

 If the SRF and others succeed, Stapleton will offer "a real world example of sustainable development of significant scale." 
<p>
In Denver, in Chattanooga, and elsewhere, city planners and government officials are beginning to see that "green cities" do not exclude "greenbacks." Instead, sustainable practices can provide a profound catalyst for ailing cities. 
<p>
Vice President Al Gore emphasized this point while speaking to an audience in Chattanooga whose members included CEOs from Fortune 500 companies. Gore encouraged business leaders to consider locating in cities "deeply committed to sustainable development" which can offer "an... extraordinary quality of life for the men and women who work in the company."

 In his book Babbitt, author Sinclair Lewis informed us that George Babbitt's car was "poetry, tragedy, love and heroism." 

For many city planners and urban residents, gasoline-driven cars, trucks and buses are more tragic than poetic, polluting the air, requiring the use of precious space for parking,  and consuming incalculable resources.

 Another Chattanooga-area project is the "Orange Grove Recycling Center." Orange Grove is a non-profit, sheltered workshop for people with mental disabilities.

In partnership with the city of Chattanooga, the Orange Grove Recycling Center trains and employs approximately 100 people to process recyclable materials collected from the community.

The center has created jobs, reduced landfill loads, increased awareness with regard to community recycling efforts.

 This is the same lot after cleaning, preparation, and conversion to a community vegetable garden.
<p>
Gardeners benefit in many ways - from improved nutrition; from savings on grocery bills; from an increased sense of self-reliance and  from the relaxing toil of horticulture. Gardens become settings for social interaction, community building, problem solving. 
<p>
Across the nation, people are working together to tackle such projects. For some, their labor is inspired by memories of a bygone era, a time of pristine swimming holes, clear skies, and fish free of mercury.
<P>
For others, a large measure of their toil is inspired by a vision of the future, a time when the young will return to play in rivers and streams, a time when our cities will no longer be shrouded in clouds of pollution.

The drawdown stirred up bottom sediments and more than 50,000 tons of silt poured into one of the country's most-celebrated trout streams. This event convinced The Henry's Fork Foundation, established in 1984, that its members must become leaders in promoting a watershed approach to protecting the river.<!--**foot**--><p><a href = "42.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/prev_button.gif" alt = "=Previous="></a><a href = "/slides/rural/index.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/toc_button.gif" alt = "=Table of Content="></a><a href = "44.html"><img src="http://solstice.crest.org/common/next_button.gif" alt = "=Next="></a><p><img SRC="/rsc/mrule.gif"><address><p><a href="/rsc/comment-form.shtml">Comments &amp; Questions</a></i><b> | </b><i><a href="/rsc/suggest.shtml">Suggest a Resource</a></i></address>

	<I>"Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."</I><br>
	- from the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development
<p>
 In 1987, the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development published a report on the health of the global community. The report highlighted the inter-dependence between the environment and economic development. It coined the definition quoted here, which is repeated widely in books and pamphlets on the subject of "sustainability."

 Portland was the first major U.S. city to officially acknowledge the possibility of global warming and to take concrete steps to lessen the city's contributions to the "greenhouse effect." In March 1993, Portland hosted the "International Global Warming Solutions Symposium." In November 1993, the city announced its Carbon Dioxide Reduction Strategy.

 Austin's Green Builder Program has become a model and resource for sustainable building initiatives around the world.
	
Many "sustainable community" programs like Austin's Green Builder program provide clear-cut examples of the proverbial "win-win" situation -where the benefits reaped are economic, environmental, and human.

What is "sustainability?" What is "sustainable development?" In many ways "sustainability" is an umbrella term.

Beneath its broad cover, sustainability includes reference to innovative approaches to:<ul>
<li> energy conservation
<li> urban design
<li> waste treatment
<li> transportation
<li> urban forestry
<li> and many other disciplines.
</ul>

But what does "sustainability" really mean?

 In order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, Portland has taken progressive measures to meet its goals. The pie chart illustrates the focus areas. Each piece represents an area targeted and notes its role in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. For example, changes made in the transportation sector are responsible for 21 percent of the total Plan's reduction goal. Most savings will come from changes made in resource utilization.

<title>The Use of PV, cont.(2)</title>

<!--**head**-->
<H2>The Use of PV, cont.(2)</H2>
<H3>Outdoor Lighting</H3> 

<p><IMG  SRC="/rsc/mrule.gif"><p>
<blockquote>
The clinics and relief shelters that hosted PV power
systems following Hurricane Andrew also benefited from
PV-powered outdoor security lights.  Though they were
low-power systems compared to traditional street lights
(30 watts versus 250 watts), they made a big dent in the
total darkness.  A few PV-powered street lights in a
Dade County subdivision also survived the storm and
became popular gathering spots for neighborhood
residents.   In addition, Kyocera America donated a few
hundred solar-powered lanterns to relief efforts, and
they were appreciated by those living in the tent
cities.
<p>
Some outdoor emergency lighting needs are too large to
be met with PV systems.  Outdoor staging areas where
food and water were distributed to hurricane victims
were lit with large banks of 400-watt lights powered by
10 to 15-kW generators.  Similar systems are used
following earthquakes to accommodate the large numbers
of people who congregate in parks, afraid to return to
their homes.
<p>
In less-populated -- but very dark -- areas, however, PV
outdoor lights are ideal.  They represent yet another PV
application that works well not only during emergencies,
but all the time.  They can be found illuminating
parking lots, highway signs, parks, trails, and bus
shelters.  In many cases, using solar power is more
economical and expedient than extending utility service
to these locations. 
<p>
<H3>Water Purification</H3>
<p>
Water system disruptions seem to be almost as common as
utility grid failures following disasters.  And although
rescue workers are proficient at quickly mobilizing
clean emergency water supplies into areas of need, it
may be more efficient in some cases to transport not
water supplies but water purification equipment. 
Treating tainted water on site would mean one less
continual supply chain to tend.
<p>
Dr. Ashok Gadgil of the Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory has developed a highly efficient water
purification system that delivers up to four gallons per
minute of potable water.  The water flows by gravity
through a trough below an ultraviolet light.  The
ultraviolet radiation emitted kills most viruses and
bacteria present in the water.  The lamp used resembles
the standard fluorescent tube common in offices, but
it's made of a special glass that is transparent to
ultraviolet light and it's not coated with phosphor.  
<p>
The system's only power needs are the 40 watts of
electricity required to operate the lamp, making it an
ideal candidate for PV power.  And while it was designed
to provide clean water to citizens of developing
countries, it would be ideal for emergency use wherever
water supply disruptions occur. 
<p>
<H3>Water Pumping</H3>
<p>
PV could also be used to pump water during emergency
situations. Some portable solar pumping systems do not
require batteries but work directly off the power
supplied by the array.  These systems have proven to be
cost-effective for pumping water for livestock on remote
ranches, and they may also be suitable for accessing
water in isolated, disaster-affected areas.  Most pumps
brought in to combat flood waters or restore flooded
utility structures have power needs much greater than
what PV could feasibly supply, however.  
<p>
Pumps for gasoline are another emergency need because
loss of electricity disables all the gas stations in an
area.  Although conventional gas pumps require more
electricity than could practically be provided by a
portable PV system, PV-powered pumps could possibly be
used to extract gas from the underground storage tanks. 
As with battery-charging, this potential application
requires further study and field-testing.
<p>
<H3>Water Heating</H3>
<p>
Solar thermal technology was employed to provide hot
water for a relief kitchen in Florida City following
Hurricane Andrew. Steven K. Gorman of Renewable Energy
Group in Jacksonville, Florida, donated a water heating
unit capable of providing up to 1,000 gallons of hot
water per day.  Without hot water to ensure health and
safety, emergency kitchens cannot function.  The solar
unit allowed this particular kitchen to continue
operating.  The system has since been equipped with
PV-powered pressure pumps, allowing it to deliver
pressurized hot water.  It's been mounted on a flat-bed
trailer for portability, and Gorman says it has been
used to provide emergency hot water on numerous
occasions.
 
One additional water-related solar option that is a sure
bet is "solar shower" devices.  These low-tech products
generally consist of a simple black plastic
water-bottle-type bag with a spout attached.  The bag is
filled with water and then left in the sun, so it can
provide a warm shower at the end of the day. About of
dozen of these were donated to Hurricane Andrew relief
efforts.  They were a big hit with relief crews after
long, hard shifts.
<H3>Remote Monitoring</H3>
<p>
Solar power is involved in many emergency situations
even before disaster strikes.  Hundreds of remote
PV-powered sensors, dataloggers and information
transmitters send continuous data to central offices for
use in flood, drought, and forest fire forecasting. 
Information on weather patterns and seismic data, water
quality and highway conditions, is transmitted in this
manner.  In the Los Angeles area, PV powers a radio link
that would inform the Southern California Gas Co. of any
leaks affecting its natural gas storage well. 
<p>
Consolidated Edison Co., the electric utility which
serves New York City, uses photovoltaics to power
oil-detection buoys in waterways near its generators. 
The system was jointly developed by ConEd, EXXon Corp.,
and Spectrogram Corp., and it's now commercially
available through Spectrogram, which is based in North
Haven, Conn.
<p>
The system, called the Oil SPill Remote Alarm System, or
OSPRA System, consists of buoys equipped with sensors
that continuously monitor the water quality and detect
the presence of oil by sensing its fluorescent
properties.  If a spill is detected, the sensor
immediately reports data to the base station computer.
Both the sensor and the information transmitting
functions are powered by a battery kept float-charged by
PV panels located on top of the buoys.

The techniques sound like they come from the dark ages of psychotherapy: straightjackets, windowless rooms, patients being "taken down" to the carpet... But these are just some of the elements of <STRONG>Peninsula Village</STRONG>'s program for deeply troubled adolescents. Do they go too far, or are they the last hope for desperate parents? <STRONG>Betty Bean</STRONG> looks at both sides of the issue.

Locked Down</H1>
<P><STRONG>Can strongarm tactics help troubled teens overcome their personal dilemmas?</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Betty Bean</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>The pictures in the brochure are lovely, starting with the full-page color photo of misty mountains and tall pine trees. There's one of a counselor working with attentive-looking girls in front of a crackling fire, another of kids paddling a red canoe over blue water, and a bright, autumn shoreline peeking through the fog.
<P>The text describes Peninsula Village as a residential treatment facility for hard-to-reach adolescents ages 13-18 who suffer from drug abuse, depression, conduct problems, eating disorders, and self-endangering and/or out-of-control behaviors. The brochure says the program is affordable, innovative, and above all, successful. It features a number of outdoor activities, including building, landscaping, and farming.
<P>Located in Blount County on the banks of Lake Loudon near the Peninsula Hospital complex, Peninsula Village is made up of two campuses, one for boys and one for girls, with a separate schoolhouse on each campus. It looks like summer camp.
<P>Angie Montgomery, administrative director at Peninsula Village, says the average length of stay is eight or nine months, although the Village is developing a shorter-term treatment program as well. The program does not accept psychotics, fire starters, or children with IQs below 85. There are currently 92 patients at the Village, which she says is entirely separate from Peninsula Hospital and Peninsula Lighthouse, which are located in the same area and are under the same ownership.
<P>A parent's handbook explains that the program uses Native American symbols and philosophy, providing patients with a rite of passage--the Vision Quest--guided by the Medicine Wheel, where living creatures learn to live in harmony.
<P>Friendly, vivacious Amy, who completed her Village stay last year and has come back for a post-holiday visit, had been in six other treatment programs and considers herself living proof that the brochure is not just full of pretty pictures and empty claims.
<P>"I'm grateful for this place," she says. "I'd be dead if it weren't for it..."
<P>Amy's friends had a surprise for her on this visit: she was presented with the Village's highest honor--the Buffalo, which the handbook describes as the "animal of Wisdom...He has turned his own difficulties into a way of life in which he reaches out to others with similar problems without losing sight of his own needs and process...The Buffalo is awarded rarely."
<P>The Village's clinical director is psychologist Vance Sherwood, who has been there for 8 years. He says the present-day activities, which evolved from an intensive chemical dependency program conducted in a restricted setting with no distractions, "is very much my design." He also says it is considered one of the very best in the country.
<P>"Most of our business doesn't come from Knoxville," Sherwood says. "Since 1990, we have been marketing nationally. We are a major national player."
<P>But some observers--including former patients and employees--find Peninsula Village to be overly harsh in its treatment of troubled adolescents. 
<H3> </H3>
The Village boasts a success rate of around 80 percent, which its critics say is unnaturally high. As proof, Sherwood cites a detailed outcome study conducted by in-house staff who collected data on 101 ex-patients. Criteria for success included no further psychiatric hospitalizations after discharge, no trouble with the law after discharge, and satisfactory adjustment to work or school.
<P>Amy, for example, counsels other Village graduates who live near her home in Charlotte, North Carolina.
<P>The Village treatment plan begins with the Special Treatment Unit, or STU, "an extremely intense therapeutic experience... unlike other locked unit programs... specifically designed to address resistance and introduce patients to our group-oriented treatment approach, which uses peer pressure to create positive change."
<P>Sherwood says new patients are "fairly homogeneous. They all might be described as out of control. Most are heavy into drugs, wildly labile, and prone to fits of anger and depression. Many are treatment failures. These kids care very little for adult authority, but are hypersensitive to peer pressure."
<P>Once a change in attitude is affected (namely, when the adolescent is more compliant to authority figures), patients move out into the cabins, where they begin what a former patient who wants to be known as Elizabeth calls "the Indian program."
<P>Elizabeth, who is 17, says that her seven weeks in STU were anything but therapeutic.
<P>"At first, I was kind of happy to be going," she says. "I wanted to go-- had my bags packed for two weeks. We [she and her mother] went and saw the cabins. It was like camp, with log cabins. They didn't tell us anything about the STU. That was a big shock. Things started to go down when they put me in a straitjacket. It's called a burrito...I would be in the middle of the floor where everybody could watch me..."
<P>Elizabeth was diagnosed with bipolar disorder--commonly known as manic depression--when she was 7 years old. This diagnosis is somewhat controversial in some segments of the world of mental health care, where some psychiatrists--albeit a  dwindling number--insist there is no such thing as bipolar disorder in children. Elizabeth, her family, and her psychiatrist have no doubts about her diagnosis.
<P>In 1994, amid a bout of severe depression, she was having great difficulty relating to her peers, who teased her unmercifully. So the school system, with her mother's consent, made what is called an "educational placement" and enrolled Elizabeth for long-term treatment at Peninsula Village.
<P>The results were disastrous. She spent a little less than two months in the locked building that is the first stop for new patients, who are required to stay there for an extended period before they can move out into the mainstream of the Village's wilderness program. The length of stay in STU varies according to each patient's responsiveness to the rigorous STU regimen.
<P>Patients in the STU have their clothes taken from them, and although they are allowed to write letters home, they cannot receive mail or talk on the telephone with their parents. They are dressed in hospital gowns if they are deemed "elopement risks" or violent. Otherwise, they wear hospital scrub suits until they earn back their street clothes.
<P>Less serious outbursts are handled by attendants who take offenders down to the ground and hold them there. More serious episodes may land patients in a "burrito" (straitjacket) or in five-point restraint--bound limb and torso with leather straps to a bed. Doors are locked, windows are covered, and lights are on 24 hours a day. Patients are escorted to the bathroom.
<P>To prevent kids from forming "anti-therapeutic cliques," patients are not allowed to talk to one another or to make eye contact. Every move is monitored, and they must ask for permission to speak to attendants.
<P>Sherwood believes he knows who Elizabeth is and says he made a mistake admitting her in the first place; that he gave in to the importuning of her mother to allow her into the program. Elizabeth's mother denies this claim, saying her daughter was placed there by the school system.
<P>He says the STU is designed to force patients to work on their own problems and to work together as a group--to become responsible to their peers.
<P>"We offer intense treatment you don't get anywhere else in this nation. This program is for people whose lives are messed up in a major way, on their way to ruining their lives or someone else's. Most of these kids are multiple treatment failures, and when they fail at the Village, they don't have many options left."
<H3> </H3>
Elizabeth never progressed past STU, and was released (actually thrown out of the program) in far worse condition than when she was admitted.
<P>Elizabeth was, and still is, under a psychiatrist's care and was taking medication to control her symptoms. Both she and her mother believe that her downward spiral began when the Village staff (against the advice of her psychiatrist, John Robertson) cut down on her Trilafon, an anti-psychotic drug she had been taking for some time. Journals that Elizabeth's mother kept of conversations with the Village social worker (whose job it was to serve as a liaison to the family because STU patients are not allowed to speak with their parents) show that the Trilafon dosage was cut in half.
<P>Elizabeth, who was threatening to kill herself, was discharged from the Village in handcuffs and transported into town, where Dr. Robertson found a bed for her in the Children and Adolescents Psychiatric Services (CAPS) unit at St. Mary's. She was there for six weeks for treatment-resistant psychotic mania. It is hard for her to remember everything that happened, but she insists she wrote letters home that her mother never received, and that an attendant "busted" her lip during one of her manic episodes.
<P>Marilyn, the mother of a boy who is a successful Village alumnus,  says she is glad she didn't know about the STU. Her son was deeply involved with marijuana and alcohol, suffered from depression, and was confrontational with his family. Like Elizabeth, he was placed at the Village by the Knox County School System.
<P>"Most of our good fortune is because we didn't investigate. We didn't know what STU was. He was there for three and a half months--he was rebelling. He hit the carpet a lot. If a child was acting up, they'd push an alarm button and take the child down to the carpet for a count of ten. If that didn't stop it, a doctor would be called in to administer a shot in the buttocks, and they'd be taken to bed to sleep it off for 8 to 10 hours. That blew my daughter away [when she heard about it afterward]. She said 'What are you doing to my brother?'
<P>"But we had been down that road so many times...Finally, he earned a place in a cabin."
<P>Marilyn is so grateful to the staff at the Village that she does volunteer work there. She did art work illustrating Native American themes and gave this interview. She says one of the most important things she has learned is that "If our child happens to relapse, we don't have to relapse with him...And what the Village did was help us re-establish trust."
<P>One former Village employee who worked on the STU says he disapproves of the methods used there.
<P>"I wouldn't want my kid to go there. I would want my child to be in a structure that is more caring. This seems more like prison, or a prisoner of war camp."
<P>This former employee says he was not successful at the Village because his personality was "unsuited" for their program.
<P>"They wanted me to be stern, to use a military-type approach. My approach is more caring, to help the patients along. I didn't have that in me...One thing that really bothered me was that the patients were not allowed to speak. They've got to raise their hand, got to be acknowledged by staff, and a lot of times staff would just ignore them. There was a guy who left when I first started--a nice guy. The caring type, didn't last long. They said that doesn't belong here. They want their type of structure..."
<P>Larry Gibney, chief juvenile probation officer of Knox County, says the Village is OK by him.
<P>"I don't have anything bad to say about those folks. They have been a consistent, stable care provider. There have been a dozen other care providers who've come and gone, but they've been there..."
<P>Joshua Williams is the president of the Tennessee Psychological Association as well as former director of Children's Hospital Integrated Psychiatric Services (CHIPS), that shut down last year. He says Peninsula Village "is viewed with ambivalence by mental health professionals. I've been privy to outcomes both positive and not positive."
<P>He says that Sherwood "is licensed, inspected, and accountable to the licensing board for health care facilities. The physicians are accountable and the hospital is accountable. That doesn't make it [treatment in the STU] less repugnant. I work under the premise that civil rights are inviolate. Food, shelter, basic safety--humiliation is not therapeutic, in my view. If you describe those conditions to me, I would say that's sadistic."
<P>Sherwood reacts sharply:
<P>"I'll tell you what's sadistic--to take someone whose life is going down the toilet and let them go."
<H3> </H3>
Amy and her friend Claire are a little older than Elizabeth and do not share Elizabeth's negative feelings about Peninsula Village. It's the first week after the holidays, and they have returned for a visit. Amy is attending a community college back home in North Carolina; Claire, who says she was pregnant and addicted to crack cocaine when she became a patient at the Village, is preparing to go off for her freshman year at the University of Maine. They are both glad to be back.
<P>Amy fingers the silver buffalo medallion around her neck, signifying her great progress and her contributions to the other girls at the Village.
<P>Claire wants to work here as a counselor one day. She, too, thinks the Village salvaged her life.
<P>"I was into some deep stuff," she says.
<P>The two Village alums are joined for a walk in the woods on this unseasonably warm January day by two soon-to-be-discharged Village residents, Emily and Jennifer. As they crunch through the dead leaves, all four point out things they built--a porch on the Village schoolhouse, a greenhouse. 
<P>They are proud. Emily and Jennifer say they're a little scared to be thinking about leaving, but like Claire and Amy, they are looking forward to the future. Jennifer wants to be a doctor; Claire a civil engineer; Amy a landscape designer; Emily an architect (it is probably not a coincidence that the program at the Village includes lots of digging, hammering, and sawing). They are all clear-eyed and friendly.
<P>Jennifer gets teased, in a friendly way, for her sharp New Jersey accent. She says she has been in eight prior treatment programs and that she is at the Village because of her mother.
<P>"My mom is very dedicated to me. She was going to send me to a treatment program in California, but then she found out about this one. This is the best  in the country."
<P>When the girls hear about Elizabeth's experiences in the STU, they recall their own stays there.
<P>"STU gets you back to earth because when you come here, you're so stuck up," says Amy.
<P>"I spent four and a half months there, but at the end, I didn't want to leave STU," Claire chimes in.
<P>Jennifer, who spent a relatively brief six weeks in STU, has mixed feelings.
<P>"When I first came here, I was absolutely defiant. I showed up at STU with a cigarette."
<P>But she goes on to elaborate: "STU wasn't all good," she tells her friends. "There was a lot of not hearing what I had to say. I'd had surgery, and they didn't believe me when I said there were calisthenics I couldn't do. In a way, I don't blame them, because I lied so much. But I wouldn't be where I am now without STU."
<P>She says she misses her family, "But I'm really afraid I'll mess up when I leave."
<P>As the girls talk about their lives, a group of patients from a boys' group troop by, steadfastly staring at the ground.
<P>The contrast between Elizabeth's story and those of the other four girls couldn't be starker.
<P>One observation is, however, easy to make. Amy, Claire, Emily, Jennifer, and the unnamed boy were all serious substance abusers with problems that, though severe, were not uncommon to similarly situated young people. They, and probably their families, obviously believe they have benefited from the rigorous discipline and the 12-step philosophy at the Village.
<P>Elizabeth was not a user of alcohol or illegal drugs. Her problems stemmed from a medical condition over which she had little control, and it broke her when her medication was reduced at the same time she was placed in a tough new environment and separated from her mother.
<P>Sherwood says Elizabeth's is an isolated case.
<P>"The Village really changes the lives of these kids. It's great to be able to say our program really works, because it does. The thing that makes most of us view it as Camelot is we take these horribly twisted, destroyed people and make them start again. We do something here that's precious."

I've always liked winter better in movies than in real life, especially snow. On film, you can enjoy the serenity of the season without wiping off windshields or slogging through slush. And there's no danger of losing body parts through overexposure.
<P>So this week's video picks are a salute to snow, for people who like the idea of winter more than the reality (next week, we'll do a tropical theme for those of you who just want to forget that it's January).
<P>A lot of people called <STRONG>Fargo</STRONG> the best movie of 1996. It's also the best winter movie I can remember. Northern Minnesota isn't just the setting for Joel and Ethan Coen's morbid, hilarious comedy--it's a frozen, monolithic presence, throwing the movie's characters into colorful relief. Frances McDormand gave the performance of the year as a pregnant police chief unraveling a kidnapping gone wrong, and the rest of the cast is nearly as good. The movie's also a sly send-up of the annoying "based on a true story" genre.
<P>Maybe the most famous winter scenes in any movie are from Charlie Chaplin's <STRONG>The Gold Rush,</STRONG> in which Chaplin's trademark tramp goes prospecting in the Yukon and has to fight off man, beast, and especially Mother Nature. The 1925 silent classic is still fresh and funny 70 years on. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for?
<P>If the comic cannibalism in Chaplin's film isn't enough for you, you can see the real thing in 1993's <STRONG>Alive,</STRONG> which recounts the true story of a Uraguayan rugby team stranded in the snowy Andes. The movie has a terrifying plane crash, an equally devastating avalanche scene and undeniable drama. Whether it's something you actually want to submit yourself to is, well, a matter of taste.
<P>The final pick, 1992's overlooked <STRONG>Orlando,</STRONG> isn't specifically a winter movie, but it has one of my favorite winter scenes: a dazzling 17th century ice carnival that sings--as does the whole film--with magic and imagination. Based on Virginia Woolf's tale of a gender-switching immortal (played guilelessly by Tilda Swinton), Orlando manages to compress four centuries of social commentary into a festive, 93-minute romp.

<H1><IMG SRC="701_crucible.gif" HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=252 ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10>The Play's the Thing</H1>
<STRONG>For better and worse, The Crucible is faithful to its source.</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Jesse Fox Mayshark</EM>
<P>There are a lot of reasons to appreciate the new (and first) movie adaptation of Arthur Miller's 1953 play, The Crucible.
<P>The first is simply that the film could not have been made 44 years ago, when the play set audiences and critics buzzing with its daring, explicitly political theme.
<P>And the new production, with a screenplay by Miller himself, is a scrupulously faithful rendering of the Salem witch-hunt drama that will bring smiles to high school English teachers across the nation (in a way that, say, last year's Demi Moore-ized The Scarlet Letter did not).
<P>But that faithfulness also gives a chance to reassess Miller's original work from a distance, and truth be told, it comes up a little short. The movie is meant to canonize the play, to establish it as a masterwork of 20th century drama, and it's only partly successful--despite some terrific acting and crisp direction--because the play just isn't up to it.
<P>The story is familiar, of course. A gaggle of teenage girls in 17th century Salem, Mass., sets off a tempest of Puritan "cleansing" by accusing dozens of people of witchcraft. Miller meant The Crucible, with its demented courtroom scenes and bizarre interrogations, as an indictment of totali- tarianism in general and McCarthy-ism in particular.
<P>All of the play's big points--that fear breeds fear, that innocent people can be compelled to confess, that campaigns for purity are inherently oppressive--still resonate. When one of the judges mutters, "I hadn't expected so much of our evidence to come from children," it's hard not to think of the recent goings-on in Wenatchee, Wash., where dozens of adults were accused of participating in a child sex ring that turned out to be an invention of troubled children and overzealous prosecutors.
<P>Even so, The Crucible is missing something. It's too mannered and didactic to be completely involving as a story, and as a political statement, it seems more studied than passionate. Unlike some political art--Picasso's "Guernica," for example--Miller's play loses impact outside its original context.
<P>The movie (like the play) also fails to capitalize on its other major theme. The girls' accusations are actually triggered by their own experimentations with magic, which the movie shows in a striking opening sequence. Implicit in the fireside ritual--and in the nightmare of injustice that follows--is the teens' rebellion against sexual and social repression. But that gets pushed to the sidelines in The Crucible's film version, a victim of Miller's preoccupation with McCarthy. (For a better, equally dark exploration of the same theme, check out Peter Jackson's compelling Heavenly Creatures.)
<P>All that aside, there's some fine filmmaking in The Crucible. Director Nicholas Hytner shows the same skill for removing staginess from a theatrical adaptation that he did in 1994's The Madness of King George (a better movie because it was a better play). The movie's final shot in particular shows how much a good director can say with the simplest of images.
<P>On the performance front, The Crucible gives us two of moviedom's biggest names--Daniel Day-Lewis and Winona Ryder--in their second costume drama together (the first was The Age of Innocence.) It confirms what we already knew about them: he's one of the great actors of our time; she's not.
<P>Day-Lewis tears into his role as the wrongly accused John Proctor, who is haunted by past sins but unwilling to compromise his principles. With the exception of Denzel Washington, no other contemporary leading man invests so much passion in every part. Along with Joan Allen as his emotionally bruised wife, Day-Lewis brings much-needed heat to the generally chilly production. Ryder, as the chief accuser, is appropriately shrill and venomous, but she never quite escapes the drama-school earnestness that marks all her serious roles. Her problem is not, as her detractors say, that she can't act; it's that her acting is too obvious, connecting on an intellectual rather than emotional level.
<P>The rest of the cast is adequate but unremarkable, except for Paul Scofield, who is genuinely frightening as the piously bloodthirsty head judge.

MOVIE GURU RATING: <STRONG>Meditative</STRONG><P>
<IMG SRC="../graphics_dir/rating_3.gif" ALT="Enlightening" HEIGHT=72 WIDTH=216>
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>So what we have in The Crucible is not a play or film for the ages, but a well executed, intelligent drama that probably needed to be made, if just as a reminder that we have the freedom to make it. And it's destined for immortality of a sort, I suppose, in the VCRs of high school English classrooms everywhere.

<H3>Attention, Frank Cagle. Here's Something That's Not Jimmy Naifeh's Fault</H3>
Remember all the talk in November about how we need to clean up the election commission, put people on there who will do the right thing instead of just treating the seat like a political pay-off? If Republican state Reps. <STRONG>Jim Boyer</STRONG> and <STRONG>H.E. Bittle </STRONG>have their way, Republicans will vote to put a Boyer crony, <STRONG>John Tindell,</STRONG> on the Election Commission. Tindell, a political wannabe who has been unsuccessful in getting himself elected, is a salesman who works out of Hamblen County.
<P>Boyer, the current Knox County delegation chairman, and Bittle, who wants to be delegation chairman, have cut a deal--Boyer gives up the chairmanship, Bittle votes for Tindell to replace the late <STRONG>Hazel Showalter,</STRONG> who was the only woman on the board. They've evidently got the vote of Oak Ridger <STRONG>Randy McNally,</STRONG> who allegedly represents a little slice of northwest Knox County, and they're lobbying for delegation dean <STRONG>Ben Atchley</STRONG>'s vote, which will get them over the top for Tindell.
<P>Sort of affirmative action for white guys.
<P>Left behind in the good ol' boys' tobacco juice are two GOP women, <STRONG>Donna Wright</STRONG> and <STRONG>Becky Longmire, </STRONG>who have been targeted by a smear campaign: "Horrible, horrible. She was for metro. She was for Clinton."
<P>Democrat <STRONG>Joe Armstrong</STRONG> could figure into the mix, too. Could be he'll vote for Bittle for chairman. And since Armstrong has been looking to protect the job of Registrar-at-large <STRONG>Irene Lovely,</STRONG> wonder what Tindell's position will be on the issue of whether Lovely, who bollixed up the unification vote, should keep her job?
<P>But wait. What's that on the horizon?
<P>Looks like <STRONG>Tim Burchett.</STRONG> Looks like Tim Burchett might like to be chairman. Looks like Tim Burchett might think it's time to appoint an educated, hard-nosed woman to the board. Also looks like the redoubtable <STRONG>Mary Lou Horner</STRONG> is riding in with the Women's Political Caucus, reminding the fellas that it might not look good to have a he-man woman-hater board. Saturday morning's meeting of the legislative delegation could get interesting. Be there to see your government at work.

<H3>A River Runs Through It</H3>
Pigeon River fighter <STRONG>Bobby Seay</STRONG> has issued a challenge to Knoxville City Councilman <STRONG>Gary Underwood,</STRONG> who has issued a challenge to Champion International to clean up the Pigeon River, because it runs into the French Broad which runs into the Tennessee which runs through Underwood's district, don'tcha know. Seay, of Newport, is a founding member of the Dead Pigeon River Council, which long has been in the trenches against the North Carolina mega-polluter. He was here the night City Council passed Underwood's resolution, which deplores the pollution of the Pigeon. In a televised interview, Seay asked Underwood to lobby Chattanooga's City Council to pass a similar resolution, since the river runs through there, too. 

<H3>Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas</H3>
It was the day before Christmas, and <STRONG>Kristin Hoke</STRONG> (a perennial favorite with Metro Pulse  readers) was working out her notice. She'd been informed by Channel 10 news director <STRONG>Margie Nichols</STRONG> that her contract, which was to run out Dec. 31, wouldn't be renewed, and Hoke was slated to work until the following Sunday.
<P>But Nichols ordered Hoke into the personnel office and informed her that that day  would be her last...
<P>A source says "Kristin mentioned that Margie said she was doing this so Kristin could spend time with family and 'enjoy the holidays.' I assume Kristin spent the holidays alone, because her family is nine hours away...This was a calculated move so Kristin couldn't say good-bye to her co-workers and viewers..."
<P>So Hoke started packing her gear. After a few minutes, Nichols walked up to her told her to be out of the building by noon.
<P>"She said 'Let's wrap this up.' Kristin asked if she could stay an hour extra to save some video and Margie said no. We were all in shock..."
<P>Nichols, however, sees it differently: "I didn't fire her on Christmas Eve," she says. "She knew 60 days out [that she didn't have a job after Dec. 31]. I just wanted her to have the holidays off."
<P>Channel 10 has been hemorrhaging employees--55 since last May, sources say.

<H3>Recklessness</H3>
That fatal van-motorcycle accident involving state <STRONG>Sen. Carl Koella</STRONG> caught the attention of the editors of at least one national magazine: American Motorcyclist. In the January issue, a two-page feature about the tragedy, illustrated with a photo of late motorcyclist <STRONG>Terry Barnard's</STRONG> mangled Yamaha, is sardonically headlined "SPIN DOCTRINE: Motorcyclist dies, senator re-elected." The article questions why Koella waited an hour to give a confused account of the accident, and why police waited almost five hours to administer a breath test--but saves its bitterest comments to respond to Koella attorney <STRONG>Jerry Cunningham's</STRONG> pre-election public statements that a mysterious unidentified witness had earlier seen the victim--a 52-year-old churchgoing Navy veteran and head of an Ohio household--driving recklessly. "Could the spin doctors find a way to blame Barnard's death on Barnard himself?" the article goes. "After all, he's only a motorcyclist. And there's an election to be won."

<H3>Moon Over Knoxville</H3>
The rumors of the demise of <STRONG>Blue Moon Bakery</STRONG> were greatly exaggerated. True, the Moon did close for a few days, but it has reopened under new management. Owners <STRONG>Karl</STRONG> and <STRONG>Gloria Testerman</STRONG> handed over the operational reins to partners <STRONG>Kelly Langthim</STRONG> and <STRONG>Pam Watson,</STRONG> who say they've totally revamped the menu and are making the place "bigger, better, friendlier and more service-oriented." The Moon continues to shine Monday through Thursday 8 to 4; Friday and Saturday 8 a.m. to 11 p.m.

<H3>NEW SCHTUFF</H3>
Our very own <STRONG>State Champs</STRONG> are ready and raring to unleash Songs for a Better Tomorrow, their much anticipated nonconcept album. Look for this tour de force at local stores very, very soon, or pick up a copy at the band's CD release party at Mercury Theatre on Friday, January 17.
<P>Those ever-so-clever pranksters the <STRONG>Opposable Thumbs</STRONG> have released Our Cheapest Chicken, a cassette collection of "pisstakes, retakes, remakes, etc., recorded directly on to cassette from a CD master," according to guitarist/singer/musical action hero <STRONG>Todd Steed.</STRONG> Songs include "Superdrag Groupies," "No More Credit at the Liquor Store," and a re-working of the Smokin' Dave smash hit "Truth About Lies." Find it at all your favorite local record outlets.
<P>Also hitting store shelves this week is a sizzling slab of vinyl from technophiles the <STRONG>Speed Freeks.</STRONG> A remixed version of the song "Slower," from the band's Himalayan EP, is backed with "Wise Up," a preview cut from their forthcoming full-length 44.1. Look for that disc sometime in March.
<P>"Rough punk rockers" the <STRONG>Malignmen</STRONG> can also be heard on vinyl, in the form of the seven-inch single "See I Ate," b/w "Bond." Look for a review in this space very soon.
<P>Meanwhile, you'll only be able to find the latest release from local jazz guru <STRONG>Donald Brown</STRONG> in the import bins. Piano Short Stories was released last year for European distribution.

<H3>NEW SCHTUFF, PART DEUX</H3>
On the new band front, local punk, uh, denizens <STRONG>David Burns</STRONG> and <STRONG>Steve Schmidt </STRONG>(of <STRONG>Thumbnail</STRONG> fame, natch) have joined with guitarist <STRONG>Kim Keeler</STRONG> to form the charismatic <STRONG>Kissing Virus.</STRONG> Check out the intoxicating slide guitar action and Keeler's wild and sultry howl (kinda like a hybrid of Thalia Zedek and P.J. Harvey) when they take Gryphon's on Saturday, January 25.
<P><STRONG>Boy Genius</STRONG> features the high energy talents of former FaceDown man <STRONG>Tom Appleton</STRONG> (on guitar), plus bassist <STRONG>Scott West </STRONG>and drummer <STRONG>Dustin West.</STRONG> They recently revealed their punky power poppy nuggets at a show at Mercury Theatre with <STRONG>Torture Kitty;</STRONG> check the Metro Pulse calendar for upcoming dates.
<P>And from the gone-but-definitely-not-forgotten ashes of <STRONG>Wateva </STRONG>comes the bass-and-drums combo <STRONG>40 Deuce.</STRONG> I haven't seen or heard them yet, but trust me: when I do, you'll be the first to know.

<H3>FREEBIE JEEBIES</H3>
No catch, they promise... <STRONG>Cornerstone Recording Studio</STRONG> (yes, right here in Knoxville) is looking to give away ten free recording sessions. To be eligible, you must 1) be an "established musical group with some original material," and 2) send 'em a tape. Cornerstone's <STRONG>Roger White</STRONG> says, "We will listen to all entries, and if we like what we hear, your group will get a free recording session. We are simply looking for good groups with good songs to do some good recordings." Send a tape to Cornerstone Recording Studio, 8715 Rutledge Pike, Knoxville  37924.

<H3>TAPE O' THE MONTH</H3>
<STRONG>Beeswax
<BR>The Wrath and Fury of the Backslide Trash Heap Jive</STRONG>
<BR>Although they've been compared (with good intentions, to be sure) to Pavement repeatedly on these pages, Beeswax comes into their own and--for the most part--shrugs off the connection with The Wrath and Fury of the Backslide Trash Heap Jive (even more so now that they've added second guitarist Gray Comer). Sure, Todd Stapleton's vocals tend to be devil-may-care, and, yes, the guitars swagger as they stagger. But this is a band that has gone from being so lackadaisical they could've been a west coast bride to a sound that is at once low-slung and loose, yet never careless.
<P>Never mind saving the best for last; the band kicks in immediately with the air raid siren-gone-wrong guitar lash of "Anti-Acoustic Blues Groove in C", which settles into an infectious churn of rumbling noise while the whole thing plays out like a roller coaster ride. Along the way, the fantastic "Fodder" (with its stuttering, slit-eyed buzz of a groove), relentlessly hooky "As Iowa Slowly Shrinks," and ringing rush of "Thermal Bremmstrahlung" provide thrills, spills, highs, lows, jaw-rattling rhythms (courtesy of bassist Scott Heiskell and drummer Scott Henshaw), giddy speeds, screeching halts, until the bottom drops out from under you and slides home on a wave of ghostly noise called "Scapegoat."
<BR>Good to the last start-stop-start, and not a silly love song in the bunch.
<BR><STRONG>Beeswax play with String Joy at Gryphon's on Sat., Jan. 18; and State Champs at Gryphon's on Fri., Feb. 7.</STRONG>
<P><EM>Zippy "Despite all my other amazing powers, I am not omniscient--so quit bitching and make contact" McDuff</EM>

With an impressive ratio of one acre of park land to every 119 Knoxvillians, Knoxville has an abundance of recreational space that many cities our size would envy.

Sure you would - because Knoxville is a used car wonderland.
<BR>There's probably a good reason why Knoxville has almost as many <STRONG>used car lots</STRONG> as it does drivers.

<H2><P ALIGN=CENTER>A Brief History of Metro Pulse</H2>

<P><STRONG>Knoxville journalism, circa 1991, is a primal chaos, spewing random "alternative" publications across local sidewalks: The Lame Monkey Manifesto, The Addict, The Brass Check, The Watch, Township Jive, Skin Flute, The Warm Jet, Cabin Fever, 14 Days. Amid this swirl of media excess comes a new addition, one that somehow manages to outlive its peers...</STRONG>

<H3><HR>January, 1991</H3>
<STRONG>Rand Pearson,</STRONG> a cocky 22-year-old University of Georgia graduate who'd recently worked as an underling with Athens Magazine, returns to his home town with few clues. The aspiring writer works as a cook and lands a walk-on role as a grief-stricken father in a Heartland Series special. Failing to find work at Whittle Communications and humiliated by a public poetry reading at the Torch, he mulls the prospect of starting a lifestyle magazine in Knoxville.

<H3><HR>April, 1991</H3>
<STRONG>Ian Blackburn,</STRONG> one of the former publishers of the subversive journal Lame Monkey Manifesto, meets at the Falafel Hut in Fort Sanders with sometime associate <STRONG>Ashley Capps,</STRONG> cutthroat music promoter, jazz D.J., and brains behind ill-fated nightclub Ella Guru's. The two discuss an alternative newspaper project. Capps would handle advertising and editorial. Blackburn, an eccentric longhaired computer wizard and known juggler, would design and produce.

<H3><HR>July, 1991</H3>
Over a pizza of pesto and sun-dried tomatoes at the Flying Tomato, Capps introduces Blackburn to Pearson and his friend <STRONG>Margaret Weston.</STRONG> Over conversations at the Tomato, Pearson, Weston, and Blackburn refine an entertainment calendar project that would only later become something like a magazine.

<H3><HR>August 18-19, 1991</H3>
In Blackburn's cluttered Fort Sanders apartment, Pearson, Weston, and Blackburn assemble the first issue of a new magazine. One promising title is Hot Stuff. Unable to come up with anything better, the near-editors call the magazine Metro Pulse. Blackburn recalls it as "an all-night affair that made plain what kind of hell we had gotten into." Local authorities seize Pearson's car from the private-apartment parking lot, delaying delivery of the first issue. The project seems cursed.

<H3><HR>August 19, 1991</H3>
Days before Whittle Communications moves into its shimmering new headquarters, the first issue of Metro Pulse appears in downtown Knoxville in a small format, about the size of a real-estate sales tabloid.

<H3><HR>Fall, 1991</H3>
A pool of writing contributors largely composed of UT students and Whittle refugees, with a median age of perhaps 21, produces the first issues of Metro Pulse. The staff witnesses several dawns in Blackburn's chaotic chambers.

<P><STRONG>Jon Wallace,</STRONG> burly, overshaven frontman for a hardcore punk band, the STDs, becomes the copy editor too late to have prevented early damage.

<P><STRONG>Coury Turczyn,</STRONG> a Detroit native of Eastern European extraction who'd left a perfectly good job as a magazine editor at Whittle Communications to seek his fortunes as a screenwriter in Hollywood, returns to Knoxville, older, wiser, and desperate. After months of lurking around the corridors of the Whittle Building looking for scraps, he begins writing a Metro Pulse column called Bar Spy. It is rumored that people are actually reading the entire column.

<H3><HR>December, 1991</H3>
<P><STRONG>Jared Coffin,</STRONG> who'd created some artsy ads for Java, draws a Metro Pulse cover and later joins as art director. The paper follows Blackburn's move to a Sutherland Avenue apartment after he was evicted for having a cat.

<H3><HR>December 31, 1991</H3>
<P>The Knoxville Journal ceases publication just as people had begun to pay attention to it. Out-of-work Journal-ists cast around town for hack work. 

<H3><HR>January, 1992</H3>
<P>Metro Pulse moves into its new headquarters on the third floor of Bijou Theater, sharing quarters with Ashley Capps's AC Entertainment. That month, the bi-weekly publishes its first full-size tabloid issue and experiments with actual reporting.

<H3><HR>February, 1992</H3>
<P><STRONG>Pat Hinds,</STRONG> former publisher of a successful student publication called The Watch, joins Metro Pulse as ad manager. There's brief discussion of combining the two ventures as a new journalistic monster called Metro Watch.

<H3><HR>March, 1992</H3>
<P>Unable to sell a single movie script in Hollywood, Coury Turczyn replaces the retiring Margaret Weston as managing editor of Metro Pulse. He introduces the innovative concept of having actual "cover stories."

<H3><HR>April, 1992</H3>
<P><STRONG>Bonnie Appetit,</STRONG> rumored to be a libidinous editor of medical trade books, introduces her singular style of restaurant reviewing with a critique of Hooters. She suggests the owners open a version for female diners named "Peckers." Optional motto: "Sportin' a Woodie."

<H3><HR>May, 1992</H3>
<P><STRONG>Jack Neely,</STRONG> disgruntled Associate Hack for a magazine distributed in doctors' offices, writes 600 words blaspheming Andrew Jackson. Turczyn proposes it become a regular feature of Metro Pulse to be called "Knoxville Babylon." Neely, who'd been reading a creepy murder book called The Secret History, has another idea. Turczyn offers $15 for each one. Astonished, Neely accepts.

<H3><HR>May, 1992</H3>
<P>A fluorescent light mysteriously shorts out, causing a sinister blaze in the Metro Pulse offices. Ceiling sprinklers prevent the fire from destroying the most historic building in East Tennessee, but flood the staircase, moistening an art show on the second floor and swamping the paper's photo scanner.

<H3><HR>June, 1992</H3>
<P>Latin bombshell and Journal investigative firebrand <STRONG>Betty Bean</STRONG> begins writing occasional pieces.
<P>Bean conveys intelligence that County Executive <STRONG>Dwight Kessel</STRONG> and friends were plotting to start their own weekly paper in the wake of the Journal fallout--only after they realized it would cost too much to restart the daily. Pearson alertly presents Metro Pulse to the so-called Phoenix investment group, but later scuttles an offer to make Metro Pulse the entertainment section of this new venture. Nonetheless, the stir brings Metro Pulse to the attention of one <STRONG>Joe Sullivan.</STRONG>

<H3><HR>July, 1992</H3>
<P><STRONG>John Mayer,</STRONG> shadowy former beatnik and pulp-novel connoisseur, launches the darkly brilliant but impossibly complex detective comic series, "Knoxville Confidential." 

<P>Metro Pulse launches its newer, hipper look, enhanced by the appealingly disturbing icons of <STRONG>Timothy Winkler,</STRONG> a moody local artist about whom very little is known for certain. Soon afterward, he starts charging real money for his illustrations.

<H3><HR>August, 1992</H3>
<P>Former intern <STRONG>Shelly Ridenour</STRONG> becomes calendar editor; soon, her Spotlights and band descriptions are among the shortest and most memorable paragraphs ever printed in Metro Pulse.

<P>Joining the paper is willowy production manager <STRONG>Laura Atkinson,</STRONG> who vows to make sense of the madness.

<H3><HR>November, 1992</H3>
<P>Financially embarrassed by a year of Metro Pulse, Pearson's group and Ashley Capps sell the white elephant to Joe Sullivan. An Ivy-League financial czar allegedly linked to old Knoxville families, Sullivan is a former reporter for The Wall Street Journal and longtime boss of a Chicago securities-exchange mob. Convinced that Metro Pulse could give Knoxville's remaining daily a run for it, Sullivan re-establishes his roots to realize a cub-reporter's dream.

<P>Metro Pulse moves to larger quarters on the mezzanine of the Burwell building--again, above the box office of an ancient Gay Street theater.

<H3><HR>December 1992</H3>
<P>In response to a single letter written by a member of a Baptist church, Kroger boots Metro Pulse from the racks in all of its stores. At question is a handful of gay personal ads, deemed inappropriate for sensitive grocery shoppers. After managing to get back on the racks, Metro Pulse is booted again for a story on Knoxville's gay club scene (though the back-breaking straw is claimed to be a single quote from the story by a drag queen who says, "They love me because I'm so f---ing gorgeous.")

<H3><HR>January, 1993</H3>
<P><STRONG>Lee Gardner</STRONG> leaves his relatively new job as a Whittle editor to join Metro Pulse as staff writer. His Whittle colleagues tell him he's crazy. "Metro Pulse? Are you serious? It can't last. Lee, think of your future."

<H3><HR>June, 1993</H3>
<P>Peppery promotions coordinator <STRONG>Charlotte Klasson</STRONG> joins the paper's front lines, later to become advertising manager.

<H3><HR>July, 1993</H3>
<P>In its annual convention in Austin, Texas, the ordinarily discerning Association of Alternative Newspapers, which had denied Metro Pulse official sanction one year earlier, unanimously votes to admit Metro Pulse to its ranks.

<H3><HR>August 1, 1993</H3>
<P><STRONG>Barry Henderson,</STRONG> another hard-boiled veteran of the Journal, returns home after an extended sojourn in Communist China. An angst-ridden caffeine addict and known associate of Jim Dykes, Henderson joins Metro Pulse as editor to combat the widespread prejudice that Metro Pulse is staffed entirely by spoiled, fruity brats. He brings with him an innate ability to write baffling headlines ("Like Topsy, West Knoxville Just Grows," "Strings But No Towrope," "Pressure for Equity Brings More Women Into Sports-Happy UT Fold").

<P>Betty Bean quits to seek more challenging work at the Halls Shopper.

<P>Editors succumb to a bizarre publicity ploy, persuaded by the TNi cable channel to send one reporter to appear on the "i-Channel News" and talk about his or her current story in Metro Pulse for fully 90 seconds each week. Stunned by the mystery of Lance West's hair, writers say little of substance on the air.

<H3><HR>January, 1994</H3>
<P>Smarting from a reader letter ridiculing his writing style as "hyper, yet flaccid," Lee Gardner quits Metro Pulse to write promotional copy for Ardent, a Memphis record company. To replace him, the paper hires one <STRONG>Chris Barrett,</STRONG> an obscure nuclear submariner from Kentucky discovered openly writing for the Morristown paper.

<H3><HR>March, 1994</H3>
<P>Metro Pulse conducts its first annual Best of Knoxville survey.  Entrepreneurs voted "Best" finally take Metro Pulse seriously.

<H3><HR>May, 1994</H3>
<P>Metro Pulse shocks the journalistic establishment by winning several regional awards at the annual Society of Professional Journalists banquet, beating out several well-known local celebrities. Staffers were especially astonished. None of them are even members of the Society of Professional Journalists. 

<P>The jocular <STRONG>Stephanie Moyers</STRONG> enlists as an account executive. Cohesion expert and all-around office guru <STRONG>Betty Franklin</STRONG> also joins the ranks.

<P>On the condition she not be expected to appear physically in the Metro Pulse office, Betty Bean returns as staff writer, vague about her experiences with the Halls Shopper. Likewise, Lee Gardner returns as staff writer, vague about his experiences with Ardent Records.

<H3><HR>December, 1994</H3>
<P>Metro Pulse moves a third time, to the third floor of the Arnstein Building, the longtime headquarters of the now defunct Whittle Communications. 

<H3><HR>February, 1995</H3>
<P>Envious editors of big-city alternative magazines offer big money to lure Metro Pulse staffers away from Knoxville. Lee Gardner leaves to become music editor for City Paper, Baltimore's alternative weekly, becoming the first--and to date only--Metro Pulse staffer to quit twice. Meanwhile, Jared Coffin quits to take the artistic helm of the massive Dallas alternative weekly, the Dallas Observer. 

<P><STRONG>Lisa Horstman,</STRONG> longtime Whittle vet and national award-winning author/illustrator of a children's book called Fast Friends, takes over as art director. Tranquillity reigns. And smilin' Jay Nations, former proprietor of the near-mythical Raven Records, a longtime front for subversive musical activities, joins the staff as account executive.

<H3><HR>April, 1995</H3>
<P>Bonnie Appetit quits as Restaurant Rover to flak for a certain presidential campaign in Nashville. Gourmet Pyle, the clever nom de guerre of a nationally famous author, takes her place and promptly makes Metro Pulse readers even angrier than Bonnie Appetit ever did.

<H3><HR>June, 1995</H3>
<P>Bonnie Appetit returns, vague about her experiences with said presidential campaign.

<H3><HR>June 1, 1995</H3>
<P>After more than a year of threats, Metro Pulse doubles its frequency, becoming Knoxville's most exciting weekly since Parson Brownlow's Knoxville Whig and Rebel Ventilator.

<H3><HR>June 29, 1995</H3>
<P>Metro Pulse publishes its 100th issue, approximately 96 more than most people predicted back in 1991.

<P>Mysteriously efficient business manager <STRONG>Judy Rone</STRONG> brings Metro Pulse closer to the long-awaited black. 

<P>>Post-punk State Champs drummer and half-breed Italian lasagna chef <STRONG>Chris Leather</STRONG> takes the designer's seat in the dangerous, often rhythmic production room.

<H3><HR>July, 1995</H3>
<P>Chris Barrett hosts the First Annual Metro Pulse Brew-Off, allegedly the largest regional beer-brewing contest in modern times. He appears tipsy at work the next day, is often missing from his desk, and starts calling co-workers "Bubba." 

<H3><HR>August, 1995 </H3>
<P>Metro Pulse scoops the entire planet with Shelly Ridenour's cover profile/travelogue about Superdrag's New York recording sessions, 11 months before the boys hit the Billboard charts. 

<H3><HR>November, 1995 </H3>
<P><STRONG>Regina Williamson,</STRONG> aspiring novelist from Somewhere Out West, takes the hot seat as MP receptionist. 

<P><STRONG>Leslie Buxbaum</STRONG> brightens Metro Pulse's day as ad rep. 

<H3><HR>December, 1995 </H3>
<P>Rand Pearson's Scruffy City Publishing inexplicably publishes a collection of Jack Neely's Metro Pulse columns, entitled Knoxville's Secret History. After several book signings, Neely begins endorsing his paychecks Who loves ya, baby? Jacko.

<P>Grizzled editor Barry Henderson, the last of a generation of hard-living newspapermen, stuns the local publishing establishment when he accepts a job as editor of the Prague Post. He chose the Czech Republic as his new home because its layer of carbon monoxide reminds him of the Arnstein Building stairwell.

<H3><HR>January, 1996 </H3>
<P>Ponderous News-Sentinel editorial page editor <STRONG>Bill Dockery</STRONG> leaves his lucrative post to take Henderson's place at the helm of Metro Pulse, explaining his action to the stunned publishing establishment by paraphrasing John Milton: "I would rather reign in Hell than serve in Hell."

<P>Female Metro Pulse staffers, who had been baby-free for the paper's entire history, undergo a mysterious plague of infants, as one female employee after another vanishes from the office--only to return with wailer in arms. Stephanie Moyers, Betty Franklin, and new classified ad rep Eve Mynatt are victims. 

<H3><HR>February, 1996</H3>
<P>Clean-shaven bachelor <STRONG>Mike Gibson,</STRONG> formerly of the Mountain Press, joins as staff writer, specializing in the more dangerous assignments that spouses and parents are reluctant to accept.

<P><STRONG>Julie Lewis,</STRONG> a blonde, nimble Marylander who claims not to be kin to Juliet Lewis, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Huey Lewis, Jerry Lewis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Jewel, or Julie Andrews, begins as assistant account executive.

<H3><HR>April, 1996</H3>
<P>After the Best of Knoxville results are made public, oft-maligned Mayor Victor Ashe and desert-isle fantasy Kristin Hoke make unexpected but brief appearances at the Metro Pulse party at the Lord Lindsey. Editors regret not showing up.

<HR>April, 1996 
<P>Metro Pulse founder and karaoke star Rand Pearson stuns the local publishing establishment when he accepts a position as general manager of the Reno News and Review. He breaks a long-baffling murder case when he overhears the confession of a darkly garbed male Caucasian: "I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die..." 

<P>The daring Dogwood Arts Festival parody is noticed by no one but the Dogwood Arts Festival, which quickly blackballs Metro Pulse from all its functions in retaliation. 

<H3><HR>August, 1996</H3> 
<P>Five years of hard work pays off when Metro Pulse is mentioned in the "Thanks to" paragraph on the credits of the V-Roys' debut CD, Just Add Ice. 


<H3><HR>More to Blame</H3>
<P>Here are even more people who played important roles in Metro Pulse's development (and about whom we couldn't think of anything funny to say).

<P><STRONG>James Raxter,</STRONG> misunderstood ad manager
<BR><STRONG>Carla Perkins,</STRONG> our first overworked business manager

<H2>Mercury Theatre </H2>
<STRONG>28 Market Square (downtown Knoxville) / (423) 637-8634</STRONG>
<BR>Open Tues. - Sun., with dance nights every Tues. and Sun. night.
<BR>Mercury Theatre hosts alternative bands the likes of Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Royal Trux, Archers of Loaf, Jawbox and Jonathan Fire*eater, as well as a plethora of local bands.
<BR>Evolving decor of outer space, wild west and skate punk themes. Decent beer prices and selection, reasonable covers. The bar area, including foosball tables, tends to be a "seen and be seen" hangout for local music luminaries. Dance night Sundays. Live rap with DJ Smooth Tuesdays. Parking is usually not a problem, since the huge lot behind the other side of Market Square is yours for the taking at night. Restrooms lack something to be desired, especially as the night runs on and the toilet paper runs out. Capacity 200.

<H2>Flamingo's</H2>
<STRONG>1836 Cumberland Ave. (on the Strip) / (423) 546-2323</STRONG>
<BR>Located in the heart of the campus of the University of Tennessee, Flamingo's stage features plenty of neo-hippie grooves and straight-forward Southern rock, as well as a smattering of commercial alternative bands (Letters To Cleo, Son Volt).
<BR>Flamingo's is not the most inviting or cozy room by any stretch of the imagination, but it serves its purpose with a capacity of 500. This is where you'll find the Spin Doctors/Dave Matthews Band/et al before they hit the big time. A real pitcher-of-beer kind of place; restaurant/deli/foosball tables downstairs. Restrooms acceptable. Parking a hassle. Located on the Strip, Flamingo's has about 3 parking spaces of its own in front; bank lot next door is usable, though. Otherwise, you've gotta scout out the Lake Avenue area.

<H2>Amigo's</H2>
<STRONG>116 S. Central Ave. (in the Old City) / (423) 546-9505</STRONG>
<BR>Blues, acoustic and a little bit of rock 'n' roll fit the bill at Amigo's, a Mexican restaurant and bar all wrapped up in one. Music every weekend, and upstairs performances (usually acoustic) are often free. Amigo's is also home to Knoxville's annual El Vez show, an event not to be missed.
<P>Nice restrooms; Typical Old City parking-- fend for yourself. Capacity 220, including restaurant.

<H2>Bombay Bicycle Club</H2>
<STRONG>6300 Papermill Rd. / (423) 584-0544</STRONG>
<BR>Dance nights Wed., Fri., and Sat. at 5pm, Sun. at 7.
<BR>Besides featuring popular dance nights, Bombay Bicycle Club is the place to see tribute bands of every shape and size, from Strutter (KISS) to Cowboys From Hell (Pantera), Heart-Shaped Box (Nirvana) to Downward Spiral (Nine Inch Nails, White Zombie and Rage Against the Machine). A new tribute every Thursday and occasional appearances by 70's rockers down on their luck. Plenty of bars, above average restrooms. Unfortunately, there are very few good vantage points, and, although there are parking lots on all sides of the building, they're often full. Capacity 500.

<H2>The Library</H2>
<STRONG>1910 Cumberland Ave. / (423) 546-0066</STRONG>
<BR>Straight-ahead, red-blooded rock 'n' roll is the call of the wild at The Library, located on the University of Tennessee campus. Music most every weekend, usually a mix of local and out-of-town bands. Bathrooms are acceptable. Capacity of 400 or so. No onsite parking; fend for yourself on the streets behind the club.

<P><HR><A NAME=honkytonks><IMG ALIGN=Middle SRC="hed_tonks.gif" ALT="Honky Tonks" WIDTH="110" HEIGHT="26"></A>

<H2>Judy's II</H2>
<STRONG>5916 Middlebrook Pike / (423) 584-3837</STRONG>
<BR>Country music is what you'll find at Judy's II, where it's non-stop
honky-tonk seven days a week. Capacity 150.

<H2>Cotton-Eyed Joe</H2>
<STRONG>11220 Outlet Dr. / (423) 675-4563</STRONG>
<BR>If boot-scootin' boogie is your thing, you'll want to check out
Cotton-Eyed Joe. Besides being Knoxville's line-dancing headquarters (30,000
square feet of dancing room) every single night of the week, Cotton-Eyed
Joe also features big-name live performances from the likes of George Jones
and Confederate Railroad. Lessons begin at 7 pm.

<H2>David's Music Barn</H2>
<STRONG>8625 Clinton Hwy. / (423) 945-3595</STRONG>
<BR>Located just outside the Knoxville city limits, David's Music Barn
is the place for colorful, downhome bluegrass.

<P><HR><A NAME=dance><IMG ALIGN=Middle SRC="hed_dance.gif" ALT="Dance Clubs" WIDTH="108" HEIGHT="26"></A>

<H2>The Carousel</H2>
<STRONG>1501 White Ave / (423) 522-6966</STRONG>

<H2>Lord Lindsey</H2>
<STRONG>W. Hill Ave. / (423) 522-2178</STRONG>
<BR>Shake it, baby, shake it, at The Closet, Lord Lindsey's weekly dance
adventure, as DJs spin the latest and greatest in underground grooves. Every
Thursday beginning 11 pm.

<H2>Michael's</H2>
<STRONG>7049 Kingston Pike / (423) 588-2455</STRONG>
<BR>Top 40 and baby boomers mix and mingle at Michael's every night
of the week. Sunday means "oldies."

<H2>Trump's</H2>
<STRONG>4541 Kingston Pike / (423) 584-4884</STRONG>
<BR>Definitely off the beaten path, Trump's features a high-energy dance
atmosphere and drag shows Mon-Sat. evenings.

<H2>Underground/Boiler Room</H2>
<STRONG>214 W. Jackson Ave / (423) 525-3675</STRONG>
<BR>The big daddy of dance, the Underground is a mulit-layered, cavernous
experience unto itself. An eclectic mix of Top 40 and techno is the specialty
of the house, known to be packed beyond breathing room most every weekend.
Truly underground, the Boiler Room is gonna make you sweat to the latest
in alternative dance beats, Fri. and Sat. 1 - 6am. The Underground fun begins
at 10 pm Mon., Wed., Fri. and Sat.

<H2>The Frog Pad</H2>
<STRONG>131 S. Central St. / (423) 971-3030</STRONG>
<BR>Dancehall and reggae raise the roof at The Frog Pad in the Old City, Tuesday is alternative night, Thursday is blues and bluegrass, and DJs spinning the latest Carib sounds every Wednesday. Capacity 180.

<H2>Sound Factory</H2>
<STRONG>125 E. Jackson Ave. 546-8500</STRONG>
<BR>Shake your groove thing, boys. Friday and Saturday beginning 10pm.

<P><HR><A NAME=jazzblues><IMG ALIGN=Middle SRC="hed_jazzblues.gif" ALT="Jazz and Blues" WIDTH="115" HEIGHT="26"></A>

<H2>Lucille's</H2>
<STRONG>106 S. Central St. (in the Old City) / (423) 546-3742</STRONG>
<BR>Lucille's, Knoxville's jazz mecca, is currently closed, but may reopen soon. We certainly hope so, anyway.

<H2>Ivory's</H2>
<STRONG>4715 Old Kingston Pike. (423) 588-6023.</STRONG>
<BR>318 N. Gay St. 423-637-9805More than just a piano bar, Ivory's lets local musicians sing the blues and more, .Mon. and Wed. - Sat.

<H2>Regas--The Gathering Place</H2>
<STRONG>318 N. Gay St. (423) 637-9805</STRONG>
<BR>A well-loved institution of a restaurant by day (recently voted the TK-best in the South by Southern Living magazine readers), Regas's bar turns into a hip little cabaret in the evening (Wed.-Sat.).

<P><HR><A NAME=neighborhood><IMG ALIGN=Middle SRC="hed_neighborhood.gif" ALT="Neighborhood Bars" WIDTH="171" HEIGHT="26"></A>

<H2>Sassy Ann's</H2>
<STRONG>820 N. Fourth Ave. / (423) 525-5839</STRONG>
<BR>Housed in a vintage Victorian in Knoxville's historic 4th and Gill
district, Sassy Ann's is a cozy restaurant and bar which just happens to
feature live blues six nights a week. A songwriter's night and open mic is
held every Sunday evening, with an open jam on Wednesdays. Capacity 80+.

<H2>Dante's</H2>
<STRONG>1801 Lake Ave. (One block behind Cumberland Ave.) (423) 525-3268</STRONG>
<BR>Dante's hosts bands both on the outside deck and by the bar.  Music goes from jazz/funk styles to neo-hippy. Covers are no more than $2. Extensive beer selection includes microbrews on tap and 75 imports. Food selections such as burgers, pizza and calzones. Capacity 150. 

<H2>Gryphon's</H2>
<STRONG>2003 Highland Ave. / (423) 524-6996</STRONG>
<BR>A combination
bar and laundromat, Gryphon's is open 24 hours, 7
days a week, and you can find just about any and everything here, from punk
to blues to acoustic folk. Lots of local bands get their start here, and
music is often free. Not for the faint of heart.

<H2>Hoo-Ray's</H2>
<BR><STRONG>106 S. Central St. / (423) 546-6729</STRONG><BR>Hoo-Ray's
is a larger-than-life sports bar extraordinaire located
in the heart of the historic Old City. Capacity 700.

<H2>Amsterdam Cafe</H2>
<STRONG>102 S. Central St. / (423) 523-2437</STRONG>
<BR>Small but cozy, Amsterdam Cafe is a bar with an
incredible beer selection in the Old City. Word of mouth, and foosball tables,
have made it a popular Gen-X hangout. You can find acoustic and plugged-in
rock and blues on the weekends and, sometimes, during the week, as well.

<H2>Hawkeye's</H2>
<STRONG>1717 White Ave. (423) 524-5326</STRONG>
<BR>A favorite of UT students and grads alike, Hawkeye's serves up American fare in a warm and inviting old house in Fort Sanders. Live music takes over upstairs Thurs.-Sat., making the already-packed bar a shoulder-to-shoulder affair. The real draw, though, is Animal Hour, an infamous and nightly 2-for-1 liquor happy hour.

<STRONG>Every year it happens</STRONG> just as it did the year before. March
looms
closer and closer, and with it our "Best of Knoxville" readers' poll. Teeth
gritted, shoulders squared, we confidently plan for it. This year, we vow
to ourselves, we'll figure it out so thoroughly, it'll be hardly any effort
at all. This means jury-rigged ballot-counting software. Eagle-eyed sentinels
on the lookout for stuffing. Legions of weak-fingered, data-entering staff
members dazedly staring at computer screens. "Count the ballots!" goes the
cry. "Count the ballots or die!" Still, we run out of time, racing against
the clock, slamming it all together just before we go to press. And so here
you have it: our annual compendium of who and what Knoxvillians love the
most. Wait until next year.

<H2><HR><A NAME=goods>GOODS AND SERVICES</A><HR>
</H2><P>
<H2>Best Comics Shop
</H2><P><STRONG>Collector's Choice</STRONG>
<P>With perennial winner Ziggy's Comics undergoing a buyout, name-change
and relocation, this longtime Strip fixture ascended the comics throne. And
it's not hard to see why--from action figures to role-playing games to all
the latest in comics and graphic novels, Collector's Choice has the goods
to give Knoxville's comics freaks and sci-fi geeks their fantasy fix.
<H2>Best Shoe Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Rack Room Shoes</STRONG>
<P>Oh, the smell of leather. Rack Room's got a lot of it...in every form
of sneaker, sandal, and slingback known to man. Their selection is superb.
Plus, if you're drooling on a sleek Maripe loafer that's way out of your
budget (even with Rack Room's low prices), the chances are pretty good they'll
have a lower-cost version not far down the aisle.
<H2>Best Thrift Store
</H2><P><STRONG>AmVets</STRONG>
<P>The granddaddy of Knoxville thrift stores, AmVets is the first-stop must
for thriftaholics on their weekly tour. Need a pair of two-dollar Levi's,
a sweater for 98 cents, a couch for 11 bucks? Dying for a camel coat (with
or without fur collar), a la Catherine Deneuve in Belle de Jour? AmVets is
the place. Holidays mean half-price sales, and you can't swing a dead cat
without hitting a hipster. True, you have to be willing to search for the
real treasures, but the expansive inventory is a virtual guarantee you'll
find something.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Goodwill, Salvation Army
<H2>Best Furniture Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Fowler's Furniture Center</STRONG>
<P>Ray Charles the Robot is still around, but he and his piano are shrouded
now in gold lam&eacute;, and you won't notice him as you enter Knoxville's
favorite furniture store. Ray isn't working at the moment, but Fowler's staff
has decorated around him with a scenario illustrating the current sales theme
("Back to the Future '96") that includes a female mannequin in a Christopher
Lloyd-style fright wig and white lab coat. Ray may be between sets, but acres
of showy living room, dining room and bedroom furniture remain. Fowler's
decorators haven't lost their sense of humor: On one upholstered piece, a
bottle of Gerber's baby food sits spilled--a shocker till you notice that
the pooling yellow puree is plastic.
<H2>Best Hair Salon
</H2><P><STRONG>Salon Visage</STRONG>
<P>We don't know what the name means, but we do know what this establishment
gives its customers--style, high fashion and the excitement of celebrity
connections (not to mention good haircuts). That's why it has retained its
top spot among our readers. Salon Visage has two locations, with a third
in the works near campus to foof the 'dos of coif-needy UT students.
<H2>Best Sporting Goods Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Knoxville Sports </STRONG>
<P>Bowling balls, badminton birdies, barbells, boxing gloves--if it has anything
to do with sports, you'll probably find it at this warehouse-sized store
in the Windsor Square shopping center. With prices and selection suited to
hardcore jocks and weekend warriors alike, Knoxville Sports stands head and
muscular shoulders above the competition.
<H2>Best Computer Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Eastern Computer </STRONG>
<P>Macs rock. Surely there can be no doubt about that. Why, the very magazine
you're holding in your hands was produced on a Mac. And where does one go
to get Macs but Eastern Computer? Sure, they also sell those IBM PC whatzits,
but Macs will always have a home (and a repair center) at Eastern. If RAM-envy
is the disease of the '90s, then the kindly folks at Eastern have the cure.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Circuit City, Office Depot
<H2>Best New Books Book Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Bookstar</STRONG>
<P>Once again, the titan of the west conquers all. They aren't the biggest
bookstore (the sheer mass of Books-a-Million probably grabs that honor),
and they aren't the choosiest in their selection (the book gourmands of
Davis-Kidd snag that). But they do offer an impressive combination of both
attributes, along with the most expansive and fun magazine rack in town.
And let's not forget that across-the-board hardcover discount.
<H2>Best Used Book Store
</H2><P><STRONG>McKay's Used Books</STRONG>
<P>Granted, the field of competition for this category is not large. But
more used book stores in Knoxville probably wouldn't threaten McKay's standing.
The selection is vast, to the point where it could just as easily be measured
in acreage as it could in the number of titles shelved. The service is
superlative by necessity, as their filing system is NASA-precise ("I'm sorry,
did you say 'Historical Novel' or 'Biographical Fiction?'"). And the new
locale suits the stacks just fine, with the also amply stocked compact disc-ery
finally under the same roof. What a wonderful world it would be if all steak
houses matured, like butterfly larvae, to become sizable used book stores.
<H2>Best CD Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Disc Exchange</STRONG>
<P>Sprawling shelves of low-priced new and used discs, now in two locations.
Where else but the Disc Exchange? And the ample selection isn't confined
to standard rock and country fare--both stores have healthy stocks of jazz,
blues, bluegrass, hip-hop, classical and New Age, as well as the latest in
indie cool. All this and posters, boxed sets, magazines, and the city's first
(and still best) listening bar. We dare you to walk in without walking out
with an enticingly priced new release or some unearthed eight-dollar gem.
<H2>Best Vinyl Record Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Lost &amp; Found</STRONG>
<P>Although a few of our readers are of the opinion that vinyl is dead--and
things admittedly are looking pretty bleak what with the closing of Landspeed
Records (see Best New Business)--Lost &amp; Found proves that, at the very
least, used vinyl is booming. The past year saw owners Mike and Maria Armstrong
expand the West Knoxville store to nearly twice its original size, without
losing any of its cozy, attic-like ambiance. Bursting at the seams with an
ever-changing stock of oldies but goodies, Lost &amp; Found has also increased
its inventory of alterna-hip releases and T-shirts, as well as used CDs and
cassettes. And we've got to give them much-deserved props for their championing
of the local music scene.
<EM>Close Runner Up:</EM> Landspeed Records
<H2>Best Musical Instruments Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Pick 'N' Grin</STRONG>
<P>With the flat-out best selection of used and vintage instruments in these
parts, it's no surprise that Pick 'N' Grin is the favorite. There's just
something about old wood which also makes music that makes a person feel
good all over. (If you haven't seen it already, stop by and check out the
sunburst Fender Starcaster they've got now. They just don't make them like
that anymore.) And for local pickers with old instruments, Pick 'N' Grin's
service department is like the family doctor.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Broadway Sound, Rob Payne Music Center
<H2>Best Video Rental Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Gemstone</STRONG>
<P>A clean, well-lighted place that somehow maintains security without making
you feel like a cow in a slaughterhouse. Convenience, a liberal selection,
a peppy staff, and three locations on Kingston Pike make Gemstone Knoxville's
once and current favorite video store.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Blockbuster, Evil Eye Video
<H2>Best Liquor Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Ashe's</STRONG>
<P>Once your mom comes to terms with the fact that you're old enough to drink
and that you enjoy it, she'll find comfort in the fact that, well, at least
you shop at Ashe's. As soon as you pass through those doors, you're treated
like a member of the Cox family. Whether you're looking for wine by the box
or one of those grand bottles older than the lads behind the counter, you'll
be counseled and guided as if you were shopping for a little something to
bring to dinner on the salesperson's patio tomorrow night, say, eight-ish.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> McScrooge's, Bob's
<H2>Best Pet Store
</H2><P><STRONG>SuperPetz</STRONG>
<P>Stretching out in the shell of a former grocery store, SuperPetz lives
up to its name with aisles and aisles of food, litter, toys, collars, brushes,
bowls, beds and every other pet accessory and accouterment you can imagine.
Basically, anything you might ever need or want for Fido, Fluffy, or even
a ferret is here. In fact, if you might need or want a ferret or a water
dragon or Siberian dwarf hamster, this is the place to go, too. SuperPetz
carries a large variety of reptiles and amphibians, birds, fish, rabbits,
rodents and more. And be sure to say hi to Zak, the store's four-foot-long
pet iguana. There's probably nothing here you haven't seen before, but the
sheer volume makes SuperPetz your one-stop pet shopping bonanza.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Adopt-A-Pet, Pet Patch, Pass Pets
<H2>Best Newsstand
</H2><P><STRONG>Chelsea Station</STRONG>
<P>Some bookstores in town may have a bigger selection of newspapers and
magazines, but Knoxville's favorite newsstand is Knoxville's only pure newsstand.
(We're big enough for at least one now--aren't we?) Approximately 3,000 miles
from Chelsea, but mere seconds away from the epicenter of the Old City, Chelsea
Station is convenient to late lurkers and coffee drinkers in need of a read.
<EM>Close Runner Up:</EM> Bookstar
<H2>Best Electronics Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Circuit City</STRONG>
<P>Not only is Circuit City Knoxville's Best Electronics Store, according
to our readers, it's the everything-est; the biggest, the loudest, the
flourescent-est, the most aggressive-est, you name it. The industrial
pallet-stacks of gear coupled with carnival-like bombardment of the senses
is made up for by the guys on the floor, however. They can tell you all you'd
ever want to know about integrated remotes, fiber optic capability, RAM doublers,
wireless headsets, and anything else that might need an extension cord or
batteries. Including why you need them.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Radio Shack, NOW
<H2>Best Health Food Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Nature's Pantry</STRONG>
<P>Whatever it takes to get the good stuff on the table, right? Nature's
Pantry has done an admirable job of selling a non-mainstream line of goods
and goodies (granted, it should be mainstream) to the masses by playing the
game. It only looks like a regular grocery; inside you'll find all the amaranth,
goldenseal and organic produce your body ever dreamed of. 
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> GNC, Food Co-Op
<H2>Best Bicycle Shop
</H2><P><STRONG>Bike Zoo</STRONG>
<P>You know they've got it down when they let the mechanics tear into your
bottom bracket right out there in front of you. Everybody in the Zoo has
bought bikes, most have raced them, and the salespeople and mechanics tend
to treat folks the way they'd like to be treated themselves. A bike is pretty
much a bike and your Tour de Frank Special tends to cost the same on one
end of town as it does on the other. Aside from yard sales, about the only
bike bargains happen in the way a shop does business and how hard they work
to get you to come back. No news to the folks at the Bike Zoo. 
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> West Hills, Interwheel, Harper
<H2>Best Gift Shop
</H2><P><STRONG>Andrew Morton</STRONG>
<P>As long as folks continue to get married, Andrew Morton will continue
to flourish as a place to go for wedding presents--and gifts for other big
occasions. The finest china, crystal, silverware, etc.: it's all there--and
if it isn't, Morton can probably procure it for you.
<H2>Best Antique Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Jackson Avenue Antiques</STRONG>
<P>Jackson Avenue Antiques is so big and complex you discover a whole new
wing every time you visit. And bring your watch--you can lose track of time
here. With a liberal approach to antiques that includes everything from rare
old furniture to exotic African sculpture to '80s pop collectibles, this
Old City warehouse is always like an intriguingly weird dream.
<H2>Best Car Dealer
</H2><P><STRONG>Toyota of Knoxville</STRONG>
<P>Why do we love Toyota of Knoxville so? It may be that they're selling
one of the most reliable cars ever produced. Then again, it could be the
honest and unassuming sales folks. Or maybe it's the quick and friendly service.
But, heck, we figure it's probably the nifty neon jumpin' guy who shimmies
his way up the side of the building on a nightly basis.
<EM>Close Runner Up:</EM> Airport Honda
<H2>Best Auto Repair Shop
</H2><P><STRONG>Buckner's</STRONG>
<P>The guys in the unassuming slate gray building on Sutherland Avenue have
made all the best assumptions of how to treat you right. Head mechanics Don
Buckner and Richard  Matthews take turns giving customers personal attention,
offering a thorough (but light on the techno-speak) explanation of what's
wrong with your set of wheels, foreign or domestic. Not only will they reassure
you that they'll do your repairs as cost efficiently as possible, but they
usually finish ahead of schedule. You'll be handed their business card on
your way out, too; they know it's not easy to separate yourself from your
money so they always try to make the split as amicable as possible.
<H2>Best Men's Clothing Store
</H2><P><STRONG>M.S. McClellan</STRONG>
<P>A locally owned haberdashery with locations downtown and in Bearden,
McClellan's shows full-grown men the way to manly dignity. As you walk in
the door, you suddenly feel nobler, taller, more handsome, better mannered,
and far cooler than you did in the car. Proper!
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Structure, Common Market, AmVets
<H2>Best Women's Clothing Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Talbots</STRONG>
<P>Casual but not too casual, dressy but not too dressy, Talbots has just
the kind of clothes that are perfect for the '90s. If they were being described
in a mail-order catalog, the proper appellation would be "urban casual."
Whatever. It's the kind of stuff that makes you look great and that you can
wear for both work and play.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Dillard's, Ann Taylor, Gap
<H2>Best Hip Clothing Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Jetta's</STRONG>
<P>Congratulations, Knoxville--you've finally ventured out of the mall. Tucked
away on Gay Street's trendy 100 block, Jetta's boasts a selection of super-coolie
hipster wear, from pink vinyl pants and baggy skater duds to used go-go boots
and one-of-a-kind neckties. New and used items for both men and women cohabit
peacefully, and the vintage goods have been carefully chosen with an obviously
adoring eye. (No missing buttons, out-of-place stitches or polyester runs.)
And Jetta's is probably the only place in town where you can pick up a gold
polyester shirt emblazoned with a decal of Peter Frampton, if you should
so desire.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Gap, AmVets
<H2>Best Fitness Club
</H2><P><STRONG>Court South</STRONG>
<P>Court South rules when it comes to the survival of the fittest. Their
three locations are self-contained calorie-burning, muscle-toning malls;
like terrariums for humans. The pool and weight rooms and squash courts and
indoor track all employ fairly traditional approaches to exercise. It's the
Cardiovascular Theatre--where folks jog/ cycle/ step it off while plugged
into a bank of video stimulation--that makes you wonder if we've gone too
far.
<H2>Best New Business
</H2><P><STRONG>Landspeed Records</STRONG>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="bok_newbiz.gif" WIDTH="94" HEIGHT="95" HSPACE="10">We
had planned
to write, triumphantly, about how Landspeed Records beat
the odds and the naysayers. After all, it sounded like a success story: two
twentysomethings with record store experience, knowledgeable vinyl fetishes
and unfettered enthusiasm open an indie vinyl boutique in, of all places,
downtown Knoxville. But the little-store-that-could may just have petered
out before it barely got going, due in part to local law enforcement stepping
in and putting a stop to the rock 'n' roll shows Landspeed hosted after hours.
Seems someone really does want to keep Gay Street quiet. And so 1996's Best
New Business comes to a grinding halt tomorrow, April 19. For how long, though,
we can't yet say--co-owner Lisa Morrow hints that a new, improved Landspeed
may re-open soon in a new location.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Charlie Peppers, All Night Eggplant, Blue Moon
Bakery
<H2><HR><A NAME=arts>ARTS &amp; ENTERTAINMENT</A><HR>
</H2><P>
<H2>Best Museum
</H2><P><STRONG>Knoxville Museum of Art</STRONG>
<P>Stand on the second floor of the Knoxville Museum of Art on a Friday evening,
with American Grandeur on one side of you, Julian Schnabel and "Chattering
Man" on the other, and live swing wafting up from Alive After Five--there's
not much else you need to know about the place or the people who run it.
Considering the diversity of the region the museum serves, they do a hell
of a job of filling the place, both with art and visitors.
<H2>Best Art Gallery
</H2><P><STRONG>Bennett Galleries</STRONG>
<P>For the third straight year, Knoxville art lovers love Bennett. And why
shouldn't they? The gallery carries a mighty fine roster of artists, many
of whom are local, and Marga Hayes and her staff know how to hang a room.
By this time next year, when they've crossed the Pike to the old Capri site,
Bennett Galleries will be the Space Mountain of boutiques. It's also good
to see that when Knoxvillians want to see some art, they know where to go
and patronize a broad range of sources. A-1 (all of four months old) and
the esteemed Tomato Head were popular runners-up.
<H2>Best Theater Troupe
</H2><P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="bok_theatregroup.gif" WIDTH="122" HEIGHT="82" HSPACE="10"><STRONG>Clarence
Brown Company</STRONG>
<P>With stunning sets and professional actors and directors from Knoxville
and around the globe, the Clarence Brown Company leads a dozen Knoxville-area
theater companies as our Best. Named after the UT grad who became a major
MGM director and producer, CBT has used Clarence Brown's millions in inheritance
well.
<EM>Close Runner Up:</EM> Theatre Central
<H2>Best Dance Troupe
</H2><P><STRONG>Tennessee Children's </STRONG>
<P>Dance Ensemble
This troupe from an unassuming studio on Sutherland Avenue is all many people
around the world know about Knoxville--leaving folks from Japan to Norway
a graceful impression we can only hope to deserve. The city's official goodwill
ambassadors to the world are all under 17, performing an astonishing variety
of modern and classical ballet on a par with professional troupes--in fact,
TCDE is a professional troupe, and the only one of its kind in the nation.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Circle Modern Dance, City Ballet
<H2>Best Movie Theater
</H2><P><STRONG>Terrace Theater</STRONG>
<P>The word is finally out: The Terrace is a gem. Smashing all
competitors--including those ever-popular dollar theaters--the small art
house swept the honor. With its concentration on independent, art, and foreign
films, the Terrace is the only place in town to see movies you previously
could only read about. So what if they're a few months behind the national
release dates? Or that the screen is usually only two-thirds in focus? Or
that they could use a new projector bulb with a little more wattage? The
Terrace is a theater of great potential--which it could reach with more of
your support.
<H2>Best Poetry Reading Venue
</H2><P><STRONG>Manhattan's</STRONG>
<P>One of the first restaurant/bars to open in the Old City, Manhattan's
unexpectedly developed a word-of-mouth reputation for poetry slams about
three years ago. With a genuine, brick-lined improv-style atmosphere (and
a usually supportive crowd)--and, perhaps, most importantly, cold beer on
tap--Manhattan's on Tuesday night is still our favorite venue. Other places
in town are daring enough to feature open poetry readings--but we'd rather
hear the best and worst of local verse here.
<H2>Best Local Actor
</H2><P><STRONG>David Keith</STRONG>
<P>Hey--forget what we said before. David Keith is hot. Putting his
straight-to-video B-movies behind him, Keith is back in the Hollywood game,
playing with the big guys. Hot off his commendable turn in The Indian in
the Cupboard, Keith is now starring in his own cop series High Incident,
produced by none other than DreamWorks SKG (that's Spielberg-Katzenberg-Geffen).
He's looking trim and seems to be shaving more often. And there's nothing
we media weasels like more than a comeback kid.
<H2>Best Actress
</H2><P><STRONG>Patricia Neal</STRONG>
<P>Thirty years after the stroke that almost ended her career, and almost
60 years after she first walked the boards in local productions, Knoxville-raised
Patricia Neal is still our favorite. Maybe it's all her great movies now
out on video, from The Fountainhead, opposite Gary Cooper, to The Day the
Earth Stood Still opposite a killer robot from another planet. (Is that really
the same woman?) Whether she's still local, more than a half-century after
she left town, is another question. But we'll give her the benefit of the
doubt one more time. At 70, she does occasionally visit her dandy rehabilitation
center, attached to Fort Sanders Hospital.
<H2>Best Local Artist
</H2><P><STRONG>Jim Gray</STRONG>
<P>A jazz writer once tried to bait the too-hip jazzman Thelonious Monk into
belittling man of the people Lawrence Welk. Monk said simply, as if in
admiration, "The man's got a good gig." Jim Gray's got a good gig. He knows
what the people want, how to put it in a frame, and where they're going to
look for it. Hope springs eternal in artists close behind the gifted Mr.
Gray: Robert Tino, Cynthia Markert, Jan Lynch and Wade Guyton all finished
in the pack.
<H2>Best Drag Queen
</H2><P><STRONG>Shannon DeVaughn</STRONG>
<P>She's beautiful. She's blonde. She's brassy. She's a boy. Although she
departed the Carousel, that sprawling den of androgyny in Fort Sanders, for
the smaller, posher Trump's in Bearden, Knoxville's favorite gender-blending
bombshell proved once again that it's never a drag to be in drag.
<H2><HR><A NAME=people>PEOPLE</A><HR>
</H2><P>
<H2>Best Local Athlete
</H2><P><STRONG>Peyton Manning</STRONG>
<P>Let's see--the Heisman candidate quarterback on a national championship
contender... Nah, who'da thunk it? Of course, our boy Peyton isn't actually
a Knoxville native, but we can probably look the other way just this once.
Especially if he brings home that little bronze statue with the outstretched
arm.
<H2>Best Local Philanthropist
</H2><P><STRONG>Jim Haslam</STRONG>
<P>Whenever a worthy cause in town is seeking money, the path leads to James
Haslam II's doorstep. The Pilot Corp. chairman is not only one of the most
munificent men in town (along with runner-up Jim Clayton), he's also the
city's premier fund raiser. "This is Jim Haslam, and I need your help" is
a signature phone call that usually gets a signed check in response.
<H2>Best Unsung Hero
</H2><P><STRONG>Stephen Smith</STRONG>
<P>"The way I see it," says Second District Congressional candidate Dr. Stephen
Smith, "everybody has a toolbox when it comes to making a difference. Sometimes
the right tool for the job is a pen. You reach in and grab your pen and write
a letter to your congressman. Sometimes the right tool for the job is a suit.
You put on your suit and you go to Washington." Next time you see Smith,
he'll most likely be in a suit, doing his best to get you to send him to
Washington. With an impressive career in grassroots activism, the veterinarian/
environmentalist is confident that he'll make a better congressman than the
landmark he'll have to beat to become one. Readers who responded hailed Smith
as an Unsung Hero for reasons ranging from his environmental work (at the
Foundation for Global Sustainability and the Tennessee Valley Energy Reform
Coalition) and the simple fact that he's willing to represent the district
for which he so obviously cares.
<H2>Best Local Sex Symbol
</H2><P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="bok_sex.gif" WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="107" HSPACE="10"><STRONG>Chuck
Hudson</STRONG>
<P>Hudson, the manager of Charlie Pepper's on the Cumberland Strip, no doubt
has his share of secret admirers who must watch as he hustles hot food, cold
drinks, staff and customers into a harmonious whole. Now, let the world
know.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<H2>Best Local Politician
</H2><P><STRONG>Victor Ashe</STRONG>
<P>Best politician (is that an oxymoron?) is, of course, none other than
Mayor Victor Ashe. Fresh off an election year where he left another opponent
to eat his dust, Ashe, who used to say he hoped he'd be the last mayor Knoxville
ever has, is heading into the year when the voters will decide whether to
grant him his alleged wish by approving consolidated government. The wily
Ashe is leaving his options open.
<H2>Best Hair Stylist
</H2><P><STRONG>Frank Gambuzza, Salon Visage</STRONG>
<P>Every town has its hairdressing star: one (usually) man who women rave
about, pledge their undying allegiance to, brave traffic and month-long waits
to get to. In Knoxville, that man is one Frank Gambuzza, owner and operator
of Salon Visage and coiffeur visionary extraordinaire. He's East Tennessee's
answer to Vidal Sassoon.
<H2>Best Waiter/Waitress
</H2><P><STRONG><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="bok_waitress.gif" WIDTH="86" HEIGHT="89" HSPACE="10">Sara
Lowe, Ye Olde Steak House</STRONG>
<P>Knoxville's favorite server is Sara Lowe, who has worked at Ye Olde Steak
House for 20 years. She is fast, efficient, friendly and sold on her product.
"My cooks make me look good," she says modestly. She wouldn't eat a steak
anywhere else, and says she's crazy about the homemade desserts, especially
the chocolate ones. On the home front, she's married to that famously political
firefighter, Kenneth "Red" Lowe, who says Sara is a patient and forgiving
woman.
<H2>Best Bartender
</H2><P><STRONG>Seth Severns, Smoky Mountain Brewing Company</STRONG>
<P>Garrulous Severns, bartender for the late, lamented Smoky Mountain Brewing
Company, won in this hot contest in a crowded field in which a few votes
make a big difference. Severns tended, ardently but all too briefly, the
most extravagant bar ever built in East Tennessee. Severns's friendly honesty
about the pub's best and second-best experiments earned the respect of patrons.
Fortunately, this chemistry major diversified his career: Playing guitar
on stage with the punk 'n' roll State Champs, he's known as Johnny Turbo.
<H2>Best Local Writer
</H2><P><STRONG>Jack Neely</STRONG>
<P>Author William Styron once said (in a Metro Pulse interview, no less)
that a great writer needs a Mighty Theme. Metro Pulse's secret historian
fits the bill. Knoxvillians found resonance (and maybe a sense of identity)
in Neely's thoughtful vignettes and affably elegant prose, and he resoundingly
out-polled two-time winner Sam Venable of That Other Paper. We were going
to recommend that you pick up a copy of Knoxville's Secret History at your
local bookstore, but it looks like you already have.
<H2><HR><A NAME=places>PLACES</A><HR>
</H2><P>
<H2>Best Tourist Attraction
</H2><P><STRONG>Smoky Mountains</STRONG>
<P>Best Tourist Attraction is a difficult, almost oxymoronic, concept when
you live near those places under consideration. It's like "Shortest Tall
Guy." But hey, if enough people are convinced that tourists are coming here
to see the Smokies and leaving behind lots of dough, well, just maybe, the
governor's office will begin to look at them as a business. And then, just
maybe, it will stop generating regulations that favor smokestack polluters
over the mountains. Dare to dream.
<H2>Best Place to Watch People
</H2><P><STRONG>West Town Mall</STRONG>
<P>With the addition of about a zillion square feet full of eminently buyable
stuff, West Town Mall has truly become a retail mecca, sounding its siren
call to shoppers from Crossville to Lexington, from Chattanooga to Johnson
City. And what does that translate into but even more superb people-watching
opportunities? So get a frosty Diet Coke and a steaming hot Cinnabun, and
settle in for a good settin' spell at the food court . You'll have the finest
front row seats to East Tennessee's non-stop (well, from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.)
parade of semi-diversity.
<H2>Best Park
</H2><P><STRONG>Sequoyah Hills Park (Cherokee Boulevard)</STRONG>
<P>It's a rare case of social justice that Knoxville's most prestigious address
is also our most popular public park. On a hot Sunday afternoon, the two-mile
long Sequoyah Hills Park along Cherokee Boulevard is Knoxville's Venice Beach,
thick with volleyballers, term-paper writers, Frisbee footballers, martial
artists, walkers of retired racing dogs, and slightly tipsy golfers (hey!
watch it!). But it's still big enough to get away and sit under your own
private willow with a book of Wordsworth.
<H2>Best Bowling Alley
</H2><P><STRONG>Family Bowl</STRONG>
<P>Is there any doubt we're currently in a bowling renaissance? Sure, let
those other health-niks climb rocks and ride bicycles to Arizona; bowling
is the athletic sport of the masses. And where better to slam some pins than
at Family Bowl, which offers rockin' tunes, American beers and fine fried
potato snacks? 
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Western Plaza, Fountain Lanes
<H2>Best Golf Course
</H2><P><STRONG>Deane Hill</STRONG>
<P>Unfortunately, our readers' favorite course--newly opened to the public
last year--is no more. Now closed and awaiting redevelopment into yet more
shopping/ living space out west, Deane Hill rests unplayed upon. Can't wait
for those mini-plazas!
<H2>Best Tennis Courts
</H2><P><STRONG>Tyson Park</STRONG>
<P>LOVE ALL! That's not a tennis score; it's the dominant emotion Knoxvillians
feel for the tennis center at Tyson Park. The city courts in the shadow of
Alcoa Highway remain the city's favorite place to foot fault, rush the net,
pull off a passing shot and occasionally ace the competition.
<H2><HR><A NAME=food>FOOD &amp; DRINK</A><HR>
</H2><P>(Ed. Note: Although we asked voters to specify the location when
voting for a chain restaurant, not many did. Therefore, in order to be fair
to restaurants with only one location and lacking in million-dollar marketing
budgets, we divided total votes by the number of locations in town for each
chain.)
<H2>Best Grocery &amp; Best Bakery
</H2><P><STRONG>Fresh Market</STRONG>
<P>It's the little things that bring them back: free coffee, free pizza samples,
fresh ground sausage sculpted into the shape of its porcine source. Jesting
aside, Fresh Market is consistently well-stocked with good things that were
damn hard to get around here before they hung their shingle over the Pike.
We may now happily take imported pastas, real Belgian kreik, peppered
ch&egrave;vre and custom ground Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee for granted.

On the bakery side, things may soon heat up a bit. Open for all of one month
when these ballots were tallied, Blue Moon Bakery &amp; Cafe, on Central,
finished on the heels of Fresh Market (trailing by precisely one vote). Business
analysts are always coming off with that line about competition being good
for everybody involved--it finally seems believable when it's between two
good bakeries, one on either side of town.
<H2>Best Middle Eastern Restaurant
</H2><P><STRONG>Falafel Hut</STRONG>
<P>Falafel Hut is one of the few remaining reasons to rationalize living
in Fort Sanders. We're talking fresh and authentic Middle Eastern fare--from
your baba ganoush to tabbouleh and everything in between--at prices way better
than fair. And it's hard to beat their beer selection when it comes to washing
it all down. 
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> King Tut's, Fatoosh, Olive Tree, Dad's
<H2>Best Sports Bar
</H2><P><STRONG>Hoo-Rays</STRONG>
<P>Hugh Ray Wilson owns Knoxville's best sports bar, the eponymous Hoo-Rays.
He jokes that he, ergo the bar, acquired the name because he was born at
Baptist Hospital within earshot of Neyland Stadium, and all his mother could
hear was fans hollering "hoo-ray." Hoo-Rays features a gallery of glassy-eyed
taxidermy downstairs, a dance floor and a private club up. The memorabilia
includes an orange tuxedo in a glass case bearing the sign "In case of Sugar
Bowl break glass." Celebrity-watchers can cop glimpses of visiting sports
bigwigs, including Archie Manning on home game weekends.
<H2>Best Breakfast
</H2><P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="bok_ihop.gif" WIDTH="108" HEIGHT="73" HSPACE="10"><STRONG>IHOP</STRONG>
<P>No question about it: West Knox stand-by International House of Pancakes
serves up the finest hangover helper in this town. And even sober, the grub's
pretty darn good--there's a nice variety of pancakes for all you fruits and
nuts out there, and a menu of all-American standards like grilled cheese,
sirloin patties, and rib-sticking vegetable soup. For breakfast--even if
breakfast means 2 a.m.--it simply can't be beat.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Cracker Barrel, Shoney's, Waffle House
<H2>Best Coffee,
Best Coffee House,
Best Desserts
</H2><P><STRONG>Java</STRONG>
<P>What's in a name? Java has what you need and they make it consistently
well. No fluff or distractions, aside from naturally sublime coffee drinking
settings: Central Avenue, in the Old City, and now Homberg Place, way out
west. The desserts are, simply and truly, among the best in the world. Peggy
Hambright's Mag-Pies kitchen (soon to be found on Market Square, sharing
kitchen space with Tomato Head) and local baker Judy Mixon turn out incredibly
fine sweets, from Mom's kitchen traditionals to decadent exotica.
<H2>Best Sunday Brunch
</H2><P><STRONG>Copper Cellar</STRONG>
<P>Knoxville's favorite spot for apr&egrave;s (or in lieu of) church dining
remains the Copper Cellar, where they have Sunday brunch down to a science.
From custom omelets to biscuits and gravy to smoked salmon and capers, the
Copper Cellar will satiate your every desire (and guarantee the need for
a long Sunday afternoon nap).
<H2>Best Appetizers
</H2><P><STRONG>Friday's</STRONG>
<P>One of Knoxville's finest pick-up spot also happens to serve up the best
appetizers in town--kick-ass potato skins, scrumptious chicken satay, whompin'
Oriental dumplings, etc. But as you're washing the fine fare down with a
cold one, ponder this: What exactly are they whetting your appetite for?
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Copper Cellar, Charlie Peppers, Silver Spoon,
Sunspot
<H2>Best Pizza
,Best Salads,
Best Lunch Spot
</H2><P><STRONG>Tomato Head</STRONG>
<P>Tomato Head puts more different toppings on pizza than your parents ever
wanted you to know about. Mahasti and company make Knoxville's best pizza,
no question in the minds of those who have to call for reservations on weekends.
That category wasn't even close. But with outdoor tables on a sunny day and
a newly expanded, remodeled interior that reveals the original Edwardian
stamped-tin ceiling and polished hardwood floors--plus interesting background
music and cozy first-name-basis customer service, it's also our favorite
lunch spot, edging out Sunspot by only a few votes. And in the Best Salads
category, Mater Noggin's Caesar and pasta salads --which always make you
wonder why you can't fix something that tastes that fresh at home--slipped
by Silver Spoon by exactly one vote.
<H2>Best Delivered Pizza
</H2><P><STRONG>Stefano's</STRONG>
<P>With its distinctively thick, bread-like "Chicago style" crust--and, unlike
some pizza delivery chains, no rumored political agenda--campus institution
Stefano's Pizza wins the prize.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Papa John, Pizza Hut, Domino's
<H2>Best Wings
</H2><P><STRONG>BW3</STRONG>
<P>The charms of BW3 cannot be underestimated. There's the rowdy atmosphere,
the surly bouncers, the attitudinal bartenders, the interactive trivia game,
the pool tables. Add all that to the perfect finger-licking delicious wings,
and you've got the very definition of a great bar/hangout.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Spicy's, Hooters
<H2>Best Steak House
</H2><P><STRONG>Ye Olde Steak House</STRONG>
<P>When it comes to steak, Knoxville doesn't mess around. We like our charred
flesh fresh, flavorful and straight up, please--no sissy sauces or seasoning
to detract from the visceral experience. That explains, then, why we're so
crazy about Ye Olde Steak house, a haven for steak purists on Chapman Highway.
Perhaps owing to the fine food, the brown-bagging policy, the celebratory
atmosphere, it's become a Knoxville tradition--one with compulsory post-football-
game attendance.
<H2>Best Soups
</H2><P><STRONG>The Soup Kitchen</STRONG>
<P>Concentrate on one thing, but be the very best. With a different selection
of eight soups every day, from the thick to the thin, the tomato-based to
the cream, the old standby to the slightly bizarre (not to mention great
fresh-baked bread)--plus a comfortably low-key cafeteria-style arrangement
that leaves us unpestered by waitresses and checks--longtime Market Square
landmark the Soup Kitchen won this one without a contest.
<H2>Best Deli,
Best Sandwiches
</H2><P><STRONG>Harold's</STRONG>
<P>For fatalists convinced that Gay Street is cursed, Harold's remains the
stickiest rebuttal. Postponing his retirement until further notice, Harold
Shersky has been there nearly 50 years--and as neighboring businesses wax
and wane, you're often lucky to find a seat at Harold's at lunchtime (not
to mention Saturday mornings). Our original deli remains our best, with kosher
classics and some sandwich concoctions of his own, like the pumpernickel
Reuben, the Giant Twist, and the inimitable Gilbert. It's also still a real
delicatessen (that's what deli used to stand for, kids) where you can buy
the corned beef, herring, and pickled tomatoes by the pound: the raw materials
of kosher cuisine. A meal at Harold's is the single fastest way to get to
know Knoxville at its complicated best.
<H2>Best Hamburger
</H2><P><STRONG>Litton's</STRONG>
<P>Surprise, surprise, surprise! Why--we can hardly believe it--Litton's
 won our best burger category! Who'da thunk it...well, besides EVERYBODY?
Litton's is a Knoxville original, an institution. Look up "hamburger joint"
in the American Heritage 1996 edition illustrated dictionary, and you'll
see a picture of Litton's. Really.
<H2>Best Hot Dogs
</H2><P><STRONG>"The Sabrett Vendor"</STRONG>
<P>We may not know his name, but we like him, anyway. Seemingly ubiquitous
(didn't we just see him in the Old City?) this purveyor of hot dogs that
are so good you don't call them hot dogs makes UT football games and other
occasions smell much better than they used to. (Sabrett franks is the proper
terminology for these delicately spiced sausages.) The folks at Zosha's Ukrainian
cafe near Market Square (which also serves Sabrett's and got some votes on
its own) run the Sabrett's concession. Walking around in Knoxville crowds
has never smelled and tasted so good. His name, by the way, is Vinny.
<H2>Best Barbecue
</H2><P><STRONG>Corky's</STRONG>
<P>The race was tight in the 'cue category (the choice of the masses is still
Buddy's, natch), but Corky's managed to win by a nose--or was it a snout?
Corky's tender, smoky-sweet Memphis-style ribs have earned their devoted
following. And they've become Knoxville's favorite culinary "sin."
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Calhoun's, Sarge's
<H2>Best Seafood
</H2><P><STRONG>Chesapeake's</STRONG>
<P>The completion of the "tunnel" connecting downtown to the interstate may
have turned Chesapeake's back door into its front door, but Knoxville's favorite
seafood restaurant hasn't suffered at all. From its incomparable grilled
swordfish to its signature spinach Maria, Chesapeake's still scratches the
city's itch for outstanding seafood. A comfortable ambiance with topnotch
service.
<H2>Best Buffet
</H2><P><STRONG>Mandarin House</STRONG>
<P>You know they've got the best buffet in Knoxville, because their omnipresent
billboards scream it out: "Voted Best in Knoxville!" They never bother to
say by whom, but we'll let you in on a little secret: it's none other than
Metro Pulse readers who have elevated Mandarin House to best-of status. So
next time you line up for an egg roll, tell 'em where you saw them honored.
<H2>Best Beer Selection
</H2><P><STRONG>Amsterdam Cafe</STRONG>
<P>To win this one, we think you've got to start with Guiness and Bass on
tap--two halves of the classic black-and-tan. Amsterdam has that and a whole
lot more. With a lengthy row of tasty draught flavors and more domestic and
import bottles than you can shake a frosty mug at, Amsterdam Cafe has ridden
a frothy wave of success behind that once-jinxed storefront at the corner
of Central and Jackson.
<H2>Best Wine List
</H2><P><STRONG>Orangery</STRONG>
<P>Winning by a mere vote over the always popular Naples, the Orangery retains
its prize for another year. The folks who choose the wine at the Orangery
understand that much of their clientele consider the drink to be as important
as the food, and it shows.
<H2>Best Vegetarian Menu
</H2><P><STRONG>Sunspot</STRONG>
<P>Okay, so the menu isn't strictly vegetarian. Still, Sunspot offers a wide
variety of vegetarian and vegan specialties to please the most finicky of
P.C. palates, with all-veg specials every day. From pastas to veggie burgers
to stir fries to stews, there's something for everyone who's feeling a bit
in the "vegetable way." And its all served in a cozy, urbane atmosphere that
will undoubtedly keep you coming back for more. 
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Tjaarda's, All Night Eggplant, Tomato Head, Falafel
Hut
<H2>Best Italian Restaurant, Best Romantic Atmosphere
</H2><P><STRONG>Naples</STRONG>
<P>Naples has always had a special place in the hearts of Knoxvillians, who
have long appreciated its romantic atmosphere, delicious Italian cuisine,
and reasonable prices. It is the kind of restaurant where memories are made--and
we're not just saying that. If you haven't been there yet, go now. And keep
this rule in mind: the nightly special is always worth a taste. And for maximum
romantic effect, you can always share it between two, Lady and the Tramp-style.
'At's Amore!
<H2>Best Diner
</H2><P><STRONG>The Diner</STRONG>
<P>So it's not a classic diner, in the greasy-spoon sense of the word
(geez--didn't anyone see our tribute to local diners in our Restaurant Guide?).
Instead, The Diner is an art-deco wonder that serves up not only great hamburgers
(it was Litton's love child, remember) but some wholly respectable
continental-style cuisine. Believe it or not, their Boston scrod rivals even
Regas's classic King Georges standard. And the mustard-marinated pork loin
is out of this world.
<H2>Best Asian Restaurant
</H2><P><STRONG>Stir Fry Cafe</STRONG>
<P>It just is. Stir Fry Cafe is a wonderful restaurant offering Knoxville
palates the tongue-tantalizing, tempting spicy cuisine of the far East. Their
Chinese specialties are top rate, but it's the Thai food that keeps us coming
back for more. Their pad thai is to die for, their curries divine, and their
soups guaranteed to clear up any nasal congestion in only one sip. With its
live music on the weekends, and its location right next to Bookstar, it's
a primo date destination.
<H2>Best Mexican Restaurant
</H2><P><STRONG>La Paz</STRONG>
<P>Go ahead and take the plunge on the extra-hot sauce when they bring out
the tortilla chips; the busboy makes it his special mission to keep your
water glass filled. And that's just the first of many indulgences when you
sit down at La Paz, from the zingy zapnins to the flavorful fajitas to the
magnificent margaritas. Even with the ever-increasing number of
south-of-the-border specialty restaurants, this jazzy little hole in Suburban
Center remains at the top of the heap.
<H2>Best Brewpub
</H2><P><STRONG>The Smoky Mountain Brewery</STRONG>
<P>Sad to say, our first brewpub, and still our favorite, closed indefinitely
just as y'all were sending us ballots. With its "private" cigar-and-Scotch
lounge and huge mahogany bar, no saloon in modern Knoxville was ever as
extravagant--and, to a loyal several, as beloved--in its mere 19 months of
camaraderie, comfort, and very good beer. But the Mill, our second-place
finisher, still thrives, as does Calhoun's, an honorable third.
<H2>Best Bagel Shop
</H2><P><STRONG>New York Bagel Shop and Deli</STRONG>
<P>For breakfast, lunch and dinner, bagels are the Everymeal, and Knoxvillians
are jumping on the wagon like never before. If you want proof, just try going
into either of the New York Bagel Shop's locations between noon and 2 p.m--just
be ready and willing to elbow your way up to the case displaying at least
a dozen different flavors, including the ever-popular "everything." And,
after all, what more could you ask for?
<H2>Best Cafeteria
</H2><P><STRONG>S &amp; S Cafeteria</STRONG>
<P>When Mom's out of pocket (or just out of sorts), many Knoxvillians turn
to one of the city's two S &amp; S cafeterias for supper or Sunday dinner--roast
beef, ham, chicken, fish, and a selection of vegetables that should satisfy
even the most picky four-year-old. Whether you go to the old-fashioned version
on the western edge of Sequoyah Hills or the one with the trendy decor near
Cedar Bluff, you're sure to see someone you know getting home cooking without
going home.
<H2>Best Happy Hour
</H2><P><STRONG>Hawkeye's </STRONG>
<P>It's more than just the three-for-one "Animal Hour" every weeknight from
9 to 10 p.m. (although that's a big part of it.) There's also a certain
intangible essence, a suncity, rustic ambiance that invites frat boys, hippies
and yuppies alike to mingle, raise a toast and groove hip-to-hip on cool
blues sounds from any number of crack local bands that regularly grace the
upstairs bar.
<H2>Best Ribs
</H2><P><STRONG>Calhoun's</STRONG>
<P>Laying waste to the competition is Mike Chase's hometown champ, Calhoun's.
Despite all the challengers, whether they be from Memphis or Jamaica, Calhoun's
Knox-style ribs win again with the locals. So get a table with a river view
(or of Kingston Pike, if you want some micro-brew) and order a side in salute.
<H2>Best New Restaurant
</H2><P><STRONG>Romano's Macaroni Grill</STRONG>
<P>The general rule of Knoxville restaurant-going is this: if it's new, we
like it. But as it starts to age--after, say, a few months--fickleness starts
to set in, and it's on to the next new restaurant. Romano's Macaroni Grill,
however, is still hot months after its long-awaited opening, swarming with
people nearly all the time. For some, its scripted banter and meticulously
designed atmosphere is a bit too artificial, but for most Knoxvillians it
still feels fresh. Long may its plates accidentally smash.

</H2><P>
<H2>Best Local Bluegrass Band
</H2><P><STRONG>Susie Betts &amp; The Smokin' O's</STRONG>
<P>You can thank the former bluegrass hot spot, Marcus' Pizza, for this
conglomeration. Formed almost two years ago to take the stage in Fountain
City, the Smokin' O's features singer and guitar picker Betts, backed up
by Dobro dazzler Phil Leadbetter (whose "day" job involves the same instrument,
played behind bluegrass master J. D. Crowe), Albert Styles on guitar, and
Mark Brooks on double bass. Separately, you're apt to catch these pickers
all over: Betts charms tourists by the score down at Uncle Bud's Catfish
in Pigeon Forge, and Styles and Brooks both hang their hats at Dollywood.
Together, your best chance to hear them will be this summer on the deck at
Charlie Pepper's. Their specialty is progressive 'grass, so don't set your
heart on "Uncle Pen" or "Barefoot Nellie."
<H2>Best Local Jazz Band
</H2><P><STRONG>Jazz Liberation Quartet </STRONG>
<P>Even with departure of guitarist and scene fixture Dave Nichols (who literally
ran off to join the circus), JLQ kept the zing in its swing, entertaining
jazz and rock fans alike with an off-kilter mix of corrupted bop, fusiony
rock and low-down fonk. If you haven't seen JLQ lately, then you haven't
seen JLQ.
<H2>Best Local Blues Band
</H2><P><STRONG>Crawdaddy </STRONG>
<P>Although Knoxville's best blues band isn't just a blues band, they imbue
their reggae, rock, soul and R&amp;B covers and originals with a certain
blues verity. Lest you doubt, go watch Michael Crawley and Co. set butts
a-shakin' at Hawkeye's on a Thursday night, and see if it doesn't conjure
images of a crowded Delta juke joint after a day in the cotton fields. Between
Crawley's blazing harp and guitarist Detroit Dave's manic splatter, these
boys got the mojo working.
<H2>Best Local Rock Band
</H2><P><STRONG>Superdrag</STRONG>
<P>Knoxville's Fab Four had quite a whirlwind year: getting swept up by a
major label; releasing an acclaimed indie album (The Fabulous Eight-Track
Sounds of Superdrag   on Darla Records); touring the country with buzz bands
and indie stalwarts the likes of Letters to Cleo, Echobelly, and Archers
of Loaf; recording with cooler-than-thou producer Tim (Sebadoh, Belly) O'Heir;
playing shows in front of such celebrity types as Drew Barrymore and Johnny
Rotten; and garnering glowing profiles in Raygun, Alternative Press, College
Music Journal, Melody Maker and other esteemed rock publications.
With their Elektra Records debut Regretfully Yours still fresh on the shelves,
it remains to be seen whether they're going to put us on the map (reviews
have been mighty positive, though, including a recent A-minus in Entertainment
Weekly), but one thing's for sure: Knoxville loves them.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> State Champs, Thumbnail
<H2>Best Local Acoustic Band

<P>The perennial Old City favorites win over the masses with their gentle
takes on acoustic classics and their own originals.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Sara Lite, Crawbaby, Atom Bomb Pocketknife
<H2>Best Local R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Band
</H2><P><STRONG>L.I.F.E.</STRONG>
<P>YO! Straight outta K-town comes L.I.F.E., those ever phresh, phat, phunky
rap 'n' rollers who made the cut for the Music Association of Knoxville Showcase
this year. They've added another accolade by winning as best hip-hop act,
proving they're, yes, "down" with Knoxville audiences.
<H2>Best Country Band
</H2><P><STRONG>The V***roys</STRONG>
<P>A.k.a. the Viceroys. Are they rock 'n' roll or country? We've apparently
decided the wildmen in ties are the latter. Now going by the copyright-mandated
alias, V-Roys, they're off on a tour of England with Steve Earle, and their
own CD is due for international release this summer.
<H2>Best Male Vocalist
</H2><P><STRONG>Justin Sinkovich </STRONG>
<P>Knoxville doesn't mind a little grit and venom in its vocalists. The
downy-cheeked 23-year-old patriarch of the city's newest wave of punk rockers
won handily over such contenders as smooth-crooning John Davis of Superdrag
and the lonesome-wailing Scott Miller of the Viceroys (the pleasantly raspy
Michael Crawley also fared well.) Cargo/Headhunter Records must have agreed
with your choice; that California bastion of indie hipness signed Sinkovich's
progressive punk Thumbnail to a contract in late '95. You can hear Sinkovich
exercise the more sensitive side of his chords when he fronts his other band,
rattle-pop trio Atom Bomb Pocket Knife.

</H2><P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="bok_release.gif" WIDTH="108" HEIGHT="93" HSPACE="10"><STRONG>Nancy
Brennan Strange,
Les Etoiles Mysterieuse</STRONG>
<P>Nancy Brennan Strange deserves recognition for many things. Over the past
two and a half decades she's done wonderful things in and around Knoxville
in the forms of folk music, storytelling, cultural and historical arts, and
most recently jazz. Last year she released a lovely compact disc, Les Etoiles
Mysterieuse(Strange Stars), which features an orchestra of Knoxville's jazz
elite. She mentioned then that she was grateful for the local jazz venues,
such as Alive After Five and Lucille's, which allow her to sing often without
relocating to more musical but less pleasant environs like New York. Strange
is one of many who return the favor to local folks who wish to hear fine
music and prefer to do it here.
<H2>Best Songwriter
</H2><P><STRONG>Scott Miller</STRONG>
<P>Solo, leading an acoustic trio, or fronting the Viceroys, the skinny kid
from the Shenandoah Valley is our favorite songwriter, author of over 100
good songs, including "Goodnight, Loser," "Lie I Believe," and his solo
"Napoleon" which appears on a recent Bubbapalooza compilation CD--whether
you think he looks like Hank Senior or not.
<H2>Best Church Choir
</H2><P><STRONG>Sacred Heart Cathedral Choir</STRONG>
<P>Under the leadership of director Donna Swan (don't tell anyone she's actually
an Episcopalian) and organist Robert McCarter, this group of 30-odd people
sings for the Sunday 10:30 a.m. Mass; and the cathedral's women's choir sings
for the 6 p.m. Saturday service. The group is ambitious; their Easter season
repertoire included Faur&eacute;'s Requiem this year.
<H2>Best Rock Club
</H2><P><STRONG>Mercury Theater </STRONG>
<P>It's not too big and it's not too small, it's got a decent beer selection
and it's agreeably dive-ish. The decor is trendy in a cool and shabby sort
of way, and owner Kevin Niceley keeps it booked with quality local, regional,
indie and even major-label acts. In short, the Mercury is everything a rock
club should be. Wish we had more like it.
<H2>Best Jazz Club
</H2><P><STRONG>Lucille's</STRONG>
<P>We're in shock about this one. Not because Lucille's won; that was no
contest. With an astonishing variety of live jazz going past midnight six
nights a week, Lucille's (formerly Annie's), with more than a dozen years
of live jazz in the old city under its belt, polled more votes than all other
clubs put together. Known by reputation far outside the Tennessee Valley,
those who know jazz say it's a shoo-in as best jazz club in the state. Where
else in the world can you expect to see world-class musicians like pianist
Donald Brown--for two bucks? Lucille's status as Best was obvious. We're
shocked because, just as we tallied these results, the tax folks padlocked
Lucille's doors (through an apparent misunderstanding). After being unable
to find a seat at recent crowded evenings there, we can only figure they've
been undercharging for beer and wine. They're still trying. Stay tuned.
<H2>Best Country and Western Club
</H2><P><STRONG>Cotton-Eyed Joe</STRONG>
<P>Heeeeeee-Hawww! Pull on those shit-kickers, put on that ten-gallon hat
and be sure to tuck that shirt into those tight-fitting jeans. This mammoth
West Knox warehouse sent its competition scurrying into a pit filled with
tribute bands and Tex-Mex food, and now reigns supreme as the King of country
dance.
<H2>Best Dance Club/Dance Club DJ
</H2><P><STRONG>Underground/Storm</STRONG>
<P>Scott Wilkerson of local techno band the Speed Freeks said it best: "Knoxville
is a one [dance] club town." Sure, there are others that are often hipper
and always more intimate: Lord Lindsey's, Trump's, Mercury Theater--but for
the biggest sound, the brightest lights and the bubbling-over crowds, the
Underground has no competition. And on Wednesday nights, you can find DJ
Storm, leader of the old school Knoxville DJ's, spinning label-less slabs
of subterranean vinyl and flashy club cuts together, while the club kids,
frat boys and suburban gangstas shake it, baby, shake it, till 3 a.m.
<H2>Best Piano Bar
</H2><P><STRONG>Ivory's</STRONG>
<P>Almost subterranean, tucked discreetly away beneath Andrew Morton's gift
shop in Bearden, Ivory's is a piano speakeasy, a favorite refuge of both
performers and pianists--for those who've learned to overlook the Sequoyah
Hills riffraff. Performers are consistently good; both low-key locals and
traveling stars make their way to Ivory's stage.
<H2>Best Dive
</H2><P><STRONG>Gryphon's</STRONG>
<P>Hey, that's spin-cycle dive to you, bub. Fort Sanders's own combination
bar, coin laundry and low-rent music venue, Gryphon's may not be for the
faint of heart, but it certainly possesses more beer-stained charm than any
other neighborhood bar we can think of. Musically, you can find just about
anything and everything here, from post-punk to blues to acoustic folk. Lots
of local bands get their start on Gryphon's nonexistent stage, and we can't
think of the last time there was any sort of cover charge. And, band or not,
you're always guaranteed some sort of entertainment.
<H2>Best Concert Venue
</H2><P><STRONG>Bijou Theatre</STRONG>
<P>There's just not a bad seat in the house--not even up in the second balcony,
where there are no seats. It's a fitting showcase for fine performers (luminaries
from the Marx Brothers to Mel Torme to Los Lobos have basked in the glow
of those footlights) and it somehow seems to enhance lesser talents. Here's
to the ongoing restoration drive and the hope for a men's room where the
"fixtures" aren't in view of the whole lobby when someone opens the door.
<H2>Best Place for Men to Meet Women<BR>Best Place for Women to Meet Men
</H2><P><STRONG>Michael's</STRONG>
<P>Is it the availability of immediate seating? Is it the gold chains and
expensive sportswear? Perhaps the small, often packed dance floor? Regardless
of the specifics, Michael's is the only place in town that recreates the
unbridled, fin-de-si&egrave;cle glory of Reagan's last term--the perfect
atmosphere for meeting that special someone, at least until the vodka wears
off.
<H2>Best Place for Men to Meet Men<BR>Best Place for Women to Meet Women
</H2><P><STRONG>Carousel </STRONG>
<P>From the flashing lights and disco balls to the pit-style dance floor
to the lavish drag productions upstairs, the Carousel is a colorful carnival
of androgyny, the place to watch and be watched. And even if you're not on
the make, the Carousel is a delightful detour, a diversion from mainstream
mundanity.

<H2>Best Radio Station
</H2><P><STRONG>WNFZ-FM 94.3</STRONG>
<P>Their ratings may lag behind the big dinosaurs--er, dogs--but scrappy
newcomer WNFZ-FM knocked the other stations off the dial with their commercial
alternative (read: MTV Buzz Bin minus video) soundwaves. Sure, their rotation
playlist can be a bit repetitive (how many times a day do we really need
to hear Alanis remind us of life's little ironies?), but 94-Z also manages
to sound simultaneously slicker and fresher than a lot of the competition.

"Phil and Billy in the Morning"</STRONG>
<P>Even if you're fed up with "Free Bird," it's almost worth wading through
the retread to sample Philbio's backwoods wit, fraught with clever current
events references and cartoonish character voices conjured at the spur of
the moment. And although we miss the sober balance of Colvin Idol, who was
abruptly dismissed last year, Billy the Kid provides his Philness with an
able partner in chortle.<BR CLEAR=ALL>

Bill Williams, Bob Kesling, Marti Skold</STRONG>
<P>Anchor veteran Bill Williams has a certain grandfatherly charm--warm,
but low on mindless prattle. And Big Bob is always well-spoken and well-informed
behind the sports desk, engaging in his self-assured equanimity. And Marti
always exhibits preternatural calm before the storm--no matter how big it
is. They're just some of the reasons why WBIR remains, year in and year out,
head and shoulders above its competitors.

<P>The affable, nearly unflappable Hill generally exudes courtesy and happy
patter has he presides over a three-hours-a-day, five-days-a-week talkfest.
Hill describes himself as a political moderate, but is becoming hard to
distinguish from any other East Tennessee Republican these days, and struggled
unsuccessfully to dampen his pro-Lamar Alexander sentiments.

<P>For another year, Channel 10's Live at Five crew takes the local TV show
honor, reveling in the droll repartee of co-hosts Ted Hall and Moira Kaye
as they investigate Knoxville's fun and frisky quirks. But what's this? Hot
on its heels is none other than TNi's Prime Talk, rising up the ranks with
a growing popularity, no doubt due to the talk show's suncity-yet-charming
host, Bob Deck.

</H2><H2>Best Thing Knoxville Needs
</H2><P><STRONG>Gambling</STRONG>
<P>Beating out better roads, pro sports and, yes, riverfront development
came the leering face of legalized gambling. Can it be true? Do Knoxvillians
really want to throw the dice on lady luck? Or could it be that we already
feel like we're living in Vegas? (See "Best Slogan for
Knoxville.")<BR><EM>The Constructive Ideas: </EM>An aquarium, more parks,
downtown development, convention center, metro government.
<BR><EM>The Not So Constructive Ideas:</EM> To get rid of the Vols, to loosen
up, some class, less hippies, fewer rednecks, fresh blood, a major cool disaster,
an enema.
<BR><EM><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="bok_blimpr.gif" WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="55">The
Wistful Suggestions:</EM> Self-esteem, open minds, informed citizens,
a clean river, more people who make a difference, drivers who use turn signals,
appreciation from the locals--Knoxville's a great place to live.
<BR><EM>The Media Savvy Demands: </EM>A newspaper, a second newspaper, a
decent newspaper, Daily Metro Pulse. 
<BR><EM>The Most Concerted Effort to Stuff the Ballot Which Still Didn't
Win:</EM> A blimp.
<H2>Best Public Squabble
</H2><P><STRONG>The Waterfront</STRONG>
<P>Who knew such a teeny stretch of poisoned riverfront property could cause
such a fuss? But there it is: on one hand, waterfront development is a bit
of vitally needed downtown revitalization; on the other hand, will it really
work? Are interactive kiosks and virtual reality dioramas really gonna pull
in enough tourists to use up Mike Chase's parking lot? Can an $8 million
strip of concrete spur further private development? Let me tell you a story
about the World's Fair Site...
<BR><EM>Other Noteworthy Squabbles: </EM>City/county unification, Joe Taylor,
the Knox County Sheriff's firing range, the evolution bill, the farmer's
market.

vs. Carlene Malone, Ashe vs. Steven Smith, Ashe vs. Ron McMahon, Ashe vs.

</H2><P><STRONG>"Knoxvegas"</STRONG>
<P>Hmmm. Somehow that sounds familiar ... hey, I know! IT'S THE HEADING FOR
THIS SECTION. Oh well. Thankfully, others put their noggins to use and came
up with more imaginative suggestions.
<BR><EM>The Sincere:</EM> "The Best Place in America to Live," "The Best
New Old City in the South," "You'll Come to Love Us," "A Little Bit of Heaven,"
"A Great Place to Raise a Family."
<BR><EM>The Knoxcentric: </EM>"At Least It Ain't
Kentucky...Memphis...Nashville...Atlanta... Seattle...St. Louis."
<BR><EM>The Then-Why-Don't-You-Move-the-Hell-Away? Suggestions:</EM> "The
Town That Thinks It's a City," "The Land That Thought Forgot," "Not the End
of the Universe, But You Can See It From Here," "Pretentious Armpit," "More
Than a College Town, and Less!" "I Always Thought I Could Live Anywhere Until
I Moved to Knoxville," "Evolution Never Happened Here," "150,000 People,

<BR><EM>The Catchiest: </EM>"It's Knoxriffic!"
<BR><EM>Blimps, Blimps, Blimps:</EM> "Hey, We Need a Blimp."
<H2>Best Thing the City Ought to Spend Money On
</H2><P><STRONG>Schools/Education</STRONG>
<P>Despite the ongoing concern over how much the school budget creeps up
every year, it nevertheless appears to be the one thing most people would
like to spend more money on. Could it possibly be that we ought to spend
more on the education of our children, helping to ensure their futures as
productive adults? And, while we're at it, how about implementing some art
and music classes for primary grade schools? Naah, that'd be crazy, liberal
foolishness.
<BR><EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Better roads, downtown revitalization, waterfront
development.
<BR><EM>Most Direct:</EM> Prosecuting the turds who hold the city back from
progress.
<BR><EM>Suggestions for the Golf Ball Thing:</EM> Opening the Sunsphere,
outfits for the Sunsphere, turning the Sunsphere into a giant sunflower.
<BR><EM>The @&amp;#*! Blimp Entry:</EM> A blimp.
<H2>Best Explanation of the Knoxville-Based Alien Surgery Done 
on The X-Files
</H2><P><STRONG>Cas Walker</STRONG>
<P>Hey, the truth is out there. Or maybe it's here, too.
<BR><EM>The Imaginative Suggestions: </EM>The alien had consented to metro
government, the alien wanted to benefit from TennCare, an intuitive grasp
of what's really happening at the body farm, they were seeking the human
gene that causes running red lights, somebody thought they were in Asheville,
one city council meeting would help you understand, it's somehow connected
to waterfront development, TVA.
<BR><EM>The Unimaginative Suggestions: </EM>Weird, what the hell does this
mean, don't watch this, no idea, dumbest attempt at a category by Metro Pulse.
Uhhhh...Right: Make it legal to drink in the roadway and park, love--it's
only love, sanctimony, mimicking Warren Christopher's profile.
<BR><EM>Most Plausible:</EM> The director is related to the brother of a
woman who drove past Knoxville in 1982.
<BR><EM>The Patently Vicious:</EM> Randall Pedigo did it, they were trying
to give David Keith a talent transfusion and it failed, they could only get
an appointment with Stephen Cobble.
<BR><EM>Bliiiiiiimps: </EM>They arrived in a blimp.
<H2>Best Way to Get a Market Square Preacher to Stop Screaming at People
</H2><P><STRONG>Various forms of violence</STRONG>
<P>Although "Ignore him" certainly got a lot of votes (and we personally
advocate it), most people recommended some form of physical harm. From the
very simple "kill him" to the kicking of particular body parts, Knoxvillians
seem hell-bent on stifling loud religious expression on their lunch hour.
Suggested weapons include 357 Magnums, .38's, .45's, 9 mm's, stakes, fists,
cars, hand grenades, electricity, mace and a calzone.
<BR><EM>The More Humorous Suggestions:</EM> Institute a dress code, agree
with him, give him a hug, quote the Koran, repent en masse, reveal his tax
returns, talk to him rationally until you confuse him, tell him Jesus was
a liberal Jew.
<BR><EM>The Somewhat Sacrilegious: </EM>Dress up like Jesus, place your hand
on his shoulder, and say "I'll take it from here."
<BR><EM>Blimpblimpblimpblimp:</EM> Land a blimp on him.
<H2>Best Way to Repopulate Gay Street
</H2><P><STRONG>Free Parking</STRONG>
<P>Well, yeah, that would bring in more people--though the key is probably
having something there for them to park for. Suggestions included stores,
restaurants, bars, apartments and brothels. Many also said Gay Street ought
to be cleaned up and renovated, luring in new businesses and redevelopers
with tax incentives. 
<BR><EM>You Know It's Coming:</EM> Buy a blimp.
<H2>Best Category We Didn't List
</H2><P><STRONG>Best Fast Food</STRONG>
<P>Uh, yeah, we guess.
Other Good Suggestions That Would Make the Poll as Big as an Encyclopedia,
Thus Driving Us Further Into the Pits of Insanity: Neighborhood, newspaper
(hmph), local eccentric, 'zine, bank, bar, cappuccino, child care facility,
teacher, patio, graffiti, punk band, couple, doctor, home improvement store,
local commercial, jewelry shop, cemetery, dating service, hospital, lounge
singer, office supplies, web site, manicurist, public swimming pool, make-out
spot, social service/ nonprofit program. 
<BR><EM>"Worst" Suggestions:</EM> Worst corporation, worst local newspaper,
worst things Knoxville spent money on, worst poll in K-town.

<BR><EM>Oh,
Heck--Why Not: </EM>Drag king, hooters, kick in the jimmy, way
to reduce crime ("Don't let UT football players out without their chaperones."),
best looking red-headed chick, local hack writer, restaurant that closed.
<BR><EM>AAAAAAGH:
</EM>Blimp, blimp name, what size blimp does Knoxville
need?

...the average person with something to say had to resort to a photocopier and the U.S. Postal Service to publish thoughts, visions, questionable conspiracy theories, and photos of award-winning tomato plants.
<P>Those days are over. With nothing more than a basic grasp of HTML and space on a web server, countless people have made their lives as they see them available for global consumption. What drives otherwise calm, rational people to reveal their life details to anyone with an Internet connection? We'll leave that one up to an aspiring sociology Master's candidate and simply present a list of those who have their own web pages. This way, perhaps you can get to know your fellow Knoxvillians on a more personal basis, thus adding further tranquility to our community.
<P>If you: 1) live in Knoxville, 2) have a personal (<STRONG>not</STRONG> commercial!) web page, and 3) would like it listed here, send a note to our webmonkey (<A HREF="mailto:jojo@metropulse.com">jojo@metropulse.com</A>).

The Association of Alternative Newsweeklies (AAN) is the trade organization for alternative newspapers in North America. AAN is a diverse group of over a hundred non-daily publications, most of which are free-circulation papers. There is at least one AAN member in every major metropolitan area, and there are many others that publish in smaller markets. Each paper has a distinct identity that sets it apart from the mainstream press in its market.

<H2>1964</H2>
Unlike Oasis, this starry-eyed imitation of (and tribute to) the Fab Four cops not just the sound, but the boots and the suits and the haircuts, too. See Paul bob his head like he has a coiled spring for a throat, watch as Ringo shakes his shaggy hair out of his eyes, squint to see if this John can come up with anything even close to Lennon's wicked grin. And then there are the fans, attempting to re-create the hysteria with their squeals and gasps (no, really). Of course, the fact that the band's name is 1964 pretty much limits their repertoire, but anyone who enjoyed Backbeat should at least get a kick out of this dedicated and well-planned homage.
<STRONG><BR>1964
<BR>Tennessee Theatre, Sat., Jan. 11, 8 p.m., $15, 656-4444</STRONG>

<H2>J.D. CROWE AND THE NEW SOUTH</H2>
True blue (grass, that is) fans know well the three-decade history of revered banjo-picker J.D. Crowe, from his early days with Jimmy Martin in the '50s right on up to fronting the New South--an outfit that has proved a star-studded stepping stone for the likes of Tony Rice, Ricky Skaggs, Jerry Douglas, and Keith Whitley. They know his incredible discography (J.D. Crowe &amp; the New South, Live In Japan, and 1994's ebullient retrospective Flashback, to name a few). They mourned his temporary retirement that stretched from the late '80s to 1994, and they said hallelujah when he finally returned to his five-string--along with East Tennessean Phil Leadbetter on dobro and the fantastic Richard Bennett on vocals. And now they've got even more reason to crack a great big smile, as J.D. Crowe and the New South return to the Bijou Theatre with their sound that is at once contemporary and traditional--and, simply said, bluegrass at its best.
<STRONG><BR>J.D. Crowe &amp; the New South w/IIIrd Tyme Out
<BR>Bijou Theatre, Sat., Jan. 11, 7:30 p.m., $15, 656-4444</STRONG>

<H2>KING WEEK</H2>
In the spirit of the man which it honors, King Week is more than just a celebratory remembrance, but also--and perhaps most importantly--an opportunity for educational growth. The Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Commemoration kicks off with the annual Leadership Symposium, Thursday, Jan. 16, 9 a.m. at the Radisson Hotel. Guest speaker is Deborah Mathis, nationally syndicated columnist and White House correspondent for Gannet News Service. This will be followed by a Labor, Government, Business, and Industry Awards Luncheon; tickets are $30. The next generation steps up with a youth symposium on Saturday at Austin-East High School, 9 a.m. Finally, a celebration service takes place Sun., beginning with a parade at 4:30 p.m. at Tabernacle Baptist Church (2137 M.L.K. Ave.). The parade route winds up at Greater Warner Tabernacle AME Zion Church, where Rev. Dr. Benjamin Hooks, former Executive Director of the NAACP, will speak at 6 p.m.

</H1><P><STRONG>With the release of a new CD, Nancy Brennan Strange takes an overdue next step</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Chris Barrett</EM>
<P>More often than not, performers own two (or more) personalities. Knoxville
chanteuse Nancy Brennan Strange is no exception. But while the majority of your human stage traffic is subdued off the stage, and have to psych themselves
up in order to bubble for the footlights and microphone, Strange has to restrain
her real self to take the stage. Over the telephone, even her car phone, she chortles and chuckles incessantly, as if someone were tickling her stockinged
feet. In person, she's simply effervescent. 
<P>It's a positive trait, especially for a singer. 
<P>Strange's new CD, Les Etoiles Mysterieuse(Strange Stars), was released last week and celebrated by a gala round of Alive After Five at KMA. A charming
recording, lively enough to represent the buoyant Strange, Etoiles is
recommendable for a few reasons. 
<P>It's a Knoxville souvenir, for one thing--a veritable jazz who's who for
Knoxville in 1995. Donald Brown turns in some dazzling arrangements and does his usual sublime and understated job of polishing the ivory. Alongside Brown and Strange are Rocky Wynder, Harold Nagge, Hector Qirko, Pat Langham, Chris
Gray, Don Cassell, Jr. and others too numerous to mention, all of whom are in peak form. 
<P>First and foremost, however, Etoiles is a vocal record, and a damn good one at that. Chances are good that it would find its way into plenty of Christmas
stockings hereabouts even if the voice didn't belong to an Old City fixture and small town favorite daughter. If you've never heard Strange at one of her regular Wednesday night gigs at Lucille's in the Old City, or if you've only encountered her in her more prominent folk incarnation, plucking out "The Devil and the Farmer's Wife" or "Old Joe Clark," the silken warble that
reaches out from this homegrown record is apt to thump the umbrella out of your Mai-Tai.
<P>"Jazz has become an extension of the folk music for me," says Strange. "I always heard jazz growing up, like Ella Fitzgerald and Rosemary Clooney. It's just kind of evolved to this."
<P>Strange was bitten by the folk bug more than two decades ago, during the
fledgling Laurel Theatre's early days. An affinity for the music led her to Eastern Kentucky's June Appal records, which led her all over Appalachia
recording down-home folks in their kitchens and on their porches. She returned to Knoxville as a performer and has been playing, solo and in a number of bands, ever since. 
<P>After all that drinking straight from the well, so to speak, Strange now
spends her days passing the water along. Working with Project Able, she visits
four-year-olds in Sevierville Head Start schools, incorporating traditional music and storytelling into their curriculum. 
<P>The sidestep from Whitesburg to Birdland wasn't the result of a Road to
Damascus epiphany, though. Strange says it's a natural progression for anyone who enjoys singing as much as she does.
<P>"I'm more a folk kind of singer," says Strange. "The melodies are what
attracted me to jazz. And the lyrics have integrity. All those old torch songs--I really like those ..." She dissolves into laughter, and then gathers
herself to explain one reason why. "A couple weeks ago we were at Lucille's, and it seemed like I was singing all torch songs, like 'Lover Man, Oh Where Can You Be?' I looked out and noticed that almost everybody in the room was
alone, all these lonely hearts. But they looked happy. It seemed like a good
thing--that we could all be lonely together."
<P>Strange may be a "folk kind of singer," but the fact only does favors for her jazz ventures. Of the two singers she remembers from childhood, she leans more toward Clooney than Fitzgerald. Her approach is strictly musical and restrained, the only stylistic infusion coming from her sultry, burnished
voice. 
<P>On Etoiles  she gives Burt Bacharach's lyrics for "Walk On By" one of their most memorable readings. Where Dionne Warwick sang with bitten-lip, feigned and cheerful defiance, Strange pleads for kindness after the fact. The words "If you see me walking down the street/ I start to cry, each time we meet/ Walk on by ..." sound as if they've been sung across multiple time zones from a pay phone to an answering machine. Her feathered-edged wavering
pitch lends the tune an audible earnestness, and the band backs away (as most folks will when the subject is heartbreak) to allow the vocals to resound
all but a capella. 
<P>"I just want to be a really good singer," explains Strange, grinning ear to ear, which is as close to straight-faced as she gets, "and the only way to do that is to sing all the time. With just one jazz club in town, that's hard to do."
<P>A compact disc, Strange hopes, will allow her to find bookings in other
towns--she mentions New York in particular.
<P>"I have no idea what's going to happen," she says. "I just hope everybody
likes it."
<P>The odds, and stars, are in her favor.

<STRONG>Singer-songwriters Draper-Reynolds-Rodgers keep it "real"</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Ted Olson</EM>
<P>The three members of one of Knoxville's busiest bands are getting ready for another gig--setting up amps, adjusting mikes, tuning guitars. Meanwhile, in front of the makeshift stage--basically little more than a square of carpet in the back of the building--a contingent of the faithful have gathered. But no one's talking, smoking, or drinking; in fact, there's none of the usual pre-concert hubbub. 
<P>Instead, everyone's quietly sitting in folding chairs, patiently waiting for the music to begin. And when it does begin, the audience shows little outward emotion: sure, some are tapping their feet, but nobody's dancing. The trio on stage isn't at fault, though--the sound is perfect, the songs are tight, and their fans are obviously listening very carefully. Then again, it is Tuesday afternoon, and the venue isn't a bar, but a bookstore. These listeners simply want to sit and absorb the stories being sung, to savor the three-part harmonies, and, as soon as the words are learned, to sing along.
<P>A bookstore? But of course, and there's no telling where this group will turn up next. Vanessa Draper, Karen Reynolds, and Kit Rodgers--known collectively as Draper-Reynolds-Rodgers--have performed at a variety of venues around town, ranging from bookstores and bakeries to festivals and fundraisers. (Performing in unusual places is nothing new to Reynolds; as a young country-and-western singing phenom, she appeared at biker bars, private dances, strip dives, church socials, and in front of 30,000 people at a football stadium--but that's another story.)
<P>If pressed to categorize the trio, the most likely place to find them in a record store would be the section marked "singer-songwriters," a moniker often employed to describe a motley crew of musicians the wide-and-varied likes of Woody Guthrie and Joni Mitchell, as well as John Prine, John Hiatt, Tracy Chapman, and Victoria Williams, to name only a handful. Like those of great singer-songwriters before them, the self-penned songs of Draper-Reynolds-Rodgers are personal, emotional, thoughtful, and often blatantly non-commercial. This is a genre that often performs "unplugged," of course, but not always: the most influential singer-songwriter of them all, Bob Dylan, made some of his best music after plugging in at the Newport Folk Festival in the mid-1960s.
<P>Across the country today, the coffeehouse scene of singer-songwriters is booming. Yet, according to Draper, Reynolds, and Rodgers (who have toured, individually and as a group, throughout the southeastern United States), this type of music has not found the large audience in Knoxville that gather 'round it in nearby cities like Asheville and Nashville.
<P>Draper laments that, "If you don't play country or rock 'n' roll, it's hard to get gigs in Knoxville. Many people around here aren't all that interested in singer-song-writer music."
<P>Well, the uninitiated don't know what they're missing: these three are making some of the most enjoyable and interesting music around Knoxville, regardless of the genre. Reynolds states her hopes that "Once people get out and hear us, they'll enjoy our music. They'll sign up for our mailing list, and they'll start coming to hear us play, because they'll realize that we're real people who write and sing about real things."
<P>In concert, they have a collective repertoire of over 150 original compositions from which to cut-and-paste a set list (as well as select songs by favorite influences, e.g. Kate Wolf and Nanci Griffith). Draper, whose earliest musical inspirations were singer-songwriters like Jim Croce, Carole King, and Jackson Browne, writes songs that touch on political issues, "relationships gone south," and the joys of her favorite hobby--hiking in the Smokies. Reflecting her background in country music, Reynolds pens a mix of honky-tonk numbers and heartfelt ballads. And, in his songs, Rodgers--who formerly fronted the Atlanta-based alterna-rock band Clouds of Magellan--explores personal beliefs and social issues.
<P>All three musicians share lead and harmony singing responsibilities, and together they reach a seemingly effortless and seamless vocal blend. Reynolds' high harmony singing, a skill first developed during childhood jam sessions with her musician siblings, is the perfect partner for Draper's rich, lower-pitched lead voice. Both women laud Rodgers for his "exceptional, intense" vocal delivery. Instrumentally, the group's sound is as tight as a drum, and the three have worked out polished, rhythmically subtle, two- and three-part acoustic guitar accompaniments to carry the songs.
<P>Reynolds' explanation for the group's tight sound is that all three communicate with each with a comfortable ease. "To get the opportunity to play music with people you just really click with is a neat experience. That's the way it has been for me and Vanessa and Kit, and it's very unusual. Many people play with the same people for years, and they're always at each other's throats. But we just click. When we're on stage, we don't have to have eye contact to know where the other people are going with something; we can all feel it."
<P>Of the three, only Reynolds is a full-time musician--Draper works by day as a research administrator at a local orthopedic clinic, while Rodgers serves caf food at a West Knoxville eatery. Reynolds wears many musical hats: besides managing both her own band and some other groups, she also regularly sang the national anthem at Knoxville Smokies' home games this past summer and hosts an acoustic-only concert series at Sassy Ann's. She says her busy schedule is simply a natural outgrowth of her love for this type of music.
<P>"There are many good singer-songwriters around here whose stuff is worthy to be heard, and I for one want to call as much attention to them as possible."

<STRONG>A little bit boozy and a whole lotta bluesy, Crawdaddy may just be the busiest band in town</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Mike Gibson</EM>
<P>You couldn't call Crawdaddy a blues band, at least not from a purist's perspective. For one thing, their torrid sets are laced with too many neo-hippie nods and classic rock, soul, and reggae allusions to satisfy true Delta (or even Chicago) fundamentalists.<P>
Aside from that, their chops are just too damn good. Check out singer-harmonica player Mike Crawley's leather-lunged harp squall, or watch guitarist "Detroit" Dave splatter manic triplets at the climax of a particularly rapturous solo, his ham-hock forearms pumping like a piston on Quaaludes. Nope, these guy have practiced a little too much to merit real blues credentials.<P>
But even if Crawdaddy doesn't always march a perfect 12-bar cadence, there's an almost mystic essence, something intrinsic to the nature of Blues, lingering like so much resonant bottle-neck blare in the smoke-filled air at every Crawdaddy show.<P>
When drummer Steve brown and bassist Rick Wolfe are locked in and kicking out that barnstorming four-on-the-floor groove; when Crawley lewdly drapes his microphone cord across the silken shoulders of a comely female patron, singing and grinding cheek-to-cheek and loin-to-loin; when half the room is on its feet, eyes closed and butts shaking in to that ineffable Crawdaddy mojo... Well, suffice it to say that you almost forget that you're in a Knoxville fern bar and not in a Mississippi juke joint, that you're surrounded by goateed frat boys and not sharecroppers.<P>
"We know we're playing okay if there's at least five girls dancing up front," says Brown. "I think one of the reasons we have that effect is because we're not strictly a blues band, because we bring in a little ska, a little R &amp; B, or even a little jazz."<P>
Detroit Dave agrees. "We feel like we have the freedom to let the songs evolve and go where they will," he says. "We can let loose, and the song will hunt for the right groove.'<P>
Stirred up from the still-smoldering ashes of Bluefish, Crawdaddy started playing Knoxville clubs about three years ago when Brown and Dave tapped Crawley's frayed nasal rasp and blitzkrieg harp howl for a project that at the outset was supposed to be "strictly R&amp;B." Wolfe, Brown's rhythm partner in several other local bands, soon joined on bass.<P>
"Part of what made us what we are is that we've got two virtuoso musicians, Mike and Dave," says Brown. <P>
"We all bring a little different seasoning to the pot," Crawley offers. "These guys have an endless amount of music knowledge. Steve knows a million rhythms and Dave knows a million chords."<P>
Although the band's collective virtuosity and often eclectic taste eventually broadened their set list's stylistic range, their sound has remain singularly Crawdaddy--a little boozy, very bluesy, and possessed of an insatiable rhythmic flair.<P>
Today, you're likely to hear them dust off a Tyrone Davis R&amp;B classic, showcase an obscure rock nugget from Tom Waits or slide guitarist David Lindley, and cover the latest Blues Traveler tune, all within the space of a single set.<P>
They also toss in a gaggle of originals, just in case they ever get the urge to reproduce their swampy hoodoo stomp in studio captivity. "We're working on a lot of new stuff," Wolfe says. "We've got years of cocktail napkins full of lyrics we're still trying to piece together."<P>
"Our originals are bluesy," says Crawley. "We just do whatever comes, whatever feels right. But whatever we start with, we can eventually punch it up and put the right feel to it."<P>
In the meantime, these battle-scarred thirtysomethings aren't mooning around with any pie-in-the-sky visions of stardom. They seem content keeping daytime jobs (Wolfe and Brown work in music stores, Crawley is a waiter and harmonica teacher) and playing nighttime gigs.<P>
Which isn't to say that Crawdaddy doesn't stay busy. With three or four local shows scheduled in an average week, they might just be Knoxville's most in-demand band. And if that wasn't enough, they just added an acoustic sidelight, dubbed "Crawbaby," for gigs that call for something a little less plugged in.<P>
"We call it 'songs we don't know,'" Wolfe chuckles. "Someone will yell out a song and we'll try it. If it works, we'll keep it."<P>
"It's basically just an acoustic version of what we do as Crawdaddy," Crawley says. "We're just trying to have fun, doing whatever it takes. We're all kind of making out way and following a strange dream."

</H1><P><STRONG>State Champs win big with their not-to-scale brand of arena
rock
</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Randall Brown</EM>
<P>
It's usually a little awkward the first time you meet a local band in order
to write about them. As a writer, you hope they'll be at least as interesting
as their music (or in some cases, more). As a band, they don't trust for
one minute that you know anything about music, especially theirs.
<P>
But I was able to bond with the State Champs recently when our conversation
almost immediately digressed into celebrity name-dropping. While pondering
one fan's suggestion that their sound was like 'Butthole Surfers meets Vanilla
Fudge,' I mention to them that I once saw ex-Fudge drummer Carmine Appice
at IHOP. They are duly challenged.
<P>
"The only famous person I ever met was Bert Convy," says bassist/vocalist
Sweet Bobby, a.k.a. Rob Matthews. "I was at Epcot Center and they were
filming 'Win, Lose or Draw.'"
<P>
"I met the whole 'Facts of Life' team," says guitarist/vocalist
Johnny Turbo (nee Seth Severance), playing something of a trump card. "But
when I was younger, my family saw 'Hollywood Squares' being taped. I met
Eric Estrada and John Candy. And ALF. But, ALF, you know... "
<P>
"I met Jerry Springer just recently," offers drummer g (known
to his mother as Chris) leather (his real name, I swear).
<P>
"I met Alex Haley up at the Museum of Appalachia," says guitarist
Freebird McQueen, a.k.a. Kelly Sprouse.
<P>
"I saw him at IHOP, too," I mention.
<P>
"This is where we obviously go wrong," laughs Turbo. "We've
got to start hanging out at IHOP."
<P>
Celebrity hobnobbing notwithstanding, the State Champs are one of the more
down-to-earth ensembles on the local scene, and are remarkably unself-conscious
for early twenty-somethings. Their lack of inhibition comes out in the
tongue-in-cheek
array of image gimmicks they employ, from matching shirts to their religious
adherence to stage names.
<P>
"It's all about the overall entertainment value," explains Turbo,
hitting on the State Champs' basic manifesto.
<P>
I experienced the band's entertainment value some weeks ago at a small
sort-of-club
on Broadway. They wailed through the gig with what could be called actual
rock 'n' roll abandon, stumbling and bouncing around the stage in matching
"Favorite Mart" T-shirts, trying to out-cheese each other with
rock star poses. The crowd was sparse, but the band put on a real show,
giving their all to the far-less-than-full house, even awarding their obligatory
State Champs "Best Fan of the Night" prize, an autographed chair,
to yours truly in an admitted display of ass-kissing. It was refreshing,
a mixture of selfless humor and energy rarely seen since the demise of Smokin'
Dave and the Premo Dopes. And then an anonymous fan confided that "they
seemed kind of tired tonight."
<P>
They are taken aback when I mention that they were originally described
to me as a "low-fi" ensemble.
<P>
"Does that mean we suck?" asks Sweet Bobby.
<P>
"I think we're actually arena rockers in the bodies of a small club
band," counters Turbo.
<P>
The ambiguity of "low-fi" aside, they do have a raw rock sound--
guitars cranked to distortion, straightforward, no-frills drum pounding,
untrained vocals projected with gutsy confidence. But I won't insult them
with suggestions that they are "heavy alternative." They fall,
locally, somewhere between the garage passion of the Tuffskins and the controlled
madness of Stinkfoot USA.
<P>
Lyrically, the State Champs' songs run a thematic gamut. They have the usual
"lost love" songs, like "Jenny, a Woody and Me" and
"Too Proud to Beg," but they also tell some interesting tall tales.
A late night at a convenient store becomes a party in "Hot Fries and
Beer." College exams are revealed as the metaphor for lifelong angst
that they are in "Dear Mr. Overachiever." Most significantly,
the gentrification of the American South is discussed in "Railroad
Tracks: Cause for Cultural Segregation or Merely the Foundation of Mass
Transportation in America?"
<P>
"Somebody from the Beacon ," says g leather, "wrote that
'If John Candy were wrestling Roger Rabbit in the Louvre&nbsp;...'"
<P>
"... 'the State Champs would be the running commentary,'" adds
Turbo. "That's pretty descriptive."
<P>
"We were like, 'Is that a compliment?'" says McQueen. "What
are they trying to say?"
<P>
"We don't mind being related to John Candy," says Turbo. "But
we kind of want to get away from cartoon characters. Maybe John Candy and
Eric Estrada. That'd be a good fight."
<P>
Though confident enough in their music to display such a sense of humor
intact, the State Champs are not a joke band. Amidst playing with their
"image," fan giveaways and pop culture worship, they want to do
something as a band, to become "known."
<P>
"I really feel like we've got something to offer that a lot of people
don't," says Turbo, "and that there are going to be some people
out there who are going to find worth in it."
<P>
"We'll be a footnote in Knoxville music history," predicts Sweet
Bobby, "and I will make it into a Jack Neely article."
<P>
***State Champs' legal names are published against their most vehement
wishes.

<P><STRONG>Thrown more than its fair share of hard luck, Dynamo Humm has gotten really good at making lemonade.</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Randall Brown</EM>
<P>We hear a lot about the "Rock Factor" in local music, but what about the all-important, but so often neglected, "Roll Factor?" As in "roll with the punches." Dynamo Humm found themselves with unexpected company recently, when they were joined onstage by a rowdy fan who must have seen that new "Mentos"-style Foo Fighters video one too many times. The rambunctious fellow grabbed singer-guitarist Will Fletcher's back-up guitar and chimed in on the chorus of their song "Another Like You."
<P>The band dealt with it without missing a beat. They were already performing under the duress of partial microphone failure, and it took them a minute to notice they had company. To the drunk guy's credit, the near-unintelligible Nirvana lyrics he chose to add to the band's song were in perfect meter.
<P>"He was right in key," says Fletcher, "right in time to the song. But then I noticed he had my guitar."
<P>"Yeah, getting up onstage is one thing," says bassist Nathan Mitchell, "but the guitar is off-limits." Without dropping a note from the bass line, Mitchell physically escorted the unwanted doo-wopper off the stage.
<P>"I just sort of got in his face," says Mitchell.
<P>So score one for Dynamo Humm for valor in the face of adversity. Named for a Frank Zappa song (which they swear they've only heard once--they just liked the sound of the title), Fletcher, Mitchell and drummer Paul Turpin came together after the usual string of bands that come and go (Fletcher and Mitchell played together in the Genghis Khan Artists for a couple of years). They play an old-school, rough and tumble brand of three-piece rock that, like I might have mentioned earlier, also rolls. It's the "old Stones" spirit, and classic influences like the Faces, that come to mind. 
<P>Fletcher and Mitchell crank out the raw-but-rhythmic guitar/bass energy over Turpin's take on Ringo drumming--steady rolling beats without all that artsy fooling around. It's only rock 'n' roll, but you know what they say.
<P>Stage-crashers and equipment failure aside, they are more concerned currently with not having a permanent practice space. Since Fletcher moved from his previous apartment, they've been borrowing space from various other bands (particularly the very gracious State Champs). Still, they don't whine about it, but turn it to their advantage. Practicing at low volumes (sometimes unplugged in the most literal sense), with Turpin using brushes, they've discovered they pay more attention to the nuts and bolts side of songwriting.
<P>"You have to be able to play a song really quiet," says Mitchell, "and then play it really loud, also. I like volume, but if it only sounds good loud, then it isn't as good a song."
<P>Their practice habits seem to be working for them. Judging by the size of their set list, they are possibly the most prolific band in Knoxville.
<P>"Yeah, most bands say 'We've got 15 songs,'" says Mitchell, "but we wrote 15 last week."
<P>Dynamo Humm songs don't waste time tackling lofty issues, or discussing Derrida and such. They get right to the point of everyday life. 
<P>"Our songs are just about stuff that happens," explains Mitchell.
<P>"And girls," adds Fletcher. "Girls and stuff that happens. That's it."
<P>They also cover some not-already-overdone classic songs--the Rolling Stones' "Little T&amp;A" and "Star Star," Paul McCartney's "Let Me Roll It," and "Bummer" by the Grifters. They're proud of the off-the-beaten-path nature of their cover picks--great rock songs that have somehow escaped becoming "standards" of the cover band mill. 
<P>But it's their ever-growing original set list that takes center ring. Basic, good songs are the key to Dynamo Humm. It makes for a no-nonsense confidence in their presentation. When you ask them what they do, they don't have to mull it over.
<P>"We like to think that we rock," says Fletcher.
<P>"It's really good stuff," says Mitchell. "We just want to get it out to people, because we think they'll like it."
<P>"I think the best thing about our music is that it's honest," says Fletcher. "We write what we write. We don't try to write a song to any kind of form. If you go into a band with the idea of 'We're going to sound like this,' I think that's where a lot of stress occurs."
<P>"You end up sounding like something," says Mitchell, "but six months later it's out of style."

<P><STRONG>With a sly wink and a knowing smirk at early rock, The Holy Ghosts know the value of "it's got a good beat and you can dance to it."</STRONG>
<P><EM>by John Sewell</EM>
<P>Local music whizkid Brett Winston has been part of the Knoxville scene for some time now, following the usual route for an aspiring musician, a pretty typical roller-coaster of revolving door bands and wrong-place-at-the-wrong-time happenstance. His most notable bands have been El Smarto and the sadly underrated Stinkfoot U.S.A., who unexpectedly broke up on the verge of releasing their first CD. Personally, I've always thought Winston had plenty of talent but that his bands were a little too self-consciously eclectic for their own good. Sure, all his bands featured excellent musicians, but they somehow seemed too ambitious, sailing over the heads of the average listener (including myself).
<P>And when I heard Winston's new band, The Holy Ghosts, described as "a mixture of Tom Waits and Elvis," I had to cringe just a little. The last thing Knoxville needs is another "tormented poet" with delusions of picaresque bardhood. But after actually hearing the band play, I'm pleased to report that these guys aren't too heavily onto a beatnik trip. Instead of falling into a quagmire of artsy pretense, The Holy Ghosts have stumbled upon a mix of good time, Buddy Holly-esque music that hearkens back to the simple roots of rock and country. These guys are fun.
<P>It all came about after the demise of Stinkfoot U.S.A., when Winston decided to take charge of his own band, tackling lead vocals as well as his usual guitar duties.
<P>"After Jon [Stinkfoot vocalist Jon Wallace] moved I couldn't think of anyone that I would want to sing," he says. "Also, I had started to come up with complete musical ideas where I had all the parts: the lyrics, the vocals, and all the music. I always sort of wanted to sing anyway, but I just never thought I could."
<P>Winston assembled a virtual who's who of local musicians to fill the band: Matt Fuller (also of Superfly Sound Trip and various jazz combos) on bass, Doug Campbell (formerly of Dim Kitchen and The Family Jewels) on guitar and--at least for their first few shows--cello, and Jason White (former Stinkfoot U.S.A. percussionist) on drums.
<P>The guys in the band have no problem accepting Winston's role as leader. When asked who is the king of the band, everyone points at Winston.
<P>"I understand that's just a part of our agreement," Campbell says. "I have songs that I get to see realized through the band, but Brett comes up with all of the lyrics. It's not like Brett tells us exactly what to play. I don't consider his telling us what kind of mood to go for musically to be condescending. I consider it enlightenment."
<P>The band's music is a new direction for Winston, whose earlier groups were more oriented toward fusion. The Holy Ghosts' songs utilize the standard framework of American roots rock, coming up with an amalgam of rock, blues, and country that stresses an emphasis on danceability.
<P>Winston says he got the idea to simplify the music from listening to '50's music on the radio. He says he prefers the naive, spontaneous feel of early rock to the pre-packaged alienation of today's alternative rock.
<P>"I just really love the music from that era," he says. "There is always a fresh feeling to those old songs that you just don't find that much today."
<P>Although you can't comfortably hang a "goof rock" tag on these guys, it's obvious they don't waste any time on angst, either.
<P>"I mean, with some of the places we've played, you just have to have a sense of humor. We've even gone out and played among the hippies," Winston says. "But we don't have zany humor like Frank Zappa; it's more of a black humor."
<P>The band's humor was definitely on the darker side when they chose their aliases. Onstage, White, Fuller, Campbell, and Winston morph into Johnny Satan, Reverend Pyro, Crack Baby Shivers, and He Who Can Not Be Named, respectively. Black humor indeed.
<P>The Holy Ghost's have garnered quite a lengthy set list in their short time together. The back-to-basics style of the band lends itself to quick songwriting; in the three or four months they've been together, they've managed to come up with a repertoire of some 60 songs--all originals.
<P>Winston says that if a song doesn't come together quickly, the band usually just forgets about it.
<P>"The songs come along fast, and if we don't get an immediate feeling for it, we usually move along," he shrugs. "We have a lot of songs, but we try to vary the sounds. Our songs don't all sound the same, except sometimes."
<P>So far The Holy Ghosts have found receptive audiences wherever they have played. These days the band can be found playing upstairs at Hawkeye's almost every Saturday night to a crowd of dancing fools.
<P>"It's a hell of a lot of fun and it doesn't take a lot of work and that's cool," Winston reasons. "It brings something out in people, you know? I mean they were dancing!"

<P><STRONG>Noise is music to the ears of Beeswax, a laid-back trio out to prove there really is use for algebra after high school.</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Knees McReal</EM>

<P>It's another August Saturday night at Gryphon's, swarming with regular barflies and scenesters too cool to let something like 100 percent humidity stop them from wearing their indie rock corduroys. The live music wing of the legendary Fort Sanders' spin-cycle dive is more than just a hotbed of local rock 'n' roll; it's a freakin' sauna. Even the red-as-Eddie-Van-Halen's-guitar walls seem to be dripping with sweat. 
<P>The band members look like they're about to pass out from heat exhaustion, stopping between songs to wring out their T-shirts and try in vain to quell the veins of perspiration trickling down their foreheads. But the dehydration that such unventilated passion brings marks a landmark evening for the loose-limbed trio on "stage." For the bottles upon bottles upon cans upon pitchers necessary to keep the crowd alive means that, after six shows played around town, Beeswax will see some monetary returns. And, after divvying the cash three ways, then doling out a cut to each member, vocalist/guitarist Todd Stapleton, bassist Scott Heiskell and drummer Scott Henshaw will stumble away with a grand total of $5.55 each.
<P>"Of course, we really just play Gryphon's for the free beer," Henshaw reveals.
<P>A basement band in the most literal sense of the term, Beeswax came together after Henshaw and Stapleton hooked up through posted flyers name-checking common favorites like Pavement and Archers of Loaf. After a couple of months of drum and guitar cacophony and working their way through a tragi-comedy of failed attempts at finding a bassist, they were about to give in and forgo the rumbling underbelly. In a fit of inspired desperation, Stapleton called up a former bandmate from his metal--no, wait, "trash rock"--past in the band-whose-name-shall-not-be-spoken. Heiskell was originally just lending a hand, filling in until they could find another bassist.
<P>"I decided to stay because it was better than I expected," he says, only half-joking. "And I wanted a chance to redeem myself musically."
<P>Redemption comes in the form of what the three casually refer to as noise, a spontaneous audio combustion of rock 'n' roll whiplash that is, as Dinky Doo frontman Stewart Pack has said, heavy without hitting you over the head with it.
<P>But, if this is noise rock, how is it also so melodic... so listenable? The answer lies in Stapleton's definition of the genre, which is as atypical as his guitar tunings.
<P>"To me, noise is chaotic, like Pussy Galore. There's some harmony," he reckons, "'cause we are, after all, interested in making songs. It's more than feedback and fuzz."
<P>Or, as Henshaw sums it up, "Noise is playing a couple of songs so hard your guitar goes out of tune and you don't bother to fix it."
<P>I thought that was called drunk rock.
<P>"That too."
<P>And, if you're into the pretensions of Option magazine-speak, you could probably call what Beeswax does "math rock"--ironic considering Stapleton is in fact a math major. So are his tunings derived via the Pythagorean theorem?
<P>"Yeah, we plug a calculator right into the amp," Stapleton says with the kind of smart-ass tone you don't really expect from a math major. "We even looked for a math-related name for a while." Some bands try opening the dictionary at random; Beeswax tried "flipping through the calculus book."
<P>Make that "geek rock."
<P>As has often been pointed out in the old faithful Metro Pulse calendar, Beeswax does bear a certain resemblance to geeks the likes of Pavement and Sebadoh. Stapleton's "slack-ass, devil-may-care" vocal style and guitar swagger/stagger are bent on the band's slanted and enchanted melodies, while the one-two rhythm punch of Heiskell and Henshaw stings like a pissed-off bee. And, somewhere in the midst of all that indie rock inspiration, white-hot traces of the Rolling Stones (you know--the founding fathers of trash rock) and Royal Trux can be heard in Stapleton's woozy guitar licks, especially in songs like "Fodder" and "Malfunction Junction."
<P>The spiraling loops of loosely strung-together non-sequiturs that make up the songs' lyrics aren't anything that would come out of the mouth of Mick Jagger, though. Just try to imagine Mr. Sticky Fingers strutting around an arena stage, crowing about "receding coastal lines/ making everything sublime/ got caught shaving in the check-out line." Don't get it? Well, neither do Henshaw and Heiskell.
<P>"You took that literally?," Stapleton queries.
<P>"Yeah, man, I thought it meant shoplifting a Bic," Henshaw shrugs.
<P>"You've never heard anyone talk about shaving money?"
<P>"No, what the hell are you talking about?"
<P>"So you guys don't understand these songs."
<P>"Guess not."
<P>"What was your translation?" Stapleton asks Heiskell, no doubt hoping for some sort of validation.
<P>"Actually," he drawls, "I didn't give a shit."
<P>Long-winded titles the likes of "Anti-Acoustic Blues Groove In C" and "Thermal Bremmstrahlung" (yes, a math term) don't offer many clues or clarification.
<P>"I just try to come up with stuff nobody else uses," Stapleton explains. "We're not going to write a 'Lightning Strikes' or anything with the word "love" in it.
<P>So, no love, no angst...
<P>"We've got nothing to bitch about, no political platform to take," he continues. "I guess what I'm trying to say is we've got nothing important to say. We just wanna..."
<P>"...rock," says Henshaw, without a second of hesitation.
<P>And rock they do on their recently recorded demo, the curiously-yet-intriguingly titled The Wrath and Fury of the Backslide Trash Heap Jive. Co-produced by local music conspirator Gray Comer (recently of the Family Jewels), the tape kicks in immediately with a drone of air-raid siren-gone-wrong guitar lash before settling into an infectious churn of rumbling noise.
<P>And, even though they're not quitting their day jobs in spite of the Gryphon's windfall, the band has high hopes for their rock 'n' roll future.
<P>"Hey, if they'll let Eddie Murphy make a record," Stapleton figures, "our chances have gotta be good."

UT's on its Hill, all's right with the world. Everybody can kick back and
enjoy one long tailgate party into the next century, right?
<P>
Maybe, but don't bet your season tickets on it.
<P>
The University of Tennessee--both the Knoxville campus and the statewide
system--is on the cusp of changes the like of which it hasn't experienced
since the heady growth of the 1960s.
<P>
Before the new millennium dawns on Jan. 1, 2001, a generation of aging UT
administrators and faculty members--hundreds of names and faces familiar
in Knoxville and across the state--will have retired or at least be eligible
to do so.
<P>
Without an heir apparent to President Joe Johnson, UT's leadership is poised
to come out from under a four-decade domination by a succession of administrators
who got their start under the late governor Buford Ellington.
<P>
Meanwhile, the university system will bend more or less (depending on who's
telling it) to other forces, including legally mandated gender engineering
that will reconstitute the UT board of trustees and a proposal that would
merge the UT system with the four-year universities governed by the state
Board of Regents.
<P>
No one can yet say what this mix of forces will mean, but the potential for
broad change is undeniable.
<H3>On the Road to Valhalla
</H3><P>The graying of UT's administration and faculty is the biggest foreseeable
change on the school's horizon. The list of administrators who are nearing
retirement age is impressive both in number and in the prestige of their
positions:
<P>
&#183; President Joe Johnson will be 63 in July.
<P>
&#183; Bill Snyder, chancellor of the system's Knoxville campus, will be
65 in October.
<P>
&#183; Athletic Director Doug Dickey will be 64 in June.
<P>
&#183; Beauchamp Brogan, the system's general counsel, is already 66.
<P>
&#183; Charles Brakebill, vice president for development, is 71.
<P>
Another key group is closing in on 65: executive vice president Emerson Fly
(61), VP for agriculture D. M. Gossett (64), associate VP for government
relations Walter Lambert (60), and the chancellor at UT Chattanooga, Frederick
Obear (60).
<P>
Even the youngsters on the staff--Homer Fisher, senior VP; Sammie Lynn Puett,
VP for public service, continuing education and community relations; Margaret
Perry, the chancellor at UT Martin; and Bill Rice, who heads the UT Medical
School in Memphis--will be in their sixties by 2000.
<P>
Only the babies of the bunch--treasurer Charles Peccolo, Space Institute
VP Dwayne McCay and Johnson's executive assistant, Billy Stair--are in their
forties and have the possibility of building significant years of service
in the new century.
<P>
Likewise, retirement is sneaking up on an unusually large number of the faculty.
In fall 1994, UT number crunchers calculated that 32.7 percent of the
university's 1,275 faculty were between 50 and 59; another 14 percent were
between 60 and 65. Thus almost 47 percent of the current faculty will either
be retired or seriously contemplating the prospect by 2001.
<P>
"Most universities are in similar situations across the country," says John
Clark, executive director of UT's news center. Clark says that the postwar
baby boom forced UT and other schools into drastic expansion in the '60s.
The pending retirements are the result of that extraordinary hiring surge.
<P>
The unprecedented turnover means that a generation of leadership will more
or less evaporate from the halls and classrooms of UT.
<H3>The Case of the Missing Understudy
</H3><P>Of course, the retirement that matters most in the overall scheme
of things is that of the president of the UT system.
<P>
Joe Johnson, an Alabama native who got his start working in finance for Ellington
and Ed Boling, is hired by and serves at the pleasure of the UT board of
trustees, which is appointed by the governor. Subject to the approval of
the trustees, Johnson himself hires the chancellors and other officers.
<P>
Though he has no current plans to retire, the president says of himself,
"I'll be 63 on July 9, and I can tell you that Joe Johnson will not be here
when he's 70."
<P>
"I've got 40 and a half years in the retirement system," Johnson says. "One
day it will come.
<P>
"The board and I will make the decision mutually. I'm not going to give them
two weeks notice and leave. It will happen in a graceful, planned, sensible
sort of way, so that the board has time to find a successor."
<P>
What is exciting to UT watchers is the growing awareness that, for the first
time at least since the '50s, there is no heir apparent, no understudy who
has been carefully groomed to take over when Johnson steps down.
<P>
When the sainted Andy Holt became president in 1959, he presided over a decade
of unparalleled growth at the university. As he played front man and glad-handed
a whole state into sending its kids and its money to UT, Ed Boling was the
inside man, managing the school's finances and engineering the geographical
expansion of the campus via federal urban-renewal laws.
<P>
At Holt's retirement in 1970, Boling had but a short step into the
responsibilities of the top job. Johnson took on the understudy role and
most likely would have followed Boling into the presidency had fate--in the
person of an out-of-work governor--not intervened.
<P>
Having served his two-term maximum as Tennessee governor, Republican Lamar
Alexander seized upon the presidency of UT as a highly visible spot in which
to await his next political post. Administration insiders admit that Alexander
even managed to engineer Boling's early retirement. In the process, he
interrupted the line of succession, which would have pitted Johnson against
another UT insider, Charles Smith, now the chancellor of the state Board
of Regents.
<P>
When President George Bush needed a new secretary of education a scant two
years later, Alexander got the call. Smith had gone on to head the state
Department of Education, and Johnson finally acceded to the throne with no
real competition.
<P>
The lack of his own organizational heir doesn't trouble Johnson.
<P>
"I don't feel that it's my job to pick my successor," he says. "It's my job
to have people within the fabric of the institution who can step in and handle
the job." In that context, he mentions Rice, Perry, Gossett and John Peters,
the vice chancellor for academic affairs at UTK.
<P>
"If Joe Johnson dropped dead tomorrow," he says, "the university has people
that could step up to handle that job until the board picks people to run
the university.
<P>
"If I've just got a bunch of stumblebums around, I've failed."
<P>
Others in the university aren't so sanguine about the process by which UT's
leadership is chosen. Some faculty members fear that the internal politics
evident in the choice of Alexander and Johnson will discourage outsiders
from applying in the national search that will be mounted when the time comes.
<P>
Trustee and former board vice chairman Jim Haslam scoffs at that idea. "It's
a good job," Haslam says. "The university has such tremendous potential and
is in such good shape that it would be very attractive to people across the
country.
<P>
"There will have to be a national search. There will probably be in-house
candidates. There will be more from outside."
<P>
Many faculty members are skeptical. Burned by the role state politics played
in the hiring of Alexander and Johnson, many faculty want an honest search
that plays by academic rules and is free of political considerations. The
most cynical suggest that the UT system and its top layer of administration
should be eliminated and each campus should fend for itself.
<P>
The current president of the UT Faculty Senate questions the wisdom of not
having an understudy or two in waiting. Dhyana Ziegler, who also serves as
associate director of diversity resources and educational services, believes
Johnson should have a process that would allow interested professors to explore
a move into administration.
<P>
"I have no visible signs of anybody being in the pipeline to take President
Johnson's place," Ziegler says. "We need to be growing our own in-house;
Joe and Bill Snyder were grown in-house. It makes sense to have some insiders
in the pipeline."
<P>
One of the most prominent African Americans on the Knoxville campus, Ziegler
also faults the administration for a failure to bring diversity to the
president's staff. "The issue of diversity is a bone of contention with me,"
she says. "There is no advocate for diversity on the president's staff."
<P>
She praises Snyder for increasing the awareness of diversity issues on the
Knoxville campus but says, "Across the whole UT system, we need some person
of color in the president's office in a position of power."
<H3>And the winner is...
</H3><P>Johnson will not hazard a prediction as to who his replacement might
be, and UT insiders are also mum, apparently because there really isn't a
clear front-runner at this time.
<P>
It's easier to predict who it won't be. Most of Johnson's administrative
colleagues are too close to his own age to be effective candidates for the
post. Snyder, who enjoys a broad popularity on the Knoxville campus, is older
than Johnson and is focused on the work he's undertaken as UTK chancellor.
He said he has no immediate retirement plans because "I have several things
I want to accomplish in this job. They'll take several years to come to
fruition."
<P>
One of Snyder's chief efforts has been to set up a process for linking the
school's goals and priorities with planning and budgeting, so that the money
goes where UT's strengths are.
<P>
"Expecting no growth in the level of funding, we will have to pay more attention
to re-allocating the resources we have, emphasizing our top priorities and
putting our resources there," he says. He hopes to get that principle firmly
established before retiring.
<P>
The next president is also not likely to be Smith of the Board of Regents.
When asked, he answers with one unqualified word: no.
<P>
"I intend to stay where I am till I retire," Smith says. "I committed myself
not to use this position as a stepping stone to anything else, and I intend
to fulfill that commitment."
<P>
That news will come as a relief to many on the UTK campus, where Smith is
widely seen as a little too visibly ambitious for the comfort of his fellow
academics.
<P>
Possibly the most significant retirement besides the president's will be
that of athletic director Doug Dickey, who is almost a year older than Johnson.
When that time comes, the choice of a new AD will belong to the president.
<P>
"Athletics play a key role in the life of a university," Haslam says. "Any
university CEO will want a very capable person in that position."
<P>
"I would expect that Joe and Doug might leave almost simultaneously," he
says. "The next president ... the athletic director will be his or her call.
It will obviously be a key hire for the new individual."
<P>
Haslam speculates that the top spot in UT athletics may not go to a coach
next time.
<P>
"The old days of a football coach retiring and taking over the athletic
department are over," he explains. "These days, an AD must identify head
coaches, retain them and make sure the program is always in compliance with
the NCAA."
<P>
"The next AD will be a marketer and a fund-raiser, and will have tremendous
managerial skills."
<H3>Guys and Dolls
</H3><P>High-level retirements won't be the only pressure the UT system comes
under in the next five years. Some longtime UT watchers expect that legislatively
mandated changes in the makeup of the board of trustees will have a significant
effect on the system's future.
<P>
When former governor Ned McWherter refused to appoint women in appropriate
numbers to the UT board and other state bodies, angry lawmakers responded
with legislation which mandates that every other trustee appointed to the
board be a woman.
<P>
Gov. Don Sundquist is expected to abide by the statute, so of the six trustees
he will appoint before June, three will be women.
<P>
Some among the faculty and staff predict that as the board approaches equity
between men and women, the panel's approach to governance will change. Both
Johnson and Haslam disagree.
<P>
"I don't think more women on the board will change the nature of the university
or the administration," Haslam says. "Excellent women have served and have
made decisions not because of gender but based on what's best for the
university."
<P>
Johnson echoes the sentiment: "If governors continue to appoint strong,
thoughtful people to the board, male or female, I wouldn't anticipate the
approach to the university, its governance or the setting of goals would
change."
<P>
Smith of the Board of Regents agrees, but he has one caveat. He notes that
the male trustees have been predominantly bankers and lawyers; women coming
onto the board will likely come from other professions, possibly bringing
different approaches to their responsibilities.
<P>
"When the boards get to be 50-50, the women  may bring a broader perspective,"
he says.
<H3>Practicality a nonstarter
</H3><P>The suggestion that looms smallest in the university's future is
a proposal in the governor's Commission on Practical Government to merge
the UT system with the four-year schools now governed by the state Board
of Regents.
<P>
The report, released last month, recommends that all four-year state institutions
be put under the same governing board and chief executive and that a separate
board and CEO be created for the community colleges, technical schools and
technology centers. A bipartisan panel under the chairmanship of Ronald Terry,
former head of First Tennessee National Corp., compiled the study at Gov.
Sundquist's request.
<P>
"The existing governance system of Tennessee higher education is so fragmented
that it does not provide the focus or accountability necessary to respond
to the state's vision, to be the primary engine of the state's economic growth,
to control program proliferation and redundancy or to be cost effective,"
the report states.
<P>
"The $133 million in systems and campus overhead is excessive, and reducing
this while achieving other important goals can only be done through rational,
unified and accountable governance."
<P>
The problems the commission identified include costs that are rising two
percent faster than inflation, inadequacies in undergraduate teaching, the
proliferation of unneeded or redundant programs and curricula, and an overall
increase in state monies going to administration instead of instruction.
<P>
The commission's recommendation has been greeted with the enthusiasm UT usually
reserves for a number-one-ranked University of Alabama football team.
<P>
"Most of these recommendations you can agree with," says Joe Johnson, president
of the UT system. "Yea, rah," he adds, his voice going flat.
<P>
The merger has been "proposed before in different legislative sessions,"
Johnson points out. "It's not new or revolutionary."
<P>
The report strategically does not suggest whether the UT system would be
swallowed up by the Board of Regents or whether UT would oversee the state
schools in places like Johnson City and Murfreesboro, but it does recommend
that each school have its own board of trustees in addition to the overall
board.
<P>
While Johnson admits that there are valid reasons to be concerned about
duplication of programs and curricula and the quality of governance in some
state schools, the president questions how a commission intent on practical
government could propose an increase in the number of boards.
<P>
"We have plenty to do. We don't need seven more institutions, or six or 10.
We wouldn't do as good a job," Johnson says.
<P>
Neither current UTK Chancellor Bill Snyder nor a predecessor, Jack Reese,
has a higher opinion of the merger proposal.
<P>
"I personally favor the UT system as it is," says Snyder, who gets high marks
on the UTK campus as a competent, progressive administrator. "It's a good,
solid system that is working well." He denies that combining the two systems
would generate savings in money or personnel.
<P>
"It doesn't make any sense," says Reese, who presided over a reduction in
enrollment that has let UT set higher standards for its undergraduate student
body. "The people favoring it are assuming greater efficiency. But historically,
practically, that's not true."
<P>
"UT is a good size. It's large enough to be efficient," says Reese, but still
small enough to make the campuses in the system accessible to the system
administration.
<P>
Others in state government evidently share UT's dislike for the commission's
idea.
<P>
"Dead in the water," reports Ziegler after her return last week from meetings
with the state legislature's Black Caucus.
<P>
And the official many UT folk thought would support the recommendation is
also not impressed. Smith, the chancellor of the state Board of Regents,
opposes any talk of merger, pointing out that problems within the Board of
Regents system are being addressed.
<P>
"What we have today is the result of thoughtful and deliberative decision-making
based on detailed review of well-documented studies," Smith recently told
a legislative oversight committee. "Evolution rather than revolution has
produced the system in place today.
<P>
"In my judgment both UT and TBR boards have about as much on our plates as
either can realistically and effectively manage."
<P>
Ron Terry, the Memphis banker who chaired the commission, disputes both the
"dead on arrival" judgments and the criticisms of the merger recommendation.
<P>
He describes the current dual-governance setup as a 20-year-old political
decision "to set up two competing systems of higher education with a referee
in between [the Tennessee Higher Education Commission] that had no teeth."
<P>
"It was basically done to avoid the political opposition of the leadership
of the University of Tennessee," Smith says. He notes that the current
arrangement was meant to limit lobbying of the Legislature by individual
campuses, to control the redundancy of educational programs and to rein in
the escalating costs of higher education.
<P>
"Then we had two campuses offering doctorates. Now we have six. Now every
campus has its lobbyist, and the cost of higher education is rising two percent
higher than inflation.
<P>
"Last week, members of our commission visited with the joint Senate and House
education committee. And if there was an outpouring of dissatisfaction with
the recommendation of the report, we failed to hear it," Terry says.
<P>
"The question is bigger than the University of Tennessee," says Terry, who
served a nine-year term on UT's board. "The issue is where and how we control
programs and costs most effectively, with the idea that most Tennesseans
want to ensure that there is no difference in education of students at UTK
or Middle Tennessee State."
<P>
Former UT trustee R. B. "Pete" Hailey applauds the recommendations of Terry's
commission. "I endorse the findings of that committee wholeheartedly," says
the Sevierville lawyer, whose outspokenness on the board cost him reappointment
a couple of years ago. "The entire educational system should be carefully
looked at. Many of the things in the report are good."
<H3>Whither UT?
</H3><P>For the men at the top of the UT structure, the future of the school
looks rosy.
<P>
"I'm very comfortable with the university, where it is and where it's going,"
says Haslam, one of UT's most influential trustees, who has served since
1980. "I think the University of Tennessee is functioning very well."
<P>
For Haslam and Johnson, the university has achieved a stable organization
and is making commendable progress. They have no doubts about UT's future,
even when they are no longer in control.
<P>
But the pressures of retirement, the legislative mandate and the merger
recommendation--coupled with the likelihood that the university's level of
state funding will not see significant growth in the future--leaves the
university more open to sweeping change than it has been in 40 years.
<P>
Terry seems to have the clearest vision of that possibility when he talks
of the changes in national politics that have taken place in the last year.
He also points to the final recommendation in the educational section of
the report, the suggestion that Knoxville's UT Medical Center be cut loose
financially from the UT system.
<P>
"When I was a trustee, one question was what are we doing with responsibility
for a great big hospital in Knoxville," he says. UT officials justified it
on the basis of the revenue it raised and the needs of graduate medical
education. Now UT itself has signed off on the need to distance itself from
the center.
<P>
To those who predict that the Practical Government report will never fly,
he offers a simple warning that could sum up UT's future:
<P>
"Things change."

</H1><P><STRONG>The godmother of women's basketball polishes 'The Princess of Hoop'</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Brooks Clark</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>With 3:52 to go and the score tied at 63-63, UT's Michelle Marciniak is just inside the three-point line, one-on-one with Louisiana Tech guard Kendra
Neal.
<P> "Take her!" exhorts coach Pat Summit from the bench.
<P> Marciniak charges around Neal, reverses direction and goes up for a turnaround
jumper. The crowd of 11,188 stands and loses its collective mind. The Lady Vols were not only going to upset the number one team in the nation, they were on fire.
<P> "You talk about being in the zone," says Marciniak. "I hit that little turnaround
jumper, and when the crowd went nuts, I got chills as I was running down the court I felt it so much. All I knew at that point was my teammates and
winning that ball game."
<P> What was apparent that evening, and had been apparent in the 77-72 upset of No. 2 Vanderbilt three nights earlier, was that a chemical reaction was taking place. The same team that had been ambushed by Stanford, Connecticut and Georgia had shown that on the right night it could beat anyone. The elements
include six-foot-two forward Chamique Holdsclaw, a freshman who has improved from fabulous to unstoppable in two months; scoring guard Latina Davis, whose
heroics on a sprained ankle sparked the victory over Vanderbilt; and forward Abby Conklin, who provided 12 clutch points in the second half against the
Techsters.
<P> But the heartbeat, the leader, the quarterback, who holds in her hands exactly
how far this team can go, is Marciniak."
<P> "Great point guards will have a team in the palm of their hand and bring a team to another level," says Summitt. "I say that about coaches. But with this particular team, I think Michelle can really have a lot of influence on the destiny of this team."
<P> Over the next month and a half, it will also become clear that Marciniak, who made honorable-mention All-America last year, has reached the moment when she can realize her basketball potential, combining the Pete Maravich
ball-handling, the desire, and the ability to make the team play together and believe.
<P> I want a championship so bad it hurts," she sighs.
<P> Marciniak has always had plenty of flash. As a senior at Allentown (Pa.) Central Catholic High, she was featured in the 1991 Sports Illustrated swimsuit
issue in a story entitled "The Ponytailed Princess of Hoop." She has always
carried a picture of Michael Jordan in her sock, and her signature spin move
earned her the title "Spinderella." No-look passes. Behind the back passes. Long passes.
<P> Not exactly Pat Summitt basketball.
<P> "I'm sure it's been hard for her to play for me," says Summitt, "and at times
it's been a real challenge for me to coach her, because I expect perfection, and her style does not always lend itself to that type of game. Michelle had a lot of what I would call street ball in her game. She does a lot
instinctively, and sometimes she doesn't have a conscience with the ball. But when you're the point guard you have to learn to play one possession at a time and take into account situations, time, score, all of the above, not just go play. This has been a process in which Michelle has learned to look at four other players and what she needs to bring to them to make them play better. It's a mental game, not a physical game at that point. I've been really tough on her, but I think Michelle knows why. I see the potential for her to be one of the best point guards to play in this program, one of the best point guards nationally."
<P> "Pat was determined to make me her point guard," says a grateful Spinderella,
"and she's put everything on the line for me. She's held me. She's yelled at me. She's fussed at me. She's screamed at me. She's patted me on the back.
She's hugged my neck."
<H3>Spinderella and Her Coaching Godmother
</H3><P>Marciniak grew up in Macungie, Pa., playing one-on-one with her older
brother, Steve. Her father, Whitey, was a fullback at Maryland; her mother,
Betsy, a cheerleader there. Michelle played golf, soccer, softball and
volleyball, and scored 3,025 points in her high school basketball career. She was a two-time Parade All-America and Gatorade, Naismith, and Street &amp; Smith's player of the year.
<P> Summitt has said from time to time that Marciniak was destined to play at UT. This feeling comes in part from Summitt's 1990 recruiting trip to the
Marciniak home. Summitt, then seven and a half months pregnant, had just begun to describe the glories of Lady Vols basketball when her water broke. She quickly caught a plane home to make sure that her son Tyler was born in Tennessee.
<P> In Marciniak's senior year, Summitt was also in the process of recruiting a class that included several others from that same Parade All-America
team--Vonda Ward, Dana Johnson and USA Today's player of the year, Tiffany
Woosley--along with forward Nikki McCray.
<P> "I really liked Michelle the first time I saw her play," says Summitt. "I think she was in the ninth grade at an AAU tournament. I just loved her game and I thought she would be a great player for our program and a good fit.
<P> "As we went through the recruiting process I wasn't so sure, because Tiffany
Woosley was coming here, and with the returning players we had and the players we signed with that class, I just wasn't so sure, with Michelle's game and her desire to be a go-to player and make the difference for a program. I've
always said that as a great high school player you can be a showboat, or come here and be on the showboat. I think Michelle really felt like being the showboat--and I don't mean that in a negative way at all. She wanted to be that go-to player. She wanted the responsibility of being the impact person at Notre Dame. She had to experience that to know she wanted to come
aboard a traditionally strong program."
<P> Says Marciniak, "I took the other route. I already took the fancy,
do-whatever-you-want-to-do route, and I lost 17 times, and that's not what I want in my college career." 
<P> After a year at Notre Dame, Marciniak transferred to Tennessee and sat out the 1992-93 season. In 1993-94 she backed up Tiffany Woosley at point guard and played mostly the number two guard, wowing the crowds with flashes of
showtime and often getting her feelings hurt.
<P> "I didn't know how to take Pat," Marciniak says. "I took everything personally.
She would yell at me and I'd cry. I was going through a whole change. We were both trying to change the way I looked at the game, how I saw the game and approached the game, and on top of that she was yelling at me and fussing at me and I didn't know how to handle it. It's experience and maturity. Now she yells at me, I say, 'OK, I got it,' and I go back and do what I was supposed
to do."
<H3>Yours If You Want It
</H3><P>Then came the Mideast Regional playoff game against Louisiana Tech. The entire team, perhaps looking ahead to the Final Four, was flat. With the team behind by 17, Marciniak came off the bench to spark a rally, scoring 17 points, including three free throws in a row in the final seconds before the Lady Vols finally succumbed 68-71. As she got on the bus, Summitt said to Lady Vols publicist Debbie Jennings that "there are going to be some changes
in the line-up."
<P> "First of all, in that game they keyed on our starting point guard," says
Summitt, "and when Michelle came into the game she posed some problems for
them--regardless of their speed and quickness, she physically could hold her own. Secondly, we made a run with her on the floor. I saw a competitiveness
and an attitude under adversity that I thought would enhance her ability to be a point guard. We talked within a day and I just said, 'You're going to be my point guard.'"
<P> "It was after that game that I knew she believed in me," says Marciniak. "She saw something in me that she really liked, and she took a chance with me. I'm not a true point guard. I'd never played point guard for a full game in my life up until last year. I'd played the two all through high school. She just said, 'The team is yours if you want it.' After Pat told me that, it was all over for me. I was so excited. I worked my butt off in the summer. I was totally psyched."
<H3>Pat on the Floor
</H3><P>The point guard is the hardest position to play on a Pat Summitt team. "You've got to have a thick skin," says assistant coach Holly Warlick, who defined the position when she played between 1976 and '80. "You've got to be able to accept the criticism."
<P> "I know for me that's where I start," says Summitt. "I look at the point guard as an extension of the coach. If it's broke, you fix it. If it's not, you get a lot of credit. Therefore there are a lot of expectations at that spot. We look at tapes and we look at execution and invariably I come back and I say, 'It starts with you.'"
<P> How much does Pat Summitt expect from a point guard? One example came during last year's title game against Connecticut. At one point in the first half,
Marciniak zipped a long pass to center Dana Johnson under the hoop. After the ball went through Johnson's hands, the CBS-TV national audience saw Summitt
chide Marciniak.
<P> "In that play," says Summitt, "I felt like you have to know who's receiving the basketball. That's a part of being a point guard. To me it's like a
quarterback: This guy's not fast enough to run under a ball and catch it; this player doesn't have the hands to complete the play. You've got to deliver it right on target. Michelle just over-led on that play. But the whole thing was that when she passed the ball, she made a 30-foot pass. We're constantly
talking about shortening your passes. That needed to be about a 12- to 15-foot
pass."
<P> "I pretty much get the brunt of everything," says Marciniak cheerfully. "If
there's a pass to the post and they don't catch it, for the most part, most of the time, it was because I didn't deliver the ball to them at the right time or to the right spot. I've accepted that. That's my role on this team--to
give them a perfect pass--and if it's not perfect, then it's not good enough.
I've just learned to handle the fact that Dana didn't catch the pass and Pat yelled at me. I've learned to accept that."
<P> An example in black and white came during Marciniak's comeback against Louisiana
Tech two years ago. "She'd just hit a three and she gave up a lay-up," explains
Summitt. "As she ran by me I grabbed her uniform and I said, 'You don't hit a three and give up a lay-up.'"
<P> That scene--ponytailed Spinderella cruelly castigated by the evil stepmother--was
captured by a photographer and disseminated across the country on the Associated
Press wire.
<P> "I got a couple of nasty letters and phone calls," says Summitt. "I called her mom--we have a great relationship there--and told her, 'I promise it wasn't child abuse.'
<P> "It's really interesting," Summitt continues, "because you have to be on the inside to know how we function here. I think we have a special relationship,
our staff and our players, in that it's tough love at times. Discipline is tough love at times. In coaching you have to have a combination. They know that when you step over the line onto the court, you're a player. When you step off the court, now you're a person, and there are times when we may be dealing with problems academically or personally or whatever, but you have to be able to switch those roles and understand where we're coming from.
<P> "Michelle is a terrific competitor. She's a hard worker. She's also a very
sensitive person. I'm sure at times my style has probably been very hard on her. But I think the important thing is she knows I care very much about her as a person. I think you can handle criticism better when you know it's
coming from someone who really cares about you. You know, your mom and dad can hurt your feelings but you know they love you, and that's important."
<P> Marciniak took the AP picture of herself and Summitt and taped it to the
dashboard of her red '91 Honda Prelude.
<P> "It was there all last year. I didn't really understand why I put it there," says Marciniak who graduated in December with a B.S. in psychology "I mean, why would you put a picture like that on the dashboard of your car so you see it every day? I think it was there for a reason and the reason was
motivation. Pat really wants this for me very badly, and I just have to keep
plugging no matter how hard it gets. In a warped kind of way that's the way I interpreted that picture."
<P> It may have surprised both Summitt the disciplinarian and Marciniak the wild pony when they compared results on the Predictive Index personality test and saw in objective measure how many character traits they actually have in common.
<P> "We're very similar in that we are very competitive people," says Summitt. "We have a high energy level, strong work ethic, hate to lose, love to work with other people. Because there are a lot of similarities in our personalities,
it's almost like there are times I know what she's going to do before she does it, and she probably knows what I'm going to say before I say it."
<P> "I think ever since we found that out," says Marciniak, "she just expected a whole lot from me, because that's how she would react if she were in my shoes."
<P> Summitt may also have more in common with Marciniak as a player than she lets on.
<P> "Pat's not one to talk about her playing days," said Holly Warlick in a 1994
newspaper story. "But one time she went on what a great passer she was, how she hates fancy stuff, only like fundamental passes. So toward the end of a film session a few days later [assistant coach] Mickie [DeMoss] and I slipped
in a tape of her playing for UT-Martin. It was hilarious. She was throwing hook passes and all this crazy stuff."
<P> "I'd like to see those tapes," says Marciniak.
<H3>Spinderella at the Ball
</H3><P>Last season the Lady Vols ran into a Connecticut team of destiny that would not be beaten. The Huskies' 35-0 season and the accompanying hoopla
rocketed women's basketball into a new era as a featured sport. Rebecca Lobo was featured in People magazine. ESPN signed to cover regular-season games for the first time. The tickets for this year's title game--an event that didn't always sell out just three years ago--were gone last April.
<P> Against the Huskies, Marciniak went nose to nose and kneepad to kneepad with
All-America point guard Jen Rizzotti, who played 39 minutes out of 40 and, with the scored tied 61-61 with 1:51 to go, took a long rebound at the top of the key, spun Marciniak with a crossover dribble and drove the length of the court for the go-ahead lay-up. In a remarkable piece of sportsmanship,
Marciniak wrote her a note afterward saying, "Congratulations. You deserved it."
<P> "What Jen has been able to do is make big plays in close games," says Summitt,
"and to me Michelle has been able to do that in our last two games [Vanderbilt
and Louisiana Tech] by getting the ball to the right people at  the right time and, if they're not open, making the shot. The other thing Rizzotti does is to bring a competitiveness and a confidence to that team, conveying to everyone, 'Hey, we're not losing.' And I've seen that in Michelle. Her
physical stature (five feet nine inches) is really an asset at that position.
She's not one to be intimidated or bumped around. She brings a lot of confidence
to our team just with her body language."
<P> At times Marciniak moves like John Wayne in Hondo. Other times she sways her shoulders like Popeye. Her play is always physical: "I've always got welts and bruises I don't even remember getting," she says.
<P> Last season Marciniak kept the words "Finish" and "Leader" on her wristband. They refer to completing plays offensively and defensively, and her mission as field general: "To make the people on the floor with me better. To be a leader, not just some of the time but all the time."
<P> That mission is essential to this year's Lady Vols because they are young.
<P> "Last year Michelle didn't have to worry about raising everybody's level of play," observes Summitt, "because she was playing with one of the most
talented teams in the history of our program. McCray was there every night. Dana Johnson was there every night. We had a lot of weapons. She probably didn't realize how easy she had it."
<P> The all-star team atmosphere had its disadvantages, too. "There was a lot of unspoken pressure last year," says Marciniak. "You just knew it." (Not
surprising when the motto for the year was "One Team, One Goal.")
<P> "Even though we had a pretty good chemistry last year," says Marciniak, "we've
got an even better chemistry with our entire team this year. This year we knew we were going to be the underdogs going into the season, so that was our mindset; and it's probably going to be our mindset for the rest of the year, no matter what. And we've all kind of meshed together."
<P> That has occurred in the past several weeks. "I started out the first half of the season being real intense," says Marciniak. "If we needed a kick in the butt out there, I'd give it to whoever wasn't playing well or I'd say, look, you need to do this or do that. Whereas, in the last few games I started
taking a different approach. I decided to get in the huddle and calm everybody
down--just say we're doing a good job or we're not doing a good job. I'm using a different tone right now, and I think it really helped, since we won three very big games. I think that had a positive effect because I guess
Pat's the one who does the butt-kicking and yelling and screaming. I didn't do that, but I think my tone sometimes made everybody nervous."
<P> That makes sense, considering the personalities involved. The two guard, Latina Davis, doesn't say much on the court. "Latina will show you through her actions that she wants to win and that she loves this game," says Marciniak.
Centers Tiffani Johnson and Pashen Thompson are by nature (in Summitt's judgment)
passive and need below-the-hoop aggressiveness drawn out of them.
<P> The key to the postseason may well be Chamique Holdsclaw, who came from Christ
the King High in Queens, N.Y., as the most highly recruited player in the nation and last week became the first woman ever to be cited as ESPN's player of the week. But she admits that earlier in the season she was tentative, as in "Oh, let me see what Latina, Michelle and the upperclassmen will do."
Against Louisiana Tech she scored 23 points, grabbed 13 rebounds and prompted
Lady Techsters coach Leon Barmore to compare her to Cheryl Miller, one of the greatest female players ever. For the Lady Vols to make the Final Four,
Holdsclaw must continue to produce like a seasoned veteran.
<P> "Michelle's a psychology major," says Summitt, "so she should be able to
experiment and figure out something. I think the important thing we're seeing is that she's making an effort to get everybody else better."
<H3>A Little Rope
</H3><P>The other day Marciniak slipped the wrong tape into the video machine and saw herself playing at Notre Dame.
<P> "It's just like night and day," she says. "You can't even compare the way I'm playing now to the way I was playing out of high school."
<P> Still, there's a time for the flash. "There are times when I don't want her to be so structured that she's not aggressive and attacking," says Summitt. "When she's in her zone and she's clicking, then I just need to shut up. Late in the Vanderbilt game she made that spin move, and she knows I don't like the spin move, and in the film session I said, 'Even I thought that was a nice move.' I want to give her some leeway, or give her some rope, so to speak, but I want to have a hold of the end of it just in case I have to pull it back. Having a player like that is a great challenge because she can do a lot of things with a basketball, she can bring to the floor a style
unlike any point guard that I've had."
<P> And the work continues: "What I recognized about Michelle's game is that up until this year she shot three-pointers or lay-ups. So we've tried to create a short game for her. She's not been a rebounder for us at all, so we've tried to get her on the boards more this season. I think I understand her better. I think she understands the game of basketball better. She'd make a good coach."
<P> After this year, Marciniak will continue to play basketball, perhaps in pro
leagues abroad. There's one spot open on this summer's U.S. Olympic team, but it will probably go to six-foot-seven center Kara Wolters of Connecticut.
<P> "The year 2000 is my goal," says Marciniak. "I've played USA Basketball for seven years. In the year 2000 it will be the Olympics or not be the Olympics.
I've got four more years, good years, left in me."

</H1><P><STRONG>The kids are waiting and the agencies that help them are
changing</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Janet Tate</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>It's ironic, deplorable, maybe even diabolical. In recent weeks, we've watched as some of our troubled teens become fodder for crime headlines, gaining their 15 minutes of fame in daring robberies and brutal killings. We follow reports about killer kids with fear and disgust and, yes, with a degree of morbid fascination: How much worse can it get? Will it endanger me or my loved ones?
<P> Yet most of us know next to nothing about the systems our state has put together
to rescue children, to heal families, to protect the vulnerable and to
rehabilitate the kids who have already strayed past the bounds of law and order,  and of decency.
<P> While we read the news reports and sigh, major changes in Tennessee's treatment
of its children are under way or in the planning stage, virtually invisible to the general public but reshaping and sometimes disrupting the child-care
bureaucracy.
<H3>Tennessee Tragic
</H3><P>It's Dickensian, yet it's the stuff of modern American tragedy: There are now more than 10,000 children in the custody of the state of Tennessee--4,000
more than there were just a few years ago. According to a 1994 report from
Attorney General Janet Reno, Tennessee has the most children in state custody,
per capita, of any state in the union.
<P> What's worse, many of our kids sit for months in group homes and shelters before receiving the help they need to get out of state custody one day, or at least go on to recapture some semblance of a normal childhood.
<P> "The number of children in the system is threatening to bring the system down," says Susan Kovac, a Department of Human Services lawyer who represents
children that are placed in state custody. "The ability of the state to deal with children in custody is limited by a lack of resources and a change over the last decade in the types of children the state is being asked to raise."
<P> Judge Charles Sexton, who handles juvenile matters in Sevier County, agrees. "We have too many children and nowhere to put them; they're waiting in line
forever for appropriate services."
<P> This week in the 24-county region of central and northern East Tennessee, some 167 children are awaiting a residential placement of some sort, according to Roselee Siegler, the director of the assessment and care coordination team for Knox County. These children are already in state custody, having
received some sort of evaluation or treatment, but have no place to go to get the next appropriate step in their treatment.
<P> The biggest shortage is in regular foster homes, therapeutic foster homes, and group homes for the least needy children, Siegler says.
<H3>The System That Will Change
</H3><P>Children who are in so much trouble that they need state intervention
have historically been handled by one of one of four departments of the state
bureaucracy, depending on how the child comes to the state's attention.
<P> The Department of Human Services is the agency with which most people are
familiar; it takes custody of children with a gamut of problems. Babies and young children most often come to DHS, usually because of abuse or neglect. They receive a medical assessment, and perhaps a battery of psychological tests if emotional or developmental problems are suspected. Then they move on fairly quickly to a foster home, perhaps after a brief stay at a children's
shelter such as the local Catholic Services' Columbus Home here in Knoxville.
<P> It's a different story for older kids and teens. These children may be runaways;
they may have been deemed unruly or truant by a juvenile judge. Or maybe, as in Naomi's case (see sidebar), the parent or guardian has exhausted her
insurance and can't afford the mental health program the child desperately needs.
<P> Truants who refuse to go to school are often placed in the custody of the
Department of Education, usually at its residential facility in Nashville, the Tennessee Preparatory School.
<P> Teens with emotional problems or mental impairment may come into the custody of the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation. But children that run afoul of the law often find themselves in the custody of the Department of Youth Development, which uses such correctional facilities as Mountain View in Jefferson County.
<H3>There'll Be a Short Wait
</H3><P>Once teens come into state custody, they most likely go onto a waiting
list for mental-health services. The number of available slots is so limited and the list so long that a four- to five-month wait in a youth shelter is now the rule rather than the exception. (Naomi is lucky. She has family members
who persistently fought the system to get her the help she needed. Because of her grandmother's dogged efforts, a bed at Peninsula was more or less waiting for her when her seemingly inevitable crisis occurred, and she went
straight from juvenile hall to a treatment facility. Most kids don't get that kind of service.)
<P> And whether it's to Columbus Home or the Youth Emergency Shelter in Morristown or some other "holding tank," the state pays a board rate for each child in custody while the wait for a placement slot drags on.
<P> Of course, it's not inevitable that a troubled child will wind up a ward of the state. Many early-intervention and preventive programs exist, administered
by communities who strive to help an at-risk child before state custody becomes a reality. These include Home Ties, a family preservation program run by DHS; the Regional Intervention Program; and Basic, a school-based program for children with emotional and behavioral disorders. There are also
juvenile-court intervention programs. But it's often up to the family to seek these programs out, through local health departments, say, or the school's
guidance counselors, or simply by calling the Department of Human Services.
<P> Even for families who can overcome the denial of the fact that their child is in jeopardy (too often coupled with the perhaps shameful feeling that they've somehow failed) and seek out services, preventive and intervention
programs are obviously no panacea. The best of intentions and the most capably
applied resources can scarcely undo in a few weeks or months problems that have often taken years to evolve and surface.
<H3>Dumping on the State
</H3><P>But why is the state responsible for so many children, and why now?
<P> "My sense is that a lot of parents are just dumping these kids," Kovac says
flatly. "We see adopted kids who get to be 14 and they're not cute little babies anymore, so the adoptive parents say, 'I'm not doing this anymore.' That's rare, but it happens.
<P> "We see parents who obviously have different priorities," she continues. "Mom's got a new boyfriend, or Dad doesn't want to spend any more money, or the parent is just fed up.
<P> "Yes, it's harder to raise teenagers than it used to be, and being a teenager is harder than it used to be. But the notion that as a parent you have the option of just turning your child over to the state--there's a lot more of that than there was 20 years ago."
<P> Another key player in this scenario is the juvenile court judge, many of whom are less and less reluctant to turn truant or unruly kids over to the state.
<P> "The demographics show that [the] children in state custody, instead of being
primarily neglected and abused children who are growing up in foster care, are more and more coming in as unruly or delinquent teenagers," Kovac notes.
<P> As a result, there's no shortage of people in state government who then turn
around and blame the courts for the influx of kids in custody. It's an attitude
that enrages many judges, who would point out that they don't put a child into state custody unless it's the absolute last resort; and that when they do so, it's because they've exercised their responsibility in determining that a child meets the legal guidelines to be in custody.
<P> Sexton says that Tennessee's Children's Plan, put in place during the
administration of former governor Ned McWherter, actually required judges to send children into custody.
<P> "When the Children's Plan was devised, it was called on to work miracles," Sexton says. "Many kids we would have dealt with locally are now sent through the state system. And it has nowhere near enough resources--not enough money or service providers."
<H3>Wanted: A Culprit
</H3><P>Can we blame the government for being ineffective, uncaring, and
hopelessly scattered when it comes to providing state services to kids in
trouble? It would be satisfying to find a bad guy in all this, particularly in government, but it's not as though the governor's office is clueless or
uncaring.
<P> Five years old, the Children's Plan was intended to make the children's services
delivery system more family-oriented and more community-based, to stem the flow of children coming into state custody, and to get the state's act together
in deciding which kid needed exactly what kind of help and how much.
<P> The plan gave birth to community health agencies known as assessment care and coordination teams (ACCTs), which took over from the usual departments (DHS, DYD, etc.) the task of coming up with what's known as a plan of care for each child. The local ACCTs would decide, for example, how serious a child's mental or behavioral problems were, and thus which facility (Camelot,
Peninsula, or Lakeshore, for example) would best meet the child's needs; monitor the child's progress; and ultimately decide where the child would
go--back home or up for adoption--once the services had been rendered.
<P> Implementation of the Children's Plan has been haphazard at best, with
expectations often clashing with performance. Sexton says the McWherter
administration assumed that it could get bargain-priced services because service providers like psychologists and treatment programs would cut their rates by 60 to 70 percent in order to get a steady stream of the state's
guaranteed business.
<P> "It didn't happen. The providers weren't willing to cut rates," Sexton says. As a result, the available services have too frequently not met the level of need.
<P> "Sometimes we give too little to kids, and sometimes too much--say, more
intensive intervention than is needed, perhaps because very often there's not another place for them to be," says Charlotte Bryson, former director for Child and Adolescent Services for the Department of Mental Health and now executive director of the nonprofit organization Tennessee Voices for
Children, which was founded by Tipper Gore in 1990. "Tennessee was beginning to develop a system of care so that we'd have a whole continuum [of services], to try to right-size the system for everybody. But it was a fragile system, and it's not been developed thoroughly throughout the state."
<P> Reviews of the ACCTs have been mixed. Some complain that lack of cooperation, if not downright hostility, between the teams and the various departments that used to handle the caseloads rendered delivery of services nearly
impossible. Some charge that monitoring of the care plans has been inadequate.
Still, the Tennessee Commission on Children and Youth's 1994 evaluation of the Children's Plan recommended, among other things, that support for the ACCTs continue, with the proviso that the turf conflicts end and collaborative
training take place. 
<H3>Sundquist's Sequel
</H3><P>Now it's 1996, and we have a new administration and a new plan of action. On the same snowy January weekend that Naomi was cooling her heels in juvenile hall, Governor Sundquist signed his own executive order, approving
the consolidation of all of Tennessee's children's services into one big
department. How that will take place, what improvements (if any) will be wrought, where priorities will be placed, and how funding will shake out is all spelled out in an 80-page bill the governor has prepared for the
Legislature.
<P> For the time being, the Department of Health has become a sort of holding tank for the folding-in of programs and services, as the state studies ways to eliminate duplication of services and to streamline efforts. Children's
advocates and other observers are cautiously optimistic.
<P> "You have children who have been in DYD custody and children who have been in DHS custody competing for the same services, and one or the other gets it, depending on whose caseworker could move faster," says Kovac of the way
services are currently administered. "There's no question that pulling together
all the different services to children and having them actually coordinated is a good thing. If you don't address any of the other problems, that alone
surely will help. "
<P> The consolidation plan, overseen at the present time by Nancy Minke of the
governor's office, is now wending its way through the legislative process, and it's hoped that a cohesive structure will be in place by July--the beginning
of the new fiscal year.
<P> "The program itself is still in the works," says Minke, "but, in general, the governor's focusing on community prevention initiatives in the particular
areas of teen pregnancy, school dropout, substance abuse, and crime."
<P> Sexton was one of several East Tennessee juvenile judges who called Minke before them in Morristown last November. Seated in the jury box, the judges
listened to Minke, then aired their own gripes and complaints, giving her what Sexton calls "hard-core, eye-opening scenarios."
<P> "The juvenile judges are very much in favor of a unified system," Sexton says. "No one is kicking about that. They're kicking about how to implement it." The juvenile judges and all the other players will be studying the Sundquist
legislation closely to see how priorities will be set in the jostling for state funds.
<P> "There's no question about it. We need to be preventing more and treating less," Sexton says. "But the new plan won't be a cure-all. None of us has a magic wand."
<P> Says Linda O'Neal of the Tennessee Commission on Children and Youth: "It's
important that the system focus on providing services at the most family-focused
and community-based level possible. And certainly, whenever possible, we need to be involved in early intervention. I think it's always a fear and a danger that early-intervention programs will suffer. We've seen some success
with those programs in recent years, and there's increased awareness of their
value and importance, and we just have to be vigilant and not let that happen."
<P> Which doesn't banish the fear that the number of slots for kids in need will
shrink further. It's a balancing act, one being contemplated at a time when there are already more children in the system than can be handled adequately.
Furthermore, these children are often caught between spiraling medical costs and a political climate that fosters an intensifying abhorrence of the government
doing anything for its people--even its children.
<P> If prevention becomes the priority, will slots for kids already in the system
decrease--at a time when there's already a shortage?
<P> "What we need to be doing is increasing those services throughout the state, so I'm concerned we might lose ground if we don't do it appropriately and
coordinate the system," says Bryson. "The yardstick for that is if we can have a system in which children get what they need and only what they need from the state--if we can create a system that can provide services more
efficiently for families and services for children when they need them, and that they're out of the system when they don't need them."
<P> Some hope the Sundquist administration will learn from other states' mistakes.
<P> "Other states are showing that their consolidations of children's services have not been the cure-all they hoped it would be," says Bryson. "So other states have learned the hard way that if you don't build in some real good
safeguards, what tends to happen is that children with mental-health needs lose out and don't get the resources they had before."
<P> "One of the problems in the system historically has been to look for a silver
bullet--one-service answers," says O'Neal. "And many times what we need is a case-management process that brings together a range of services that might be needed--psychotherapy, intensive counseling, parenting classes, or working
one-on-one with the families to help develop some behavior modification plans....
It's whatever it takes in an individual case, and that's part of the challenge.
There are no cookie-cutter answers."
<P> ACCT director Siegler agrees. "Each one of us has a role in preventing or
intervening in problems. Parents have a legal and moral obligation to the
children. And the community needs to support young families.
<P> "It doesn't have to be professional support. We must take ownership of the
problems in our own community."

<H3>A Year in the Life of Naomi
</H3><P><STRONG>The True Story of a Teen, Her Grandmother, and the Agencies
Around Them</STRONG>
<P> <EM>(Names have been changed for confidentiality.)</EM>
<P> January, 1995: Naomi, my 12-year-old granddaughter, is coming to live with me. She was less than a year old when her parents divorced, and since then she's been cared for by either my sisters or me. She and her mother have never really bonded, and she has never seen her father. Martha, my daughter, will retain legal custody, since she can cover Naomi under her health insurance.
I can put food on the table--I work in a professional office--but I can't afford everything.
<P> February, 1995: Naomi's hormones must be kicking in. She's always been emotional
and somewhat defiant, but her mother was never like this. Today, for example, I let her go to movies with her friends. When I picked her up she wanted to go over to her friend's house. I had to say no, and she started screaming at me, right there in the parking lot. For two hours she was hysterical. It's just getting worse and worse. I called Martha and told her I thought Naomi needed some counseling, and Martha said okay, her insurance had provisions
for that.
<P> March, 1995: Naomi is seeing a counselor once a week. She's so unhappy; she just wants to sleep all the time. The counselor says she believes Naomi is deeply depressed, and might benefit from antidepressant medication.
<P> May, 1995: Naomi's medication seems to be working; it's taken away a lot of her unhappiness, and she's much more upbeat. But her behavior is getting out of control. She's becoming more and more defiant, staying out late, and not telling me where she's going. I'm afraid she may even be experimenting with drugs.
<P> July, 1995: We've had a very bad incident. Naomi slapped me, and said she wanted to kill me. It's very frightening, but I'm also afraid Naomi is going to harm herself. With the help of her counselor, we got her into St. Mary's CAPs unit, an in-patient treatment program. They're trying different sorts of medications on her, which I don't like. I know they're truly trying to help Naomi, and their hands are tied, too; they only have a week, fifteen days maybe, to try to figure out what to do with this girl. I'm just afraid
shoving in all these different medications like this can do more harm than good.
<P> August, 1995: Naomi's insurance has capped out. Martha talked with the people at St. Mary's, and under the circumstances we were able to get TennCare's Blue Cross program to pick up payment. That means she can stay another week, but then that's it.
<P> September, 1995: School has started back. Naomi's still seeing her counselor, but she's becoming more and more uncooperative in her sessions. She's also
starting to stay out at night, and I don't know where she is, she won't call me. Her counselor has put us in touch with a Department of Human Services program called Home Ties. They'll send a counselor out every day for the next 30 days to work with me and Naomi.
<P> Her counselor also recommended we get a second opinion from a psychiatrist, which we did. His opinion was pretty scary. He recommended total in-patient care for Naomi, like at Camelot or Peninsula. He said, "She's not an accident
waiting to happen; it's happening already." Naomi's counselor called Camelot and Peninsula, but neither one would accept TennCare's Blue Cross coverage. So here we sit. We have nobody to help her, because she doesn't have the right insurance. Naomi's counselor is keeping the wheels going, but we're fast running out of options.
<P> The Home Ties counselor came one night for the appointment. Naomi never showed
up. At this point, the counselors told me, we had no other option but to go through the legal system. It's the one thing I've fought and dreaded. We had to go to juvenile court and file a petition on Naomi as being "out of control" and "a runaway." We called the police, and they did go and find her, and I think it shook her up a little bit.
<P> At the end of Home Ties' 30-day program, I asked for 15 more days; sometimes
they'll do that, and I thought the counselor was actually starting to make some headway with Naomi. He tried very hard. But they couldn't extend the
program. So now our 30 days with them are up.
<P> November, 1995: One of the juvenile court supervisors told me we should try to get Naomi into Helen Ross McNabb or the Lighthouse [a day program for
emotionally troubled children]--anything, wherever they will take her.
<P> We went down to Peninsula with all of Naomi's records and went through the
precertification process. All that red tape, it seems like it took hours. And then the receptionist there came out and said, "I'm sorry, TennCare-Blue
Shield says Naomi isn't violent enough; they won't allow her to be admitted." She met all of Peninsula's criteria, but Blue Shield decides she's not "violent
enough"? Everyone is telling us to get this girl into a treatment program, yet no one will take her.
<P> I'm at my wit's end. I'm afraid I'll end up in Peninsula before Naomi does. If she commits a crime, the state will take her and treat her. In other words, if she had done harm to me, she'd be there right now. In desperation I called one of the other counselors I've dealt with along the way. He said, unbelievably,
"Well, just lock her out of the house, let her walk the streets, then if she commits a crime, we'll see what we can do." That's the way the system works? I want help for this girl before she becomes tomorrow's headlines, and I'm told no way?
<P> January, 1996: Naomi stayed out all night again last night. I called Martha;
Martha called the school. Surprisingly, there she was, in math class. Since we already had a petition filed on her at juvenile court, the police went and picked her up, took her out of class, and she went directly to juvenile hall. Three days later, as a ward of the state, she went straight to Peninsula
Village.
<P>  I never wanted this. Naomi's counselor told me from the beginning, though: if all else fails, the state will have to take her. I tried in every way I could to avoid this, but here we are.
<P> I saw Naomi two weeks later for the first time since she left. We talked for about three minutes. She looked scared and nervous. She asked me when she can get out. I don't know what to tell her, and neither does anyone else. It really all depends on Naomi now.

</H1><P><STRONG>The idea folks have come, but Knoxville's future depends on people with capital to invest</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Joe Sullivan</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>Ever since Schriver's landmark men's clothing store shut down in 1993, the moribund Gay Street storefront has been one more reminder of the ghost-town
aura that hangs over much of the city's core.
<P> This week, though, the premises have temporarily become a beehive buzzing with grand designs for bringing new vitality to the downtown. If a three-day
assemblage of planners can provide the stimulus to overcome three decades of stagnation, the group that's convening here is well-prepared for the task.
<P> Joining a local contingent of downtown boosters, architects and city officials is an imposing array of consultants from across the land. The head of Harvard
University's urban design program is leading a team of four urban planning gurus from New Orleans, Washington, New Haven and Cambridge, Mass. A
representative of a Chicago-based economic research firm is on hand to assess the feasibility of development plans. A meeting facilitator from Nashville has been retained to preside over the group's deliberations. The city is picking up the $80,000-plus tab.
<P> The group is looking at the recommendations of three committees that have been meeting since last fall as part of a process labeled "Downtown, the Next BIG Steps." Under the aegis of the Downtown Organization, these committees
have been charged with "creating a short list of projects which will realize the vision for downtown--making downtown a beautiful place to live, work, shop and play." Looking beyond the city's waterfront development project already underway, the committees' priority list includes:
<UL><LI>A new convention center with state-of-the-art meeting rooms, banquet
facilities and other amenities. The lack of those assets has rendered the city's existing convention center unable to attract more convention-goers. The estimated cost of a new facility: $50-80 million.
<LI>A theme park and other attractions at the World's Fair Park that would make it a major tourist destination, or at least draw visitors from East
Tennessee. The estimated cost of such a development, envisioned by its backers as a high-tech and high-toned contrast to Pigeon Forge: $60-70 million.
<LI>A rail-based transit system that would circle the downtown, linking
waterfront and World's Fair Park developments with the Old City and a convention
center. In addition to serving as a people-mover, backers believe that such a train ride could become an attraction in its own right. The estimated cost of getting it to chug: $10-15 million.
<LI>Growth of downtown's residential population through rehabilitation of the long vacant 13-story Sterchi Building on Gay Street. City planners figure
$1.5 million would be required to acquire the building and renovate it to the point where some 50 unfinished shells could be sold to condominium buyers,
who would complete the interiors on their own. But the developer who has looked most closely at such an undertaking says this estimate is way too low.
<LI>Stimulation of new businesses downtown (thus increasing its work force) by creating incubator office space in vacant Gay Street buildings. Renovation of 25,000 square feet of office space at a cost of $500,000 to $1 million would house up to 25 fledgling enterprises with a total of 100 to 150 employees.
</UL><P>One thing missing from all the visionary undertakings on the BIG Steps list is any notion of who will pay for them. In the absence of investors
who are prepared to put big bucks behind them, the grand designs of our
illustrious assemblage of urban planners may prove illusory. The public
discussion--and attendant promotion--could spur investor interest that might not otherwise be forthcoming. But local developers are skeptical as to the
effectiveness of a master planning process.
<P> "You just can't force-feed these things," says former mayor Kyle Testerman. "When the time is ripe for a development, people will start coming forward with their own ideas for how to make it work." (Testerman and his wife Gloria
have just finished renovating three warehouses in the Old City as office
buildings with ground floor retail tenants.)
<P> Are there any private developers coming forward to start taking any of the BIG Steps? To what extent is local government prepared to help them, or to fund a public facility like a convention center? Beyond that, are there other
developments that hold promise of bringing vitality to the downtown?
<H3>You All Come
</H3><P>Attracting more visitors, especially from afar, may be downtown's most appealing elixir The community as a whole could benefit via tax revenues
from the dollars they would spend here, along with the establishments they would patronize. Established drawing cards range from the Dogwood Arts Festival
to exhibitions at the existing convention center to the enhanced offerings of our museums and historic sites. But Knoxville as a tourist destination pales compared to Sevier County, and most of those who come here are on day trips and thus don't fill many hotel rooms or nightspots.
<P> At downtown's four major hotels, occupancy rates, at just over 60 percent, have been languishing well below the national average of 67 percent for the past several years, says Patrick Donelly, manager of the Hyatt Regency. In his view and that of leading restaurateurs, the pulling power of a
state-of-the-art convention center would give the city its most needed boost.
<P> "You're not going to revitalize downtown without bringing in bodies that stay long enough to spend some money," Donelly asserts. As soon as a new
convention center starts going up, he predicts, a new 400-room hotel will almost certainly spring up nearby, and other new business and employment
opportunities will follow.
<P> But convention center plans have been stalled for several years over the issue of how to pay for them. City and county elected officials are not prepared
to hit property tax payers with the debt service on an $80 million bond issue.
And as much as the city's hotels and restaurants would stand to benefit, they are dug in against new taxes that would rifle-shot their businesses. Any increase in the county's five percent hotel/motel tax would make Knoxville
uncompetitive with surrounding cities, Donelly insists. Rerouting a big chunk of its $3 million annual proceeds is the way to go, he says. But this would draw fierce opposition from a host of more or less tourism-related organizations
who've become dependent on annual stipends from the hotel/motel tax take.
<P> If anyone can devise a way to break the deadlock, it's the ubiquitous James
Haslam II, who was recently name co-chairman of a convention-center steering
committee under the auspices of the Downtown Organization. But don't look for a breakthrough anytime soon.
<P> "Haslam is going to lie low on anything that involves more taxes, at least until after next November's referendum on city-county unification," says a well-placed source.
<P> Meanwhile, there's also considerable jockeying over a site for the convention
center. The World's Fair Park, once a primary candidate, has virtually been ruled out. That leaves the expansive environs of the Civic Auditorium and
Coliseum as the only other site deemed feasible by a consulting firm that
evaluated a variety of possibilities. But the president of the Downtown
Organization, Richard Cate, is reportedly striving to steer it toward a two-block
stretch that slopes eastward from the most barren part of Gay Street down to Central Avenue. While this site entails acquisition, demolition and roadway
access costs that could be avoided on the city-owned land around the coliseum, it would also give a lot more impetus to downtown revitalization.
<P> "It would be very shortsighted to let the selection process be driven by site cost differentials," says Bill Rukeyser, chairman of the BIG Steps committee
focused on downtown destinations. "If it contributed to the resurgence of a distressed part of downtown, a few million dollars of additional site cost
would pay for itself many times over in any longer run."
<H3>Park Possibilities
</H3><P>The other destination to which Rukeyser's committee hopes to encourage a lot more travel is the World's Fair Park. This 70-acre legacy from Knoxville's
1982 event is already drawing 10,000 or more to many of the bookings at its
exhibition hall, as well as to cookouts and rock concerts on its spacious lawn. But even though much of the land is earmarked for new developments, the only noteworthy opening on the site since the World's Fair closed has been the Knoxville Museum of Art. With plans for a new convention center now pointed in a different direction, the hold it had placed on other
developments appears to have been removed. But what sort of developments,
undertaken by whom and with what sources of financing?
<P> While his plans are highly tentative, one participant in the BIG Steps process
has a concept for World's Fair Park development. He is Earl Worsham, a
62-year-old Knoxville native who made his start as a developer here with projects that included a Sequoyah Hills apartment complex and the Hyatt Regency
Hotel. After moving to Atlanta in the 1970s he began operating on a global scale, with increasing emphasis in recent years on Eastern Europe. With a Russian partner, he owns 16 office buildings in Moscow, as well as properties in Estonia and Romania. Now he once again considers Knoxville home, even though he actually resides on a 3,400 acre mountain-rimmed estate near
Gatlinburg.
<P> Worsham's concept for a World's Fair Park attraction is based on the Tivoli
Gardens in Copenhagen (his wife is Danish). Tivoli combines the scenic and the festive with an array of entertainment including an amusement park. For a 21st-century-minded Knoxville, roller coasters and the like would give way to the latest in high-tech entertainment, including virtual this and
simulated that.
<P> Worsham concurs with the $50-60 million cost estimate of such an undertaking made for the city by Economic Research Associates, its Chicago-based consulting
firm. He also shares ERA's assessment that there's money to be made. But he says he's not nearly far enough along to start lining up an investor group or bank financing. It's known, however, that he got two of Knoxville's leading
money men, Jim Clayton and the retired chairman of First American Bank, Jim
Smith, to accompany him on a trip to Copenhagen last August.
<P> Skeptics minimize the likelihood of any Tivoli-like development here. For one, they don't believe that any of Knoxville's deeper pockets fit the profile of investors in or lenders to such a costly, risky undertaking. Moreover, they stress that any new attractions that start drawing throngs to the World's
Fair Park would require a massive investment from the city for roads and parking. And having just sunk $8 million into its waterfront, the city isn't
showing a disposition to spend more on downtown development. Indeed, its
five-year capital spending plan submitted to City Council on February 13 makes no provision for supporting any BIG Steps, even though the city's
Department of Community Development initiated the planning process.
<P> Fortunately, other projects that will enhance downtown's attractiveness (and the entire community's quality of life) appear to be moving forward without as much dependence on a fickle city government. To wit:
<UL><LI>Counting the $500,000 grant included in Governor Don Sundquist's budget, the Bijou Theatre has raised $1.1 million toward that venerable venue's
$1.5 million goal for renovation.
<LI>The Discovery Center has retained New York architect Donald Skolnick; he designed Chattanooga's $16 million children's museum, which opened last year to accolades. His initial task will be to conduct focus groups to get
consensus on the elements of a new facility to replace the antiquated one at Chilhowee Park. While replicating the $16 million raised in Chattanooga,
mostly from foundations, is probably out of reach, Skolnick should lay the
groundwork for a fund-raising drive to provide something that's been sorely
missing in Knoxville. It would most probably be located near the Knoxville Museum of Art.
<LI>A National Women's Basketball Hall of Fame is being avidly courted by Gloria Ray, president of the Greater Knoxville Sports Corp. According to Ray, a sponsoring organization whose president lives in Texas has been working
for two years on planning and getting $8 million in funding for such a shrine.
She says Knoxville is high on the list of cities being considered as the site and predicts that it could draw 300,000 visitors annually.
</UL><P>An amphitheater, or at least a permanent stage and bandshell is needed
that would provide up to 12,000 seats for summer outdoor concerts in the World's Fair Park. Permanent covered seating for 5,000 would allow Knoxville to match amphitheaters in other cities, such as Starwood outside of Nashville,
that have proven successful on a privately owned and operated basis. But such seating would impinge on turf that the Dogwood Arts Festival has already
staked out for several of its events. So lawn seating may have to suffice. All concerned, including the World's Fair Park's overseer, Paul Sherbakoff, agree that the lawn in question needs to be recontoured. Sherbakoff predicts that funding will be forthcoming for this work, as well as for a stage and
bandshell.
<P> Not to be overlooked is the one new downtown attraction on which work is already under way. It's debatable whether the $8 million that the city is pouring into its waterfront project represents an optimum use of its evidently
scarce resources. But one element of the project that may prove highly appealing
is a Gateway Pavilion that's due to be built on a slope just east of First Creek. City officials are unwilling or as yet unable to specify what sort of exhibits and other features will go into this $3.6 million pavilion--except to say that its theme will be "Where Nature Meets Technology."
<P> Of all the contemplated BIG Steps, the one least likely to get on track any time soon is a rail line for destination-hopping.
<P> "That's not going to become feasible until you've got a convention center and a World's Fair Park destination site to generate enough traffic to support
it," says Laurens Tullock, the city's director of community development.
<H3>Jobs Wanted
</H3><P>The Butcher brothers and Chris Whittle bestowed good-looking buildings
and a sense of vitality on the southern part of downtown that might be called its sun belt. But since the collapse of their errant empires, the outlook for job growth and office occupancy even in the sun belt has turned cloudy. And to the north lies downtown's rust belt, where commercial activity, until one approaches the Old City, ranges from slim to none.
<P> Inability to attract a corporate tenant to the Whittle Building despite a
national search and a fire-sale price epitomizes the difficulties Knoxville faces in increasing its downtown work force. The building's conversion to a federal courthouse will create big vacancies in both the downtown Post Office and the Plaza Tower, where judicial and prosecutorial offices now reside.
<P> Additional vacancies--and actual job losses--are almost sure to follow when
downtown loses the one new corporate headquarters it had managed to attract in recent years: namely, Clayton Homes. When Jim Clayton bought what's now the Bank First Building three years ago to house the bank he also owns, he moved 100 Clayton homes personnel in with him. But he has since concluded that they need to be brought back under the same roof with the 300 other
Claytonites who were left behind on Alcoa Highway. Anticipating further growth as well, he is now looking for a campus-like facility in either West Knoxville or Blount County that will accommodate up to 600 workers. "I would have preferred
to remain downtown," he says, "but I couldn't get the kind of space I needed at a competitive price."
<P> These negatives are don't indicate mass migration out of downtown's 4.6 million
square feet of office space. To the contrary, according to a recent survey by the Metropolitan Planning Commission, downtown's 1995 vacancy rate of 9.5 percent is well below the national average. And its work force, according to Cate, is at least holding its own at just under 20,000. But there hasn't been an increase in downtown office space over the past five years, during which time suburban space has grown by more than 40 percent to a total of 7 million square feet that's 95 percent occupied.
<P> "The downtown office market is stagnant," says Tom Weiss, president of
FMP/Weissco, a commercial real estate company. "If civic-minded people like Jim Clayton and Jim Haslam don't see fit to put their headquarters downtown, how can we expect others to do so?" (Haslam's Pilot Corp. recently moved into a new headquarters building on Lonas Road out west.)
<H3>Playing Monopoly
</H3><P>The BIG Steps committee on downtown as a place to work isn't touting any grand designs for spurring its rapid resurgence as a commercial hub. Perhaps in part because the committee's chairman, Tom Ingram, is a partner in a venture capital firm that invests in fledgling enterprises, its principal
focus has been on nurturing just such firms, which could become large employers
in the future. Creating incubator space for them in a building with low rent and high-tech support services is a committee recommendation. It isn't clear who would provide the subsidies to do so.
<P> Perplexingly, the man who has been manifesting the greatest faith in downtown's
prospects (as measured by multimillion dollar property investments) wasn't even invited to participate in the BIG Steps process. He is Mike Conley, whose Regal Corp. has become a hugely successful distributor of heavy equipment
parts. Over the last few years, he has acquired four of the downtown's landmark
office buildings, along with the prime block of Gay Street real estate where a new federal courthouse was to be built. His much younger brother Brian manages the Conley properties and is known to be on the lookout for still more acquisitions.
<P> "The Conleys appear to be playing monopoly using downtown Knoxville as their
playing board," says Weiss.
<P> The brothers are almost sphinx-like about their game plan. But when it's
suggested that some of their older, semi-vacant properties (such as the former
Charter Federal and Valley Fidelity bank buildings) look like Mediterranean and Baltic, Brian Conley retorts, "We want Boardwalk and Park Place, too,
assuming the price is right."
<P> The Conleys are reliably reported to believe the block that was to house the federal court house will become the site of the city's next big office tower. Sooner or later, it's postulated, a major bank or other financial
institution will want to move into Knoxville with a high profile presence and will provide an anchor tenant for such an edifice. In the meantime, don't be surprised if the first new office building in the downtown area since Whittle starts going up on the Conley-owned Gay Street frontage between two other Conley properties: the First American Bank Center and the former Charter
Federal building. And don't look for any urban planning gurus from afar to be involved in shaping the steps the Conleys take.
<H3>Living Quarters
</H3><P>If the big money is not there for tourist and convention development, the best hope for restoring downtown vitality, especially in its rust belt, is to get more people to live there.
<P> Restoration of a few older buildings has already drawn a hardy breed of upscale
urban dwellers to condominiums and apartments in the Old City and at developments
such as the Pembroke, Kendrick Place and Willingham Garret. According to Ann Marie Tugwell, executive director of the Central Business Improvement
District, there are now 231 privately owned dwelling units within its definition
of downtown, which excludes a public housing high-rise and the historically
residential Maplehurst enclave near the riverfront. While this number has been creeping up, some developers are convinced of the potential for faster
growth.
<P> "There are a lot of people in Knoxville who savor an urban lifestyle and want to be a part of a vibrant downtown scene," says Kristopher Kendrick, who's made restoration of the city's vintage buildings his life's work.
<P> The BIG Steps committee on downtown as a place to live, which Kendrick chairs,
has targeted one of the largest of these buildings as a catalyst. The Sterchi
Building towers above the rest of the old rooftops along Gay Street's 100 block, while that block's proximity to the Old City has already made it the site of several smaller-scale renovations.
<P> Together with architects Buzz Goss and Jennifer Martella, Kendrick proposes to develop plans for converting the Sterchi Building into 50 or more condominium
units. He believes these plans, including all attendant costs and projected
revenues, will demonstrate the feasibility of such an undertaking to the
satisfaction of equity investors and bank lenders who would be needed to finance it. However, Kendrick says he's already got too many other projects under way to get involved in taking a Sterchi BIG Step beyond the planning stage.
<P> A well-credentialed developer who, perhaps unbeknownst to Kendrick, has already
made an intensive analysis of a Sterchi Building residential transformation isn't prepared to go forward with it either.
<P> "I don't believe the demand is there for a project of this scale at this point in time," says Steve Mosadegh, who has just completed a fully sold 13-unit condominium development in the nearby Commerce Building. Mosadegh
believes the 100 block will transform itself--but more gradually, through
renovations on the same or a smaller scale than the one he's just completed. He also foresees a trend away from the $75,000 to $100,000 condos that have been the mainstay of downtown development and toward more affordable rental
units. "That's going against the grain of present residents who want the area to be upscale, but I believe the greatest growth potential is to provide
housing that's within the reach of younger downtown workers."
<P> Achieving a critical mass of residents, all agree, is the key to any augmentation
of downtown's depleted ranks of merchants. Heading a list of stimulants to
residential growth noted at a meeting of the committee Kendrick chairs is "Need a grocery store." But Kendrick is clear that "the people have to come
first, and the goods and services will follow."
<P> Meanwhile, the CBID is devoting a large part of the $330,000 it collects annually from downtown property owners to sprucing up target areas. The 100 block of Gay Street just got a $150,000 grant for everything from face-lifting
shabby facades to installing awnings, banners and planters. All of the property
owners on the block have banded together to contribute an additional $50,000 of their own to the cosmetic common cause.
<P> At the same time, on downtown's southern flank, construction work is starting on the first 16 of 80 prospective condominium units that represent the
residential component of Volunteer Landing Associates' ambitious $32 million
waterfront development project. It remains to be seen how much demand there will be for these units, which are priced at $160,000 or higher.
<P> Instead of looking to committees or consultants to conjure up grandiose master
plans, downtown's best hope for progress may well rest with enterprising
developers like the Testermans and Mosadegh taking small steps on their own. But the one local design consultant involved in the BIG Steps process, Charlie
Smith of Bullock Smith and Partners, defends it as a way to balance and
prioritize competing claims on limited community resources.
<P> "There are a lot of gooey ideas out there, and we're going to get stuck unless we look at them as parts of a big picture," Smith warns.

<P><STRONG>With more people than ever seeking out jazz here, Knoxville has all the makings for a true scene.</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Jack Neely</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>It's a Friday evening, about 7:30, at the Knoxville Museum of Art. An
internationally famous jazz pianist is playing keyboards alongside a veteran
bebop saxman as about 300 paying customers of all ages and races stand or sit listening at tables, watching, talking quietly, drinking beer. This happens
every Friday night.
<P> The band quits at 8, and the audience files out. An hour later, a whole new
audience arrives to see a whole different piano-jazz show of singing and dancing, based on the work of Fats Waller. It's packed, too.
<P> Knoxville, as we know, is the cradle of country music, a bassinet of the blues, and one of the playpens of rock 'n' roll.
<P> Today, though, Knoxville's becoming better known abroad for jazz.
<P> A trumpeter and record collector who lives west of Nashville regularly makes the 200-mile trip to Knoxville three times a month just to hear the live jazz. Another jazz enthusiast who works in Atlanta maintains an apartment in Knoxville just because he's here to see live music every weekend he can fly up. Hundreds have moved here to study jazz in the past decade or so, and many have stayed. Jazz fans who travel report that Knoxville's public-radio
jazz programs are light years ahead of what's available anywhere else in the Southeast.
<P> Donald Brown, a Memphis-born pianist whose jazz recordings are known worldwide,
asserts that Knoxville's jazz scene is more lively than that in his more
musically famous home town. Others echo that sentiment. Never mind cities of comparable size: When jazz fans talk about what's available in Knoxville, they compare us to metropolises. And they always insist that Knoxville's got more and better jazz than Atlanta, Nashville, Memphis, or Washington, D.C.
<P> If you haven't heard Knoxville and jazz floating on the same breath, maybe you don't get out enough. The KMA's Alive After Five is just the unlikeliest
manifestation of this spirit. Several local nightclubs sometimes feature live jazz. Lucille's hosts it six nights a week. Even with a nominal cover
charge, Lucille's typically packs the place, with standing room only well past midnight, even on many weeknights.
<P> More than one observer calls this dynamic jazz phenomenon "Knoxville's best-kept
secret." But the secret's already seeping out; sometimes it's better known in other corners of the planet than here in the upper Tennessee Valley. Maybe
it's time to rat on all the jazz talent in Knoxville, and on the patrons, too diverse to be called a subculture, who support it. And to speculate about how we got such an unfair share of good jazz.
<H3>Modern Jazz
</H3><P>In the mid-'70s, public radio station WUOT, which had broadcast jazz
occasionally since the late '40s, got a galvanic charge from a couple of new DJ's, Ashley Capps and Mike Dotson, maniacal young jazzhounds who approached
the music with infectious curiosity. Dotson is proud of his work at WUOT, but skeptical about how many people the late-night shows reached. They weren't
aware of an audience for radio jazz in Knoxville until the early '80s, when WUOT began scheduling jazz earlier in the evening. By then, something else was happening, too.
<P> In 1975, UT, which had no jazz curriculum, hired a new saxophone teacher, only dimly aware that he was a jazz authority nationally respected since the early '60s. A veteran of Woody Herman's band originally from South Bend,
Jerry Coker says that accepting the UT job was "the only selfish decision I've ever made in my life." He owned land in the mountains nearby and had a utopian dream of opening a back-to-nature jazz academy there.
<P> To Coker, Knoxville seemed like a musically slow "sleepyhead town." He intended
to keep a low profile at UT, to be "the quiet professor in a dusty corner" who pursued his own interests on his own time. He built a three-story log
building near Viking Mountain, N.C., perhaps the first jazz cabin in history. It was finished around 1980, and Coker conducted some summer workshops up there, but logistics damned it. "It was enormously successful in drawing
students," he says, "but it was too hard getting groceries" from the nearest
store, half an hour away.
<P> Meanwhile, UT offered opportunities with convenient groceries. Embarrassed when colleagues at other universities noticed Coker's name in UT's catalogue and said, "You must have a great jazz program," music department chairman Bill Starr talked Coker into starting one. It was an immediate success. Along
with Coker and saxophonist Bill Scarlett, the department enlisted bassist Rusty Holloway, like Coker a nationally respected author on jazz technique.
<P> Coker thinks people too often associate jazz with urbanity. "The person starting
out may yearn to go to a big city, because they've heard in the song, 'If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere,'" says Coker (who incidentally has accompanied Frank Sinatra). "I've got a lot of bones to pick with that. One is that a surprisingly small number of jazz musicians come from large metro areas. They come from Dubuque, Iowa; Manhattan, Kansas. Cities don't breed great jazz, though maybe there's more work there." This nationwide jazz authority commutes to Knoxville from distinctly un-urban Dandridge.
<P> By the late '70s, a Kingston Pike club called Chantilly's featured a local jazz combo regularly. Among the principals was a TVA employee named Rocky Wynder who'd already been playing sax in the Knoxville area for the better part of 30 years. One of only a few local jazz musicians who weren't lured here by UT's music department, the Sarasota native arrived accidentally--he was stranded here in 1949 by a big band whose name he prefers not to recall.
<P> For years he made a living playing R&amp;B for frat parties, but bebop was his love. On tour, he'd met Charlie Parker and several other great saxophonists
of the day. Wynder is now the new executive director of the Jazz Exchange
Organization, which demonstrates jazz in local high schools and coordinates
special events.
<P> Opinions about when (or whether) Knoxville experienced a sudden interest in jazz vary with the witness. To Scarlett, who remembers when Gordon's Townhouse
was packing them in by the hundreds in the late '50s, it's been more or less a continuum, with ups and downs along the way. Some, like Wynder, remember
Chantilly's as the beginning of the current interest in jazz.
<P> But many remember one place and time when live jazz went ballistic. In late 1982, as the World's Fair closed, students and others ambling Cumberland Avenue sidewalks were astonished to hear something different flowing from the open door of the Best Italian Restaurant. Only remotely related to the
restaurant of the same name now opening a few blocks down the street, the
original Best Italian was a dark, intimate bar with original art on the walls,
cheap beer, no cover--and live jazz. The house band often included members of UT's new jazz faculty, including Holloway, plus Wynder.
<P> It was mostly just old bebop, but it was performed in such an inspired way that people packed in to hear it. UT students, beached World's Fair carnies,
punked-out teenagers, young marrieds: people who'd never seen live jazz in their lives made all-night habits of the place. By early '83, the ostensive pasta restaurant was seeing standing-room-only crowds who sometimes clustered on the sidewalk outside. Jerry Coker, whose brother Jack sometimes played piano there, recalls that it was often so jammed that "the din would sometimes
drive us out of there."
<P> One regular was Annie Delisle, a former dancer from England (and ex-wife of novelist Cormac McCarthy) who daydreamed of opening her own jazz club. In the slum district nobody was yet calling the Old City, Annie carved out an upscale continental restaurant--and entertained her daring customers with live jazz.
<P> A fire destroyed the Best in early '84. The jazz soon moved downtown, briefly to a lounge called Piccolo's and to a short-lived Market Square spot called the Milestone, opened by soft-jazz band leader Lee Miles Stone. But it was at Annie's that jazz thrived, even when there was nothing else open down there so late.
<P> After Delisle left in 1990, of course, her place became known as Lucille's. Jazz survived and grew. Today, Lucille's hosts live jazz six nights a week, and may be better known for its jazz than for its impressive menu.
<P> As Annie's grew, the eclectic nightclub Ella Guru's opened across the street,
bringing an astonishing mix of country, rock and jazz. Few nights at Ella's were more memorable than when Sun Ra's Arkestra played. One of the most bizarre
bands that's ever visited here, and one of the most entertaining, it may also have been one of the most musically significant. Mike Dotson says Sun Ra's big band successfully bridged the mainstream and the avant garde, making
interesting music that was also entertaining. "He was a great innovator,
influential and groundbreaking. He extended Ellington's orchestral work--even as Ellington was just doing his greatest hits over and over."
<P> Sun Ra was also one of the most visible jazz artists in Knoxville for several
years. Promoter Ashley Capps says that through a dozen appearances, some for two or three nights at a stretch, Sun Ra played Knoxville more than any other non-local act. Some say that before his 1993 death Ra was contemplating
moving here; Capps says Ra seemed to feel some mystical connection to Knoxville,
that he specifically believed he was descended from William Blount.
<P> Capps recalls his astonishment, rounding a corner near his Gay Street office a few years ago, to see men wearing space suits on Blount Mansion's lawn. It was the filming of a Sun Ra video which Capps regrets he hasn't seen. (If anybody has a copy, we'd like to see it, too.)
<P> Though Ra didn't move here, a prominent percussionist from his band, the
nonpareil Samari Celestial, did, often playing for local audiences. 
<H3>Donald Leaps In
</H3><P>This was the scene Donald Brown discovered when he decided to move from Boston to Knoxville. A pianist in the band of the legendary drummer Art Blakey (which had recorded some Brown compositions in its last years), Brown had passed through Knoxville in the early '80s. "Just looking at the place, I thought this was like redneck city. I didn't think I'd want to live
here." When Jerry Coker called, he was making his way as a pianist with two
albums to his credit, but was frustrated with his teaching post at Boston's
Berkeley Conservatory and considering moving home to Memphis. After a longer
visit eight years ago, he took the UT job.
<P> "When I first moved here, I thought, Wow, Knoxville's getting much more jazz
through than Memphis is. Every month or so I'd look up and there'd be somebody I knew. I thought, I don't even have to leave the city, I can still see some of the cats."
<P> That's not quite as true since the closing of Ella Guru's in 1990, but Brown is still impressed with the traffic by way of other venues, like the Bijou's jazz series. And he loves Lucille's.
<P> "At Lucille's you can play anything you want, experiment," he says. "The people who come there are open-minded. It's small, but some world-famous jazz clubs are just that size, maybe a little larger. Even the Village Vanguard
can't be much bigger than Lucille's." Distracted audiences annoy some performers,
but Brown thrives on them. "Those are my favorite places," he says, "where you can hear the glasses tinkling and the cash register ringing."
<P> "I feel fortunate and blessed that they had some great musicians here," he says, mentioning Wynder, Scarlett, guitarist Mark Boling, Keith Brown. "Getting
to play with musicians like that, when I do get to play with musicians in New York or Paris, I feel I haven't lost anything." He says his Knoxville years have been the most productive of his life.
<P> Knoxvillians with only a passing acquaintance with jazz were startled a couple
years ago to hear the pianist who'd played for free at local restaurants, taking requests from boozy patrons, featured for the full hour of the nationally
popular public-radio show "Piano Jazz." Those who bought his records and read the trade publications weren't so surprised. National jazz critics had been calling Brown one of America's brightest talents for years.
<P> Many observers credit Brown with the lion's share of Knoxville's recent mania for jazz. "I feel people are very supportive of my work, and jazz," Brown says. "It's a thrill to see it grow."
<P> In his travels to world jazz events, Jerry Coker says Knoxville is known as far away as Monaco as the city where Donald Brown lives. "It's hard to
determine when you live here," Coker says. "But he's very hot right now."
<P> Brown became the crown jewel of UT's burgeoning jazz program, which Coker
honestly insists is the best in the nation. He's partial, of course. But few UT faculty members are bold enough to make comparable claims about their own departments; few have reason to. 
<H3>The Knoxville Mystique
</H3><P>"Once you start a jazz program, the students themselves become the
salesmen," says Coker. "They need the money, and need the experience" of playing before live audiences in clubs. "It's a natural thing for an audience to respond." Coker thinks there's always been a large jazz audience here, but it's never been "polarized" by jazz venues.
<P> Longtime observer Mike Dotson concurs. "You know what happens in Knoxville," he says. "People come here to go to school. They get out of UT, they're
comfortable, they stay around. They go back to school, learn social work, teach Tai Chi, teach saxophone. They go into the magical culture of Knoxville
that makes this such an interesting place." Most of Dotson's computer-consulting
business is in Atlanta--but he makes it back to Knoxville every weekend he can stand to.
<P> Dotson sees a demographic trend at work here. People born in the '40s and
'50s--the Baby Boomers, essentially--are more accustomed to stepping out in the evening than previous generations were. As they slip through their 30s and 40s, Dotson thinks, they may lose the rock 'n' roll habit, but not
necessarily the nightclubbing habit.
<P> "People who are older may be getting tired of rowdy music," Dotson says. "Also, people associate jazz with sophistication. Knoxville's adult population
tends to feel more urban--and more cosmopolitan--than its adult population of 20 or 30 years ago."
<P> He calls Annie's/Lucille's "a figurehead, a catalyst" of Knoxville's awakening
interest in jazz. Donald Brown, Wendell Werner, Bill Scarlett, and many other
local stars are regulars. Werner, who has recently done the booking at Lucille's,
is known for his perfectionism. But he knows over 35 musicians in Knoxville alone who are good enough to play Lucille's. "If I wanted to, I could book the rest of the year using Knoxville talent alone."
<P> Lucille's reputation may be crossing regional borders. Werner says he was
attending a Nashville performance of Les Miserables, talking to a drummer with the musical's traveling company. "As soon as he heard I played at Lucille's
in Knoxville, he was suddenly impressed with me," Werner says.
<P> Saxophonist David King calls Lucille's "The Promised Land. I like the bar, the people, the waitresses," says King, who at 28 is one of the younger
performers on the scene. "People pay $20 to hear Donald Brown in New York," he says. "We pay $2 at Lucille's." He's ambivalent about his observation that "young hipsters are thinking it's cool to listen to jazz," but is sure
trendiness can't be all bad.
<P> King and his colleagues at the Disc Exchange say jazz sales are strong,
especially bebop--and some progressive jazz records available only by mail order a few years ago now have their own section there.
<H3>Thriving After Five
</H3><P>One Lucille's regular is artist and singer Cynthia Markert, who hosts
open-mike nights on Tuesdays. Her portraits of women, with striking faces in exotic clothes in dim light, have an unreality to them. But it's easy to conclude that she might be drawing some of this candle-lit species from life at Lucille's. They turn out even on a cover-charge weeknight; by midnight
Tuesday there may be 50 customers in the small room, listening to piano jazz and torch songs. There's a lot of touching, cheek-kissing. If mainstream
Knoxville might call them pretentious, it's not their concern.
<P> Lucille's caters to a younger clientele, mostly under 45, mostly single. Though most of the performers who play regularly there have played at KMA too, Lucille's customers don't necessarily show up at the KMA shows; some make fun of them.
<P> The Annie's/Lucille's phenomenon evolved slowly. The KMA's Alive After Five--and
especially its subsequent success--took everybody by surprise. Conceived as a short-term promotional gimmick by KMA CEO Richard Ferrin in the summer of '93, under the guidance of personable WUOT disk jockey and jazz expert
Marshall Stevens, Alive After Five caught fire and began generating heat of its own.
<P> Some credit Stevens's personality through both Alive After Five and his evening
jazz show for inspiring mainstream Knoxville's jazz jones. But after summer 1994, when WUOT suddenly fired Stevens, the jazz show he'd kindled blazed just as brightly. (The current MC is the unsubtle former dino-rock jock Colvin
Idol.) Stevens moved away, but was recently spotted at an Alive After Five show.
<P> Audiences are currently averaging 350 each Friday night, 40 Fridays a year.
Sometimes that figure approaches 600, coming and going. Some shows have sold out; hopeful spectators had to wait in the lobby for others to leave. The KMA estimates that some two-thirds of a given audience is made up of KMA members, who get in free; but they also admit that quite a few KMA members pay their dues mainly because they want to get in free to Alive After Five.
<P> It's important to appreciate just how weird that idea is. First, amplified music and plentiful alcoholic drinks in a controlled-environment museum of fine arts: you don't see that everywhere. But make that music bebop, a late-night
genre if there ever was one, and play "Round Midnight" in broad daylight starting at about 5:30, before most of us have started thinking about supper, and you've got a true cultural freak on your hands. But it works.
<P> There and almost nowhere else in town you'll see three or more races sitting
beside each other. And if a Boomer demographic boosts attendance at other jazz shows, it's only barely relevant at AAF. At a recent show there was an old lady in a wheelchair, several toddlers, teenage girls, men in suits and gray whiskers, all enjoying themselves. Some come every single Friday and never get tired of it. Others, like a service veteran I spoke with who's now training to be a veterinarian, save up to come only two or three times a year. 
<H3>Les Etoiles
</H3><P>Currently, a new crowd replaces that one to see the late-night musical
jazz revue, "Ain't Misbehavin,'" whose director, pianist Werner, is another
former Memphian who came to Knoxville to be part of UT's music program. That was 15 years ago. He stayed to perform. One of Knoxville's busiest musicians, he mounts musical revues at the KMA, performs at dozens of local functions and coordinates Lucille's live music lineup. He and his most frequent saxophone
accomplice, Terry Schmidt, have a locally released CD. Werner intends to record a live album of all-original pieces at AAF this summer, potentially for national release.
<P> The KMA gets queries about its unlikely success from other, bigger art museums
around the country. The groundbreaking program caught the attention of the
American Association of Museums, which is recommending the strategy in other
cities.
<P> Several musicians featured at Alive After Five have gone on to other forums. The Knoxville jazz recording event of 1995 was the release of Nancy Brennan
Strange's album, Les Etoiles Mysterieuse.
<P> Strange's background is in folk music and storytelling. A video she made a couple years ago got some rotation on national country TV. Her latest recording
was produced by mandolinist/bluegrass rhino Don Cassell, who has often shared a country/folk stage with Strange. But this album is undeniably a jazz album,
albeit soft jazz, featuring the talents of Brown (who did the arrangements) and Wynder (leading a horn section of seven saxophonists), as well as jazz
guitarist Mark Boling and others.
<P> It's the sort of collaboration between country and jazz professionals that would seem unlikely outside of Knox County. But to Strange, it seems natural.
"Old-timey string-band music is a real improvisational kind of music," Strange
says. "You do a break, and improvise. That's what jazz is, improvisation."
<H3>Minor Chords
</H3><P>Not everything is looking up for jazz here, however. Conventional
auditorium events at the Bijou and elsewhere sometimes see disappointing ticket sales. The future of the Jazz in the Park series is in question after some sparse turnouts at the free event in recent years. Several local bars,
restaurants and coffee shops have experimented with jazz recently only to curtail it, allegedly because jazz audiences don't drink as much as rock 'n' roll audiences.
<P> Several performers admire Ivory's, an upscale piano bar in a Bearden basement, as a perfect space for jazz, but audiences there can be oblivious. Greg Negbauer,
a New York pianist-songwriter known for his subtly humorous lyrics, gets
extravagant press from Chicago to Austin. But he was frustrated with his recent Ivory's show. Conversation was so loud that his lyrics were inaudible.
<P> Pianist Werner, though he typically plays to a packed house, says Knoxville's
audiences still don't reflect the level of talent here.
<P> "There are a lot of things here that Knoxvillians don't even know about--although
a number of other people around the country know about it. If they were
actors--everybody knows David Keith's here. But if Donald Brown, or Samari, or Bill Scarlett walked into New York City today, they'd get a gig tonight."
<P> And as good as it is, Werner knows that "Lucille's is the only place to hear jazz regularly in Knoxville." He thinks the city would be stronger with more
nightclubs. Almost everybody, in fact, wishes there were still one of the caliber of the universally lamented Ella Guru's, bringing in major jazz acts in an intimate forum.
<P> "I would like to see some jazz club along the vibe of Ella Guru's," says Brown. "That's something my students miss. There's nothing like seeing some of these guys live. Even if they just have jazz once a month, it's something to look forward to. I really miss that. But for a town this size, we're doing
pretty good."
<P> "Knoxville is a good jazz-lovin' town," says Rocky Wynder. "You've just got to have something to put out for them."
<P> "You know, Knoxville is kind of a paradox," concludes saxman Scarlett, originally
from Arkansas by way of LSU. "It can seem like a real redneck area, but there are all these people interested in jazz--comparatively speaking, a lot more than most towns. I don't know exactly what it is. But sometimes it amazes me."
<P> Maybe it's just that old paradox that makes Knoxville a "good jazz-lovin' town." Wynton Marsalis, Donald Brown's former colleague in Art Blakey's band,
loves to talk about jazz. All kinds of music, he says, have their place,
representing one region or one age group or one social status. But only jazz is complex and sophisticated enough to embrace the whole of human experience. Or, he might add next time he's in town, only jazz can embrace the country/
blues/ classical/ rural/ urban/ redneck/ academic experience that's Knoxville.

</H1><P><STRONG>Children's beauty pageants groom little contestants for big
crowns</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Mike Gibson</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>It's Thursday evening at Foothills Mall, and there's something odd happening
in front of Sears. Eight giddy young women line the front of a T-shaped hardwood
stage, flanked by awkward clusters of fold-out tables covered with two-foot
trophies and ornate golden crowns. They're staring out at a gathering of some 80-odd shoppers, and they're all beaming like the Cheshire Cat, smiling so hard that their teeth are dry and their jaws are starting to ache.
<P>The reason for all the painful grimacing is that each woman is holding, in outstretched arms, a cooing and squirming baby girl. Each bubbling babe is impeccably packaged, festooned with frills, swathed in silk and chiffon, and spooned into gleaming white patent leather shoes the size of complimentary
bars of soap. As the mothers stand there, staring and grinning, most of them
nervously bounce their precious bundles up and down in classic tike-on-the-knee
fashion.
<P>The moms' anxiety is understandable. This is the final cattle call for
contestants in the under-one age bracket of a Sunburst Beauty Pageant and Baby Contest preliminary. Like most national beauty pageant systems, Sunburst
offers categories for babies and children as well as teens and young women, and this is the last chance for  contest judges to admire all the cherub smiles and dollhouse dresses on display in the tiny tots division.
<P>For some people, the whole notion of children's beauty pageants--parading kids across a stage and deeming one of them somehow more beautiful or worthy than the others--seems inherently wrong. According to Dr. Melissa Groves,
assistant professor of Child and Family Studies at the University of Tennessee,
children's pageants may introduce skewed value systems (stressing appearance over inner qualities) to impressionable young minds, and force fragile little
psyches to bear potentially crippling competitive pressures.
<P>"I think (children's pageants) foster a sense of competition at ages where,
developmentally, we try to focus on cooperation," says Groves. "For a
four-year-old child, the question becomes 'I didn't win this contest--is mommy still going to love me?'"
<P>On the other hand, the people who sponsor shows contend that the contests
foster poise and self-confidence even in pre-teen competitors, teach youngsters
how to be charitable winners (or graceful losers) and provide young girls with the same competitive opportunities that pee-wee football and little league baseball afford their male counterparts.
<P>And for the winners of big pageants, the payoffs are considerable. The
Sunburst preliminary winners will have a shot at $10,000 savings bonds if they move on to regional finals in Gatlinburg, and most larger pageants award
scholarship money to winners and runners-up.
<P>But none of the parents on stage seem overly concerned with the larger
implications of beauty pageants right now. They're too busy beaming and bouncing
their bewildered tots, pausing periodically in mid-bounce to nuzzle a chubby
cheek or administer a fond cootchie-coo.
<P>When the judges finish their evaluation, babes and parents disperse,
anticipating the awards presentation at the end of the show. Most of the
contestants receive a good mouth-wiping or dress-dabbing as soon as they exit the stage.
<P>"Was she spitting up on stage, too?" one young woman asks a fellow
pageant-mom. She's smiling, but still curious as to how the less-than-decorous
display might affect the final outcome.
<P>"Just a little bit at the end. I think it was all the bouncing."
<H3>WALKING DOWN THE RUNWAY
</H3><P>Baby and kiddie pageants are nearly as old as the adult contests they mimic. Dr. John Kandilakis, a West Knoxville psychologist, remembers entering his eldest son, Steven, in a local baby contest nearly 37 years ago. One-year-old
Steven was a charmer, Kandilakis recalls, and claimed first prize in his first and only dalliance in the world of pageants. 
<P>But the episode also fostered ill will between Kandilakis and a colleague, a fellow psychologist who took umbrage when his infant daughter lost the
first-place plaque to young Steven.
<P>"There's lots of ego investment in your child being the most beautiful in the world," Kandilakis says. "My wife and I were amused that some people took it so seriously. I think some people became very narcissistically invested
in their kids. Others, like ourselves, just viewed it as a lark."
<P>Kandilakis believes children's pageants can help entrants build self-esteem
and increase social skills, provided that judges don't place too high a premium
on physical appearance. But since the impetus for entering tot contestants
inevitably comes from parents, Groves warns that children's needs are usually, at best, a secondary concern.
<P>"Do very young children really say 'I need to be in a beauty contest?'" Groves asks. "I think what you're seeing is adult needs being met, not
children's. The better thing to do would be to wait until they're old enough to make that choice for themselves."
<P>For most of the parents at small local pageants like the Sunburst mall show, the point is probably moot; at Foothills, there are more first-time
entrants than veterans, and most of the rookie parents indicate their child
probably won't enter a second pageant.
<P>"I'd never thought about entering Peyton in a contest until a friend called me up today and suggested it," says Mindy Walker, a Knoxville dental hygienist.
Walker went to Dillard's on her lunch break the day of the Sunburst preliminary,
purchased a $15 royal blue velvet dress at a children's clothing sale, and hauled her nine-month-old daughter out to Maryville just in time for the 6 o'clock show.
<P>When asked if Peyton will compete again, Walker responds with a shy smile and a hesitant shrug. "I really don't know--it just depends."
<P>But for contestants like five-year-old Sabrina Moranto, a veteran of eight
pageants, or Tiffany Spears, a three-year-old Kodak resident showing off her sparkling pale blue eyes at contest number four, shows like the Sunburst
prelims are springboards to deeper contest waters, training grounds for more
prestigious pageants with bigger payoffs.
<P>According to Darleen DeLisle, a former teen contestant herself, pageants come in three sizes; small, locally-produced pageants--so-called "Saturday Night Live Shows," where winners take home little more than a trophy, a sash and satisfaction; large-system pageants, like Sunburst, Universal Southern Charm, or Glamour Dolls, where local and regional shows lead to high-stakes state and national finals; and the "granddaddy" pageants, the Miss America and Miss USA systems, where the rewards are substantial at every level of
competition.
<P>DeLisle is familiar with all aspects of pageantry. She's a former contestant,
the mother of a contestant and the founder of her own pageant system--the
Knoxville-based Teddy Bear Baby Pageants, a national company that caters
exclusively to children five and under.
<P>DeLisle says Teddy Bear entry fees usually run $40 to $50 at local
preliminaries, $135 at state contests and $150 at the national level. Some large national contests, however, charge entrants more than $500 just to toddle across the stage in a ruffled dress.
<P>And though even small-pageant competitors can often find sponsors, the fees serve to underscore a point; for those parents and children who go beyond
entering that first tiny local contest, pageants can be an expensive proposition.
<P>"If you can't afford it, you don't need to get into it," says Freda Scates, a Sevierville native. Besides organizing a host of small pageants across Sevier County, Scates entered her daughter Melissa in contests from the time she was three until she rebelled at age 14.
<P>"Even in the '70s and '80s, I'd spend $200 or $300 per pageant, and that
didn't include modeling classes," Scates says. "If she had been entering national pageants, it would have easily been $500 or more."
<H3>PAGEANT PRIMA DONNAS?
</H3><P>If you poll a handful of experienced pageant parents, most of them will tell you that they enter their child in hopes of instilling the kind of
unflappable confidence you see in big-time pageant winners, those serenely poised twenty-somethings who grab the mike at the end of a televised contest and rattle off self-assured answers to questions about career goals and world
peace.
<P>"Taneesha was so shy as a child--I really didn't know what would happen to her as she got older," DeLisle says of her daughter, now 18. "You'd put her in a room with several other children, and she'd always find her way to the corner and stay by herself."
<P>DeLisle entered Taneesha in a Golden Girl system preliminary at age three (she was fifth runner-up). Fifteen years and 30-odd pageants later, Taneesha
seems a walking advertisement for the value of children's pageants; she's
beautiful, bright (she graduated, with honors, a year early from private schools in Florida and Alaska) and possesses the graceful, unaffected sense of self of a woman 12 years her senior.
<P>"If I go into a room full of people now, I feel very comfortable walking up and saying 'Hey, how're you doing?'" she says. "When you've been on stage a few times, in situations where you really have to think on your feet, you
overcome that self-consciousness."
<P>The flip side, says Scates, is that for some young girls, ballooning
self-confidence can easily turn into swollen-headed self-centeredness. She
remembers that many of the more experienced contestants at her daughter's
pageants would make fun of awkward, less experienced competitors.
<P>"The children who knew what they were doing would sometimes get snotty,
giggling and laughing at the kids who had on the wrong clothes or whatever," she says. "I saw really young children say awful things to the other kids. Most of them grew up to be what I call beauty pageant brats."
<P>Including, she says, Melissa, now 27, whom she characterizes as a "big,
beautiful brat." And although Scates says she's glad Melissa gained poise and fashion sense from her experience, she admits that her daughter's distorted
values have caused problems in her adult years.
<P>"She's always had the attention, and had the best of everything, and she wants it kept up," Scates says. "It's been hard on her relationship with her boyfriend. She always expects beautiful clothes and jewelry--Nieman-Marcus,
not Wal-Mart. I'm just glad she's on her own now and buys her own clothes."
<P>But DeLisle claims the dressing-room dynamic at most pageants has changed
markedly over the last ten years. She says contestants at Taneesha's shows were always friendly and supportive, borrowing dresses and accessories from one another and helping less experienced entrants learn the ropes. And rather
than insisting on new clothes for every show, DeLisle says Taneesha won several
pageants wearing $50 gowns purchased at consignment stores.
<P>That alleged attitudinal shift seems to correspond with attempts by most
pageant systems to institute criteria that stress talent, poise and stage
presence as much as, or sometimes more than, appearance. Even at shows (like
Sunburst) that don't require talent, judges look at contestants' poise and
personality, and all but the youngest children will introduce themselves onstage.
<P>"If you went backstage a few years ago, it would probably have made you ill," DeLisle says. "Nowadays, you can't be just another pretty face."
<H3>SINGLING OUT STAGE MOMS
</H3><P>Most people associated with children's pageants seem to agree that
parents, more often than contestants, are responsible for any less-than-admirable behavior that goes on behind the scenes. Scates calls it the "stage mom"
syndrome, when mothers (and sometimes, but much less often, fathers) live
vicariously through their child's onstage exploits, measuring their own
self-worth in terms of trophies and sashes won, sometimes venting their
frustrations on their children when they come out second best.
<P>"When it comes to babies and children's pageants, it should be more cute than competitive," Scates says. "But the parents can make it ugly. It's like
they're entering their prize horse in a race. You have to realize that sometimes
your horse isn't the fastest."
<P>Everyone with any significant pageant experience seems to have at least one stage-mom horror story. Scates remembers a Sevier County woman who stood up and cursed judges and mothers alike when her child lost to Scates's nephew.
Pam McKay, a Pigeon Forge mother who's been both director and judge at local and regional pageants, recalls an Alabama mom who dragged her six-year-old
daughter offstage by the hair after a miscue and whipped her mercilessly. (McKay says the woman was reported to police and arrested later that afternoon.)
<P>And Cyndee Harr, publisher of Winner's Circle, a Tri-Cities-based pageant
magazine that covers seven states, watched one local child contestant grow into an overweight, underachieving teen after suffering routine spankings at the hands of her mother when she lost or performed poorly at shows.
<P>Harr says stories like these are anomalous, and that many of the moms at her own daughter's shows became close friends, socializing after contests and hosting birthday parties for one another's children.
<P>But in some ways, stage moms are like sudden odors--everyone holds their nose and points a finger, but no one owns up to the stench. Scates, for instance,
acknowledges her daughter's misplaced priorities; she acknowledges buying
prepubescent Melissa $250 dresses and diamond jewelry, and running her through
the hoops and paces of modeling, music and dance classes; she even acknowledges
withdrawing Melissa, in a huff, from one contest because she felt the judges gave special consideration to handicapped contestants.
<P>"I told them it was a beauty pageant, not a pity pageant," she says, bristling
at the 13-year-old memory.
<P>She also says she has no regrets, regardless of how her daughter's values may have been affected by all those years of buying pricey clothing and seeking
trophies at all costs.
<P>"It was like an addiction or a sport," Scates says. "It gets in your blood.
You want to win, and the more competitive you get, the more expensive it gets. But Melissa has flawless makeup and clothes now, and lots of
self-confidence. If I had it to do over again, I would."
<P>Vera Henry, a Louisville (Blount County) grandmother who started entering
four-year-old granddaughter Jordan Elmendorf in pageants to foster
self-confidence as she approached her grade school years, puts her finger on what might be the pulse underlying the entire phenomenon--that even the sagest pageant parents (or grandparents) harbor at least a trace of stage mom, maintain a certain selfish personal investment in every step their child
takes down that spotlighted runway.
<P>"If they succeed, we've succeeded," Henry says. "It's a direct line--it's
human nature. It's like you're the only butterfly in the cocoon, and everyone
wants their butterfly to be the most beautiful."
<H3>FROM TYKES TO TEENS
</H3><P>It's not easy to gauge the effects of pageant-going on young children.
More often than not, tots don't know why they're prancing across the stage or waving at the friendly ladies with the pencils behind their ears. And most pageants blur the lines between winners and losers by handing out prizes to every contestant.
<P>"She's been in over 30 shows since she was two weeks old, and she's still
pretty much oblivious," Cyndee Harr says of her three-year-old daughter, Lauren Ashley. "All the pageants give everyone a toy or something, so it's more like 'Do I get a whistle, or a doll?' than 'Did I win or lose?'"
<P>But somewhere between ages 5 and 10, the stakes get higher, the dresses get more expensive, and young girls begin to understand that teddy bears and participation trophies don't mean quite as much as sashes and savings bonds.
<P>"Right around 10 or so, that's where things start getting really competitive,"
DeLisle says. "That's where you start running into big pageants with $500 fees, or contestants who go out and buy $2,000 dresses."
<P>It's also the point where many long-time child competitors burn out, exhausted
by years of modeling classes, music lessons and dressing for success, weary from too many weekends spent cooped up in gymnasiums and convention centers. Pam McKay says at least half of all child competitors will drop out before they hit their teens.
<P>The girls who continue will probably add diet and exercise regimens to an already expansive list of contest-related classes and activities. McKay holds classes for local competitors at Glamour Showcase, a prom and pageant
specialty store she runs in Pigeon Forge, and all of her teenage pupils sport
extracurricular resumes too long to scribble on a winner's sash--National Honor Society, Knoxville Performing Arts, youth choir, Beta Club, Who's
Who&nbsp;...
<P>And since many of the more prestigious pageants factor grades into 
preliminary scores, most serious contestants maintain well-above-average GPAs.
<P>"You can't get up on stage and say 'Well, I get C's and D's,'" DeLisle says. "That doesn't go over very well with judges."
<P>Pageant-going doesn't seem to rid contestants of all the cumbersome
insecurities that often accompany adolescence. Twelve-year-old Tiffany Nash of Pigeon Forge, for instance, says she still considers herself "ugly", even
after winning a Miss USA Northeast Junior pageant late last year.
<P>But Nash and most of her teen peers say that years of performing, speaking, or even just walking around on stage, sometimes for crowds in excess of 1,000
people, heightens social adeptness. 
<P>"I've had people come up to me and say, 'You looked so confident when you walked in,'" says Newport resident Adrienne Parker, the 17-year-old winner of Miss East Tennessee Teen USA. "It always takes me by surprise when they say that, because it's not necessarily the way I feel."
<H3>WINNING THE CROWN
</H3><P>It's 8 p.m. at Foothills Mall, and an impeccably-dressed emcee is doling out awards in the Sunburst pageant preliminary, distributing certificates and trophies until every contestant in every division has something to play with, drop, or slobber on. Most of the younger participants nap through the
ceremony, underwhelmed by the spectacle.
<P>The tiaras, reserved for first-place winners, are about four times bigger than the noggins they're supposed to top. As the diminutive queens are carried
limp and snoring off stage, enormous crowns dangling from tiny necks, some of the also-rans drown their sorrows in the bottle (one with a nipple and plenty of formula) or seek refuge in the purple solace of a Barney doll.
<P>Among older children, the facade of dignified behavior, erect throughout the contest, crumbles. Toddlers squall and wiggle, while many of the school-age
children are screaming like so many pint-sized banshees through the aisles of nearby stores.
<P>One misguided mother, however, casts a pall on the noisy but otherwise
amicable proceedings, marching up to the judges' table dragging her five-year-old
daughter behind her. For a few seconds, she bristles at the stunned judges, then turns tail and storms out through Sears, her would-be princess in tow.
<P>Blount County resident Clara Moranto, mother of division winner Sabrina,
watches from a distance and shakes her head. Sabrina, a curly-headed little
brunette with saucer-sized brown eyes, is frolicking inside a dollar store,
pulling knickknacks off shelves with help from a timid little man with wispy
blond hair and a green suit, a first-timer who lost the boys' three-year-old
division to the only other entrant.
<P>"That's a shame," says Moranto, pity and disgust mingling in her voice as she watches the angry parent disappear in a maze of dress racks and
mannequins. "You shouldn't enter if you're going to take it that seriously. She's got to learn to lighten up and have fun with it."
<P>Sabrina, in the meantime, moves in closer to her newfound playmate, grabs
another toy off the plundered shelves and plops down on the store's grimy tile floor, right on the seat of her lacy maroon crushed-velvet dress.

</H1><P><STRONG>A Challenge from Conservatives Tugs Senator Ben Atchley Farther
Right</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Betty Bean</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>The caller is livid. He's so mad he says he's going to come all the way
from California to find Ben Atchley an opponent for the Sixth Senatorial
District's Tennessee State Senate seat. A liberal opponent. Maybe a black
liberal.
<P>He's pitching a running fit.
<P>When he's done, Atchley's administrative assistant, Tootie Haskins, thanks
him politely, hangs up the telephone, logs the call. They are running about
eight to one in favor of the Senator's Ten Commandments resolution, but the
callers who are opposed are real, real, real pissed (not the word she would
use).
<P>"They all use the word appalled," the unflappable Haskins says, her smile
sweet, her hair a gleaming golden helmet. "They have really blistered my
ears. One woman who said that said she was agnostic. I wanted to say 'I'm
appalled' right back at her."
<P>The phone rings again. "Senator Atchley's office." After a few seconds
she smiles again.
<P>"Is this in regard to the Ten Commandments?"
<P>This one goes into the other column. "May I ask where you're calling from?
Sumner County, well, thank you. Thank you so much, Mr. Martin."
<P>The next caller is a Nashville radio talk show host who wants to know
about the Ten Commandments law. Haskins corrects the radio guy instantly.
<P>"It is not a law, Mr. Hennessey. It is merely a resolution  to encourage.
No law, no mandate. Nobody is forced to do anything."
<P>While she is wrestling the telephone, her senator is giving an interview
to a reporter from the Newark Star-Ledger. The reporter wants to talk about
Lamar Alexander, who relied (read: leaned) on Atchley to support tilting
the 1996 state Republican primary to give the plaid guy a home field advantage.
(Atchley complied, and drew considerable fire and maybe even a primary opponent
for his trouble.)
<P>Atchley emerges from his office briefly to usher an admiring  Vanderbilt
divinity student back to the inner sanctum, and Haskins seizes the opportunity
to tell him that Hennessey wants him to go on a live WLAC talk show the following
Thursday.
<P>Atchley says he'll not be able to do it because he's due on the Senate
floor then. Haskins reminds him of his luncheon speaking engagement, and
that he has been asked to present a framed copy of the Ten Commandments to
Dan Quayle the following week at the governor's prayer breakfast.
<P>He grins and steps back into his office. The door closes behind him.
<P> 
<P>If there is a storm swirling around Ben Atchley today, the 66-year-old
South Knoxvillian is tacking serenely through its eye. He is pro-business,
pro-growth and a champion of ethics legislation. Deeply conservative, he
opposes abortion and supports education, including home schooling. He is
a limelight-shunning consensus-builder, a workhorse in an barn full of show
ponies.
<P>No silver spoon kind of guy, Atchley started working at nine and dropped
out of school to work when he was in the ninth grade. After a while he returned
to Young High to take a double load, graduated and, in 1951, married his
high school sweetheart, Sue King, with whom he performed in an "oldies" band.
(He and Sue sang; she played the piano).
<P>He went to work at the telephone company, moving up through the ranks,
and was elected to the General Assembly in 1972. In 1990 there was a
draft-Atchley movement that ultimately failed to persuade him to run for
governor against incumbent Ned McWherter, although "Gentle Ben" campaign
buttons marked Republican lapels all over East Tennessee that fall.
<P>Year in and year out, he has two standing weekly "dates," one on Friday
night with Sue, another at 5 a.m. Saturday with his 89-year-old father, Curtis,
whom he joins for breakfast at Hardy's on Chapman Highway. Once upon a time,
a columnist compared him to It's a Wonderful Life  hero George Bailey, the
nicest guy in Bedford Falls.
<P>A prominent lobbyist who asks not to be identified says he's flummoxed
by Atchley's sponsorship of the Ten Commandments resolution. It's just not
like him, the lobbyist says, and he suspects it has something to do with
Atchley's as yet unannounced opponent, who is said to enjoy the support of
the religious right.
<P>"He's overreacting," the lobbyist says. "I guarantee, in the past Ben
Atchley would never have done something like this."
<P>He believes the 1994 defeat of Chattanooga Sen. Ray Albright by a Christian
Coalition-supported candidate may have prompted Atchley to do something
uncharacteristically flashy.
<P>The last time Atchley did anything that attracted much controversy was
10 years ago, when he formed an alliance with Senate Speaker John Wilder
(D-Somerville) and quietly engineered a bloodless coup which allowed Republicans
to all but take over the Democrat-controlled Senate.
<P>"The Democrats had a split in their caucus over the right-to-work law,"
Atchley remembers. "And prior to that, Wilder had gotten into trouble for
appointing two Republicans to committee chairmanships because he believed
the leadership should reflect the makeup of the Senate. There were 10 Republicans
at that time."
<P>Hard-line Democrats tried to force Wilder to renounce his bipartisan ways,
and the caucus split when only eight Democrats stuck with him. Atchley saw
an opening and made the approach.
<P>"There were always rumors that we'd had secret meetings and cut deals.
That's not true," he says. "I simply told him, 'Don't forget. You've got
10 people supportive of you on the other side of the aisle.
<P>"I was never asked for anything, and I never offered anything. But I could
count. It was simple arithmetic."
<P>Wilder took him up on it, and the eight dissident Democrats teamed up
with the 10 mostly East Tennessee Republicans, forming a uniquely bipartisan
majority that has allowed Republicans four of nine committee chairmanships
and co-leadership of the 33-member Senate ever since.  
<P>"I am an equal leader of the Senate. He (Wilder) doesn't make a decision
if he doesn't check with me. The Senate is not a partisan body, and we make
decisions on the merits of an issue," Atchley says. 
<P> 
<P>As the Senate Republican leader since 1986, Atchley enjoyed uncommon power
as head of the minority party, thanks to the alliance with conservative
Democrats. Atchley's clout enlarged last September when two Democrats changed
parties to give the GOP a thin majority, its first since Reconstruction.
Since he became majority leader, his continued loyalty to Wilder has cost
him support among GOP hard-liners, but many others believe Atchley is smart
to stick with the "Wilder Bunch," since his majority may not hold past the
November elections.
<P>Atchley dismisses the criticism of those who wanted him to promise to
give Wilder the boot when the Senate reorganizes in 1997, saying he'd be
an ingrate to turn on his longtime ally just because the numbers have changed.

<P>"I try to live by principles," he says. "Ten years ago, John Wilder invited
us to the table, and now just because we have one more Republican than he
has Democrats, they want me to kick him away. That is something I will not
do."
<P>There are 17 Republican state senators in the 33-member body now. Atchley
raised campaign funds for many of them.
<P>"We grew from 10 Republicans to 17, and we didn't do that by kicking people's
shins," Atchley says.
<P>And as for Wilder?
<P>"If I'm back and he's back, he's my candidate."
<P> 
<P>Five days after Atchley brought the Ten Commandments up to the Hill, he'd
talked to CNN, the BBC, ABC and CBS. He had stirred enough controversy to
land him on the Today Show, where he appeared via satellite from the Channel
10 studio. The audio didn't work and he had to use a dorky cordless phone
for his joint interview with smooth-talking civil libertarian Steve Cohen,
who was in Memphis. Cohen, known as one of the Senate's most skillful debaters,
had audio that worked.
<P>The interview was brief. Host Bryant Gumbel began by questioning Atchley
in his usual aggressive fashion, but turned suddenly friendly when Atchley
explained that it was a resolution encouraging  observance of the Ten
 Commandments, not a law that can compel  anyone to do anything.
<P>"Oh," said Gumbel. "Not a law? So what's the big deal?"
<P>That's Atchley's view as well. He attempted to pass the resolution on
the consent calendar, where inconsequential measures like naming bridges
for somebody's mother's housekeeper are generally passed en masse and without
conversation. Cohen spotted it there and bumped it onto the regular calendar.
<P>Although taken aback by the furor, Atchley is not bothered by criticism
of the resolution "to encourage the observance of the Ten Commandments."
The "whereas" portion speaks of "moral decline" which "constitutes a threat
to the welfare of any state" and cites the reverence in which the founders
of the nation held the Ten Commandments. The resolution calls for a return
to those "basic standards," and "encourages" Tennesseans to observe the
commandments and to post them "in their homes, businesses, schools and places
of worship, and that 10 days, starting the fifth day of May ... be set aside
particularly to honor these Commandments."
<P>He says he agreed to sponsor the resolution when Rep. James Peach (R-Camden),
who last year authored a similar measure in the House, asked for his help
in passing it in the Senate this year.
<P>Atchley says he could see the need for the resolution because of the things
he sees as he sits on the Committee on Corrections and Oversight and the
Education Committee, where, he says, "all we're doing is treating symptoms."
<P>"We make rules and we punish. I believe we need to go back to the foundation,
the basic code our laws come from."
<P>While the commandments may be the most visible thing Atchley has done
this year, he wouldn't likely have tagged it as the most important item on
his agenda if you'd asked him at the beginning of the session. 
<P>He is prime sponsor of Gov. Don Sundquist's "Families First" welfare reform
plan; property tax relief for the elderly; all Tennessee Consolidated Retirement
System pension and insurance bills; a controversial bill requiring hospitals
to list community service on annual reports, including education and unsubsidized
health care; and a bill authorizing the Public Building Authority to appoint
an executive committee and hire an administrator.
<P>There's a Victor Ashe-requested bill increasing the number of commissioners
on the Tourist Commission and a bill to require title pledge lenders (storefront
loan institutions that lend small amounts of money on the borrower's car
title) to disclose charges and interest rates on the front end. The idea
for this bill came from a woman whose son had repaid $3,109 on a $1,000 loan.
<P>There are appropriations, too. This year, Knoxville is getting more than
$23 million for such projects as improvements to the Bijou Theater, Ijams
Park and the Knoxville Zoo, and renovations to the Claxton Education Building
at UT. Atchley says having three members of the Knox County delegation on
the Conference Committee, where bills go to be resolved between the House
and the Senate, helps to look out for the local folks.
<P> 
<P>Ray Albright, a Chattanooga Republican, served 26 years in the General
Assembly--two in the House, 24 in the Senate, where he was chairman of the
Education Committee. It was Albright who shepherded the Basic Education Program
of the early '90s, and he was the acknowledged leader of the reforms that
got the state out of the "small schools" federal court lawsuit over inequity
in school funding.
<P>He was defeated in the 1994 Republican primary by David Fowler, a lawyer
from Signal Mountain who made his fundamentalist religious views a prominent
plank in his platform. One prominent Fowler backer was John Davies, president
of the Tennessee Conservative Union. Davies also supports Atchley's prospective
opponent, John Emison.
<P>"Ben Atchley is a good, solid, honest legislator. Yet you've got groups
trying to intimidate him, groups who want to impose their views ... They're
kind of frightening," Albright says.
<P>He feels "an atmosphere of intimidation here (in the General Assembly).
I'm seeing people do things I know they don't believe in out of a fear that
these people will single them out."
<P>"These people" are members of the religious right, which uses churches
to campaign, he says.
<P>"It goes through the churches like wildfire ... I thought I was pretty
conservative. But I will not go along with everything just because it's in
the name of religion, and I'd rather be an ex-senator than be in the atmosphere
we have here now."
<P>(This year the Religious Right is pushing a slate of legislation including
a ban on same-sex marriages, repeal of no-fault divorce laws and prohibition
of the teaching of evolution. Fowler was pictured in the New York Times last
Sunday defending an amendment designed to allow creationism to be taught
in science classes. Later this year, an attempt to exercise control over
textbooks is expected.) 
<P>Albright, a longtime Chattanooga banker, says the opposition ran a whisper
campaign accusing him of most every sin in the book. "They came at me like
a freight train. They campaigned in Sunday school classes. He (Fowler) said
to me, 'I never heard you testify that Jesus Christ is your savior in public.'
Honest to God, he said that to me.
<P>"I still run into the hostility."
<P>Atchley, long a pillar of Greystone Presbyterian Church, has served the
interests of social conservatives for years and can count on important support
from some in those quarters. 
<P>Lynn Ray, who represents the Tennessee Association of Church Related Schools
and the Pro-Life Action Network and is a consultant with the Family Institute,
calls Atchley "one of my favorite people in the world."
<P>Ray says he isn't entirely comfortable with the Ten Commandments resolution's
urging Tennesseans to post the commandments in "places of worship," because
he believes it is not proper for the state to recommend doctrine to churches.
<P>However, he calls the commandments "truth in its most pristine form" and
says once before the Legislature, the resolution must be passed, lest "disastrous
signals" be sent.
<P>He says Atchley's opponent can expect "no support from the groups I represent
... Everybody I know supports Ben Atchley."
<P>Arch-conservative Blount County Sen. Carl Koella, who used to be known
as the most right-wing member of the General Assembly before the new bunch
got elected, has been a financial angel to the Tennessee Conservative Union.
He is likewise sending negative signals to Emison.
<P>"I've told the group I'm close to cutting off (support from Emison). This
fellow running against Ben's got about as much chance as a snowball in hell.
But it's a nuisance. Ben could be out recruiting candidates instead of having
to fool with this."
<P>Meanwhile, Emison is revving up for an April announcement and says he
will be running (if he does) because "we don't have the kind of Republican
leadership we need to carry on the sort of revolution at the state level
that we have had at the federal level. My concern is that the current leadership
doesn't know what to do with the Republican majority that we have inadvertently
but happily created in the Senate."
<P>Emison, 45, works for an environmental cleanup firm in Oak Ridge. He says
it is Atchley's "minority mentality" that led him to make an "incredibly
premature" pledge of support to John Wilder.
<P>He says his campaign will be based on three issues: term limits (he's
for them), taxes (he's against them), and Atchley's acceptance of political
contributions from the liquor lobby (which he says he will not do).
<P>Emison says he is not a member of the Christian Coalition, but is "very
sympathetic to their fiscal as well as their social issues." He says he has
had conversations about his candidacy with Tennessee Christian Coalition
chairman emeritus John Hanna and will "save him a seat at my announcement.

<P>"John, if you're listening, you're invited!"
<P> 
<P>Lt. Gov. John Wilder, commonly addressed as "Governor," speaks in distinctive,
haiku-like cadences delivered in a thick-as-molasses West Tennessee accent.
He knows Atchley has paid a price for his alliance with the Democrats.
<P>"Ben thinks the decision-making process is better in the state Senate
than it is in Washington, where it is totally partisan and they will bring
the government to its knees rather than act in a nonpartisan way," says Wilder,
who has little patience for anyone who would accuse Atchley of not being
Republican enough.
<P>"Ben is a loyal Republican. Ben is a strong Republican. Nobody holds the
Republican philosophy higher than Ben. Ben believes in production. Ben believes
in something for something, not something for nothing. Ben is solid as a
rock and if all those who serve were like he is, the nation would be like
the state of Tennessee, which is the best, not the worst."
<P>And what does he think of the Ten Commandments resolution?
<P>"Ben has become a media star because of the Ten Commandments. It's not
the first time I've seen the Ten Commandments. Victor Ashe had an ethics
bill that said 'If anybody gives you anything, tell it quick.' There was
an amendment on it, said the Ten Commandments would be our ethics. It's good
ethics. The best. It had a good author and I believe it'll last another day
or two.
<P>"I don't know what the people of Tennessee would do without Ben. Wait.
Don't say that, because life goes on without all of us, eventually. Just
say it would be a big shock to the people of Tennessee to do without him."

<P>Sen. Milton Hamilton is from Union City, up by Reelfoot Lake, hard by
the Missouri border. He has served in the state Senate for 25 years, and
will retire this year (He is expected to be appointed commissioner of
conservation upon his retirement). He switched parties last fall, giving
the GOP its first majority since Reconstruction. He says Atchley is "one
of the major reasons I changed parties ... He's probably the best I've ever
seen at bringing people together."
<P> 
<P>Almost 10 years ago, John Mahon, a professor at Boston University's School
of Management, directed an in-depth study of Atchley's leadership style for
the State Legislative Leaders Foundation (Atchley is now national chairman
of the group). He studied the beginnings of the Wilder coalition and came
to the conclusion that Atchley "legitimizes his power out of respect, not
out of fear ... I have never met a man in my life whose word is his bond
so much as Ben Atchley."
<P>And what does he think now that Atchley has stepped into the spotlight
with his Ten Commandments resolution? Has he changed his mind? Is he surprised
that Atchley would do such a thing?
<P>"Not at all," says Mahon in a telephone interview from his Boston office.
"Ben's an individual who really gives a damn. Not about whether you're
Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, or whatever. What he cares about is that we
need a moral compass. And I don't think he has done this to respond to an
opponent. The hallmark of his career is being willing to take a principled
stand."
<P>Mahon hastens to say that he and Atchley are not close personal friends,
that the two haven't spoken for years, and that the first he knew about the
Ten Commandments resolution was when he read about it in the newspaper.
<P>"I read through the article to see who had sponsored it and saw Ben's
name and I smiled. I tip my hat to him."

</H1><P><STRONG>Some years ago, these Knoxvillians were highly visible, known for their public profile in politics or entertainment or business or education.
Their names were the currency of our common discourse. Their images were woven into the fabric of everyday life. It seemed that everyone knew them and that it had been that way forever.  <BR>Then public attention shifts, or they move on to other opportunities, or they just quietly sink out of sight. And one day someone says, "I wonder
whatever happened to ..." or "What's old ... doing now?" And the chase is on. <BR>Here Metro Pulse tracks down seven of our most pondered missing ones and updates their careers for the benefit of everyone else who's
curious.</STRONG> <BR CLEAR=ALL>
<H3>The Scourge of Our Youth
</H3><P>About 25 years ago, all boys approaching puberty hereabouts hated Little Jimmy Hartsook. He was the country boy with the guitar who had a regular
gig on local shows on all three local TV stations. His pudgy, smiling face was always too clean, his fluffy hair too well combed, his Brady Bunch collars
too big and pointy. When most boys were getting their first jobs hacking privet and pulling up crabgrass for a dollar an hour, Little Jimmy Hartsook was too successful--cutting records, going on tour, appearing on internationally
broadcast television. And worst of all, girls were crazy about him.
<P>But meet Jim Hartsook of Lenoir City, any of you. We dare you. You'd like him.
<P>At 36, he could pass for a dozen years younger, but he's a regular guy. He still grins a lot, but he's lost the cuteness that used to enrage his envious peers. He has short hair now. He's slender, with no trace of his
trademark baby fat, down to earth, funny, and thoroughly unpretentious.
Success--which, after all, lasted only four years or so, ending about
1974--didn't ruin him. 
<P>He moves, laughs, talks, and even sits energetically, as if he's struggling to hold something in. His job, as floor man for an automobile auction company,
seems to fit his personality. The high-pressure, high-energy business would wear out a lower-watt spirit. 
<P>But when Jim Hartsook goes home, he works on his second career, which was really his first: singing, playing guitar, and songwriting. His songs have little in common with each other except that none of them have much in common with the work of Little Jimmy.
<P>He's an animated talker, but often defers to his near-constant companion since childhood, David Price. Hartsook has known Price since the early days of his fame. When Price got married a decade ago, Hartsook sang at his wedding,
maybe his closest thing to a public performance since the '70s. Price is now an Oak Ridge jeweler. But today, Price is Jim Hartsook's whole band, playing guitar, drums and keyboards, and producing their sounds on a complex but compact array of recording equipment Hartsook keeps in a room off his
kitchen. 
<P>Even if you leave Little Jimmy out of the equation, Jim Hartsook is several
people in one. For a high-pressure salesman, he lives an uncommonly thoughtful
life in his tidy rental house, a brick rancher on a hill near the lake, on the rural fringe of a modest Loudon County neighborhood. He has a small
collection of leather-bound nineteenth century books--including Dickens, Cooper, Dante, Irving--plus a larger collection of more than 100 western
paperback novels of the Louis L'Amour variety. "I read a lot," he admits.
<P>He says some still recognize him when he ventures into West Town, or eats at a Knoxville restaurant.
<P>"Aren't you Little Jimmy Hartsook?" they ask. 
<P>"You'd think the Little was on my birth certificate," Hartsook says. Small in stature, he admits many of his neighbors have always called him "Little Jim." He seems to prefer that to "Shorty," a less personal nickname he sometimes
hears on the auction floor.
<P>He does use the first-person pronoun when he talks about "Little Jimmy
Hartsook," but still makes him sound like someone else, a cute little relative
he's especially fond of. He has a couple of framed portraits of Little Jimmy here and there, and his own Little Jimmy Hall of Fame: Little Jimmy and Jerry Lee Lewis (Hartsook found Lewis a likable character, and once even filled in for the Killer when he didn't show up on time); Little Jimmy sitting in Roy Acuff's lap; Little Jimmy and Glen Campbell and gubernatorial candidate John Jay Hooker; Little Jimmy and Fats Domino; Little Jimmy and "Whisperin' Bill" Anderson, who toured with Hartsook and made him a semi-regular on his
national show.
<P>All that's in his music room, a small bedroom off his kitchen where he keeps all the equipment that David Price knows how to use. 
<P>Price offers a sample of what they've taped lately. First comes a
down-and-dirty electric blues piece with country-style vocals; then, a completely
different sound, a version of a lament with Roxy Music-era production. The
melancholy chorus goes: "Like the leaves I have to fall."
<P>Hartsook is almost too modest about his contribution. "All I did was play
guitar and sing," he says. Not to mention write the songs. 
<P>It's this modesty that gets you. It's not like he's tried and failed. Jim Hartsook thinks he hasn't played a public show since 1978, when he was in a loud rock band called Emerald that used to play at Bundulee's on Cumberland.
He's been working on his own music seriously only since last year.
<P>Hartsook scowls remembering one writer who called him "the Donnie Osmond of Country" and the series of circumstances, some sponsor-related, some personal,
that once wedged him out of show business. But he still recalls his brief
experience with stardom in a positive light.
<P>"I just learned so much about people and life, about what's real and what's
not," he says. He credits his mother, who supported but never pressured him, for his equilibrium (she still lives about a mile from his house).
<P>"Sometimes it's hard, though, becoming an adult," he admits. "You do wonder,
'How can I top that?'" 
<P>But for the first time since the '70s, he shrugs, "Little Jim and Company's at it again."
<H3>Back to the Seashore
</H3><P>
<P>Fifteen years ago, what we now call the Old City was a dark, silent ghetto of closed storefronts and empty warehouses. The first person to bring it back to life was perhaps the least likely: a slight, dark-eyed dancer from
coastal England. 
<P>Her name was Annie Delisle, and the French restaurant she opened on Central
near the railroad tracks became an unlikely success, first for its food, and soon for its live jazz. Annie's expanded, doubled in size, acquired an
elaborate patio. In the six years she was the Grande Dame of the Old City,
Delisle personally witnessed the once-abandoned district's metamorphosis into perhaps East Tennessee's liveliest dozen acres.
<P>Then, about six years ago, Delisle abruptly sold her business. Annie's became Lucille's. Her move probably seemed more sudden to casual acquaintances
than it did to her.
<P>"The restaurant was doing well, but I wasn't making much money," she says.
"It's the hardest business, 18 to 20 hours a day, home at 4 in the morning. It was just constant. I was at the end of my tether. I walked in there one night, I had everyone calling my name. These people love me, but I'm tired.
<P>"It was disappointing, in a way. And yet I had a six-year party. We had some great parties: Melissa Gilbert, David Keith. I miss those parties. I miss knowing so many people. I miss the artists as much as anything. I live a very quiet life here."
<P>"I honestly didn't think I wanted to spend the rest of my life in Knoxville,"
admits Delisle, who grew up in an English seaside village in Hampshire. Here
between the mountains, she missed the seashore acutely. 
<P>"Also, I was very insecure" running her own business in Knoxville, she says. "I thought, why not go into corporate and be taken care of, with my
benefits paid for." 
<P>After an extended visit with her brother in Australia, she settled in Florida. 
<P>"I drove into Palm Beach, I said to myself, This is where I want to live."
Even if it wasn't Hampshire, exactly. "This is like Nirvana. I felt I've died and gone to heaven."
<P>Delisle went to work for the Ritz-Carlton hotel chain and also considered work as an airline hostess. She now works as a receptionist for an upscale
banking company. "We're in investments and trust accounts. We don't deal with anyone with less than a couple million." That's a big difference from
Annie's days, when she was dealing with anybody who had two dollars for a beer.
<P>She now lives in a little house of her own in West Palm Beach. She misses
friends. "Not enough people from Tennessee come to visit me," she says with the merest trace of petulance "They love that Knoxville so much." 
<P>She does visit occasionally, most recently in November, and takes an interest
in downtown's growth. She approves of the current management of Lucille's, which opted to nurture the proven Annie's ambiance.
<P>"I walked in on a Saturday night and the same band was playing--Donald Brown and Keith on drums--like nothing had changed."
<H3>Forward to the Past
</H3><P>
<P>Wade Houston didn't have to break new ground when he left the University of Tennessee in 1994. He simply picked up most of his activities from the life he had led before taking the job of head coach for the UT men's basketball
program.
<P>Houston, who had been an assistant coach at the University of Louisville,
returned to the Kentucky city to a trucking business in which he'd had an
interest before coming to Tennessee. His wife, Alice, had been actively involved
in the business since 1982.
<P>"We have four different companies that do specialized hauling," Houston says. "The company I run is the flatbed trucking division, which hauls aluminum,
steel, heavy machinery and oversized loads."
<P>Houston left UT after his teams posted weak records for several years. His main contact with sports now is watching his children perform.
<P>"Up to this point, most of my basketball has been watching Allan play,"
Houston says. His son, Allan, was the star player on Houston's UT teams and now plays for the Detroit Pistons. "I also have season tickets to watch my old school (the University of Louisville) play."
<P>He has a new sport to follow as well. Daughter Lynn at Georgia Tech recently
won the high-jump championship of the Atlantic Coast Conference. While in
Knoxville, Lynn had been on four track-and-field championship teams at Farragut
High School. Houston says she hopes to go for a spot on the U.S. Olympic team, but will have to improve her jumps by a couple of inches to be competitive.
<P>Alcoa is one of Houston's trucking clients, and he comes back to the area to call on them and to visit family in Blount County.
<P>"I normally come down for a weekend," he says. "I enjoy seeing parents,
friends and relatives."
<H3>A View from San Francisco
</H3><P>
<P>A focal point of the panoramic view from Phillip Moffitt's hillside home just north of San Francisco is the Golden Gate Bridge. It's very name is
emblematic of the passage to a new life which Moffitt made following the 1986 breakup of the then thriving media empire he co-founded with Chris Whittle.
<P>Moffitt's 20-year alter-ego relationship with Whittle, dating back to their student days at UT in the 1960s, had turned into one full of altercations.
When they split, Moffitt took their flagship publication, Esquire, which he had moved to New York to run after they audaciously acquired it in 1979. That left Whittle with the potpourri of publications based in Knoxville which
became the nucleus of the now defunct Whittle Communications.
<P>Unlike Whittle, Moffitt, then 40, didn't crave a monumental media empire of his own. And before 1986 was over he'd sold Esquire to Hearst Corp. for a payoff that made him a millionaire many times over.
<P>Then came the relocation to the San Francisco Bay area with a resolve to keep his pot of gold intact and to focus on more personal endeavors. "Don't
even get near me" with propositions for any new publishing ventures, he says.
While his penchant for the printed word still stirs, he's channeled it instead
into co-authorship of two photo-journalism books on medicine. He is also writing a novel.
<P>And while Moffitt's devotion to yoga and other forms of meditation dates back to his youthful years in Knoxville, he's now devoting considerably more time to teaching as well as practicing these arts.
<P>"I know this sounds esoteric to a lot of people, but I'm very practical about it," Moffitt says. "Yoga has been a source of self-understanding and
empowerment in my life, and I'm interested in helping other people empower
themselves as well."
<P>For all of the transcendence in his life, Moffitt hasn't totally rejected the business world. In 1990, he co-founded a software company in a Marin County community near his home. He now serves as its chairman, but not in a full-time executive capacity. The company, Light Source, hasn't rivaled the big Silicon Valley success stories of the decade. But Moffitt says its
software for the measurement and communication of color has been a boon to highly color-conscious desktop publishers.
<P>Moffitt has also maintained ties to Knoxville, where his two brothers live, and to his boyhood home of Kingsport, where his parents reside. He visits once or twice a year, and still owns a cabin in South Knoxville that's
part of a complex where compatriots from a bygone era gather every now and then.
<H3>Still Seeing the Conservative Light
</H3><P>
<P>One prominent political observer calls former Knoxville state representative
Charles Pete Drew a chameleon. While the black ex-legislator never changed his color, he certainly changed his stripe, embracing the conservative Republican
faith in 1985 after a lifetime of liberal Democratic stewardship.
<P>"I didn't see the liberal social agenda ever putting inner city people in a position where they could survive in a capitalist society," says Drew, who now lives in St. Elmo, a low-to-moderate-income district of Chattanooga.
"That's what drove me to leave the Democratic party."
<P>Drew, 57, served three terms as a Knox County commissioner before capturing
the District 15 seat in the state House of Representatives in 1982. After winning a second term in '84, the former hard-line Democrat changed parties and won again, as a Republican, in 1986.
<P>Drew describes his conversion as an evolution, influenced by U.S. Senate
Republican moderates Bill Brock and Howard Baker, and brought to fruition by Maryville's red-flannel Republican, Lamar Alexander.
<P>Others note that, upon switching, Drew received a hefty fee to serve as a minority consultant to the Republican Party and that then-governor Alexander
made plenty of political hay by parading his high-profile convert across the state like a prize-winning show horse.
<P>"There definitely appeared to be a conflict of interest, although I'm not so sure Pete wasn't getting used more than he was doing the using," says a local conservative leader. "Pete may well be sincere about his philosophical
shift, but I think the party change had more to do with buckram politics than anything."
<P>While the switch may have seemed opportunistic, Drew has toed the line
ideologically ever since--even, he says, when his conservative credo proved less than politically advantageous.
<P>"I have a tendency to take my commitment a little farther than my ability to protect myself," Drew says. "You can only function at the level where you can protect yourself for the next election, and I very often got out a little too far from an ideological standpoint."
<P>That's what Drew says happened in 1988, when he lost his house seat to liberal black Democrat Joe Armstrong. With his Knoxville contracting business
facing several lawsuits and his stream of political capital running dry, Drew moved to Nashville in 1990 to lobby for Tennessee Right to Life. He pulled up stakes again in 1993, accepting a job with the Chattanooga Resource
Foundation, a conservative Christian leadership coalition with an aggressive
political agenda.
<P>Nowadays, he and his wife, Joyce, live in St. Elmo with their two sons,
Charles Kennedy and Christopher. Drew oversees Chattanooga Food Source, a food distribution program that began under the auspices of the foundation, and he and Joyce both work as tutors for low-income students through Bill
Clinton's Americorps program.
<P>But Drew says his days of stumping and hand-pumping aren't over yet. He ran for Hamilton County Commission shortly after moving to Chattanooga, losing
badly by most accounts. Undaunted, he plans another run for the state legislature
in '96, mounting his campaign on a pro-life,
get-the-government-out-of-the-inner-city platform.
<P>Does Republican Drew see any incongruity in advocating inner city
self-sufficiency while working for a Democratic president's inner city welfare
outreach?
<P>"We work in that particular area of the program because of what it does," Drew says simply. "Not because of who founded it."
<H3>UT Pioneer for Congress
</H3><P>
<P>The woman many credit with first bringing a feminist perspective to the
University of Tennessee in the early '70s is hoping to take it to Congress as a U.S. representative from West Virginia.
<P>Sharon Lord, a self-described "hillbilly feminist radical" from Williamson, W. Va., taught psychology and education at UT from 1969 to 1980.
<P>"In 1971, she was the first woman many of us had ever heard talk about women's rights, women and power, and the role of women," says one of her
intimates from that time. "She had the audacity to say things no one had ever said before."
<P>Lord taught the psychology of women, of sex role development and of the
disadvantaged child, using the courses to explore the empowerment of individuals
and groups.
<P>"It was a wonderful thing she did," says one who knew her then.
<P>She was not without critics. Friends from that period say the university
administration wasn't especially pleased to have the white male power structure
challenged. And her own attraction to power brought her criticism from other
women who worked with and around her, and accused her of suffering from the
"queen bee syndrome."
<P>Her philosophy of education as a window of opportunity for helping others
motivated her to work on the develop of the school's Women's Studies program and to begin a network of women in Knoxville that is still influential today.
<P>She was also involved in revamping the woman's athletic program, working
closely with Archie Dykes, which resulted in Pat Head being hired as the woman's head coach.
<P>"I've been called the grandmother of the Lady Vols," she says, "When I left UT, it wasn't because it hadn't been wonderful."
<P>She departed in 1980 with the intention of working full-time at her own
business, a human-resources consulting firm, but she was hired by the U.S.
Department of Defense. There she became the highest ranking female in the Defense Department, a civilian position comparable to a three-star general. 
<P>"I was quite honored, but there should have already been higher-ranking
females," Lord says.
<P>During the Reagan years, she played a pivotal role in creating the sexual
harassment policy for the Armed Forces. For her work, she was awarded the
second-highest civilian medal for outstanding public service. 
<P>Lord also continued working part-time with her consulting firm and has done work for the governments of Australia and New Zealand. She sits on the board of trustees of the University of West Virginia and has just recently
decided to run for Congress from southern West Virginia.
<P>Lord still has a piece of land in the Smokies, which she calls Paradise
Valley. "Paradise Valley is where my heart is," Lord says, "I try to spend time there writing. It keeps my feet on the ground."
<H3>On the Entrepreneurial Trail
</H3><P>
<P>Dwight Kessel says he doesn't talk a lot about politics these days, but he does have a pithy observation about Steve Forbes:
<P>"People won't give you money (political contributions) if you have money. They know they can't control you."
<P>This is something Kessel, who served in public office for 31 years, knows a good bit about. His wealth is legendary, and so is his ornery independence. Not long ago, some UT officials held a roast to thank Kessel and his wife Gloria for giving the school a gazillion bucks, and his old friend Jim Haslam
called him "a guy that never had a political organization in his life and never wanted one." Kessel doesn't know if Haslam meant that as a compliment, but he thinks it's pretty accurate.
<P>If you ask him what he's doing, the first thing the former county executive
mentions is co-teaching the Adult Three Sunday school class at First Baptist
Church.
<P>"Adult Three. If you say it real quick it sounds nasty," he jokes.
<P>Kessel, who served as a city councilman, county clerk and county executive,
left office in September 1994 after he was defeated in a reelection bid. These days, he operates out of an office at Knox Air, which has a contract to refuel all military aircraft in the Southeast, as well as Delta, TWA, USAir and assorted small craft that come and go from Knoxville.
<P>He is working on the startup of the JCL Corporation, which has developed a highly accurate test to diagnose lung and colon cancer. He is on the board of directors, and (although he doesn't say it) he has probably helped
financially. He does admit that he "got them lined up with the British market,"
and he's hoping the product will be ready soon.
<P>He's on the board of Geriatric Medical Services, which runs geriatric wards in seven states. His partner in that business is a geriatric psychologist.
"That's why we get along so good," Kessel says.
<P>He's also developing a condominium subdivision, helping an Internet company
get off the ground, and is president of a multistate real estate concern.
<P>He sits on a bunch of charitable boards, including the East Tennessee
Foundation, heads a fund-raising drive for the UT College of Engineering, and takes a keen interest in the students who are pursuing engineering degrees on Kessel-funded scholarships.
<P>He's still playing racquetball at the Downtown YMCA with John Harber, Don Leake, Randy Vineyard and some other guys two or three times a week, and says he's feeling good.
<P>And that he's just about as busy as he wants to be.

A Tale of Two Job Markets</H1>
<P><STRONG>Knoxville's skilled labourers find opportunities aplenty while high-tech professionals are left wanting</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Mike Gibson</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>After 10 years of higher education, 15 years of research experience and 18 months of unemployment, Bill Davis tossed his Cal-Berkeley Ph.D., his resume and his professional pride in a filing cabinet drawer and signed up for a paper route.<P>
Davis, a lanky 48-year-old with a wire-bristle beard and a wispy throw-rug of graying brown hair, lost his job as an experimental physicist with a small Oak Ridge firm in 1991.<P>
It was the second time the native Oregonian had been a cutback casualty; he was forced out of Y-12's fusion energy division in 1984, but landed a position with Atom Sciences, a private company founded by former ORNL scientists.<P>
But when Atom Sciences downsized in early '91, Davis found a far less hospitable market, short on jobs and beset with other displaced high-tech seekers. Within months, his unemployment benefits ended, his savings ran dry, and Davis began looking for work that didn't require a physics Ph.D.<P>
"I wasn't exactly prepared for this," Davis says. "When my savings ran out, I started doing anything I could to earn a dollar. I mowed lawns, I did yard work, I helped an acquaintance remodel a house--I even catered a wedding."<P>
The loss of income--and health insurance benefits--also shackled Davis's efforts to provide for his youngest daughter, 16-year-old Beth, who suffers from a variety of physical handicaps as well as a severe learning disorder. And while his wife, Sarah, eventually moved from part-time tutoring into full-time teaching, the couple often wonders whether the extra income compensates for the time lost with Beth.<P>
Davis now works two jobs; by day, he's a lab technician at CSI in Knoxville, earning an hourly wage plus benefits. At night and on weekends, he abstracts technical information for another Oak Ridge company on his home computer. And although he works as much as 70 hours a week between his free-lance and full-time jobs, his annual income still falls well short of a year's salary at Atom Sciences.<P>
"It's been disappointing," Davis says. "But there are an awful lot of other people out there ... doing jobs that need a lot less skill than they have. I would still love to have a research position close to physics, but I don't think that's practical today."
<H3> </H3>
Economists call it "underemployment." Dr. Robert Greenberg, director of the University of Tennessee's placement services, refers to "disconnection"--the difference between what employers are prepared to offer and what highly educated professionals need and are willing to take.<P>
Whichever buzzword you choose, it describes a puzzling, almost paradoxical local phenomenon--one that's seen rising fortunes for wage-earning laborers in and around Knox County even as it's witnessed careers run aground among professionals like Davis. It describes a single city with two dramatically different job markets.<P>
According to state Office of Employment Security figures, the unemployment rate for the Knoxville metropolitan statistical area (including Knox and surrounding counties) dropped steadily over the last five years, from 5.4 percent in 1991 to less than 4 percent--the level of so-called full employment--in 1995.<P>
What those statistics reflect is a generally healthy local (and national) economy--an economy finally recovering from early '90s recession, and spawning growth in the manufacturing and service sectors.<P>
"The blue-collar downsizings of the 1980s are over," observes Joe Stegmayer, president of Clayton Homes, Inc. "Those workers have found jobs again, industry has revitalized after some slow growth, and lots of jobs have been created around Knoxville--especially in the area of services."<P>
"Manufacturing has been on the rise in the southeast the last several years, and Tennessee is riding the crest of that wave," adds Dr. Matthew Murray, associate director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at UT. "The state has enjoyed exceptionally strong employment growth. It's outstripped the nation in that regard, to the point that we're starting to gobble up the available labor force."<P>
What the numbers don't show is that the recovery held fewer benefits for college-educated workers than for their less well-educated counterparts, and that other factors, such as the region's heavy reliance on federal employers, have contributed to a shrinking market for certain classes of professionals.<P>
"What Knoxville really has is lots of $5 to $8 per hour jobs," says Terry Callahan of the Office of Employment Security. "It's not uncommon to see very educated people, people with master's degrees and Ph.D.'s, working for $7 or $8 an hour. When you get up into the career-type jobs, there's a definite shortage. It's pretty crowded up at the top."
<H3> </H3>
Callahan and other observers point to several factors that have made job-seeking increasingly difficult for even well-credentialed members of certain professions--accountants, middle managers, most engineers, scientific researchers, etc.<P>
Topping the list are massive government, corporate and even small-business cutbacks:
<UL>
<LI> In 1993, the Tennessee Valley Authority began phasing out more than 2,600 jobs, including many engineering, managerial and administrative positions. Nearly 350 of those jobs were based in Knox County.
<LI> Since 1992, Lockheed Martin, the private company contracted to run Department of Energy facilities in Oak Ridge, has reduced employment by more than 1,000 across three divisions, with more cutbacks expected. Those losses were accompanied by more cutbacks in the private sector among the many high-tech firms that rely on federal contracts.
<LI> Homegrown media giant Whittle Communications folded in 1994-95, eliminating more than 700 white-collar (administrative, editorial, marketing, etc.) jobs from the Knoxville market.<P>
</UL>
<P>Compounding the problem, says Greenberg, is the presence of a large university pumping out thousands of graduates every year into an area that, with its four-season climate and rural/urban amenities, turns many of its visitors into settlers.
<P>"To a point, this condition is common in towns with large universities," Greenberg says. "You've got lots of grads who want to stay in town but a local market that isn't going to absorb that many new faces. That's the reason we see so many college grads working at hourly positions that don't really require their degrees."<P>
Greenberg notes that among a recent crop of seniors registered with the UT placement office, less than a third of the business graduates and only about one-fifth of the engineering graduates found jobs in the Knoxville area. (By contrast, among liberal arts graduates, majors more amenable to going with the flow, about one-half remained in or around Knox County.)<P>
For professionals who stay in Knoxville, the competition is fierce. Local TVA spokesman Frank Cason reports that it's not uncommon for the agency to receive more than 100 resumes for an advertised engineering position. The president of a small local headhunting firm (who prefers not to be identified) says she recently passed along more than 60 resumes for a junior quality engineer's position, and more than 50 for an accounting job.<P>
"Unless it's a very specialized job, I usually have a lot more resumes than jobs to fill," she says. "In this market, people are going to have to consider themselves independent contractors. They're going to have to sell themselves to potential employers and show companies just what they can add to their bottom line."<P>
In most cases, she adds, that means accepting salaries that don't meet their expectations.<P>
"People who were used to making $50,000 a year are going to have a hard time convincing another company they're worth that much," she says. "I deal with a lot of people who are looking for more money than I'm able to find for them."<P>
At headhunting firm Snelling and Snelling, General Manager Greg O'Connor estimates that he sees at least 10 candidates for every engineering or accounting position he fills. Many of those applicants are experienced professionals who, though jobless, are unwilling to uproot households or leave family and friends.<P>
"You've got guys who've been with a company 20 years, and don't know anything else," O'Connor says. "These people will wait and wait and use up all their savings. It's falling to us to do bigger sales jobs with the companies we work with."
<H3> </H3>
Charles Lowe was living in a cheap Fort Sanders apartment and working at a fast food restaurant when he discovered that his girlfriend Lisa was six weeks pregnant.<P>
"I knew it was time for me to straighten up and get ready if I was going to have a kid," Lowe says. "And the first thing I needed to do was to get a better job."<P>
Lowe, 22, had taken shop classes when he was a student at Central High School, so he answered a classified ad soliciting entry level welders. Days later, he was earning $6.90 per hour as a welding trainee at Plasti-Line, Inc. in Powell. He received a raise of more than $1.50 before his 90-day training and probationary period had ended, and now earns more than $10 per hour in a permanent full-time position.<P>
In addition to his hourly wage, Lowe has full health insurance benefits and looks forward to a sizable raise, as well as two weeks of paid vacation, when he celebrates his first anniversary at Plasti-Line.<P>
He and Lisa also look forward to a September wedding, and to making a down payment on a house sometime next year.<P>
"I actually have a bank account now," Lowe laughs. "We just bought a new kitchen table, a VCR, a TV and a new rocking chair for my baby. I'm doing 10 times better financially than I ever have before."<P>
Lowe's circumstances aren't unusual. According to most industry leaders and employment service recruiters, workers looking for jobs outside the professional ranks all but have their pick of high-paying manufacturing, clerical and service positions. It's what economists call an "employee's market," and it's forced many local companies to offer new incentives to a class of workers they may have once taken for granted.<P>
"There's a tight labor market for blue-collar jobs right now," says Jennifer Holder, marketing director for Staffing Solutions by Cobble. "We've had to rethink the way we recruit and advertise to get new workers."<P>
According to Bill Cobble, president of Cobble Staffing Companies, hourly and blue-collar employers are now confronting the down side of a business cycle that, from the corporate perspective, peaked in 1991.<P>
"Around '90 and '91,  there were plenty of workers and not enough jobs," Cobble says. "The economy gradually absorbed that bubble of people. Then, around 1994, we started running into worker shortages, and it got to where you couldn't fill certain low-skilled positions no matter how many advertisements you ran."<P>
Cobble cites demographic trends, like fewer untapped pockets of women and minorities, as factors in the worker shortage. Murray echoes those themes and also points to rampant industrial growth statewide, fostered by low taxes and land values, minimal regulation and proximity to population centers.<P>
Murray says most of that growth has taken place near the state's major metropolitan areas, although the surrounding counties, rather than the cities themselves, are often responsible for creating most of the jobs. Around Knoxville for example, industrial growth in Blount and Anderson counties, and tourism/service growth in Sevier County, have kept pace with or outstripped growth in Knox County.<P>
Those expansions exerted a powerful upward push on wages and have all but put an end to minimum-wage-only jobs. Cobble says the minimum threshold for temp service jobs had already risen from below $5 per hour to nearly $6 per hour when he sold a portion of Cobble Personnel to Staffing Solutions last year, and most local fast food restaurants now start new employees at nearly a dollar an hour more than the $4.35 minimum.<P>
"We don't even try to touch anything that's less than $6 per hour now, and most of our jobs offer even more than that," says Holder of Staffing Solutions. "You can't do enough advertising to get people interested in $5 per hour wages."<P>
The scarcity of workers and corresponding wage inflation have also given economic development officials reason to pause. Although the outlook hasn't reached crisis proportions, many industrial recruiters  admit that the dearth of low-cost labor casts a foreboding shadow over their efforts.<P>
"Our problem right now is finding qualified workers," says Jim Cooper of Melton Hill Regional Development in Anderson County. "We've pulled in 23 manufacturers in 11 years, and the labor pool has taken a beating. It's causing some recruiting problems, but not to the point where people are scared off in a big way."
<H3> </H3>
Plummeting professional stock and the concurrent rising fortunes of less-schooled workers have also made for an economic and social dynamic that has blurred many of the lines that once separated two distinct labor populations.<P>
Even as highly educated workers lower their expectations and take jobs that offer fewer perks and less prestige, many factory workers are pulling in wage and benefit packages that are competitive with the salaries earned by their better-dressed counterparts sitting at desks in other parts of the building.<P>
O'Connor says he expects nearly half of the engineers who file resumes with Snelling to change their career expectations in order to stay in the area--to the point that many of his food service placements, especially managerial positions, come from the ranks of disillusioned would-be and former engineers.<P>
And although their new jobs will probably entail longer hours, lower paychecks and more physically demanding work, O'Connor says the professional converts place a higher premium on stability and peace of mind.<P>
"There are lots of Oak Ridge people who are tired of wondering whether they'll lose their next job at the end of the year," O'Connor says. "They're seeking permanence, and they're willing to make major changes instead of pulling up roots."<P>
LeRoy Beasley, president of the Tennessee Valley Authority Engineering Association, says many of the engineers sliced off TVA payrolls in recent years were forced to seek other careers, working for motels or managing sandwich shops.<P>
And still other professionals are seeking professional jobs through temporary services--jobs that may end on a week's notice, or that may not provide benefits.<P>
"The fastest-growing area of temp services are in the professional and technical fields," says one job service employee. "The work force is increasingly contracted out, especially the parts that aren't part of a company's normal business, like accounting or human resources. It's a much different landscape than it was 10 years ago."<P>
In the meantime, many area manufacturers are offering increasingly hefty incentives, and struggling to stay abreast of any changes in the status of their blue-collar work force. Camille Babb, director of human resources at DeRoyal Industries, says her company responded to an increasingly competitive labor market by hiring a compensation analyst, and implemented a 401K plan, as well as special pay structures for certain divisions, at his behest.<P>
"People in the semi-skilled positions will leave for even very small bumps in pay," Babb says. "If you're not keeping up with the changes, you'll be left behind."<P>
Clayton Homes' human resource personnel have had little trouble finding capable new employees, Stegmayer says. But he also admits that Clayton has been willing to pay for performance--with double-figure hourly wages at some area plants, with a 401K plan that sees Clayton match employee contributions dollar for dollar, with an expansive health plan, and with automatic raises whenever business improves (the company has averaged 23 percent annual growth since 1991.)<P>
"I don't know if I'd call the wage situation competitive, but certainly wages have risen over recent years," Stegmayer says. "And we have been heavily incentive-oriented."
<H3> </H3>
While analysts and business leaders seem to agree on what the local labor market looks like, they all have different ideas about how its complexion will change in the coming years.<P>
According to Murray, Knoxville's blue collar outlook hearkens back to Econ 101 and the law of supply and demand: workers will migrate to the area as long as jobs are plentiful, and current competitive advantages will gradually disappear (Melton Hill's Cooper notes that Anderson County plants are already attracting factory hands from southeastern Kentucky).<P>
"The trend will likely continue for many years to come," Murray says. "Eventually, the population grows, taxes increase, labor costs bid up, disincentives arise and things will level off."<P>
What will happen to the area's disenfranchised business class is a chancier guess. Murray says the problem is structural unemployment--job losses related to long-range trends rather than short-term business cycles--and compares it to the squeeze placed on Tennessee manufacturers (of textiles in particular) in the 1980s, when many factory jobs moved overseas.<P>
"You might speculate that we're squeezing the other end of the corporate budget now," Murray says. "It takes a while for these sorts of job losses to work their way out of the system."<P>
According to a recent Wall Street Journal survey, Knoxville's pool of underemployed college-educated workers bodes well for its future. Citing Oak Ridge and TVA cutbacks, the publication said Knoxville has been a "metropolitan also-ran" in recent years, but predicted better times as the region's private interests take advantage of a "brainy work force" and abundant natural resources.<P>
But according to consultants at DRI/McGraw-Hill, a California firm commissioned by DOE to assess the economic prospects of the 16-county East Tennessee Resource Valley, the region may see dramatic downturns in most of its key industries in the early part of the 21st century. And one of the ways DRI consultants believe local industry can stave off disaster is by harnessing more of the human and technological resources left in the wake of cutbacks.<P>
Whether these analyses hold any grain of truth, or whether they're just floundering recognition of the underlying problem, remains to be seen. What is clear is that one way or another those untapped resources won't remain dormant forever.<P>
"My eldest daughter is in college, and I really have no interest in placing Beth in any other Tennessee school system," says Bill Davis. "I feel constrained to this area right now. When they're both finished, I may well have very different feelings."<P>

The Varieties of Religious Experience</H1>
<P><STRONG>The fundamentalists get all the press, but religious people with a more liberal attitude toward their faith are thriving among us</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Bill Dockery</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>
No one speaks.<P>
Almost 40 people are sitting in simple folding chairs arranged in two ovals, one within the other.<P>
Everyone is dressed casually, with sneakers and outdoor gear much in evidence. Some sit with heads bowed and eyes closed. Others maintain a gaze fixed slightly above the heads of their fellows, looking out the floor-to-ceiling windows at the surrounding woodland. Few people make eye contact.<P>
Ten minutes pass, and still no one speaks.<P>
One woman holds a toddler who occasionally takes the bottle but stirs very little otherwise. Two older men with white hair sit in the outer circle. Several kids squat on the floor near the door, making no noise and only occasionally stealing furtive glances at one another.<P>
More heads bow; more eyes close. A couple of latecomers enter quietly and take seats, and a few minutes later, without a sound, all the young people leave with two adults.<P>
Then, just as the group appears almost mesmerized, a young woman speaks, an almost startling event after the silence.<P>
"Fear not, I am with thee; O be not afraid, for I am thy God and will still give thee aid. I'll strengthen thee, help thee and cause thee to stand upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand."<P>
As the words of the familiar hymn fade, the silence returns, and more time passes.<P>
Just as abruptly, another woman offers the group two rhymed lines from another hymn. Then a woman sitting in the inner row shares a musing about the kids who are visiting her house, contrasting their energy and noise to the stillness of this meeting. She talks about paradox and how the Spirit hovering over this meeting is no different from the inner Spirit that illuminates each individual.<P>
Stillness returns for a few more minutes. Then at an unspoken signal from the clerk of the meeting, the people come out of their meditative state, shake hands and greet each other warmly. The members of the group introduces themselves, and some ask for special attention for people not at the meeting. ("My mother is undergoing cataract surgery. Please hold her in the light.") One member offers up information on the status of gun control bills and other legislation in Congress.<P>
The group disperses for an Easter egg hunt, and thus a recent First Day meeting of Quakers in West Knoxville ends.<P>
This gathering of the West Knoxville Friends Meeting is just one example of religious groups in Knoxville that don't fit the stereotypical image of religion in East Tennessee.<P>
Many consider Knoxville to be in the middle of the Bible Belt, the center of a religious world view that insists the Scriptures be taken literally, eschews such activities as drinking and dancing, condemns homosexuality and wants to force those religious and social mores on others. That stereotype--made up of equal parts Elmer Gantry, Billy Graham and Pat Robertson--colors not only newcomers' perceptions of Knoxville but also molds the way local people think of themselves.<P>
Knoxville's religious climate is more complex than that. The Bible Belt may be buckled here, but many Knoxvillians choose to hold up their spiritual britches in other ways. The metropolitan area is home to a diverse group of Quakers, United Church of Christ members, Unitarian Universalists, and Metropolitan Community Church members--congregations with their roots in Christianity who bring a generally more liberal approach to their faith.<P>
<H3>LABELS IN DISPUTE</H3>
<P>Like definitions of fundamentalism and conservatism, the meaning of liberalism in religion is much debated and often rejected by the people to whom it is applied.<P>
"The terms liberal and conservative are political terms and should not be associated with churches," says Marilyn Jacobson, a Catholic involved in many religious activities in Knoxville. "The word liberal is so separating."<P>
The Rev. Jim Richardson is also uncomfortable with the label.<P>
"It's social issues where the distinction gets drawn," says Richardson, who pastors the Metropolitan Community Church of Knoxville. "Until 1990, fundamentalists were inward-looking and liberals were outward-looking.<P>
"That's not true anymore; now fundamentalists are more deeply immersed in social issues than liberals ever were."<P>
Brooks Holifield, who teaches in the Candler School of Theology at Emory University, notes that liberalism has meant something different in every century, but he hazards a definition that might apply broadly across liberal religious movements.<P>
"At the heart of liberal Christianity has been the sense that the formulations of Christian belief or the expressions of Christian belief have to be reformulated in every era, in light of the best knowledge of that time," says Holifield, who is the Charles Howard Candler professor of American church history. "Liberals in the 19th century could no longer feel that a literal interpretation of scriptural books could get at what Christianity or Judaism was about in light of knowledge of the modern world."<P>
Despite the debate over terminology, a variety of local churches put on the mantle of liberal religion and offer alternatives to the fundamentalist Christianity that often passes in the public eye as the only way to be religious. These local congregations vary greatly among themselves but they usually share, to one degree or another, several characteristics.<P>
<LI> Liberal churches often take a nonliteral approach to Scripture, recognizing it as divinely inspired but making use of interpretive methods that put biblical documents into historical perspective.<P>
<LI> While religious people of all stripes--conservative, moderate and liberal--shoulder a huge portion of society's charitable works, liberal religious groups have stood out over the years as advocates for downtrodden groups. As Richardson notes, that has been changing recently as conservative churches have become more politically and socially active.<P>
<LI> Hearkening back to 16th-century religious persecution and disputes, many refuse to recognize explicit creeds or doctrinal statements of faith, valuing individual conscience over corporate expressions of theology drawn up by church bodies.<P>
<LI> Finally, many emphasize acceptance and an ecumenical approach to other denominations and religions.<P>
<H3>NO DOCTRINAL STANDARDS</H3>
<P>
The West Knoxville Friends Meeting shows these characteristics to a varying extent.<P>
"Friends traditionally are very diverse," says co-clerk Kathleen Mavournin. "There are no doctrinal standards for admission. Theologically, we run the gamut from those who are Christocentric to those of us who are universalists."<P>
Mavournin explains that for her universalism means acknowledgment of a kind of universal deity, a recognition that "all names for God are equally valid," in contrast to the more traditional Quaker understanding of Christ.<P>
After attending the now disbanded Epworth United Ministry in Fort Sanders for many years, Mavournin says she tried on a Quaker service, attending with friends in Maryville.<P>
"I knew about Quaker social witnesses, and I knew about waiting on the Spirit and silent meetings. The first meeting I attended was completely silent. No one spoke at all during the service," she remembers.<P>
"I was really overwhelmed by the experience. The spiritual presence in that room was palpable. I've been a Quaker ever since."<P>
Started in the mid-'50s, the West Knoxville Meeting (Quakers don't call their organizations church) has about 60 members, 20 to 40 of whom can usually be found on Sunday in their meeting house, a green ranch-style building which sits a couple of turns off Chert Pit Road on three wooded lots amid subdivisions. The large majority of the members are what Quakers called "convinced" Friends, converts, instead of "birthright" Quakers who are born into a Quaker family.<P>
The group has been active in financial support of several national Quaker organizations, notably the Friends Committee on National Legislation, and individual members are involved in many social projects, including one that brings children to the United States to give them relief from the violence in Northern Ireland.<P>
"Our meeting is undergoing a discernment process to try and choose a social involvement project for us to undertake as a group," Mavournin says. Reflecting the traditional Quaker emphasis on nonviolence, the group is studying ways to provide a presence in local high schools that will be an alternative to Junior ROTC programs.<P>
Another Quaker group, the First Friends Church of Knoxville, meets in East Knoxville under the leadership of the Rev. Dr. E. L. Votaw. Though similar in basic belief, the First Friends group has what Quakers called programmed services, using a minister to lead a set program of worship. The congregation is active in such traditional Quaker activities as prison ministries, work at Lakeshore Mental Health Institute and peace testimonies.<P>
<H3>ROOM AT THE TABLE</H3>
<P>
Like Knoxville Friends, members of the Church of the Savior, United Church of Christ, on Weisgarber Road, are socially active, but their church holds more to what the Rev. John Gill calls "the stream of Trinitarian Christianity."<P>
"As a Christian church, we see the Bible as the word of God. We read the Bible to get insight into the meaning of human life and the nature of the universe," Gill says. "We believe that Jesus demonstrated a welcome for all people that went against the grain of authority in his day."<P>
Theologically, the Church of the Savior emphasizes love, forgiveness and the welcoming grace of God rather than judgment, Gill says. The church has 90 members, some 65 or 70 of whom attend services on any given Sunday. For all its small presence in Knoxville, the denomination boasts a membership of 6 million nationwide.<P>
"In the United Church of Christ, there's an emphasis on freedom of belief. We respect people's diversity of understanding of the Bible and try to dialogue about that."<P>
As a denomination, the United Church of Christ is heir to the Congregationalist Christian Church and the Evangelical and Reformed Church, which merged in 1957. The church, both locally and nationally, is deliberate in its philosophy of inclusiveness; it has been ordaining women for over a century and now ordains homosexuals.<P>
"Inclusiveness is one of the most distinctive things about the United Church of Christ. We're striving to reach out and be open to all people who seek God," Gill says.<P>
"There's room at Christ's table for all God's children. That kind of inclusive spirit is what we strive for. We find that that's the spirit of God that nurtures us in our lives, and we feel a responsibility to express that kind of spirit in the world."<P>
In keeping with that philosophy, the denomination has sought to reconcile itself to people of other faiths, notably the Jewish community and, more recently, native Hawaiians. The Congregational Church was the first to evangelize Hawaii, and modern UCC members have contributed a fairly large reparation fund to be used for charity on the island.<P>
That spirit of inclusiveness is what led Church of the Savior to provide meeting space for the Metropolitan Community Church, which has held Sunday evening services there since 1985. <P>
<H3>AN OPPRESSED SEGMENT</H3>
<P>
The Metropolitan Community Church's specific mission is to serve gay, lesbian and bisexual people, says Jim Richardson, pastor of the church's Knoxville congregation, though he is quick to point out that the membership is not restricted to that group.<P>
"We're open to an oppressed segment of our society," Richardson says. "We welcome people where they are."<P>
Formerly a Presbyterian (U.S.A.) minister, Richardson says the local MCC church gets many of its 125 members and 400 constituents from extreme fundamentalist denominations--the Southern Baptists, the Church of God, and the Church of Christ--who condemn homosexuality. Otherwise he says he's not comfortable with labels.<P>
"Some liberals would call me call me at least middle of the road," he says. "Theologically I wouldn't call myself a liberal, but socially I am. When it comes to human needs, I think that society has a responsibility to understand them and deal with them. And that's a liberal notion."<P>
The Knoxville church takes the Bible as central to its faith, though Richardson says church members do not tend to be literalists.<P>
"We try to come to some sort of understanding of what Jesus was about, what he cared about, what he insisted on. And we see a need for the church to carry on in that fashion.<P>
"When Jesus was angry, he was angry at the church. He was not a judging person. He was open to the needs of the world--the poor, the hungry, the outcast. That's what the church's job is--to pay attention to those needs."<P>
<H3>A HOTBED IN EAST TENNESSEE</H3>
<P>
When compared with the large numbers of Baptist, Methodist and Presbyterian churches, the Unitarian Universalists' three churches here look insignificant. But on a national scale, the three congregations make the Knoxville metropolitan area a hotbed of Unitarian Universalism. While the country boasts less than a quarter million Unitarian Universalists, the Knoxville area has three churches, with sister congregations in Kingsport and Chattanooga.<P>
Two of those Unitarian congregations date from mid-century. Both Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church in Knoxville and the Oak Ridge Unitarian Universalist Church were founded shortly after World War II. The third church, Westside Unitarian Universalist, was formed over a decade ago when the first two churches decided to support the formation of a third congregation rather than constructing larger buildings.<P>
Ironically, the liberal Unitarians share a common ancestor with their more conservative Baptist brethren; that irascible liberal, Roger Williams, who founded Rhode Island to preserve freedom of conscience, is a forebear of both groups. Like the Quakers and the United Church of Christ, UUs (as they call themselves) are noncredal. The denomination honors the individual pursuit of religious insight wherever it may take the seeker, even if that means the denial of religion.<P>
The practical result has been that Unitarian Universalists, both locally and nationally, have welcomed Christians of many persuasions, as well as humanists, Jews, non-Christians and even atheists. Predictably, the UU approach to Scripture varies with the individual, though it's a fairly safe bet that few are literalists.<P>
The Rev. Lynn Thomas Strauss, the minister at Tennessee Valley, says that Unitarian Universalism is popular here because East Tennesseans, more than residents of other regions, expect to be part of a church.<P>
"Many are unchurched in other places because church identity is not so important there," Strauss speculates. "People who wouldn't go to church elsewhere go here because it's expected of them."<P>
She also says that liberal families want their children to experience other children and families who share their values. "There are also fewer liberal options in the Knox County area than there are in other metropolitan areas. The public schools tend to take their character from the majority, and around here that's largely moderate to conservative."<P>
The unifying factor for many Unitarian Universalists has been social action. Knoxville Unitarians were active in the civil rights struggle of the '60s, as well as later peace, justice and environmental movements. Like most of the other churches mentioned in this story, the Unitarians support KIN, the Knoxville Interfaith Network, which aims at progressive social change in the area.<P>
<H3>KEEPING UP WITH THE BIG GUYS</H3>
<P>
Liberal expressions of the Christian faith are not limited to small churches or denominations that have a historical commitment to individual conscience. There are liberal emphases in many Knoxville churches from the mainline denominations.<P>
At Church Street United Methodist Church, it's evident in the soup kitchen the congregation runs on one of the building's lower level, as well as in the informal community worship service the church offers homeless people on Thursday nights.<P>
"We don't see the world in black and white. We see a lot of gray," says the Rev. Laura Rasor, Church Street associate minister. "All of us are trying our best to live in community."<P>
Church Street supports three missionary teams (two international, one local), the Appalachian Service Project, and Wesley House, a community center in Lonsdale, as well as other community agencies that help people in crisis. The church is involved with an interfaith group that is planning a workshop to train church leaders in dealing with AIDS issues.<P>
These efforts are a part of what Rasor sees as the church's mission: "We strongly believe that God has created all of us and has special calls and cares for all of us," she says.<P>
For Rasor, a literal approach to Scripture is too limited.<P>
"We have to have an openness, a willingness to listen to the multitude of ways God speaks today," she says. "I use Scripture as a living book, written a long time ago, which comes to life when it is interpreted and proclaimed in a community of faith.<P>
"The word it speaks today may be different from the context in which it was written. We have to allow it to speak to us today."<P>
For Father Terry Ryan, priest at John XXIII Catholic Center at the University of Tennessee, the primary issue is openness and acceptance, not the literal truth of the Bible.<P>
"The Bible was written in a certain historical period," he says. "It's the word of God, inspired, but you get crazy when you try to hold on to the literal meaning."<P>
Ryan ministers to more than 400 UT students and about 230 resident families that make the Catholic Center their spiritual home. His congregation is involved in Habitat for Humanity projects to house the working poor and also works in a canned food drive to help feed the hungry.<P>
"Christian forgiveness and acceptance are available to all strata of people in society," he says. "We don't reject homosexuals. We have to have an openness to people in the situations in which they find themselves."<P>
He notes that the Catholic Church opposes abortion and premarital sex but says the central message is about the Gospel.<P>
"We challenge people to live out the Gospel. If one has somehow not lived up to the challenge, there is forgiveness and an opportunity for reconciliation. There's no shunning.<P>
"We're trying to carry the good news to those who really feel they have had a struggle," Ryan says. "If you think you're perfect, what's the good news?"<P>
One of Ryan's parishioners is Marilyn Jacobson, who is active in the Ladies of Charity Association, which was begun by Knoxville Catholics. For her, Christianity is about helping people.<P>
Recently recognized with an award from the National Conference (formerly the National Conference of Christians and Jews), Jacobson has been active with the Ladies of Charity and served on the Knox school board. She expresses amazement at the need in Knoxville for the services of the Ladies of Charity, noting that the number of people helped by the agency has recently jumped from 100 a week to 200 a week.<P>
"You become aware of how good life has been for you," she says. "You want to share whatever way you can with people who have not been so fortunate."<P>
Ecumenical work with other churches and other faiths is also important at John XXIII. In fact, many of the clergy and congregations in this article interact in both spiritual and charitable activities.<P>
"We're trying to see the ways in which we have common interests and share the best of what we are," Ryan says.<P>
<H3>ANXIOUS MOMENTS</H3>
<P>
Being religiously liberal has its drawbacks in Knoxville, or at least its anxious moments.<P>
None of the Southern Baptist ministers contacted wanted to be identified as liberal or progressive. Given the moderate-vs.-conservative controversies that have shaken and virtually split the Southern Baptist Convention over the last decade and a half, the term liberal has become like a political death sentence for many of the Baptist faith.<P>
One Baptist preacher from a prominent area church refused to talk in terms of liberal and conservative, noting that his church had been unfairly labeled liberal. He did indicate that he and some other Baptists look on the Bible as "inspired of God and the richest resource of our understanding of God."<P>
"The Bible is not revealed science," he continues. "It's not about facts. It is about the revealed person of God. The authority of the Bible and the inspiration of God is the source of our faith and practice.<P>
"I take a dynamic view of inspiration rather than a literal view of inspiration."<P>
That carefully worded statement does not classify the Bible as inerrant or as literally true, two things that fundamentalists insist upon. The minister describes a true liberal as one who "says the Bible is not any different from any other book and denies the authority of Scripture and the deity of Christ."<P>
Other religious people who are more open to the progressive label still find liberal a less than comfortable fit.<P>
"Biblical criticism has its place, but doing what I do in church, I don't think my congregation has much interest," says the Rev. Mike Askew, who pastors Shiloh Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) on Biddle Street. "When I was in seminary, I had to pay attention to it. Some of it was very valid."<P>
Askew says his congregation takes the Bible as "the authoritative word of God, without error or flaw." The 86 members of his congregation are active in a wide range of outreach, including tutoring programs and working with senior citizens.<P>
"Sometimes it's fearful to talk of liberal and progressive, because there is such a strong fundamentalist group in the area," says the Rev. Paige Buccholz, who is vicar of St. Luke's Episcopal Church in East Knoxville. "When I look at the Inner City Church (which arsonists burned in January), I find it scary to speak out in this community for things such as better race relations or improved housing and transportation."<P>
St. Luke's is a mission church of the Episcopal Diocese of East Tennessee and has had a predominantly African-American membership, though in the four and a half years Buccholz has been at the church, the number of white families has increased.<P>
"We have a range as far as theology goes," Buccholz says. "I would not say the majority would call themselves liberal, and there's a diversity of opinion on Scriptures. But at least one thing agreed upon is the question of human rights--we're in favor of increased civil rights for everyone."<P>
For Buccholz, being religious means one thing, whether it's called liberal or some other label: "If people are going to say they are Christian or religious in any sense, they have to live out Jesus' message to love one another and not to judge one another."

Going for the Glory</H1>
<P><STRONG>Gloria Ray strives to bring athletic fame to Knoxville</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Betty Bean</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>

The year she turned 13, Gloria Ray's family doctor told her it was time to give up football. She suspected his motives.<P>
"I just thought it was because his son was the backup quarterback to me, and if I'd quit he'd get to play first string," she remembers.<P>
But the doctor didn't say she couldn't play tennis, and by the time she graduated from Fulton High in 1965, she'd won a state doubles championship. She also had a chest full of medals for baton twirling.<P>
And once a year she'd play basketball in the annual YWCA tournament. (Knoxville's city school system didn't allow girls' basketball, not even the half-court game customary in those times. Playing basketball was believed by some to scramble female reproductive parts and render girls sterile.)<P>
Some kids thought the Y games were just for fun. Not Gloria Ray, who remembers playing her butt off.<P>
"I always figured if they kept score, it must matter," she says.
<H3> </H3>
The county clerk is keeping score at the March 1996 County Commission meeting, and it matters a lot to Ray, who as president and chief executive officer of the Knoxville Sports Corporation has jumped all the committee hurdles and written up a brief, condensed executive summary explaining that her project "will be the mirror and memory of women's basketball."<P>
She has spoon-fed the commissioners every drop of information they need to understand why Knox County should lend its full faith and credit to the Sports Corporation's quest to bring the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame to Knoxville.<P>
Is she nervous?<P>
"Nah," she says--because she isn't asking to pick the taxpayer's pocket. What she's asking for is for the county to "enhance the credit of the Sports Corporation"--to the tune of the $6.2 million needed to build the Hall of Fame.<P>
The Sports Corporation, a coalition of local government and private businesses, is four years old and works to bring income-generating sporting events to Knoxville. It receives a large chunk of its annual operating budget from Knox County Commission. In return, according to Ray's reckoning, it has brought in $35 million in tourist spending. <P>
A peerless shmoozer, Ray sweetens the dry numbers of her financial projections with a big dose of her considerable charm. She admits to wincing a little recently when Knox County Finance Director Kathy Hamilton told a reporter that the county would be liable for the money if the Sports Corporation isn't able to pay off the $6.2 million. She says she would have put it differently, though she admires Hamilton's candor.<P>
Personal relationships can be the key to success, and she has those aplenty. She is on County Commission's greens committee for the county golf course and serves on the gender equity task force for the county schools.<P>
She is a dark-haired, pug-nosed, fast-moving, joke-cracking spark plug who claims to stand five-foot-four. She is, in common parlance, a pistol. Active in sports at the age of 40-something, she has played golf with many of the commissioners, and she is good. Has she ever been tempted to let one of them beat her so he won't feel badly about getting whipped by a woman?<P>
"That would be disrespectful," she says, somewhat disdainfully. "I don't think I have ever thrown a game. If we're playing golf I'm going to try to beat you."<P>
Frank Leuthold, arguably the most powerful commissioner and chairman of the Finance Committee, can't help but grin when her name is mentioned. They have a long-running private joke about left-handed bowling balls.<P>
She downplays the effects of her ebullient personality on the county legislators. It's mostly a matter of conveying the facts, she says: "Get 'em the right information and they'll make the right decision."<P>
Maybe. But make no mistake: Gloria Ray is a perpetual motion machine who could sell flotation devices to mermaids.<P>
Like any good lobbyist, she has her votes counted and knows she's got way more than the requisite 10, the magic number she needs to keep the deal alive. But she grudgingly admits she's just a little worried. There is one commissioner she can't read.<P>
"I just can't seem to connect with him," she frets. "I just don't know..."<P>
During the meeting, Ray sits quietly in the audience. She doesn't push. Finally, her deal comes up on the agenda, and wham-bam, thank you ma'am, it's an 18-1 vote her way.<P>
She is uncannily correct in her earlier assessment. The lone dissenting vote is that of Mark Cawood, the commissioner of whom she was unsure. <P>
She hangs around until the next break so she can thank everybody but Cawood for the vote that will allow her to head out to Charlotte armed with the promise that the county will enhance the Sports Corporation's credit. Now she's got the most important piece of the deal, the piece she needed to give her a strong hand in nose-to-nose negotiations with the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame board, which is meeting in the Queen City just before the tip-off of the women's NCAA Final Four.<P>
When she gets back to Knoxville the following week, she'll tackle the task of securing the site: a parcel of land on the east side of downtown near the Hyatt Hotel. Its current owner is mega-rich industrialist Pete DeBusk, whom she'll be taking to breakfast one day soon.
<H3> </H3>
Ray isn't so busy landing the deal that she isn't paying attention to what's on TV. And what's on this last week of March, as far as she and lots of other Knoxvillians are concerned, is the University of Tennessee's women's basketball team, in the process of burning its way through regional playoff opponents and into the Final Four.<P>
The Lady Vols rule. <P>
It's quite natural that she should have more than an average fan's interest in the games. She was there in the beginning, as UT's first women's athletic director, hired away in 1977 from Mississippi College for Women where she coached tennis and basketball. She held the job until 1984, and is commonly credited with laying the foundation for what is now one of the premier women's athletics programs in the country. She has an undergraduate degree from East Tennessee State University, a master's from UT.<P>
It was Ray who long ago named the Lady Volunteers, and it was Ray who persuaded Pat Head, a 22-year-old part-time coach and graduate assistant who'd just about decided to move on to a place where they took women's athletics seriously that Tennessee was fixing to do just that.<P>
"I told Pat, 'You need to stay around and see if things aren't different,'" Ray says. "That's not to say that the people who came before me couldn't have done it, but the university gave me the structure to grow."<P>
Ray counts Pat Head Summitt, who sits on the Sports Corporation's board of directors, as "a dear friend," but she says the relationship was not without its sharp edges. Peculiar things can happen when two fierce competitors take road trips together.<P>
Like the time Ray and Summitt rode together to Sneedville for a banquet in a high school gymnasium and got into an argument over what they'd probably have for dinner. Summitt said ham, Ray said roast beef. The discussion grew so heated that they drew up a chart predicting the whole meal: entree, vegetable, drink and dessert. Their hosts were there to greet them when they arrived, and Ray laughs when she recalls what happened.<P>
"We both jumped out of the car and yelled 'What's for dinner?' They must have thought we hadn't eaten in days." <P>
Though a storied name among fans of women's basketball, Lady Vols isn't a '90s kind of moniker. And Ray, who was women's A.D. from 1977 to 1984, sometimes catches heat for choosing it.<P>
UT women's track coach Dorothy Doolittle, for example, has spurned the name, opting instead to call her team the Tennessee Women's Track Team. Vanderbilt's women's basketball team has dropped Lady from its name, becoming simply the Commodores. The University of Southern California's women's team is called the Women of Troy, rather than the Lady Trojans.<P>
"I have people ask me if the men's team should be called the Gentleman Vols," Ray says. But she believes critics need to understand the context of the times.<P>
"Our credibility was key, and our concern was if we didn't give ourselves a name, someone else was going to do it for us."<P>
She remembers that the late Tom Siler, longtime News-Sentinel sports editor, was encouraging fans to name the team. "Orange Maids," "Volettes" and "Vols Dolls" were a few examples.<P>
She was afraid he was going to run a contest, the results of which could be mortifying.<P>
"If I hadn't come up with Lady Vols, they were going to come up with something else. I felt women's teams needed their own identity, and I think the Lady Vols have stood well through time." (Tennessee wasn't the only venue for this sort of thing. Women at the University of Nebraska were in danger of being dubbed the "Niblets.")
<H3> </H3>
UT was spending $126,000 a year on women's athletics in those days, and women were playing basketball in Alumni Gym at 2 p.m. with nobody watching. When Ray was interviewed for the UT job, there was a plan in place to "improve" things by hiring coaches who would spend 90 percent of their time teaching physical education.  <P>
Ray told the search committee that the plan wouldn't cut it. For starters, they needed to spend most of their money on salaries.<P>
She faced stiff resistance from traditional Vols fans who were afraid there was a finite amount of support for team sports, and that boosting women's sports would diminish opportunities for men. There were also those who just plain didn't believe women could play. (These dinosaurs still exist. They quote Bobby Knight, who is on record saying "There are two things that should be done in the dark: sex and women's basketball.")<P>
So Ray, charged with overseeing compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws, was forced to walk that thin line between pushing for her program and not offending or threatening men, a task perhaps suited to a majorette/football player.<P>
Pay Pat Head enough to keep her, Ray insisted, and make her a full-time coach.<P>
"The world was beginning to change, and my position was that we needed  to be pioneers," she says. "And if you accept a leadership role, you have to be willing to accept the bloody nose that can come with it. Tennessee really became a leader in terms of commitment to women's athletics, funding sources and structure."<P>
By the end of Ray's tenure, the budget for women's athletics was $1.2 million, the women's track team had won a national championship, and Pat Head Summitt was on her way to becoming the John Wooden of women's basketball.<P>
Ray says she enjoys the challenge of breaking uncharted ground more than that of maintaining an empire, and decided it was time to move on. She's never far away, though, and every year she attends a banquet where the year's top player gets the Gloria Ray Leadership Award, something of which she is very proud.<P>
"I get to sit there and listen to what they say about me--it's kind of like attending my own funeral," Ray says.
<H3> </H3>
Buck Vaughan is the Sports Corporation's vice-chairman. He, chairman Bill Stokely and co-vice chairman Hank Bertlekamp form the troika which founded the Sports Corporation and is still the backbone of the board of directors. The organization was born of an abortive effort to bring the '92 Olympic track and field trials here. Knoxville made a credible showing, but lost out to New Orleans.  <P>
"It hit me square between the eyes that everybody else involved had some sort of authority," Vaughan says. "We had just raised our funds by getting on the phone and collecting a couple of million in pledges.<P>
"So I got back home, got together with a group. And we decided what we were going to have to do if we wanted in the big leagues was have an organization. Al Treadaway (who heads the convention center) said we needed to look at a sports authority.<P>
"So we decided it ought to be an independent, non-profit organization. We chartered it, opened it up and raised money to fund it for three years. We got to looking for the right person to head it. I always thought the right person was Gloria, who is an aggressive, absolutely excellent businesswoman. That little girl is a ball of fire, and it wouldn't be near the success it is without her."<P>
Inspired by the pioneering efforts that built Indianapolis into a national sports center, these days most every city of any size has a sports corporation. The competition for events is tough, and in this seller's market not every effort pans out. A delegation dispatched to negotiate for the Olympic Festival came home resolved that the price tag was too high. Area fans didn't turn out as anticipated for the USA Track and Field championships, and events like bowling tournaments and regattas don't generate much excitement or revenue.<P>
The AAU Junior Olympics attracted thousands to Knoxville in 1993, and the Sports Corporation had great success with the 1992 US Gymnastics Classics. Phil Savage, who along with his wife Lisa owns and operates the Knoxville Gymnastics Training Center, credits Ray with some incredibly smooth moves in running the event.<P>
"It was a coup de grace," Savage says. "Gloria does things right. For example, compulsory sessions are not generally well attended, but Gloria had the place packed here. The gymnasts walked in and found a gym full of people. Gloria had made it an official school holiday, coordinated all the schools in Knox County, and had kids bussed over in two-hour cycles."<P>
He says Ray also eliminated the chronic problem of coaches bugging score-keepers to keep them constantly updated on their kids' scores.<P>
"She stationed state troopers to guard the computer table. Nobody could come near," Savage says. "It was great. And because of the things she did, Gloria was able to land the USA Championships--one of the most important events in gymnastics, and our best chance to see Olympic caliber kids here in our back door."<P>
The Women's Basketball Hall of Fame would be KSC's first permanent, ongoing project, and the first and only free-standing structure dedicated to the women's game. Ray pitches it as a future focal point for boosters of women's athletics. One paragraph in the executive summary she wrote about the Hall of Fame makes a strong, succinct pitch for locating it here:<P>
"No state is as crazy about girls' and women's basketball as Tennessee. The University of Tennessee has been to NCAA championships 12 times in 20 years, and has won three (make that four) NCAA titles between 1987 and 1991 (make that 1996). There have been two Tennessee Division I teams in the Top 10 all year, four in the Top 50. There are three Tennessee teams in the NCAA Top 10. Furthermore, there has consistently been a Tennessee high school in the Top 25 high school teams in the nation."<P>
Contrary to the natural assumption that her Lady Vols connections were helpful in the Hall of Fame negotiations, Ray says they have been a mixed blessing.<P>
"You've got people sitting on (the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame) board who are coaches, business people, college administrators, an ESPN announcer--and they do not want to see it become the University of Tennessee Hall of Fame," she says.<P>
"I'm not so sure some coaches sitting on that board didn't think it would give Pat an unfair recruiting edge."<P>
Knoxville became a contender for the Hall of Fame rather suddenly. Plans to build it in Jackson, Tenn., stalled out, and the Hall of Fame board had been made an offer by the Naismith Foundation in Springfield, Mass., which proposed to build a "women's wing" onto the structure where the men's hall of fame is housed.<P>
Ray knew the Jackson effort was floundering, and hatched the idea of getting into the hunt for the Hall of Fame when she "became aware they weren't moving at the pace they wanted. I called them out of the blue in October and asked for a meeting with their executive committee."<P>
The committee sneaked into town during the season-opening Tip-Off Classic, and Ray presented them with a Request to Proceed. The whole thing was operating very much on the QT.<P>
"I didn't want anyone to know I was doing it." says Ray. "These people were coming in and out of town and no one knew. We were showing them sites and sharing financial data. I came up with a final presentation to make in Charlotte. There were several days I spent with accountants, and they were not pleasant days."<P>
She says it was not only a matter of the Hall of Fame board choosing Knoxville; the Sports Corporation had requirements of the Hall of Fame board, as well:<P>
All induction dinners, camps, workshops and fund-raisers will be held in Knoxville. The Sports Corporation will have the right to use the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame name for events, and there will be one locally controlled interactive exhibit for young children.<P>
This, says Ray, will broaden the base of participation in the Hall, give kids a sense of ownership, and be a great data-collecting device to boot.<P>
As evidenced by the County Commission vote, the project enjoys widespread community support, and detractors are hard to find. One naysayer, however, is the Halls Shopper, which recently declared that "Ray promotes sporting events that we didn't even know we wanted to see, such as the 'Amazing Anorexic Acrobats from the Amazon' and the 'Nimble Nearly Neurotic Pneumatics from New Zealand.'"<P>
Shopper publisher Sandra Clark suggested that County Commission should have opted to send Ray a valentine instead of voting to guarantee the $6.2 million:<P>
"Roses are red, violets are blue; we wish you good luck, but we'll keep our $6.2."
<H3> </H3>
Ray's parents are Elsie and Bill Ray, and she has a brother, Danny, who now lives in Memphis. In the early years, Elsie was a widow who struggled to make sure her children didn't miss a single opportunity. When Gloria was 12, Elsie and Bill married. Danny was best man, Gloria best woman. She says she couldn't have had a happier home.<P>
The family attended Broadway Baptist Church, and the athletic Gloria channeled her energies into Claudette's Majorettes (led by world-famous UT twirler Claudette Riley).<P>
"It was a neat way to grow up," she says.  <P>
She believes that living in her home town has helped with her business relationships. She went to high school with the guy who parks cars in the lot on the corner of Cumberland and Gay. Carolyn Jensen ran the basketball tournaments at the Y. And everybody knows her name at Regas.<P>
When she speaks publicly, which is often, she talks about the power of those relationships.<P>
"It's much easier to do business with friends," she says.<P>
She also speaks with conviction about the special qualities of her home town. One of her favorite stories is about the family of a young gymnast who was here in 1992. They stopped a stranger downtown to ask directions to a Kingston Pike restaurant, and, instead of telling them how to get there, he got in his car and took them.<P>
"That story went all over the country," Ray says. "Where else could that happen?"<P>
As Phil Savage pointed out, the success of the '92 gymnastics event opened the door to something even bigger--the USA Gymnastics National Championships. Ray laughs when she talks about the stops she pulled out get them here, admitting that she took note when one USA Gymnastics official called gymnasts hams who appreciate the kind of attention they got here.<P>
"Lord, we sent country ham to those people," she says. Attached to the ham was the following note: "We'll bring the crowds; you bring the ham. We just hope it's Tennessee country ham."<P>
The down-home ploy worked, and the contracts were signed. But there was a hitch.<P>
"They came back and said 'We're going to have to move that date," Ray says. "This meant we had to move a convention of 15,000 home schoolers, six high school graduations, UT summer school registration and two summer camps.<P>
"So I told them 'No problem.' I believe if people sincerely understand, they'll help."<P>
Then NBC-TV came back with another request.<P>
Could they change the dates again?<P>
Ray called the network.<P>
"'What's the problem?' I asked.<P>
"'The French Open.'<P>
"'Could they  move?' "<P>
They couldn't, so Ray had to ask the graduating seniors, the home schoolers, the UT folks and the summer campers to move their events yet again. And they did.<P>
"No other community in the United States that would do that," Ray says.
<H3> </H3>
There's a paperweight on Ray's desk bearing the slogan "If you are not the lead dog the view never changes." Lead Dog is one of her nicknames.<P>
And, not unlike many of Knoxville's top businessmen, she has parlayed a background of participation in sports into a career. Leadership is one of the things she says she has learned from sports, and she cites statistics showing that a majority of successful women have participated in team sports at some time in their lives.<P>
"There are advantages men have in business that come from playing sports," she says. "You don't hate who you are playing. You just want to make sure you're playing better than they are. And you build discipline, self-confidence, sacrifice and hard work."<P>
She has been moved by the "If you let me play sports" Nike television commercial. It shows a series of young girls saying "If you let me play sports ... I will learn what it is to be strong; like myself better; be 60 percent less likely to get breast cancer; be more likely to leave a man who beats me; be less likely to get pregnant before I want to..."<P>
"Now," says Ray, "there's a whole new generation of young girls having the same experiences as boys. I was a pioneer. But the little girls playing sports now, they're a different breed."

<STRONG>Every year it happens</STRONG> just as it did the year before. March
looms
closer and closer, and with it our "Best of Knoxville" readers' poll. Teeth
gritted, shoulders squared, we confidently plan for it. This year, we vow
to ourselves, we'll figure it out so thoroughly, it'll be hardly any effort
at all. This means jury-rigged ballot-counting software. Eagle-eyed sentinels
on the lookout for stuffing. Legions of weak-fingered, data-entering staff
members dazedly staring at computer screens. "Count the ballots!" goes the
cry. "Count the ballots or die!" Still, we run out of time, racing against
the clock, slamming it all together just before we go to press. And so here
you have it: our annual compendium of who and what Knoxvillians love the
most. Wait until next year.

<H2><HR><A NAME=goods>GOODS AND SERVICES</A><HR>
</H2><H2>Best Comics Shop
</H2><P><STRONG>Collector's Choice</STRONG>
<P>With perennial winner Ziggy's Comics undergoing a buyout, name-change
and relocation, this longtime Strip fixture ascended the comics throne. And
it's not hard to see why--from action figures to role-playing games to all
the latest in comics and graphic novels, Collector's Choice has the goods
to give Knoxville's comics freaks and sci-fi geeks their fantasy fix.
<H2>Best Shoe Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Rack Room Shoes</STRONG>
<P>Oh, the smell of leather. Rack Room's got a lot of it...in every form
of sneaker, sandal, and slingback known to man. Their selection is superb.
Plus, if you're drooling on a sleek Maripe loafer that's way out of your
budget (even with Rack Room's low prices), the chances are pretty good they'll
have a lower-cost version not far down the aisle.
<H2>Best Thrift Store
</H2><P><STRONG>AmVets</STRONG>
<P>The granddaddy of Knoxville thrift stores, AmVets is the first-stop must
for thriftaholics on their weekly tour. Need a pair of two-dollar Levi's,
a sweater for 98 cents, a couch for 11 bucks? Dying for a camel coat (with
or without fur collar), a la Catherine Deneuve in Belle de Jour? AmVets is
the place. Holidays mean half-price sales, and you can't swing a dead cat
without hitting a hipster. True, you have to be willing to search for the
real treasures, but the expansive inventory is a virtual guarantee you'll
find something.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Goodwill, Salvation Army
<H2>Best Furniture Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Fowler's Furniture Center</STRONG>
<P>Ray Charles the Robot is still around, but he and his piano are shrouded
now in gold lam&eacute;, and you won't notice him as you enter Knoxville's
favorite furniture store. Ray isn't working at the moment, but Fowler's staff
has decorated around him with a scenario illustrating the current sales theme
("Back to the Future '96") that includes a female mannequin in a Christopher
Lloyd-style fright wig and white lab coat. Ray may be between sets, but acres
of showy living room, dining room and bedroom furniture remain. Fowler's
decorators haven't lost their sense of humor: On one upholstered piece, a
bottle of Gerber's baby food sits spilled--a shocker till you notice that
the pooling yellow puree is plastic.
<H2>Best Hair Salon
</H2><P><STRONG>Salon Visage</STRONG>
<P>We don't know what the name means, but we do know what this establishment
gives its customers--style, high fashion and the excitement of celebrity
connections (not to mention good haircuts). That's why it has retained its
top spot among our readers. Salon Visage has two locations, with a third
in the works near campus to foof the 'dos of coif-needy UT students.
<H2>Best Sporting Goods Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Knoxville Sports </STRONG>
<P>Bowling balls, badminton birdies, barbells, boxing gloves--if it has anything
to do with sports, you'll probably find it at this warehouse-sized store
in the Windsor Square shopping center. With prices and selection suited to
hardcore jocks and weekend warriors alike, Knoxville Sports stands head and
muscular shoulders above the competition.
<H2>Best Computer Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Eastern Computer </STRONG>
<P>Macs rock. Surely there can be no doubt about that. Why, the very magazine
you're holding in your hands was produced on a Mac. And where does one go
to get Macs but Eastern Computer? Sure, they also sell those IBM PC whatzits,
but Macs will always have a home (and a repair center) at Eastern. If RAM-envy
is the disease of the '90s, then the kindly folks at Eastern have the cure.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Circuit City, Office Depot
<H2>Best New Books Book Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Bookstar</STRONG>
<P>Once again, the titan of the west conquers all. They aren't the biggest
bookstore (the sheer mass of Books-a-Million probably grabs that honor),
and they aren't the choosiest in their selection (the book gourmands of
Davis-Kidd snag that). But they do offer an impressive combination of both
attributes, along with the most expansive and fun magazine rack in town.
And let's not forget that across-the-board hardcover discount.
<H2>Best Used Book Store
</H2><P><STRONG>McKay's Used Books</STRONG>
<P>Granted, the field of competition for this category is not large. But
more used book stores in Knoxville probably wouldn't threaten McKay's standing.
The selection is vast, to the point where it could just as easily be measured
in acreage as it could in the number of titles shelved. The service is
superlative by necessity, as their filing system is NASA-precise ("I'm sorry,
did you say 'Historical Novel' or 'Biographical Fiction?'"). And the new
locale suits the stacks just fine, with the also amply stocked compact disc-ery
finally under the same roof. What a wonderful world it would be if all steak
houses matured, like butterfly larvae, to become sizable used book stores.
<H2>Best CD Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Disc Exchange</STRONG>
<P>Sprawling shelves of low-priced new and used discs, now in two locations.
Where else but the Disc Exchange? And the ample selection isn't confined
to standard rock and country fare--both stores have healthy stocks of jazz,
blues, bluegrass, hip-hop, classical and New Age, as well as the latest in
indie cool. All this and posters, boxed sets, magazines, and the city's first
(and still best) listening bar. We dare you to walk in without walking out
with an enticingly priced new release or some unearthed eight-dollar gem.
<H2>Best Vinyl Record Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Lost &amp; Found</STRONG>
<P>Although a few of our readers are of the opinion that vinyl is dead--and
things admittedly are looking pretty bleak what with the closing of Landspeed
Records (see Best New Business)--Lost &amp; Found proves that, at the very
least, used vinyl is booming. The past year saw owners Mike and Maria Armstrong
expand the West Knoxville store to nearly twice its original size, without
losing any of its cozy, attic-like ambiance. Bursting at the seams with an
ever-changing stock of oldies but goodies, Lost &amp; Found has also increased
its inventory of alterna-hip releases and T-shirts, as well as used CDs and
cassettes. And we've got to give them much-deserved props for their championing
of the local music scene.
<EM>Close Runner Up:</EM> Landspeed Records
<H2>Best Musical Instruments Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Pick 'N' Grin</STRONG>
<P>With the flat-out best selection of used and vintage instruments in these
parts, it's no surprise that Pick 'N' Grin is the favorite. There's just
something about old wood which also makes music that makes a person feel
good all over. (If you haven't seen it already, stop by and check out the
sunburst Fender Starcaster they've got now. They just don't make them like
that anymore.) And for local pickers with old instruments, Pick 'N' Grin's
service department is like the family doctor.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Broadway Sound, Rob Payne Music Center
<H2>Best Video Rental Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Gemstone</STRONG>
<P>A clean, well-lighted place that somehow maintains security without making
you feel like a cow in a slaughterhouse. Convenience, a liberal selection,
a peppy staff, and three locations on Kingston Pike make Gemstone Knoxville's
once and current favorite video store.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Blockbuster, Evil Eye Video
<H2>Best Liquor Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Ashe's</STRONG>
<P>Once your mom comes to terms with the fact that you're old enough to drink
and that you enjoy it, she'll find comfort in the fact that, well, at least
you shop at Ashe's. As soon as you pass through those doors, you're treated
like a member of the Cox family. Whether you're looking for wine by the box
or one of those grand bottles older than the lads behind the counter, you'll
be counseled and guided as if you were shopping for a little something to
bring to dinner on the salesperson's patio tomorrow night, say, eight-ish.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> McScrooge's, Bob's
<H2>Best Pet Store
</H2><P><STRONG>SuperPetz</STRONG>
<P>Stretching out in the shell of a former grocery store, SuperPetz lives
up to its name with aisles and aisles of food, litter, toys, collars, brushes,
bowls, beds and every other pet accessory and accouterment you can imagine.
Basically, anything you might ever need or want for Fido, Fluffy, or even
a ferret is here. In fact, if you might need or want a ferret or a water
dragon or Siberian dwarf hamster, this is the place to go, too. SuperPetz
carries a large variety of reptiles and amphibians, birds, fish, rabbits,
rodents and more. And be sure to say hi to Zak, the store's four-foot-long
pet iguana. There's probably nothing here you haven't seen before, but the
sheer volume makes SuperPetz your one-stop pet shopping bonanza.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Adopt-A-Pet, Pet Patch, Pass Pets
<H2>Best Newsstand
</H2><P><STRONG>Chelsea Station</STRONG>
<P>Some bookstores in town may have a bigger selection of newspapers and
magazines, but Knoxville's favorite newsstand is Knoxville's only pure newsstand.
(We're big enough for at least one now--aren't we?) Approximately 3,000 miles
from Chelsea, but mere seconds away from the epicenter of the Old City, Chelsea
Station is convenient to late lurkers and coffee drinkers in need of a read.
<EM>Close Runner Up:</EM> Bookstar
<H2>Best Electronics Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Circuit City</STRONG>
<P>Not only is Circuit City Knoxville's Best Electronics Store, according
to our readers, it's the everything-est; the biggest, the loudest, the
flourescent-est, the most aggressive-est, you name it. The industrial
pallet-stacks of gear coupled with carnival-like bombardment of the senses
is made up for by the guys on the floor, however. They can tell you all you'd
ever want to know about integrated remotes, fiber optic capability, RAM doublers,
wireless headsets, and anything else that might need an extension cord or
batteries. Including why you need them.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Radio Shack, NOW
<H2>Best Health Food Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Nature's Pantry</STRONG>
<P>Whatever it takes to get the good stuff on the table, right? Nature's
Pantry has done an admirable job of selling a non-mainstream line of goods
and goodies (granted, it should be mainstream) to the masses by playing the
game. It only looks like a regular grocery; inside you'll find all the amaranth,
goldenseal and organic produce your body ever dreamed of. 
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> GNC, Food Co-Op
<H2>Best Bicycle Shop
</H2><P><STRONG>Bike Zoo</STRONG>
<P>You know they've got it down when they let the mechanics tear into your
bottom bracket right out there in front of you. Everybody in the Zoo has
bought bikes, most have raced them, and the salespeople and mechanics tend
to treat folks the way they'd like to be treated themselves. A bike is pretty
much a bike and your Tour de Frank Special tends to cost the same on one
end of town as it does on the other. Aside from yard sales, about the only
bike bargains happen in the way a shop does business and how hard they work
to get you to come back. No news to the folks at the Bike Zoo. 
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> West Hills, Interwheel, Harper
<H2>Best Gift Shop
</H2><P><STRONG>Andrew Morton</STRONG>
<P>As long as folks continue to get married, Andrew Morton will continue
to flourish as a place to go for wedding presents--and gifts for other big
occasions. The finest china, crystal, silverware, etc.: it's all there--and
if it isn't, Morton can probably procure it for you.
<H2>Best Antique Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Jackson Avenue Antiques</STRONG>
<P>Jackson Avenue Antiques is so big and complex you discover a whole new
wing every time you visit. And bring your watch--you can lose track of time
here. With a liberal approach to antiques that includes everything from rare
old furniture to exotic African sculpture to '80s pop collectibles, this
Old City warehouse is always like an intriguingly weird dream.
<H2>Best Car Dealer
</H2><P><STRONG>Toyota of Knoxville</STRONG>
<P>Why do we love Toyota of Knoxville so? It may be that they're selling
one of the most reliable cars ever produced. Then again, it could be the
honest and unassuming sales folks. Or maybe it's the quick and friendly service.
But, heck, we figure it's probably the nifty neon jumpin' guy who shimmies
his way up the side of the building on a nightly basis.
<EM>Close Runner Up:</EM> Airport Honda
<H2>Best Auto Repair Shop
</H2><P><STRONG>Buckner's</STRONG>
<P>The guys in the unassuming slate gray building on Sutherland Avenue have
made all the best assumptions of how to treat you right. Head mechanics Don
Buckner and Richard  Matthews take turns giving customers personal attention,
offering a thorough (but light on the techno-speak) explanation of what's
wrong with your set of wheels, foreign or domestic. Not only will they reassure
you that they'll do your repairs as cost efficiently as possible, but they
usually finish ahead of schedule. You'll be handed their business card on
your way out, too; they know it's not easy to separate yourself from your
money so they always try to make the split as amicable as possible.
<H2>Best Men's Clothing Store
</H2><P><STRONG>M.S. McClellan</STRONG>
<P>A locally owned haberdashery with locations downtown and in Bearden,
McClellan's shows full-grown men the way to manly dignity. As you walk in
the door, you suddenly feel nobler, taller, more handsome, better mannered,
and far cooler than you did in the car. Proper!
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Structure, Common Market, AmVets
<H2>Best Women's Clothing Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Talbots</STRONG>
<P>Casual but not too casual, dressy but not too dressy, Talbots has just
the kind of clothes that are perfect for the '90s. If they were being described
in a mail-order catalog, the proper appellation would be "urban casual."
Whatever. It's the kind of stuff that makes you look great and that you can
wear for both work and play.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Dillard's, Ann Taylor, Gap
<H2>Best Hip Clothing Store
</H2><P><STRONG>Jetta's</STRONG>
<P>Congratulations, Knoxville--you've finally ventured out of the mall. Tucked
away on Gay Street's trendy 100 block, Jetta's boasts a selection of super-coolie
hipster wear, from pink vinyl pants and baggy skater duds to used go-go boots
and one-of-a-kind neckties. New and used items for both men and women cohabit
peacefully, and the vintage goods have been carefully chosen with an obviously
adoring eye. (No missing buttons, out-of-place stitches or polyester runs.)
And Jetta's is probably the only place in town where you can pick up a gold
polyester shirt emblazoned with a decal of Peter Frampton, if you should
so desire.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Gap, AmVets
<H2>Best Fitness Club
</H2><P><STRONG>Court South</STRONG>
<P>Court South rules when it comes to the survival of the fittest. Their
three locations are self-contained calorie-burning, muscle-toning malls;
like terrariums for humans. The pool and weight rooms and squash courts and
indoor track all employ fairly traditional approaches to exercise. It's the
Cardiovascular Theatre--where folks jog/ cycle/ step it off while plugged
into a bank of video stimulation--that makes you wonder if we've gone too
far.
<H2>Best New Business
</H2><P><STRONG>Landspeed Records</STRONG>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="../../dir_suncity/bok_dir/bok_newbiz.gif" WIDTH="94" HEIGHT="95" HSPACE="10">We
had planned
to write, triumphantly, about how Landspeed Records beat
the odds and the naysayers. After all, it sounded like a success story: two
twentysomethings with record store experience, knowledgeable vinyl fetishes
and unfettered enthusiasm open an indie vinyl boutique in, of all places,
downtown Knoxville. But the little-store-that-could may just have petered
out before it barely got going, due in part to local law enforcement stepping
in and putting a stop to the rock 'n' roll shows Landspeed hosted after hours.
Seems someone really does want to keep Gay Street quiet. And so 1996's Best
New Business comes to a grinding halt tomorrow, April 19. For how long, though,
we can't yet say--co-owner Lisa Morrow hints that a new, improved Landspeed
may re-open soon in a new location.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Charlie Peppers, All Night Eggplant, Blue Moon
Bakery
<H2><HR><A NAME=arts>ARTS &amp; ENTERTAINMENT</A><HR>
</H2><P>
<H2>Best Museum
</H2><P><STRONG>Knoxville Museum of Art</STRONG>
<P>Stand on the second floor of the Knoxville Museum of Art on a Friday evening,
with American Grandeur on one side of you, Julian Schnabel and "Chattering
Man" on the other, and live swing wafting up from Alive After Five--there's
not much else you need to know about the place or the people who run it.
Considering the diversity of the region the museum serves, they do a hell
of a job of filling the place, both with art and visitors.
<H2>Best Art Gallery
</H2><P><STRONG>Bennett Galleries</STRONG>
<P>For the third straight year, Knoxville art lovers love Bennett. And why
shouldn't they? The gallery carries a mighty fine roster of artists, many
of whom are local, and Marga Hayes and her staff know how to hang a room.
By this time next year, when they've crossed the Pike to the old Capri site,
Bennett Galleries will be the Space Mountain of boutiques. It's also good
to see that when Knoxvillians want to see some art, they know where to go
and patronize a broad range of sources. A-1 (all of four months old) and
the esteemed Tomato Head were popular runners-up.
<H2>Best Theater Troupe
</H2><P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="../../dir_suncity/bok_dir/bok_theatregroup.gif" WIDTH="122" HEIGHT="82" HSPACE="10"><STRONG>Clarence
Brown Company</STRONG>
<P>With stunning sets and professional actors and directors from Knoxville
and around the globe, the Clarence Brown Company leads a dozen Knoxville-area
theater companies as our Best. Named after the UT grad who became a major
MGM director and producer, CBT has used Clarence Brown's millions in inheritance
well.
<EM>Close Runner Up:</EM> Theatre Central
<H2>Best Dance Troupe
</H2><P><STRONG>Tennessee Children's </STRONG>
<P>Dance Ensemble
This troupe from an unassuming studio on Sutherland Avenue is all many people
around the world know about Knoxville--leaving folks from Japan to Norway
a graceful impression we can only hope to deserve. The city's official goodwill
ambassadors to the world are all under 17, performing an astonishing variety
of modern and classical ballet on a par with professional troupes--in fact,
TCDE is a professional troupe, and the only one of its kind in the nation.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Circle Modern Dance, City Ballet
<H2>Best Movie Theater
</H2><P><STRONG>Terrace Theater</STRONG>
<P>The word is finally out: The Terrace is a gem. Smashing all
competitors--including those ever-popular dollar theaters--the small art
house swept the honor. With its concentration on independent, art, and foreign
films, the Terrace is the only place in town to see movies you previously
could only read about. So what if they're a few months behind the national
release dates? Or that the screen is usually only two-thirds in focus? Or
that they could use a new projector bulb with a little more wattage? The
Terrace is a theater of great potential--which it could reach with more of
your support.
<H2>Best Poetry Reading Venue
</H2><P><STRONG>Manhattan's</STRONG>
<P>One of the first restaurant/bars to open in the Old City, Manhattan's
unexpectedly developed a word-of-mouth reputation for poetry slams about
three years ago. With a genuine, brick-lined improv-style atmosphere (and
a usually supportive crowd)--and, perhaps, most importantly, cold beer on
tap--Manhattan's on Tuesday night is still our favorite venue. Other places
in town are daring enough to feature open poetry readings--but we'd rather
hear the best and worst of local verse here.
<H2>Best Local Actor
</H2><P><STRONG>David Keith</STRONG>
<P>Hey--forget what we said before. David Keith is hot. Putting his
straight-to-video B-movies behind him, Keith is back in the Hollywood game,
playing with the big guys. Hot off his commendable turn in The Indian in
the Cupboard, Keith is now starring in his own cop series High Incident,
produced by none other than DreamWorks SKG (that's Spielberg-Katzenberg-Geffen).
He's looking trim and seems to be shaving more often. And there's nothing
we media weasels like more than a comeback kid.
<H2>Best Actress
</H2><P><STRONG>Patricia Neal</STRONG>
<P>Thirty years after the stroke that almost ended her career, and almost
60 years after she first walked the boards in local productions, Knoxville-raised
Patricia Neal is still our favorite. Maybe it's all her great movies now
out on video, from The Fountainhead, opposite Gary Cooper, to The Day the
Earth Stood Still opposite a killer robot from another planet. (Is that really
the same woman?) Whether she's still local, more than a half-century after
she left town, is another question. But we'll give her the benefit of the
doubt one more time. At 70, she does occasionally visit her dandy rehabilitation
center, attached to Fort Sanders Hospital.
<H2>Best Local Artist
</H2><P><STRONG>Jim Gray</STRONG>
<P>A jazz writer once tried to bait the too-hip jazzman Thelonious Monk into
belittling man of the people Lawrence Welk. Monk said simply, as if in
admiration, "The man's got a good gig." Jim Gray's got a good gig. He knows
what the people want, how to put it in a frame, and where they're going to
look for it. Hope springs eternal in artists close behind the gifted Mr.
Gray: Robert Tino, Cynthia Markert, Jan Lynch and Wade Guyton all finished
in the pack.
<H2>Best Drag Queen
</H2><P><STRONG>Shannon DeVaughn</STRONG>
<P>She's beautiful. She's blonde. She's brassy. She's a boy. Although she
departed the Carousel, that sprawling den of androgyny in Fort Sanders, for
the smaller, posher Trump's in Bearden, Knoxville's favorite gender-blending
bombshell proved once again that it's never a drag to be in drag.
<H2><HR><A NAME=people>PEOPLE</A><HR>
</H2><P>
<H2>Best Local Athlete
</H2><P><STRONG>Peyton Manning</STRONG>
<P>Let's see--the Heisman candidate quarterback on a national championship
contender... Nah, who'da thunk it? Of course, our boy Peyton isn't actually
a Knoxville native, but we can probably look the other way just this once.
Especially if he brings home that little bronze statue with the outstretched
arm.
<H2>Best Local Philanthropist
</H2><P><STRONG>Jim Haslam</STRONG>
<P>Whenever a worthy cause in town is seeking money, the path leads to James
Haslam II's doorstep. The Pilot Corp. chairman is not only one of the most
munificent men in town (along with runner-up Jim Clayton), he's also the
city's premier fund raiser. "This is Jim Haslam, and I need your help" is
a signature phone call that usually gets a signed check in response.
<H2>Best Unsung Hero
</H2><P><STRONG>Stephen Smith</STRONG>
<P>"The way I see it," says Second District Congressional candidate Dr. Stephen
Smith, "everybody has a toolbox when it comes to making a difference. Sometimes
the right tool for the job is a pen. You reach in and grab your pen and write
a letter to your congressman. Sometimes the right tool for the job is a suit.
You put on your suit and you go to Washington." Next time you see Smith,
he'll most likely be in a suit, doing his best to get you to send him to
Washington. With an impressive career in grassroots activism, the veterinarian/
environmentalist is confident that he'll make a better congressman than the
landmark he'll have to beat to become one. Readers who responded hailed Smith
as an Unsung Hero for reasons ranging from his environmental work (at the
Foundation for Global Sustainability and the Tennessee Valley Energy Reform
Coalition) and the simple fact that he's willing to represent the district
for which he so obviously cares.
<H2>Best Local Sex Symbol
</H2><P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="../../dir_suncity/bok_dir/bok_sex.gif" WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="107" HSPACE="10"><STRONG>Chuck
Hudson</STRONG>
<P>Hudson, the manager of Charlie Pepper's on the Cumberland Strip, no doubt
has his share of secret admirers who must watch as he hustles hot food, cold
drinks, staff and customers into a harmonious whole. Now, let the world
know.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<H2>Best Local Politician
</H2><P><STRONG>Victor Ashe</STRONG>
<P>Best politician (is that an oxymoron?) is, of course, none other than
Mayor Victor Ashe. Fresh off an election year where he left another opponent
to eat his dust, Ashe, who used to say he hoped he'd be the last mayor Knoxville
ever has, is heading into the year when the voters will decide whether to
grant him his alleged wish by approving consolidated government. The wily
Ashe is leaving his options open.
<H2>Best Hair Stylist
</H2><P><STRONG>Frank Gambuzza, Salon Visage</STRONG>
<P>Every town has its hairdressing star: one (usually) man who women rave
about, pledge their undying allegiance to, brave traffic and month-long waits
to get to. In Knoxville, that man is one Frank Gambuzza, owner and operator
of Salon Visage and coiffeur visionary extraordinaire. He's East Tennessee's
answer to Vidal Sassoon.
<H2>Best Waiter/Waitress
</H2><P><STRONG><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="../../dir_suncity/bok_dir/bok_waitress.gif" WIDTH="86" HEIGHT="89" HSPACE="10">Sara
Lowe, Ye Olde Steak House</STRONG>
<P>Knoxville's favorite server is Sara Lowe, who has worked at Ye Olde Steak
House for 20 years. She is fast, efficient, friendly and sold on her product.
"My cooks make me look good," she says modestly. She wouldn't eat a steak
anywhere else, and says she's crazy about the homemade desserts, especially
the chocolate ones. On the home front, she's married to that famously political
firefighter, Kenneth "Red" Lowe, who says Sara is a patient and forgiving
woman.
<H2>Best Bartender
</H2><P><STRONG>Seth Severns, Smoky Mountain Brewing Company</STRONG>
<P>Garrulous Severns, bartender for the late, lamented Smoky Mountain Brewing
Company, won in this hot contest in a crowded field in which a few votes
make a big difference. Severns tended, ardently but all too briefly, the
most extravagant bar ever built in East Tennessee. Severns's friendly honesty
about the pub's best and second-best experiments earned the respect of patrons.
Fortunately, this chemistry major diversified his career: Playing guitar
on stage with the punk 'n' roll State Champs, he's known as Johnny Turbo.
<H2>Best Local Writer
</H2><P><STRONG>Jack Neely</STRONG>
<P>Author William Styron once said (in a Metro Pulse interview, no less)
that a great writer needs a Mighty Theme. Metro Pulse's secret historian
fits the bill. Knoxvillians found resonance (and maybe a sense of identity)
in Neely's thoughtful vignettes and affably elegant prose, and he resoundingly
out-polled two-time winner Sam Venable of That Other Paper. We were going
to recommend that you pick up a copy of Knoxville's Secret History at your
local bookstore, but it looks like you already have.
<H2><HR><A NAME=places>PLACES</A><HR>
</H2><P>
<H2>Best Tourist Attraction
</H2><P><STRONG>Smoky Mountains</STRONG>
<P>Best Tourist Attraction is a difficult, almost oxymoronic, concept when
you live near those places under consideration. It's like "Shortest Tall
Guy." But hey, if enough people are convinced that tourists are coming here
to see the Smokies and leaving behind lots of dough, well, just maybe, the
governor's office will begin to look at them as a business. And then, just
maybe, it will stop generating regulations that favor smokestack polluters
over the mountains. Dare to dream.
<H2>Best Place to Watch People
</H2><P><STRONG>West Town Mall</STRONG>
<P>With the addition of about a zillion square feet full of eminently buyable
stuff, West Town Mall has truly become a retail mecca, sounding its siren
call to shoppers from Crossville to Lexington, from Chattanooga to Johnson
City. And what does that translate into but even more superb people-watching
opportunities? So get a frosty Diet Coke and a steaming hot Cinnabun, and
settle in for a good settin' spell at the food court . You'll have the finest
front row seats to East Tennessee's non-stop (well, from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.)
parade of semi-diversity.
<H2>Best Park
</H2><P><STRONG>Sequoyah Hills Park (Cherokee Boulevard)</STRONG>
<P>It's a rare case of social justice that Knoxville's most prestigious address
is also our most popular public park. On a hot Sunday afternoon, the two-mile
long Sequoyah Hills Park along Cherokee Boulevard is Knoxville's Venice Beach,
thick with volleyballers, term-paper writers, Frisbee footballers, martial
artists, walkers of retired racing dogs, and slightly tipsy golfers (hey!
watch it!). But it's still big enough to get away and sit under your own
private willow with a book of Wordsworth.
<H2>Best Bowling Alley
</H2><P><STRONG>Family Bowl</STRONG>
<P>Is there any doubt we're currently in a bowling renaissance? Sure, let
those other health-niks climb rocks and ride bicycles to Arizona; bowling
is the athletic sport of the masses. And where better to slam some pins than
at Family Bowl, which offers rockin' tunes, American beers and fine fried
potato snacks? 
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Western Plaza, Fountain Lanes
<H2>Best Golf Course
</H2><P><STRONG>Deane Hill</STRONG>
<P>Unfortunately, our readers' favorite course--newly opened to the public
last year--is no more. Now closed and awaiting redevelopment into yet more
shopping/ living space out west, Deane Hill rests unplayed upon. Can't wait
for those mini-plazas!
<H2>Best Tennis Courts
</H2><P><STRONG>Tyson Park</STRONG>
<P>LOVE ALL! That's not a tennis score; it's the dominant emotion Knoxvillians
feel for the tennis center at Tyson Park. The city courts in the shadow of
Alcoa Highway remain the city's favorite place to foot fault, rush the net,
pull off a passing shot and occasionally ace the competition.
<H2><HR><A NAME=food>FOOD &amp; DRINK</A><HR>
</H2><P>(Ed. Note: Although we asked voters to specify the location when
voting for a chain restaurant, not many did. Therefore, in order to be fair
to restaurants with only one location and lacking in million-dollar marketing
budgets, we divided total votes by the number of locations in town for each
chain.)
<H2>Best Grocery &amp; Best Bakery
</H2><P><STRONG>Fresh Market</STRONG>
<P>It's the little things that bring them back: free coffee, free pizza samples,
fresh ground sausage sculpted into the shape of its porcine source. Jesting
aside, Fresh Market is consistently well-stocked with good things that were
damn hard to get around here before they hung their shingle over the Pike.
We may now happily take imported pastas, real Belgian kreik, peppered
ch&egrave;vre and custom ground Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee for granted.

On the bakery side, things may soon heat up a bit. Open for all of one month
when these ballots were tallied, Blue Moon Bakery &amp; Cafe, on Central,
finished on the heels of Fresh Market (trailing by precisely one vote). Business
analysts are always coming off with that line about competition being good
for everybody involved--it finally seems believable when it's between two
good bakeries, one on either side of town.
<H2>Best Middle Eastern Restaurant
</H2><P><STRONG>Falafel Hut</STRONG>
<P>Falafel Hut is one of the few remaining reasons to rationalize living
in Fort Sanders. We're talking fresh and authentic Middle Eastern fare--from
your baba ganoush to tabbouleh and everything in between--at prices way better
than fair. And it's hard to beat their beer selection when it comes to washing
it all down. 
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> King Tut's, Fatoosh, Olive Tree, Dad's
<H2>Best Sports Bar
</H2><P><STRONG>Hoo-Rays</STRONG>
<P>Hugh Ray Wilson owns Knoxville's best sports bar, the eponymous Hoo-Rays.
He jokes that he, ergo the bar, acquired the name because he was born at
Baptist Hospital within earshot of Neyland Stadium, and all his mother could
hear was fans hollering "hoo-ray." Hoo-Rays features a gallery of glassy-eyed
taxidermy downstairs, a dance floor and a private club up. The memorabilia
includes an orange tuxedo in a glass case bearing the sign "In case of Sugar
Bowl break glass." Celebrity-watchers can cop glimpses of visiting sports
bigwigs, including Archie Manning on home game weekends.
<H2>Best Breakfast
</H2><P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="../../dir_suncity/bok_dir/bok_ihop.gif" WIDTH="108" HEIGHT="73" HSPACE="10"><STRONG>IHOP</STRONG>
<P>No question about it: West Knox stand-by International House of Pancakes
serves up the finest hangover helper in this town. And even sober, the grub's
pretty darn good--there's a nice variety of pancakes for all you fruits and
nuts out there, and a menu of all-American standards like grilled cheese,
sirloin patties, and rib-sticking vegetable soup. For breakfast--even if
breakfast means 2 a.m.--it simply can't be beat.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Cracker Barrel, Shoney's, Waffle House
<H2>Best Coffee,
Best Coffee House,
Best Desserts
</H2><P><STRONG>Java</STRONG>
<P>What's in a name? Java has what you need and they make it consistently
well. No fluff or distractions, aside from naturally sublime coffee drinking
settings: Central Avenue, in the Old City, and now Homberg Place, way out
west. The desserts are, simply and truly, among the best in the world. Peggy
Hambright's Mag-Pies kitchen (soon to be found on Market Square, sharing
kitchen space with Tomato Head) and local baker Judy Mixon turn out incredibly
fine sweets, from Mom's kitchen traditionals to decadent exotica.
<H2>Best Sunday Brunch
</H2><P><STRONG>Copper Cellar</STRONG>
<P>Knoxville's favorite spot for apr&egrave;s (or in lieu of) church dining
remains the Copper Cellar, where they have Sunday brunch down to a science.
From custom omelets to biscuits and gravy to smoked salmon and capers, the
Copper Cellar will satiate your every desire (and guarantee the need for
a long Sunday afternoon nap).
<H2>Best Appetizers
</H2><P><STRONG>Friday's</STRONG>
<P>One of Knoxville's finest pick-up spot also happens to serve up the best
appetizers in town--kick-ass potato skins, scrumptious chicken satay, whompin'
Oriental dumplings, etc. But as you're washing the fine fare down with a
cold one, ponder this: What exactly are they whetting your appetite for?
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Copper Cellar, Charlie Peppers, Silver Spoon,
Sunspot
<H2>Best Pizza
,Best Salads,
Best Lunch Spot
</H2><P><STRONG>Tomato Head</STRONG>
<P>Tomato Head puts more different toppings on pizza than your parents ever
wanted you to know about. Mahasti and company make Knoxville's best pizza,
no question in the minds of those who have to call for reservations on weekends.
That category wasn't even close. But with outdoor tables on a sunny day and
a newly expanded, remodeled interior that reveals the original Edwardian
stamped-tin ceiling and polished hardwood floors--plus interesting background
music and cozy first-name-basis customer service, it's also our favorite
lunch spot, edging out Sunspot by only a few votes. And in the Best Salads
category, Mater Noggin's Caesar and pasta salads --which always make you
wonder why you can't fix something that tastes that fresh at home--slipped
by Silver Spoon by exactly one vote.
<H2>Best Delivered Pizza
</H2><P><STRONG>Stefano's</STRONG>
<P>With its distinctively thick, bread-like "Chicago style" crust--and, unlike
some pizza delivery chains, no rumored political agenda--campus institution
Stefano's Pizza wins the prize.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Papa John, Pizza Hut, Domino's
<H2>Best Wings
</H2><P><STRONG>BW3</STRONG>
<P>The charms of BW3 cannot be underestimated. There's the rowdy atmosphere,
the surly bouncers, the attitudinal bartenders, the interactive trivia game,
the pool tables. Add all that to the perfect finger-licking delicious wings,
and you've got the very definition of a great bar/hangout.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Spicy's, Hooters
<H2>Best Steak House
</H2><P><STRONG>Ye Olde Steak House</STRONG>
<P>When it comes to steak, Knoxville doesn't mess around. We like our charred
flesh fresh, flavorful and straight up, please--no sissy sauces or seasoning
to detract from the visceral experience. That explains, then, why we're so
crazy about Ye Olde Steak house, a haven for steak purists on Chapman Highway.
Perhaps owing to the fine food, the brown-bagging policy, the celebratory
atmosphere, it's become a Knoxville tradition--one with compulsory post-football-
game attendance.
<H2>Best Soups
</H2><P><STRONG>The Soup Kitchen</STRONG>
<P>Concentrate on one thing, but be the very best. With a different selection
of eight soups every day, from the thick to the thin, the tomato-based to
the cream, the old standby to the slightly bizarre (not to mention great
fresh-baked bread)--plus a comfortably low-key cafeteria-style arrangement
that leaves us unpestered by waitresses and checks--longtime Market Square
landmark the Soup Kitchen won this one without a contest.
<H2>Best Deli,
Best Sandwiches
</H2><P><STRONG>Harold's</STRONG>
<P>For fatalists convinced that Gay Street is cursed, Harold's remains the
stickiest rebuttal. Postponing his retirement until further notice, Harold
Shersky has been there nearly 50 years--and as neighboring businesses wax
and wane, you're often lucky to find a seat at Harold's at lunchtime (not
to mention Saturday mornings). Our original deli remains our best, with kosher
classics and some sandwich concoctions of his own, like the pumpernickel
Reuben, the Giant Twist, and the inimitable Gilbert. It's also still a real
delicatessen (that's what deli used to stand for, kids) where you can buy
the corned beef, herring, and pickled tomatoes by the pound: the raw materials
of kosher cuisine. A meal at Harold's is the single fastest way to get to
know Knoxville at its complicated best.
<H2>Best Hamburger
</H2><P><STRONG>Litton's</STRONG>
<P>Surprise, surprise, surprise! Why--we can hardly believe it--Litton's
 won our best burger category! Who'da thunk it...well, besides EVERYBODY?
Litton's is a Knoxville original, an institution. Look up "hamburger joint"
in the American Heritage 1996 edition illustrated dictionary, and you'll
see a picture of Litton's. Really.
<H2>Best Hot Dogs
</H2><P><STRONG>"The Sabrett Vendor"</STRONG>
<P>We may not know his name, but we like him, anyway. Seemingly ubiquitous
(didn't we just see him in the Old City?) this purveyor of hot dogs that
are so good you don't call them hot dogs makes UT football games and other
occasions smell much better than they used to. (Sabrett franks is the proper
terminology for these delicately spiced sausages.) The folks at Zosha's Ukrainian
cafe near Market Square (which also serves Sabrett's and got some votes on
its own) run the Sabrett's concession. Walking around in Knoxville crowds
has never smelled and tasted so good. His name, by the way, is Vinny.
<H2>Best Barbecue
</H2><P><STRONG>Corky's</STRONG>
<P>The race was tight in the 'cue category (the choice of the masses is still
Buddy's, natch), but Corky's managed to win by a nose--or was it a snout?
Corky's tender, smoky-sweet Memphis-style ribs have earned their devoted
following. And they've become Knoxville's favorite culinary "sin."
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Calhoun's, Sarge's
<H2>Best Seafood
</H2><P><STRONG>Chesapeake's</STRONG>
<P>The completion of the "tunnel" connecting downtown to the interstate may
have turned Chesapeake's back door into its front door, but Knoxville's favorite
seafood restaurant hasn't suffered at all. From its incomparable grilled
swordfish to its signature spinach Maria, Chesapeake's still scratches the
city's itch for outstanding seafood. A comfortable ambiance with topnotch
service.
<H2>Best Buffet
</H2><P><STRONG>Mandarin House</STRONG>
<P>You know they've got the best buffet in Knoxville, because their omnipresent
billboards scream it out: "Voted Best in Knoxville!" They never bother to
say by whom, but we'll let you in on a little secret: it's none other than
Metro Pulse readers who have elevated Mandarin House to best-of status. So
next time you line up for an egg roll, tell 'em where you saw them honored.
<H2>Best Beer Selection
</H2><P><STRONG>Amsterdam Cafe</STRONG>
<P>To win this one, we think you've got to start with Guiness and Bass on
tap--two halves of the classic black-and-tan. Amsterdam has that and a whole
lot more. With a lengthy row of tasty draught flavors and more domestic and
import bottles than you can shake a frosty mug at, Amsterdam Cafe has ridden
a frothy wave of success behind that once-jinxed storefront at the corner
of Central and Jackson.
<H2>Best Wine List
</H2><P><STRONG>Orangery</STRONG>
<P>Winning by a mere vote over the always popular Naples, the Orangery retains
its prize for another year. The folks who choose the wine at the Orangery
understand that much of their clientele consider the drink to be as important
as the food, and it shows.
<H2>Best Vegetarian Menu
</H2><P><STRONG>Sunspot</STRONG>
<P>Okay, so the menu isn't strictly vegetarian. Still, Sunspot offers a wide
variety of vegetarian and vegan specialties to please the most finicky of
P.C. palates, with all-veg specials every day. From pastas to veggie burgers
to stir fries to stews, there's something for everyone who's feeling a bit
in the "vegetable way." And its all served in a cozy, urbane atmosphere that
will undoubtedly keep you coming back for more. 
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Tjaarda's, All Night Eggplant, Tomato Head, Falafel
Hut
<H2>Best Italian Restaurant, Best Romantic Atmosphere
</H2><P><STRONG>Naples</STRONG>
<P>Naples has always had a special place in the hearts of Knoxvillians, who
have long appreciated its romantic atmosphere, delicious Italian cuisine,
and reasonable prices. It is the kind of restaurant where memories are made--and
we're not just saying that. If you haven't been there yet, go now. And keep
this rule in mind: the nightly special is always worth a taste. And for maximum
romantic effect, you can always share it between two, Lady and the Tramp-style.
'At's Amore!
<H2>Best Diner
</H2><P><STRONG>The Diner</STRONG>
<P>So it's not a classic diner, in the greasy-spoon sense of the word
(geez--didn't anyone see our tribute to local diners in our Restaurant Guide?).
Instead, The Diner is an art-deco wonder that serves up not only great hamburgers
(it was Litton's love child, remember) but some wholly respectable
continental-style cuisine. Believe it or not, their Boston scrod rivals even
Regas's classic King Georges standard. And the mustard-marinated pork loin
is out of this world.
<H2>Best Asian Restaurant
</H2><P><STRONG>Stir Fry Cafe</STRONG>
<P>It just is. Stir Fry Cafe is a wonderful restaurant offering Knoxville
palates the tongue-tantalizing, tempting spicy cuisine of the far East. Their
Chinese specialties are top rate, but it's the Thai food that keeps us coming
back for more. Their pad thai is to die for, their curries divine, and their
soups guaranteed to clear up any nasal congestion in only one sip. With its
live music on the weekends, and its location right next to Bookstar, it's
a primo date destination.
<H2>Best Mexican Restaurant
</H2><P><STRONG>La Paz</STRONG>
<P>Go ahead and take the plunge on the extra-hot sauce when they bring out
the tortilla chips; the busboy makes it his special mission to keep your
water glass filled. And that's just the first of many indulgences when you
sit down at La Paz, from the zingy zapnins to the flavorful fajitas to the
magnificent margaritas. Even with the ever-increasing number of
south-of-the-border specialty restaurants, this jazzy little hole in Suburban
Center remains at the top of the heap.
<H2>Best Brewpub
</H2><P><STRONG>The Smoky Mountain Brewery</STRONG>
<P>Sad to say, our first brewpub, and still our favorite, closed indefinitely
just as y'all were sending us ballots. With its "private" cigar-and-Scotch
lounge and huge mahogany bar, no saloon in modern Knoxville was ever as
extravagant--and, to a loyal several, as beloved--in its mere 19 months of
camaraderie, comfort, and very good beer. But the Mill, our second-place
finisher, still thrives, as does Calhoun's, an honorable third.
<H2>Best Bagel Shop
</H2><P><STRONG>New York Bagel Shop and Deli</STRONG>
<P>For breakfast, lunch and dinner, bagels are the Everymeal, and Knoxvillians
are jumping on the wagon like never before. If you want proof, just try going
into either of the New York Bagel Shop's locations between noon and 2 p.m--just
be ready and willing to elbow your way up to the case displaying at least
a dozen different flavors, including the ever-popular "everything." And,
after all, what more could you ask for?
<H2>Best Cafeteria
</H2><P><STRONG>S &amp; S Cafeteria</STRONG>
<P>When Mom's out of pocket (or just out of sorts), many Knoxvillians turn
to one of the city's two S &amp; S cafeterias for supper or Sunday dinner--roast
beef, ham, chicken, fish, and a selection of vegetables that should satisfy
even the most picky four-year-old. Whether you go to the old-fashioned version
on the western edge of Sequoyah Hills or the one with the trendy decor near
Cedar Bluff, you're sure to see someone you know getting home cooking without
going home.
<H2>Best Happy Hour
</H2><P><STRONG>Hawkeye's </STRONG>
<P>It's more than just the three-for-one "Animal Hour" every weeknight from
9 to 10 p.m. (although that's a big part of it.) There's also a certain
intangible essence, a suncity, rustic ambiance that invites frat boys, hippies
and yuppies alike to mingle, raise a toast and groove hip-to-hip on cool
blues sounds from any number of crack local bands that regularly grace the
upstairs bar.
<H2>Best Ribs
</H2><P><STRONG>Calhoun's</STRONG>
<P>Laying waste to the competition is Mike Chase's hometown champ, Calhoun's.
Despite all the challengers, whether they be from Memphis or Jamaica, Calhoun's
Knox-style ribs win again with the locals. So get a table with a river view
(or of Kingston Pike, if you want some micro-brew) and order a side in salute.
<H2>Best New Restaurant
</H2><P><STRONG>Romano's Macaroni Grill</STRONG>
<P>The general rule of Knoxville restaurant-going is this: if it's new, we
like it. But as it starts to age--after, say, a few months--fickleness starts
to set in, and it's on to the next new restaurant. Romano's Macaroni Grill,
however, is still hot months after its long-awaited opening, swarming with
people nearly all the time. For some, its scripted banter and meticulously
designed atmosphere is a bit too artificial, but for most Knoxvillians it
still feels fresh. Long may its plates accidentally smash.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Cozymel, Charlie Peppers
<H2><HR><A NAME=music>MUSIC &amp; CLUBS</A><HR>
</H2><P>
<H2>Best Local Bluegrass Band
</H2><P><STRONG>Susie Betts &amp; The Smokin' O's</STRONG>
<P>You can thank the former bluegrass hot spot, Marcus' Pizza, for this
conglomeration. Formed almost two years ago to take the stage in Fountain
City, the Smokin' O's features singer and guitar picker Betts, backed up
by Dobro dazzler Phil Leadbetter (whose "day" job involves the same instrument,
played behind bluegrass master J. D. Crowe), Albert Styles on guitar, and
Mark Brooks on double bass. Separately, you're apt to catch these pickers
all over: Betts charms tourists by the score down at Uncle Bud's Catfish
in Pigeon Forge, and Styles and Brooks both hang their hats at Dollywood.
Together, your best chance to hear them will be this summer on the deck at
Charlie Pepper's. Their specialty is progressive 'grass, so don't set your
heart on "Uncle Pen" or "Barefoot Nellie."
<H2>Best Local Jazz Band
</H2><P><STRONG>Jazz Liberation Quartet </STRONG>
<P>Even with departure of guitarist and scene fixture Dave Nichols (who literally
ran off to join the circus), JLQ kept the zing in its swing, entertaining
jazz and rock fans alike with an off-kilter mix of corrupted bop, fusiony
rock and low-down fonk. If you haven't seen JLQ lately, then you haven't
seen JLQ.
<H2>Best Local Blues Band
</H2><P><STRONG>Crawdaddy </STRONG>
<P>Although Knoxville's best blues band isn't just a blues band, they imbue
their reggae, rock, soul and R&amp;B covers and originals with a certain
blues verity. Lest you doubt, go watch Michael Crawley and Co. set butts
a-shakin' at Hawkeye's on a Thursday night, and see if it doesn't conjure
images of a crowded Delta juke joint after a day in the cotton fields. Between
Crawley's blazing harp and guitarist Detroit Dave's manic splatter, these
boys got the mojo working.
<H2>Best Local Rock Band
</H2><P><STRONG>Superdrag</STRONG>
<P>Knoxville's Fab Four had quite a whirlwind year: getting swept up by a
major label; releasing an acclaimed indie album (The Fabulous Eight-Track
Sounds of Superdrag   on Darla Records); touring the country with buzz bands
and indie stalwarts the likes of Letters to Cleo, Echobelly, and Archers
of Loaf; recording with cooler-than-thou producer Tim (Sebadoh, Belly) O'Heir;
playing shows in front of such celebrity types as Drew Barrymore and Johnny
Rotten; and garnering glowing profiles in Raygun, Alternative Press, College
Music Journal, Melody Maker and other esteemed rock publications.
With their Elektra Records debut Regretfully Yours still fresh on the shelves,
it remains to be seen whether they're going to put us on the map (reviews
have been mighty positive, though, including a recent A-minus in Entertainment
Weekly), but one thing's for sure: Knoxville loves them.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> State Champs, Thumbnail
<H2>Best Local Acoustic Band
</H2><P><STRONG>Rhodes &amp; Rhodes</STRONG>
<P>The perennial Old City favorites win over the masses with their gentle
takes on acoustic classics and their own originals.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Sara Lite, Crawbaby, Atom Bomb Pocketknife
<H2>Best Local R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Band
</H2><P><STRONG>L.I.F.E.</STRONG>
<P>YO! Straight outta K-town comes L.I.F.E., those ever phresh, phat, phunky
rap 'n' rollers who made the cut for the Music Association of Knoxville Showcase
this year. They've added another accolade by winning as best hip-hop act,
proving they're, yes, "down" with Knoxville audiences.
<H2>Best Country Band
</H2><P><STRONG>The V***roys</STRONG>
<P>A.k.a. the Viceroys. Are they rock 'n' roll or country? We've apparently
decided the wildmen in ties are the latter. Now going by the copyright-mandated
alias, V-Roys, they're off on a tour of England with Steve Earle, and their
own CD is due for international release this summer.
<H2>Best Male Vocalist
</H2><P><STRONG>Justin Sinkovich </STRONG>
<P>Knoxville doesn't mind a little grit and venom in its vocalists. The
downy-cheeked 23-year-old patriarch of the city's newest wave of punk rockers
won handily over such contenders as smooth-crooning John Davis of Superdrag
and the lonesome-wailing Scott Miller of the Viceroys (the pleasantly raspy
Michael Crawley also fared well.) Cargo/Headhunter Records must have agreed
with your choice; that California bastion of indie hipness signed Sinkovich's
progressive punk Thumbnail to a contract in late '95. You can hear Sinkovich
exercise the more sensitive side of his chords when he fronts his other band,
rattle-pop trio Atom Bomb Pocket Knife.
<EM>Close Runners Up:</EM>Johnny Turbo (State Champs), Michael Crawley
(Crawdaddy)
<H2>Best Female Vocalist, Best Local Release
</H2><P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="../../dir_suncity/bok_dir/bok_release.gif" WIDTH="108" HEIGHT="93" HSPACE="10"><STRONG>Nancy
Brennan Strange,
Les Etoiles Mysterieuse</STRONG>
<P>Nancy Brennan Strange deserves recognition for many things. Over the past
two and a half decades she's done wonderful things in and around Knoxville
in the forms of folk music, storytelling, cultural and historical arts, and
most recently jazz. Last year she released a lovely compact disc, Les Etoiles
Mysterieuse(Strange Stars), which features an orchestra of Knoxville's jazz
elite. She mentioned then that she was grateful for the local jazz venues,
such as Alive After Five and Lucille's, which allow her to sing often without
relocating to more musical but less pleasant environs like New York. Strange
is one of many who return the favor to local folks who wish to hear fine
music and prefer to do it here.
<H2>Best Songwriter
</H2><P><STRONG>Scott Miller</STRONG>
<P>Solo, leading an acoustic trio, or fronting the Viceroys, the skinny kid
from the Shenandoah Valley is our favorite songwriter, author of over 100
good songs, including "Goodnight, Loser," "Lie I Believe," and his solo
"Napoleon" which appears on a recent Bubbapalooza compilation CD--whether
you think he looks like Hank Senior or not.
<H2>Best Church Choir
</H2><P><STRONG>Sacred Heart Cathedral Choir</STRONG>
<P>Under the leadership of director Donna Swan (don't tell anyone she's actually
an Episcopalian) and organist Robert McCarter, this group of 30-odd people
sings for the Sunday 10:30 a.m. Mass; and the cathedral's women's choir sings
for the 6 p.m. Saturday service. The group is ambitious; their Easter season
repertoire included Faur&eacute;'s Requiem this year.
<H2>Best Rock Club
</H2><P><STRONG>Mercury Theater </STRONG>
<P>It's not too big and it's not too small, it's got a decent beer selection
and it's agreeably dive-ish. The decor is trendy in a cool and shabby sort
of way, and owner Kevin Niceley keeps it booked with quality local, regional,
indie and even major-label acts. In short, the Mercury is everything a rock
club should be. Wish we had more like it.
<H2>Best Jazz Club
</H2><P><STRONG>Lucille's</STRONG>
<P>We're in shock about this one. Not because Lucille's won; that was no
contest. With an astonishing variety of live jazz going past midnight six
nights a week, Lucille's (formerly Annie's), with more than a dozen years
of live jazz in the old city under its belt, polled more votes than all other
clubs put together. Known by reputation far outside the Tennessee Valley,
those who know jazz say it's a shoo-in as best jazz club in the state. Where
else in the world can you expect to see world-class musicians like pianist
Donald Brown--for two bucks? Lucille's status as Best was obvious. We're
shocked because, just as we tallied these results, the tax folks padlocked
Lucille's doors (through an apparent misunderstanding). After being unable
to find a seat at recent crowded evenings there, we can only figure they've
been undercharging for beer and wine. They're still trying. Stay tuned.
<H2>Best Country and Western Club
</H2><P><STRONG>Cotton-Eyed Joe</STRONG>
<P>Heeeeeee-Hawww! Pull on those shit-kickers, put on that ten-gallon hat
and be sure to tuck that shirt into those tight-fitting jeans. This mammoth
West Knox warehouse sent its competition scurrying into a pit filled with
tribute bands and Tex-Mex food, and now reigns supreme as the King of country
dance.
<H2>Best Dance Club/Dance Club DJ
</H2><P><STRONG>Underground/Storm</STRONG>
<P>Scott Wilkerson of local techno band the Speed Freeks said it best: "Knoxville
is a one [dance] club town." Sure, there are others that are often hipper
and always more intimate: Lord Lindsey's, Trump's, Mercury Theater--but for
the biggest sound, the brightest lights and the bubbling-over crowds, the
Underground has no competition. And on Wednesday nights, you can find DJ
Storm, leader of the old school Knoxville DJ's, spinning label-less slabs
of subterranean vinyl and flashy club cuts together, while the club kids,
frat boys and suburban gangstas shake it, baby, shake it, till 3 a.m.
<H2>Best Piano Bar
</H2><P><STRONG>Ivory's</STRONG>
<P>Almost subterranean, tucked discreetly away beneath Andrew Morton's gift
shop in Bearden, Ivory's is a piano speakeasy, a favorite refuge of both
performers and pianists--for those who've learned to overlook the Sequoyah
Hills riffraff. Performers are consistently good; both low-key locals and
traveling stars make their way to Ivory's stage.
<H2>Best Dive
</H2><P><STRONG>Gryphon's</STRONG>
<P>Hey, that's spin-cycle dive to you, bub. Fort Sanders's own combination
bar, coin laundry and low-rent music venue, Gryphon's may not be for the
faint of heart, but it certainly possesses more beer-stained charm than any
other neighborhood bar we can think of. Musically, you can find just about
anything and everything here, from post-punk to blues to acoustic folk. Lots
of local bands get their start on Gryphon's nonexistent stage, and we can't
think of the last time there was any sort of cover charge. And, band or not,
you're always guaranteed some sort of entertainment.
<H2>Best Concert Venue
</H2><P><STRONG>Bijou Theatre</STRONG>
<P>There's just not a bad seat in the house--not even up in the second balcony,
where there are no seats. It's a fitting showcase for fine performers (luminaries
from the Marx Brothers to Mel Torme to Los Lobos have basked in the glow
of those footlights) and it somehow seems to enhance lesser talents. Here's
to the ongoing restoration drive and the hope for a men's room where the
"fixtures" aren't in view of the whole lobby when someone opens the door.
<H2>Best Place for Men to Meet Women<BR>Best Place for Women to Meet Men
</H2><P><STRONG>Michael's</STRONG>
<P>Is it the availability of immediate seating? Is it the gold chains and
expensive sportswear? Perhaps the small, often packed dance floor? Regardless
of the specifics, Michael's is the only place in town that recreates the
unbridled, fin-de-si&egrave;cle glory of Reagan's last term--the perfect
atmosphere for meeting that special someone, at least until the vodka wears
off.
<H2>Best Place for Men to Meet Men<BR>Best Place for Women to Meet Women
</H2><P><STRONG>Carousel </STRONG>
<P>From the flashing lights and disco balls to the pit-style dance floor
to the lavish drag productions upstairs, the Carousel is a colorful carnival
of androgyny, the place to watch and be watched. And even if you're not on
the make, the Carousel is a delightful detour, a diversion from mainstream
mundanity.

<H2>Best Radio Station
</H2><P><STRONG>WNFZ-FM 94.3</STRONG>
<P>Their ratings may lag behind the big dinosaurs--er, dogs--but scrappy
newcomer WNFZ-FM knocked the other stations off the dial with their commercial
alternative (read: MTV Buzz Bin minus video) soundwaves. Sure, their rotation
playlist can be a bit repetitive (how many times a day do we really need
to hear Alanis remind us of life's little ironies?), but 94-Z also manages
to sound simultaneously slicker and fresher than a lot of the competition.

Williams, WIMZ
"Phil and Billy in the Morning"</STRONG>
<P>Even if you're fed up with "Free Bird," it's almost worth wading through
the retread to sample Philbio's backwoods wit, fraught with clever current
events references and cartoonish character voices conjured at the spur of
the moment. And although we miss the sober balance of Colvin Idol, who was
abruptly dismissed last year, Billy the Kid provides his Philness with an
able partner in chortle.<BR CLEAR=ALL>

Bill Williams, Bob Kesling, Marti Skold</STRONG>
<P>Anchor veteran Bill Williams has a certain grandfatherly charm--warm,
but low on mindless prattle. And Big Bob is always well-spoken and well-informed
behind the sports desk, engaging in his self-assured equanimity. And Marti
always exhibits preternatural calm before the storm--no matter how big it
is. They're just some of the reasons why WBIR remains, year in and year out,
head and shoulders above its competitors.

<P>The affable, nearly unflappable Hill generally exudes courtesy and happy

Hill describes himself as a political moderate, but is becoming hard to
distinguish from any other East Tennessee Republican these days, and struggled
unsuccessfully to dampen his pro-Lamar Alexander sentiments.

<P>For another year, Channel 10's Live at Five crew takes the local TV show
honor, reveling in the droll repartee of co-hosts Ted Hall and Moira Kaye
as they investigate Knoxville's fun and frisky quirks. But what's this? Hot
on its heels is none other than TNi's Prime Talk, rising up the ranks with
a growing popularity, no doubt due to the talk show's suncity-yet-charming

</H2><P><STRONG>The Waterfront</STRONG>
<P>Who knew such a teeny stretch of poisoned riverfront property could cause
such a fuss? But there it is: on one hand, waterfront development is a bit
of vitally needed downtown revitalization; on the other hand, will it really
work? Are interactive kiosks and virtual reality dioramas really gonna pull
in enough tourists to use up Mike Chase's parking lot? Can an $8 million
strip of concrete spur further private development? Let me tell you a story
about the World's Fair Site...
<BR><EM>Other Noteworthy Squabbles: </EM>City/county unification, Joe Taylor,
the Knox County Sheriff's firing range, the evolution bill, the farmer's

<H2>Best Thing the City Ought to Spend Money On
</H2><P><STRONG>Schools/Education</STRONG>
<P>Despite the ongoing concern over how much the school budget creeps up

like to spend more money on. Could it possibly be that we ought to spend
more on the education of our children, helping to ensure their futures as
productive adults? And, while we're at it, how about implementing some art

foolishness.
<BR><EM>Close Runners Up:</EM> Better roads, downtown revitalization, waterfront

on The X-Files
</H2><P><STRONG>Cas Walker</STRONG>
<P>Hey, the truth is out there. Or maybe it's here, too.
<BR><EM>The Imaginative Suggestions: </EM>The alien had consented to metro
government, the alien wanted to benefit from TennCare, an intuitive grasp
of what's really happening at the body farm, they were seeking the human
gene that causes running red lights, somebody thought they were in Asheville,
one city council meeting would help you understand, it's somehow connected
to waterfront development, TVA.
<BR><EM>The Unimaginative Suggestions: </EM>Weird, what the hell does this
mean, don't watch this, no idea, dumbest attempt at a category by Metro Pulse.
Uhhhh...Right: Make it legal to drink in the roadway and park, love--it's
only love, sanctimony, mimicking Warren Christopher's profile.
<BR><EM>Most Plausible:</EM> The director is related to the brother of a
woman who drove past Knoxville in 1982.
<BR><EM>The Patently Vicious:</EM> Randall Pedigo did it, they were trying
to give David Keith a talent transfusion and it failed, they could only get
an appointment with Stephen Cobble.
<BR><EM>Bliiiiiiimps: </EM>They arrived in a blimp.
<H2>Best Way to Get a Market Square Preacher to Stop Screaming at People
</H2><P><STRONG>Various forms of violence</STRONG>
<P>Although "Ignore him" certainly got a lot of votes (and we personally
advocate it), most people recommended some form of physical harm. From the
very simple "kill him" to the kicking of particular body parts, Knoxvillians
seem hell-bent on stifling loud religious expression on their lunch hour.
Suggested weapons include 357 Magnums, .38's, .45's, 9 mm's, stakes, fists,
cars, hand grenades, electricity, mace and a calzone.
<BR><EM>The More Humorous Suggestions:</EM> Institute a dress code, agree
with him, give him a hug, quote the Koran, repent en masse, reveal his tax
returns, talk to him rationally until you confuse him, tell him Jesus was
a liberal Jew.
<BR><EM>The Somewhat Sacrilegious: </EM>Dress up like Jesus, place your hand
on his shoulder, and say "I'll take it from here."
<BR><EM>Blimpblimpblimpblimp:</EM> Land a blimp on him.
<H2>Best Way to Repopulate Gay Street
</H2><P><STRONG>Free Parking</STRONG>
<P>Well, yeah, that would bring in more people--though the key is probably
having something there for them to park for. Suggestions included stores,
restaurants, bars, apartments and brothels. Many also said Gay Street ought
to be cleaned up and renovated, luring in new businesses and redevelopers
with tax incentives. 
<BR><EM>You Know It's Coming:</EM> Buy a blimp.
<H2>Best Category We Didn't List
</H2><P><STRONG>Best Fast Food</STRONG>
<P>Uh, yeah, we guess.
Other Good Suggestions That Would Make the Poll as Big as an Encyclopedia,
Thus Driving Us Further Into the Pits of Insanity: Neighborhood, newspaper
(hmph), local eccentric, 'zine, bank, bar, cappuccino, child care facility,
teacher, patio, graffiti, punk band, couple, doctor, home improvement store,
local commercial, jewelry shop, cemetery, dating service, hospital, lounge
singer, office supplies, web site, manicurist, public swimming pool, make-out
spot, social service/ nonprofit program. 
<BR><EM>"Worst" Suggestions:</EM> Worst corporation, worst local newspaper,
worst things Knoxville spent money on, worst poll in K-town.

<BR><EM>Oh,
Heck--Why Not: </EM>Drag king, hooters, kick in the jimmy, way
to reduce crime ("Don't let UT football players out without their chaperones."),
best looking red-headed chick, local hack writer, restaurant that closed.
<BR><EM>AAAAAAGH:

Music to Make Money By</H1>
<P><STRONG>Sevier cities are humming as music theaters settle on Highway 66</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Mike Gibson/EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>It's a drizzly, miserable Monday night in Pigeon Forge, but there's a near sellout crowd packing T. G. Sheppard's Theater in the Smokies. A hush falls over the plush 1,500-seat auditorium as lights dim and tense synth notes swell, presaging the grand entrance of the venue's dapper namesake.<P>
A massive red velvet curtain opens abruptly on a six-piece band bathed in fluorescent blue, and the crowd nearly explodes as Sheppard, nattily attired in black tux and spats, strolls out of the wings and soars into the evening's opening number, a cover of Ronnie Milsap's "Smoky Mountain Rain."<P>
His affable baritone in fine form, Sheppard leads crack sidemen through a two-hour set that encompasses three costume changes and a passel of aim-to-please favorites, including several of his own swaggering country and crossover hits, some Vegas flourishes and a set-closing patriotic medley. The audience, solidly salt-of-the-earth and middle class, loves every God-fearing, multi-platinum moment.<P>
Operating since Aug. 1, Sheppard's is the first celebrity theater to open its box office in Sevier County, but it certainly won't be the last. On April 1, Lee "God Bless the U.S.A." Greenwood's palatial new $10 million, 1780-seat theater off Highway 66, just outside the Sevierville city limits, held its black-tie grand opening before a capacity crowd of local celebs and politicos that included former President George Bush and his wife Barbara.<P>
One mile south of the Greenwood manse, B. J. Thomas, he of raindrops fame, is set to break ground on his concert house across from the Sevierville Chamber of Commerce. And on the nearby 300-acre, $150 million Echota resort development, various partners (including the Southern Gospel Music Association) plan a three-story, 40,000-square-foot Southern Gospel Hall of Fame and Museum with ties to an adjacent 1,000-seat dinner theater to be headlined by gospel legend and SGMA head J. D. Sumner.<P>
All told, Sevier county is now home to eight major music theaters featuring various national and homegrown (or at least locally cultivated) stars, and a host of smaller venues and music-related attractions, like Eddie Anders's Heart and Soul Cafe in Pigeon Forge and Ronnie Milsap's Keyboard Cafe in Gatlinburg.<P>
Since 1993, investors both public and private have sunk close to $100 million into music-related projects, with more on the way; rumors of other celebrity theaters abound, swirling around every pristine inch of property on the (relatively) unsullied eight-mile stretch of 66 that runs from I-40 exit 407 to the bustling Highway 411-441 intersection in the heart of downtown Sevierville.<P>
Of course, neon tourist traps and big-dollar developments are hardly new to Sevier County. With three burbling mini-metropolises sprouting strip malls and amusement parks in the shadow of the country's most-visited national park, the county's sales tax revenues have more than doubled since 1988. And even the most conservative estimates place its annual visitor count at more than 12 million.<P>
What is new is that the latest wave of growth banks on stars, not bumper cars, inviting comparisons to Branson, Mo. Once a two-lane, one-horse wonder tucked away in the Ozark Mountains, Branson wrote its own chapter in national tourist guides when more than 15 celebrity music theaters popped out of its scrubby hills between 1976 and 1981.<P>
Unlike Branson, Sevier County adds its new attractions to an already impressive tourism portfolio, building more muscle in an economy that generated more than $1.2 billion in fiscal 1994-95, and hosted twice as many visitors as its midwestern counterpart.<P>
"I felt we already had the infrastructure, and we had the people here, with nothing for them to do at night," says Sheppard, who's been talking up music theaters ever since he moved to Sevier County 10 years ago. "I think you'll see a phenomenon similar to Branson, with four or five more major stars coming in the next couple of years alone."<P>
And it may not end with theaters. The county is already home to one major recording studio, and some theaters will sport in-house recording, broadcasting and production facilities. When developers hereabouts stare into their crystal balls, they see more than just sequined songbirds and bright stage lights; they envision a multi-media entertainment empire, a music Mecca for the information age.<P>
"The next big boost to our economy will come from the entertainment industry," says Bob DeBusk, executive director of the Sevier County Economic Development Council. "I see the opportunities first in the theaters, but then in recording studios, sound stages, broadcast facilities. I see a whole avenue of entertainment and entertainment support systems. I don't think it's out of reach to one day broadcast our performances locally or even nationally."

Although the current music boom banks on Broadway-style glitz and imported stars, it has roots in the hills and hollers of East Tennessee. Bonnie Lou and Buster Moore founded the county's first music show of any note, Smoky Mountain Hayride, in the Pigeon Forge Coliseum in 1972.<P>
The show's down-home hosts had been local television variety show personalities since 1954, and their Hayride offered up clogging, bluegrass, Gospel, country and comedy seven nights a week during its June-to-Labor Day season. <P>
Early guests included Nashville steel guitar whiz Little Roy Wiggins and singer Eva Barber, who went on to croon pop and big band standards on the Lawrence Welk Show, and now headlines Pigeon Forge's Rainbow Theater along with former Elvis mime Eddie Miles.<P>
Gatlinburg was the county's boomtown in those days, and Bonnie Lou Moore remembers Bulls Gap's favorite son Archie Campbell (music and comedy) and Sevier County native Jack Brooms (bluegrass) hosting their own shows in Pigeon Forge's bustling sister city. The Forge itself, however, sported only a handful of motels, a second-rate theme park and "lots of vacant land on the Parkway."<P>
"There wasn't much there when we opened," Moore says. "Lots of people didn't know where the town was, so we advertised on our TV show 'five miles north of Gatlinburg.'"<P>
That program, the weekly half-hour "Bonnie Lou and Buster Show" on Knoxville's WATE, helped the Moores build a regional following and draw repeat visitors from surrounding states.<P>
In the meantime, Pigeon Forge's budding tourist appeal got a shot in the arm from some Branson folks. In 1976, Branson brothers Jack and Pete Herschend purchased Goldrush Junction, an ill-at-ease little Wild West theme park hidden away on the east end of the city, and revamped it with new rides and a Craftsman's Valley better suited to its Appalachian setting. The rejuvenated park was dubbed Silver Dollar City, after a similar Herschend venture that had been pulling visitors into Branson since the 1960s.<P>
In the early '80s, Branson refugee Elmer Dryer opened the city's first real music theater, Smoky Mountain Jubilee. The little theater with the colonial front and the fiddle sign seated 800 and featured local and Nashville performers in a country/oldies/comedy variety show.<P>
But it wasn't until the mid-80s and the appearance of another indigenous talent that Pigeon Forge's growth took on exponential proportions, and that music became a prime factor in the equation. In 1986, Sevier native Dolly Parton entered a partnership with Herschend Enterprises and lent her name, her considerable fame, and her bouffant blonde visage to Silver Dollar City.<P>
The Herschends were spurred by the success of the theme park's annual Mountain Music Festival, a 10-day roots-music extravaganza begun in 1980. The festival showcased country, gospel and bluegrass talent from across East Tennessee, and doubled in size in less than five years. <P>
"It let the tourist and music industry know that the people who come here are the same people who love country music--the same people who went to Branson," says Kathy Brown, a former marketing manager at Dollywood/Silver Dollar City.<P>
But the ascendance of Dolly marked the real beginning of the park's musical evolution, and the county's subsequent musical revolution. In 1988, the 1739-seat Dolly Parton Celebrity Theater opened inside the park and offered daily performances by well-known country artists like Ray Stevens and Louise Mandrell. In 1989, the Barnwood Theater hosted Dollywood's first theme park-style production show, and a handful of other new venues and production numbers followed in rapid succession.<P>
According to entertainment development manager Ray Sanderson, Dollywood 1996 will employ around 200 music-related folks, more than double the number in 1988. The park boasts three major production numbers, three 1,000-plus-seat music theaters, four daily musical performances, and a host of its own homegrown "stars," like the gospel group Kingdom Heirs, and Dolly's kin Randy Parton.<P>
"When Dolly came in, there really was an effort to steer the park toward entertainment," Sanderson says. "And I think it's had a galvanizing effect on other people, driving them to achieve the same benchmarks we have."<P>
In 1993, that spillover was the catalyst for Pigeon Forge's $11 million Music Road Entertainment Park, the project that is arguably most responsible for setting off the county's recent flash-fire explosion of theater activity. Conceived as an industrial park for entertainment, the 45-acre tract sandwiched by the Parkway and the Little Pigeon River was designed to host three large-scale theaters as well as a music-themed restaurant owned and operated by Dollywood.<P>
"The city saw an opportunity to stimulate the entertainment aspect of its appeal at the same time Dollywood was noticing the same trends we were," says John Jagger, director of economic development for Pigeon Forge. "It started a wave, but it was really just a continuation of what's been happening in Sevier County for years."<P>
Music Road's cornerstone theater, the 2,000-seat Music Mansion, opened in 1994 as Dollywood's first off-site attraction, showcasing the talents of James Rogers, the most beloved daily entertainer in the history of the park.<P>
Not quite just a singer, not quite just a songwriter, not quite just a dancer, emcee or comedian, the Chattanooga-born Rogers won the Mountain Music Festival talent contest in 1983, and went on to play in front of more than five million visitors as a spotlight performer in various Dollywood shows.<P>
If Rogers isn't the only focal point in Music Mansion's lavish Broadway-style production, he's certainly the thread that holds the sprawling three-hour stage show together. As props, backdrops, singers, dancers and musicians pop in and out like rabbits out of top hats, Rogers tells Jeff Foxworthy-style redneck jokes, sings a duet with a life-size video image of Dolly and strums a banjo along with folk and ragtime favorites.<P>
At one point, sheathed in a studded leather jacket, skin-tight chinos and black sneaks, a '50s-style Rogers coaxes his audience of predominantly middle-aged and senior tourists out of their seats and into the aisles, where they proceed to wag ample bottoms for all they're worth and sing "Shake It, Baby, Shake It" with all the high-decibel zeal their collective lung power can muster.<P>
The success of Music Mansion (Dollywood officials claim Rogers and company have played to more than half a million people in two years) and the lure of those appealing tour-bus demographics sent a domino-chain wave of construction and speculation rippling through Pigeon Forge and into Sevierville. Within two years, the Sheppard theater was up and running less than a half-mile down the Parkway, Eagle Mountain gave a new home to some old Opry stars, Sevierville developer Pete Maples announced plans for the Greenwood palace...
<H3>Forge-ing Ahead</H3>
Today, Music Mansion's latticed Victorian expanse, dotted with tiny yellow lights and neat potted plants, announces Pigeon Forge like a monolithic neon welcome mat when you drive down the Parkway from Sevierville. Go another eighth of a mile and you see the garish purple front of the Rainbow Theater, followed by Memories Theater and its blue-bolted Elvis homage.<P>
Then comes Smoky Mountain Jubilee with its famous fiddle sign, moments before you hit T. G.'s place, all gleaming stone and glass as it stares haughtily down from its lofty hilltop perch. Tucked neatly in beside it is Eddie's Heart and Soul Cafe, with plenty of buses in its undersize parking lot and a line of tourists out its door. As you drive deeper into the heart of the city, you can choose from Country Magic's parade of country music impersonators or Eagle Mountain's Opry faves--all before you hit that massive turn sign with the tousled mane that leads to Dollywood.<P>
Yesteryears, featuring different '50s and '60s rock 'n' roll headliners, will add yet another slot to the roster when it becomes Music Road's second theater next year. The lineup is impressive, but city officials believe it's just the beginning.<P>
"Sevier County doesn't need 35 theaters, but I could see more than half that in another five years," Jagger says. "We're not trying to be another Branson, but we are taking a page out of their book."<P>
It's a lucrative page. Jagger estimates that Forge amusements pulled in just over $60 million in 1995 (a 14 percent increase from '94), and City Manager Earlene Teaster says nearly half that sum came from music-related attractions.<P>
And for a city that grew at an unprecedented rate through the 1980s (Pigeon Forge has outstripped Gatlinburg in total revenues for nearly 10 years now), the spark provided by the influx of new music ventures keeps the engines of growth firing on all four cylinders.<P>
Tourist tallies tell the story, particularly at Dollywood, which surpassed Opryland in total number of visitors in 1995. Attendance jumped 75 percent (to 1.3 million) in the first year of the Parton era. After 10 years and some $50 million in improvements, that figure rose to well over two million in 1995--more than 20 percent of Pigeon Forge's total visitor count for the year.<P>
But the biggest hope local officials have for the burgeoning music biz lies in its potential to transform the entire county into a year-round destination. Unlike Branson, which built its tourist base on indoor festivities, Sevier County historically suffers epic lulls during the frigid winter months, when mountain outings lose their luster and amusement parks lock their turnstiles until spring.<P>
While local unemployment figures perennially dropped below the four percent "full employment" level in peak-season summer months, the wintertime jobless rate often soared as high as 25 percent in the mid-1980s. Those seasonal highs have dipped to around 15 percent in recent years, thanks in large part to Winterfest, a countywide promotional effort marked by special events and elaborate lighting displays in all three cities.<P>
But even Winterfest doesn't have all the answers for that bleak late-winter stretch from January to March. Conventional wisdom holds that the only remedy for those post-holiday doldrums lies in solid year-round attractions that bring in steady jobs and draw more patrons to the county's base of motels, malls and restaurants.<P>
And as more theaters break ground and more big-name entertainers ogle Sevier County real estate, Jagger believes that's already beginning to happen. He notes that most local theaters open a little earlier every year, and some now observe a weekends-only schedule throughout the winter.<P>
"I think the theaters will eventually be year-round ventures," Jagger says. "One of the biggest things that appealed to the city when it invested in Music Road was that this isn't such a seasonal phenomenon, and that we can draw people in 12 months out of the year."
<H3>Coming of Age in Sevierville</H3>
Since the 1970s, Sevierville has played chaste older sister to Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg's fun-loving tramps. With its stately, spired courthouse and classic small-town ambiance, the city struck a stern, almost paternal pose. Bereft of T-shirt shops and Putt-Putt golf, it was the county seat, home to what few manufacturing plants the region could muster, the town where Real Life took place.<P>
Then something funny happened in the 1990s. Big Sis kicked off her sensible shoes and joined the party. Nowadays, driving down 66 from the interstate at four-week intervals is like watching a new neon metropolis sprout via time-lapse photography. Every time you make the trip, there's a brand new oak and cement skeleton or another bulldozed plot somewhere along that once green and pristine stretch of Scenic Highway.<P>
Music theaters aren't the only thing going on in this fledgling vacationer's paradise. Pete Maples is touching up blueprints for a $30 million freshwater aquarium due to open in 1998 off Highway 66, while the Echota development promises more than $100 million worth of resort and rental properties. The city's hotel/motel capacity has nearly doubled (to around 700 rooms) in the last four years, with three more new motels set to open by the end of '96.<P>
And if Sevier County hooks the much-vaunted Bass Anglers Sportsmen's Society headquarters/theme park/shopping complex (the county has been in the running for the project since summer and is now one of only three sites still under consideration), the development will probably land somewhere inside Sevierville's city limits, or at least within easy annexing distance.<P>
But most local officials say music and music-related attractions will be a linchpin, a focal point around which these and other new ventures coalesce.<P>
With the Thomas and Sumner projects pending, Dollywood favorite the Southstar Band will soon occupy a 1,000-seat theater across from Wal-Mart on the Parkway. The Greenwood theater patiently awaits inevitable annexation (Greenwood already lends his name to Sevierville Chamber of Commerce recruiting efforts) and country stalwarts like Charlie Daniels, the Judds and the Statler Brothers have reportedly given the 66 acreage more than just a passing glance.<P>
"Within the next two years, I expect another three to four theaters to come in, with more major stars, followed by several new restaurant and hotel chains," says Jim Wagner, assistant city administrator and director of planning.
<H3>Production Numbers</H3>
It's 4 p.m. at Tennessee Production Center in Seymour, and there's not a quiet spot in the house. In a room lined with colorful murals and post-modern furniture, someone is editing a video of a J. D. Sumner performance filmed at Eddie's Heart and Soul Cafe. Down the hall, engineer Trey Lister uses computer software to master a cut from a Knoxville jazz band. And in yet another corner of the building, a T.P.C. employee overlooks the video production set while he listens back to some of his own acoustic guitar tracks.<P>
Former denizens of Nashville's Music Row, producer Norbert Stovall and his wife Debi brought Big Mama Recording Studio (the seed of T.P.C.) to Seymour in 1979. T.P.C.'s growth mirrors that of the county's music scene. Over the last 18 years, the Stovalls have added two more multi-track studios and expanded into karaoke track and video production.<P>
They've also worked with dozens of established pop and country stars, from Dolly to Tom T. Hall, and T.P.C. boasts two gold record compilations, including a Christmas album featuring popular Branson performers. Within the next two years, the Stovalls hope to open their own theater (with rotating celebrity headliners) equipped for live television and radio broadcasts.<P>
Looking beyond the theater boom, lots of people believe the future of the local music industry is vested in businesses like T.P.C.<P>
"I think production facilities will be part of the overall concept as the market matures," Teaster says. "It was always part of our master plan when we invested in Music Road."<P>
If there is such a phenomenon looming somewhere on the horizon, it's still distant, hazy, more speculative than specific. But the elements are slowly falling into place. Besides T.P.C., the county sports two smaller recording studios, Underground Studios in Seymour and Mountain Star in Sevierville. At the Sheppard theater, T. G. and company hope to use in-house facilities to broadcast his performances on national cable networks sometime next year.<P>
Even more intriguing is Echota's Southern Gospel Hall of Fame and Museum, where SGMA leaders will build secondary studios for Gospel Music Television (gospel's MTV) and the Reach Radio Satellite Network. The adjacent Sumner theater will also house a recording studio, and SGMA member and Singing News magazine editor Jerry Kirksey says Sevier County could become a hub for the entire industry.<P>
"Southern gospel doesn't really have a home base right now," Kirksey says. "If we've got our hall of fame there, we'd like to have our promotional elements there as well. Our radio and television outreach may eventually base their operations in Sevierville."<P>
It's too early to tell whether T.P.C., Echota et al. will levitate Sevier County above Branson and Myrtle Beach. If the county doesn't make it beyond the realm of seasonal spurts and tourist traps, it won't have been for lack of effort. But for now, Sevier County's bright star is still rising, and its leaders see a whole new universe of possibilities in the cafes and concert houses shining new lights on its tiny neon cities.<P>
"The entertainment industry gives us a two-edged sword," DeBusk says. "The first edge is the venues and the support systems they foster. The second is the visibility it affords us across the rest of the country. It falls to us as a community to figure out the best way to take advantage of that exposure."<P>

To Believe or Not To Believe</H1>
<P><STRONG>That's on ly one of the questions as a open-minded skeptic visits area psychics</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Janet Tate</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>Come on, admit it: you've either been to a psychic or you've been tempted to go.<P>
Maybe one morning, while risking a near-death experience on Alcoa Highway, you passed Madam Renee's nearly irresistible storefront marquee ("Palms Read While U Wait") and succumbed. Or perhaps during an evening of unproductive channel-surfing you reached for the phone and dialed up a psychic hotline. <P>
Maybe you've sought a psychic by flipping through the colorful business cards, almost always adorned with butterflies or celestial logos, tacked to bulletin boards in health-food stores and shops that specialize in crystals and wind chimes: "Tarot Readings." "Past-Life Regressions." "What Color Is Your Aura?" "Palms Read; Futures Told!" Or maybe you have to know someone who knows someone if you want to find a psychic worth his or her salt, because you won't be able to book an appointment by looking under "Psychics" in the Yellow Pages. <P>
Yet thousands of us seek them out and pay them--sometimes on a regular basis, much like a psychotherapist--for their services.<P>
Empaths, intuitives, perceptives, and spiritual counselors--psychics, to you and me--aren't just for California anymore. Our East Tennessee hills are full of them, which at first blush may seem a bit strange. How can a region built on the bedrock of fundamentalist Christianity produce and nurture those who are often associated in the public mind with the occult or the dark side?<P>
But many are deeply spiritual individuals who modestly attribute their gifts to none other than the good Lord. It's religious insecurity that brings out hostility and skepticism in some people, says Bobby Drinnon, East Tennessee's premier psychic counselor. <P>
He says he was threatened with lawsuits a few years ago should he appear on a Knoxville radio show. "Those are just insecure religious people," says Drinnon. "I like to think of myself as a free-thinking Christian."<P>
Skepticism about the supernatural is common, I suppose. But why do psychics seem to elicit particularly vicious skepticism in some quarters? There's the scam-artist aura that hovers over what they do, of course. They don't belong to a dues-paying professional organization; there are no licensing requirements. But maybe the fact that there's no scientific way to verify their work is precisely the reason many of us in this jaded, cynical world hunger more than ever for something beyond.<P>
Let those who have never been tempted to consult a psychic cast the first doubt, but I maintain that we all occasionally feel the urge to get a little supernatural insight into our love lives, our careers, our loved ones, our health--the things that really matter. <P>
I set out on a spiritual quest to seek some answers of my own. Will I be famous? Will I be rich? Here's what area psychics told me.
<H3>"For a Psychic Time, Call..."</H3>
Looking under "Psychics and Mediums" in the Yellow Pages, I pass over Brigitte Nielsen's Witches of Salem, LaToya Jackson's Psychic Network, and Mother Love's Love Psychics, and settle instead on the Yellow Pages Psychic Network, a service of Zodiac Group, Inc., of Boca Raton. <P>
From the various clairvoyants offered I select "Star." Her free two-minute reading quickly turns into $95.76 (24 minutes at $3.99 per minute) as the fascinating process of hearing all about myself from a complete--but psychic!--stranger unfolds.<P>
Working only with my first name, hometown, and date of birth, Star "reads my aura"--a procedure to determine what kind of energy I emanate. Star tells me my aura is blazing white: "Very bright and forceful, very creative, with lots of wonderful energy around you." She observes that I am not fulfilled in my current work and that I require constant stimulation and movement to nurture my creativity. Yeah, she probably says that to all the white-auras.<P>
We chat like long-lost girlfriends. She confides that she's always had a gift, even as a child, and that she used to do tarot card readings for a living before she joined the Network.<P>
"It was a pretty good living. Not a lot of money, but I did okay," she says. "I can just help so many more people this way." <P>
How can she read my aura over the phone? "I just get these pictures in my head," Star explains. "I just get the sensations, and I see things. Like I see that you've got two children, and that one maybe is having school difficulties. You should have his vision checked."<P>
Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately) the Yellow Pages Psychic Network cuts off at a certain point (probably as you approach the $100 mark), so I'll never know what Star would recommend my daughter major in at college next year.
<H3>Color Me Psychic</H3>
"Your aura has three colors: green, blue and gold," Pat Sisson assures me. We're sitting on folding chairs in her north Knoxville basement den. Sisson, a cheerful, youthful, grandmotherly woman, has just returned from a trip to Tokyo, where she was featured in a documentary on psychic phenomena for Japanese television. She says she's helped the police find missing persons and otherwise aided them in solving cases.<P>
"Actually, I'm more a sensitive than a psychic," she explains. "By the way, I also channel. You should come to a session and meet Flemon, my channeler. But I feel the colors of an aura, I don't really see them.<P>
"For example, you have a band of green which goes from forest green to a mint green, and you have a band of blue that goes from royal blue almost to purple," she says.<P>
"Then you have over all of that a golden aura. The green stands for growing things, nurturing and knowledge. It also signifies money, and I'm not saying you're materialistic but you'd be a damn fool if money wasn't important to you," she laughs. "The sky blue means spirituality and lofty thoughts. You're very caring and sensitive. The royal blue stands for being faithful and true; you're a good, loyal friend. Purple stands for royalty and power. Believing in reincarnation as I do, I believe you have spent maybe a couple of lifetimes, one, for sure, in the French court. Maybe Louis XIV. And the gold stands for laughter, joy and sunlight. Gold also means you have great perceptive, intuitive powers."<P>
We discuss my past and future for about an hour and a half, while Sisson reads my palms and deals me some tarot cards. Peering at my hands, she assures me of a long, healthy life and other glad tidings. She's studying the wrinkles on the edge of my right hand when she looks up and says, "You have two children--no, you've had three, right?"--something not many people know about me. I'm impressed. <P>
But something's bothering me. All I'm hearing is wonderful stuff. What if she saw something foreboding? Would she tell me?<P>
"I tell people what I see, good or bad," she says. "I've seen gray around people, which means illness. I've read for three different people through the years who were subsequently murdered. I'd tell them what I was getting. One of them hugged me before he left and said 'Thank you so much.' At the door I said 'Please be careful,' and he said 'I will.' He said, 'You'll never know how much this has meant to me.' It was something in the reading that just put him at peace, somehow. Three weeks later he was found murdered.<P>
"If I see something I'll tell you exactly what I'm getting. It's up to you to do the interpretation. I believe we create our own reality by our thoughts and the way we react to things. We are in charge of our own destiny, and there's rhyme and reason for everything."<P>
As I leave, Sisson presses a copy of her book, The Royal Path: A Layman's Look at the Tarot, into my freshly read palm. She also gives me a recorded cassette tape of our session. Its label reads: "From Pat and Flemon."
<H3>Finding Truth in the Crawl Space</H3>
Kakie Baillee doesn't do palms or tarot cards, although she does sign (her young twin sons are hearing-impaired). Tanned and blonde, maybe in her mid-30s, Baillee shoos her dogs, Jake and Elwood, away from the front door of her Maryville split-level home and ushers me into the kitchen. We sit and she gazes out the window at the swing set and plastic toys in her backyard. Now and then she places her fingers lightly against her temples.<P>
"Your aura is gold, with some green and purple," she says. "Gold means you have psychic ability. The purple means you're a very empathic person. I see some green around your midsection--you may be prone to kidney infections.<P>
"Memories from a past life are weighing you down in this life. Maybe you left a past life unexpectedly, and you're having a hard time letting go. This is why you're drawn to antique furniture and old houses, things from the late 1800s, early 1900s You live in an old house, right?"<P>
She is uncannily correct. Baillee also tells me to check out a leaking pipe in the crawl space. It's near some ductwork with loose insulation.<P>
"And there's a two-way light switch, somewhere upstairs." She squints at the floor like she's trying to get a better look.<P>
"There's a wiring problem of some sort, a short in the wall, perhaps. Maybe about six or seven inches above the lower switch. That's just what I'm getting." (As soon as I get home I call the electrician about the hallway light that's been shorting out for months.)<P>
Baillee's a bit reluctant to be in this story. She's from homegrown Baptist stock, many of whom are ordained ministers and many of whom would prefer she keep her gifts private. It's really nothing more than a highly developed intuitive/perceptive ability, she shrugs. Everyone has it to some degree.<P>
"Sometimes we get strong feelings about things we should do or not do. It's up to us to decide to listen to that intuitive voice or to ignore it."<P>
Another way of looking at it, she says, is that the intuitive voice comes from our guardian angels, or guides--little spirits who try to help us out. In my case, the guide or guardian angel is "someone closely related to you, who died when you were a very young child. You may not even remember this person or know about her. I'm definitely getting that it was a female. Maybe a younger sibling who died, maybe a miscarriage or something."<P>
A phone call to my mother confirms that Baillee's theory does indeed have basis in fact. A couple of days later I wriggle through the basement crawl space with a flashlight and find a rather moist plumbing cut-off valve. I know where it is because it's right behind the aluminum-wrapped pink insulation dangling from our heating system's ductwork.
<H3>Traveling Through the Past</H3>
"People tell me I've got a special gift," says Lawrence Allison, who looks a bit like Wilford Brimley and conducts past-life regressions in his Maryville home. "It's not that special. You could do this. You just have to be tuned in to the Man Upstairs," he grins, pointing toward the ceiling.<P>
Allison seats you in a comfortable recliner and turns on a recording of a simulated heartbeat. As the heartbeat slows and then fades, you reach a relaxed, semi-hypnotic level of consciousness--not quite asleep but not really awake, either. He then guides you back through your childhood: to the first grade, to your first steps, your birth; and then back even further, into your previous life. With suggestions and questions he gently evokes historical details and attempts to have you relive key moments of the past life, as well as your past death.<P>
Allison has helped hundreds of locals explore living in the past--a process, he (and others) claim, which can explain problems occurring in the present.<P>
"I had one guy, he was supposed to teach a course to some high-school boys at a local school," Allison recalls. "Every time he went into the classroom, though, he just about flipped out, got real upset. He couldn't understand why. Well, we did a session, and halfway through he jumped up and started yelling, 'Look out, look out, they're going to kill us all!'" Seems the man had once died a terrible death in combat; the rows of young male students summoned up the terror of that ordeal.<P>
As with hypnosis, not everyone is a good candidate for past-life regression.<P>
"Some people are just too hyper," Allison says. "People who drink a lot of coffee, for example. I had one lady in here who was on diet pills. Whooeee! No way." Relaxation is key, he explains.<P>
Maybe I'm the hyper type, but I'm not sure I accurately accessed the late 1800s life that Baillee had alluded to. What came to me was dying during childbirth and leaving two sons behind in an old farmhouse. But I had the nagging feeling that it was all no more than some subconscious vestige of an old episode of "Little House on the Prairie." Maybe I should have revisited the court of Louis XIV instead.
<H3>Lessons from a Spiritual Counselor</H3>
"Aura colors are just vibrations of the spirits," explains Bobby Drinnon. "I don't see them every day of my life, and I can only see them in this kind of low light." He gestures about the dimly lit inner downstairs office of his picturesque, gated farm in Jefferson City, where he conducts his highly successful calling of spiritual counseling and publishes a monthly newsletter called "The Rainbow Crest: News for the Spiritually Hungry."<P>
Drinnon was raised by good churchgoing folks in and around Jefferson City, but "people always thought I was crazy," he says. "I went to lots of psychiatrists before I was 10 years old. I'd just see people's auras, I couldn't help it, and I didn't know what it meant. I couldn't stand to be in the same room with violent people. My parents thought I was making it all up."<P>
A milestone in the Bobby Drinnon folklore was his meeting at age six with a black fortuneteller who lived across the street from his grandmother. "I wanted to know about her, but everyone said she was a witch. But I went up to her, and she looked down at me and said, 'You've got a gift, boy.' Scared me to death. I ran like crazy."<P>
Bobby reads my aura colors--white, he says, and a very complex combination of cream and burnt orange. As he unravels the secrets of my soul, he doodles and scribbles incessantly on white notebook paper, writing down some of the words he says, then going back over them again and again.<P>
Within 10 minutes I have to remind myself that I just met this man who's explaining my life, from dysfunctional childhood to career-conflicted adulthood, with more insight than two years' worth of psychotherapy.<P>
Drinnon prefers to be called a spiritual counselor rather than a psychic, and he supplements what he feels and sees about you with "lessons," spiritually driven recommendations for leading your life. It's a distinction he was forced to sue the state of Tennessee over a few years ago, when the Department of Revenue decided what Drinnon did fell under the heading of  "entertainment" and tried to retroactively apply the state's amusement tax to his practice.<P>
"It would have ruined us financially," says Drinnon, whose attorney argued convincingly that if his client's work was amusement, then so was that of televangelists and Sunday-morning radio preachers.<P>
Actually, Drinnon claims, you can be an agnostic or atheist and still be a spiritually inclined psychic.<P>
"I happen to believe in God, but I don't think it's necessary to do what I do," he says.<P>
What about past lives?<P>
"I don't really deal with reincarnation. I think present life is hard enough," he says, laughing. "It's never been proven to me, and I personally don't see it relating to present life."<P>
I tell him other psychics have seen different colors in my aura than he has. He shrugs: "We all see colors differently."<P>
These days, Drinnon says, he values his privacy more than publicity: "I was offered a great deal of money to do one of those psychic networks, but I turned it down. I just want to do the work I'm doing here. I quit doing interviews. I'm just booked up so far (through the year 2000, he says), and it's frustrating to do an article and then people call and you can't help them."<P>
For days after my session with Drinnon I shamelessly bore friends, family, and chance acquaintances with selected bits and pieces of What Bobby Said: Bobby said I need to exercise more or I'll get arthritis; Bobby said when he was a child he read Red Skelton's aura; Bobby said I would be a famous writer someday. At dinner parties I compare my aura colors with those of other cognoscenti. I am dumbfounded to discover that nearly everyone I know has either been to see Bobby (some are regulars and have been for years) or knows someone who has.
<H3>Skepticism Revisited</H3>
It's entirely possible, I suppose, that once a psychic hangs up the phone from making your appointment he or she turns directly to a computer and logs into one of the huge repositories of medical, financial, and other personal information that exist to provide banks and insurance companies with reasons to reject you. The logistical likelihood of this still seems remote to me; but all these things and even more, my more cynical of my friends insist, are what people like Bobby Drinnon do prior to a reading.<P>
"Of course he's booked up for years in advance," snorted one. "He's got to have time to research your life first."<P>
I don't know about that. What would be the point? With the possible exception of Drinnon, I didn't see a whole lot of money being made by those who are called to use their psychic abilities.<P>
Although I tried to keep a poker face at all times, I got the feeling on occasion that some of the psychics I talked to were reading my expression, veering away from a subject when they perceived disagreement on my part. When I didn't react one way or another, they would say, "That's something to watch for. See what that turns into." But they also were able to tell me things no one else could possibly know--and in some instances things I didn't even know--which turned out to be true<P>
Maybe you're either prone to believe there's something there, or you're not, but it seems the best of psychic experiences are ones where there's true give and take involved. As do all the intuitives I spoke with, Pat Sisson insists most people have the gift to one degree or another. It's just a matter of recognizing the ability and cultivating it.<P>
"I've been doing this for 30 years," she says, "and I've often said Lord, don't let anyone come to me that I cannot help--and learn from."<P>

Between Old &amp; Young</H1>
<P><STRONG>The Demands of Child-Rearing Not Yet Behind Them, Many Baby Boomers Must Also Focus Their Care-Giving Efforts on Aging Parents</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Brooks Clark</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>Dr. Colvin Idol worked for almost half a century as a doctor in South Knoxville. At the age of 70 he retired, but only because of the effects of Parkinson's disease. That was 12 years ago.
<P>Now Dr. Idol is confined to a wheelchair. He lives at home under 24-hour care, paid for by Medicare. Though he is fed by a tube and can speak only rarely, his mind remains sharp.
<P>"The burden on him must be amazing," says his son, Colvin Jr. "This is a man who used to write poetry, whose mind is still there, who can't speak."
<P>Not long ago the retired physician diagnosed himself with pneumonia in his right lung and told his caretaker to get him to a hospital.
<P>"If he said so, call an ambulance," the son told his father's caregivers. "He knows."
<P>The younger Idol, 48, makes all the arrangements for his father, visits regularly, takes him to doctor's appointments, and mows the lawn.
<P>"I don't even mow my own lawn, but I mow his every week," says Colvin Jr., known around Knoxville for his career in broadcasting and as education director of AIDS Response Knoxville.
<P>Idol is considering cutting back to part-time work so that he can better tend to his father, but demands on the son's time and energy are only a part of the burden. There's the psychological weight of watching a parent suffer a degenerative illness.
<P>"It would be much worse if I didn't have the total support of my wife, who's a psychologist," he says. Idol's wife, Saroj Chand, is a psychotherapist in private practice.
<P>With a daughter who's a social worker in Knoxville and two sons in college, the Idols are part of a growing segment of Baby Boomers who find themselves, just as their children leave home for independence, having to turn their care-giving attention to aging parents.
<H3>The Sandwich Generation</H3>
<P>If you've never been faced with caring for an elderly parent or relative, you may not have an up-to-date picture of senior care in the '90s. But statistics indicate there's a good likelihood that sooner or later you will. By 2000, nearly half of all working-age people in the country will have some day-to-day responsibility for elderly parents.
<P>The reason is that Americans are living longer than they used to. The average life expectancy is creeping upward, and the nation's fastest-growing population group is those over 85. At the same time, our definition of frailty is changing even more dramatically. Nowadays, large numbers of healthy seniors take up tennis for the first time after 65. Many live with minimal assistance past 75 and beyond.
<P>One upshot is that in place of nursing homes, we are developing different choices to answer the specific needs of individuals from the mobile, active older person to the Alzheimer's patient. Another implication is that the burden for finding these solutions and making them work is falling on the generation best known for doing its own thing.
<P>The wags in charge of identifying and naming national trends have already gotten hold of this life-experience Boomer happening. As a result, history's most over-named generation is now "The Sandwich Generation," caught between late-in-life children and long-living parents.
<P>Many Boomers are beyond their child-rearing years when they face the toughest trials of elder care. But more and more are finding themselves taking over daily care issues ranging from the minor--handling finances, medical bills and legal matters, taking care of household tasks and home upkeep, ferrying to and from appointments--to the more major ones that call for help from places like the Senior Citizens Home Assistance Service, a private company providing everything from companionship and light housekeeping to medical monitoring.
<H3>Angels for Senior Citizens</H3>
<P>Peggy Wirtz got a personal perspective on services for the elderly when she found herself coordinating the care of five elderly relatives--her mother, her father, her father's sister and two elderly cousins (two of them Alzheimer's patients)--all at the same time. Now Wirtz is the aging services specialist for the Knoxville-Knox County Office on Aging.
<P>"When people call us," says Wirtz, "we find that the first thing we need to do is help them think through what the problem really is. Often a person will say, 'I need to know about nursing homes.' They are in the midst of a crisis, often a health crisis. Often the answer is not a nursing home. Often the answer is an assisted-care facility, or in-home care."
<P>After Helen Demerath's husband died two months ago, she decided it was time to move from her retirement-community home outside of Tucson, Ariz., to be near her daughter, Julie Hardin, in Knoxville. Demerath is wheelchair-bound and 83. With help from Wirtz, Hardin--a former director of Big Brothers/Big Sisters and a former mental-health social worker--investigated 14 assisted-living care facilities.
<P>Hardin eventually narrowed the choices to Weston Place, an assisted-living community off Middlebrook Pike, and Colonial Hills, a nursing center in Maryville that offers all three levels of senior care--the full-time care of a nursing home, intermediate care (involving help with daily tasks), and basic assisted living. Last month Demerath looked at both and chose Weston Place, and she hopes to move there in September.
<P>"The science of gerontology has blossomed in the past 20 years," says Hardin. "It's something that's talked about. And we know a great deal more about the aging process and how to care for aging people."
<P>In Knox County, some 59,000 out of the total population of 343,000 are over the age of 60. Some 31,000 of those are over 70, and some 4,600 are over 85. The Office on Aging has 45 employees, including drivers. Among its services, the Office publishes a 155-page "Service Directory for Older Citizens" listing every conceivable advocacy group, support organization or government office that can offer assistance to seniors.
<P>The hub of public-agency activity is the Community Action Committee, a conglomeration of dozens of programs provided serving people of all ages and headquartered in the MLB (Mechanicsville-Lonsdale-Beaumont) Community Building on Western Avenue. Nonetheless, local resources are hard put to keep up with the demand.
<P>You don't hear much anti-government invective from families of senior citizens who are living on Social Security and modest pensions, who absolutely need Medicare, who depend every day on the work of selfless public servants like Peggy Wirtz. Like the care and education of children, senior care is an area of government that continues to grow. All the debates--even those about Medicare--are about slowing the growth, but the growth is inevitable.
<H3>The People of Bridgeview</H3>
<P>Mary Hinerman spent most of her life in Fort Worth, Tex., where she worked for 25 years in insurance and admitting at a hospital. In 1980, when she was 65, Hinerman retired and moved to Knoxville to be near her son, Bob, an insurance broker, and his wife, Jo, a Food City home products demonstrator. Hinerman lived happily in Townview Towers until 1994, when a bout with pneumonia put her in Baptist Hospital.
<P>Even before the pneumonia, Hinerman had grown less and less capable of managing her own apartment. After she recovered, she moved into Bob and Jo's South Knoxville home, where she received various health services (provided by Medicare) through First American Home Health Care. Still, it wasn't a long-term solution.
<P>"My mother has lived by herself for many years," says Bob Hinerman. "It really wasn't on her long-term agenda to move in with her son."
<P>Last summer, the Hinermans heard about Bridgeview Assisted Living Facility, a subsidized-housing operation on the second floor of Isabella Towers near Summit Hill Drive. It offers residences for 31 senior citizens, who are provided with food, services and health care. Last September, at a healthy 81, an elated Hinerman moved in to Bridgeview.
<P>"I'm amazed at the service they have to offer," says Bob Hinerman. "And it's the only facility of its kind in the area."
<P>Bridgeview is run by KCDC's case management services office. Mary Drexler is program administrator, and Tracy Black is program coordinator. It has a waiting list of 37.
<P>"I get calls every day," says Black. "I could fill another one."
<P>Generally, qualification for Bridgeview falls under the same guidelines as subsidized housing. Elderly persons must have assets and income of no more than $21,900. Along with a $400 service fee, which includes food, utilities and 24-hour assistance, the rent is based on 30 percent of adjusted income.
<P>"So a person on social security can do it," says Black.
<H3>The Deeper Issues</H3>
<P>Much of this story has revolved around the practical side of taking care of an elderly parent. Members of the Sandwich Generation must also understand the psychological and spiritual issues in reversing the roles of parent and child. Sometimes it's a task in itself to get to know a parent while simultaneously adjusting to his or her changing condition. 
<P>John Bohstedt, an associate professor of British history at UT, spent the last decade or so of his father's life working hard to repair a strained relationship. Bohstedt says he made this effort "for my own mental health and for his." According to his son, Whitey Bohstedt had been an archetypally distant, absent postwar father. He had been raised on a farm in the Depression. He was away during the war, on the road selling radio and TV parts during much of John's youth, and in a trailer in Koppell, Tex., through much of his senior years. 
<P>Over time, the son got to know the father and the father got to know the son.
<P>"You're John's father," said one of John's fellow church members at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church when Whitey Bohstedt came to town. "You must be very proud of him."
<P>As he always had, Whitey stayed quiet. For the first time, father and son talked about this stoicism. Raised on an Iowa farm, Whitey explained, "You were supposed to be modest." Bragging on your children was just like bragging on yourself. You didn't do it.
<P>After John told Whitey how he'd yearned for praise and approval, Whitey went overboard--telling everyone about his son, the professor. It was a process with unexpected results.
<P>John was surprised when he visited his son Jake's dorm room in Austin to see a picture of his own father on the wall. He was shocked when Jake said he saw some of Whitey in John--and some of Whitey and John's relationship in the interaction of son and grandson.
<P>"One of the key things is to see where we came from," says Bohstedt. "You begin to realize your parents aren't so different from other parents, and your relationships aren't that different from other people's."
<H3>As a Relationship Winds Down</H3>
<P>Whatever the details of the situation, the final years of a parent-child relationships are unavoidably poignant.
<P>For 30 years Erskine Campbell was the cashier at a drugstore in Chattanooga. She never had benefits and often worked on a cash basis. But she was always independent and dedicated her life to seeing that her son, Paul, had a better life.
<P>Around five years ago at 83, Mrs. Campbell suffered a stroke. After she left the Patricia Neal Rehabilitation Center, she lived for two years at the Golden Age Retirement Village, an independent living facility in North Knoxville operated under the aegis of New Canaan Baptist Church.
<P>"It's a wonderful place," says Paul Campbell, the director of UT's Office of Social Work Research and Public Service. "It's topnotch in every way."
<P>Over time, Erskine Campbell, who had lost most of her short-term memory, became unable feed herself. She found a spot in Bridgeview, where meals and other assisted-living care are provided. 
<P>"If my mother were not in Bridgeview, I have no idea where she would be--the system has really worked for us," her son says.
<P>What amazes Paul Campbell, who knows the social-work field from the inside, is that both facilities are so good.
<P>"Both these places are generally geared to serve those without a great deal of means, and the service and caring is as good or better than the places where people are paying. It's amazing that there are people out there who so caring and willing to work for what these places can pay them. You couldn't ask for a better staff." 
<P>Mother Campbell is always happy to see her son. Often she notices his wedding ring and asks if he's married. He tells her, yes, he's been married to Susan for 20 years.
<P>"I won't treat her like a child," says Paul. "You start doing that and you take away their dignity. I keep a picture of her from when I was about seven. It was made in a 10-cent store, in one of those booths, and she's dressed in the style of the period with her necklace, bracelet and rings.
<P>"I keep it on my bureau and I look at it every day so that in my mind I can remember what she was like."

A Space for Remembering</H1>
<P><STRONG>The monuments over our graves mark our passage, create places
for quiet contemplation</STRONG>
<P><EM>photographs by Aaron Jay, text by Jack Neely</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>We know they're there. Some
we may glance at and look away. Others we pass every day and hardly notice.
We may not look at them very closely, at least not here at home.
<P>In other places, we may visit graveyards. We likely read more tombstone
inscriptions in other places than we do here in our own home town. Maybe
we've taken tours of New Orleans cities of the dead. Maybe, hearing the famous
South Carolina ghost story, we've taken the obligatory laps around the stone
marked ALICE near Pawley's Island. Maybe we've strolled through the country
graveyard along the Cades Cove Loop. Maybe we've pondered the impressive
military cemeteries of Chattanooga, or the more solitary graves of Jackson
or Polk.
<P>At home, graveyards are different, almost too close for contemplation.
<P>They go back more than 200 years, of course. In 1793 Elizabeth Carrick,
the too-young wife of Samuel Carrick (the teacher who founded the school
that became UT), died of a fever as the city was under siege by Indians and
was buried in a quiet churchyard at the Forks of the River, east of town.
Her grave is still there, the stone more legible than many more recent ones,
but we don't have any reason to think it was the very first.
<P>Some tombstones are defiant, some poignant, some even funny.
<P>"His death was an honor to himself and an everlasting disgrace to his
enemies" reads an obelisk of a young man lynched for murder, in downtown
Knoxville. "A faithful slave, an honest freedman, lies buried here" reads
an 1882 grave in a predominantly white churchyard in Fountain City. "He was
never boring" reads a recent grave at the Jewish cemetery on Keith.
<P>Buried in Knoxville are a famous blues singer, a major-party candidate
for the presidency, an ambassador to Turkey, a U.S. Supreme Court justice,
the most hated governor in the history of Tennessee, several who were killed
in the New Market train wreck, and thousands of soldiers who died in the
Civil War. Unknown soldiers, marked UNKNOWN. And unknown civilians, their
names now illegible, worn, cracked, vanished.
<P>Buried here are the father of playwright Tennessee Williams, the mother
of novelist Frances Hodgson Burnett, and the young children of humorist George
Washington Harris. Off Western, there's a whole field of children.
<P>On Tazewell Pike is the grave that closes the novel A Death in the Family,
and on Broadway is the plot that opens the novel In the Tennessee Country.
It was the fear of a Knoxville graveyard that inspired a young newspaperboy
to work especially hard at a career that culminated in establishing a newspaper
called The New York Times.
<P>Some graves are snugly blanketed in mown grass, cheered with flowering
shrubs, in parks that are pleasant for a morning stroll. Others are forgotten,
sunken into the earth, grown over in dense thickets, their markers disintegrated
by hard weather, broken, robbed, bones laid visible. Some are commemorated
with contemporary sculpture, in artistic and architectural styles, Victorian,
art deco, minimalism, folk art; others are marked in cement, scratched on
slate, or remembered with mere rocks left on the ground. Some, the very poor
of Potter's Field, and the dead of our bloodiest war, are buried en masse,
unmarked. Some are frequently visited with flowers, or, at the Jewish graveyards,
pebbles atop the stones, one for each visitor. Many, perhaps most, are never
visited at all.
<P>All of them are places that deserve to be seen more often. All of them
teach silent lessons.
<P>Stop next time you have a minute. The history of our community is written
here, in a nonlinear stream of consciousness, with missing pages, provocative
juxtapositions, startling insights. Stop and breathe. These are some of the
quietest and most beautiful spots in Knoxville. You may lose hours in an
old graveyard without noticing, but it never seems like a waste of time.
Stop and read some names of folks who used to be our neighbors. Their families
once hoped we'd remember them forever.
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="620_pic01.gif" WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="206" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">These two
lonely graves overlook one of Knoxville's most crowded burial
fields: Bethel Cemetery, where more than 1,000 Confederate soldiers (and
perhaps some Union men as well) are buried. Most died in the Knoxville area
during the Confederate occupation (1861-63), and are buried without individual
markers; the single shaft in the background, topped with the statue of a
Confederate soldier, honors all these Southern dead. The two graves in the
foreground are those of two women of the Lusby family, who died in the 1870s.
Susan Lusby Herman, on the left, died at 19, in her first year of
marriage.
<P><IMG ALIGN=Right SRC="620_pic02.gif" WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="159" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">The Odd
Fellows graveyard on Bethel was established by a chapter of the
fraternal organization, the International Order of Odd Fellows. This cemetery
and three others that adjoin it contain the graves of many black community
leaders of the post-Civil War period.
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="620_pic04.gif" WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="159" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">The First
Presbyterian Church graveyard is so old it was called "the old
graveyard" even before the Civil War. Closed to new burials in the 1850s,
it contains the graves of Governor William Blount (1800), UT patriarch Samuel
Carrick (1809), and several other early leaders, including Senator Hugh Lawson
White, once president pro tem of the U.S. Senate (and, at Davy Crockett's
urging, a major candidate for the presidency in 1836). It fell into disrepair
during Union occupation and was for a time used as a trash dump and as a
playground for black students. It was this graveyard, circa 1870, that so
frightened young Adolph Ochs that he was willing to work extra shifts at
Market Square offices of the Knoxville Chronicle, rather than walk by it
at midnight. In so doing, Ochs learned the newspaper business inside and
out; years later, he became the defining publisher of the New York Times.
The rear of the Tennessee Theater is in the background.
<P><IMG ALIGN=Right SRC="620_pic06.gif" WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="160" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">This mournful
angel commemorates Gladys May Bright, who died the day she
was born. Her father, Zachary Taylor Bright, was a carpenter who lived with
his wife in North Knoxville. Though not regarded as significant enough for
a newspaper obituary, the Brights' distress is commemorated with one of the
more conspicuous stones in this part of Old Gray Cemetery today.
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="620_pic07.gif" WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="207" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">This lifelike
statue mourns a girl who died at seven. Lillien Gaines had
only recently moved with her parents and older brother and sister to Nashville,
where her 38-year-old dad had been elected state comptroller, when she became
ill and, several weeks later, unexpectedly died. Lillien's father, a Knoxville
native and onetime local shoe merchant, had lost an arm to a wound in the
last days of the Civil War. This Confederate officer, engaged to an Ohio
beauty before the war, had confronted his fianc&eacute; after Appomattox,
offering to release her from their pact due to his "mutilation and poverty."
She married him anyway, and they had three children. By train, Lillien's
parents brought her body back to bury her in the city where she'd spent most
of her short life, but they returned to Nashville to live. Both parents were
eventually buried nearby.

National Cemetery on Tyson Street, adjoining Old Gray, juxtaposes
thousands of markers, commemorating soldiers from every U.S. conflict since
the Civil War, in no obvious order. In the foreground are graves of two Union
dead; in the next row are veterans from World Wars I and II. Other Civil
War graves are visible in the background, interspersed among 20th century
graves of veterans of conflicts as recent as Vietnam.

astonishing success in Knoxville business history, Cal Johnson
was born and raised a slave in downtown Knoxville. With money earned from
a brief stint as a post-Civil War gravedigger, he built a successful grocery,
then a chain of saloons, a racetrack, and a real-estate concern. By the turn
of the century, Cal Johnson was among Knoxville's wealthiest men and a
philanthropist, donating money for a black YMCA, as well as the Cal Johnson
Park. He died in 1925 at his large home on State Street, less than two blocks
from his birthplace. His family plot, enclosed by a partially damaged fence,
adjoins the Odd Fellows graveyard on Bethel.

inscribed in Hebrew to the memory of Isaac Copland, a successful
Knoxville businessman who died in 1925. Originally from Baltimore, Copland
had run a grocery here since the early 1880s. Many graves at this Jewish
cemetery on Keith are inscribed in Hebrew, often with the English translation
on the other side of the stone. Flowers are uncommon at Jewish gravesites;
instead, visitors are expected to leave a pebble on top of the grave they
visit. This is the second, and larger, of Knoxville's Jewish graveyards.
Several Jewish graves at the original plot just east of downtown are well
over 100 years old.

Rosalie Coxe was a young musician and novelist, author of several magazine
articles and books, including a popular Russian romance called The Embassy
Ball. A victim of Bright's disease, she died at her Kingston Pike home in
1906. She was only 42. Her husband, a wealthy coal tycoon, memorialized her
with this angel and cross here at Old Gray. This graveyard on lower Broadway,
established in the 1850s, bears the name of English poet Thomas Gray, author
of "Elegy Written in a Country Courtyard."
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="620_pic16.gif" WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="145" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">This military
marker is located, along with hundreds of other graves,
in a neglected corner of Old Crestview Cemetery, sometimes called Halltown,
near Keith Avenue, just over the ridge from New Gray. The great Jazz Age
singer-songwriter Ida Cox was originally buried near here. After the cemetery
company went out of business, many of these graves were moved elsewhere.

Fabled Fountain City</H1>
<P><STRONG>Where the ducks are friendly, the burgers are huge, and the community spirit is above average</STRONG>
<P><EM>by author</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>"I remember topping the hill as you come down Broadway, going down into the little valley that is Fountain City," relates one 24-year resident. "The leaves on the willows were just emerging, and there was a big, blue sky and fluffy, white clouds. The sun was sparkling off the steeples and cupolas of the churches." She knew, she says, that this was a place with a healthy and distinct sense of itself. This New Yorker decided then and there to raise her two children here.
<P>In 24 years, City Councilwoman Carlene Malone has not regretted it. She says moving to Fountain City was the best decision she's ever made, with the possible exception of marrying her husband.
<P>The spiritual and perhaps geological center of this moist valley is a duck pond shaped like a valentine heart. It's the residence of perhaps 20 ducks, some more bold than others, needing little in the way of eye contact to walk right up and introduce themselves. They have no fear. You are human and therefore an excellent source of nutrition.
<P>Perhaps intimidated by the ducks, some who visit the duck pond don't get out of their cars. They sit in cars alongside the park, reading paperbacks, speaking on cell phones. Almost every day, at least one person who shows up here pops the hood to do some auto maintenance.
<P>Some Farragut swimming pools are as big as this pond, but it's officially "Fountain City Lake." As if to prove it's a real lake, folks drop fishing lines in it. Here on a Thursday afternoon are five fishermen, including a dad and his son with a stick pole and a couple of old men who aren't paying much attention, speculating on why the afternoon sunlight hitting the spray of water from the fountain sometimes makes it appear to fly backwards. The most serious fisherman today is a sunburned, fortyish man who looks like Robert Shaw in Jaws. He's got two lines in the water.
<P>"There's all kinds of fish here," he says with professional authority. "Largemouth, smallmouth, bluegill, crappie, cats. Last year I caught a 31-pound cat." Today he's got two bass on the line, one maybe 15 inches long.
<P>"I'll let 'em go, let somebody else catch 'em," he says. "I don't like the taste of freshwater fish." For now, he's keeping them imprisoned on a leash for show.
<P>A grandmother who's been showing a brood of baby ducks to her toddler strolls over to induce the man to pull the two unfortunates out of the water for one more look. Boys ride around the pond on bikes. Up on the hill, a young man in a Vols jersey works on the engine of a Mercury sedan, listening to a rap song loudly repeating the one word we've decided not to print in this magazine. 
<P>In the middle of the pond is a spouting fountain that symbolizes the community's name. Over 34 years after annexation, this is Fountain City--but not necessarily Knoxville. Less than five miles out Broadway, the duck pond is closer to downtown Knoxville than Knoxville's Main Post Office is, closer than either of Knoxville's big malls--but Fountain City still seems like a different, distant place. 
<P>A dark stone memorial, the only thing legible at the duck pond, is "dedicated in memory and honor of all Fountain City veterans." That doesn't include Knoxville veterans or Knox County veterans. Just Fountain City ones. 
<P>It's not a remnant of pre-annexation days. It was dedicated only last year.
<H3>Growing Apart</H3>
<P>Fountain City wasn't separated at birth.
<P>John Adair is recalled as Fountain City's patriarch, remembered in distinctly Fountain City place names like Adair Drive, Adair Park, Adair Manor, etc. The Irish adventurer settled here around 1788. But Adair himself seems for all the world like a Knoxvillian. He was a county official at the Knoxville courthouse, a trustee for Blount College on Gay, an elder at the Presbyterian Church on State. For a guy who'd crossed the ocean to get here, four or five miles was no big deal. (In 1796 Adair became the only foreign-born member of the Constitutional Convention which formed Tennessee.) 
<P>But for many who followed Adair here, his old home was just far enough.
<P>A spot near Adair's home became known as the Fountain Head, where an underground stream emerged from some boulders and formed First Creek that flowed south and turned the mills that powered Knoxville's first industry. In the 1800s, the Fountainhead became known as a place to get away from the smoke and noise of industrializing Knoxville, especially for church retreats, ecumenical camp meetings, candle-lit vespers, not necessarily solemn affairs. In Knoxville, the Fountainhead developed a reputation as a place for falling in love. 
<P>Times changed, and in 1885 a group of capitalists built the extravagantly secular Fountain Head Hotel, a castle of three full stories, a dormered fourth floor and a tower, with running water fresh from the creek. In High Victorian Knoxville, the Fountain Head became known for its fine meals, breezy verandahs, a new pastime called golf, and Professor Guilliano's band, which played every evening at dusk. All that hot, sticky, coal-dusty Knoxvillians needed was a way to get there faster. In 1890, investors built a "dummy line," a train from one end of Broadway to the other, a silver dime one way, half an hour at a leisurely pace. They got a post office here about the same time, and called it Fountain City just because Tennessee already had a Fountainhead P.O. (in Sumner County).
<P>As if they needed to make it even more appealing, they built that pond, the Fountain City Lake, in 1891.
<P>It was hard to stay away from the place. A single week in 1893 witnessed a balloon ascension, fireworks, parachutes, and a speech by Fiddlin' Bob Taylor, the most popular politician, motivational speaker, and standup comic in the South. 
<P>An early promoter declared that Fountain City "will be a town where the saloon and whiskey store will never be seen. We intend to make it a great educational center, where the morals are as pure as the bracing atmosphere and life-giving water." As a whole, Fountain City hasn't strayed very far from those morals. 
<P>But in the early 20th century, the hotel eventually became a high-class sanitarium before it was destroyed by fire--as it seems all hotels were in those days--and the area around it rapidly became residential. 
<P>Future King of Country Music Roy Acuff grew up here, became a baseball star at Central High and, according to stories, learned to play the fiddle from an eccentric auto mechanic who ran a gas station on the north side of the park in the 1920s. An early country string band called Ridgel's Fountain Citians made some rare recordings in Knoxville in 1929. Recently, a disk jockey on North Carolina's WNCW played one of the band's cuts and remarked on the peculiarity of their name, apparently unaware of its origin.
<P>The place boomed in the middle of the 20th Century, almost purely as a residential area, quadrupling in population between 1930 and 1960, when there was talk of making Fountain City one of several new parts of Knoxville. 
<P>The addition of the word "city" back in 1890 to please the post office may have a lot to answer for. Unlike some other suburbs, including Old North Knoxville, which was once a city with a mayor of its own, Fountain City never incorporated. (Locals once claimed it was the largest unincorporated community east of the Mississippi, a claim mighty hard to disprove.) They did build their own water supply, but Fountain City never supported much industry or independent business of its own; that was a big part of its appeal. Politically, Fountain City was never really a town, never mind a city. Economically, it was always wholly dependent on Knoxville. Most of those who lived in Fountain City in the early '60s got their paychecks from Knoxville jobs.
<P>But when Knoxville annexed several suburbs in 1962--some, like West Hills, farther from Knoxville's nucleus than Fountain City was--Fountain City alone mourned. They held a mock funeral parade for their community, the Central High band providing the dirges. Some declared they'd never call themselves Knoxvillians. Even 34 years later, some residents insist on writing Fountain City, not Knoxville, as their return address. In fact, the word Knoxville is still rare up here. If not for the fire department, you might not see that word here at all. You'd think to these folks, Knoxville was just that high school down south that Central used to beat once a year.
<P>That may seem a little odd, considering how many prominent Knoxville politicians and city officials live up here: Malone, Mary Lou Horner, Jack Sharp, and County Executive Tommy Schumpert are just a few of the politically powerful municipal leaders who call Fountain City home. Fountain City apparently has more Knoxville politicos per capita than any other part of town--another surprise, considering that Fountain Citians say they feel neglected by the city in terms of funding projects.
<H3>Downtown</H3>
<P>At the spot where the old Knoxville train used to let out, there's still a pocket urban area, businesses two stories tall, close together with sidewalks. A newcomer might easily assume that this was, maybe still is, a town of its own. Lots of incorporated towns look like less. Old Hotel Street, at Broadway, still has the look of a tasteful resort, some old town in Colorado maybe, with small shops in two-story storefronts, close together, with colorful names: Yesterday's Fancy; Fountain City Creamery; The Bird and Fish Depot; The Trolley Shop. 
<P>Judged by the number of times the phrase "Fountain City" appears in names of businesses, this is the proudest community in Knoxville. Fountain City and Fountain Head appear in the names of no fewer than 30 businesses. Fountain City's only rival in the yellow pages is West Knoxville, which is several times larger. 
<P>Over and over, you hear residents and visitors alike compare it to Mayberry. An employee at Litton's prefers to compare it to another TV show. "Fountain City is the 'Northern Exposure' of Knoxville," he says.
<P>Litton's has become a major landmark in recent years. You can see the duck pond from its windows on Essary Road. Litton's burgers are famous, picked as Knoxville's best in more than one poll. But what makes Litton's remarkable in Knoxville is the fact that it uses its own community's culture and makes of it something genuine, original and very successful. 
<P>Here they have a sandwich called the Fountain City Club, and a Fountain City Onion Soup (the basic French Onion, but hold the cheese). There are well-stained hardwood floors, playfully surreal color chalk art behind the counter, framed raves on the walls, a huge blown-up portrait of the Central High Class of '42--and taped over the grill where you can see the chefs working hard, a wine list. 
<P>They also serve liquor and beer. If famously temperate Fountain City holds it against them, Litton's is not suffering for it. There's a rotary chalkboard out front with spaces for 48 waiting parties. It's not unusual, on a Friday night, for number 48 to be duly filled in. The place is packed at lunchtime and typically feeds all afternoon, even on weekdays.
<P>Maybe it's just the historical accident of the word "City" that makes Fountain Citians feel independent. Or maybe it's the steep hill that makes a separate valley of the Fountain City area, the incline called Sharp's Ridge. 
<P>Sharp's Ridge is the highest mountain in Knoxville. You can get up there surprisingly quickly and drive the Memorial Park road, less than two miles long. It's the origin of most of East Tennessee's radio and TV signals, as well as a notorious lovers' lane. From here, even Knoxville looks like a tiny hamlet at the foot of the Smokies. From the top of the ridge, Knoxville's another place, almost unrecognizable until you notice the Sunsphere, a shiny dandelion far off in that valley to the south. Here, better than you can anywhere else in town, you can see just how far three miles is.
<P>"I think the air is different" when you pass through Sharp's Gap, says insurance agent Richard Tumblin, who grew up here. (He recalls the not-so-distant days when it was so coal-smoke smoggy in Knoxville that blowing your nose would blacken your handkerchief.) Tumblin, president of the Fountain City Business and Professional Association, has long observed that Fountain City's more community-spirited than other parts of town.
<P>Sharp's Ridge on the South and Black Oak Ridge on the north seal in Fountain City's distinctive charms and distinctive adversities. Though drainage improvements have decreased the frequency and severity of floods, Fountain City has a greater problem with flooding and related problems like sinkholes and swampy spots than most of the city does. A flood two years ago floated boats in Harrill Hills. A year ago this month, the community was hit with a destructive tornado which destroyed or damaged hundreds of houses and felled the trees for which Cedar Lane was named. It's the flip side of isolation--locals grumble that one of Knoxville's most destructive natural disasters in recent years got relatively little media attention.
<H3>Fountain City Uber Alles</H3>
<P>Isolation works both ways. At the Fountain Head Barber and Style Shop, a Boomer-aged stylist is working on an older woman's weekly hairdo. The woman in the chair says she's been living in Fountain City for 44 years.
<P>"There are more rednecks in Halls," the old woman reports matter-of-factly, as if it's the sort of thing we could verify via census records. "We are very conservative," she adds. "We have high priorities: good home, good community, good churches."
<P>Out of the blue, she adds, "We don't have any black people here--but it's not racial. When a black person comes to the Baptist church, it doesn't upset me. But I wouldn't invite one to dinner." 
<P>Even though she's blurting out the usually unspoken rules by which most white Americans live their lives, it sounds inflammatory. The stylist is quick to distance herself from the remark. "And that's not racial?" she says. 
<P>"They've got their place and I have mine," the older woman counters. "That's not racial. It's racial to mistreat them." 
<P>Her assertion of racial homogeneity, for the record, is a small exaggeration. Across the street at Litton's as we speak are a few blacks both at work behind the cash register and seated, being served. At the 1990 census, more than 500 blacks lived in the Fountain City area, a number apparently on the rise. 
<P>The older woman and the younger one agree on one thing: Fountain City folks try to keep up with their neighbors, imitating each other's home improvements. They see a contrast even with other North Knoxvillians who live a couple miles south of Fountain City. As in many residential communities, the distinctions revolve around the high schools.
<P>The hairdresser says, "Central kids dress better, have good cars, expect to go to college. Fulton kids are gonna have a trade." 
<P>In several demographic categories, Fountain Citians and North Knoxvillians on the town side of Sharp's Ridge are nearly identical. Both are overwhelmingly white. Neither has a sizable population of immigrants, very low even compared to Knoxville as a whole. Their population densities are comparable, just over 2,000 per square mile. Both Fountain Citians and lower North Knoxvillians are a little older than the Knoxville average. Both have a tendency to stay put in the same house for decades. 
<P>But some statistics support the stylist's sweeping generalizations. People over 25 who live north of Sharp's Ridge are much more likely to be high-school graduates, much more likely to be college graduates, than people who live south of the ridge. Nearly a quarter of Fountain City's adult residents have college degrees. And, of course, they make much more money.
<P>The stylist, who actually lives south of the ridge, is amused at Fountain Citians' thriftiness. Some reacted when she raised her rates from $8 to $10. Some offer her one-quarter tips with an air of patrician magnanimity. 
<P>Carlene Malone calls that conservatism. A gas station attendant of her acquaintance recently got a job in Fountain City after years working in West Knoxville. "You know," he told her, "out west people don't ask what it costs. Here everybody counts their change."
<P>Malone says that Fountain City is "conservative in the sense that there's not a desire for a lot of razzle-dazzle. We want the basic services, peace and quiet, and big churches."
<P>They're conservative in several time-honored respects. Mary Lou Horner says the strength of her birthplace is its sturdy individualism. "We pay our taxes, and say leave us alone. We do things ourselves, take care of the lake, the park. We even built our own ball park."
<P>Even some of the old camp-meeting ethic clings on today. "We don't drink in front of each other here," says Richard Tumblin. "If we're going to do that, we need to sneak." Some younger folks complain that Fountain City lacks nightspots. Of the 69 business listed as either taverns or nightclubs in the Knoxville phone book, only two are in Fountain City. The North holds its own in liquor stores per capita; but as far as public drinking goes, this may be the driest region inside the city limits.
<P>However, the community gathering-spot role that bars fulfill in many communities is served ably by soberer establishments. Litton's is one, of course, as is the duck pond itself, and the ball park. A McDonald's parking lot becomes an informal hotrod show on weekends. Churches, of course, are a big part of Fountain City's sense of community, as is the Lions Club and the community center and park it supports. 
<P>This Monday may be Fountain City's finest hour: Honor Fountain City Day. Thousands attend each year on Memorial Day to witness politicians' speeches, music from the Central High bands, the recognition of a Mr. and Mrs. Fountain City, an elderly veteran reading unusual rhymes, and sundry (but sober) revelry. 
<P>The juggernaut behind that and other events like the yuletide Lighting of the Tree is an entity called Fountain City Town Hall, an unusually well-organized community organization that meets once a month, presents seminars on everything from crime prevention to zoning, offers citizens the opportunity to vent grievances, plans swell parties, and almost makes up for the fact that Fountain City never had a mayor and city council. Mary Lou Horner started Town Hall 24 years ago, and implies that not everything they do sits well with her. "When we started Town Hall, it was a very positive organization that worked with the business community," she says. "Without a strong business community, we won't have a strong residential community."
<P>"We've been accused of being anti-development, anti-business," says recent Town Hall chairman Garry Menendez. "But it's not that. We're pro-neighborhood."
<H3>Fountain City, R.F.D.</H3>
<P>Outside of these planned occasions, one of Carlene Malone's favorite gathering occasions is any afternoon at the Fountain City Creamery, right across Hotel Street from that park. (Like Litton's it's famous for its hamburgers.) She says she sat there eating a burger recently when a couple of Gresham Middle kids came in and ordered malteds. She'd never met them before, but they'd been talking about acquaintances injured in car accidents. She had a few things to add, and soon the two adolescents were sitting at Carlene's table.
<P>The owner asked, "Do you want what's left over?" and handed them each a metal shake-maker with the dregs of their malteds in the bottom. They slurped it up and carried on their conversation with their city councilwoman. As the boys left, the owner turned to Malone and said, "I bet you didn't expect company today."
<P>Lots of folks, including Fountain Citians, call Fountain City "cliquish," but Malone says she had no trouble fitting in here. Neither did Garry Menendez: "That's a reputation we've earned, but it's not true." He moved here from Somewhere Up North a dozen years ago, and soon found himself taking a leadership role at venerable Town Hall. On a recent volunteer project to improve part of the park, Menendez was surprised to learn that none of his fellow volunteer co-workers were native Tennesseans, but were originally from Michigan, Illinois, Pennsylvania. For some, it takes only a few years in the valley to earn your wings as a bona fide Fountain Citian.
<P>This old-fashioned, Mayberry-style community still has the potential to breed some interesting new, even trendy, attractions. Litton's, of course, is permanently trendy. And Marcus' Pizza started out in the Old City several years ago but moved to Fountain City. From its seemingly unlikely location--a '70s-style Tudor-suburban shopping center called Fountain Place--Marcus' Pizza developed a sudden reputation for lively and often progressive bluegrass, hailed by many as the best venue for indigenous music in the Knoxville area, packed on weekends with UT students and folks who wouldn't otherwise get away from the campus-downtown axis often. The music-publishing folks pulled rank on Marcus early this year and put a legal damper on live music there, but look for an encore soon.
<P>Six decades after homeboy Acuff left, live music still has a hold on the imagination of Fountain City, and not necessarily in the tradition of "Great Speckled Bird." The Fountainhead Conservatory, a boys' choir which sprang from the Fountain City Methodist Church, may be the most renowned choral group in the region and is more comfortable with old-time numbers like "Ave Maria." On their agenda is an audience with the pope (or, more accurately, an audience that includes the pope).
<H3>The Sun Also Rises</H3>
<P>As neighboring communities like Halls explode with population and development, Fountain City's population has held steady for the last 35 years or so at just over 20,000. City planners don't expect that figure to change much in our lifetime. "We don't appear to be growing," Carlene Malone admits. "But neither is Sequoyah Hills." When a Knoxville politician described Fountain City's population as "stagnant," Carlene Malone snapped, "The word is 'stable.' I'll show you how to spell it." 
<P>A local businesswoman is convinced that Fountain City is mostly old folks. Young folks, she says, don't care much for Fountain City. Nowadays, she says, people starting families want bigger houses than there are in Fountain City, like the mammoth manors popping up in new subdivisions in nearby Halls or farther out west. 
<P>There are indeed a lot of old folks in Fountain City, and there aren't a lot of new houses going up. But populations don't stay old forever. A changing of the guard has been under way for a decade or so. A glance at the Fountain City playground confirms what statistics show: Knoxville's population of children under five is growing fastest here just north of Fountain City, in what the MPC calls the North Sector. 
<P>Watching the kids swinging in the park, you wonder what words they learn to say first. Knoxville, Tennessee, America--or Fountain City.
