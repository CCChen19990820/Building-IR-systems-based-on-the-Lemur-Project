        qualified higher education expenses of the taxpayer for the  
        taxable year in which received.

the 3-year period ending on the date of acquisition of the   
principal residence to which this paragraph applies, and

        meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) solely by reason

        of the residence, the amount of the distribution may be  
        contributed to an individual retirement plan as provided in  
        subsection (d)(3)(A)(i) (determined by substituting `120  
        days' for `60 days' in such section), except that--

      `(1) a trust which is part of such plan shall not be treated  
    as failing to meet the requirements of section 401(a) or any  
    other provision of law solely by reason of such transfer (or

      `(2) such transfer shall not be treated as a prohibited  
    transaction for purposes of section 4975.

qualified transfer made during the taxable year.  
  `(b) Qualified Transfer: For purposes of this section--  
      `(1) In general: The term `qualified transfer' means a

    qualified transfer--  
          `(A) any assets transferred in a plan year on or before  
        the valuation date for such year (and any income allocable  
        thereto) shall, for purposes of section 412, be treated as  
        assets in the plan as of the valuation date for such year,  
        and  
          `(B) the plan shall be treated as having a net experience  
        loss under section 412(b)(2)(B)(iv) in an amount equal to  
        the amount of such transfer and for which amortization  
        charges begin for the first plan year after the plan year   
        in which such transfer occurs, except that such section  
        shall be applied to such amount by substituting `10 plan  
        years' for `5 plan years'.'

<font size=5><b>FREEDOM &amp; FAIRNESS RESTORATION ACT<br> 
OF 1995 (Flat Tax) - Summary <br> </font>
<font size=4>H.R. 2060, S. 1050<br></b></font>
<hr>   
(This analysis  is an excerpt from &quotA Side By Side Analysis   
of Alternative Tax System Proposals&quot; 
published  August 1, 1995 by <a href="/savers/legislation/blc.html">The Business 
Leadership Council</a>.)   
   <br>
<hr>
</center>
<b>Sponsors:</b> Mr. Armey and Mr. Shelby<br>   
   <p>
<b>Basic Principles:</b>  The plan is based on the principles set   
forth in &quot;The Flat Tax&quot; by Robert E. Hall and   
Alvin Rabushka (2nd Ed., 1995).  The plan has an individual   
wage tax and a business tax imposed on all   
forms of business which allows the deduction of &quot;business   
inputs&quot; but not taxes, fringe benefits, interest and dividends.   
   <p>
Unlike a value added tax, wages are deductible to the firm   
and the employee is taxed on his wages (after a   
generous standard deduction and dependent exemption).  The   
proposal would have a comprehensive   
consumption tax base.   
   <p>
<b>Rate Structure, Individuals:</b>  20 percent flat tax rate for   
1996, 17 percent thereafter on wages.   
   <p>
<b>Tax Base, Generally:</b>  Individual taxable income is defined   
as wages, retirement distributions and   
unemployment compensation less the standard deduction and   
the dependent exemptions.   
   <p>
<b>Interest, Dividends and Other Investment Income and Expense: 
</b>
Investment income is neither taxable   
to the recipient nor deductible to the payor.   
   <p>
<b>Municipal Bond Interest:</b> Municipal bond interest would not   
be taxable.   
   <p>
<b>Standard Deduction Family Living Allowance: </b> The standard   
deduction would be:   
   <p>
$21,400 for a joint return or surviving spouse;   <br>
$14,000 for a head of household;   <br>
$10,700 for a single person or married couple filing   
separately.   <br>
   <p>
<b>Personal Exemption:</b> None.   
   <p>
<b>Dependent Exemption:</b> $5,000 per dependent.   
   <p>
<b>Capital Gains:</b>  Not taxed on financial instruments.  Gross   
proceeds from real and personal property are   
included in income.  Basis existing prior to enactment of   
the flat tax is not deductible against gross   
revenue from the sale of property.   
   <p>
<b>Home Ownership:</b>  The home mortgage interest deduction is   
repealed.  Capital gains from the sale of a   
home would not be taxed.   
   <p>
<b>State and Local Taxes:</b>  State and local taxes are not   
deductible.   
   <p>
<b>Estate and Gift Taxes:</b>  The unified estate and gift tax is   
repealed.   
   <p>
<b>Pensions, IRAs, and Other Qualified Plans:</b>  Receipts from   
qualified plans by individuals would generally be taxable.   
   <p>
<b>Compensation (Wages & Salaries): </b> Wages would be taxable to   
the employee and deductible to the business.   
   <p>
<b>Charitable Contributions:</b>  Charitable contributions would   
not be deductible.   
   <p>
<b>Educational Expenses:</b>  Educational expenses would not be   
deductible.   
   <p>
<b>Savings, Generally:</b>  The return to savings would not be   
taxed.   
   <p>
<b>Inflation Indexing: </b> The dependent exemption and standard   
deduction are indexed for inflation.   
   <p>
<b>Social Security Benefits:</b>  Social Security benefits are   
exempt.

    declaration under paragraph (1) to the Congress-- 
          (A) TEMPORARY TAX REDUCTIONS-  
              (i) IN GENERAL- Effective for taxable years beginning 
            in the calendar year specified in such declaration-- 
  (I) the rates applicable to the first income bracket in the tax 
tables contained in section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
shall be reduced by a percentage (not to exceed 3 percent)  
specified in such declaration, and 
  (II) the amounts set fourth as tax in such tables shall be

              (ii) WITHHOLDING ADJUSTMENTS- The withholding tables 
            or procedures prescribed by the Secretary of the 
            Treasury or his delegate under section 3402(a) of such

full calendar year effect of such reduction is reflected through 
withholding reductions during the portion of the calendar year  
after such declaration. 
          (B) Temporary surtax where economic growth requirements 
        subsequently satisfied- 
              (i) IN GENERAL- Effective for taxable years beginning 
            in the first subsequent calendar year for which the 
            economic growth requirements of paragraph (3) are 
            satisfied-- 
  (I) each rate of tax in the tax tables contained in section 1 of 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be increased by the 
percentage determined under paragraph (4) for such year, except the 
tax rate for individuals with Adjusted Gross Income of less than 
$50,000 and taxpayers filing jointly with Adjusted Gross Income of 
less than $75,000 shall not exceed the rates established in the  
year prior to the temporary tax reduction, and

adjusted to reflect such rate increases. 
              (ii) WITHHOLDING ADJUSTMENTS- Effective for such

            procedures prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury 
            or his delegate under section 3402(a) of such Code  
            shall be modified to reflect the increase in tax rates 
            under clause (i). 
      (3) ECONOMIC GROWTH REQUIREMENTS- The economic growth 
    requirements of this paragraph are satisfied for any calendar 
    year if, before the beginning of such calendar year, the 
    President determines (and publishes such determination in the 
    Federal Register) that for such calendar year and the 
    immediately preceding calendar year-- 
          (A) economic growth as measured by the change in the real 
        Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to be greater

    contained in section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
    which the President estimates will result in an aggregate 
    increase in receipts under chapter 1 of such Code equal to the 
    aggregate decrease in receipts under such Code by reason of 
    subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) without increasing the tax 
    rate for individuals with Adjusted Gross Income of less than 
    $50,000 and taxpayers filing jointly with Adjusted Gross Income 
    of less than $75,000 above the rates established in the year 
    prior to the temporary tax reduction. Such percentage shall be 
    published in the Federal Register before the beginning of the 
    calendar year for which the economic requirements of paragraph 
    (2) are satisfied. 
SEC. 3. TREATMENT UNDER PAY-AS-YOU-GO PROCEDURES. 
  Any reduction or increase in receipts resulting from section 2 of 
this Act shall not be considered for any purpose under the Balanced

      (2) the Tax Code is an important element of our national 
    saving policy; 
      (3) the current Tax Code is irreparably flawed and should be 
    replaced with a new progressive system  which promotes saving 
    and investment, and thus more rapid economic growth, while 
    ensuring fairness through progressive taxation; 
      (4) all individuals at all income levels should be given a 
    fair opportunity to save, invest, and raise their standard of 
    living and that of their children; 
      (5) future economic growth requires a tax system that 
    facilitates successful competition in the global marketplace; 
      (6) the tax system of the United States must be as simple and 
    efficient as possible; and 
      (7) to ensure that national saving is increased, reform of  
    the tax system must not increase the Federal budget deficit. 
  (b) Main Features of USA Tax System:  
      (1) Replacement of old tax system: Chapter 1 of subtitle A 
    (related to income taxes) of the Code is repealed and replaced 
    for years beginning after 1995. 
      (2) New tax system: The USA Tax consists of-- 
          (A) a simplified tax collected from individuals, that for 
        years after 1995 replaces the income tax imposed on 
        individuals by section 1 of the Code, and 
          (B) a simplified tax collected from corporations and  
        other businesses, that for years after 1995 replaces the 
        income tax imposed on corporations by section 11 of the Code. 
      (3) USA tax on gross profits: Corporations and other 
    businesses pay tax on their annual gross profits from business 
    conducted in the United States, except that-- 
          (A) export revenues are excluded, and 
          (B) imports are taxed. 
      (4) USA tax on income: Individuals pay tax on their annual 
    income from wages, dividends, interest, and other financial 
    income (including sales of property), except that-- 
          (A) tax is deferred on income the consumption of which is 
        deferred and added to the national stock of savings, 
          (B) a portion of each family's income is exempt from tax, 
        and 
          (C) deductions are allowed for-- 
              (i) education costs, 
              (ii) religious, charitable, and other philanthropic 
            donations, and 
              (iii) home mortgage interest payments. 
      (5) Credit for fica payroll taxes paid: The amount of tax due 
    is reduced by the payroll tax that is-- 
          (A) in the case of an employee, withheld from wages, or 
          (B) in the case of a corporation or other business, paid 
        by the employer. 
  (c) Concepts and Structure of New Tax System:  
      (1) Guiding principles of the usa tax system: The USA Tax is 
    based on the following principles: 
          (A) National wealth and well-being depend on the work, 
        skill, and savings and investment of people. 
          (B) Businesses are people and their capital working 
        together. 
          (C) Capital makes people more productive. 
          (D) Everyone benefits from a growing stock of national 
        savings which in turn allows for a growing stock of  
        physical and human capital. 
          (E) Under the USA Tax, the deferral of taxation on 
        investments in physical and human capital represents an 
        investment by the Federal Government in the Nation's  
        capital stock and the Federal Government shares in the 
        return on its investment in the form of higher economic 
        output and revenues in the future. 
      (2) Single tax in 2 parts: The USA Tax is composed of a 
    business tax and an individual tax which are 2 parts of a  
    single tax system that subjects all income produced and  
    received to taxation once and only once. The 2 parts are as 
    follows: 
          (A) Business tax at the source of income: Tax is paid by 
        corporations and other businesses which produce and sell 
        goods and services that are-- 
              (i) the source of nearly all the gross domestic 
            product of the United States, and 
              (ii) the ultimate source of income received by 
            individuals. 
          (B) Individual tax on income received: Tax is paid by 
        individuals-- 
              (i) when they receive wages and salaries as 
            compensation for gross domestic product created by  
            their work, and 
              (ii) when they receive interest, dividends, and other 
            financial income as compensation for gross domestic 
            product created by their savings and investment. 
      (3) Saving and investment: The USA Tax allows people to save 
    and businesses to invest as follows: 
          (A) Fair opportunity for people to save:  
              (i) No prepayment of tax: When a person defers  
            receipt of income by adding it to the national stock of 
            savings-- 
  (I) a deduction is allowed for the amount saved, and 
  (II) tax is deferred. 
              (ii) Withdrawal of savings and earnings: When 
            withdrawn from savings, both the principal amount saved 
            and the earnings on savings are included in gross  
            income subject to tax. 
              (iii) Analogy to individual retirement accounts: The 
            deduction for saving is the equivalent of allowing a 
            deduction for the contribution a person makes to an 
            individual retirement account (IRA), except that-- 
  (I) savers have greater control and flexibility, 
  (II) no specially designated account is required, 
  (III) savings are not limited to retirement purposes, 
  (IV) the deduction for saving is unlimited in amount, and 
  (V) savings can be withdrawn at any time for any purpose. 
          (B) Fair opportunity for businesses to invest:  
              (i) No prepayment of tax: When a business invests in 
            plant and equipment-- 
  (I) a deduction is allowed for the cost, and 
  (II) tax is deferred. 
              (ii) Tax on earnings and recovery of cost: When 
            recovered out of business revenues, both the cost of  
            the investment and the earnings on the investment are 
            included in gross profit subject to tax. 
              (iii) Expensing: The deduction for investment is the 
            equivalent of allowing the cost of plant and equipment 
            to be expensed instead of depreciated. 
      (4) Fair opportunity to compete in the global marketplace:  
    The USA Tax serves the strategic interests of the United States 
    in international markets as follows: 
          (A) Border adjustable tax:  
              (i) American-made exports: Goods and services  
            produced in the United States can be sold into world 
            markets free of tax. 
              (ii) Foreign-made imports: Goods and services  
            imported into the United States bear a fair and 
            proportionate share of the tax burden in the United 
            States. 
              (iii) Leveling the international playing field:  
            Border adjustments for exports and imports are 
            consistent with international standards and practice. 
      (5) Simpler and more understandable tax: Compared to the 
    income tax it replaces, the USA Tax for individuals-- 
          (A) is written in a simpler, more understandable form, and 
          (B) contains only a few exemptions, deductions, and 
        credits. 
      (6) USA tax is revenue neutral: The USA Tax is designed to 
    neither increase nor decrease the total amount of tax paid and 
    collected under the current Code. 
      (7) Maintaining tax progressivity for individuals:  
          (A) Graduated tax: Like the tax imposed by section 1 of 
        the current Code, the USA Tax for individuals is a  
        graduated tax. 
          (B) Family living allowance: The USA Tax recognizes that 
        every family's budget includes necessities. The USA Tax 
        provides a family living allowance that exempts from 
        taxation the first dollars earned and spent to maintain a 
        basic standard of living. 
          (C) Individual tax burden by income level: The tax burden 
        across income classes ranging from low income to high  
        income is about the same as under the current Code. 
      (8) Business and individual portions of tax burden:  
          (A) Business portion of tax burden: Corporations and  
        other businesses pay about the same portion of the total  
        tax as under the current Code. 
          (B) Individual portion of tax burden: Individuals pay 
        about the same portion of the total tax as under the  
        current Code. 
      (9) Emphasizing personal independence and responsibility:  
          (A) Reinforcing a culture of work and thrift: Instead of 
        being solely a calculation of how much they must pay to the 
        government, the USA Tax converts the income tax into an 
        annual calculation of-- 
              (i) how much people produce and contribute to the 
            economy, 
              (ii) how much they take out of the economy, and 
              (iii) how much they save and put back into the  
            economy for their own and the nation's future. 
          (B) Greater control and responsibility: Because people  
        are allowed to defer tax on income through saving, they 
        have-- 
              (i) more control over their own income and taxes, 
              (ii) a greater ability to plan and provide for their 
            own future, and 
              (iii) a fair opportunity to do so. 
      (10) More opportunity for wage earners at lower income levels:  
          (A) Refundable credit for employee payroll tax: The  
        amount of the payroll tax paid or withheld under the Code 
        from an employee's wages (and paid into the Social Security 
        and Hospital Insurance Trust Funds) is-- 
              (i) credited against the employee's income tax, and 
              (ii) refunded to the employee to the extent in excess 
            of the employee's income tax. 
          (B) Refundable income tax credit for the working poor:  
        The USA Tax-- 
              (i) increases the credit allowed by section 32 of the 
            current Code, and 
              (ii) concentrates the credit on families with children. 
          (C) No effect on trust fund or benefits: The income tax 
        credit allowed for payroll taxes deposited in the Social 
        Security Trust Fund does not-- 
              (i) reduce the amount in such fund, or 
              (ii) reduce the payment of any person's benefits from 
            the fund.

      `(4) the investment in any business entity, the purpose of 
    which is to hold collectibles for appreciation.

section 72 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall apply for 
purposes of determining the basis of assets withdrawn in the case  
of payments under annuities, retirement plans, life insurance 
contracts, and any other arrangements for which the taxpayer 
acquired rights in part by payment of amounts that were included in 
income and not deducted when paid. 
`SEC. 55. NET NONEXEMPT BORROWING. 
  `(a) Net Nonexempt Borrowing: A taxpayer's `net nonexempt 
borrowing' for a taxable year equals the excess, if any, of-- 
      `(1) the taxpayer's nonexempt debt as of the end of the

      `(2) Debt to acquire a consumer durable: So much of 
    indebtedness directly related and traceable to the acquisition

      `(1) In general: In the case of a brokerage account or a bank 
    account, for a taxable year--

              `(i) Taxpayer withdrawals from the account during the 
            taxable year, over 
              `(ii) Taxpayer deposits to the account during the 
            taxable year. 
          `(B) `Addition to savings' means the excess, if any, of-- 
              `(i) Taxpayer deposits to the account during the 
            taxable year, over 
              `(ii) Taxpayer withdrawals from the account during  
            the taxable year. 
          `(C) Any earnings on assets in the account (including 
        interest, dividends, and the proceeds from the sale of  
        stock or other savings assets) that are credited to the 
        account shall not be taken into account in determining  
        gross income or additions to saving, except to the extent 
        taken into account in subparagraph (A) or (B) because such 
        earnings are withdrawn. 
          `(D) For purposes of this paragraph, if savings assets  
        are transferred to a brokerage account, such assets shall 
        not be treated as `deposits' to the accounts. 
      `(2) Basis:  
          `(A) Initial basis: A taxpayer's initial basis in a bank 
        or brokerage account held on January 1, 1996, shall be the 
        sum of the basis of the assets held in the account except-- 
              `(i) assets whose basis is amortized pursuant to 
            section 12 shall have no basis in such assets for these 
            purposes, and 
              `(ii) a bank account shall have no basis if the 
            taxpayer elects to treat the basis of his bank account 
            as an addition to his general basis account in 
            accordance with section 57(d). 
          `(B) Additions to basis: The basis in a bank account or 
        brokerage account shall increase by the amount of-- 
              `(i) interest on tax-exempt bonds credited to the 
            account, and 
              `(ii) the transferor's basis in any savings assets 
            transferred to a brokerage account. 
          `(C) Reductions in basis: Basis in a bank account or 
        brokerage account will be reduced by the amount by which  
        the withdrawal for the year (as determined under paragraph 
        (1)) exceeds the taxable withdrawal for the year (as 
        determined under paragraph (3)). 
          `(D) Basis in closed account: If a taxpayer closes a bank 
        account or a brokerage account and the taxpayer has basis 
        remaining in the account after application of subparagraph 
        (C) for the year of withdrawal, the remaining basis shall  
        be added to the taxpayer's general basis account. 
      `(3) Taxable withdrawals: The basis in an account shall be 
    allocated to the last withdrawals from a bank account or 
    brokerage account. Accordingly, if a taxpayer has a withdrawal 
    (as defined in paragraph (1)) from a bank account or a  
    brokerage account in a taxable year, the amount of such 
    withdrawal that constitutes a taxable withdrawal equals the 
    excess of-- 
          `(A) the amount of the withdrawal, over 
          `(B) the amount by which the basis of the account exceeds 
        the value of the account as of the end of taxable year. 
      `(4) Definitions: For purposes of this subsection-- 
          `(A) Bank account: `Bank account' means a checking, 
        savings, or money market account with a bank, credit union, 
        or other financial institution. 
          `(B) Brokerage account: `Brokerage account' means an 
        account with a brokerage firm which holds savings assets on 
        behalf of the taxpayer and reports transactions with  
        respect to such assets in periodical reports to the taxpayer. 
          `(C) Value of an account:  
              `(i) Value of bank account: The value of a bank 
            account is the cash held in the account as of the last 
            day of the taxable year. 
              `(ii) Value of a brokerage account: The value of a 
            brokerage account is the sum of the amount of cash in 
            any cash account or account whose value is regularly 
            denominated in dollar value, plus the cost of other 
            savings assets held in the account. 
              `(iii) Cost of savings asset: The cost of a savings 
            asset held in a brokerage account-- 
  `(I) on January 1, 1996, is the taxpayer's basis in such asset if 
he basis is reported to the brokerage firm in accordance with 
regulations prescribed by the Secretary, 
  `(II) transferred to the brokerage account after January 1, 1996, 
is the taxpayer's basis in the savings asset at the time of transfer, 
  `(III) acquired through the brokerage account, is the cost of  
such asset (less commissions), and 
  `(IV) in all other cases, the fair market value of the asset as 
determined by the brokerage firm. 
          `(D) Withdrawals from an account: Withdrawals from an 
        account include service charges, brokerage commissions, and 
        other fees charged to the account. 
      `(5) Provisions not applicable to some accounts: The 
    provisions of this subsection shall not apply to a bank account 
    or a brokerage account-- 
          `(A) if a taxpayer elects in accordance with regulations 
        prescribed by the Secretary not to have the provisions 
        apply, or 
          `(B) the bank, brokerage firm, or other financial 
        institution with which the account is held fails to provide 
        annual reports to the taxpayer in sufficient detail for the 
        taxpayer to make the determinations required by this 
        subsection. 
  `(b) Rollover of Basis in Certain Cases: If a taxpayer sells a 
savings asset in which it has a basis and within 2 weeks of the  
sale acquires 1 or more savings assets, the taxpayer may elect to-- 
      `(1) roll over its basis from the asset sold to the asset 
    purchased, 
      `(2) not treat so much of the proceeds of the sale of the 
    savings asset as equals the cost of new savings assets as a 
    withdrawal, and 
      `(3) not treat so much of the cost of the new savings asset  
    as equals the proceeds of the sale of the old savings asset as 
    new savings. 
Such election shall be made on the tax return for the taxable year 
of the sale of the old asset. 
  `(c) Rules for Gratuitous Transfers:  
      `(1) No withdrawal for donor: If a donor transfers a savings 
    asset other than cash (or a bank account or other similar 
    account with a balance denominated in cash) to a donee, whether 
    during the donor's life or by reason of the donor's death, the 
    donor shall not be treated as withdrawing the amount so 
    transferred. 
      `(2) Anti-abuse rule: Under regulations to be prescribed by 
    the Secretary, paragraph (1) shall not apply to any inter vivos 
    transfer if the transfer is made primarily to effect a transfer 
    of tax liability to a taxpayer in a lower tax bracket. The 
    Secretary may presume that a transfer was made primarily to 
    effect a transfer of tax liability if the savings asset (or any 
    savings asset acquired with the proceeds of such asset) is  
    sold, disposed of, or withdrawn within the 3-year period 
    following the transfer and the proceeds are used to pay  
    expenses that the transferor is likely to have paid but for the 
    transfer. 
      `(3) Transfer of cash or bank account: If a donor transfers 
    cash (or a bank account or other similar account with a balance 
    denominated in cash) to a donee, the donor will be treated as 
    having withdrawn the amount so transferred. The donee will be 
    treated as making an addition to savings to the extent that the 
    donee makes an addition to savings with cash or maintains the 
    account so transferred. 
`SEC. 57. GENERAL BASIS ACCOUNT. 
  `(a) Explanation: The general basis account is intended to allow 
he taxpayer to withdraw from savings an amount of savings equal to 
he amount which had previously been included in income because the 
amount was saved before the Unlimited Savings Allowance became 
applicable or because no savings deduction was allowed because the 
savings was treated as made with borrowed funds, tax-exempt income, 
or from withdrawals of previously taxed savings. 
  `(b) In General: Each taxpayer shall have a general basis  
account, which shall start with a balance of zero, which balance 
shall-- 
      `(1) in the case of a taxpayer with net savings in a taxable 
    year, be increased as of the end of the taxable year by the 
    lesser of-- 
          `(A) the taxpayer's net savings for the taxable year; or 
          `(B) nontaxable sources of funds (as defined in section 
        52(a)(2)(B)), 
      `(2) in the case of a taxpayer with net withdrawals for the 
    taxable year, decreased as of the end of the taxable year, but 
    not below zero, by the amount of net withdrawals, 
      `(3) in the case of the sale of a savings asset by a taxpayer 
    for an amount less than its basis, increased by the amount by 
    which the basis exceeds the proceeds of the sale, and 
      `(4) be increased as provided in subsections (c) and (d). 
  `(c) Special Rules To Ensure Benefit of Savings Deduction Upon 
Sale of Principal Residence: 
      `(1) Explanation: If a taxpayer who is planning to retire or 
    acquire a smaller principal residence sells a principal 
    residence in which the taxpayer has a significant basis and  
    then saves most of the proceeds of the sale, the taxpayer may 
    not have sufficient income in the year to fully absorb the 
    savings deduction attributable to the new savings. This 
    provision allows the taxpayer to use the portion of the savings 
    deduction that would otherwise not be used to reduce future 
    deferred income. 
      `(2) Rule: A taxpayer who sells his principal residence in a 
    taxable year may increase his general basis account by the 
    portion of the saved basis of the principal residence that the 
    taxpayer determines that he cannot use in the taxable year. In 
    his tax return for the year of the sale, the taxpayer shall 
    elect what portion of the saved basis to treat as savings in 
    determining his Unlimited Savings Allowance 
and what portion to add to his general basis account as of the end 
of that year. Once a return is filed in which an election is made, 
he election shall be irrevocable for that taxable year (except if 
he amount of saved basis is reduced by a subsequent purchase of a 
replacement principal residence). 
      `(3) Saved basis: The `saved basis' from the sale of a 
    taxpayer's principal residence shall equal the least of-- 
          `(A) the Unlimited Savings Allowance determined in 
        accordance with section 50 (but without regard to this 
        subsection) for the taxable year of the sale of the 
        taxpayer's principal residence, 
          `(B) the net proceeds from the sale of the residence 
        (including any proceeds applied to pay off indebtedness but 
        excluding proceeds that were applied to pay transactional 
        costs, such as brokerage fees and transfer taxes), or 
          `(C) the excess of the taxpayer's basis in the principal 
        residence over the taxpayer's basis in any new principal 
        residence to which the residence rollover rule of section  
        76 applies. 
  `(d) Election To Increase General Basis Account by Bank Account 
Balance: A taxpayer may elect to increase his general basis account 
by the balance in his bank accounts as of January 1, 1996. Such 
election shall be made on the taxpayer's return for the period 
covering such date. If the election is made, the taxpayer shall  
have no basis in his bank accounts. 
  `(e) Other Adjustments: See section 56(a)(2)(D) (relating to bank 
accounts and brokerage accounts that are terminated with basis) and 
section 78, relating to losses. 
`SEC. 58. ANTI-ABUSE RULES. 
  `(a) Borrowing To Generate Deduction:  
      `(1) General rule: A taxpayer shall not be permitted to treat 
    as a savings asset (and the Secretary shall have authority to 
    deny such treatment if claimed by the taxpayer) if such savings 
    asset was acquired with funds borrowed for the purpose of 
    increasing the taxpayer's Unlimited Savings Allowance or 
    decreasing the taxpayer's deferred income. 
      `(2) Ordering: Subsection (a) shall be applied after the net 
    savings calculation in section 50 and shall apply only to the 
    extent that that section does not itself deny the taxpayer a 
    benefit from the borrowing. 
      `(3) Exempt borrowing: Subsection (a) shall apply to any 
    exempt borrowing to the extent that the borrowing is directly 
    traceable to the acquisition of a savings asset or such 
    borrowing is transitory. 
  `(b) Conversion to Cash: Any cash in excess of $250 held by a 
axpayer on January 1, 1996, shall be treated as a savings asset.  
If such cash is used to acquire a savings asset, it will be treated 
as withdrawn and then used to acquire a savings asset, so that no 
net deduction arises. 
  `(c) Borrowing in Lieu of Withdrawing: If the Secretary  
determines that because of the Unlimited Savings Allowance and 
deferred income rules, taxpayers are borrowing against their  
savings to consume rather than withdrawing their savings, the 
Secretary shall have authority to prescribe rules that treat 
indebtedness that is secured by interests in savings assets as 
amounts withdrawn. 
   `SUBCHAPTER C--BASIS, BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS AND NONRECOGNITION 
                            TRANSACTIONS 
`SEC. 71. EFFECT OF BASIS. 
  `(a) In General: The amount of gross income to be recognized on 
he sale or exchange of property equals the excess of-- 
      `(1) the net proceeds from the sale, over 
      `(2) the taxpayer's adjusted basis, if any, in the property. 
  `(b) Nonrecognition Transaction: Subsection (a) shall not apply  
o nonrecognition transactions described in this chapter. 
  `(c) Savings Assets: Subchapter B generally governs the treatment 
of the basis of savings assets. 
`SEC. 72. BASIS. 
  `(a) Basis, Sale, or Exchange: Except to the extent inconsistent 
with provisions of this chapter, adjusted basis and the existence  
of a sale or exchange shall be determined in accordance with 
principles applicable under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
  `(b) Definition of Basis: For purposes of this chapter, `basis' 
means the adjusted basis of property. The adjusted basis of  
property is generally its cost, as adjusted for actions or 
transactions that increase or decrease the basis of property.  
Except as provided in section 12 (relating to the 3-year 
amortization of basis in savings assets) and section 73 (relating  
o business entities and basis in business entities), the  
axpayer's adjusted basis on January 1, 1996, in an asset acquired 
before that date, shall be its adjusted basis as of December 31, 
1995, as determined under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
  `(c) Effect of Treating Asset Purchase as Savings: If the  
purchase of a savings asset is treated in whole or part as an 
addition to savings, the taxpayer shall have no basis in the amount 
so treated. 
`SEC. 73. BASIS IN BUSINESS ENTITIES. 
  `(a) Partnership Interest:  
      `(1) Initial basis in old partnerships: A partner's basis in  
    a partnership interest as of January 1, 1996, equals-- 
          `(A) the partner's basis in the partnership as of the end 
        of the taxable year ending on December 31, 1995, minus 
          `(B) the amount of the partner's share of the  
        indebtedness of the partnership taken into account in 
        determining such basis. 
      `(2) Negative basis: If the amount determined under paragraph 
    (1) is negative, the taxpayer has a negative basis in the 
    partnership and such negative basis shall increase the gain on 
    the sale or disposition of the partnership interest (except to 
    the extent such negative basis is taken into account in 
    determining the transition basis deduction). 
      `(3) Adjustment to basis:  
          `(A) In general: A partner shall have no basis in a 
        partnership formed on or after January 1, 1996, and shall 
        not adjust his basis in any partnership interest after such 
        date by reason of any-- 
              `(i) contribution to the partnership, 
              `(ii) distribution from the partnership, or 
              `(iii) any change in the partner's share of the 
            partnership's indebtedness. 
          `(B) Exceptions: A partner shall have basis or an  
        addition to basis resulting from-- 
              `(i) contributions of cash or land to a land company 
            (as provided in section 114), or 
              `(ii) a contribution of personal-use property to a 
            partnership (as provided in section 111). 
      `(4) Partnership: For purposes of this subsection, 
    `partnership' includes a corporation that was treated as an S 
    corporation under such Code. 
  `(b) Proprietorship:  
      `(1) Old proprietorship: A proprietor's basis in any business 
    activity conducted before January 1, 1996, which is treated as  
    a business activity as of such date equals-- 
          `(A) the proprietor's adjusted basis in the assets of  
        such business entity as of the end of the taxable year 
        ending on December 31, 1995, minus 
          `(B) the balance of any indebtedness the interest on  
        which the proprietor had treated as business interest under 
        section 163(h)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
      `(2) Negative basis: If the amount determined under paragraph 
    (1) is negative, the proprietor has a negative basis in the 
    proprietorship and such negative basis shall increase the gain 
    on the sale or disposition of the entity (except to the extent 
    such negative basis is taken into account in determining the 
    transition basis deduction). 
      `(3) Adjustment to basis:  
          `(A) In general: A taxpayer shall have no basis in a 
        business entity (as defined in section 151) formed on or 
        after January 1, 1996, and shall not adjust his basis in  
        any such entity by reason of any-- 
              `(i) contribution to the business entity, or 
              `(ii) distribution from the business entity. 
          `(B) Exceptions: A proprietor shall have basis or an 
        addition to basis resulting from-- 
              `(i) contributions of cash or land to a land company 
            (as provided in section 114), 
              `(ii) a contribution of personal-use property to a 
            business entity (as provided in section 111). 
      `(4) Proprietorship: `Proprietorship' includes-- 
          `(A) any family business that is not a partnership, and 
          `(B) any business activity conducted by a taxpayer other 
        than as an employee if such activity constitutes a business 
        entity. 
  `(c) Anti-Avoidance Rule: If partnership distributions to an 
individual partner in its taxable year or taxable years ending in 
1995 exceeds the partner's distributive share of income for such 
period, the amount of such excess distribution shall be treated as  
a cash distribution to the partner on January 1, 1996, and shall  
not reduce the partner's basis in his partnership interest. 
`SEC. 74. GRATUITOUS TRANSFERS. 
  `(a) In General: If after December 31, 1995, a taxpayer receives  
a savings asset or any other property by gift, inheritance, or  
other gratuitous transfer, the taxpayer's basis in the property 
shall be the lesser of-- 
      `(1) the fair market value of the property at the time of 
    transfer, or 
      `(2) the transferee's basis in the property at the time of 
    transfer. 
  `(b) Proof Required: A taxpayer's basis in a savings asset 
received by gift, inheritance, or other gratuitous transfer shall  
be presumed to be zero unless the taxpayer can demonstrate to the 
satisfaction of the Secretary the basis claimed by the taxpayer. 
`SEC. 75. TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING BUSINESS ENTITIES. 
  `(a) Cash Capital Contributions, Business Interests Acquired:  
      `(1) A taxpayer shall have no basis by reason of cash 
    contributed to the capital of a business on or after January 1, 
    1996, except as provided in section 114 (relating to land 
    companies). A contribution of property acquired for purposes of 
    contribution shall be treated as a contribution of cash equal  
    to the amount of property contributed. 
      `(2) A taxpayer shall have no basis in stock or other  
    interest in a business entity purchased on or after January 1, 
    1996, except as provided in section 77 (relating to certain 
    exchanges) or in the case of an acquisition of a land company. 
  `(b) Contributions of Property:  
      `(1) In general: If a taxpayer contributes personal-use

`SEC. 76. ROLLOVER ON RESIDENCE SALE. 
  `(a) Nonrecognition of Gain: If property (in this section called 
`old residence') used by the taxpayer as his principal residence is 
sold by him and, within a period beginning 2 years before the date 
of such sale and ending 2 years after such date, property (in this 
section called `new residence') is purchased and used by the 
axpayer as his principal residence, gain (if any) from such sale 
shall be recognized only to the extent that the taxpayer's adjusted 
sales price (as defined in subsection (b)) of the old residence 
exceeds the taxpayer's cost of purchasing the new residence. 
  `(b) Adjusted Sales Price Defined:  
      `(1) In general: For purposes of this section, the `adjusted 
    sales price' means the amount realized, reduced by the  
    aggregate of the expenses for work performed on the old 
    residence in order to assist in its sale. 
      `(2) Limitations: The reduction provided in paragraph (1) 
    applies only to expenses-- 
          `(A) for work performed during the 90-day period ending  
        on the day on which the contract to sell the old residence 
        is entered into; 
          `(B) which are paid on or before the 30th day after the 
        date of the sale of the old residence; and 
          `(C) which are-- 
              `(i) not allowable as deductions in computing taxable 
            income, and 
              `(ii) not taken into account in computing the amount 
            realized from the sale of the old residence. 
  `(c) Rules for Application of Section: For purposes of this 
section: 
      `(1) An exchange by the taxpayer of his residence for other 
    property shall be treated as a sale of such residence, and the 
    acquisition of a residence on the exchange of property shall be 
    treated as a purchase of such residence. 
      `(2) A residence any part of which was constructed or 
    reconstructed by the taxpayer shall be treated as purchased by 
    the taxpayer. In determining the taxpayer's cost of purchasing  
    a residence, there shall be included only so much of his cost  
    as is attributable to the acquisition, construction, 
    reconstruction, and improvements made which are properly 
    chargeable to capital account, during the period specified in 
    subsection (a). 
      `(3) If a residence is purchased by the taxpayer before the 
    date of his sale of the old residence, the purchased residence 
    shall not be treated as his new residence if sold or otherwise 
    disposed of by him before the date of the sale of the old 
    residence. 
      `(4) If the taxpayer, during the period described in 
    subsection (a), purchases more than 1 residence which is used  
    by him as his principal residence at some time within 2 years 
    after the date of the sale of the old residence, only the last 
    of such residences so used by him after the date of such sale 
    shall constitute the new residence. If a principal residence is 
    sold in a sale to which subsection (d)(2) applies within 2  
    years after the sale of the old residence, for purposes of 
    applying the preceding sentence with respect to the old 
    residence, the principal residence so sold shall be treated as 
    the last residence used during such 2-year period. 
  `(d) Limitation:  
      `(1) In general: Subsection (a) shall not apply with respect 
    to the sale of the taxpayer's residence if within 2 years  
    before the date of such sale the taxpayer sold at a gain other 
    property used by him as his principal residence, and any part  
    of such gain was not recognized by reason of subsection (a). 
      `(2) Subsequent sale connected with commencing work at new 
    place: Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to the sale  
    of the taxpayer's residence if such sale was in connection with 
    the commencement of work by the taxpayer as an employee or as a 
    self-employed individual at a new principal place of work. 
  `(e) Basis of New Residence: Where the purchase of a new  
residence results, under subsection (a), in the nonrecognition of 
gain on the sale of an old residence, in determining the adjusted 
basis of the new residence as of any time following the sale of the 
old residence, the adjustments to basis shall include a reduction  
by an amount equal to the amount of the gain not so recognized on 
he sale of the old residence. For this purpose, the amount of the 
gain not so recognized on the sale of the old residence includes 
only so much of such gain as is not recognized by reason of the 
cost, up to such time, of purchasing the new residence.

purposes of this chapter, references to property used by the 
axpayer as his principal residence, and references to the  
residence of a taxpayer, shall include stock held by a 
enant-stockholder in a cooperative housing corporation if-- 
      `(1) in the case of stock sold, the house or apartment which 
    the taxpayer was entitled to occupy 
as such stockholder was used by him as his principal residence, and 
      `(2) in the case of stock purchased, the taxpayer used as his 
    principal residence the house or apartment which he was  
    entitled to occupy as such stockholder.

          `(A) the taxpayer's adjusted sales price of the old 
        residence is the adjusted sales price (of the taxpayer, or 
        of the taxpayer and his spouse) of the old residence, and 
          `(B) the taxpayer's cost of purchasing the new residence 
        is the cost (to the taxpayer, his spouse, or both) of 
        purchasing the new residence (whether held by the taxpayer, 
        his spouse, or the taxpayer and his spouse); and 
      `(2) so much of the gain on the sale of the old residence as 
    is not recognized solely by reason of this subsection, and so 
    much of the adjustment under subsection (e) to the basis of the 
    new residence as results solely from this subsection shall be 
    allocated between the taxpayer and his spouse as provided in 
    such regulations. 
This subsection shall apply only if the old residence and the new 
residence are each used by the taxpayer and his spouse as their 
principal residence. In case the taxpayer and his spouse do not

be determined under this section without regard to the rules 
provided in this subsection. For purposes of this subsection,

                `(2) Limitation based on number of individuals: In the case  
              of any foster home, difficulty of care payments for any period 
              to which such payments relate shall not be excludable from

              his official duties outside the United States. 
          Paragraph (2) shall not apply to any punitive damages in connection

                  by reason of a combat-related injury, or 
                    `(D) on application therefore, he would be entitled to 
                  receive disability compensation from the Veterans' 
                  Administration.

                `(4) Amount excluded to be not less than veterans' disability

USA TAX - Summary<br></font>
<font size=4>S.722<br> 
</b></font>
<hr>
(This analysis is an excerpt from &quot;A Side By Side Analysis Of Alternative Tax System Proposals&quot;  
published August 1, 1995 by <a href="/savers/legislation/blc.html">The Business 
Leadership Council</a>.)  
  </center>
<hr>
<b>Sponsors:</b> Mr. Domenici and Mr. Nunn  
  <p>
<b>Basic Principles:</b>  The bill imposes a steeply graduated consumed 
income tax on individuals.  It imposes   
a subtraction method value added tax on business.  The proposal would have a fairly comprehensive   
consumption tax base but would retain a reduced mortgage interest deduction, a charitable deduction and   
enact a deduction for higher educational expenses.  The proposal would provide a credit to employers and   
employees for FICA taxes paid and an earned income tax credit.  The proposal would have a consumption   
tax base, but the exceptions are significant.  
  <p>
<b>Rate Structure, Individuals: </b> Different tax tables apply for each of 
the years 1996 to 1999, inclusive.  For all years, the top rate is 40 
percent of taxable income.  The 1996 tax tables are: <br> 
  <p>
For married filing jointly and surviving spouses:  <br>
<p>  
$0-$5,399 :     19%  <br>
$5,400 to $24,000 :    $1,026 plus 27%  <br>
Over $24,000 :           $6,048 plus 40%  <br>
  <p>
For heads of household:  
 <p> 
$0-$4,749 :    19%  <br>
$4,750 to $21,100 :   $903 plus 27%  <br>
Over $21,100 :          $5,317 plus 40%  <br>
  <p>
For unmarried individuals:  
  <p>
$0-$3,199 :   19% <br> 
$3,200 to $14,400 :   $608 plus 27%  <br>
Over $14,400 :          $3,632 plus 40%  <br>
  <p>
For married couples filing separately:  
  <p>
$0-$2,699 :   19%  <br>
$2,700 to $12,000 :   $513 plus 27%  <br>
Over $12,000 :          $3,024 plus 40%  <br>
  <p>
<b>Tax Base, Generally:</b>  The individual tax base would include 
compensation,  most fringe benefits,   
dividends, interest, rents, royalties and other capital income, capital gains and certain other income.    
Gifts, municipal bond interest and certain other income would be excluded from the tax base.  Mortgage   
interest on acquisition indebtedness, certain higher education expense and certain charitable contributions   
would be deductible.  Net savings would generally be deductible.  Net dissavings would generally be   
taxable.  
  <p>
<b>Interest, Dividends and Other Investment Income and Expense:</b>  
Interest, royalties, dividends, annuity   
payments, income from life insurance, endowment contracts, distributive share of partnership income (or   
loss) from intangible property and similar investment income would be included in gross income and   
subject to tax.  However, if the income was reinvested (in the sense that the taxpayer increased net   
savings), the taxpayer would receive a deduction and the tax would be deferred.  
  <p>
<b>Municipal Bond Interest:</b>  Municipal bond interest would not be 
taxable.  
  <p>
<b>Standard Deduction Family Living Allowance:</b>  The family living 
allowance (equivalent of a standard   deduction) would be:  
  <p>
$7,400 for a joint return or a surviving spouse;<br>  
$5,400 for a head of household;  <br>
$4,400 for a single person;  <br>
$3,700 for a married couple filing separately.<br>  
  <p>
<b>Personal Exemption:</b>  $2,550 per person.  
  <p>
<b>Dependent Exemption:</b>  $2,550 per dependent.  
  <p>
<b>Capital Gains:</b>  Included in gross income.  However, if the income was 
reinvested (in the sense that the   
taxpayer increased net savings), the taxpayer would receive a deduction and the tax would be deferred.  
  <p>
<b>Home Ownership:</b>  The home mortgage interest deduction is curtailed 
but retained.  Only acquisition   
indebtedness (but not home equity loan) interest would be deductible.  Tax-free rollover of primary   
residence retained.  Capital gains from the sale of a primary residence are taxed.  However, if the proceeds   
were saved, the tax would be deferred.  
  <p>
<b>State and Local Taxes: </b> Generally not deductible.  
  <p>
<b>Estate and Gift Taxes:</b>  The unified estate and gift tax is retained.  
  <p>
<b>Pensions, IRAs and Other Qualified Plans:</b>  All existing rules 
relating to pensions and qualified plans   
are repealed.  Net savings are deductible and the tax deferred until the taxpayer has net dissavings.   
  <p>
<b>Compensation (Wages & Salaries):</b>  Compensation would be taxable to 
individuals.  Compensation   would not be deductible to businesses.  
  <p>
<b>Charitable Contributions:</b>  Charitable deductions would generally be 
allowed up to 50 percent of a   taxpayer’s adjusted gross income.  
  <p>
<b>Educational Expenses: </b> A deduction of up to $2,000 per year per 
student for certain higher educational   expenses is allowed.  
  <p>
<b>Savings, Generally:</b>  The return to savings would be taxed unless 
saved.  The taxpayer would be afforded   
a deduction equal to his net savings.  Generally, net savings is the excess, if any, of additions to savings   
over taxable withdrawals from savings.  If taxable withdrawals exceed additions to savings, the net   
withdrawal is included in the taxpayer’s taxable income.  Savings are broadly defined to include most   
financial assets but exclude collectibles.  
  <p>
<b>Inflation Indexing:</b>  The family living allowance, personal exemptions 
and tax brackets are indexed for   inflation.  
  <p>
<b>Social Security Benefits:</b>  Social Security benefits are fully taxable.

 104th CONGRESS  
 1st Session  
 To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to encourage capital  
 formation through reductions in taxes on capital gains, and for  
 other purposes.  
                  IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES  
               June 22 (legislative day, June 19), 1995  
 Mr. Hatch (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Faircloth)   
     introduced the following bill; which was read twice and   
     referred to the Committee on Finance  
                                A BILL  
 To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to encourage capital  
 formation through reductions in taxes on capital gains, and for  
 other purposes.  
   Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the  
 United States of America in Congress assembled,  
 SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; AMENDMENT OF 1986 CODE.  
   (a) Short Title: This Act may be cited as the `Capital Formation  
 Act of 1995'.  
   (b)  Amendment of 1986 Code: Except as otherwise expressly  
 provided, whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal is expressed  
 in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other  
 provision, the reference shall be considered to be made to a   
 section or other provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  
                     TITLE I--CAPITAL GAINS REFORM  
     SUBTITLE A--CAPITAL GAINS DEDUCTION FOR TAXPAYERS OTHER THAN  
                             CORPORATIONS  
 SEC. 101. CAPITAL GAINS DEDUCTION.  
   (a) In General: Part I of subchapter P of chapter 1 (relating to  
 treatment of capital gains) is amended by redesignating section   
 1202 as section 1203 and by inserting after section 1201 the  
 following new section:  
 `SEC. 1202. CAPITAL GAINS DEDUCTION.  
   `(a) General Rule: If for any taxable year a taxpayer other than   
 a corporation has a net capital gain, 50 percent of such gain shall  
 be a deduction from gross income.  
   `(b) Estates and Trusts: In the case of an estate or trust, the  
 deduction shall be computed by excluding the portion (if any) of   
 the gains for the taxable year from sales or exchanges of capital  
 assets which, under sections 652 and 662 (relating to inclusions of  
 amounts in gross income of beneficiaries of trusts), is includible

 exchange of capital assets.  
   `(c) Coordination With Treatment of Capital Gain Under Limitation  
 on Investment Interest: For purposes of this section, the net

    such Code is hereby repealed.  
      (2) Employer reversions permitted without plan termination:  
    Section 420 of such Code is amended to read as follows:  
`SEC. 420. TRANSFERS OF EXCESS PENSION ASSETS.  
  `(a) In General: If there is a qualified transfer of any excess  
pension assets of a defined benefit plan (other than a   
multiemployer plan) to an employer--  
      `(1) a trust which is part of such plan shall not be treated  
    as failing to meet the requirements of section 401(a) or any  
    other provision of law solely by reason of such transfer (or   
    any other action authorized under this section), and  
      `(2) such transfer shall not be treated as a prohibited  
    transaction for purposes of section 4975.  
The gross income of the employer shall include the amount of any  
qualified transfer made during the taxable year.  
  `(b) Qualified Transfer: For purposes of this section--  
      `(1) In general: The term `qualified transfer' means a  
    transfer--  
          `(A) of excess pension assets of a defined benefit plan   
        to the employer, and  
          `(B) with respect to which the vesting requirements of  
        subsection (c) are met in connection with the plan.  
      `(2) Only 1 transfer per year: No more than 1 transfer with  
    respect to any plan during a taxable year may be treated as a  
    qualified transfer for purposes of this section.  
  `(c) Vesting Requirements of Plans Transferring Assets: The  
vesting requirements of this subsection are met if the plan   
provides that the accrued pension benefits of any participant or  
beneficiary under the plan become nonforfeitable in the same manner  
which would be required if the plan had terminated immediately  
before the qualified transfer (or in the case of a participant who  
separated during the 1-year period ending on the date of the  
transfer, immediately before such separation).  
  `(d) Definition and Special Rule: For purposes of this section--  
      `(1) Excess pension assets: The term `excess pension assets'  
    means the excess (if any) of--  
          `(A) the amount determined under section   
        412(c)(7)(A)(ii), over  
          `(B) the greater of--  
              `(i) the amount determined under section  
            412(c)(7)(A)(i), or  
              `(ii) 125 percent of current liability (as defined in  
            section 412(c)(7)(B)).  
    The determination under this paragraph shall be made as of the  
    most recent valuation date of the plan preceding the qualified  
    transfer.  
      `(2) Coordination with section 412: In the case of a   
    qualified transfer--  
          `(A) any assets transferred in a plan year on or before  
        the valuation date for such year (and any income allocable  
        thereto) shall, for purposes of section 412, be treated as  
        assets in the plan as of the valuation date for such year,  
        and  
          `(B) the plan shall be treated as having a net experience  
        loss under section 412(b)(2)(B)(iv) in an amount equal to  
        the amount of such transfer and for which amortization  
        charges begin for the first plan year after the plan year   
        in which such transfer occurs, except that such section  
        shall be applied to such amount by substituting `10 plan  
        years' for `5 plan years'.'  
SEC. 104. REPEAL OF ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX.  
  Part VI of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code  
of 1986 is hereby repealed.  
SEC. 105. REPEAL OF CREDITS.

of 1986 is hereby repealed.

  (a) Repeal of Estate and Gift Taxes:   
      (1) In general: Subtitle B of the Internal Revenue Code of  
    1986 is hereby repealed.  
      (2) Effective date: The repeal made by paragraph (1) shall  
    apply to the estates of decedents dying, and gifts and  
    generation-skipping transfers made, after December 31, 1995.

      (1) In general: Except as provided in paragraph (2), chapter   
    1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is hereby repealed.  
      (2) Exceptions: Paragraph (1) shall not apply to--

        this Act,  
          (B) those provisions of chapter 1 of such Code which are  
        necessary for determining whether or not--  
              (i) retirement distributions are includible in the  
            gross income of employees, or  
              (ii) an organization is exempt from tax under such  
            chapter, and  
          (C) subchapter D of such chapter 1 (relating to deferred

  (a) In General: It shall not be in order in the House of  
Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill, joint  
resolution, amendment thereto, or conference report thereon that  
includes any provision that--  
      (1) increases any Federal income tax rate,

      (3) reduces the standard deduction, or  
      (4) provides any exclusion, deduction, credit or other   
    benefit which results in a reduction in Federal revenues.  
  (b) Waiver or Suspension: This section may be waived or suspended  
in the House of Representatives or  
the Senate only by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the  
Members, duly chosen and sworn.

<h3>LETTER TO THE COMMISSION</h3>
<blockquote>
<hr>

<B>FOREWORD</B>
<P>
<B>TO THE MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON ECONOMIC GROWTH
AND TAX REFORM</B></center>
<P>
<B>&quot;Taxation without representation is tyranny.&quot;</B>
 Those are the words that helped to ignite the American revolution
over two centuries ago.
<p>
As we approach the 21st century, the crescendo
for tax reform continues to build, year after year, election after
election.  Americans have looked at a tax system constantly increasing
in both rates and complexity, and concluded that taxation with
representation wasn't so good either.
<p>
The current tax system is indefensible.  It is overly complex, burdensome, and severely
limits economic opportunity for all Americans.
<p>
We made clear on the very first day of the 104th Congress that our top priority
would be to change the status quo and to bring fundamental change
to America.  And we agreed that there is no status quo that needs
more fundamental changing than our tax system.
<p>
We envision:
<ul><P>
<li> A tax system that is fairer, flatter, and simpler.
<P>
<li> A tax system that promotes, rather than punishes, job creation.
<P>
<li> A tax system that eliminates unnecessary paperwork burdens on
America's businesses.
<P>
<li> A tax system that recognizes the fact that our families are
performing the most important work of our society.
<P>
<li> A tax system that provides incentives for Americans who save
for the future in order to build a better life for themselves
and their families.
<P>
<li> A tax system that allows Americans, especially the middle-class,
to keep more of what they earn, but that raises enough money to
fund a leaner, more efficient federal government.
<P>
<li> A tax system that allows Americans to compute their taxes easily,
without the need for a lawyer, an accountant - or both.
</ul><p>
To help make this vision a reality, we named Jack Kemp, one of America's
most innovative thinkers on economic policy, to head the National
Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform --  a commission that
included thirteen more outstanding Americans.
<p>
The entire commission worked diligently for the past several months, holding public
hearings in eight cities, while constantly thinking about how
to create a better tax system. Their final report is guaranteed
to stimulate this important national dialogue.  It will surely
serve as a catalyst for congressional hearings and debate.  We
hope that it will also trigger conversations around kitchen tables,
water coolers, and in town hall meetings across the country.
<P>
We invite all those who read this report to write us with your thoughts
on its recommendations and conclusions, and to share with us other
suggestions on how we can create a tax system that promotes economic
growth and opportunity for all Americans.

<title>Unleashing America's Potential -- Preface -- TRC</title>
<body><center><img src="/taxcom/fr-head.gif" alt="TRC:  Unleashing America's Potential"><br><font size="-1"><a href="/taxcom/reptoc.html">Table of Contents</a> | <a href="/taxcom/">TRC Home</a> | <a href="mailto:arnettgm@heritage.org">Feedback</a></font><P></center>

<h3>A NEW LEVEL OF THINKING</h3>
<blockquote><hr>
<P>
<B>PREFACE</B></center>
&quot;They act like all that money is born in Washington, D.C.&quot;  Perhaps no comment has better 
summarized the problem
with our nation's capital than this observation by Ed Zorinsky,
the late Democratic Senator from Nebraska.  And nowhere is this
governmental conceit expressed more destructively than in the
workings and effects of our Internal Revenue Code.
<p>
Many previous attempts at tax reform have been marred by the inside-the-beltway
assumption that the wealth of the nation belongs to its government.
 This position has perpetuated what could be called the &quot;tin-cup
syndrome&quot; - an environment in which the political competition
over scarce resources replaces the economic competition that produces
growth, creates jobs, spurs innovation and productivity.  As a
consequence, the tax code has over the years become increasingly
politicized, and is seen less as a simple tool for raising revenue
than as an instrument for social and economic engineering. In
turn, this has spawned a virtual industry of tax specialists and
special interest lobbyists, while exponentially increasing the
complexity of the code.
<p>
The National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform set out with a different set of 
assumptions, beginning with the belief that the purpose of the tax code is to raise money
while leaving citizens as free as possible to pursue the American
dream. Our charge from Senate Leader Dole and Speaker Gingrich
was clear:  Listen first and learn from the American people. 
We listened to ordinary taxpayers in hearings around the country.
 What we heard was a great deal of frustration, concern, and,
yes, anger with the current system.  Our hope has been to channel
those frustrations into a set of concrete principles and recommendations
that any new tax reform legislation must follow if it is to meet
the needs and expectations of the American people.
<p>
From June until September 1995, we heard from a cross-section of American taxpayers
in Boston, Omaha, Charlotte, Palo Alto, south-central Los Angeles,
Harlem, Cleveland, and Washington, D.C.  We listened to and learned
from family farmers and high-tech entrepreneurs, small businessmen
and women, medium-sized and large manufacturers, governors and
mayors, congressmen and senators, leading economists and local
activists.
<p>
Unlike previous &quot;reform&quot; commissions, our
activities were financed without a dime from the American taxpayer.
 Expenses were met through private contributions from more than
1,500 donors.  The fourteen commissioners received no compensation
for the long hours and hard work, save the tremendous reward of
knowing their sacrifices would help shape American history.  This
is an extraordinary group of American citizens who have demonstrated
through untold hours of hearings, deliberations, and study their
dedication to chart a course that will lead to a better America
for their children and grandchildren.  We believe we have set
that course.
<p>
In 1941, in a famous essay for Life magazine, Henry
Luce anticipated that the 20th century would be remembered as
the American Century.  The decades and events that followed -
the defeat of Nazi Germany, the collapse of Communism, the expansion
of American influence abroad - bore this prediction out.  Today,
many Americans fear they see that era of American preeminence
slipping away.  The optimism and boundlessness that have always
defined America are seen by some as fond but faded relics to be
quietly folded away.
<p>
This report reflects the firm conviction that America can do better.  None of the members of this commission
would have accepted this challenge if we did not believe in the
possibility of real progress and real reform. 
<p>
Albert Einstein observed that &quot;the problems of today cannot be solved at
the same level of thinking on which they were created.&quot; 
We have concluded that the complex tax code of the 20th century
is poorly suited for dealing with the complex world of the 21st.
 The vision outlined in the following pages cannot be realized
by simply rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic we call our
current tax code. A brand new tax code, modeled on the principles
and recommendations proposed in this report, can chart the economic
waters ahead and launch our country on its voyage toward the next
American century.

<h3>SETTING THE EAGLE FREE</h3><br>
<HR>

<P>
<B>INTRODUCTION</B>
</center><p><blockquote><blockquote>
<I>&quot;In short, it is a paradoxical truth
that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low,
and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is
to cut the rates now...The purpose of cutting taxes now is not
to incur a budget deficit, but to achieve the more prosperous,
expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus.&quot;</I>
<P>
John F. Kennedy<BR>
Economic Club of New York<BR>
December 14, 1962</blockquote>
<P>
These words of President Kennedy were a great inspiration to me as the tax reform movement was 
launched in the early 1980s with the Kemp/Roth tax cut.  Kennedy's vision and
courage can serve as examples for all Americans as we struggle
to make this nation better for our children and grandchildren.
 His remarks from the Economic Club of New York ring as true today
as they did in 1962. 
<p>
 At the first meeting of our commission back in June, I held up a blank sheet of paper and said, &quot;This
is what we start with.&quot;  That was our charge: Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich appointed the
National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform to study
the current tax code, listen to the suggestions and ideas of people
from around the country, and submit to Congress our recommendations
for comprehensive reform.  
<P>
A very diverse and dedicated group of 14 people, with the help of an invaluable, overworked, and
underpaid staff, set out to design an entirely new tax system
for America's 21st century; one which would promise a booming
economy, promote job creation, and ensure the greatest possible
opportunity for all Americans to work, save, invest, and reach
their potential.  We operated under the premise that an economic
growth rate of 2.5% is unacceptable to the American people.
<p>
This commission was empowered not merely to offer superficial reforms,
to trim a rate here and close a loophole there, but to begin with
a <I>tabula rasa</I> and map out a totally new tax structure for
America's next century.  We also wanted to help inform the whole
world, particularly the emerging democracies, that the goal of
tax policy is raising revenue, not redistribution of wealth. 
<p>
Our nation has arrived at a unique moment in history.  With the
passing of the Cold War, we are standing at the edge of a new
millennium with extraordinary possibilities.  Our country is poised
to help lead the world into a new era of economic growth fueled
by an information-age technological revolution that can yield
unparalleled expansion in jobs, productivity, innovation, and
prosperity.  We must embrace this opportunity and challenge. 
However, such an embrace will prove difficult, perhaps impossible,
if we remain saddled with our current tax code.  The current system
is indefensible: it is riddled with special interest tax breaks,
and it overtaxes both labor and capital.  We must construct a
tax system that reflects our highest values and unleashes our
greatest potential.
<p>
  The comments and concerns we heard from the
American people over the last several months, coupled with a systematic
review of the current tax code, helped us establish certain principles
to guide us to our conclusions.  Surely, a tax code which is simple
and fair must generate sufficient revenue so that the federal
government may carry out its legitimate tasks.  Second, it must
not place a tax burden on those members of society least able
to bear one.  And, perhaps most important of all, it must not
restrict the innovative and entrepreneurial capacities of Americans
upon which rising living standards and our general prosperity
so greatly depend.  Our proposals are in keeping with these principles.
<p>
Wildly excessive and unjust taxes have locked away access to capital
and credit necessary for lower-income Americans to launch the
next generation of entrepreneurship.  Today, sadly, we see the
American people's sense of dynamism and hope, their ability to
strive and compete diminished by a tax code which penalizes success,
retards investment, and sends capital fleeing overseas.  The commission
is united in the belief that only a pro-growth tax code can restore
America's confidence at home and her greatness abroad.  We want
a tax code and an overall economy that will liberate the American
dream and remove the barriers to upward social and economic mobility.
 The American ethos of entrepreneurship and optimism made America
great once before.  We believe these proposals will bolster that
ethos again and help restore integrity and honesty to our system.
<p>
The author John Gardner has observed that there are many contributing
factors to the rise of civilization - accidents of resources,
geography, and military power.  But whatever other ingredients
comprise the greatness of nations, he writes, &quot;There occurs
at breathtaking moments in history an exhilarating burst of energy
and motivation, of hope and zest and imagination, and a severing
of the bonds that normally hold in check the full release of human
possibilities.  A door is opened, and the caged eagle soars.&quot;
 That eagle, the symbol of our nation, represents the creative
spirit, talents, and aspirations of the American people.  The
charge of this commission and the intent of our recommendations
is to open the door and help set that eagle in all of us free.

<title>Unleashing America's Potential -- Imagine An America -- TRC</title>

<h3>IMAGINE AN AMERICA WITH A PRO-GROWTH, PRO-FAMILY TAX CODE</h3><br>
<blockquote><HR>
</center>
<P>
<I><B>The National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform
recommends to the Congress and to the President of the United
States that the current Internal Revenue Code be repealed in its
entirety.
<p>
The present system is beyond repair --  it is impossibly
complex,  outrageously expensive, overly intrusive, economically
destructive, and manifestly unfair. 
<p>
It is time to replace this failed system with a new simplified tax system for the 21st century:
a single low rate, taxing income only once with a generous personal
exemption and full deductibility of the payroll tax for America's
working men and women. 
<p>
This system will reduce the tax burden on middle-income people and will help remove the barriers that 
keep low-income Americans from reaching their fullest potential.
<p>
These changes, once in place, should be sealed with a guarantee of long-term
stability, requiring a two-thirds vote of the U.S. Congress to
raise the rate.
<p>
This new system is predicated on a commitment to expanding growth and opportunity. We believe the 
changes we
propose will help double the rate of economic growth. 
<p>
A  stronger economy will  create more jobs, raise family incomes, expand ownership
and entrepreneurship, and ensure greater opportunity for our children
and grandchildren.   It will also produce additional revenues
for balancing the budget and reducing the burden of national debt.</B></I>
<P>
The principles and recommendations contained in this report comprise
the &quot;Tax Test&quot; - the standard to which any new tax system
must be held.  We ask that Congress not pass nor the President
sign any tax legislation that fails to pass this test.  And we
encourage the public to use the goals and guidelines we offer
as a road map through the coming national debate on tax reform.
<p>
Our aim: to introduce a new system of taxation that brings out
the best in the American character, that plays to our strengths
and not our weaknesses, that speaks to our hopes and not our fears.
 <B>Our recommendations are based on a vision of America that
places the individual -- not the government -- at the center of
society: </B> 
<P><ul>
<li> We believe that government does not create opportunity; citizens
do, if government will get out of their way.  
<P>
<li> We believe that government is not the engine of economic growth;
it is, more frequently, the monkey wrench in the machine. 
<P>
<li> We believe that taxpayers' earnings and savings -- their property 
-- are not assets on loan from the government.  The government
is power on loan from the people.
</ul><p>
One of the most serious shortcomings of previous attempts at tax reform has been the inability of average
Americans to make their voices heard above the chorus of special
interests. We have tried a radically different approach:  Listening
to the people first.
<p>
In his first debate with Stephen Douglas, Abraham Lincoln remarked that &quot;with public sentiment, 
nothing can fail; without it nothing can succeed.&quot;  We believe that
any major legislative attempt to replace the current tax code
will falter unless it is first preceded by a national debate on
what the new system should look like. 
<p>
Many previous attempts to reform public policy have failed to achieve their aims  because
they substituted closed meetings for democratic dialogue, focusing
too much on expert analysis and too little on citizens' concerns.
By including the public in the deliberations over tax reform,
this commission seeks to build broad-based consensus behind a
new tax system for America's next millennium.
<p>
It was with this spirit that the commission held cross-country public hearings
-- from the historic home of the Boston tea-party to the heart
of south-central L.A.  At every hearing in every city, we asked
people to tell us what they saw as the problems with the current
system and the goals any reform plan should achieve.  
<P><ul>
<li> In Omaha, farmers pleaded for simpler filing and the freedom
to pass family farms on to their children without fear of federal
confiscation. 
<P>
<li> In the Silicon Valley, high-tech entrepreneurs told of the countless
ideas conceived but never born because of a scarcity of investment
capital. 
<P>
<li> In south-central Los Angeles, small business-owners voiced frustrations
at not being able to expand or hire new workers because of a tax
bite that eats away their profits. 
<P>
<li> And in Harlem, inner-city entrepreneurs expressed both bitterness
and bewilderment at a tax code which sucked revenues out of their
neighborhoods while preventing investment from flowing in.
</ul><p>
In our nation's capital, we heard from elected officials in both the
House and the Senate who have for many years been leaders in tax
reform.  Because of their tireless public service, tax reform
is a priority issue on the nation's agenda.
<p>
We also heard from many of the finest economists in the
country who shared their knowledge and research with us at every
hearing.
<p>
After our hearings, we held a series of working sessions
to analyze what we had heard and to begin discussing our recommendations
for change. During one of our working sessions, the commissioners
put aside the charts and graphs for a moment, stepped back, and
tried to imagine what kind of world they would like America's
next generation to grow up in.  We were asked to think about how
replacing the tax code might help bring that world about:
<P><ul>
<li> Imagine an America enjoying a decade of economic growth at nearly
twice the present rate -- creating jobs, expanding opportunities,
and lifting living standards for all. 
<P>
<li> Imagine an America in which more dreams born in basements and
garages grow into multi-million dollar businesses because abundant
capital seeks out good ideas, and entrepreneurs and investors
are confident that their risk-taking will be rewarded, not punished.
 
<P>
<li> Imagine an America where it is easier to get a job than to get
on welfare, and where our inner cities share in America's growth
and prosperity.  Imagine these neighborhoods ringing out, not
with sirens in the night, but with the sounds of new storefronts
being opened and new businesses being built.
<P>
<li> Imagine an America where home ownership and higher education
are within the reach of every American so that each citizen owns
a stake in the system and shares a common interest and responsibility
for its future. 
<P>
<li> Imagine an America where young couples aren't asked to take
a tax hit in order to exchange their marriage vows, and where
young families can save for their future without being punished
for their thrift.
<P>
<li> Imagine an America where Americans have enough to give, not
just to and through their government, but to their churches, synagogues,
mosques, their charities, and neighbors in need.
<P>
<li> Imagine an America where the I.R.S. becomes the &quot;TPA&quot;
-- a Taxpayer Protection Agency -- to ensure that no one pays more
than is owed.  Imagine a customer-friendly approach to raising
revenue, based on a belief in the basic honesty of the American
people, that treats them with dignity and respect.
</ul><p>
<I><B>We believe that replacing our tax system with one that is simpler and fairer
can help to make these American dreams come true.</B></I> 
<p>
America was not founded on envy or resentment. The American idea was never
to keep everyone at the same mean level, but to give everyone
the chance to rise as high as his or her effort, initiative and
God-given talent would allow.  It was a promise of equal opportunity,
not of end results: the confidence that whatever you aspired to
become -- be it artist, inventor, or entrepreneur -- you could make
it happen here. 
<p>
As the country pursues this change, how we transition
from the existing bankrupt system to the new system will be important.
 Complicated issues will arise.  Nonetheless, we are confident
that the Congress and the President will solve these transitions
in order to bring about this new tax system.  Dramatic change
never is easy, and complicated issues will arise in the transition.
 But change we must, confident that, with the leadership of the
Congress and the president, the American can-do spirit will prevail.
<p>
A new tax system, as envisioned in the following pages of this
report, can take a first step toward renewing that sense of hope
and possibility by unleashing a cascade of benefits, beginning
with greater economic growth, lower interest rates, and expanded
job opportunities for working Americans.
<p>
In this spirit, we invite the American people and their elected leaders from both political
parties to use the Tax Test as a checklist as they move forward
in replacing the current tax code.  We urge the Congress and the
President to base any new legislation on the principles and recommendations
submitted in this report.  Furthermore, we urge President Clinton
to appoint a presidential task force or commission to bring the
recommendations offered by this congressionally appointed commission
to the next level of public debate.

<title>Unleashing America's Potential -- Boiling Point --TRC</title>
<body><center><img src="/taxcom/fr-head.gif" alt="TRC:  Unleashing America's Potential"><br><font size="-1"><a href="/taxcom/reptoc.html">Table of Contents</a> | <a href="/taxcom/">TRC Home</a> | <a href="mailto:arnettgm@heritage.org">Feedback</a></font><P></center>
<center>

<h3>AT THE BOILING POINT</h3>
<blockquote>
<HR></center>
<p>
&quot;My grandmother used to tell me the folk tale of the frog,&quot;
recounted Commissioner Herman Cain of his childhood in Atlanta,
Georgia.  &quot;If you put a frog in a pot of hot water, he would
jump right out.  But if you put him in a pot of cool water and
gradually turned up the heat, he wouldn't notice the rising temperature
and would eventually boil to death.&quot;
<p>
The American taxpayer is in hot water. Escalating marginal tax rates, increasing complexity,
and advancing intrusiveness have created a system that has reached
the boiling point. Over the years, Americans have surrendered
more and more of their freedom to higher taxes.  The result has
not been to enhance economic security or to close the gulf between
rich and poor.  Instead, it has led to fewer jobs, slow economic
growth, diminished hope and opportunity, an erosion of trust and
confidence in government, and an ebbing of the American spirit
of enterprise. It is a history that echoes James Madison's warning
that &quot;there are more instances of the abridgment of the freedom
of the people by gradual and silent encroachments...than by violent
and sudden usurpation.&quot; 
<p>
The time has passed for incremental reform.  The problems with the current system have grown too deeply
entrenched to be solved with quick fixes and cosmetic repairs.
<p>
<b>We believe the current tax code cannot be revised, should not
be reinvented, and must not be retained.  Therefore, the commission
is unanimous: It is time to throw out the seven-million-word mess
of tax laws and regulations and begin anew.</b>
<p>
Marc Negri of Santa Rosa, California, wrote to tell us that, &quot;The current system
is so wrong and such a disincentive to the everyday worker that
it cannot be saved.&quot;  Lawrence Madsen of Mills, Wyoming,
prepares peoples' taxes for a living, and yet wrote: &quot;I am
so disgusted with the [system] that I must urge you to completely
abolish the Internal Revenue Code and start over.&quot;  A couple
from Astor, Florida, was even more blunt: &quot;The current tax
structure is way out of date with the real world, too complicated
with too many loopholes.  We say dump it!&quot;
<p>
Americans' eagerness for real change reflects in part their frustration with a system
that in the past forty years has seen 31 &quot;significant&quot;
reforms and an astounding 400 additional &quot;revisions&quot;
through public laws .   And yet the tax code is more complex,
more costly, and more economically destructive than ever. This
is the story of how we got here.
<P>
<B>THE ROAD TO TAX OPPRESSION</B><br>
<p>
The <I>New York Times</I>, in a 1909 editorial opposing the very first income tax, predicted:
&quot;When men get in the habit of helping themselves to the property
of others, they cannot easily be cured of it.&quot;  The history
of our tax code, in economic terms, mirrors the course of most
addictions: advancing dependence, diminished returns, and deteriorating
health of the afflicted.
<p>
Supporters of the Sixteenth Amendment
touted the income tax as the rich man's burden - forcing &quot;the
Carnegies, the Vanderbilts, the Morgans, and the Rockefellers&quot;
to pay while sparing the middle class from pain.  Indeed, after
the income tax was enacted in 1913, fewer than two percent of
American families were required to file a tax return.  Rates ranged
from 1 to 7 percent - with the highest rate applying only to Americans
who had the equivalent of $7.7 million in income in today's terms.
<p>
The rates did not stay that low for long. In 1916 the top rate
doubled.  A year later, on the eve of America's entry into World
War I, it soared to 67 percent.  With the Second World War, the
rate was raised to 94 percent. In the 1950s the top rate remained
at the sky high level of more than 90 percent.  President Kennedy
initiated legislation that cut the top rate to 70 percent, but
it was not until the Reagan growth years that the top rate was
lowered dramatically to 28 percent.  Under the current administration,
the rate has resumed its ascent, with combined federal taxes pushing
the top rate above 40 percent, including Medicare taxes and phase-outs.
<p>
With every attempt by politicians to &quot;soak the rich,&quot; the
water mark has risen on the middle class.  Author Frank Chodorov
has summed up the incremental march of encroaching taxation: &quot;At
first it was the incomes of corporations, then of rich citizens,
then of well-provided widows and opulent workers, and finally
the wealth of housemaids and the tips of waitresses.&quot;  Congress
expanded the income tax into the ranks of the middle class for
the same reason Willie Sutton robbed banks: that's where the money
is.  
<p>
This shift was mainly achieved by gradually multiplying the
number of taxpayers required to file income tax returns and by
raising average tax rates on ordinary citizens.  Until World War
II, the average tax rate (that is, the total tax paid divided
by income) on a family with a 1991 income of $50,000 never rose
above 4 percent.  Since World War II, it has never fallen below
14 percent.  
<p>
Marginal rates on the middle class have risen even
more dramatically. Marginal rates are the &quot;tax bracket&quot;
rates that apply to any extra dollar of income -- such as raises,
overtime,  bonuses, or a second family income.  The marginal middle
class tax rate never rose above 8 percent prior to World War II.
 Since then, it has never fallen below 22 percent, rising as high
as 33 percent during the high-inflation, bracket creep years of
the 1970s.
<p>
Today, there are three principal defects of our income
tax system that must be fixed immediately.
<P><ul>
<li> <B>Economically Destructive:</B>  Steeply graduated tax rates
on both labor and capital destroy jobs, penalize saving and investment,
and punish personal efforts to get ahead through hard work.
<P>
<li> <B>Impossibly Complex:</B>  The mind-boggling complexity of
the current tax code imposes an unacceptable burden on taxpayers
and a huge cost on the economy. 
<P>
<li> <B>Overly Intrusive:</B>  The vast enforcement powers conferred
on the I.R.S. are increasingly seen as infringements of privacy
and personal freedom. 
</ul><P>
<B>ECONOMICALLY DESTRUCTIVE</B>
<p>
In the famous Supreme Court case, <I>McCulloch v. Maryland</I>, Chief Justice Marshall wrote: 
&quot;The power to tax involves the power to destroy.&quot;  Some of the
ways in which the current tax code destroys our economic vitality
include:
<P><ul>
<li> High marginal tax rates that weaken the link between effort
and reward, depress productivity, and kill jobs.
<P>
<li> Multiple layers of taxation on work, saving, and investment
that dry up new capital for investment.
<P>
<li> Capital gains taxes that act as a barrier to capital formation
- preventing the flow of  investment to new enterprises and would-be
entrepreneurs.
<P>
<li> An &quot;alternative minimum tax&quot; that imposes immense
compliance costs on businesses, sapping resources that could otherwise
be put to constructive use.
<P>
<li> Double-taxation of corporate income which shrinks business investment
and encourages companies to take on extra debt.
<P>
<li> Estate and gift taxes that force families to sell their businesses
or family farms. 
</ul><p>
A fundamental principle of economics is that
the more you tax something, the less you get of it.  And if you
tax success, you get less success. The current confiscatory system
begs the questions: Why work harder if each extra dollar earns
you less?  Why save for tomorrow when spending today is cheaper?
 Why dream bigger, when little dreams are less expensive?  The
disillusioned answer of many Americans is simply: Why bother?
<p>
 But the current system does not simply sap the initiative and
aspirations of <I>individual</I> taxpayers, it undermines the
economic strength of our nation as a whole. As President Kennedy
once observed:  &quot;An economy hampered with high tax rates
will never produce enough revenue to balance the budget, just
as it will never produce enough output and enough jobs.&quot;
<p>
High marginal tax rates combined with multiple taxation of work, saving,
and investment act as a &quot;double-barreled shotgun aimed at
the American economy,&quot; accountant Ted Krauss told the commission
during a hearing in Washington.  The price tag was estimated by
Professor Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University who told the commission
that the income level in the United States could be 15 percent
to 20 percent higher than today if these biases did not exist.
<p>
This translates to losses of as much as $4,000 to $6,000 per year
for typical middle-income families.  The tremendous economic drain
caused by an anti-work, anti-saving, and anti-growth tax system
does not even take into account the enormous waste of resources
-- the time, money, and brainpower -- lost in trying to comply with
the current code.
<P>
<B>IMPOSSIBLY COMPLEX</B>
<p>
Today's tax code is so complex that many
Americans despair that only someone with an advanced degree in
rocket science could figure it out.  They are wrong. Even a certified
genius such as Albert Einstein needed help in figuring out his
Form 1040. Consider this example from the Internal Revenue Code's
rules on the Earned Income Tax Credit.  Here's how they describe
the little human creature we call a child:
<P>
(A) IN GENERAL.-The term &quot;qualifying child&quot; means, 
with respect to any taxpayer for any taxable year, 
an individual-
<P>
(i)  who bears a relationship to the taxpayer described in subparagraph
(B),
<P>
(ii)  except as provided in subparagraph (B)(iii), who has the
same principal place of abode as the taxpayer for more than one-half
of such taxable year,
<P>
(iii)  who meets the age requirements of subparagraph (C), and
<P>
(iv)  with respect to whom the taxpayer meets the identification
requirements of subparagraph (D).
<p>
This may look like English to
the experts, but it is total gibberish to most other Americans.
 If nothing is done to simplify the impossible language of the
current tax code, every American <I>will</I> need a laptop just
to figure it out.Professor James Eustice of NYU Law School once
defined an &quot;expert&quot; as &quot;a person who avoids small
errors as he sweeps on to the grand fallacy.&quot;   The problem
with the tax code, he says, &quot;is that it has been written
and interpreted by so many 'experts' that it has lost sight of
the fact that [real people] have to function under this system.&quot;
 The result is a tax code so complex that even the 'experts' themselves
can't figure it out.  This was illustrated by an annual survey
of tax experts conducted by <I>Money Magazine</I>. Each year,
the magazine would send a hypothetical tax return to 50 professional
tax preparers, and every year it got back a startling range of
responses, often encompassing 50 different answers.  Needless
to say, if the &quot;experts&quot; have trouble understanding
the tax system, the odds are stacked against the rest of us.
<p>
Convoluted rules and regulations force small businesses to hire expensive
accountants, forgo expansion or new opportunities, or in some
cases avoid the entire mess by going underground.  Tim Sabus of
Denver, Colorado, wrote to the commission: &quot;As an entrepreneur,
I experience first hand the horrors of our tax system.  It has
grown into a monstrous predator that kills incentives, swallows
time, and chokes the hopes and dreams of many.  We have abandoned
several job-creating business concepts due to the tax complexities
that would arise.&quot;  
<p>
Another exasperated business owner, Frank
Goodnight, told the commission at our Charlotte hearing that &quot;during
the recession of 1992, our company paid our accounting firm more
money than we paid in taxes.&quot;  He is not alone: in 1991,
the Tax Foundation reported that small corporations spent a <I>minimum</I>
of $382 in compliance costs for every $100 they paid in income
taxes.
<p>
According to 1995 I.R.S. estimates, businesses will spend
about 3.4 billion hours and individuals will spend about 1.7 billion
hours embroiled in tax-related paperwork. That means nearly three
million people -- more people than serve in the U.S. armed forces
-- work full time all year just to comply with tax laws, at a cost
of about $200 billion a year, according to the Tax Foundation.
In economic costs, this is like taking every new car, van, and
truck that General Motors builds in a year and driving them off
of a cliff. 
<P>
In a recent hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee,
William Dakin, senior tax counsel of Mobil, brought with him a
six foot high stack of bound papers, weighing 150 pounds.  These
were Mobil's corporate tax forms for 1993.  It cost Mobil an estimated
$10 million, and the equivalent of 57 people working full time
for a year, just to figure how much tax the company owed.  This
is the essence of a brutally complicated tax system.
<p>
Jeff Renner, a real-estate developer from Bellevue, Nebraska, voiced the concern
of many witnesses about the costly burden of compliance: &quot;That
time and effort and money did not educate a single child, it didn't
feed a single family, and it didn't produce a single tangible
object to improve the life of anyone.&quot; And Roger McCarthy
who runs an engineering firm in Menlo Park, California, complained
of how the tax industry absorbs the high-tech talent that could
be working in productive fields: &quot;It is disturbing that we
are not competing with companies like Intel and Hewlett-Packard
for these top stars, but rather with Big Six accounting firms.&quot;

<P>
<B>OVERLY INTRUSIVE </B>
<p>
There is no simple way of administering
a monstrously complex tax code, just as there is no fair way of
enforcing an unfair system.  Former Treasury official Ernest S.
Christian told the commission:  &quot;The present federal income
tax code is a national disgrace that...has characteristics that
would be condemned in any human personality.  It is inexcusably
class conscious, it is hypocritical, it is meddlesome, it is overbearing,
it is mean and hurtful, it is covetous, and above all, it is downright
foolish.&quot;  It is no wonder that the agency charged with enforcing
such a system has become the object of increasing public ire.
<p>
Perhaps the most troublesome consequence of our modern-day income tax
system is the enormous power that Congress has conferred on the
Internal Revenue Service to force taxpayers to comply with the
tax code. Twice as big as the C.I.A. and five times the size of
the F.B.I., the I.R.S. controls more information about individual
Americans than any other agency. Without a search warrant, the
I.R.S. has the right to search the property and financial documents
of American citizens.  Without a trial, the I.R.S. has the right
to seize property from Americans.  What the I.R.S. calls its own
&quot;presumption of correctness&quot; leaves many taxpayers feeling
that they are &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot; - a standard
which turns norms of justice upside down.
<p>
Even those within the I.R.S. hierarchy concede the inquisitorial nature of the powers
granted the agency.  Fred Goldberg, former Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, laments that &quot;while it is unfair to the many fine
people who work there, the I.R.S. has become a symbol of the most
intrusive, oppressive, and non-democratic institution in our democratic
society.&quot;
<p>
The code is so complicated that the I.R.S. itself has trouble understanding it.  &quot;As a retired revenue 
agent, I feel qualified to attest to the monstrosity that the Internal
Revenue Code has become,&quot; a citizen from Michigan wrote to
the commission.  &quot;When people who are employed to enforce
the tax laws have difficulty understanding its complicated and
sometimes incomprehensible provisions, it's time for a change.&quot;
 Of the liens the I.R.S. filed in 1990, a General Accounting Office
study found 16,000 errors.  The error rate for penalty notices
to employers on tax deposits has stood as high as 44 percent.
<p>
  Even when the I.R.S. is not in error, many of its practices
make little sense.  For example, tax documents are not treated
as &quot;timely filed&quot; if sent by Federal Express rather
than the U.S. Postal Service. The I.R.S. charges taxpayers interest
even when the taxpayer is due a refund.  In another example, one
particularly exasperated citizen wrote to the commission and enclosed
a notice just received from the I.R.S. assessing a penalty against
his company.  For an underpayment of one cent on his tax returns,
the company received a letter from the I.R.S. imposing a penalty
of more than $150. Others should be so lucky.  Many who testified
before the commission told tales not just of tax penalties, but
of thousands of dollars in legal fees and countless hours with
lawyers in efforts to rectify minor and unwitting infractions,
or clear their records of unjust charges.
<p>
In Charlotte, businessowner Jean Hodges recounted a tale of horror in which she was forced
to pay tens of thousands of dollars and spend untold hours trying
to correct an error made by her company's bookkeeper.  &quot;I
would like to see Congress pass legislation affording small businesses
relief from onerous and intimidating I.R.S. regulations,&quot;
she said.
<p>

The preceding pages illustrate what
is wrong with the current tax system.  But the case for a 21st
century tax system must be made by more than a mere indictment
of the status quo.  To paraphrase Peter Drucker: You have to decide
what's right before you decide what's possible.  The following
chapter outlines principles upon which a better future can be
built.

<title>Unleashing America's Potential -- Working Principles -- TRC</title>

<h3>WORKING PRINCIPLES</h3>
<blockquote>
<HR>

<P>

<B>...FOR THE WAY AMERICA WORKS</B></center>
<p>
When a group of architects its down to design a new building, they don't start by picking
out the draperies and choosing the color of the carpet.  They
begin by creating the basic outlines for the structure to come.
Similarly, the charge and purpose of this commission is not to
dictate the finishing touches of finalized legislation.  Instead,
it is to establish the foundation upon which a new system can
be raised.
<p>
The commission's six working principles for a 21st century
tax system are not isolated ideas, randomly grouped, but rather
principles that link together to form a sequence - a chain of
economic DNA - that can renew the health of our economy and release
the potential of the American people.
<p>
<B>ECONOMIC GROWTH</B>, the
engine of opportunity and prosperity, can only be unleashed by
a tax code that encourages initiative, hard work, and saving.
<p>
Such a system must be based on <B>FAIRNESS</B>, treating all citizens
equally. 
<p>
The system should achieve <B>SIMPLICITY</B> so that anyone
can figure it out. 
<p>
A fair tax system also requires <B>NEUTRALITY</B>,
 because the tax code should not pick winners or losers, or tax
saving more heavily than consumption. 
<p>
The new tax system also needs <B>VISIBILITY</B> so that everyone gets an honest accounting
of government's cost.
<p>
A visible tax system will have <B>STABILITY</B> so that people can plan for their futures.
<P>

<B>ECONOMIC GROWTH<I><br>
...Because expanding opportunity, prosperity,
and social mobility form the foundation of a free and healthy
society.</I></B>
<p>
None of the myriad challenges confronting our
nation -- be they poverty, crime, racial tension, welfare dependence,
or the budget deficit - can be solved without strong economic
growth.  Therefore, any new tax system must be predicated, first
and foremost, on a commitment to revitalizing the American economy
and lifting barriers to opportunity.  
<p>
No nation has ever taxed
its way to prosperity. Indeed, one of the world's fastest growing
economies over the past 20 years, Hong Kong, has one of the lowest
marginal tax rate systems -- 15 percent or less -- on labor and
capital.  Throughout the ages, higher taxes have been inversely
related to higher productivity and higher growth. Our own history provides evidence of this axiom. 
<p><center>
<img src="rpt1.gif" alt="graph">
</center>
<I>There is an inverse relationship
between revenue collections from the wealthy and high marginal
tax rates.</I>
<p>
America has experienced  three periods of very strong
economic growth in this century:  the 1920s, the 1960s, and the
1980s.  Each of these growth spurts coincided with a period of
reductions in marginal tax rates.  In the eight years following
the Harding-Coolidge tax cuts, the American economy grew by more
than five percent per year.  Following the Kennedy tax cuts in
the early 1960s, the economy grew by nearly five percent per year
and real tax revenues rose by 29% from 1962 to 1968 (after having
remained flat for a decade).  In the seven years following the
1981 Reagan tax cuts, the economy grew by nearly four percent
per year while real federal revenues rose by 26 percent. 
<p>
Over the years, we have seen economic output rise as tax rates <I>fell</I>
(and fall as tax rates rose).  But federal revenue raised as a
percentage of national output has remained <I>flat</I>.  As the
accompanying chart indicates, the federal government historically
collects about 19 percent of gross domestic product  - regardless
of how high the tax rate has been pushed.
<p><center>
<img src="rpt2.gif" alt="graph">
</center>
<I>The top line represents
the top personal tax rates from 1952 to 1995.  The bottom line
shows revenue to the federal government expressed as a percentage
of total economic output. </I>
<p>
High rates simply mean a smaller economy - and less income to tax.  Clearly, 19 percent of a small
economy brings in less revenue than 19 percent of a big economy.
 One more reason why economic growth should be the goal of any
new tax system.
<P>
<B>FAIRNESS <I>...Because democracy is based on the principle
of equality before the law.</I></B>  
<p>
 One of the main themes the commission heard in hearings around the country is that taxpayers
are willing to shoulder their share of the burden, as long as
others pull their own weight as well. The current tax code - with
its confusion of proliferating rates, deductions, exemptions,
and transfers of wealth from one constituency to another - contributes
to the overwhelming conviction of many Americans that the present
system is unfair. 
<p>
The definition of fairness that emerged from
hours of testimony before the commission was clear and unambiguous:
Any new system must satisfy three simple goals:   
<p>
<B>Tax equally: Does it treat taxpayers equally?
<P>
 True progressivity: Is it compassionate to those least able to pay? 
<p>
 Lower tax rates: Does it keep the tax rate low?</B>
<P>
<B>TAX EQUALLY</B>
<p>
To most Americans, fairness means that the rules
apply to everybody and everybody plays by the rules.  Christine
Perkowski of Richboro, Pennsylvania, wrote to the commission:
&quot;I do not mind paying my fair share as long as everyone else
does, but I feel that many, many people and companies are not
paying their fair share because they have the money to hire smart
accountants and lawyers.&quot;  
<p>
Under a simpler, fairer system,
no one will get out of paying their share - no matter how many
&quot;smart accountants and lawyers&quot; they can afford to hire.
 By streamlining the current Rube Goldberg contraption of multiple
rates and rules, we can reduce the number of moveable parts that
are manipulated by those who seek to take advantage of the system.
Clearly, under the current multiple-rate system, any tax &quot;loopholes&quot;
- deductions, exemptions, and credits - are more valuable to the
wealthy than to those in lower brackets, reinforcing the perception
that the rich do not pay their fair share.  A single-rate system
would level the playing field by eliminating the current distortion
in which tax breaks are worth more when a person's income is higher.
<p>
Melvin Barlow of Las Cruces, New Mexico, argued this definition of fairness
in a letter to the commission:  &quot;It is not right that the
harder a man works, the more he is taxed&quot; because the government
imposes a higher rate on each additional dollar he earns.  A single-rate
system keeps pace with the taxpayer as he climbs the hill of economic
opportunity and does not weigh him down more heavily with higher
rates at every step he tries to take. 
<P>
For taxable income above
the personal exemption, if one taxpayer earns ten times as much
as his neighbor, he should pay ten times as much in taxes.  Not
twenty times as much -- as he would with multiple and confiscatory
tax rates.  Not five times as much -- as he might with special
loopholes.  Ten times as much income, ten times as much taxes.
 That's the deal.   
<P>
<B>TRUE TAX PROGRESSIVITY </B>
<p>
Americans must first be able to
feed, clothe, and house their families before they are asked to
feed the federal spending machine.  A generous personal exemption
will allow those citizens at the bottom of the economic ladder
to gain a foothold and begin their climb before taxes take effect.
<p>
Today, those who try to move from welfare to work face the highest
marginal tax rates in America when lost benefits are included
--  facing effective tax rates that can actually exceed 100 percent.
 For example, if a single mother on welfare takes a job, she stands
to lose more than a dollar for every dollar she earns. Her first
paycheck may be more than canceled-out by the economic hits she
takes when she loses Aid to Families with Dependent Children,
Medicaid, Food Stamps, and public housing allowances.  In addition
to losing benefits, she now <I>also</I> must pay Social Security
and Medicare taxes, federal and probably state income tax, while
facing a host of work related costs, including transportation
and child care. 
<p>
We need a tax system that expands opportunity
and furthers economic independence by strengthening the link between
effort and reward, not by slapping poverty-inducing tax rates
on people as soon as they get their heads above water.  True progressivity
can be achieved by a single tax rate with a generous personal
exemption.  With an exemption, a &quot;single rate&quot; does
not mean that everyone pays the same percentage of income in taxes.
A generous personal exemption would remove the burden on those
least able to pay; as incomes rise, the average tax rate would
gradually rise up to the single rate.
<P>
<B>LOWER TAX RATES </B>
<p>
The consensus of the majority of witnesses
who wrote to the commission can be summed up in two words: lower
taxes.  
<p>
 Historians may point to America's beginnings and a revolution
deeply rooted in reaction to taxation of the original thirteen
British colonies.  Others reference religious traditions, including
Moses' warning to Pharaoh that he may tax up to one fifth and
no more -- before demanding that he &quot;let my people go.&quot;
 Indeed, Commissioner Dean Kleckner of Iowa touched a chord with
many when he observed, half-jokingly, that &quot;the Bible says
we ought to tithe and give 10% to the Lord.  I have a hard time
with the concept of giving more to government than we're asked
to give to God.&quot;
<p>
We suspect that most taxpayers have reached
their conviction that taxes are too high not by consulting their
history books or the Scriptures, but simply by comparing their
weekly paychecks to their family budgets and counting all the
sacrifices they must make simply to pay the government.  While
any new tax code must raise sufficient revenue to run the government,
it must also be mindful of the burdens these taxes place on America's
working families.  One way to reduce this burden would be to restrain
government spending.   By restoring the balance of power between
the federal government and the citizens who pay its bills, we
can restore basic faith in the system and keep the tax rate low.
<P>
<B>SIMPLICITY
<p>
 <I>...Because life is too short and peace of mind
too precious to waste your time and lose your temper trying to
figure out your taxes.</I></B> 
<p>
Filing tax returns will never be
anyone's favorite pastime, but neither should it be what it has
become: one of life's most nerve-wracking, gut-wrenching, and
mind-numbing chores.  With a simpler system, taxpayers will be
able to file their returns on a single piece of paper in less
time than it takes to finish your morning crossword puzzle.
<p>
As detailed earlier, the current tax code is exceedingly expensive
to comply with, increasingly difficult to enforce, and  nearly
impossible to understand. Ambiguities and inconsistencies in the
current tax code increase the likelihood that taxpayers will make
mistakes and fall victim to enforcement techniques considered
by many to be infringements of personal liberties. Long ago the
authors of the <I>Federalist Papers</I> warned, &quot;It will
be of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men
of their own choice if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot
be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood.&quot;
 A simplified, fairer tax system will let Americans get a handle
on their taxes, a grip on their government, and a hold of their
future.
<P>
<B>NEUTRALITY
<p>
 <I>...Because the tax code should not pick winners
or play favorites, but allow people freely to make decisions based
on their own needs and dreams.</I></B>
<p>
The tax code should be used
to raise revenue to run the government while doing the least possible
damage to the economy.  This means leaving individuals free to
make decisions and to set priorities based on economic reality
- not on the bureaucratic whims of Washington, D.C.
<p>
Taxes cannot help but raise the cost of everything they fall on.  But at least
they should fall on things neutrally without penalizing one form
of economic behavior and promoting another.  As Senator Robert
Bennett of Utah recently pointed out, &quot;Neutrality means that
the tax code should not be used to punish the bad guys and reward
the good guys.  We have other laws for that.&quot;  Unfortunately,
the current code strives to act as economic traffic cop -- giving
green lights to certain economic activities and red lights to
others. 
<p>
The result of the biases and distortions in the current
system is to make the market less free, the system less fair,
and families less financially secure.  As Frank Hayes, a public
accountant who testified before the commission in Omaha, remarked:
&quot;If there's a way to make things simpler and take the tax
aspect out of making day-to-day decisions, I think everybody would
become productive.&quot;
<p>
Perhaps the single most irrational and
economically damaging aspect of today's code is the layer upon
layer of taxes on saving and investment. By hitting income saved
and invested harder and more frequently than income consumed,
the current system prompts taxpayers to spend today what they
might otherwise save for tomorrow. This is particularly alarming
considering the problems facing public retirement programs and
the need to strengthen private retirement saving. The Bipartisan
Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform offered analyses and
proposals on this subject.
<P>
<B>VISIBILITY 
<P>
<I>...Because those who pay the price of government
have a right to see the bill.</I></B>
<p>
The history of hidden taxes, rapidly rising rates, and perpetual budget deficits proves that
what you don't know can hurt you.  The current system hides the
cost of government behind a chronic deficit and a maddening multiplicity
of taxes - many of which are virtually invisible to the taxpayer
who pays them.  How much did we pay in payroll taxes last year?
What excise taxes were hidden in the prices of the products we
bought?  What are the tax cost of exclusions, deductions, and
corporate income taxes?  Few of us know the answers. 
<P>
When it comes
to these hidden levies, ignorance is expensive bliss indeed.
<p>
One of the biggest political fictions in American history is the progressive
taxation of &quot;Mr. Nobody&quot; - the illusion that &quot;painless&quot;
taxes can be levied on businesses and on the goods and services
they sell. But goods and services do not pay taxes.  People do.
While businesses collect taxes, the burden of paying the &quot;business&quot;
taxes ultimately falls on each one of us as investors, workers,
or consumers.
<p>
Moreover, the invisibility of many taxes perpetuates
the fantasy that government is free -- even as its real costs shrink
our paychecks, sap our savings, drain our economy, and inflate
the budget deficit to ominous proportions.  Bob Genetski, an economist
and author who testified at hearings in Omaha, told the commission:
&quot;The cost of government is not obvious to people.  If you
hide the cost of government, people are going to demand more government
than they otherwise would.&quot; By severing the connection between
government's cost and its consumption, the current system deprives
citizens of the information they need in order to make rational
choices about what they want to buy from Washington and how much
they are willing to spend.
<p>
A visible system gives taxpayers an
<I>honest accounting</I> of government's expense and will make
it far more difficult for politicians to tinker with the tax code
without the democratic consent of those taxed.  
<p>
The incurable cynic H.L. Mencken once said, &quot;Conscience is the inner voice
which warns us somebody may be looking.&quot;  By  making taxes
visible, we can ensure that someone always will be.
<P>
<B>STABILITY
<p>
 <I>...Because taxpayers should be able to plan for
their future without the rules being changed in the middle of
the game.</I></B>
<p>
Everyone has heard the old saw that there are
only two things in life that are certain: death and taxes.  Given
the constant changes to the tax code over the past few decades,
the certainty of taxes has taken a perverse twist.  Like walking
blindfolded down a ship's gangplank, you know the end is out there
-- you just don't know when it'll arrive, how far you'll fall,
or how long you'll be able to keep your head above water.
<p>
This uncertainty has a debilitating effect on the economy, making it
very difficult for families and businesses, particularly  small
businesses, to plan for their future with confidence.  This exacts
a tremendous cost from those taxpayers and business owners who
must struggle to keep up with ever-shifting rules and regulations.
The retroactive tax increases passed in 1993 packed a double-whammy
- changing the rules when the game was half over. A stable tax
code must allow individuals to start a business, buy a house,
take out a loan, put money into savings, or plan for their children's
education without fear of what might lurk behind the next election
cycle.
<P>
<center><hr width=50%></center>
<P>
We know what works...Freedom works.  And only principles for tax
reform that maximize freedom can yield the opportunities, economic
growth, and untold possibilities for human advancement that are
its fruits.  In his last public address, Abraham Lincoln declared
that, &quot;Important principles may and must be inflexible.&quot;
 By laying down these important principles, this commission hopes
to help build a future of growing prosperity for many generations
to come.

<h3>A NEW TAX SYSTEM FOR THE 21ST CENTURY</h3>
<blockquote>
<HR>

<P>
<B>RECOMMENDATIONS</B>
</center><p>

Among the hundreds of testimonies and citizen
letters reviewed by this commission, one of the most compelling
was that of Van Woods, owner of Sylvia's Restaurant.  Mr. Woods
and his family run a successful soul food establishment in the
heart of Harlem, a community with painfully high unemployment.
In concluding his testimony to the commission, he said, &quot;Opportunity
is the ability to look in the face of my son and say: 'I don't
know if you <I>will</I> succeed, but you <I>can</I>.'&quot; 
<p>
The objective of this commission, the aim of its members, is to help
make that promise a reality -- not just for Mr. Woods' children,
but for every child in every neighborhood in America's 21st century.
<p>
In submitting these recommendations, the commission does not seek
to toss yet another piece of legislation on the table.  Nor was
its goal to pick and choose among existing plans, or worse, create
a hodgepodge compromise from elements of existing alternatives.
 What we are offering to the American people and their elected
officials is a set of standards - a quality control - that any
new plan must meet if it is to meet the bold objective of replacing
the current tax code with a fair and simple system.  The preceding
chapter provides one half of the check-list: the principles that
any new system should embody.  This chapter provides the other
half: key recommendations that any new system should follow.
<p>
The core recommendations of the National Commission on Economic Growth
and Tax Reform are:
<P><ul>
<B><li> Adopt a single, low tax rate with a generous personal exemption</B>
<P>
<B><li>Lower the tax burden on America's working families and remove
it on those least able to pay</B>
<P>
<B><li>End biases against work, saving, and investment</B>
<P>
<B><li>Allow full deductibility of the payroll tax for working men
and women</B>
<P>
<B><li>Require a two-thirds super-majority vote in Congress to increase
tax rates</B>
</ul><p>
 We believe that, with a pro-growth, pro-family tax
system, we can achieve these goals within the context of budget
equilibrium. The commission believes that this new tax system
can satisfy our six working principles:
<P><ul>
<li> <B>Economic growth</B> through incentives to work, save, and
invest;
<P>
<li> <B>Fairness</B> for all taxpayers;
<P>
<li> <B>Simplicity</B> so that anyone can figure it out;
<P>
<li> <B>Neutrality</B> so that people and not government can make
choices;
<P>
<li><B>Visibility</B> so that people know the cost of government;
and
<P>
<li> <B>Stability</B> so that people can plan for their future. 
</ul><p>
The following pages explain the core recommendations in light of these
principles, and explore some of the trade-offs involved in reaching
a system that meets these goals.  This chapter also touches on
a few of the corollary points that flow from these main recommendations.
  Staff discussion papers are provided for those who seek more
detail on the concepts involved.
<P>
<B>RECOMMENDATIONS 
<p>
<I>Single Tax Rate.</I></B> A single rate is
a fair rate. One tax rate, coupled with a generous personal exemption,
together produce a progressive average tax rate. Low income taxpayers
would owe little or no tax.  But everyone who earns enough to
cross the threshold of the exemption would face exactly the same
tax rate on any additional income.
<p>
A single-rate system is not only fair, it also can satisfy the principles of simplicity, visibility,
and stability.  A single rate is clearly simple, and it is highly
visible: one rate -- as opposed to the current, confusing mess-
will stand out and be remembered by all.  A simple, visible system
also can be stable: by keeping our eyes on the single rate, we
can keep politicians' hands off it.  
<p>
Nobel Prize-winning economist F.A. Hayek described economic redistribution through multiple
tax rates as &quot;the chief source of irresponsibility&quot;
in politics and &quot;the crucial issue on which the whole character
of future society will depend.&quot;  A system of graduated marginal
rates violates the principle of fairness -- that if a law applies
to citizen A, it must equally apply to citizen B.
<P>
Take, for example, two wheat producers, each farming the same-sized plot of land.
 One of them produces 1,000 bushels of wheat; the other, through
harder work and more careful land management, produces 1,200 bushels.
 To tax the income represented by the additional 200 bushels of
wheat more heavily than the income represented by the first 1,000
would be demonstrably unfair to the more productive farmer.  And
yet, that is the nature of a multi-rate tax system: it takes more
from  people for their hard work, creativity, and success.
<P>
The added output -- and the resulting added income -- of one taxpayer
does  not diminish his neighbor, and is not earned  at his neighbor's
expense.  Indeed, it expands economic opportunity, increases the
availability of goods and services, and helps others be more productive
as well.
<P>
<I>True</I> progressivity requires a low tax rate coupled
with a generous personal exemption.  This would grant low-income
Americans an &quot;economic head-start&quot; -- allowing them to
begin their climb toward economic independence before they are
asked to shoulder their share of government's cost.  The larger
goal is to move beyond merely maintaining low income Americans
at subsistence level livelihoods toward giving them an opportunity
to permanently escape poverty.
<P>
Here, as elsewhere, there are trade-offs
involved.  The goal of protecting those least able to bear the
burden of taxation conflicts with the principle of visibility:
those exempt from taxes don't see the price of the government
services we all pay for.  The commission believes that the costs
-- both economic and moral -- of burdening low-income people with
taxes that can bar them from reaching their fullest potential
outweigh competing concerns.  By offering low-income Americans
a window of economic opportunity, the personal exemption can help
liberate those whom the public sector has failed to help and the
private sector has failed to reach.
<p>
<I><B>Lower Tax Rates.</B></I>
 The commission recommends that the single rate be as low as possible.
 We encourage the adoption of such a low rate within the framework
of budget  equilibrium.  Furthermore, we strongly urge that the
rate be lowered over time as a growing economy yields rising revenues.<I>
 We recommend that added revenues be considered, not as more Monopoly
money for Washington, but as a &quot;growth dividend&quot; to
be paid out to the American people.
<p>
 <B>Eliminate biases against work, saving, and investment.</B></I> The principles of fairness
and neutrality require that all income be taxed the same, whether
it is used for consumption or saving, whether it is produced in
small businesses or large corporations, and whether it is earned
by employees or the self employed.
<p>
Under the current system, income that is used for consumption is taxed once, while income that
is saved is taxed again and again.  For businesses, complex depreciation
rules mean that income from investment in buildings and equipment
is overstated. This forces people to pay taxes before they have
recovered the cost of their investment.

<blockquote><HR>
<center><b>BIAS AGAINST SAVING AND INVESTMENT</b>  
</center>

Multiple taxation creates a huge bias against saving and investment
that must be eliminated in a new system.  Consider, for example,
the effect of the current system on a family in the 28 percent
tax bracket that earns an extra $1,000. <p>

Of that $1,000, they will pay $280 in federal income tax and keep $720. If they spend that $720, say, 
taking the family to Disneyland, they incur no further federal tax, no matter how many times they ride the 
Space Mountain.
<P>
But suppose, instead, they decide to invest the income in stocks to create financial security for their future. 
Bad move, says the current tax code.
<p>
<b>First</b>, they already had to pay income taxes to have the $720 to invest. <b>Second</b>, the 
company in which they invest wll generally pay tax at a 35 percent rate on the returns on the amount 
invested. <b>Third</b>, if the company pays dividends, the family will pay a 28 percent tax on the 
dividends they receive. Alternatively, if the company retains the after tax income for reinvestment or finds 
other ways to boost future eaernings, the stock price will rise. The future earnings will be taxed, and if the 
family sells the stock, it will pay a capital gains tax on a 28 percent rate (see below). <b>Fourth</b>, if 
they hold the proceeds of the sale until death, they will be subject to an estate tax that can go as high as 55 
percent.
<p>
Both the investment in the stock market and the investment in the family trip produce returns -- one yields 
warm memories of the past, the other provides real hope for the future. The returns on the investment in the 
trip are not subject to tax;  the returns on the investment in the stock market are. (Staff discussion papers 
contain further information on the tax code's bias against savings and investment.)
<hr></blockquote>
<p>
The box above provides an example of the problems created by the current tax code.
<p>
The biases result in less work, savings, and investment, lower productivity and wages, fewer jobs, less 
income to spend on housing and education, and fewer assets to furnish income in retirement than would 
otherwise be the case. As the example at left demonstrates, these biases affect every family that is trying to 
save for the future.
<p>
In order to end these biases, the tax system must either <i>let savers deduct their savings or exclude the 
returns on the savings from their taxable income</i>. It must <i>end double-taxation of businesses and 
their owners</i> and <i>permit expensing of investment outlays</i>. it must also address the following 
issues:
<p>
<b><i>Capital Gains Taxes</i></b>.  If a new tax system is to eliminate biases against savings and 
investment, it must also <b>abolish separate taxation of capital gains</b>. As commissioner Ted 
Forstmann said, "The biggest  depressant on the rate of capital formation is the risk of confiscation by the 
government." The United States now imposes some of the highest tax rates on capital of any developed 
nation -- a 28 percent tax on long-term capital gains unindexed for inflation.  Compare that with a 16 
percent rate
in France; a 1 percent rate in Japan; and a zero tax on capital
gains in Hong Kong, Germany, South Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia.
<p>
The result is to punish risk-taking, shrink the pool of capital
needed for investment, and deprive would-be entrepreneurs of a
chance to climb the ladder of economic opportunity.  &quot;The
tax on capital gains,&quot; argued President Kennedy in 1963,
&quot;directly affects investment decisions, the mobility and
the flow of risk capital...the ease or difficulty experienced
by new ventures in obtaining capital, and thereby the strength
and potential for growth in the economy.&quot;
<p>
By shrinking the
supply of available seed corn, the capital gains tax acts as a
future tax on wealth to be realized, businesses to be built, and
jobs to be created.  Those hardest hit are not the wealthy -- who
by definition have their capital gains, their wealth, behind them
-- but rather all those who have yet to realize their capital gains:
the poor, the young, and minorities.
<P>
<i>&quot;Death&quot; Taxes</i>.  It makes little sense and is patently unfair to impose extra taxes
on people who choose to pass their assets on to their children
and grandchildren instead of spending them lavishly on themselves.
Families faced with these confiscatory taxes often find themselves
forced to sell off farms or businesses, destroying jobs in the
process.  &quot;We must help to save the family farm, ranch, and
business,&quot; said Commissioner Jack Faris.  
<p>
Unfortunately, family businesses often get hit hardest because they can't afford
to hire expensive lawyers and accountants.  As Douglas Darch of
Wake Forest, North Carolina testified to the commission: &quot;There
is something wrong with a tax system that results in the systematic
dismantling of small businesses to meet estate tax obligations.&quot;
<P>
The tragedy is that while these taxes cause much suffering for taxpaying
families, they generate a relatively small amount of revenue.
 Estate and gift taxes appear to count for less than 1% of federal
revenues -- but even that low figure is exaggerated and misleading.
 Professor Douglas Bernheim of Stanford University testified before
the commission that the estate tax may not really raise any revenue
at all, because more income tax is lost from &quot;estate planning&quot;
than is ultimately collected at death.
<p>
<b><i>Full Deductibility of Payroll Taxes for All Working Americans</i></b>

.The Commission recommends that
federal payroll taxes be fully deductible - both for employers
and employees.  Many employers and employees pay more in payroll
taxes than they do in federal income taxes.  Making these taxes
deductible  for both employers and employees will reduce obstacles
to hiring more workers and will fuel America's job growth into
the 21st century.
<p>
Under the current tax system, workers pay income
tax on their Social Security tax  -- a tax on a tax.  Employers
can deduct their half of the payroll tax, but employees cannot.
 The combined burden of both income and Social Security tax is
particularly hard on workers with incomes too high to be eligible
for the Earned Income Tax Credit (roughly $25,000), but too low
to be below the threshold where the Social Security tax stops
being taken out of paychecks (about $63,000).
<p>
When employer and
employee payroll taxes of 15.3% are taken into account, workers
in the 28% tax bracket actually face a brutal marginal tax rate
of more than 43% on any additional income they earn.  A single
low tax rate would help relieve this demoralizing tax penalty
on work and saving.  But it still leaves a tax on a tax.
<p>
Making the Social Security tax deductible would help reduce the combined
marginal tax rates on middle-income taxpayers who get hit by both
taxes.   A one-earner couple with a $40,000  income currently
pays tax as though the couple really received  the entire $40,000
- even though they have already paid over $3,000 as their share
of the payroll tax, leaving less than $37,000 on which they could
possibly pay income taxes.   By making the payroll tax deductible,
income taxes would be calculated on the basis of  working families'
real net incomes.  
<p>
This need for change was highlighted in a citizen
letter to the commission from Spencer Riedel of Flagstaff, Arizona,
who described the Social Security payroll tax as &quot;a huge
heartache...Is there no way to stop this 'hidden' tax?...If we
could eliminate this unfair mandated tax, our business would hire
two more people.&quot;
<p>
<b><i>A Two-Thirds Majority Vote in Congress To Raise The Tax Rate.</i></b>  The commission 
recommends that the new system
be guaranteed both stability and longevity by requiring a super-majority
vote of both houses of Congress to raise the rate.
<p>
In hearings across the country, one depressing but all-too-familiar response
from taxpayers could be bluntly paraphrased as: &quot;Change,
schmange.  That's what you guys said the last time you talked
about tax reform.&quot;  The roller-coaster ride of tax policy
in the past few decades has fed citizens' cynicism about the possibility
of real, long-term reform, while fueling frustration with Washington.
 The initial optimism inspired by the low rates of the 1986 Tax
Reform Act soured into disillusionment and anger when taxes subsequently
were hiked two times in less than seven years. The commission
believes that a two-thirds super-majority vote of Congress will
earn Americans' confidence in the longevity, predictability, and
stability of any new tax system.
<p>
<b>The goal:  A single low rate on
income with a generous personal exemption, a lower burden on working
families,  an end to biases in the tax code -- all set in the stone
of a congressional super-majority.  The recommendations in this
chapter form the core framework for a new 21st century tax system.
</b>
<P>
<B>OTHER ISSUES
<p>
 <I>Deductions and Exclusions</I></B> Concerns about
special provisions in the existing tax code have the potential
to derail debate over the merits of a new tax system and the tremendous
benefits it could bring to the American economy.  There are important
social and economic consequences of certain deductions and exclusions.
 The commission believes they should be considered with an eye
to their impact on the tax rate, the costs to the Treasury, and
the consequences of change -- and within the context of the values
of the American people.  For example, the home mortgage interest
deduction has spurred home ownership in America; an important
goal of our commission is to spread ownership to give more people
a stake in the system. And, at a time when America needs a renaissance
of private giving and commitment to overcome those social problems
which government programs have either failed to improve or made
worse -- we need a system which encourages people to take more
responsibility for communities and neighbors in need.  We welcome
debate over the best way to protect these institutions and preserve
the values they represent within the context of the dynamic new
tax system we envision.
<p>
<I><B>Simplify International Taxation:</B></I> Congress should consider a territorial tax system.  The 
current system of taxing international business operations is one of the
most complicated parts of the Internal Revenue Code.  It leads
to enormous costs of compliance and enforcement, raises little
revenue, and damages the competitiveness of U.S. businesses operating
abroad.  Further, it encourages them to keep reinvesting profits
abroad rather than bringing the money back home where it could
be reinvested in America.
<p>
Whatever new tax system is chosen, there
must be a clearer, simpler, and more certain determination, relative
to current practice, of what income is foreign or domestic or
what international transaction is taxable.  In addition, attention
must be given to the proper tax treatment of foreign source license
fees, royalties, and other intangibles so as not to discourage
research and development in the United States.
<p>
<I><B>Strengthen Private Retirement Saving:</B></I>  The commission is particularly
concerned that Americans are not saving enough for their own retirement.
A tax system that eliminates the bias against saving is essential
to encourage people to accumulate more assets throughout their
lives.  There is, however, no guarantee that all individuals or
families will save enough to be secure and financially independent
in their retirement, even under a new tax system. 
<p>
With the problems
facing public retirement programs, it is essential that private
retirement saving be strengthened.  Without sufficient retirement
saving, many people will become dependent upon the government
in their old age, necessitating either sharp increases in taxes
on future generations or a significantly diminished standard of
living. Providing strong encouragement for individuals and families
to take responsibility for their own retirement will go a long
way toward preventing uncontrolled growth of government while
ensuring a more comfortable, more secure, and more independent
retirement.
<p>
Therefore, any tax system should encourage people to
save for their own retirement.   Further, the commission recommends
that Congress begin the process of policy changes that will result
in people taking more responsibility for their own retirement
saving. Other changes within the overall income and payroll tax
systems also should be considered.
<P>
<B>MEASURING RESULTS</B>
<p>
One of the chief objectives of adopting
a new tax system is to promote economic growth.  If we are successful,
the added growth will provide the tax revenues to pay for a portion
of the change in the tax law.  Failure to count these added revenues
will make it appear more difficult to make the necessary tax changes.
<p>
One couldn't catch the blossoming of a rose in a split-second single-frame
exposure, or capture a speeding bullet with time-lapse photography.
 Similarly, the tools with which we anticipate and examine changes
in government policies, including tax policy, must mirror the
way the economy actually changes as a result of these actions.
<p>

When a bill is being debated before Congress, members are required
to produce estimates of the costs of the legislation.  For years,
Congress has used what are called &quot;static revenue estimates&quot;
to produce these figures. Static revenue estimates attempt to
predict future government revenues by applying the new law to
today's economy as though it would not be affected by the new
law.  History has shown that these estimates are limited in their
ability to predict revenues. 
<p>
We recommend that Congress instead
use estimates that measure the impact  policy changes will have
on people's behavior and on future economic activity, and that
therefore more accurately predict implications for future revenue
collections. Use of this &quot;dynamic&quot; scoring, of course,
must be based upon realistic assumptions regarding tax rates,
tax revenues, and economic activity. It is essential to avoid
overly optimistic as well as overly pessimistic projections. (Further
details are provided in the staff discussion papers.)
<P>
<B>TRANSITION ISSUES</B>
<p>
The defenders of the status quo will say
that our recommendations for a new tax system will mean a tax
increase on the middle class or cause a flood of red ink. 
<p>
 We strongly disagree. The thinking behind our current tax system
is a model that does not fit tomorrow's world. Complainers fail
to understand the new world that this new system will create.
The tax reform we envision will create a different climate for
economic growth.  It will lift incomes.  It will reduce interest
rates.  It will put people to work.  It will reduce the use of
tax shelters.  It will reduce the need for social safety-net spending.
 It will foster millions of new businesses and jobs. In the process,
the transition will help to pay for itself.
<p>
That doesn't mean there will not be difficult issues to address during the transition.
 In particular, policy makers must take care to protect existing
savings, investments, and other assets.  Whatever the challenges
this change presents, we believe that none of the issues is insurmountable.
<p>
Whatever equivocations there may be toward the future, we must not let
them rob us of the unparalleled economic growth, the unimagined
opportunities for human fulfillment and advancement that now lay
trapped within the cage of the current system, waiting for us
to open the door.
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B>
<p>
The recommendations outlined here can lay the
groundwork for a pro-growth, pro-family tax code for America's
21st century.  As construction of the new system moves forward,
there will be many decisions to be met and made along the way.
 While we have tried to raise a number of those issues here, 
and clarify others in the discussion papers, it is impossible
to anticipate every question that will arise as we move toward
a new system.
<p>
We urge that the American people participate in this
debate at every step of the way.  This is all the more crucial
given the critical nature of the transition issues involved as
replacement of the current system gets underway.  Half a century
ago, the economist Joseph Schumpeter described capitalism as inseparable
from &quot;the perennial gale of creative destruction.&quot; 
In the transition to a fairer system and a freer market, the winds
of change are bound to increase.  Those who have a stake in the
status quo will not welcome change; others may prefer the cramped
confines of the familiar present to the uncertainty of a yet realized
future.
<p>
If the taxpayer testimonies we listened to and letters
we received bear any evidence of the broader mood of the country,
we believe that Americans are overwhelmingly eager to make that
change, ready for its challenges, and look forward to its <BR>
opportunities.
<p>
It has been a privilege for us to serve on this
commission, and each of us has taken the responsibility very seriously.
 We have been educated and inspired by the many, many Americans
we have talked with.  While the tax system is in serious disrepair,
the American spirit and will for change are stronger than ever.
 We thank Senate Majority Leader Dole and Speaker Gingrich for
giving us this opportunity by delegating us to do this important
work. 
<p>
 We quote in this report many of the citizen witnesses who
wrote to us and who testified at our hearing.  We thank them and
the many expert witnesses who prepared testimony and answered
our many questions about the intricacies of tax reform. We are
very much indebted to the lawmakers who have spent years of their
careers studying tax reform, inspiring serious debate on the flaws
of the current system, and developing proposals for major tax
reform.  Among them:  House Majority Leader Dick Armey, Ways and
Means Chairman Bill Archer, Senate Budget Chairman Pete Domenici,
Senator Sam Nunn, Joint Economic Committee Chairman Connie Mack,
Senator Bob Bennett, and Congressman Dick Gephardt.  Others whose
work has been invaluable to the process include Senator Richard
Shelby, Senator Richard Lugar, Senator Arlen Specter, ranking
Ways and Means Committee member Sam Gibbons, and many others.
<P>
<center><hr width=50%></center>
<p>
It has been said that every breakthrough in human understanding
has come in the form of a simplification.  The complex, bureaucratic
tax code of the 20th century will not enable us to keep pace with
the complex and rapidly changing world of the 21st century.  A
simplified tax code would have an instant impact on peoples' lives
-freeing up time, energy and resources currently wasted in costly
compliance for productive endeavors.
<p>
The impact on the economy
would be immediate and profound, putting the goal of a doubled
economic growth rate within our reach.  The moment the dead weight
and distortions of the current tax system are lifted from our
economy, the explosion of new investment, new businesses, and
new jobs would transform the economic and social landscape of
our country.  A newly galvanized economy would create work for
all those who wanted it, unleash unimagined innovations,  act
as a magnet for capital from all over the world, and boost wages
and living standards for America's working families.
<p>
We also believe that a new tax code can help replenish the wellsprings of public
trust - in our government, in each other, and in ourselves.  By
treating citizens equally and with respect, a new tax code can
restore faith in the basic fairness of the system.  A simplified
system will eliminate the fear that special advantages hide in
complexity, while restoring citizens' confidence in their own
ability to comply with the code.
<p>
This vision of the future is rooted in both a realism about human nature and an idealism about human
potential.  We recognize that a new tax code, no matter how radical,
cannot solve all problems.  It cannot make fathers love mothers
or guarantee children happy homes.  Government reform, however
vast or vaunted, cannot change hearts. 
<p>
 But it can lift hopes. At its best, it does this by seeking, as Lincoln did, &quot;to
elevate the condition of men -- to lift artificial weights from
all shoulders -- to clear the paths of laudable pursuit for all.&quot;
<P>
By freeing citizens from the costly encumbrances of the current
tax code, by restoring the link between effort and reward, by
allowing individuals to save and invest in their future, and by
unleashing the pent up power of our economy, this new system can
 lead to Lincoln's &quot;new birth of freedom,&quot; and launch
us into the next American century.

salary.  Ms. Adams later immigrated to the United States and went
on to become founder of the San Diego-based Market Development,
Inc., a consumer, marketing, and opinion research firm with nearly
100 employees.  Since 1978, her company has serviced Latin-American
consumers in the United States and Latin America and has become
one of the top 100 research firms in the country.   
<P>
<I>&quot;The conditions that produced the current tax system no
longer contribute positively to a 21st century global economy.
 We now have the opportunity to create a tax system that is more
responsive to our times, situation, and needs and, hopefully,
we will grasp it fully.&quot;
<p>
<B>J. Kenneth Blackwell</B></I> lived
in public housing for the first seven years of his life only to
later pioneer housing reforms as the Deputy Undersecretary of
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.  Today,
he serves as Treasurer of the State of Ohio, having previously
held public office on the Cincinnati City Council before becoming
mayor of Cincinnati.  He is a member of the Council on Foreign
Relations in New York, and previously served as U.S. Ambassador
to the United Nations Human Rights Commission and as vice president
of Xavier University in Cincinnati.   
<P>
<I>&quot;There is something fundamentally wrong with a tax system
that costs Americans $250 billion to comply.  A simpler tax system
would help break the chains that currently bind entrepreneurial
spirit.&quot;</I> 
<p>
<I><B>Herman Cain</B></I> learned the value
of hard work from his father who concurrently worked three jobs
- one of which was as a janitor at The Pillsbury Company in Atlanta.
 At age 12, Herman went to work with his father at Pillsbury,
helping him as &quot;assistant janitor.&quot;  Twenty-two years
later Cain would become a Pillsbury vice president (computer systems)
and later be selected as president of the firm's then-subsidiary
company, Godfather's Pizza, Inc. In 1988, he successfully led
a group of Godfather's Pizza, Inc. senior management in purchasing
the chain from Pillsbury.  He currently serves as chairman and
CEO of Godfather's Pizza, Inc. Prior to his tenure at Godfather's,
Cain worked for the U.S. Navy as a mathematician, the Coca-Cola
Company as a business analyst, and was an executive with Burger
King Corporation.   
<P>
<I>&quot;One of America's greatest strengths is its ability to
change...our 82 year old tax 'mess' is long overdue for dramatic,
sensible change.&quot; </I> 
<p>
<I><B>Carroll Campbell</B></I> served
two, four-year terms as one of the most popular and innovative
governors in South Carolina's history.  His legacy as governor
includes government reform, record job expansion, net tax cuts,
economic growth, and investment in his state.  Campbell launched
his political career in 1970, first serving in the state House
and Senate and later in the U.S. Congress, where he served on
the Banking, Appropriations, and Ways and Means committees.  He
also served as chairman of the National Governors' Association,
the Republican Governors' Association, and the Southern Governors'
Association, as well as Chairman of the Southern Growth Policies
Board.  Today he is president and CEO of the American Council
of Life Insurance.  
<P>
<I>&quot;The tax system should encourage investment and job creation,
foster long-term savings, and increase the focus on individual
and family economic responsibility.  In short, tax policy should
encourage long-term savings for retirement.&quot;
<p>
<B>Pete du Pont</B></I>,
during his tenure as governor of Delaware from 1977-1985, implemented
a highly successful pro-growth tax policy by dramatically lowering
marginal tax rates, causing the state's economy to boom and overall
tax collections to jump, and enacting a constitutional amendment
that limited both tax and state spending increases.  He also served
as a state legislator and Congressman and ran as a Republican
candidate for President of the United States.  He currently serves
as policy chairman of the National Center for Policy Analysis,
and writes a weekly column on public policy that is distributed
to more than four hundred newspapers across the nation.   
<P>
<I>&quot;The men and women who spoke to us reflected an American
consensus:  Our tax system is destroying our opportunities.  It's
time to replace it.&quot;
<p>
<B>Jack Faris</B></I> started working
at age 13 earning 50 cents an hour at his parent's service station.
Faris learned early in life the challenges of running a small
family business and the importance of hard work. After running
his own business in Nashville, Tennessee, he became president
and CEO of the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB),
the nation's largest small business advocacy organization with
more than 600,000 members.  
<P>
<I>&quot;Regulation and taxes are strangling small business on
main street.  Give us relief and we will create the jobs and build
America's future for our children and grandchildren.&quot;  </I>
<P>
<i><B>Matt Fong</B></I> serves as Treasurer of the State of California.
 Prior to his election, Fong served as Vice Chairman of the State
Board of Equalization, California's tax agency.   Fong streamlined
the agency, cutting millions of dollars of waste, reformed the
state's tax code sponsoring changes to the unitary tax, and made
the agency more &quot;taxpayer friendly.&quot;  A graduate of
the U.S. Air Force Academy currently holding the rank of Lt. Col.
USAFR, he earned an MBA and law degree, started a small business,
and worked for Sheppard, Mullin, Richtor and Hampton as a transactional
corporate attorney. 
<P>
<I>&quot;Too many Americans are sitting on the economic sidelines.
 A progressive single rate flat tax will radically jump start
job creation, moving the unemployed off the sidelines to jobs.&quot;
<p>
<B>Theodore J. Forstmann</B></I> is one of the most admired entrepreneurs
in America with an unrivaled record of successful investments.
 Forstmann splits his time between running his firm, speaking
out on behalf of economic opportunity and growth, and helping
children worldwide.  He has poured his energies and resources
into leading relief efforts in Bosnia, sponsoring charities in
South Africa, and funding scholarships and teaching students in
America's inner cities. He is the senior partner of Forstmann
Little &amp; Co.
<P>
<I> &quot;The current tax system is ridiculously complicated,
economically destructive, and morally corrosive.  We desperately
need a new tax code that puts the individual - not government
- at the center of the equation.&quot;
<p>
<B>Dean Kleckner</B></I>
took over the rented family farm in Iowa at the age of 18 when
his father died. Kleckner served in the Army and later returned
to Iowa where he started on his own with a dozen sows, a dozen
cows and 300 chickens.  Today he owns a 350-acre corn, soybean,
and hog farm, and serves as President of the American Farm Bureau
Federation, a post he has held since 1986.  He also serves on
the U.S. Advisory Committee on Trade Policy, a post to which he
was first appointed by President Reagan, and reappointed by Presidents
Bush and Clinton.  
<P>
<I>&quot;Our tax system must be simple and equitable for all taxpayers,
with no loopholes.  It has to let hard-working taxpayers keep
more of the money they have earned.&quot;
<p>
<B>Shirley Peterson</B></I> is president of Hood College in Frederick, Maryland.  Prior to
assuming the college presidency, she practiced tax law and also
served as Commissioner of Internal Revenue under President Bush
and Assistant Attorney General (Tax Division) at the U.S. Justice
Department under President Bush.  She was raised on farm in Colorado.

<P>
<I>&quot;Citizens from around the country told us that the current
law is too complex.  This complexity breeds disrespect for the
law and for our government.  It time to repeal the Internal Revenue
Code and start over.&quot;
<p>
<B>John Snow</B></I> worked his way
through college as a sports coach.  Today he serves as chairman,
president, and CEO of CSX Corporation in Richmond, Virginia, and
has been with the company since 1977. Snow, who has a Ph.D. in
economics from the University of Virginia and a law degree from
George Washington University, also served as Deputy Undersecretary
of the U.S. Department of Transportation, as a private attorney
and a college professor.
<P>
<I>&quot;The current tax system dims our prospects for the future
and must be replaced by a new system for the 21st century which
helps Americans to capitalize on opportunities - not stifle economic
growth and entrepreneurial activity.&quot;  
<p>
<B>John Wieland</B></I> always worked part-time growing up, from working at a gas station
to delivering newspapers to stocking vending machines. Today,
he is a president of John Wieland Homes, Inc., of Atlanta, employing
more than 700 full-time employees and thousands of subcontractors.
 For Wieland, success has meant the ability to give back to his
community by providing housing for the working poor and working
with Habitat for Humanity, formerly serving as a member of the
International Board of Habitat.  
<P>
<I>&quot;The consensus of the American people demands a completely
new, simple, and fair tax code.  Increased prosperity for ALL
will be the outcome.  The time is now.&quot;</I>

<h2>HISTORICAL LESSONS FOR TAX REFORM</h2>
by Daniel Mitchell</center><P>
<blockquote>
 Tax reform is not a voyage into uncharted waters.  Since the
inception of the income tax, America has experienced dramatic
changes in tax policy on many occasions.  These changes offer
valuable lessons about the impact of tax policy and strongly suggest
that a single rate system will yield great benefits.  The United
States has had three major episodes of individual income tax rate
reductions -- the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s.  In all three periods,
individual income tax revenues increased in general, and the amount
of taxes paid by the rich rose in particular.  All three periods,
not coincidentally, saw strong economic growth.
<P>
 Periods of rising tax rates, by contrast, are associated with
weaker economic performance and slower revenue growth.  Tax rate
increases in the 1930s, starting with Herbert Hoover's decision
to boost the top rate from 25 percent to 63 percent, contributed
to the economy's misery during the depression years.  Inflation-induced
bracket creep in the 1970s and early 1980s certainly hindered
economic growth in the 1973-1982 period (prior to the 1981 tax
rate reductions and indexing).  Finally, tax increases in the
1990s have resulted in sub-par growth and stagnant incomes.
<P>
 Finally, it is worth noting that John F. Kennedy was right; a
growing economy is the best way to raise earnings and living standards.
 Earnings for all income groups rose during the 1980s once tax
rate reductions went into effect. 
<P>
<B>Looking at the evidence: The 1920s</B>
<P>
 The Revenue Acts of 1921, 1924, and 1926 slashed individual income
tax rates and reduced the top rate from 73 percent to 25 percent.
 Notwithstanding (or perhaps because of) the dramatic reduction
in tax rates, individual income tax revenues increased substantially
during the 1920s, rising from $719 million in 1921 to $1160 million
in 1928, an increase of more than 61 percent (in a period of virtually
no inflation).  The share of the tax burden paid by the rich (those
with incomes of $50,000 and up in those days) rose dramatically,
climbing from 44.2 percent in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928.
<P>
 Andrew Mellon, the Treasury Secretary who oversaw the tax cuts,
wrote, &quot;The history of taxation shows that taxes which are
inherently excessive are not paid.  The high rates inevitably
put pressure upon the taxpayer to withdraw his capital from productive
business and invest it in tax-exempt securities or to find other
lawful methods of avoiding the realization of taxable income.
 The result is that the sources of taxation are drying up; wealth
is failing to carry its share of the tax burden; and capital is
being diverted into channels which yield neither revenue to the
Government nor profit to the people.&quot;
<P>
<B>Looking at the evidence: The 1960s</B>
<P>
 
<P>
 President Kennedy proposed a series of individual income tax
rate reductions in 1963 that resulted in legislation that dropped
the top tax rate from 91 percent in 1963 to 70 percent by 1965.
 Income tax revenues grew strongly, climbing by more than 16 percent
between 1963 and 1966.  As happened during the 1920s, the share
of the income tax burden borne by the rich increased.  Tax collections
from those making over $50,000 per year climbed by 57 percent
between 1963 and 1966 while tax collections from those earning
below $50,000 rose 11 percent.  As a result, the &quot;rich&quot;
saw their portion of the income tax burden climb from 11.6 percent
to 15.1 percent.
<P>
 Speaking to the Economic Club in New York in December of 1962,
President Kennedy articulated the principles that also have guided
the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform.  He
stated that, &quot;Our true choice is not between tax reduction,
on the one hand, and the avoidance of large Federal deficits on
the other.  It is increasingly clear that ... an economy hampered
by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenues to
balance our budget just as it will never produce enough jobs or
enough profits.  Surely the lesson of the last decade is that
budget deficits are not caused by wild-eyed spenders but by slow
economic growth and periodic recessions and any new recession
would break all deficit records.  In short, it is a paradoxical
truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too
low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run
is to cut the rates now.&quot;
<P>
<B>Looking at the evidence: The 1980s and beyond</B>
<P>
 President Reagan presided over two major pieces of tax legislation
which together reduced the top individual income tax rate from
70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent by 1988.  Beginning in January
of 1983, income tax revenues climbed dramatically, increasing
by more than 54 percent by 1989 (28 percent after adjusting for
inflation).  The share of income taxes paid by the top 10 percent
of earners jumped significantly, climbing from 48.0 percent in
1981 to 57.2 percent in 1988.  The top 1 percent saw their share
of the income tax bill climb even more dramatically, from 17.6
percent in 1981 to 27.5 percent in 1988.
<P>
 The imposition of higher tax rates in recent years, however,
has resulted in a weaker economy.  Ironically, even though tax
rate increases in 1990 and 1993 were supposed to make the &quot;rich&quot;
pay more, the rate increases have backfired.  In 1991, for instance,
income taxes paid by those earning more than $200,000 fell by
6.1 percent while income taxes paid by those with lower earnings
rose by 1 percent.  The adverse consequences of the 1990 tax increase
are being matched by similar evidence from the 1993 tax increase.
 According to recently-released IRS data, taxable income among
those with earnings of less than $200,000 climbed by 3.3 percent
between 1992 and 1993.  For those with earnings over $200,000,
however, taxable income declined by 2.3 percent.
<P>
 The combination of the two record tax increases has been particularly
discouraging.  The deficit is higher today than it was when President
Reagan left office.  It may turn out that deficits are higher
because tax increases caused revenues to fall.  Consider this
evidence: Individual income tax revenues totaled 8.6 percent of
economic output in 1989.  By 1994 -- two large tax increases later
-- individual income tax revenues had fallen to 8.2 percent of
economic output. 
<P>
 It is said that those who forget history's mistakes are doomed
to repeat them.  Conversely, those who recognize the successes
of the past will be better positioned to move the country forward
in the future. The commission's report can point the way to build
on the successes of previous improvements in tax policy.

<h2>BENEFITS OF A SINGLE TAX RATE SYSTEM</h2>
by Daniel Mitchell
</center><P>
<blockquote>
 The widespread recognition that high tax rates hinder economic
growth has contributed to the growing support for tax reform.
 Does this mean, however, that a new tax system cannot have more
than one rate?  If low tax rates are important, then would not
a tax code with rates of 10 percent and 20 percent be just as
good as a flat tax of 15 percent?  And would not a system with
rates of 15 percent and 20 percent be better than a flat tax of
20 percent?
<P>
 In fact, there are substantial benefits from a single rate system
in terms of fairness, stability, and simplicity, as the following
discussion makes clear.
<P>
<I><B>A single rate defines fairness:</B></I> At hearings across
the country the Commission heard one theme repeated over and over
again.  People do not want special privileges, but neither do
they want special penalties.  By an overwhelming margin, citizens
want taxpayers to be treated equally.  In the 14th Amendment,
states are prohibited from denying persons within their jurisdiction
&quot;equal protection of the laws.&quot; The same principle should
hold for the tax code.  If one taxpayers has ten times as much
taxable income as his neighbor, he should pay ten times as much
in taxes.  Not twenty times as much, which is what happens when
a discriminatory rate structure is imposed.  But neither should
the taxpayer with ten times the income get away with paying only
five times as much in taxes, which is what happens when the tax
code is vulnerable to clever machinations by lawyers, lobbyists,
and accountants.
<P>
<I><B>A single rate promotes efficiency and growth:  </B></I>Taxing
all potential producers of additional goods and services at the
same tax rate gives everyone an equal incentive to add to the
output of the economy.  The current graduated rate system imposes
higher tax rates the more one produces and discourages those who
are most efficient.  It particularly discourages people from taking
risks and making innovations and investments that could lead to
the greatest economic rewards not only for themselves but for
workers and consumers as well.
<P>
<I><B>A single rate is progressive:</B></I> All taxpayers should
be able to protect some level of income from taxation.  Whatever
this amount is called -- a zero-bracket amount, a family allowance,
or a personal exemption -- it represents an economic &quot;head-start&quot;
that permits taxpayers to satisfy the basic requirements of food,
clothing, and shelter before the tax collector demands a share.
 One result of this &quot;head-start&quot; is that it builds progressivity
into the single rate system.  Low income taxpayers would have
a bigger share of their income exempted from taxes, and would
enjoy a lower average tax rate, than higher income taxpayers.
 Above the exempt amount, a single rate tax would be proportional:
 a taxpayer with ten times the income of his neighbor would pay
ten times as much in taxes.
<P>
<I><B>A single rate will make it harder for future politicians
to undo tax reform:</B></I>  Witnesses expressed concern over
and over again that the Congress not repeat the mistakes of the
1986 Tax Reform Act.  That law, taxpayers complained, was supposed
to reform the tax code by eliminating deductions and giving taxpayers
lower rates, but by 1993 top tax rates had crept much of the way
back up to the pre-1986 levels.  One reason why the 1986 Act proved
so unstable was that it never achieved a single rate.  As a result,
taxpayers were subject to the old divide-and-conquer game.  Single
rate systems, by contrast, are much more stable.  In 1994, for
instance, Massachusetts voters were given an opportunity to replace
the state's flat tax with a so-called progressive system.  The
voters of the state rejected the proposal by a landslide margin
of 71 percent.  They knew that once the state had the opportunity
to tax one group at a higher rate, it would only be a matter of
time before all taxpayers wound up paying more.  The same political
dynamic will take place if there is a single rate tax at the federal
level.
<P>
<I><B>A single rate eliminates the marriage penalty:</B></I> Under
current law, the first dollar of income for a non-working spouse
who enters the labor market is taxed as if it were additional
income for the primary earner.  In a system of graduated rates,
this means that incomes that normally would be subject to marginal
tax rates of 15 percent are actually being taxed at rates of 28
percent or more.  This policy undermines work incentives, reduces
employment, and lowers tax revenues.  Needless to say, it is also
unfair to married couples.
<P>
<I><B>A single rate avoids tax timing problem:</B></I>  Many taxpayers,
including farmers and small business owners, have volatile incomes.
In a single rate system, they are not punished if their income
is sharply higher in one year than another.  In a system of discriminatory
graduated tax rates, however, they suffer if their income is received
unevenly.  Under graduated rates, people who can do so have an
incentive to engage in costly end-of-year exercises to ensure
that income is reported in the tax year where it will be subject
to lower rates.  Just the opposite occurs with deductions.  A
small business owner may delay or hasten the purchase of some
equipment depending on whether last year's, this year's, or next
year's income is subject to a lower tax rate.  All this complexity
disappears with a single rate system.
<P>
 Fairness, simplicity, and growth all require a new tax system
that taxes income only once and does so at a low, single rate.
 The most profound argument for one rate, however, is trust. 
Tax reform represents a compact with the American people, one
that taxpayers could be reluctant to embrace after what happened
in 1986 and beyond.  In order to ensure that a new tax system
will not be undermined and destroyed by future politicians, it
must be extremely hard to change.  This, more than any other reason,
is why one rate is so necessary.

<h2>TAXES ON THE POOR</h2>
By Bruce Bartlett<P>
</center>
<blockquote>
 Some of the highest implicit tax rates fall on poor individuals
as they try to work their way off welfare.  Not only do they have
to pay taxes on the income that they earn, but they also have
their welfare benefits reduced.  This reduction in benefits is
a de facto tax, because it reduces their net income the same way
direct taxes do.
<P>
 Depending on the precise combination of earnings, taxes and benefits,
a welfare mother can easily face marginal tax rates of over 100
percent.  That is, she pays in taxes and loses in benefits $1
or more for each additional dollar she might earn.  Obviously,
this is a severe disincentive to work and get off welfare.
<P>
 The table illustrates the problem, using, as an example, figures
for the state of Pennsylvania.  As one can see, a single mother
with two children would receive $7,548 in benefits if she had
zero earnings.  If she goes out and earns $2,000, the combination
of taxes and lower benefits raises her disposable income by just
$1,375.  This is equivalent to a tax rate of 31.25 percent on
the earnings.
<P>
 However, on the range of earnings between $5,000 and $8,000 per
year, the marginal tax rate rises to well over 80 percent.  In
other words, out of each additional dollar she earns, her disposable
income rises by less than 20 cents.  Thus a woman earning $8,000
per year is just $2,408 better off than the woman earning nothing.
 This is equivalent to an effective tax rate of 70 percent.
<P>
 Similar situations arise across the country, with only the degree
varying from state to state.
<P>
 De facto marginal tax rates are inherent in the nature of all
means-tested welfare programs.  The more quickly benefits are
phased-out, the higher the tax rate.  Reducing benefits gradually
reduces the tax rate, but necessarily raises the level of earnings
one can have and still receive benefits.
<P>
 The Congress is making a major effort to reform welfare to enable
states to try alternative systems, and this is commendable.  However,
the best answer to this problem is strong economic growth and
 a sharp increase in higher paying jobs.  Other steps, such as
deductibility of payroll taxes to ease that tax's burden on low
income workers, would be helpful as well.

<TITLE>Why Capital Matters -- TRC</TITLE>

<h2>WHY CAPITAL MATTERS</h2> 
By Stephen Moore</center><P>
<blockquote>
Capital is the engine of a growing economy. A recent study by
Dale Jorgenson, chairman of the Department of Economics at Harvard
University, showed that almost half of the growth of the American
economy between 1948 and 1980 was directly attributable to the
increase in U.S. capital formation (with most of the rest a result
of increases and improvements in the labor force).(1)
<P>
It is common to think of capital as money, such as dollars invested
in the stock market or in a business. To economists, capital refers
to investments in physical capital, such as buildings and machines,
as well as human capital -- investments in time and tuition in
acquiring valuable skills. Factories, office buildings, computers,
tractors and trucks are all capital investments that increase
the economy's ability to produce and distribute more and better
goods and services to consumers at the lowest possible cost.
<P>
The ultimate source of capital improvement is the human mind.
America's greatest economic asset is our people. Knowledge is
capital. Invention is capital. Technological improvement is capital.
The spirit of entrepreneurship is capital. The spark of an idea
that leads to a new business or a new way of doing things is capital.
Ten years ago when Bill Gates decided to form a computer softwear
company and then invented MS-DOS, he was creating capital. So
were the original investors who put money behind Microsoft. Thanks
to the vision of Bill Gates and the risk-taking of his investors,
Microsoft is now a globally dominant American firm employing 15,000
U.S. workers at high wages.
<P>
Between 1900 and 1990 real wages in the United States have risen
about six-fold. In other words, a worker today earns as much in
ten minutes as a worker in 1900 earned in an hour. What explains
this surge in the living standards of the American worker? Primarily
capital and productivity. U.S. workers are more productive, and
their real wages are higher than that of workers in most other
nations, because America has one of the highest ratios of capital
per worker in the world.
<P>
Farming is a clear example. Today, the American farmer is by far
the most productive in the world. Imagine what would happen to
the productivity and output of American farmers today if they
lacked modern irrigation systems, tractors, combines, and other
sophisticated farm machinery. They would be no more productive
than farmers in the poorest agrarian countries. Modern farm equipment
and techniques are forms of capital.
<P>
Punitive taxes on capital are often advocated out of a misplaced
belief that the returns from capital accrue primarily to the presumably
wealthy owners of capital, such as stockholders or owners of businesses.
To the extent that tax policy discourages capital accumulation,
however, productivity and real wages will stagnate or decline.
Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson explained the process as follows:
<P>
What happens to the wage rate when each person works with more
capital goods? Because each worker has more capital to work with,
his or her marginal product [or productivity] rises. Therefore,
the competitive real wage rises as workers become worth more to
capitalists and meet with spirited bidding up of their market
wage rates.(2)
<P>
Figure 1 confirms that capital formation is the key ingredient
to rising wages. Over the past fifty years, 90 percent of the
variation in real wages is explained by the ratio of capital to
labor. When there is more capital per worker, wages rise. Whenever
the ratio of capital worker stops rising, wages stagnate. When
capital taxes are running high and investment capital grows scarce,
the last areas that will receive funds from the shrinking investment
pool will be low-income, inner city neighborhoods.
<P>
Human capital is also critical to increasing productivity and
living standards. Sophisticated, high-tech equipment requires
skilled workers, and skilled workers need the best equipment.
Human capital includes education, training, and experience. If
workers are more skilled, they will produce more and thus command
higher salaries.
<P>
Under current law, those who save and invest in business capital
are subjected to numerous overlapping taxes on corporate earnings,
dividends, capital gains, and estates. Those who invest time and
money in improving their own human capital are subjected to the
highest marginal tax rates during their peak earning years. By
discouraging improvements in physical and human capital, such
tax policies slow the growth of the economy and of real wages.

<h2>ESTIMATES VS. REALITY</h2> 
By Alan Reynolds</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
Efforts to reform the tax system to promote efficiency and growth
and to raise the incomes of all Americans have continually been
thwarted by seriously deficient estimates of the revenue cost
to the federal government. Revenue estimates tend to be &quot;static&quot;
in the sense that they routinely ignore the effect of tax changes
on the level of total economic activity -- on the aggregate production,
employment, and income of the population. Consequently, they overstate
the revenue loss from tax rate reductions which can trigger substantial
economic growth, and overstate the revenue gains from tax rate
increases which can depress economic activity. Revenue estimators
also tend to understate the degree to which people can avoid taxes
by reducing the percent of their income taken in taxable form
or altering the timing of their income.
<P>
Before taking such estimates too seriously, it is prudent to keep
in mind the following warnings of Don Fullerton of the University
of Virginia:
<P>
First, each revenue estimate is only an estimate. It is an imperfect
best guess made by an arbitrarily assigned estimator who uses
old data, a set of arbitrary assumptions, and error-prone computer
calculations. A different estimator could easily make other reasonable
assumptions and get a different answer.
<P>
Second, these revenue estimates are always relative to existing
law, as if that were some valuable standard by which to judge
all changes. There is nothing absolute about current law, for
that is why changes are being considered in the first place.(1)
<P>
<B>Why We Need Dynamic, Not Static Revenue Estimates: Accounting
for Growth</B> 
<P>
A single low marginal tax rate in a system that was not biased
against saving and investment would substantially increase incentives
to work, save, and invest. Professor Dale Jorgenson, chairman
of the economics department at Harvard University, estimates that
such a system could ultimately boost the annual output of the
economy by about 15-20% on a permanent basis. Note that an increase
of that magnitude would bring in substantial additional revenue
to the federal government, enough to lower the tax rate by several
percentage points. Failure to take these revenues into account
would discourage tax reform and block the potential gains in income
and employment. Just as static revenue estimates invariably exaggerate
any revenue loss from lower tax rates, they likewise exaggerate
the revenue gains from higher tax rates.(2) Relying on the estimates
thus introduces a stubborn statistical bias in favor of higher
tax rates.
<P>
So many potentially important revenue-increasing effects of a
new tax system are completely ignored in the process of estimating
tax receipts that it makes little sense to demand that a new tax
system be &quot;revenue neutral&quot; in this static sense --
as defined by government bookkeepers. The current tax system is
suffocating the economy and encouraging tax avoidance and evasion.
A tax system conducive to more rapid economic growth and reduced
tax avoidance will generate far more revenue over time than the
current law.
<P>
Past experience with static revenue estimates should generate
some healthy skepticism. From 1981 to 1988, the highest tax rate
fell from 70% to 28%, and rates were generally reduced across
the board. Estimates prepared before the tax reduction suggested
that revenue growth would be impaired. Yet, measured in constant
1987 dollars, federal revenues were $916.2 billion in 1989, up
27% from $719.2 billion in 1979, the peak of the previous economic
expansion. In 1993, by contrast, real revenues were only $921.9
billion, barely changed from the 1989 level.(3)
<P>
Where tax rates were increased by the 1986 law, on the other hand,
revenues came in far below the estimates. In 1987 dollars, revenue
from the capital gains tax jumped from $28 billion in 1985 to
$54.3 billion in 1986. By 1990-93, however, real capital gains
tax receipts averaged only $24.6 billion per year.(4) Federal
revenues from the individual income tax <I>declined </I>from 8.6%
of GDP in 1989 to 8.2% in 1994, after two seemingly large increases
in individual tax rates in 1990 and 1993.
<P>
It is still commonly believed that lowering the highest tax rates
would lower revenues, with the result that middle incomes would
supposedly bear a larger share of the burden. Yet the experience
of the United States, Britain and other nations is the exact opposite:
Reducing unnecessarily high tax rates greatly <I>increases</I>
the amount collected at higher incomes, and thereby allows more
generous tax relief for those with middle or lower incomes.(5)
Again, estimates prepared prior to the 1981 tax cuts, which reduced
the highest tax rates from 70% to 28% suggested that less revenue
would be collected from those with higher incomes. By 1988, however,
the top 1% of taxpayers were actually paying 27.5% of all individual
income tax -- up from 17.6% in 1981.
<P>
Revenue estimators object to having their methods described as
&quot;static.&quot; They point out, correctly, that they do take
into account the fact that a higher excise tax will reduce sales
of the taxed product, or that a higher capital gains tax will
reduce the amount of gains that are realized each year -- but
always assuming an unchanged level of total employment and gross
domestic product (GDP). But this was never what the critics meant
by static revenue estimates. When economists outside the government
refer to &quot;dynamic&quot; revenue effects, they mean that lower
marginal tax rates and less hostile taxation of saving and investment
will increase total GDP. They will increase GDP by increasing
the percentage of adults who are willing to work, the intensity
and skill of work, the amount of personal and business saving,
the amount of investment (including investment in education),
risk-taking by entrepreneurs and investors, and the efficiency
with which labor and capital are used.
<P>
Congressional Budget Office economists William Randolph and Diane
Lim Rogers recently surveyed some recent evidence on the impact
of taxation, concluding that avoiding &quot;accounting for saving
and labor-supply behavior. . . cannot be justified based on existing
studies.&quot;(6) So why are such effects nonetheless routinely
ignored? The usual explanation is tradition and convention. &quot;Traditional
estimating conventions,&quot; explains a recent report from the
Joint Committee on Taxation, &quot;assume that tax law changes
will have no overall effect on economic aggregates such as gross
domestic product (GDP).&quot;
<P>
&quot;Following the standard revenue estimating conventions,&quot;
says a memo from the Office of Tax Analysis, &quot;the macroeconomic
aggregates, such as the level of compensation, prices, employment,
and gross domestic product, have been assumed to be unchanged
by the proposal.&quot;(7)
<P>
Estimates have always been done this way. It is indeed standard,
conventional and traditional. When it comes to estimating the
impact of an entirely new system, however, such an appeal to orthodoxy
is fatally flawed. Imagine using these estimating conventions
to estimate the impact of replacing income taxes with a national
sales tax. If prices were &quot;assumed to be unchanged by the
proposal,&quot; then how could businesses recoup the cost of a
new sales tax? If they did so by cutting wages, how could compensation
or employment be &quot;assumed to be unchanged&quot;? If pricesare assumed to not rise and wages assumed to not fall, then this
hypothetical sales tax must initially fall entirely on profits.
In that case, how could investment and GDP be &quot;assumed to
be unchanged&quot;? When it comes to estimating the impact of
entirely new tax systems, the conventional conventions are not
simply misleading but meaningless. They put aside all of the most
important questions by assuming them out of existence.
<P>
Revenue estimators sometimes excuse the fact that economic consequences
are ignored in the aggregate by the assertion that most benefits
will take more than five years to fully take effect, which is
beyond the usual budget planning period. Ignoring the long-run
benefits from a less hostile policy toward working and saving
is even more risky than pretending the effects do not exist. Myopic
revenue estimates may thwart sound policies that are most likely
to generate the most revenue in the long run, in favor of gimmicks
that might <I>appear</I> to raise estimated revenue in the short
run, while eventually losing revenue by damaging economic growth.
<P>
By increasing the incentive and ability to save, and to invest
time and money in education and training, a tax system that taxes
income only once, and does so at a single low rate, will greatly
enlarge and improve the economy's stock of capital and human capital.
That, in turn, will raise output per worker (productivity) and
thus increase real wages. None of these effects are ever considered
in revenue estimates or distribution tables. Tax burdens are distributed
based on <I>existing</I> incomes, for example, even though making
it easier to <I>increase</I> income and wealth is a major objective
of a new tax system.
<P>
It may not yet be technically feasible to estimate the <I>exact</I>
impact of tax policy<B> </B>on savings, employment, interest rates
and production. It is, however, possible to estimate the <I>direction</I>
and general magnitude of such effects through the use of models
that appropriately account for the manner in which tax changes
alter incentives to supply labor and capital. At a minimum, traditional,
static estimates should carry explicit warning labels about what
is left out of the calculations, and an informed judgment about
the direction and likely magnitude of the resulting errors.(8)
<P>
A savings-neutral tax with a single low rate will result in a
very significant, sustained increase in the amount of income that
is both earned and reported.(9) If &quot;traditional&quot; (static)
estimates conclude that this or that specific single tax rate
would be &quot;revenue neutral,&quot; experience teaches that
such a rate would most likely result in a very substantial <I>increase
</I>in real tax receipts over time.(10)
<P>
<B>Why We Need Dynamic, Not Static Revenue Estimates: Reporting
More Income and Reducing Tax Avoidance</B> 
<P>
The federal income tax on individuals has <I>always</I> hovered
around 9-10% of personal income ever since the Korean War -- regardless
of whether the top tax rate was 92% or 28%, and regardless of
whether so-called loopholes were opened or closed. From 1951 to
1994, receipts from the individual income tax have never been
lower than 9% of personal income, and briefly reached 11% in only
two recession years, 1969 and 1981.(11)
<P>
Since the federal tax on individual incomes has been almost constant
as a percentage of personal income, the revenue yield from this
tax mostly depends on (1) the proportion of personal income that
is reported and taxed, and (2) the growth of personal income.
High, graduated tax rates are damaging in both respects. High
tax rates encourage people to minimize the proportion of income
that is reported as taxable, and also to avoid doing any extra
working or saving that would cause personal (and national) income
to rise. In 1993, individual income taxes brought in only 9.2%
of personal income, down from 10.1% in 1988. Growth of real GDP
also slowed from 3.8% a year in 1983-89 to only 2.5% from the
second quarter of 1991 to the third quarter of 1995.(12)
<P>
Revenue estimates rarely take much notice, if any, of the well
documented fact that higher tax rates increase tax avoidance and
evasion, and lower tax rates reduce the incentive to maximize
deductions or to cheat. There are many ways in which people can
minimize the proportion of income that is reported as taxable.
These behavior changes need to be taken into account in the revenue
estimates.
<P>
Taxable income in 1992 was only 46.5% of all personal income,
down from 50.8% in 1988. The wider gap between personal income
and taxable income partly reflects more intense use of deductions,
including the expanded earned income tax credits. High tax rates
also increase the incentive to become more aggressive in seeking
legal and illegal ways to minimize the tax bite. And high tax
rates increase the attractiveness of tax-financed entitlements,
compared with taxable work and saving. Government transfer payments
(most of which are taxed lightly, if at all) rose from 14.3% of
personal income in 1989 to 16.9% in 1994. With a single, low tax
rate, people will have much less incentive to take their income
in ways that escape taxes (including transfer payments and the
underground economy), and much more incentive to earn more.
<P>
Revenue estimates rarely consider the fact that what happens to
one tax is likely to alter behavior and affect revenues from another
tax. Douglas Bernheim has shown that reduction of the tax rate
on estates can be expected to increase revenues from the individual
income tax, due to reduced incentives for aggressive estate planning.(13)
Since tax proposals are usually examined one at a time, &quot;general
equilibrium&quot; questions about the eventual impact on the entire
tax base are neglected. This can be a serious problem when evaluating
proposals to completely rebuild the tax system. Partly because
of widespread tax arbitrage, Roger Gordon and Joel Slemrod estimated
that &quot;abandoning entirely any attempt to tax capital income
. . . would have resulted in a slight <I>rise </I>in government
revenue.&quot;(14) Gordon and Slemrod found that the<I> apparent</I>
reduction in revenue from eliminating all capital taxes would
be more than offset by increased revenue from other taxes. Traditional
revenue estimates would not reveal such an effect, which creates
a systematic bias against reducing or eliminating inefficient
taxes.
<P>
Another source of estimating bias is the practical necessity of
ignoring effects that are difficult to measure. It is well known
that a capital-importing country like the U.S. can collect more
revenue from a territorial tax system than under the current residence-based
system.(15) However, there is no past experience to use in making
a reliable estimate of exactly how much more revenue a territorial
system may yield. Whenever there is no sound basis for making
an estimate, such complex effects are usually ignored. When switching
to an entirely new system, nearly every change is without precedent.
That means what is ignored is likely to be more important than
what is counted.
<P>
Even aside from the impact of a new tax system on capital formation
and work incentives (which estimators <I>always </I>ignore), there
are many potentially important ways in which various alternatives
to the current tax regime might be expected to increase tax revenues.
Because there is no precedent, however, these revenue-improving
effects are inherently difficult to quantify. They include: (1)
improving compliance by reducing complexities; (2) reducing the
incentive and opportunity to maximize deductions and other avoidance
devices; and (3) ending opportunities to avoid taxes by setting
up different types of business entities, or by shifting income
into low-tax years and deductible expenses into high-tax years.
Because even such &quot;microeconomic&quot; issues are hard to
quantify, they are unlikely to be considered in estimates of revenues.
<P>
Estimates of revenues and tax burdens employ models <I>based on
past experience</I> to predict or &quot;simulate&quot; what would
happen under an entirely different tax structure and tax rate.
When it comes to major changes in the tax structure and rates,
very little can be estimated on the basis of past experience.
Nobel Laureate Robert Lucas demonstrated that such statistical
exercises are inherently flawed, because human behavior under
one system will be quite different under another. &quot;Simulations
using these models can, in principle, provide<I> no </I>useful
information as to the actual consequences of alternative economic
policies,&quot; wrote Professor Lucas, &quot;[These] kinds of
policy simulations . . . are meaningless.&quot;(16)

<h2>TAX BIASES AGAINST SAVING AND INVESTMENT AND HOW TO FIX THEM</h2> 
By Stephen Entin</center>
<blockquote><P>
<B>Tax biases on income that is saved: four layers of tax.</B>

<P>
The income tax hits income that is saved and invested much harder
than income used for consumption. The income tax is imposed on
income that is saved and again on the income produced by the saving.
In contrast, the income tax falls on income used for consumption
but does not fall again on the consumption spending and the services
and enjoyment it provides.
<P>
For example, if one uses after-tax income to buy a bond, the stream
of interest payments is also taxed. If one uses after-tax income
to buy a television, there is no additional tax on the purchase
of the TV or the stream of entertainment it provides.
<P>
In fact, people who save and invest find their income subject
to four layers of federal tax (versus one layer for consumption).
<P>
<I>Layer 1 -- tax on earnings.</I> The income is taxed when first
earned.
<P>
<I>Layer 2 -- tax on interest and business income.</I> When the
after-tax income is saved, the returns on the saving are taxed
-- double taxation. If the saver puts his or her income into a
bond or bank account, the interest earned is taxed. If the saver
invests directly in a small business, his or her investment income
from the proprietorship or partnership is taxed. If the saver
buys a share of corporate stock, he or she is in fact buying a
share of the company, a claim to a share of its income, and his
or her share of the corporate income tax on the corporate earnings.
<P>
<I>Layer 3 --taxes on dividends and capital gains.</I> Shareholders
face triple taxation. In addition to the original tax on the saving
and the tax paid by the corporation, shareholders must pay personal
income tax on any dividends that the corporation distributes out
of its after-tax income. (This is sometimes called &quot;the double
taxation of dividends&quot;, but it is really the third layer
of tax because the income used to buy the shares was taxed before
it was saved.)
<P>
There is a third layer of income tax even if the corporation does
not pay a dividend. If a corporation (or other business) retains
its after-tax earnings for reinvestment, the earning power and
the value of the business will increase. If the owner or shareholder
sells the business or the shares, the increase in value is taxed
as a capital gain.
<P>
Capital gains can arise whenever a business's prospects improve,
not just because of reinvestment of previously-taxed earnings.
The development of a successful new product, or a discovery such
as a new wonder drug or a new oil field, can the boost the after-tax
earnings outlook of a business and increase its current market
value. If the higher expected business earnings come to pass,
they will be taxed as corporate income and/or unincorporated business
or personal income. To tax as well the increase in the business's
current value if the business or the shares are sold is to double-tax
the future income of the business before it even occurs, and to
triple-tax the initial saving.(1) The current law income tax treatment
of capital gains, whatever their source, is multiple taxation
of saving.(2)
<P>
<I>Layer 4 -- estate and gift taxes.</I> If the saving outlives
the saver, and the remaining unspent assets exceed a modest exempt
amount, the federal unified transfer (estate and gift) tax imposes
another layer of federal tax on the already multiply-taxed saving.
<P>
<B>Ending the tax biases against saving and investment</B> 
<P>
These tax biases are real and they have serious consequences.
Savers and investors expect a reasonable after-tax return on their
assets. Because of these biases, saving and investment must earn
substantially higher returns to cover the added taxes and still
be worthwhile substitutes for consumption. Saving and investment
earn higher returns only if the quantity of capital is significantly
reduced, making the value of each additional unit's output that
much greater. The current biases in the tax treatment of capital
have cost the economy several trillion dollars in saving and investment,
considerably retarding the growth of productivity, wages, and
employment, and retarding the growth of individual income and
wealth. It is no exaggeration to suggest that the level of income
in the United States could be at least 15% to 20% higher than
it is today if these biases did not exist. That missing income
has simply been thrown away to no good purpose. These losses could
amount to as much as $4,000 to $6,000 per year for typical middle
income families. The current system also cripples people's ability
and incentive to save for retirement, leaving people with less
retirement income than they need to be financially secure, and
increasing their dependence on government programs or their children
in old age.
<P>
Making the tax system even-handed or neutral between saving and
investment, on the one hand, and consumption on the other, requires
several steps.
<P>
<I>The transfer tax on estates and gifts must be eliminated.</I>
Most of an estate is saving that has already been taxed. There
is no justice in taxing it again. Those elements of an estate
that consisted of tax deferred saving should remain tax deferred
so long as the heirs continue to save it. The current harsh treatment
of estates makes elderly people fearful of holding onto their
assets. Forcing them to divest their assets does them no service.
The modest exempt amount in current law, $600,000, is a sum of
money that would be wiped out in a decade if an elderly couple
required nursing home care.
<P>
<I>The dual taxation of corporate income at the corporate and
individual level must be eliminated through &quot;integration&quot;
of the individual and corporate income taxes (or the substitution
of a non-income type of tax system).</I> Integration means that
corporate income is recognized as belonging to the shareholders,
and is taxed either on individual tax returns or corporate tax
returns, but not both.
<P>
<I>The tax system must either allow savers to deduct saving or
to exclude the returns on saving from taxable income. There must
be no separate, additional taxation of capital gains. Investment
outlays must be deducted in the year the outlay is made (expensed)
rather than depreciated over time.</I> Deducting saving and taxing
the returns, as is done to a limited degree with pensions and
IRAs, is one way to eliminate the basic tax bias against saving.
Another method is to treat saving as we now treat tax exempt bonds;
there is no deduction of the amount saved, but no taxation of
the interest or other returns. The following section presents
some simple examples to illustrate how a tax bias arises if these
rules are broken, and why these treatments are the correct ones.
<P>
<U><I><B>Neutral treatment of income used for saving and consumption</B></I></U>

<P>
The income tax, by taxing both income that is saved and the returns
on that income, taxes saving and investment more heavily than
consumption. There are two ways to restore neutrality. One approach
is to exclude saving from taxable income while taxing all returns
on the saving. The other is to include saving in taxable income
but impose no tax on the returns.
<P>
<I>Deduct saving, tax returns method.</I> Excluding (or deducting)
saving and investment from taxable income is called &quot;expensing&quot;.
In the case of saving, expensing is akin to the tax-deferred treatment
allowed limited amounts of retirement saving today (as with current
IRAs, 401(k) plans, 403 (b) plans, SEPs, and Keogh plans), but
with no restrictions on the amount of saving that could be deducted,
no penalty tax on withdrawal at any age, and no forced distribution
at any age. In effect, the purchase of a bond, bank account, or
share of stock would be recognized as a cost of earning income.
When the outlay is made, it would be deducted. When the returns
come in, they would be taxed (including interest, dividends, the
return of the principal when the bond matures, or the proceeds
from the sale of the stock at a later date).
<P>
<I>Tax saving, exempt returns method.</I> The other route to neutrality
is to tax the income that is to be saved, but exempt interest,
dividends, capital gains, and other returns on the saving from
tax. This is akin to the tax treatment accorded state and local
tax exempt bonds. No deduction for buying the asset is allowed,
but the returns are not taxed.
<P>
Both methods of dealing with saving eliminate the excess tax on
income that is saved compared to income that is used for consumption.
A tax increases the cost of whatever item or activity it is imposed
upon. The income tax is biased because it raises the cost of saving
and investment more than it raises the cost of consumption. Let's
look at how much more a person must earn to support a given level
of consumption after a tax is imposed, compared to how much more
must be earned to buy an asset that delivers a given amount of
after-tax income.
<P>
Suppose that, if there were no income tax, one could buy $100
of consumption goods or a $100 bond paying 4% interest, or $4
a year. Now impose a 20% income tax. One would have to earn $125,
and give up $25 in tax, to have $100 of after-tax income to consume.
The pre-tax cost of $100 of consumption has risen 25%. To get
a $4 interest stream, after taxes, one would have to earn $5 in
interest, pre-tax. But $5 in interest requires a $125 bond. To
buy a $125 bond, one would have to earn $156.25 and pay $31.25
in tax. The cost of the after-tax interest stream has gone up
56.25%, more than twice the increase in the cost of consumption.
(See table.) Put another way, if there were no income tax, obtaining
a $1 stream of interest would cost the saver $25 in current consumption
($100/$4). After the income tax, it would take $156.25 to buy
a $4 interest stream or $125 of consumption. Each $1 interest
stream would cost $31.25 in foregone consumption ($125/$4), 25%
more than in the no-tax situation.
<P>
There are two ways to restore neutradity. One is to exempt interest
from tax, as with state and local tax exempt bonds. One would
then have to earn $125 to buy a $100 bond, earning $4 with no
further tax. The other method is to allow a deduction for income
that is saved, while taxing the returns, as with a deductible
IRA. One would have to earn $125 to buy a $125 bond, earning $5
in interest pre-tax, and, after paying $1 in tax on the interest,
have $4 left.(3)
<P>
<center>
<B>Income Tax Bias Against Saving and Two Cures</B><br>
<img src="rpt5.gif" alt="Chart"></center>
<P>
<B>Neutral treatment of investment: expensing</B>
<P>
Expensing is the simplest and most sensible way to provide unbiased
tax treatment of direct investment in physical capital. Just as
neutral treatment of saving can be accomplished by deducting saving
and taxing the returns, neutral treatment of investment can be
achieved by expensing investment and taxing the returns. Expensing
means writing off the investment in the year it is purchased rather
than the current practice of stretching out capital consumption
(depreciation) allowances over an extended period of time, which
reduces their value. The stretch-out constitutes an interest-free
loan to the Treasury of the taxes that would otherwise have been
saved by the deduction. Outlays for plant, equipment, buildings
and other structures, land, inventory, and research and development
should all be deductible in the year the outlays are made, just
as for any other production input. Subsequently, all the returns
on these investments, including sales of goods and services, rents,
and royalties (all net of other costs), and sales of assets, should
be taxed.
<P>
Under current law, purchases of equipment are written off over
perigds of time ranging from 3 to 20 years. Most structures are
written off over a 39 year period. Stretching out the write-off
period reduces the present value of the deductions due to lost
interest and inflation. The result is that the business deducts
an amount that is less in present value than the value of the
equipment. The under-depreciation overstates taxable income, resulting
in a higher-than-statutory tax rate on the real earnings of the
asset. The table illustrates the difference in the value of the
deductions between expensing and one of the set of depreciation
schedules commonly used in current law. For example, the present
value of deductions for the 7 year asset at 3% inflation and a
3.5% real discount rate is only 84.6% of the cost of the asset.
The present value falls short of expensing by $15.40 on a $100
piece of equipment, costing the firm an extra $5.39 in tax in
present value terms, assuming a 35% corporate tax rate. The longer
the life of the asset, the greater is the loss of value of the
write-off.(4)<HR>

<P>
Depreciation schedules under the alternative minimum tax (AMT)
are even less favorable than those allowed under the regular income
tax. The AMT is designed to make businesses and individuals pay
some tax each year even if legitimate business deductions reduce
their ordinary taxable income to zero. It must be understood that,
in reality, revenues are not income until they exceed the cost
of producing the income. By holding deductible costs below actual
costs, ordinary depreciation and AMT depreciation schedules overstate
businesses' and individuals' real incomes. When income is overstated
for tax purposes, the tax is a bigger percent of the taxpayer's
true income than the statutory tax rate. The overstatement of
income sometimes turns a real loss into an apparent profit and
forces a tax payment when none should be due.
<P>
A tax system that does not allow full and immediate write offs
for capital costs is biased against investment relative to consumption
and against investment in long lived assets relative to short
lived assets. The current tax treatment of depreciation diverts
economic activity in the United States away from capital intensive
industries such as manufacturing, especially heavy industry, and
into services and less capital intensive production. In the process,
many high value added jobs have been lost.
<P>
Accountants and tax officials often argue for delaying write-offs
to correspond with the gradual decline in an asset's future earning
power as the asset wears out. This so-called &quot;economic depreciation&quot;
is fine for measuring the size of the country's capital stock
and the level of economic capacity, but it has nothing to do with
appropriately measuring the taxable income of an individual or
business, which is revenues less costs. When a business (or its
lenders and shareholders) buys a machine or other asset, it gives
up the resources to pay for it at the moment the payment is made,
not several years later. It must immediately forego all other
possible uses of the money, including earning interest, hiring
labor, buying inventory, or distributing dividends to shareholders
to save or consume as they see fit. Furthermore, the seller of
the machine must take the sales revenue into taxable income immediately.
The asymmetrical treatment by the Treasury of the buyer and the
seller -- partial write-off for the buyer, full taxation of the
purchase price for the seller -- is clearly arbitrary, inappropriate,
and anti-investment. Only expensing measures income correctly,
and imposes the correct amount of tax.

<P>
<B>Notes</B> 
<P>
1. It must be made clear that a capital gain on a bond, stock,
or sale of an unincorporated business or other property is not
an additional amount of income above and beyond the interest or
business income underlying the assets. The current price of an
asset is the value that people put on the future income the asset
will generate after taxes. Asset prices change if the expected
future after-tax earnings change. If a stock's future annual earnings
are expected to be $5 a share before taxes, and (assuming a 20%
tax rate) $4 a share after taxes, and if the &quot;discount rate&quot;
(the rate of return that people demand to receive to compensate
them for the use of their resources and inflation) is 10%, then
the share price will be $40 (because $40 at 10% yields $4 a year).
The $40 stock price is the &quot;present value&quot; of an indefinite
stream of $4 in after-tax future earnings. If the business announces
a new product and its projected income doubles to $10 a share
before tax and $8 after-tax, the share price will about double
to $80. If the earnings projections come true, the additional
$5 in annual income will be taxed, yielding the Treasury an additional
$1 a year. The additional $4 in after-tax future earnings are
worth $40 at the present time. If that $40 jump in the share price
is taxed as a capital gain (an $8 tax at a 20% rate), it constitutes
an extra layer of tax on the additional after-tax future income,
equivalent to raising the tax rate on the $5 pre-tax income stream
from 20% to 36%. (The $8 capital gains tax is equivalent to $.80
a year, on top of the $1 income tax on the earnings. $1.80/$5
= 36%.)
<P>
2. Additional equally unjustified extra layers of tax can sneak
in when corporations hold stock in other companies. If the Company
A holds less than 80% of the stock of Company B, then Company
A must pay tax on 30% of dividends it receives from Company B
before passing the dividends on to its own shareholders for additional
taxation. Any capital gains tax paid by a corporation is also
an unjustified additional layer of tax on saving.
<P>

saving and investment, see: Bradford, David F., et al, <U>Blueprints

4. In theory, the present value of deferred write-offs could be
made equal to expensing by paying appropriate interest on the
write-offs, as in the various &quot;neutral cost recovery systems&quot;
that have been proposed in recent years. Alternatively, a schedule
of investment tax credits could be designed, one for each asset
life, to offset the bias. The former approach is complicated and
the interest rate might not match the discount rate (adjusted
for risk and opportunity cost) of the investor. The latter approach
would require adjusting the ITC every time the inflation rate
changed. Expensing is simple, unbiased, and foolproof.

<h2>GROWTH-FRIENDLY TAX SYSTEMS</h2> 
By Stephen Entin
</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
There are several types of tax systems that successfully exclude
saving and investment or their returns from tax, eliminate the
bias against saving and investment, and simplify the tax system.
These include two types of unbiased income taxes and various types
of sales taxes. Each has advantages and disadvantages, but they
all have one very important point in common: they are all unbiased
taxes on labor and capital income, properly measured, either when
earned or when spent. Whatever direction the tax restructuring
movement takes, it is important to remember that all these approaches
have this great common advantage over current law. All of the
serious tax reform proposals that are being widely discussed around
the country and in Washington employ one or more of these approaches
in some form.
<P>
<I>Saving-deferred income tax.</I> Under the saving-deferred income
tax, all labor and capital income would be taxed once and only
once on individual tax returns. There would be personal exemptions
and a tax rate structure that could be flat or graduated. (The
Commission favors a single rate.)(1) The distinctive feature of
this system is that individuals would exclude their saving from
taxable income; they would include the returns on their saving
-- interest, dividends, and sales of assets -- in taxable income,
but only if the returns were withdrawn for consumption, and not
reinvested. Businesses would deduct their dividend payments as
well as their interest payments, passing them on to shareholders
and lenders for tax purposes. Any remaining capital earnings retained
by the business for reinvestment would be tax deferred on behalf
of the shareholders, and investment would be expensed. Since all
taxable capital income would be reported on individual tax returns,
businesses would not need to file. Further details are presented
below.
<P>
<I>Returns-exempt income tax. </I>The best known example of a
returns-exempt income tax is the single-rate tax proposed by professors
Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka.(2) In its pure form it would have
only one tax rate applicable to income over a large exempt amount,
with no other deductions permitted. Only labor and pension income
would be taxed on individual tax returns. In general, individuals
would not deduct their saving, but would not be taxed on the earnings
of the saving. (In legislative variations of this proposal, contributions
to pensions and other retirement plans would remain deductible,
and the withdrawals taxable, as under current law.) All income
from capital would be taxed once and only once on business tax
returns. Business would expense investment outlays and other costs,
and pay tax on all the returns. Some possible variations of the
tax, allowing some deductions, are presented below.
<P>
<I>Sales tax.</I> Taxes imposed on the sales of goods and services,
such as a retail sales tax or a manufacturers excise tax, allow
individuals to defer tax on their saving until the saving is withdrawn
for consumption. A national retail sales tax, if it were to exclude
investment goods from the sales tax base, would be neutral as
between income used for saving and investment and income used
for consumption.(3)
<P>
<B>The nature of the taxes</B> 
<P>
One point of clarification is in order. Various types of sales
taxes and excise taxes are often referred to as &quot;consumption
taxes&quot;, rather than income taxes, because they are collected
when products are produced or sold. A broadly-imposed national
retail sales tax would fall on an amount of GNP that equals total
consumption. Nonetheless, these are not taxes on the act of consumption
or on the goods and services consumed. Goods and services do not
pay taxes. Only people pay taxes. All taxes, in fact, are taxes
on income. Sales and excise taxes either depress sales of the
taxed products, reducing the incomes of the people who provide
the labor and capital used to make them, or they reduce the purchasing
power of that income when the workers and savers attempt to spend
it.
<P>
The two neutral income-style taxes are imposed on income as it
is earned, with the amount saved and invested excluded (or the
earnings of saving excluded). Saving and investment are outlays
that people make to earn income. There is no real income or profit
from saving and investment until the returns exceed the outlays.
Consequently, taxing that part of the payments to labor and capital
left over after saving and investment is the correct amount of
income from labor and capital to tax. (Alternatively, the saving
should be taxed, and the returns exempted.) These systems are
sometimes called &quot;consumption-based income taxes&quot; or
&quot;saving-deferred income taxes&quot;. Excluding from total
income the amount that is saved and used to finance investment
leaves an amount equal in a given time period to total consumption.
This does not convert the tax into a consumption tax, however;
it is merely a means of avoiding multiple taxation of income used
for saving, and the returns on the saving will be taxed when earned,
unless reinvested in turn. It bears repeating that all taxes are
paid out of income by people, not by businesses, and not by goods
and services.
<P>
<B>Benefits in common -- ending tax biases and promoting simplicity</B>

<P>
Each of these tax systems eliminates the tax bias against saving
and investment found in the current income tax. Each can readily
accommodate a single low tax rate on all taxpayers. Each can substantially
reduce the confusing treatment of foreign source income that cripples
American firms attempting to compete abroad. Each system would
eliminate the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax. The
systems would have expensing instead of depreciation (or equivalent
non-taxation of investment outlays), and no separate taxation
of capital gains. Many of the major sources of complexity in the
current tax code would be gone.
<P>
<B>Some differences to consider</B> 
<P>
While sharing many advantages, some of these tax systems do better
than others when measured against the other important tax policy
considerations. Among these are simplicity, visibility, and fairness.
The integrated saving-deferred income tax and, to a large extent,
the returns-exempt income tax, show the cost of government pretty
clearly, and can easily exempt low-income citizens. Sales taxes
tend to be hidden in the cost of goods and services, making the
cost of government less visible.(4) They are the easiest taxes
for individuals to comply with -- individuals are totally divorced
from the collection process -- but they may go too far in that
regard. Sales taxes also pose some problems with respect to easing
their burden on low income taxpayers and compliance costs of businesses.
Some additional work on these issues is needed. Sales taxes may
be imposed on imports and remitted or not levied on exports. This
feature is called border adjustability, or being &quot;destination-based&quot;.
These taxes may also be set up without border adjustability, in
which case they are called &quot;origin-based&quot;. The question
of border adjustment should not be the determining consideration
in choosing which tax system to adopt.(5)
<P>
<B>A closer look at the saving-deferred tax and returns-exempt
tax</B> 
<P>
Both types of unbiased income tax can be constructed with an exempt
amount for people with low income and a single rate for incomes
above the exempt amount. The single rate would eliminate the graduated
tax rate bias against work, education, risk taking, and success.
Neither would discriminate or double tax income used for saving
and investment. Both would be significantly simpler, over all,
than current law.
<P>
In both systems, all income would be taxed, but only once. The
income from investment -- which belongs to the savers (lenders,
shareholders, and owners of non-corporate business) who financed
the investment -- would be taxed either on the savers' tax returns
after it is distributed by the businesses, or on the businesses'
tax returns before it is distributed to the savers, but not both.
Whichever approach is taken, it would be incorrect to conclude
that capital income was escaping tax because it did not appear
on one tax form or the other. The only reason that income from
capital appears on both types of tax form under current law is
that current law double and triple taxes income that is saved.
<P>
<I>Saving-deferred tax.</I> The theory behind the saving-deferred
tax (also known as a cash flow tax or inflow-outflow tax) is that
all income should be taxed as close to the final recipient of
the income as possible, for maximum visibility. In its pure form,
all inflows (all receipts) would be taxable, and all outflows
(all outlays associated with earning the income, or any income
given away to others, either voluntarily or as a tax) would be
deductible.
<P>
Individuals would pay tax on labor income (wages, salaries, and
the value of fringe benefits), the taxable portion of social security,
and capital income (interest, dividends, pension income). Individuals
would deduct their net saving (including purchases of stocks and
bonds) or pay tax on their net withdrawals (including sales of
assets).(6) There would be no separate calculation of capital
gains; they would be covered in the proceeds from the sale of
assets. Employers and financial institutions would report all
these net amounts to the taxpayers on forms like those currently
in use. Since all saving could be deducted in this system, all
current-law restrictions on the amounts allowed as contributions
and withdrawals under employer-sponsored pension plans should
be eliminated.
<P>
Individuals would deduct personal allowances. In the pure form
of this tax, deductions would include mortgage and other interest
paid, charitable contributions, and, if allowed, the individual
portion of payroll taxes and state and local taxes.(7) These deductions
would be over and above the personal allowances.
<P>
There would be no separate taxation of businesses in a saving-deferred
tax. Interest and dividends would be deductible by businesses
in this tax system, passed on to lenders and shareholders to be
taxed. The remaining earnings retained by the business for reinvestment
would be treated as tax deferred saving by the shareholders or
other owners. These deductions would exhaust the earnings.(8)
<P>
In this system, the deduction for business investment would effectively
be passed along to the savers who lend money to, buy shares in,
or otherwise invest in the business. Savers would deduct their
purchases of stocks and bonds. These proceeds of stock and bond
issues, plus retained earnings, would be treated as taxable inflows
to a business, but these sources of financing must just equal
the (deductible) capital investment and net saving of the business,
eliminating taxable business income. Consequently, there would
be no need for businesses to file an income tax return, eliminating
most of the accounting, auditing, and costs of enforcement and
compliance in the current tax system.
<P>
In a sense, businesses would be treated like pensions or IRAs
owned by the savers: all income individuals transfer to businesses
through lending or the purchase of shares would be deductible
by the savers; only those business earnings distributed to lenders
and shareholders (and not reinvested) would be taxable, and would
be reported on the individual tax returns.
<P>
<I>Returns-exempt or modified Hall-Rabushka tax.</I> The returns-exempt
income tax would impose a single tax rate above a generous exempt
amount. This system achieves simplification and unbiased treatment
of saving by taxing only labor and pension income on individual
tax returns and taxing all other income from capital on business
returns. There would be no need for businesses, individuals, or
the IRS to track the payments of capital income from businesses
to taxpayers. This method of achieving simplicity reduces the
visibility of the tax on capital.
<P>
In one relatively pure form of the returns-exempt income tax,
individuals who work would pay tax on wages, salaries, and the
value of non-pension fringe benefits. Retirees would pay tax only
on pension income (the only saving-related income taxed on individual
returns). Social security benefits would not be taxable. There
would generally be no deduction for non-pension saving, and no
tax on the returns on the individual tax form. For simplicity,
and to keep the tax rate low, the only deductions for individuals
would be for a generous personal allowance and, possibly, liberalized
pension plan contributions.(9) Since all saving is to receive
neutral treatment in this system, it would make sense to eliminate
all current-law restrictions on the amounts allowed as contributions
and withdrawals under employer-sponsored pension plans.
<P>
In that same form of the tax, businesses would pay taxes on returns
to capital before they are distributed to lenders, shareholders,
or other owners (except for pension distributions taxed on individual
returns). Businesses would not deduct interest or dividend payments,
and would not pay tax on interest and dividends received. Deductions
for fringe benefits and state and local taxes would be eliminated.
Payroll taxes would not be deductible. However, businesses could
expense all outlays on research and development and investment
in plant, equipment, structures, inventory, and land. Net operating
losses would be carried forward with interest.
<P>
Loss of the interest deduction for mortgagees and businesses would
be offset by elimination of the tax on interest received by lenders.
Interest rates would be expected to fall to current after-tax
levels, compensating borrowers for the loss of the deduction,
and leaving lenders with the same after-tax return as under current
law.
<P>
It is difficult to deal with banks, S&amp;Ls, brokerage houses,
and other financial intermediaries in any tax system in which
interest is not generally deductible by borrowers and taxable
to lenders, including the returns-exempt tax, sales taxes, or
value added taxes. A separate tax, based on inflow-outflow, would
have to be used for these businesses.(10)
<P>
Variations on this system are possible. In its pure form, the
Hall-Rabushka tax would have no itemized deductions for individuals.
One variation would allow the retention of the charitable deduction
and retention of the home mortgage interest deduction for borrowers.(11)
(Retention of the mortgage interest deduction for borrowers has
a limited revenue effect if the lenders are taxed on the interest
as under current law.) Congress should consider how best to treat
state and local income and property taxes. (See note 7, and background
paper, below, for a more complete discussion of various itemized
deductions for individuals and businesses under both tax systems.)
<P>
In its pure form, Hall-Rabushka would collect a greater amount
of tax from business than current law. To avoid the need for changes
in labor compensation agreements, retention of the payroll tax
deduction for businesses could be considered. To diminish the
adverse effect of the payroll tax on employment, the deduction
could be extended to individuals as well, in exchange for continued
but less onerous taxation of social security benefits. (The extension
is feasible under either income tax system. See background paper,
below, on the income tax treatment of payroll taxes and social
security benefits.)
<P>
<B>Comparison of saving-deferred tax and returns-exempt tax</B>

<P>
<I>Advantages and disadvantages of the saving-deferred tax.</I>
Of the two systems, the saving-deferred or inflow-outflow tax
would make taxes somewhat more visible to taxpayers, because interest,
dividends, and other returns on capital would be displayed on
individual income tax forms. It would be somewhat more complex
for individuals, but far less complex for businesses, than the
other approach. Businesses would pass through all taxable income
to individuals. Only distributions by businesses would be taxable;
businesses would have far fewer accounting and compliance costs,
and would not have to file federal tax returns. The deduction
for investment in plant and equipment would be effectively shifted
from businesses to the savers who provide the financing. This
would be an advantage for start-up businesses that have little
income as yet from previous investments against which to take
a deduction. The inflow-outflow tax could handle financial businesses
as easily as non-financial businesses.
<P>
<I>Advantages and disadvantages of the returns-exempt tax.</I>
The returns-exempt single rate tax would be simpler for individuals,
but more complex for business, than the other approach. There
would be fewer deductions to account for than under current law,
and individuals would not have to report capital income -- a simplification.
Businesses would still have to file tax returns in this system;
capital income would be reported on business tax returns, and
the tax would be less visible to the ultimate owners. To make
the tax on capital income visible to savers, businesses could
be required to report the income and the tax to lenders and shareholders,
for information only; the lenders and shareholders would not have
to include it on their tax returns. The financial sector of the
economy would have to be given the alternative inflow-outflow
type of tax treatment.
<P>
<B>Key points in common for the saving-deferred and returns-exempt
taxes</B> 
<P>
<I>Equivalence and importance of the approaches' treatment of
saving.</I> The two methods are equivalent in their treatment
of saving (if savers face the same tax rate over time), and better
than current law. For example, suppose that interest rates are
7 percent. At that rate of interest, $1 saved would grow, with
interest, to $2 in ten years. (Alternatively, suppose that reinvested
earnings caused the price of a share of stock to double in ten
years, and that the stock is sold and the capital gain is realized
at that time.) Suppose also that the income tax rate is 20%.
<P>
Under the saving-deductible method, an individual could earn $100,
save it without paying tax up front on the deposit or on the annual
interest build-up (or on the stock purchase and accruing gain),
and withdraw $200 ten years later. After paying a 20% tax on the
withdrawal (or the proceeds of the stock sale), the saver would
have $160 to spend.
<P>
Under the exempt-returns method, an individual could earn $100,
pay a 20% tax, and save the remaining $80. Without owing any further
tax on the returns, he could withdraw $160 ten years later, and,
here too, would have $160 to spend.
<P>
Either neutral method is better than current law. Under the current
tax system, an individual earning $100 would have to pay a 20%
tax, save $80, and owe tax annually on the interest, reducing
the 7% percent interest rate to an after-tax rate of 5.6%. With
less interest left to build up after taxes, the saver would accumulate
only $138 to withdraw and spend after ten years. The $22 difference
($160-$138) between current law and the neutral systems (about
14% over 10 years) is a measure of the double taxation imposed
by current law on income that is saved.
<P>
The penalty on saving under current law sharply retards the build
up of retirement saving that is not protected from double taxation
by a pension plan. (See graph.) A dollar saved at 7% interest,
tax-deferred, at age 25 would compound to $16 at age 65, and to
$32 at age 75, before tax. After a 20% tax on withdrawals, the
saver would have $12.80 or $25.60 to spend. In an ordinary double-taxed
bank account at 7%, however, the spendable amount at age 65 would
be only $8.83, or only $15.23 at age 70, about 30% and 40% less,
respectively.
<P><img src="rpt4.gif" alt="Graph" align="right">
The enhanced ability to save for education, home ownership, and
retirement would be an important feature of a restructured tax
code. Retirement saving is a subject of great importance as the
baby boom approaches old age. The Social Security System faces
enormous deficits. Eliminating those deficits by means of large
increases in the payroll tax would cost several million jobs.
The Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform has discussed
increased reliance on private retirement saving as an alternative
solution.(12)
<P>
<I>Treatment of capital gains.</I> As the example above shows,
the two methods produce the same after-tax returns on saving involving
capital gains. In fact, under either the saving-deferred or returns-exempt
approach to ending the tax bias, capital gains would cease to
be a tax issue, greatly simplifying tax forms for individual and
business taxpayers and reducing disputes with the IRS. Under the
return-exempt approach, there would obviously be no tax on capital
gains, because no returns on saving would be taxable. In the deductible-saving
case, the purchase of the assets would be expensed (resulting
in no basis for tax purposes), and all the proceeds of asset sales
would be properly included in taxable income. Any gain or loss
embedded in the numbers would be automatically calculated correctly
for tax purposes, without any special calculations required. If
the proceeds of asset sales were reinvested, any embedded gains
could be rolled over, and would remain tax deferred until withdrawn
for consumption.
<P>
<I>Growth and job creation.</I> Either of these income tax systems,
or the national sales tax, would be far more conducive to growth
than current law. They would allow the economy to gain, over about
a decade, the investment and growth that the current biased tax
system has suppressed. They take different approaches to eliminating
the biases in current law. They have different transition problems,
but none of these are unsolvable. The sooner that one of these
approaches is adopted, the sooner the gains can be realized.
<P>
The potential for faster growth of jobs and incomes should allay
concerns that tax reform might force a choice between higher short
term budget deficits and tax increases for some taxpayers. In
particular, when we look at how tax reform affects a family or
individual worker or taxpayer, it is not enough to apply the new
tax code to last year's income because neither the economy nor
the taxpayer will behave the same way after tax reform as before.
As saving and investment increase, productivity and the taxpayer's
income will grow faster for a decade or more and be higher by
increasing amounts over time. The taxpayer will enjoy lower interest
rates on mortgages and student loans as the tax burden on saving
is reduced. Although reduced taxes on saving may not instantly
lower the tax of a twenty-year-old who has not yet begun to save,
it will lower taxes on that worker as he or she accumulates assets
over a working lifetime, and leave that worker many tens of thousands,
or even hundreds of thousands, of dollars better off by age 65,
and far more secure in retirement (see graph). Whatever happens
in the first year, people will enjoy a lifetime of benefits from
a pro-grow tax reform, and it is the lifetime benefit that should
be looked at.
<P>
As for the federal budget, there are many benefits, both short
term and long term. People would immediately have less incentive
to shelter their existing income from tax. Even before total income
rises, Treasury would see some revenue offset to any net tax reduction.
Furthermore, national income would begin to grow faster right
from the start. An extra point on the growth rate would add a
cumulative extra half trillion dollars to federal revenues over
seven years. There would also be gains on the spending side of
the budget. More people working, and working at higher paying
jobs, would men a natural reduction in claims for income support
payments. These saving would mount with time.
<P>
Not all of the budget savings from faster economic growth and
lower interest rates would be available in the first few years
of the reform. But in light of the enormous potential benefits
of reform to the economy, the population, and the budget, it would
be reasonable to make a special effort to restrain the growth
of federal spending to accommodate the change in the tax system.

<U>Notes</U> 
<P>
1. A graduated rate variant of the savings exempt income tax comprises
the individual tax portion of the Nunn-Domenici USA (Unlimited
Saving Allowance) Tax proposal.
<P>
2. See Robert E. Hall and Alvin Rabushka, The Flat Tax, second
edition, Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University, Stanford,
CA, 1995. Several variations on the approach have been offered
by Representative Dick Armey and Senator Richard Shelby, Senator
Arlen Specter, and others.
<P>
3. National sales taxes have been discussed or proposed by Senator
Richard Lugar, House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, and
Representatives Bill Tauzin and Dan Schaefer, among others.
<P>
4. Value added taxes, collected by businesses at each stage of
production on the labor compensation they pay and the capital
income they receive, and manufacturers excise taxes, are the least
visible taxes of all. The Commission did not give serious consideration
to these taxes.
<P>
5. Border adjustability is often cited as an advantage of a national
sales tax (or of other so-called indirect taxes, such as a VAT).
However, most economists are skeptical that border adjustability
would benefit the U.S. economy as a whole. It would not, by itself,
increase total U.S. output and jobs. It would rearrange that output
somewhat, and shift resources accordingly, but to no apparent
purpose. We would produce more for export, and less for our own
use, and we would import more to fill in the gap. The balance
of payments would be largely unaffected, reflecting the same level
of international capital flows as before the changes. Jobs gained
in producing for export would be at the expense of jobs aimed
at production for domestic use. There would be adjustment costs
due to the change in production patterns, and potential efficiency
losses. Consumption-based taxes are not taxes on consumption.
They are taxes on the labor and capital income earned in producing
goods and services. The U.S. tax on workers and capital employed
in the United States ought not to vary depending on where their
products are sold. If Congress adopts a sales tax, consideration
should be given to choosing the origin-based variety, which is
the approach most consistent with simple territorial taxation.
<P>
6. Repayment of loans would be part of deductible net saving;
borrowing would be a taxable inflow, but only if used for consumption
and not repaid. Borrowing used to buy assets such as stocks, a
home, or a machine for one's business would not result in more
taxable income because the outlays would be deductible saving,
canceling the effect.
<P>
7. Charitable contributions would be deductible by the donor.
In theory, the recipients would take the contributions into income,
but in practice, there is no need to. Charities either distribute
their receipts to employees, researchers, students, or the poor,
etc., or save a portion, all of which are deductible activities.
The poor who receive charity would be too poor to owe tax. Current
law simply allows the charitable deduction and ignores the remaining
calculations.
<P>
8. In the pure form of this system, all payroll and state and
local taxes would be deductible. State and local taxes are outflows.
They largely fund welfare and other aid to the poor (income transfers
akin to charitable contributions to persons below taxable levels
of income) or education (a transfer that pays for the cost of
the recipient's acquisition of human capital), all of which could
be considered, in theory, to be reasonable deductions. Some state
and local services accrue to the individual taxpayer or homeowner,
however, and the amounts of these activities vary widely by states
and localities. The tax literature is divided on this deduction.
<P>
9. More generally, in a pure version of this tax, businesses would
not be taxable because their outflows would always equal their
inflows. Business inflows would include the revenues from sales
of goods and services and income on financial investments, plus
borrowing and sales of new shares to stockholders. Their outlays
would include operating costs (wages, purchases of materials,
inventory, outlays on research and development, rent and royalties
paid, etc.), taxes, dividend payments to shareholders, interest
payments to lenders, and investment in plant and equipment). Anything
left over for financial investment would be treated as tax deferred
saving on behalf of the shareholders.
<P>
10. State and local taxes are costs of doing business. If state
and local taxes are disallowed as deductions, businesses would
have to file tax forms just to pay federal tax on their state
and local taxes. This system works best, and achieves the greatest
degree of simplification, if all business expenses are deductible.
<P>
11. The version referred to is that introduced by Representative
Armey, which modified to original Hall-Rabushka system to allow
for the deductibility of pension contributions. Existing types
of pension arrangements (deductible contributions, taxable benefits)
would continue to be permitted under this bill, and may be liberalized.
<P>
12. The taxable income for financial institutions would be the
difference between interest received and paid, less wages and
other costs, as under current law. The problem arises because
many of the charges and fees of financial intermediaries are contained
in the spread between the interest rate they charge borrowers
customers and the rate they pay depositors (or, for brokerages,
the spread on securities transactions). If borrowers are not allowed
to deduct interest paid to the intermediaries, special rules would
be needed to tell the customers how much of the interest or other
charges they paid constitute the &quot;intermediation service&quot;
of the intermediary that is a deductible business expense.
<P>
13. Senator Arlen Specter (R-Pa) has introduced a version of this
tax with these two adjustments.

<h2>DEDUCTIONS AND TRADEOFFS</h2>
By Alan Reynolds</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
 Discussions of tax &quot;reform&quot; too often bypass the most
basic structural questions, such as what should be taxed and what
the tax rate should be, and jump ahead to the relatively peripheral
issue of itemized deductions for individuals.  
<P>
 The controversy is not about whether or not deductions will be
permitted in a new tax system.  All plans for a new tax system
would exempt low-income citizens in one way or another, through
standard or specific deductions, personal exemptions, exclusions,
adjustments or credits.  With the exception of cash rebates or
&quot;refundable&quot; tax credits (which are actually federal
spending programs run though the tax code), the various ways of
leaving some portion of  income untaxed have essentially the same
effect under a single tax rate.
<P>
 The issues are (1) how large should the total of such deductions
be, given the fact that having more deductions implies a higher
tax rate; and (2) what form should the deductions take.   Some
prefer a larger &quot;standard&quot; deduction and/or personal
exemption to specific  &quot;itemized&quot; deductions.  The issue
is sometimes posed as if specific deductions are to be eliminated
in order to get a lower tax rate, but that is not true if any
revenue gained from eliminating specific deductions  is devoted
to enlarging the standard deduction.  So long as the dollars involved
are the same, then either form of deduction reduces the amount
of income left to be taxed, and therefore keeps the tax rate higher
than otherwise.
<P>
 The Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated many specific deductions,
such as a deduction for state and local sales tax, for individual
health insurance premiums and for consumer  interest expense.
But this was matched by an increase in standard deductions and
personal exemptions.   The total of all deductions was 23.4% of
adjusted gross income in 1990-92, up from 23.1% in 1982-84.(1)
Only the form of deductions changed, not the amount.  
<P>
    A common concern is that unless<I> all </I>specific deductions
are eliminated, then not one can be eliminated.  The experience
of 1986 suggests that this is not necessarily true.  Several large
deductions were eliminated or severely curtailed after 1986, while
other specific deductions were not affected.
<P>
<I><B>Simplicity:  </B></I>Simplicity is not a very persuasive
argument when it comes to choosing between standard or itemized
deductions.  In recent years, the IRS has required detailed proof
of small charitable contributions, which is a minor nuisance.
 Yet the largest itemized deductions, for taxes and mortgage interest,
merely involve copying a number from one form to another and subtracting.
<P>
 The real sources of complexity for individuals include keeping
records on the buying and selling of houses, calculating the alternative
minimum tax (AMT), calculating the amount of Social Security benefits
subject to tax, calculating the phase-out of exemptions and deductions
at higher incomes, reporting investment income, determining which
interest expenses are deductible and which are not, and engaging
in estate planning.   All major plans for a new tax system would
eliminate all of these major sources of tax complexity, regardless
of whether any specific deduction was kept or not.   All new tax
plans would also eliminate the far greater complexities in defining
and reporting <I>business</I> income, including complex depreciation
schedules, AMT, and the elaborate system of taxes and credits
on income produced abroad.
<P>
  
<P>
<I><B>Fairness:  </B></I>In the past, a major fairness argument
has always been that itemized deductions or personal exemptions
were more valuable to those in higher tax brackets.  With a single
tax rate, this objection becomes irrelevant, because deductions
are equally valuable to all taxpayers.
<P>
 People in similar circumstances should bear similar burdens.
 On this basis, it might be argued that some itemized deductions
or exemptions are fair, because they measure income that people
no longer have at their disposal (such as alimony payments or
charitable contributions), or because they adjust for the fact
that families with many children actually have a higher poverty
threshold than smaller families with the same income.
<P>
<I><B>Neutrality:  </B></I>Another argument for getting rid of
certain deductions and exclusions might be that they violate &quot;neutrality,&quot;
distorting the allocation of resources in ways that might harm
the economy. Distortions have not often been mentioned in the
context of the few remaining  itemized deductions for individuals.
 Nobody complains, for example, that the deduction for charitable
contributions causes too much generosity.
<P>
 Some have  argued that the mortgage interest deduction unduly
favors investment in housing.  &quot;It is interesting,&quot;
writes Robert Hall, &quot;that although the personal tax treatment
of interest on borrowing against securities is identical to that
for houses, nobody has characterized the deduction of interest
on securities as a 'subsidy' to securities.&quot;(2)
<P>
 To the extent that the existing tax system has favored  housing
investment, it is largely because corporate investment is subject
to so many layers of taxation. The fact that capital gains on
houses can be rolled over into the same type of  investments is
not favoritism, except in comparison with the way other gains
are now taxed.   It is true that the shelter the home provides
(measured by the &quot;imputed rent&quot; that GNP accountants
assume homeowners &quot;pay&quot; themselves) is not taxed at
the federal level, but it is taxed by the property tax.
<P>
 Before the 1986 tax law, the individual deduction for sales tax
was a source of complexity, involving adding-up a lot of receipts
or using a rather arbitrary table that based estimated sales on
income.  To some degree this may mean that residents of states
with no income tax pay higher federal taxes so that residents
of states with high income taxes can claim a deduction.  People
with the same income are also treated differently depending on
where they live.  The fact that only income (and property) taxes
are now deductible for individuals may induce states and cities
to rely more heavily on the income tax, and less on the savings-neutral
sales tax.  
<P>
<I><B>Visibility:  </B></I>For businesses, state and local taxes
are costs of  producing  income, and therefore are deductible
expenses.  In many communities, the property tax is used to finance
services (such as trash collection) that are financed by deductible
fees to private providers in other communities. Sales taxes on
business materials and equipment are deductible, since they are
part of other deductible costs of doing business.  For individuals,
state and local taxes are not costs of producing income, but to
some degree, are the price of consumed public services.  That
price should be visible.  Deductibility of certain state and local
taxes may reduce the visibility of those taxes.  However, some
of the revenue raised by state and local taxation supports education
and income transfers to the poor, which are tax-deductible transfers
when achieved through private charities, and which represent the
transfer of income from the taxpayer to the ultimate recipient
of the income.  This is a gray area requiring further study.
<P>
<I><B>Symmetry:  </B></I>The amount of revenue lost through deductions
often depends on whether or not the operating principle of <I>symmetry
</I>is maintained.  With perfect symmetry, any deductible expense
to one taxpayer would normally be taxable income to the person
or company that receives that money.  With a single tax rate,
the net effect on revenue is roughly zero.
<P>
 The mortgage interest deduction, for example, need not involve
any significant revenue loss so long as symmetry is maintained
-- that is, so long as lenders are required to pay taxes on the
interest income they receive.(3) One could retain current law
practice -- allowing homeowners to deduct their mortgage interest
and requiring the lenders to pay tax on it -- with little or no
adverse effect on the tax rate.  Not deducting the interest and
not taxing it is somewhat simpler than deducting the interest
and taxing it, but it yields very similar after-tax results for
both borrowers and lenders.  Under current law, mortgage lenders
charge a rate that includes the tax they must pay on the interest,
but borrowers save a corresponding portion of the interest rate
because the interest they pay is tax deductible.  Under the alternative
treatment, the lender would charge a lower tax-free rate about
equal to the after-tax rate borrowers face now.
<P>
 Exclusions in current law violate several principles.  Non-pension
fringe benefits are labor costs that are deductible by the employer
but are excluded from the taxable income of the employee (a violation
of symmetry).  Health care and cafeteria plans are the biggest
examples.  Excluding fringe benefits from taxable income makes
them relatively more attractive than cash wages, leading people
to buy more of the favored services and products than they otherwise
would (violating neutrality and distorting output).  The exclusion
has led most working Americans to obtain health insurance for
themselves and their families through employer-provided health
plans. These plans hide a portion of workers' compensation, limit
people's control over their health plans, and result in third
party payment systems that hide costs and lead people to treat
health care as a (nearly) free good (violating visibility).  The
consequence is over-use of the health care system that drives
up insurance costs for families and businesses and increases federal
and state government outlays for health care for the poor and
the elderly.
<P>
  Each deduction, exclusion, adjustment and tax credit needs to
be held up against the principles of sound taxation and judged
on its merits. The choice between standard and specific deductions
is less important than the overall size of all types of deductions.
 If the public prefers that a large amount of revenue be devoted
to deductions or exclusions, regardless of what form those deductions
or exclusions take, then the tax rate must be higher than otherwise,
or federal spending must be reduced.

<h2>INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF PAYROLL TAXES AND SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS</h2> 
By Stephen Entin</center><P>
<blockquote>
The deduction, as allowed in current law, of the employer's half
of the payroll tax as a business expense should be retained. Consideration
should be given to allowing individuals to deduct their half of
the payroll tax from taxable income as well. The increases in
the 1993 budget agreement in the amount of social security benefits
subject to income tax should be rolled back, and the method of
taxing benefits in the future should be reformed. The social security
earnings test should be eased or eliminated.
<P>
Retention of the employer's deduction would ease the transition
to a new tax system by avoiding the need to alter existing labor
contracts and compensation, and would avoid imposing a tax on
a tax. A similar deduction for the employee's half would lower
the burden of the tax on employment and labor income.
<P>
<I>Deduction of payroll taxes and amount of benefits taxed.</I>
Under current law, the 15.3% payroll tax that supports the social
security system is nominally levied half on employers and half
on employees.(2) Employers may deduct their half of the payroll
tax as a business expense (labor cost) in computing their taxable
income under the income tax. Individuals are not allowed an itemized
deduction of their half of the tax. The self-employed may deduct
half of their payroll tax payments, corresponding to the employer's
deduction. Since 1983, individuals and married taxpayers above
certain incomes have had to pay tax on up to 50% of their social
security retirement and disability benefits (corresponding to
the half of the payroll tax contributions that had been deducted
by employers). In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993
(OBRA93), that percentage was increased to as much as 85% for
upper middle income taxpayers.
<P>
It would make sense to treat the retirement and disability portion
of the payroll taxes and social security benefits as if they were
pension arrangements. Contributions should be deductible, and,
ultimately, an appropriate portion of the retirement and disability
benefits received should be taxable. Medicare taxes and benefits
could be treated like private health insurance.
<P>
Current recipients of social security benefits should not have
to pay tax on more than half of current benefits, because only
half of the payroll taxes (the employer's share) collected on
their earnings during their working years were deductible. Consequently,
the percent of benefits subject to tax should be reduced immediately
from 85% to 50%. If individuals are allowed to deduct the individual
portion of the payroll tax in the future, then increasing amounts
of retirement and disability benefits should eventually be subjected
to tax. Because people now in the work force will not have been
allowed such a deduction for a portion of their working lives,
the amount of benefits potentially subject to tax should rise
<I>very</I> slowly, increasing slightly for each new group of
people reaching retirement age, and taking 40 years (a working
lifetime) to reach 100%.
<P>
Under current law and demographics, an increasing number of future
retirees will receive less in benefits than they have paid in
payroll taxes (in present value), and would be better off deducting
the tax than escaping tax on the benefits.(3) Note, too, that
current law is already increasing the taxation of benefits over
time, even for current retirees (and without an additional deduction),
because the income thresholds people have to reach before benefits
are taxed are not indexed for inflation.
<P>
The Hall-Rabushka Flat Tax and its variations take the opposite
approach to neutral treatment of the social security system. They
eliminate the employer deduction for payroll taxes, and, correspondingly,
eliminate all taxes on benefits. This is a theoretically equivalent
approach over a working lifetime; the share of benefits taxed
equals the share of payroll taxes deducted. However, the transition
to that system would require altering current wage and salary
agreements affecting all workers and businesses, and would provide
a windfall to current beneficiaries on benefits corresponding
to previously deducted taxes.
<P>
Going further in the other direction to allow both employers and
employees a credit for payroll taxes would go well beyond normal
treatment of pensions or saving. Folding the payroll tax into
the income tax rate structure in this manner would require higher
tax rates on wages, salaries, and the returns on private saving.
There are other ways to deal with the problems posed by payroll
taxes without raising the income tax rate structure to that degree.
If further relief from the payroll tax is required, it would be
preferable to allow individuals to redirect a portion of it into
their own private retirement arrangements.
<P>
<I>Reforming how benefits are taxed.</I> Whatever percent of benefits
is deemed taxable in the future, the current method of taxing
the benefits must be scrapped. It is totally inconsistent with
a single tax rate system, and is an outrage even under a graduated
rate system. The current tax on benefits is really a tax on other
retirement income - interest, dividends, pensions, annuities,
and wages - at super-normal tax rates, as that other income exceeds
certain thresholds. These super-normal tax rates are an extreme
penalty on private saving and strongly urge young workers to avoid
saving for retirement.
<P>
Retirees subject to the taxation of benefits must add $0.50 in
social security benefits to taxable income for each dollar that
their income exceeds $25,000 for single filers and $32,000 for
couples, until half of benefits are taxed. They must add $0.85
to taxable income for each dollar of income over $34,000 for single
filers and $44,000 for couples until 85% of benefits are taxed.
Earning an extra dollar of interest, dividend, pension, or annuity
income can add $1.50 or $1.85 to taxable income, effectively increasing
marginal tax rates to 1.5 or 1.85 times normal levels. For someone
in the 28 percent tax bracket, there is a marginal tax rate of
42 percent or 52 percent on an additional dollar of interest.
On wages subject to the payroll tax, marginal tax rates can reach
56 percent to 65 percent. Rates can range from 85 percent to 115
percent on wages when the worker is also subject to the social
security earnings test. (See below.) The income thresholds are
not adjusted for inflation. By the time the baby boom finishes
retiring, nearly all beneficiaries will be paying tax on some
portion of their benefits.
<P>
The 50 percent and 85 percent phase-ins of benefits into taxable
income should be eliminated to remove the spikes in the marginal
tax rates. Whatever part of benefits should be taxable should
simply be added to other taxable income. This should impose no
hardship on those not paying tax on benefits under current law
(a diminishing number over time as inflation erodes the thresholds)
if personal and family exempt amounts under the income tax are
raised to more generous levels under tax restructuring. If higher
exempt amounts and reduced taxation of savings income under tax
restructuring are not deemed sufficient to shelter lower income
elderly taxpayers from taxation of benefits, either of two alternative
allowances could be adopted. An additional exempt amount could
be allowed for the elderly. Alternatively, some dollar amount
of social security benefits, for example, $2,000 for a single
retiree, $3,000 for a couple receiving the 50 percent spousal
benefit, and up to $4,000 for a two-worker couple, could be made
tax exempt. Benefits above the exempt amounts would simply be
added to taxable income, up to the maximum taxable fraction in
force for each age group.
<P>
<I>Easing the social security earnings test.</I> Substantial increases
in the social security earnings test, or its complete elimination,
are essential to encourage continued contributions by the most
experienced part of the labor force. Easing the earnings test
would remove an enormous barrier to productive participation by
persons age 62 through 69 in the labor force. It would enable
them to raise their incomes, and would raise income and payroll
tax receipts by more than it would increase government outlays.
Everyone would gain.
<P>
The earnings test reduces social security benefits by one third
(for recipients ages 65-69) or one-half (for recipients ages 62-64)
of wage and salary income in excess of very modest exempt amounts.
These cuts are equivalent to 33-1/3% and 50% tax rates on the
affected income, on top of income and payroll tax rates. At incomes
of only $15,000 to $25,000, combined marginal tax rates on wages
can reach 65 percent to 85 percent. At incomes of $25,000 to $60,000,
taxation of benefits and the earnings test can generate marginal
tax rates of 85 percent to 115 percent, blatantly confiscatory.

<P>
1. Of the total, 12.4% supports social security retirement and
disability benefits, and 2.9% supports Medicare Part A hospital
insurance benefits.
<P>
2. An alternative, more complicated approach to taxing benefits
is to exclude an amount equal to the taxes individuals paid into
the system, and tax the excess. This would be done on an &quot;annuitzed
basis&quot; -- a portion of each year's benefits, based on one's
earnings history and life expectancy, would be attributed to tax
payments, and the remainder would be taxable. For people who retired
many years ago, and who will get back far more in benefits than
they paid in taxes, the taxable share of benefits would be quite
high. Future recipients will get back far less, relative to their
tax payments, and would have a much smaller share of benefits
subject to tax. The percentage would vary by individual, by marital
status, and by generation.

<h2>SIMPLIFY INTERNATIONAL TAXATION</h2>
By Stephen Entin</center><P>
<blockquote> Taxation of personal and business income earned abroad is a very
complicated feature of the current income tax code.  Congress
should consider a territorial tax system to replace the global
system in current law.  That is, the U.S. tax should be imposed
on all income generated within the borders of the United States,
whether by U.S. residents or foreigners.  Conversely, income earned
outside the United States by U.S. businesses and individuals should
be not be subject to U.S. taxes.(1)
<P>
 Unlike most nations, the United State taxes the repatriated global
income of its businesses that operate subsidiaries or partnerships
abroad, after allowance of a tax credit for foreign income taxes
paid.  U.S. firms with operations in foreign countries owe tax
on their repatriated earnings if the tax rate in the foreign country
is less than that in the United States.  U.S. individuals also
owe U.S. tax on their interest or dividend income from foreign
investments after a similar tax credit.  Wages and salaries earned
abroad by Americans are subject to similar treatment on amounts
above $70,000.  Conversely, the costs of some activities carried
out in the United States are treated, for tax purposes, as if
they were foreign, as with the complicated allocation rules regarding
the cost of research and development.
<P>
 The foreign tax provisions are among the most complex features
of the U.S. tax code.  They impose immense costs of compliance
to U.S. taxpayers and very high enforcement costs to the IRS for
only a small gain to the Treasury.  The U.S. tax code would be
simpler, and the income of U.S. residents would be greater, if
the United States were to adopt territorial taxation.
<P>
 The attempt to tax foreign earnings of U.S. businesses raises
relatively little revenue.  It merely discourages repatriation
of business income earned abroad to the United States for reinvestment
or distribution to shareholders or other owners.  Firms do not
repatriate their foreign earnings unless they have sufficient
foreign tax credits to avoid the extra tax. Nonetheless, the damage
done by the current system to particular U.S. businesses is substantial,
in terms of high compliance costs and lost competitiveness.
<P>
 The foreign tax provisions of the internal revenue code put U.S.
businesses and individuals at a considerable competitive disadvantage
in global markets, and generally reduce total world-wide investment
by, and income of, U.S. residents.  Other nations have income
tax systems that are primarily territorial.  They do not impose
taxes on the foreign earnings of their resident businesses or
individuals.  Consequently, U.S. firms operating in a foreign
country with corporate tax rates that are lower than in the U.S.
are at a competitive disadvantage compared with firms from most
European or Asian countries, because only the U.S. firms would
owe a second layer of tax to the country in which its parent company
is based.  Similarly, American workers abroad in low tax countries,
and the companies that employ them, are at a disadvantage relative
to foreign workers and firms in such locations.
<P>
 The global tax system of the United States discourages U.S. firms
from engaging in production or other activities abroad, or pressures
U.S. businesses to structure foreign business operations in particular
forms purely for tax reasons.   This should not be a goal of tax
policy.  Imposing higher taxes on foreign operations of U.S. businesses
does not improve the U.S. investment climate, and does not add
to domestic investment.  Insofar as it discourages investment
abroad, however, it costs domestic U.S. operations billions of
dollars in sales to potential foreign subsidiaries and partnerships
that were never formed.   Under some circumstances, the opposite
problem arises; other U.S. tax provisions sometimes force foreign
subsidiaries to invest in foreign projects at the expense of U.S.
projects to avoid additional U.S. taxes, clearly a perverse result.
<P>
 In recent years, the United States has imported capital because
investment has far exceeded domestic saving.  The new tax system
will undoubtedly encourage domestic saving, but it will probably
attract foreign capital too by making the United States a particularly
attractive place in which to invest.  A capital importing country
may raise more revenue from a simple territorial tax system than
from a system based on the residence of the investor.
<P>
 Whatever new tax system is chosen, there must be a clearer, simpler,
and more certain determination of what income is foreign or domestic,
or what international transaction is taxable, than under current
law.  The current confusion over transfer pricing must be eliminated.
 In addition, attention must be given to the proper tax treatment
of foreign source license fees and royalties so as not to discourage
research and development in the United States.

 <b>Note</b>
<P>
1.  These results would occur naturally under an origin-based
sales tax or VAT and a returns-exempt income tax, and could be
designed into a saving-deferred income tax.  The sales tax, VAT,
and returns-exempt income tax would be collected at the business
level before dividends and interest were paid to lenders and shareholders,
including foreigners.  Under the saving-deferred tax, in which
businesses pass income on to lenders and shareholders for taxation,
business payments to foreigners could be made subject to withholding,
much like current law, so that they need not file tax returns.
 Interest payments to foreigners on federal government bonds do
not represent returns on business investment or economic activity,
and, as under current law, would not be subject to withholding.
 Destination-based sales taxes and VATs that rebate the tax at
the border are not territorial.

<blockquote>
<hr>

<P>
The National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax
Reform is holding a series of public hearings to investigate problems
with the current income tax system and principles of tax reform.
<P>
Senate Leader Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich
have charged our 14-member commission with making recommendations
for a tax code that is &quot;flatter, fairer, and simpler&quot;
-- a system that will encourage economic growth and greater opportunity
for all Americans.
<P>
Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich asked commissioners
to study ways in which the current tax code -- with its &quot;high
marginal tax rates and thousands of pages of rules, regulations,
and red tape -- poses a barrier to economic growth.&quot; As they
said:
<UL>
<LI>It punishes the most dynamic forces for growth
in our economy -- the small business owners and entrepreneurs
who turn bold ideas into new businesses, new jobs, and new products.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>It discourages working Americans who are trying
to save for the future and to build a better life for themselves
and their families.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>It is endlessly complex and confusing, costing
literally billions of dollars in lost time and effort.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
One of the most important aspects of our work is
to talk with Americans from all walks of life -- small business
people, farmers, factory workers, inventors, and entrepreneurs
-- who make America work. We will be holding hearings across the
country over the next several months to talk with taxpayers and
to hear from experts who study tax policy.
<P>
We believe that tax reform must move toward making
the tax code more family friendly and create incentives for savings
and investment.  We want to help guide the debate toward changes
that will reinvigorate entrepreneurship, risk taking, savings,
investment, and work effort.  And we hope to contribute to changes
that will make America more competitive and expand the nation's
worldwide leadership in the 21st century economy. 
<P>
We know far too much about what doesn't work, and
we know that those who are hurt the most by bad public policies,
especially tax policy, are those at the bottom of the economic
ladder. 
<P>
While there is overwhelming anger and frustration
with the current system, we need to explore more about citizens'
experiences with problems and solutions before we can go forward
with radical change.
<P>
For example, what are the implications to the economy
of a steeply progressive tax system? What is the impact on economic
growth of higher marginal tax rates? What do people mean whey
they say they want a &quot;fairer&quot; tax system?  What do we
mean by &quot;flatter&quot; tax rates?  There are a lot of different
views, and we want to know what the American people think and
what are the ramifications.
<P>
I am proud to serve with the distinguished men and
women on this commission who have offered to give of their time
and energy and talents so that all Americans can have a better
chance at the American dream. Individually and collectively, my
colleagues on the commission have a huge font of knowledge, experience,
and courage that can help guide our work.
<P>
We are setting the stage for a 21st century tax policy
for America.  It is imperative that everyone work together to
advance this monumental task.  
<P>
What we are undertaking may feel at times like moving
a mountain. Making the tax code simpler will be a very complicated
process.
<P>
We hope that this series of hearings -- in which
both citizens and experts present views -- will help all of us
to learn more and to make better informed decisions about the
hard choices that lie ahead. If we can find the core, central
principles of a new vision for tax reform that includes everyone's
views, we can get this done. The American people -- and our children
and grandchildren-- will be the winners.

DOLE & GINGRICH FORM NATIONAL COMMISSION ON ECONOMIC GROWTH
& TAX REFORM: JACK KEMP TO SERVE AS CHAIRMAN OF NINE MEMBER PANEL
"TO DESIGN A SYSTEM THAT IS FLATTER, FAIRER, & SIMPLER"</center>
<p>
Today, Speaker Gingrich and I are pleased to announce the formation of the National Commission on
Economic Growth and Tax Reform. We're especially pleased to announce that Jack Kemp has agreed to lead this commission by serving as chairman.
<p>
As you all know, Jack is one of our country's most passionate voices on behalf of economic growth and
expanded opportunity for all Americans. For more than two decades, from his service in Congress to his
leadership of Empower America, Jack has been one of our party's most innovative thinkers on economic policy. No one within the GOP can speak to these issues more creatively and more credibly than Jack Kemp.
<p>
Our current federal tax code -- with its high marginal rates and thousands of pages of rules, regulations and red tape -- poses a formidable barrier to economic growth.
<p>
It punishes the most dynamic forces for growth in our economy -- the small business owners and
entrepreneurs who turn bold ideas into new businesses, new jobs, and new products.
<p>
It discourages working Americans who are trying to save for the future in order to build a better life for
themselves and their families.
<p>
It is endlessly complex and confusing, costing literally billions of dollars in lost time and effort.
<p>
Speaker Gingrich is moving important tax legislation through the House right now -- a vital step toward
making the tax code more family-friendly and creating some incentives for saving and investment.
<p>
But the purpose of this commission is to move beyond tax reform toward a complete overhaul of the
entire tax system. That's why we have asked Jack to reexamine the entire 9,000 page federal tax code: to start with a blank piece of paper and design a system that is flatter, fairer, and simpler -- one that will
encourage strong economic growth and greater opportunity for all our people.
<p>
The commission will consist of eight members, plus the chairman. Four will be appointed by me and four
by the Speaker. It will issue a report by late September.
<p>
I look forward to working with Jack and Newt and receiving the commission's recommendations.

<b><a name="Chairman Kemp">CHAIRMAN KEMP</a></b>: (In progress) -- is an old friend of Carroll Campbell's and mine and several members, Ed Feulner.
<p> 
And on April 3rd of this year, Bob Dole, Speaker Gingrich -- Majority Leader Bob Dole --announced a commission, the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform.  It's a view that you share.  It's a view that Americans share on both sides of the aisle.  
<p> 
 We're going to hear today not only from:  Bill Archer, Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee; 
But Dick Gephardt, the Minority Leader;  The Majority Leader of the House, Dick Armey; Senators Nunn and Domenici, who are very active, as you've been, Mr. Chairman, in Senate tax reform. And then Senator Packwood, Chairman of the Finance Committee; And Connie Mack, Chairman of the Joint Economic 
Committee. 

On that April 3rd, Senator Dole charged us with 
reforming -- or coming up with a reform that leads to a flatter, 
fairer, simpler, lower tax rate system that creates opportunity 
for all Americans and leads, of course, to economic growth.<p> 
 
		On May 24th, he, along with Speaker Gingrich, announced 
the Commissioners.
 
		Bill, you know all of us.  But I'd like for you to meet 
more formally: 
 
			Shirley Peterson, former Commissioner of the IRS 
under Ronald Reagan.   
 
			Carroll Campbell, you need no introduction to, but 
Governor Campbell is president and chief executive officer of the 
American Council of Life Insurance.
 
			Ken Blackwell, an old friend of yours.  He was 
deputy at HUD under me and State treasurer of the state of Ohio.
 
			And Dean Kleckner, American Farm Bureau president.<p> 
 
			On my right, your left,<p>
 
Mr. Chairman, is Ed Feulner, president of Heritage Foundation.<p> 
 
			On his right, Herman Cain, chief executive officer 
of Godfather's Pizza.
 
			Matt Fong, state treasurer of the state of 
California.
 
			Jack Faris of the National Federation of 
Independent Business, our Nation's leading advocate for small and 
independent and entrepreneurial business. 
 
			And John Wieland, the president of John Wieland 
Homes, homebuilder from Atlanta.<p>
		Men and women who share your concern, Mr. Chairman, 
about the Tax Code and what it's doing to the American economy, 
its competitiveness, our ability to create more jobs, all the 
things that Bill Archer is well known for in his many years of 
service.
 
		We're just a citizens' commission.  These are not 
hearings, per se.   
 
		We would like you to tell us, 
 
Mr. Chairman, what are some of the issues and problems with the 
Tax Code and the tax system that has led to your involvement in 
this massive effort to dramatically change the Tax Code for the 
American people?<p> 
 
		We'd like to hear 10, 15 minutes off the top of your 
head, and from the heart, what you think those problems arem, 
allow us to dialogue with you. and have a chance to visit on this 
issue.  <p> 
 
		And then Senators Nunn and Domenici will be here in 
about 40 minutes or so.
		I would just conclude my opening comment by saying I 
got involved in tax reform by reading a speech by John F. Kennedy 
in 1962, in which he said that:  "It's a paradoxical truth that 
high tax rates lead to low tax revenues."  		
 
		And the best way to get more revenue was to get the 
economy growing again and remove this obstacle to the American 
people working and saving and investing in the American economy.<p> 
I had always been intrigued by that, because that led 
to the Reagan tax cut of '81, what you and I supported, the 
reduction in rates.  And, Bill, I just want to say it's a personal pleasure, 
as well as an official pleasure, fur me to welcome the colleague 
with whom I came to the Congress in 1970, and an old and dear 
friend, the Honorable chairman of this prestigious and august 
committee, the Honorable Bill Archer of Houston, Texas.  Thanks, Bill.

<center><b>REMARKS OF CONGRESSMAN <a name="Bill Archer">BILL ARCHER</a></b></center><br>
 <center><b>CHAIRMAN, WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE</b></center><br>
<center><b>U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</b></center><br> 
 <p>
<p>
<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Thank you, 
 <p>
Mr. Chairman.  And my gratitude to each of you.  You are all busy 
people, successful people.  And you're taking time out of your 
lives to do something that I think could be one of the most 
important things that we will do for the future of this country.<p> 
               Your recommendations when you conclude your 
deliberations will become extremely important as a lever-pull on 
what happens in the Congress of the United States relative to 
taxes.
 <p>
It is appropriate, I think, Jack, that these hearings 
be conducted in this room, because it was completed in the '30s 
and has been the situs for all of the roller-coaster changes in 
the income tax subsequent to that time for approaching 60 years 
now.<p> 
 And over and over again, well-meaning, thoughtful 
people have met in this room, determined that they could fix the 
income tax, that they could reform it, make it less obtrusive, 
make it more productive, make it simpler, make it fairer, make it 
accommodate growth.<p> 
 	I sat up there at the tier above you in 1986, and I can 
remember the proposal then that came to us -- and I think, 
Carroll, I believe you were here at that time -- from Ronald 
Reagan, delivered by his Secretary of the Treasury, my old friend 
Jimmy Baker.<p> 
 	And he sat at this spot with what was going to be the 
ultimate in a proposal for tax reform.  	
 <p>
And on the fly sheet of that 500-page summary was noted 
the title, "Fairness, Growth, and Simplicity."  <p> 
 	And the end result of that deliberation of the 
"ultimate in reform" was the most complicated tax system in the 
history of this country and perhaps the most complicated in the 
world.<p> 
 	I am convinced that it no longer serves the best 
interests of working, tax-paying Americans.  <p> 
 	And I believe the time has come for us to think very 
boldly as we look for an agenda for the next century that will 
increase savings, increase productivity, and permit America to 
reach its rightful place in a global marketplace, to become the 
economic juggernaut of the world.<p> 
 	That is my dream for this country.  And I believe the 
way that we collect taxes can have a major impact on that.<p> 
 	The current system is defended by no one.  <p> 
 	In the three days of hearings that this committee had a 
week before last, not one single voice was raised in support of 
the current income tax system, neither from the witness chairs 
nor from any person that sat on the committee, Democrat or 
Republican.<p> 
 	I challenged the administration, because they said, in 
answer to a question that I put to the Assistant Secretary for 
Tax Policy -- "If you were start a system today from scratch that 
would serve the best interests of this country, recognizing that 
we must raise money to pay the government's bills, so we must 
collect taxes in one form or another.  If you were to start today 
from scratch in a brand new country, would you put in place the 
current income tax system?"<p> 
 And the answer was a resounding no.<p> 
 My next question was:  "Will you have a proposal for us 
to replace the current income tax?"  And I did not receive a 
definitive answer.<p> 
 I hope that the message has gotten back to the White 
House, because I hope that they would be able to have a witness 
to come and tell you what they propose to change this tax system.<p> 
 Clearly, any system that requires a minimum of $300 
billion a year in compliance costs is broken, very badly broken.  
And in my opinion, I don't believe it can be fixed.  <p> 
 As probably each of you knows, I am the first chairman 
who continues to do his income tax return.  <p> 
 And I have always said, a little bit tongue in cheek, 
that if we could pass a law requiring every Member of Congress to 
do their own income tax, we would probably have a much better Tax 
Code.<p> 
 But I have made the statement that I will either fix it 
or I will suffer through it personally to try to understand 
exactly the burden that is being placed on each American 
taxpayer.  It's a very interesting exercise, very time-consuming, 
as each of you knows.<p> 
 But $300 billion minimum in compliance  costs, because 
<i>Fortune</i> magazine says it's <p> 
 $592 billion a year in compliance costs if you consider every 
possible factor.  <p> 
 I'll settle for $300 billion, to make my argument -- 
I've been termed a conservative, so I'll use the conservative 
number -- is employing some of the best minds, some of the 
greatest creativity in this country in nonproductivity.  <p> 
 Just think  with me, for a moment, if those minds were 
out creating wealth instead of trying to figure a way to make an 
end run around this complicated, very vague tax system that we 
have, how much better off all of us would be in this country.<p> 
 I think that we can go to great lengths to see that 
happen.<p> 
 In addition, we have found -- and I'm sorry to say, to 
a great extent, during years where my preferred individual was in 
the White House -- the concept that we cannot raise taxes, but we 
must find a way to get more revenue -- and Shirley Peterson knows 
very well about this -- by the collection process under the 
current tax system.  And that way nobody pays any more taxes.  <p> 
 Just give the IRS more power, more penalties, and they 
will raise more money, and we're not increasing anybody's taxes.  <p> 
 That year-after-year approach that began in the '80s 
and continues to this very day, where the Congress appropriates 
money to the IRS and says, "This is for compliance, you must 
produce more," puts tremendous pressure on the IRS to become more 
intrusive into our lives.<p> 
 And the American people now finally ring out with a 
giant chorus of support when I say I want to get the IRS 
completely and totally out of your individual lives.  <p> 
 And I would hope that that would be one of the goals 
that you would attempt to reach when you make your final 
recommendation as to the way you think taxes should be collected 
in this country.<p> 
 I personally do not believe that we can simply reform 
or simplify the Income Tax Code.  I think we must tear the income 
tax out by its roots so that it can never grow back again.<p> 
 That is another goal.  And if we do so, we will get the 
IRS completely and totally out of the lives of every individual 
in this country, so that they have to keep no records whatsoever, 
can never be audited, and can never be brought before the IRS to 
prove their innocence.<p> 
 That is a giant step, in my opinion, to reach the goal 
of greater privacy, greater freedom for individual Americans.<p> 
 As we do that, if we do it, we will also reduce the 
cost of compliance dramatically.  There are 130 million tax 
returns roughly that are submitted every year today.  We can cut 
those down. if we get the IRS out of the individual lives of 
people, to a few million. Businesses always have to keep 
records, and businesses should be the location point for the 
collection of taxes, because taxes have to come from somewhere. <p> 
I think whatever system that you recommend should also 
be perceived as fair.  But fairness often is like "beauty in the 
eye of the beholder" and is subject to different interpretations 
and different views by different people.<p> 
  believe that it is fair to a great degree if it 
creates, as you said, Mr. Chairman, economic opportunity for 
workers to realize their dream, which is more family -- real 
family income in their paychecks.  <p> 
 And we just saw the report this week that real wages 
have declined to the biggest percentage in quite a long period of 
time.  <p> 
 Real wages will increase, as we all know -- and Jack 
and I have espoused this for the 25 years that we've known each 
other -- by increasing productivity and thereby having more 
wealth, more real value to spread around amongst working 
Americans.<p> 
 Productivity, I believe, in simple economic terms, is 
the result of materials plus labor, multiplied by tools.  The 
multiplying factor is tools.  <p> 
 Now, admittedly, mental capability to use the tools -- 
and education becomes a part of the process, too. <p> 
 But if we do not have capital savings, we will not have 
updated tools.  <p> 
 If we do not have capital savings, we won't have 
investment to update tools.  And we will therefore not be able to 
upgrade productivity, and we will merely be fighting each other 
to see who has the greatest leverage to get a bigger piece of the 
pie.<p> 
 So, whatever Tax Code we have in place should be the 
greatest possible incentive for savings.<p> 
Thirdly, whatever you recommend, in my opinion, to be 
considered fair by the American people. should have the greatest 
opportunity to get at the underground economy.  <p> 
 The GAO testified right from this chair a couple of 
weeks ago that we are losing <p> 
$120 billion a year in unpaid income taxes -- and Shirley 
Peterson is well aware of this, having been commissioner of the 
IRS -- just from legal operations, not including illegal 
operations.<p> 
 And I believe we can build a better system so that 
Americans who do pay their taxes will not be off-loaded with 15 
percent higher taxes as a result of other Americans not paying 
their fair share.<p> 
And then finally -- although probably not totally 
finally, but for major points -- we need, in my opinion, a tax 
system that will help us win the battle in the global commercial 
marketplace.<p> 
 I have a friend -- and, Jack, you and I both have 
probably had many friends who would identify with this.  <p> 
 I have a friend that says "I'm a very fair individual.  
All I ever want is a fair advantage."<p> 
And what I want for the United States of America is a 
fair advantage, a tax that can be removed from the price of our 
products when they are exported so that the cost of government -- 
which, Jack Faris, you know, as a small businessperson or person 
representing small business -- and, Herman, you know, also, from 
your business operations -- a tax that must be passed on, as a 
cost of doing business, in the price of your product.  <p> 
 The income tax can never be removed from the price of 
the product.  It remains a cost and must be borne when we export 
those products.<p> 
We need a tax that can be removed and charged to 
incoming foreign products so that they bear a fair share of our 
cost of government.  <p> 
All GATT or WTL are legal, so that we do not 
precipitate a trade war, which we're now a little apprehensive 
about at this moment for what's happening in Geneva.<p> 
 These would be the goals that I would hope you would 
try to obtain in your deliberations.  They are the goals I set 
for myself.  <p> 
 I have come to the conclusion that the only way we can 
reach these goals is to transfer taxes from income to taxing 
goods and services, to get completely out of the income arena.<p> 
 Perhaps you will find a way to do it without getting 
out of the income arena.<p> 
 I do not have a specific proposal to make to you today, 
other than I am determined, in my tenure as chairman of the Ways 
and Means Committee, to make every possible effort to reach the 
goals that I just mentioned, because I believe we can win the 
battle in the international marketplace.  <p> 
 I believe we have every reason to hope and pray that we 
will not settle our differences on military battlefields in the 
next century.  But we must win the battle in the international 
marketplace, commercially.  And we need every fair advantage that 
we can get in that battle. 				<p> 
 So, I thank you for listening.  This is not a 10-second 
sound bite operation.  This is a massive undertaking.  <p> 
 It's an undertaking that each of you can play a major 
role in.  And I welcome your advice and your counsel.  <p> 
 And again, I thank you very, very much for taking the 
time out of your personal lives to take on what I think is 
perhaps one of the most important roles in what is a truly 
watershed period in this country's history.<p> 
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.<p> 
 <b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Bill, thank you.  <p> 
 That was -- the American people owe you a debt of 
gratitude.  To have a chairman of the Ways and Means Committee 
with the devotion that you reflect every day of your political 
career, and particularly in this area, is just an awesome 
thought, to think that our chairman of Ways and Means is 
committed to this type of approach that, in effect, would just 
take the whole Code out, establish a tabula rasa, a clean slate, 
and start over, and act like we are at the Constitutional 
Convention in 1787, and level the playing field, and do the type 
of things that you have alluded to.<p> 
 Since you mentioned the IRS so many times, I think it's 
appropriate that we start with the former Commissioner, Shirley 
Peterson, Shirley.<p> 
 <b>COMMISSIONER PETERSON</b>:  Mr. Chairman, thank you very 
much for agreeing to be here today.  <p> 
 
		As a member of this Commission, I thank you for 
agreeing to participate in this dialogue.  As a citizen of this 
great country, I thank you for the leadership that you are 
showing in this effort to restructure the tax system.<p> 
 
		As you may know, I have been long a proponent of 
repealing the Internal Revenue Code and starting over.  <p> 
 
		And I was struck by a couple of points that you made, 
particularly the points about burden and compliance.  <p> 
 
		It's my own view that the difficulties that we face in 
the tax system, both in its administration and in encouraging 
people to apply and in administering and enforcing the law, 
derived primarily from the complexity of the law.  <p> 
 
		And I would welcome any comments that you have to guide 
this Commission as we go forward with our considerations about 
simplifying the law.  I assume that that's one of your principal 
goals as well, to simplify the law. 		<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Absolutely.  <p> 
 
		But, Shirley, I guess maybe I've become a little bit 
cynical, having sat on this committee now for 22 years and 
witnessing the ever-repeating efforts to simplify the Tax Code.<p> 
 
		And I'm -- I also almost think of "reform" as a jaded 
term, because so often we have said, "We're going to reform and 
we're going to simplify."  <p> 
 
		And inevitably, in the process, more and more 
complexities creep in.  <p> 
 
		And I am afraid that that is just the nature of an 
income-based tax.  When you tax income, you tax work, you tax 
productivity, and inevitably you have great differences as to 
defining the terms of "income."  What is "income"?  <p> 
 
		That, again, is another reason why I personally believe 
we should look at taxing goods and services, which can be 
precise, not that there aren't problems.  There are problems with 
whatever you do.<p> 
 
		But I just am not sure that we can, in the end, end up 
with a simple Tax Code if we use income as the base. <p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER PETERSON</b>:  I think your point is very well 
taken, Mr. Chairman.<p> 
 
		And certainly in the work, as I think about it, as this 
Commission approaches it, I hope that we will be thinking about 
restructuring the system and not simply about a reform of the 
current system.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Let me just inform the Commissioners 
that we're just going to go back and forth, give everybody an 
opening round and get to as many questions for Bill in this 
dialogue as possible.<p> 
 
		Ed Feulner.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FEULNER</b>:  Mr. Chairman, I, too, thank you 
for your insights and your continued leadership for so many 
years.  <p> 
 
		One principle that I've not heard you discuss this 
morning that is of concern to me is the notion that, admitted 
that the government has to collect X amount in order to pay its 
bills, as you said, I believe at least that the way it collects 
it ought to be visible and it ought to basically be painful in 
order to put an incentive on the politicians here in Washington 
to not raise it beyond that given level.<p> 
 
		Would you talk to us a little bit about visibility and 
how that relates to different reform proposals.  	<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Well, I'm very -- very empathetic 
to your comments.  <p> 
 
		I've been concerned over the years about withholding on 
the income tax, in effect making the income tax invisible to most 
workers who only think in terms of their net pay, rather than 
what their real salary is.  So, I subscribe to your concerns.<p> 
 
		There are any number of ways you can tax goods and 
services.  You can make it highly visible, or you can make it to 
where it's just built in, embedded in the price of the product.<p> 
 
		I think, however -- and this is only my opinion, 
because we've never tried this -- that it will not be so easy to 
raise any kind of a consumption tax politically if, in fact, it 
is the major, if not the sole, source of raising revenue for the 
federal Treasury.<p> 
 
		I have watched debate after debate --and Jack has been 
through some of these himself when he was a Member of Congress -- 
where there have been proposals to raise the gasoline tax by a 
few pennies.  <p> 
 
		And my view is, is that's hidden in the price of the 
product.  Very few people know when they go to the pump that 
they're paying 39 or 40 cents a gallon in taxes.  They simply see 
the price that's posted up there on the marquee sign.  <p> 
 
		And yet every time that there has been a proposal to 
raise the gas tax by even a few pennies, it is as if the sky was 
falling on everybody over in the House of Representatives.  		
The opposition was so emotional, so intense, that I 
personally think it would be very, very hard, if you put in a tax 
on goods and services, to simply raise it in order to fund a 
larger government.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FEULNER</b>:  Particularly with the VAT 
experience in Europe with the tax.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Well, but you've got to remember 
that's an add-on to the income tax.  And that puts it in entirely 
a different perspective than -- and I'm not here to defend a VAT.  
<p> 
 
		But I think we need to look as broadly as we can and 
recognize that if we do -- if we do completely remove the income 
tax, destroy it, pull it out by its roots, we will be the first 
major developed country in the history of the world to do that.<p> 
 
		And so we've got to understand that the whole chemistry 
changes.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Let me get to Governor Campbell.<p> 
 
		Carroll.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAMPBELL</b>:  Mr. Chairman, thank you very 
much.<p> 
 
		I certainly agree with your comments.  Let me ask you a 
couple of very quick questions.  		Number one, if you're 
going to pull the system out by its roots and really get the 
roots, how do you do it without a constitutional amendment? <p> 
 
		And number two, and I think -- and I'm in favor of it, 
I just wonder how we get to it if we're going to pull it all the 
way out by its roots.<p> 
 
		But, number two, in your comments you said that the 
system must have capital savings and must have incentives for 
savings.  But we wouldn't we look more at long-term savings for 
security and capital formation in a system like that?  Is that 
what you envisioned?<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Oh, absolutely, because if you 
replace a tax on income with a tax on goods and services, you 
would have a zero tax on all of the money that is in everyone's 
paycheck and in what their businesses produce in the way of 
income.  <p> 
 
		And there would be complete and total discretion as to 
what part of those dollars would be spent on consumption and what 
part would be spent on savings.  It would be a zero tax on 
savings.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Let me --<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Now, as far as the 16th Amendment 
is concerned, I would be a supporter of -- and I think there is a 
developing effort in the House right now to repeal the 16th 
Amendment.  And I would certainly support that effort.  <p> 
 
		But obviously, there are two ways to approach anything.  
One is by -- we found this on line-item veto.  I was the first 
person to introduce line-item veto legislation; and it was a 
constitutional amendment in the early '80s, when Reagan came to 
me and asked me to do it.  		We got what we call line item 
veto, but it's statutory -- and the House has already passed this 
year.  <p> 
 
		So, I think that we should move ahead with a simple 
majority and try to get rid of this income tax system.  <p> 
 
		And on a separate track, which I would support, we 
should make the long-term effort to repeal the 16th Amendment.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  I've just been informed that Senator 
Sam Nunn is on his way.  <p> 
 
		I want to get as many questions as possible, so I'll 
turn to Herman Cain.<p> 
 
		Herman.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN</b>:  Thank you, Jack.<p> 
 
		Thanks again, Mr. Archer, for being here.  <p> 
 
		There is no debate, as you indicated, over the fact 
that the current system needs to be thrown out.  And I believe 
that most of the members of this Commission share your goals and 
objectives for what we need to do.<p> 
 
		My question is, quite simply, how do we collectively 
ensure that our recommendations don't stop with the report or 
that what you want to do don't stop with the initiatives that 
you're undertaking?  	<p> 
 
		What do we have to collectively do to make sure that 
whatever is decided is able to actually become implemented?<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Well, you're beginning that 
process right now.  These deliberations are being covered by the 
media.  They will be viewed or read by the people of this 
country.  I hope they will be prominently viewed and read by the 
people of this country.<p> 
 
		Every democracy obviously is pushed along by what is 
put into the minds of the electorate.  But even beyond that, you 
already were selected by the two leaders of the legislative 
branch of this country that will take on the responsibility of 
seeing that we do something.  And I am totally committed to that, 
as you're well aware.  <p> 
 
		And this committee is the beginning point for all tax 
legislation under the Constitution of the United States.  And it 
will be done in this committee.  <p> 
 
		Now, beyond that, I can't say what's going to leverage 
the Senate, but clearly if -- when we get something out of this 
committee, that's going to put tremendous pressure on the Senate 
and also tremendous pressure on the White House.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Ken Blackwell.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER BLACKWELL</b>:  Thank you, <p> 
 
Mr. Chairman.<p> 
 
		Chairman Archer, no industrial country has completely 
jettisoned the income tax system.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Yes.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER BLACKWELL</b>:  So, whether we move from 
income tax -- pulling it up by its roots to a sales tax or the 
present system to a flat tax, or the present system to a more 
simplified system, what are your thoughts on the problems of 
transition?  What do you see as the primary transition problems?<p> 
 
		And an addendum to that question is:  What is your 
thought on this concept of neutrality, revenue, that any change 
in the system is revenue neutral?<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Well, to take the last question 
first, I think we should have a revenue neutral change in the Tax 
Code.  I don't think, number one, it should produce any more 
revenue to give us a larger government.  <p> 
 
		And, number two, if it produces less, then we will, at 
a time when we have committed to get to a balanced budget, we 
will then, in effect, be making that challenge more difficult.<p> 
 
		So, I think we should shoot for revenue neutrality.  <p> 
 
		And obviously part of the difficulty is how we estimate 
it and who's doing the estimating, but that should be as 
objective as possible and as accurate as possible.  <p> 
 
		And we're continuing to refine the model for doing 
estimates and not simply taking the status quo.  And I think we 
can have more confidence as we move along in the estimating 
models.  <p> 
 
		But relative to -- let's see, what was the first part 
again?<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN</b>:  Transition.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  What?<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN</b>:  Issues of transition.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Transition is always a problem.  
Transition was a problem in '86, even though we kept the 
graduated income tax.  And I don't belittle that.  We've just got 
to give a lot of thought as we move along to the various aspects 
of transition, and we won't solve all of the problems.  <p> 
 
		But I would suggest that as the American people look at 
your deliberations and our deliberations, that we catalogue and 
list the advantages and disadvantages of the current system 
compared to the advantages and disadvantages of the replacement.  <p> 
 
		We will not have a perfect replacement.  We will not 
have perfect transition.  But we do need to be assured that, as 
we make this great move, that the transition is done thoughtfully 
and that we don't have major economic dislocations as a result of 
it.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  From the state treasurer of Ohio to the 
state treasurer of the state of California, Matt Fong.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FONG</b>:  Good morning, Chairman Archer.<p> 
 
		I'd like to just expound the question developed by 
Governor Campbell and Treasurer Blackwell dealing with the 16th 
Amendment.  <p> 
 
		I don't fully understand your answer -- or your 
explanation, I should say, on this two-track approach.  <p> 
 
		I'm concerned about, if we move from an income-based 
system to a goods-and-ervices system, that we don't end up with 
an income system and a goods-and-services that it fully replaces.  
<p> 
 
		And without repealing the 16th Amendment head on, I 
don't understand how we can guarantee that we don't have a 
multiple system like they do in Europe.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  I share your concerns.  I will not 
preside over a double system, which is the worst of all worlds.<p> 
 
		I guess if you're looking for guarantees, you shouldn't 
live in a democracy, that with total certainty you can say this 
will never happen.  There are no such things in a democracy.  <p> 
 
		You can make it tougher for certain things to happen.  
But I'm not here to tell you that I have got an all-perfect 
guarantee to all things, because ultimately the people will 
decide.  <p> 
 
		And it's my belief that the people have had enough of 
the income tax, that it will not grow back for many generations 
once we get rid of it, whether we repeal the 16th Amendment or 
not.  Although I think it would be very nice if we could repeal 
the 16th Amendment.  <p> 
 
		But I don't think we should sit back and say, "Oh, but 
wait, something -- we don't want to do this.  It's going to be so 
much better.  But we don't want to do it, because we don't have 
perfection."<p> 
 
		I will simply say this to you, because you're going to 
basically be looking at, I think, three alternatives -- and maybe 
you're creative enough to where you think of four or five or six.  
<p> 
 
		But there are three basic ones that I think are going 
to be out there.<p> 
 
		One is a tax on goods and services, and that has 
multiple methods of accomplishment.  <p> 
 
		The other one is a flat income tax.<p> 
 
		And the third one is some sort of a consumed income 
tax, such as the Nunn-Domenici approach.<p> 
 
		Now, I will simply say to you, without trying to -- 
well, I have my own ideas, obviously, and my own biases, having 
been through reform after reform in this committee.  		And I 
was for a flat tax in 1985-86.  And I was very disappointed that 
Reagan did not put in a -- recommend a true flat tax.  <p> 
 
		But I was focusing internally then on our domestic 
economy.  And I realize now that we have got to reach out and 
focus externally into a worldwide marketplace, which means I 
think we need a different tax system.<p> 
 
		But if you want guarantees, let me simply say to you 
that you shouldn't go to a flat tax without a 16th Amendment 
repeal, because history teaches us that the flat tax leaves the 
roots in the ground for sure and that the tree will grow again.  <p> 
 
		We moved toward a flat tax in 1986.  We didn't get 
there.  But by 1990, the sprouts were already out again.  And by 
'93, the tree was fully grown again.  <p> 
 
		So, if you want to look empirically at history, you 
will see the tree grow very shortly with a flat tax -- in my 
opinion.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FONG</b>:  Mr. Chairman, you said, in 
advocating a tax on goods and services, there are multiple 
sources or ways to do it.  <p> 
 
		I'm thinking of -- most states have a sales tax --<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Yes.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FONG</b>:  -- it seems to me.  And there has 
been the idea in the past that that has been preserved for the 
states.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Yes.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FONG</b>:  The federal government doesn't get 
into that.  <p> 
 
		Governors are very important people and have a lot of 
influence in thinking about the politics of this.  <p> 
 
		Do you see a move by the federal government into that 
type of taxation, as preempting an area that has been reserved to 
the states?  <p> 
 
		And is it a problem that has -- that can be overcome, 
or is it not even a legitimate concern?<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Well, you certainly are going to 
hear that.  And we will hear it.  <p> 
 
		And governors and legislatures will say, "Well, wait a 
minute.  This is going to change our method of operating or 
impact in some way or another on our method of operating."<p> 
 
		I think we have to remember that the states are the 
total receptacle of power for taxation.  The federal government 
has, from the beginning, been, to a degree, limited.  The states 
have complete and total power of taxation under our Constitution.  
<p> 
 
		And the states have the flexibility to adjust and to 
find the best method to raise their revenue, regardless of what 
the federal government does.<p> 
 
		And I don't think it's an automatic barrier once 
governors and legislatures understand the benefits that could 
come if, in fact, you select and believe that a national sales 
tax is the way to go.<p> 
 
		I have not, as I said, yet settled on the vehicle.  I'm 
waiting for you to tell me what you think is the best of the many 
ways to raise taxes -- to put the tax burden on goods and 
services.<p> 
 
		And actually, I will be looking forward to your 
recommendations.  I have other task forces and other people that 
are work evaluating the various methods of going about doing 
this.  		I think the benefits in the end are so beneficial, 
economically, both to the individual, as I mentioned, in the form 
of freedom, total freedom from the IRS, and, secondly, to 
economic development and job creation and productivity.<p> 
 
		America -- if we begin to tax goods and services, 
America will become the sponge for capital savings for the entire 
world.  We will drink up capital savings, and not just 
domestically but from around the world.<p> 
 
		A friend of mine was talking to a Japanese CEO a month 
ago.  And he said, "If America does what is being proposed by <p> 
 
Bill Archer, we will move our international headquarters to the 
United States of America."<p> 
 
		I mean, there are going to be dramatic -- interest 
rates will decline dramatically because money, as we all know it, 
is a fungible product.  <p> 
 
		And there is a free market on money.  It has a price, 
and that price is interest rates.  And when America becomes a 
sponge for capital, interest rates will decline dramatically.<p> 
 
		So, I didn't mean to get into all of this lengthy 
response.  But I think when people begin to understand the 
benefits that can come from this, I believe we can overcome some 
of the political reluctance.  <p> 
 
		There will be -- change is always resisted by people 
who want to believe things are just going to go along the way 
they've always gone.  <p> 
 
		We've got a new breed of governors now -- and Carroll 
Campbell sort of launched that effort some years ago, in putting 
new types of governors into place that are creative.  They're not 
locked into the old mold.<p> 
 
		And I would hope that if we do our sales job right, 
that if, in fact, the sales tax -- national sales tax -- is 
considered the best way to go, that we will be able to handle 
that.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Jack Faris.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FARIS</b>:  Mr. Chairman, one definition of 
"courage" I've heard is living out daily what one professes to 
believe.  <p> 
 
		And if that's an accurate definition, you epitomize 
that in the courage you're taking to take on the whole tax system 
of the <p> 
 
United States.  We applaud you for that.<p> 
 
		As you well know from your deliberations and 
information, that the majority of small business owners pay a lot 
more money in payroll tax than they --  <p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FARIS</b>:  -- do in income tax.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Yes.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FARIS</b>:  And as much as we applaud -- and 
that roar you hear may be from a small business community on Main 
Street when you said, "Take the IRS and close it down."<p> 
 
		But my question then is:  Do you address payroll taxes 
as a part of your approach?<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  I have not at this point committed 
to replace the payroll taxes.  But I think we should look at 
that.  I think we should look, as I said earlier, very broadly, 
very boldly.  <p> 
 
		And there is no question but the payroll taxes are some 
of the more aggressive taxes in this country, as well as some of 
the biggest job deterrents that we have on the books.<p> 
 
		And I have resisted increases in the payroll taxes 
during my entire political career because of that. <p> 
 
		You do take on an added burden.  <p> 
 
		Many people will say, "Oh, well, this is in some way 
going to impact on Social Security."  <p> 
 
		And I think we've got to be very, very careful that we 
let the American public realize that if we do let this new form 
of taxation replace the payroll tax, too, that we will still 
comply with the benefit structure of Social Security and that 
funding would then be transferred from the general Treasury into 
the Social Security fund out of the revenues raised from this 
other form of taxation.<p> 
 
		But I would encourage you to think boldly in your 
recommendations.  And if you come to the conclusion that you 
think it should replace the payroll tax, too, then that's what 
you're here for, to make that recommendation.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FARIS</b>:  Thank you.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  John Wieland, outstanding homebuilder 
from Atlanta, Georgia.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER WIELAND</b>:  Mr. Chairman, you -- it's just 
wonderful to start the hearings this way, in this place and with 
you.<p> 
 
		I think, you know, clearly, the American public wants 
change, but often it seems to me that the American public doesn't 
want to confront the unknown.  <p> 
 
		And I wonder if you would have some suggestions for us 
as to how we might best build consensus with the American public?<p> 
 <b>
		CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Well, I think it's going to take 
effort on the part of a lot of us.  I hope that I have launched 
that the day after the election, when I held a press conference 
in this room and stunned everybody by saying, then, that I wanted 
to do away with the income tax.<p> 
 
		I think at that time an awful lot of<p> 
 
people thought it was extremely radical.  But I think more and 
more people now understand that it is not radical, but it is 
major change.  And there is always resistance to major change.<p> 
 
		You people come from various walks of life, and you 
have other members of your panel who are not here today who will 
be participating.  And you have broad influence in our country.  <p> 
 
		And I think that you, yourselves, could well benefit by 
having someone who would set up a method by which your message 
gets across within your own operation that would be very much 
creative in how you get your message across.  <p> 
 
		It might be -- I don't know how much time you're 
willing to spend on this.  As I said, you're volunteers.  I guess 
you're not being paid for this.  You're volunteers.  <p> 
 
		And you've got busy lives in many other ways.  But it 
seems to me that you could take your show on the road around this 
country.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER WIELAND</b>:  We're going to.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  There are any number of ways that 
you can attempt to get your message across that will bolster what 
we're trying to do here.<p> 
 
		In the end, I can see Jack on <b>Meet the Press</b> and on 
<b>This Week with Brinkley</b> and on <b>Face the Nation</b>  when you reach 
your conclusions.  There are any number of ways that we're going 
to be able to get this message across.  But it <p> 
 
is --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  I'm too shy to do those shows.<p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  What?<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  I'm too shy to do those shows.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Yeah -- oh.<p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		But -- and I didn't mean to select those to --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Right.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  -- to eliminate others -- 
<b>McNeil/Lehrer</b> and all the others.  <p> 
 
		But we do have build consensus.  And the first thing we 
have to do is build a consensus within our majority in the 
Congress.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Right.<p> 
 
		Well, what we're trying to do is inventory the problems 
which you have addressed yourself to quite eloquently, Bill -- 
inventory the solutions.  And we hope you'll come back --<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  I will.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  -- in perhaps the early fall and talk 
about the Archer bill.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  I will.  I will.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Senators Nunn and Domenici are both on 
their way, I've just been informed.  <p> 
 
		But let me take a question and prerogative of the 
Chair.<p> 
 
		You did mention, in passing, that four members of our 
Commission could not be here, all of whom were appointed by the 
Speaker and the Majority Leader of the Senate, Bob Dole.<p> 
 
		Loretta Adams is an entrepreneur -- an impresario, an 
Hispanic businesswoman from <p> 
 
San Diego.<p> 
 
		Governor du Pont, an old buddy of yours, is Carroll's 
counterpart.<p> 
 
		And Teddy Forstmann, of Forstmann, Little, one of our 
Nation's outstanding entrepreneurs and financiers.<p> 
 
		And John Snow, chairman of CSX. <p> 
 
		In my opening comment, I quoted President Kennedy, who 
said, in '62, that the paradox of tax reform is that many times 
high rates cause less revenue.  <p> 
 
		And setting the rates at a level of equilibrium at 
which people are willing to maximize their output and still pay 
tax in a peacetime economy is really going to take a Solomon-like 
decision.  Albeit in a democracy, there will be give and take.<p> 
 
		One of the questions I have for you, Mr. Chairman, is, 
if a principle --<p> 
 
		(End tape 1, side 1)<p> 
 
		-- for a government's legitimate purposes, a corollary 
to that, or secondary to that principle, is upon whom should the 
burden of that tax be placed?<p> 
 
		I don't think there's any -- I watched you and Charlie 
Rangel go toe to toe.  And he's a friend of yours and a good 
friend of mine.  		And he kept bringing up the issue -- I'm 
not speaking for him, but it's an issue that all of us have to 
address in this debate, "fairness."<p> 
 
		We wouldn't tax a teenager who's starting out in life.  
We wouldn't tax an apprentice starting his or her first rung of 
the ladder that we euphemistically call <i>the American Dream</i>, but 
you reminded us today is a "universal" dream.  <p> 
 
		How do we adjust the Code -- i.e., the rate -- so that 
the burden falls on those most able to pay, but in such a way as 
it does not reduce their ability to save, invest, and work, and 
take that risk that is so important to the creation of wealth?<p> 
 
		As a principle, what is in your mind about making sure 
that the weakest elements of our society -- the woman coming off 
of welfare, taking her first job -- how do you make sure that a 
sales tax, if it is a consumption tax, is not placed in such a 
way as those with the least amount of disposable income in our 
society are paying too heavy a burden?<p> 
 
		I don't say that to argue.  I say that to raise issues 
--<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  No, I understand.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  -- that I know are going to be raised 
by our colleagues in this great democratic -- small "d" -- 
debate.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Well -- and we must be prepared to 
come to grips with that issue.  That is a very, very big issue.  
And it's one that we struggle with here, in the Congress, over 
and over and over again.  <p> 
 
		It, in a sense, is one of the big conundrums as to how 
we tax; because on the one hand. we say those who are able to pay 
the most should pay the most.  And I don't think people will 
argue with that.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Right.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  But what is "the most"?  <p> 
 
		And what is the relative incline in taking assets away 
from those who are in a position to create jobs?<p> 
 
		It takes, today, $280,000 per job of invested capital 
in the United States.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  How much?<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  $280,000.<p> 
 
		Now, Jack, your members probably would not spend that 
much in small businesses, but that's the average across the 
board.<p> 
 
		Now, $280,000, in the minds of those who want to tax 
wealth, is a large amount of money.  <p> 
 
		So, if you adopt the concept that we have got to take a 
big chunk away from someone who has $280,000 to invest, you're in 
effect destroying jobs.<p> 
 
		So the conundrum is:  How do you continue the savings 
and invested capital to create the better-paying job, to increase 
real family income in the paychecks, and at the same time say, 
"Well, we're really going to hit those people"?  <p> 
 
		And we have never found a valid answer to that over the 
years, I don't think, in this country.  <p> 
 
		But the one thing that we do know is no matter how we 
manipulated the Code by those who would socially engineer it, we 
have not changed the basic percentage of ownership of wealth in 
this country.  We have not succeeded in redistributing wealth.  <p> 
 
		It may sound good from a rhetorical standpoint on a 
political stump, but the reality is that it has not worked.<p> 
 
		But one interesting thing, which you know better than 
anybody else, is when the rates were reduced in 1986 -- and that 
was the benefit of the '86 Act, in spite of all of the bad parts 
of it -- the people in the very highest income effectively paid 
more, with a lower rate, of the percentage of the money that came 
in to fund the federal government. <p> 
 
		Now, that doesn't fit within the political rhetoric of 
those who always want to sic the poor against the rich and the 
rich against the poor, in creating economic class struggles in 
this country.<p> 
 
		But so long as we have a democracy with a free 
enterprise, capitalistic society, we're going to need people who 
have wealth to create jobs.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Of course, that top <p> 
 
10 percent changes every 20 years.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  And that's true, too.  I mean, 
that's also true of these distribution tables on which all of our 
proposals are judged, that what does this do for this income 
class, acts as if people stay in that income class all of their 
lives, and they don't.  <p> 
 
		We know the studies show that Americans are moving up 
and down the ladder every year, and that's the secret in this 
country.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Do you have a minute or two to take a 
couple more questions?<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Yes, if you've got a minute or two 
to listen to long answers.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Well, Nunn and Domenici are on their 
way. <p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Okay.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  They were on the floor of the Senate 
when I got word that they were walking over.  So. I'll let them. <p> 
 
		Raise your hands if you have -- <p> 
 
		Governor Campbell -- Carroll.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAMPBELL</b>:  Thank you.<p> 
 
		Mr. Chairman, the issue of equity and fairness often is 
in the way it's explained.  <p> 
 
		If you had a 20 percent flat tax and you told somebody 
that "Somebody who made $200,000 is going to pay a $40,000 tax; 
and if you make $20,000, you're going to pay a $4,000.  Is that 
fair?" -- they'd probably all say, "Yeah, that's fair."<p> 
 
		Oftentimes it's not explained in, you know, exactly 
those terms.  And so when you look at the tax from a flat tax 
standpoint, then I think you could explain the equity of it.<p> 
 
		The other thing that I was very interested in -- and 
you kept going back to --was the creation of the capital base in 
the country, which we have to have, which has got to come from 
people's savings, long-term savings.  <p> 
 
		And I guess that comment let's me have a segue into 
what we're doing today to keep the government from growing back.  <p> 
 
		And I speak of the headlines in papers about baby 
boomers not preparing for the future, not ready for the future, 
and things like that <p> 
 
-- and as to whether we should address that as an incentive need.  
<p> 
 
		All of these things deal with the equity.  And the 
reason that one deals with equity is if they don't prepare, 
you're going to have to tax somebody else more to take care of 
them in the future.  <p> 
 
		And I think that's all part of what we're doing.  I 
don't mean to overstate that.  <p> 
 
		I guess the one thing that I wanted to ask you, from 
the consumption tax standpoint, you made the comment about states 
and the conflict, and that was raised.  There actually is, in the 
system today, another layer of that taxation.<p> 
 
		And one is simple.  You have a state sales tax.  Then, 
in many instances, you have a county sales tax.  And in many 
instances, you have a city sales tax or a tax on things.  <p> 
 
		So that tiered system is there at different levels of 
government.  I'm not so sure it would be as difficult as some 
have raised the specter of.  <p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Well, I do think that the fairness 
and the regressivity concern is an important one.  And it has 
been raised by a couple of you, and I share that concern.  <p> 
 
		And I think when you do get into the very lower-income 
people -- first, let me say that if you put a tax on good and 
services, the Social Security recipient, the retired person who 
is living off their Social Security benefits, would immediately 
be made whole by <p> 
 
the COLA.  So, there would be no disadvantage to a retired person 
on Social Security.  <p> 
 
		If you are at the very bottom and you're on welfare, 
you would be made whole by an increase in your welfare benefits 
that would keep pace with the CPI.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Mm-hmm.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Now, the question though, then, is 
when you get above the threshold of being on welfare and you're 
in a lower income category as a worker, I think we do have to be 
concerned about some credit rebate or waiver system that would 
not punish those people.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Bill, you've really done us a great 
service.<p>

<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  I congratulate you on taking this job, 
because I don't know of any job that's more challenging, but also 
has more potential for really accomplishing something for 
American people and the future income and economic growth of our 
country.<p> 
 
		Mr. Chairman, you're right.  You and I started in the 
tax business together about the same time.  You were out in front 
of me, I think, you and Bill Roth.  And then I came trailing in 
about 1978.  But I've been involved a long time.  		<p> 
 
		And I never will forget when we passed a resolution in 
the Senate urging the Finance Committee and the Ways and Means 
Committee to basically -- well, actually, we passed the bill in 
the Senate called the "Nunn-Chiles bill" and you passed a 
resolution.  <p> 
 
		You came back on a flight and passed a resolution in 
the House to urge the House conferees to accept it, which had 
already passed the Senate two-thirds.  Your vote passed by <p> 
 
two-thirds.  Lo and behold, the Conference kicked the whole thing 
out and put in some language. <p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Right.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  That was about 1978.  And I always 
contended to President Carter -- at that time President Carter -- 
that had the administration supported it at that time, the 1980 
election might have been different, because that was a 
fundamental point in our history.  But I wanted to --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>: I will resist a comment on that.<p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  I don't think he agreed either.   <p> 
 
		But, Mr. Chairman, Senator Domenici is coming in just a 
few minutes.  And I thought I'd lead off just with a few informal 
remarks.  I would like to have had a statement prepared, but I've 
been caught between the Defense markup -- in fact, we're meeting 
now.  So, I'm going to make my remarks brief.  <p> 
 
		And then Senator Domenici will probably come in, in the 
middle.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Okay.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  We just had a vote on a securities 
matter.<p> 
 
		The fundamental point of economic policy, we believe -- 
Senator Domenici and I, and I think we see this alike -- is to 
promote the long-term growth and a higher standing of living in 
the American people.<p> 
 
		Now, the growth and higher standard of living of our 
country depend on productivity, depend on our people being more 
productive.  And that increased productivity depends on increased 
investment.  <p> 
 
		And increased investment depends on fundamental 
savings.  And that is the heart of what we're talking about.  And 
we believe that's the heart of what's wrong with our Tax Code 
today.  <p> 
 
		Because without savings, you don't get investment.  
Without investment, you don't get productivity.  And without 
productivity, you do not get the kind of increases in our 
standard of living and economic growth that we all, I think, 
desire.<p> 
 
		The bottom line is that savings relates directly to 
jobs, and higher-paying jobs, because it all goes together.  <p> 
 
		So, what we set out to do was to address that 
fundamental problem that affects our economic growth and also the 
pay of the American worker.<p> 
 
		The U.S. national savings rate is very low, as we all 
know.  That trend started in the 1970s, but continues to this 
day.  <p> 
 
		We've had about 20 years of much lower savings.  And it 
is demonstrated very vividly in all the charts on investment and 
certainly those charts where we're compared to Japan, but not 
just Japan.  Almost any country in the world, or any industrial 
country is out-saving us and out-investing us.<p> 
 
		And, of course, the economists tell us that national 
investment equals national savings, plus, of course, imported 
capital.  And we've gotten our investment primarily because we 
have imported capital over the last two decades.<p> 
 
		Now, the question is:  Why do we have such low savings?  
<p> 
 
		I don't sit here before this tax panel and try to 
contend that it's all related to the Tax Code.  I think that's a 
fundamental part of it, but it's also cultural, and it also 
relates to the overall budget deficit.  <p> 
 
		We're trying to address that budget deficit, but it 
fundamentally cuts into our savings, our net savings as a Nation.<p> 
 
		The Tax Code today, Mr. Chairman -- and you ask, in the 
letter:  What's wrong with our current Code?  <p> 
 
		And, of course, if the American people come to the 
conclusion that we do need to change the Tax Code, it will be 
because they believe there are fundamental problems with it. <p> 
 
		So, what's wrong with our Tax Code today?<p> 
 
		Senator Domenici and I believe that the fundamental 
problem with our Tax Code is that it taxes savers twice and it 
taxes investors twice.  It taxes consumers once.<p> 
 
		So, naturally the laws of economics and incentives mean 
that if you are taxed twice if you save, but once if you consume, 
there is more incentive to consume than to save. <p> 
 
		We're trying to level the playing field.  We're trying 
to say that savers are basically not penalized, that there's no 
bias against savings in the Tax Code.  That was our fundamental 
goal.<p> 
 
		The corporate level also demonstrates that, in effect, 
corporate earnings are taxed twice.  They're taxed once at the 
company level; and when they're distributed as dividends, they're 
taxed again.<p> 
 
		And, of course, if the corporate rate is higher than 
the individual rate, people in lower brackets who are investors 
are taxed at a higher rate at the corporate level than they would 
be taxed if the money was distributed directly to them to begin 
with.<p> 
 
		So, both the business side and the individual side we 
believe are biased against people who save.<p> 
 
		We have a number of goals.  But when we get down to the 
question of what is the effect of savings, I think it has been 
said many times in many different reports.<p> 
 
		The most recent one I've read -- <p> 
 
Martin Feldstein had an editorial in the <b>Economist</b> magazine last 
week that said "Save and Prosper."   <p> 
 
		In fact, high-savings countries have high rates of 
investment, whereas low-savings countries have low rates of 
investment.<p> 
 
		Lots of people have said pretty much the same thing.  
And I think the evidence is pretty overwhelming.  <p> 
 
		So, our goals were several.  <p> 
 
		The first -- the first goal was that we believe that 
any tax system should be designed, as far as possible, to finance 
the real needs of government with the least damage to economic 
growth.  <p> 
 
		I suppose it's hard to find any tax that promotes 
economic growth.  Some are worse than others.  And what we think 
we ought to try to do is design a tax system that does the least 
harm to economic growth.<p> 
 
		A second goal was to remove the bias against savers -- 
I've already alluded to that <p> 
 
-- allowing savings and investment to move to the place where 
they make the most sense, as dictated by the market and by free 
decisions of free people.                                  <p> 
 
		The third goal is to reduce the complexity of the Tax 
Code.  And that means to have understandable principles.  This 
reducing complexity has been the goal of almost every tax reform 
movement that I know anything about.  It never seems to happen.  <p> 
 
		But at the very least, we ought to make the principles 
of the Tax Code understandable, and we ought to strive for 
simplicity.	<p> 
 
		I don't think we ought to strive so much for simplicity 
that we ignore economic effect and that we ignore the basic 
fairness element.  But I do think simplicity ought to be a 
fundamental part of the goal.<p> 
 
		The fourth goal that we had in our proposal was to try 
modernize the American tax system based on the competitive 
reality of the world.  We don't have a level playing field now.  		We actually have a tax system that 
puts us at a 
disadvantage vis-a-vis the Europeans and Japanese and other 
competitors.  In effect, they have a value-added tax to finance a 
great portion of their government.  So, goods in their country 
that are exported, they get a rebate.  They are not taxed, 
basically.<p> 
 
		Our goods carry with them abroad the tax system of our 
country and the tax rates of our country.  <p> 
 
		On the other hand, when we ship good to Europe or 
Japan, those goods are taxed with their value added.  Now, when 
they ship goods here, they don't have a similar tax.<p> 
 
		So, we're trying to level the playing field 
competitively.  That's another very important goal.  <p> 
 
		The way we address that -- and there may be other ways 
-- but we found this one to be the most satisfying, at least from 
our perspective -- is that our tax is territorial.  It applies to 
all sales on U.S. soil, no matter where the business is 
headquartered.  <p> 
 
		If you're headquartered in New York or you're 
headquartered in California or you're headquartered in Georgia, 
your goods that are sold in the American market under our 
proposal would be taxed at the same rate as goods that are made 
in England or Germany or France or Mexico or South Korea that are 
imported into this country.<p> 
 
		So, we have a territorial tax.  It is border 
adjustable.  And that would put us on the same level playing 
field with Japan and Europe and others.  <p> 
 
		That is to say if an American company is located in 
Europe and sells outside the United States, they would not be 
taxed.  We'd get rid of a huge amount of complexity if the sales 
are outside the United States or a subsidiary.  <p> 
 
		On the other hand, if they are located in another 
country, Mexico or anywhere else, and they are producing there 
and shipping back into this country, their goods are taxed 
exactly as if they were made in the United States, and we would 
indeed have a level playing field.<p> 
 
		Some of our trading partners may raise a complaint 
about this.  We believe it's <p> 
 
GATT-compliant.  We've structured it to be <p> 
 
GATT- compliant.  We think that's important.<p> 
 
		But nevertheless, we think that a level playing field, 
in this day of competition and international competition, is 
essential for the American businesses.<p> 
 
		The final goal that I will mention this morning is that 
it be perceived as fair.  <p> 
 
		I think a tax system can be defined as working if it 
promotes economic growth and raises a standard of living to the 
American people.  But if it's going to endure, it's going to have 
to be fair.  <p> 
 
		You can pass a bill, might even get it signed into law, 
but it will not last if the American people come to the 
conclusion that it is not fair.  <p> 
 
		That's the hard part.  It's hard to blend fairness and 
simplicity.  Those two sometimes work apart.<p> 
 
		The way we tried to approach the fairness issue, we 
kept progress rates.  I know there'll be disagreement on that.  <p> 
 
		You could take our system and you could make flat rates 
of it if you wanted.  We believe that progress rates, though, in 
this system, where savings are fundamentally deducted, where you 
deduct your savings, you deduct your investment before you pay 
your tax, the marginal rate takes on a totally different nature 
than the marginal rate now, where you have not been able to 
deduct savings.<p> 
 
		So, we kept progressive rates, but we fundamentally, we 
think, changed the equation on the effect of those progressive 
rates on investment and on savings.<p> 
 
		We also have a family living allowance which does not 
exist under the current Tax Code.  We kept the standard 
deduction, so you get an extra standard -- you get an extra 
family living allowance, recognizing that low-income people are 
not going to be able as much as <p> 
 
higher-income people.  That's just a fact of life.<p> 
 
		We strengthened the earned-income tax credit.  We 
increased that so that we make it more enticing and give more 
incentive for people to work, rather than the other way around.  <p> 
 
		There would be a larger earned income tax credit.  We 
know there are some problems in administering that, and we don't 
ignore those, but we think that, still, that principle is 
absolutely essential.<p> 
 
		And then, finally -- and I'll close with this, Mr. 
Chairman -- we believe the most regressive part of our current 
Tax Code is the FICA tax, the employee and employer Social 
Security and Medicare tax.  <p> 
 
		In effect, it's regressive because it cuts off -- most 
of it cuts off at $60,000.  Low-income people pay a higher 
proportion of their income for FICA taxes than higher-income 
people.  It also is a tax on jobs.  <p> 
 
		We know if you want to get rid of anything, you tax it 
enough.  Well, we've got a big tax on jobs in this country.  And 
I think that is one of the biggest impediments that <p> 
 
low-income and low-skilled American people face is that FICA tax 
that every employer looks at before they hire someone.  They're 
talking about another 14 percent.<p> 
 
		So, what we do is we calibrate our rates so that the 
employee gets a full credit back against their income tax -- not 
a deduction, but a credit back against their income tax, dollar 
for dollar, for the FICA taxes paid.  The same thing for the 
employer.  <p> 
 
		We believe that feature should be incorporated in any 
tax code that you come up with.<p> 
 
		I know you want to have some dialogue.  I don't know 
whether my colleague, <p> 
 
Senator Domenici, is here or not.  But I will just close with 
those very scattered remarks and invite your comments and 
questions.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Well, Senator, thank you very much for 
that eloquent testimony. <p> 
 
		I'd like to take the prerogative of the Chair and turn 
it over, for the first question, to your constituent, John 
Wieland of Atlanta Georgia, one of our Nation's most productive 
homebuilders.  <p> 
 
		And, John, take it away.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER WIELAND</b>:  It has been suggested that a 
fundamental change in the income tax might not last for long, 
that the income tax after that change is going to continue to 
grow back to perhaps what we know it today.<p> 
 
		How can you -- how can we be sure that we made a tax 
and kept an income tax, that that wouldn't happen?<p> 
 
		<b>PARTICIPANT</b>:  That it would not simply be repealed, is 
that what you --<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER WIELAND;</b>  Yes.  And it wouldn't grow back, 
you know, in an effort raise taxes, whatever the White House 
thinks is appropriate.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  Well, I believe that's one of the 
problems and challenges with a flat tax, because if you get rid 
of all the deductions with a flat tax and then get the rate down 
in exchange for that -- we have only to look at the Act of '86.  <p> 
 
		What happens is the rates start going back up, but you 
still don't get your deductions back.  I think that's a real a 
problem.<p> 
 
		We kept what we considered to be the essential 
deductions that we believe the American people want and will 
demand over a period of time.  <p> 
 
		We kept the deduction for home mortgages, and we kept 
the deduction for charities in our proposal.  <p> 
 
		We do eliminate a number of other deductions.  You can 
eliminate any number of deductions -- current deductions you'd 
like in a Code and you can lower the rate to do that.  <p> 
 
		But if you do that one time and you get rid of all of 
them and then people come back and raise the rate, then you have 
a real disincentive. <p> 
 
		We believe that once you put in law that savings and 
investment are deducted at the individual level, that that 
deduction will remain.  We believe that will be so clearly 
understood and will be such a driving force in the economy, that 
that one will not be subject to change.<p> 
 
		A future Congress might decide they want a higher rate.  
But if you keep the basic premise that a person that takes $100 
and puts it in a bank account or $1,000, they get to deduct that 
before they pay their taxes, I believe there would be strong 
support for that one that it would not change, because it would 
be perceived to allow people to be building for their future.<p> 
 
		The other thing that I think is so important here -- as 
we reform the entitlement programs, we all know, as we sit here, 
there is no way in the world we're going to be able to keep the 
Social Security system the way it is today for people who are now 
20, 30, 40 years old.  <p> 
 
		We can protect those who are already retired, and we 
should, or those who are about to retire.  But the people in 
their 20s and 30s and 40s are going to have to retire at a higher 
age.  I don't think there's any doubt about that.<p> 
 
		We believe that tax reform goes with entitlement 
reform, because people are going to have to be -- and younger 
people particularly are going to have to be given an ability to 
save money over a period of time so they can augment the 
retirement programs that will hopefully still exist when they get 
there.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Dean Kleckner, on the far left.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER KLECKNER</b>:  Senator, it seems to me that 
the debate, as we go on through the year, will center on tax 
change or tax reforms that focus on social policy, on fear of the 
government -- fear of the tax collection process itself, IRS, and 
economics -- with economics probably ending up third in that 
triumvirate, where it should be first.<p> 
 
		What -- and I like -- I agree with many things you said 
here.  I like the thrust that you and Senator Domenici are 
talking about.  <p> 
 
		But what can we do?  What advice do you have for us -- 
because we're going to be talking not only back to you, but to 
the American people -- to bring economics more to the forefront 
and get away from the social agenda, which you can't ever 
eliminate, and the fear of the government, fear of the IRS, which 
I think is rising -- the fear of the government is rising amongst 
the American people.  <p> 
 
		What do we do, what do we focus on to bring it to the 
economic agenda? <p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  That's a tough question. and I wouldn't 
presume to be able to give you a complete answer on that.  <p> 
 
		I would say that I believe we have a Tax Code that is 
so complex today that the people who are administering it in the 
IRS don't understand it themselves.  <p> 
 
		And if they don't understand it, the average person out 
there on the firing line in the IRS -- or at least if there are 
fundamental features they don't understand, then the way they 
administer it is going to be perceived by the people that they're 
dealing with, the public, as being both ill-informed and unfair.  
And I think there's a growing sense of that.<p> 
 
		So, I believe the Congress of the United States and 
this Commission will be making recommendations to the Congress of 
the <p> 
 
United States and to the President -- next President.  <p> 
 
		I believe that you have a real opportunity here to try 
to come up with some clarity; because if the IRS can't understand 
it, no one else can.  <p> 
 
		And I think that it's really almost unfair to the 
Internal Revenue Service agents out there.  Far be it from me to 
defend them.  I know that's not politically correct to defend the 
IRS, and I'm not going to do it here today.  		But I 
would say that they, themselves. will tell you, when you talk to 
them privately, there's lots of this Code that they can't 
understand themselves, or that it's so complex they're not 
capable of explaining it to people.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Jack Faris, an old friend of yours, of 
NFIB.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FARIS</b>:  Senator, we thank you for your 
leadership.  You've been working on this for a while, as you 
mentioned earlier, and we thank you for that.<p> 
 
		Yet, one of the things that concerns the small business 
owners around the country is: "I'm spending my life building into 
a business and building a company and building a reputation, 
taking less out and putting more in, to build something for my 
family."  The whole area of inheritance and the state taxes.<p> 
 
		We hope we'll save the family farm, ranch, and 
business, and the jobs located in those businesses.  <p> 
 
		Does your proposal include the elimination of those 
inheritance taxes or exempts the smaller, privately owned company 
to be able to be passed down to the family and employees?<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  Our proposal does not touch anything but 
the income tax.  We don't pretend to have addressed the estate 
tax.  <p> 
 
		I personally, individually -- and I'm not speaking for 
the group that came up with this proposal or for Senator 
Domenici, but I believe he shares this.  <p> 
 
		I think if we keep our current Internal Revenue Code 
that we have now, we have to increase the estate tax exemption 
for small businesses.  I think it has to be updated.  So, I don't 
favor the present estate tax with the present Code.<p> 
 
		We have to be careful in this proposal, though, because 
in this proposal, if you take -- if you make $100,000 and you 
save 20 of that, that money is deferred.  Eventually you're going 
to pay taxes on it.  <p> 
 
		But if you keep that invested, you will never pay taxes 
on it.  And then you pass away, you die, and at that stage there 
has to be some incidence of taxation.  So, we would not abolish 
the estate tax.  <p> 
 
		I don't think abolishing the estate tax plus this 
deferred tax on savings and investment would go together.  I 
think that would be a conflict, because then you would have not 
just a deferral of tax, you would have tax that would never -- I 
mean, you'd have income that would never be taxed. <p> 
 
		So, under the current Code, I favor reforming the 
estate tax.  I hope we can make a fundamental reform, which would 
mean the estate tax could then be modernized based on the new 
system.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Matt Fong.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSION FONG</b>:  Senator Nunn, in the different 
consumption proposals, yours seems to -- your use of the tax 
initiative seems to have a degree of preference for the tax-exempt market that the others do not.  Can you 
explain your --<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  For the -- for the what?<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FONG</b>:  Tax-exempt market.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  Like municipals and --<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FONG</b>:  Municipals, yes.	<p> 
 
		Can you explain your rationale for giving a preference 
for this, that the others have not done so?<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  I haven't studied the other tax 
proposals on that feature.  But financing local government and 
state government is a key part of our overall responsibilities.  
We don't want to do something at the federal level that wrecks 
the local and state government ability to finance.<p> 
 
		Now, what we do, by letting you put money in a savings 
account, the earnings on -- and that's deductible -- we level the 
playing field somewhat with municipal and state bonds.  <p> 
 
		But we still give a preference to municipal and state 
bonds by saying that the income off of those -- let's say you get 
$5,000 a year off of your municipal bonds, that income, even if 
you consume it, would not be taxed. <p> 
 
		We believe under the Constitution and under our system 
of state government, local government, and federalism, that we 
should not do something at the federal level that's going to 
cripple the ability of state and local governments to raise 
money.<p> 
 
		And we think that preference would still be enticing to 
people for investment purposes.  In effect, people who invest in 
those bonds are paying taxes.  They're paying taxes by a lower 
rate.  They are, in effect, subsidizing state and local 
government by taking a rate that would be lower than they would 
otherwise receive.<p> 
 
		That's a hard concept to explain, but I think it's 
true.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER</b>:  Senator Nunn -- <p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Excuse me, waiting to testify and with 
a short time is our friend Dick Armey, the Majority leader of the 
House.<p> 
 
		So, if Pete Domenici cannot make it, Sam, when you 
finish, we will then have Dick Armey.  And I would ask that the 
questions be as brief as possible so we can get to Dick.<p> 
 
		Thank you.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER</b>:  Thank you very much for being here, 
Senator Nunn.	<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  Thank you.	<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER</b>:  You explained your approach and how it 
leveled the global playing field.  <p> 
 
		One of my concerns is, with a major change, using 
either one of the approaches that's on the table, how do we 
adjust for the fact that a large percentage of the population 
will not be at the same starting point?<p> 
 
		You know, you've got some that are much further behind 
in this whole equation, and you start talking about incenting 
(sic) savings when you've got a group of people who are not even 
at the same starting point.  How does your approach address the 
inequity there?<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  Well, as I mentioned, the FICA Tax 
rebate would make a huge difference for low-income people.  <p> 
 
		It would also make a big difference for small 
businesses that really need to expand but can't afford to add 
another 14 percent to the minimum wage, plus whatever they're 
paying.  <p> 
 
		So, those two features I think are important.<p> 
 
		We also keep the rates progressive, so that if someone 
for very -- we're not trying to tax wealth as long as wealth as 
long as wealth is working for jobs -- for all of us.<p> 
 
		But if I'm a borrower, and I don't save any money, but 
someone else is saving money, that person saving money helps me, 
because I'm going to be able to borrow at less interest rate than 
I otherwise would.  <p> 
 
		So, I think that concept is important.  		I 
would also say that we would help grow the economy.  I believe 
the economic pie is going to grow when savings increase and 
investments increase.  And therefore I think the job growth is 
going to be here.<p> 
 
		We also have another feature that I did not emphasize 
today that addresses the human capital need.  And that is the 
$2,000 deduction per person for higher education or for skilled 
training.  <p> 
 
		We think all of those features are important.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Carroll or Shirley.    		 
<b>COMMISSIONER CAMPBELL</b>:  One quick question.  And --		<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  Let me add one other thing on that 
point.  <p> 
 
		But right now a person in, let's say, a modest-income 
bracket -- middle-income -- middle-, low-income -- they have a 
very hard time saving money.  <p> 
 
		We think our proposal would allow them to save money 
and get that capital that they need to begin small businesses, or 
for education or health purposes, or whatever they need.  <p> 
 
		Right now they have a very difficult time saving 
because they're paying taxes before they are able to put away 
savings.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Carroll Campbell.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAMPBELL</b>:  Senator, very briefly, you 
mentioned that younger people must be given encouragement and 
ability to save.  Do you treat long-term savings any different in 
yours than short-term savings?<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  No.  If you pull it out of savings, and 
it goes into your consumption stream --<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAMPBELL</b>:  Right back.  That's what I --<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  -- and you pay taxes on it.  It's a 
year-end calculation.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAMPBELL:</b>  Okay.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Shirley Peterson.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN:</b>  So to the extent that you saved it over 
the year, then you would get a deduction.  <p> 
 
		If you just saved it for two months, and you didn't 
have that savings accumulated at the year-end, you would not get 
a deduction.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAMPBELL</b>:  The earnings on that savings as 
it's invested builds up tax-free, though, I believe I heard you 
say.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  As long as you reinvest it.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAMPBELL</b>:  As long as it stays in?<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN:  Right</b>. <p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAMPBELL</b>:  Yes.	<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  Right.  If you go out and you get your 
earnings off that investment and you get a portrait painted of 
yourself, then you get taxed.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAMPBELL:</b>  But as long as it stays there 
and keeps earning?<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  If you put it in a savings account where 
I can borrow it, and Jack can borrow it, and others can borrow 
it, then you get earning.<p> 
 
		The other feature that I would think is very attractive 
about this is capital gains.  This proposal would end the debate 
on capital gains; because if you took your capital gain and 
reinvested it, then it's deducted.  It's deferred.  <p> 
 
		But if you take your capital gains and consume it and 
spend it, then it's not.  <p> 
 
		For the first time, we can honestly say to the taxi 
driver, or the bank teller, or the person working as a school 
teacher, or anyone else, "Your income is no different from the 
investor's income that has a capital gain.<p> 
 
		"If you make $45,000 a year and you save $5,000, you're 
going to defer taxes on that.  <p> 
 
		"If a millionaire makes $5,000 capital gain, they're 
going to defer taxes if they reinvest it.  But if they consume 
it, they're going to pay taxes, just as you."<p> 
 
		It gets rid of this class debate on capital gains.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Senator Nunn has been joined by the 
distinguished Budget Chairman, Pete Domenici -- Senator Domenici.	<p> 
 
		Thank you, Pete, for coming over.  I know your schedule 
is brief.  <p> 
 
		The Chair has never been in this position before, 
caught in the ultimate conundrum of two distinguished U.S. 
Senators on both sides of the aisle and their important 
contribution to this debate, with Dick Armey sitting on the 
sidelines.<p> 
 
		Pete, do you have a -- Sam has been for a half-hour, 
talking with the Commission.  This is just a dialogue.  <p> 
 
		Do you want to share with us your perspective on the 
problems that you saw in the Code that led to your Domenici-Nunn 
bill.  		And thank you so much, Pete, for being here.

<p>
<p>
<center>REMARKS OF<a name="Pete V. Domenici"> SENATOR PETE V. DOMENICI</a></center> 
<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR DOMENICI</b>:  Thank you, <p> 
 
Mr. Chairman.		<p> 
 
		And I look around and I know most of you, some of your 
very well.  <p> 
 
		And I, first of all, what to congratulate you on 
accepting the responsibility of being on this advisory group.  I 
think it's absolutely critical that we do the right thing with 
tax reform and do it soon.<p> 
 
		My own thinking is very simple.  The Tax Code and the 
fiscal policy of this Nation have more to do with the future of 
our people than any other policies we talk about.  All others are 
dwarfed.  <p> 
 
		If we don't have the right fiscal policy and we don't 
have the right tax policy, we don't have "Opportunity America."  <p> 
 
		This Tax Code that we've got is backward.  It penalizes 
savings, penalizes investments.  And everything about it is kind 
of wrong-headed.<p> 
 
		I think it's so far off the mark.  And as to 
corporations, it is so cumbersome and so difficult that we ought 
to just throw the whole thing out.  <p> 
 
		So, we didn't start with the premise of tinkering with 
it.  We said, Let's have a whole new approach.<p> 
 
		I assume my friend and colleague, who has worked 
diligently on this and knows it very, very well -- frankly, we 
both worked hard enough, Chairman Kemp, that I think we can move 
over to the Finance Committee and help them a little.<p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		He's an armed service expert.  I'm supposedly a budget 
expert.  But I think we understand the Code now -- not in detail 
like some of you on this Commission.  <p> 
 
		But let me just say, I believe if you look at the 
corporate reform that's in this, you can't help but think it's 
something America ought to have.<p> 
 
		Simple as could be for those who understand corporate 
America, when the terrible things and these awful amortization-depreciation schedules that are audited ad 
nauseam that all kind 
of lawyers play around with and accountants spend millions on 
essentially put American business, not corporations, on a cash 
basis, that means they deduct what they purchase by way of 
equipment and the like.  <p> 
 
		At a point in time when this is passed, you'll get off 
all the things that bring accountants now from the Internal 
Revenue Service into our corporate headquarters, and they camp in 
some of them all year long -- some of you know that -- as to be 
compared with Japan, where they don't have such things.<p> 
 
		And we also make it border-adjustable.  We have to go 
through a process to do that, but I think it's very, very 
important that if you're going to reform the Tax Code, you tell 
the American people that American corporations will no longer be 
penalized as they sell in the world market vis-a-vis our foreign 
corporations that sell to us, or even American corporations.  <p> 
 
		So, we essentially have a flat, easy tax for 
corporations, and they're taxed as if they were in Atlanta, 
Georgia; or Albuquerque --even if they're overseas.  <p> 
 
		We don't think that's going to be onerous, but we think 
it's very fair.  It permits us to get down to that flat tax of 
about 10.5 percent.<p> 
 
		On the individual side, we can go through a lot of 
details, but we had some very simple but positive goals, and they 
were to increase American savings and increase investment by 
American people in productive things.  <p> 
 
		And we ended up considering the American savings pool 
to be sufficiently significant for America's future, to where we 
will give our citizens a tax break of significant proportions if 
they put their money in the savings pool.  And we won't tax them 
on it so long as they give it to that pool, which helps America.  <p> 
 
		So, right off the bat, this approach says anything you 
want to save, in any quantities you want to save, for anything 
you want to save.  Kind of a universal IRA.  You can do that.  <p> 
 
		But it also says we don't need a capital gains argument 
in America.  If you invest your money, you leave it there to be 
turned and churned and reinvested.  You don't pay tax, because we 
think the investment pool owned by individuals and investment 
entities is good for America.  <p> 
 
		So, we're saying to Americans, if you do that with your 
money, you don't pay income tax on it.  <p> 
 
		The upshot of it is we tax in a progressive way, and we 
thought progressivity was important.  It may not be, as you look 
at it.  But I would assume it may be hard to pass something that 
is not progressive.  We think it's good for America that it be 
progressive.  <p> 
 
		So, we have three brackets, but you can have whatever 
you would like.  And you only pay on what you spend, because 
essentially you deduct from what you earn -- all kinds of 
earnings, dividend earnings, any kind.  <p> 
 
		You deduct right off the top what you invest and what 
you save. <p> 
 
		And we think it has got a great opportunity, and it got 
a lot of opportunity built into it.  <p> 
 
		We cannot sit here, Mr. Chairman and Members, and say 
it's as simple as the notion of a flat tax.  But we would also 
suggest this is not a notion or an idea.  We've given you a 
total, full Tax Code.  <p> 
 
		We are very cautious fellows.  We asked so many 
questions they finally said, "Well, let's just write the whole 
damn thing so you can answer every question."  <p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		Now, that has made it such that we are picked on, 
because now people say, "Oh, this is not so good, because we know 
this about it."  		But, you see, we don't know this and 
that and the other about the other proposals.  They may all be 
wonderful, and you'll look at them all.  And I hope you come up 
with the best.<p> 
 
		Thank you very much.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Ed Feulner has a comment he wanted he 
wanted to make.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FEULNER</b>:  Mr. Chairman, I just want to 
thank both Senators Domenici and Nunn for the leadership they've 
shown going back several years, when tax reform was not a very 
popular subject.  <p> 
 
		I sat in on some of those early meetings with our good 
friends at the Center for Strategic and International Studies as 
they assembled the group.  And you two really fought through some 
very, very serious battles.<p> 
 
		I don't have any questions, <p> 
 
Mr. Chairman, but I just applaud their leadership for many years 
in this area.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR DOMENICI</b>:  Thank you.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Shirley Peterson.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER PETERSON</b>:  I also applaud your efforts.  <p> 
 
		I have studied your proposal with great interest, and I 
think it's fantastic that you got out there early thinking about 
this.<p> 
 
		I have one quick question.  One of our principles is to 
simplify the law.  One of the difficulties that we have in our 
current system is that we have not been able to define "income" 
easily.  	<p> 
 
		I'm a little concerned that we might face the same 
difficulty in defining "savings."  What is your response to that?<p> 
 
		SENATOR DOMENICI:  Our general response is we would 
define "savings" now pretty much like you do an IRA.  It would be 
financial savings, but it would also include investment.  	 
	So, we would have a rather broad definition.  It would not 
include things that are not financial in nature, and it would not 
include -- unless they were used directly in a business, like 
land, if it was used in a business for an apartment building or 
something of that nature.  	<p> 
 
		It would not include works of art, it would not include 
gold bullion.  But it would include gold stocks.  It would have 
to be a financial investment.<p> 
 
		So, we try to track the current Code as much as 
possible.<p> 
 
		I'd like to just throw out one other thing.  You talk 
about simplicity.  I know Chairman Archer has talked about a 
sales tax.  <p> 
 
		One of the things that makes ours -- and some people 
critique it on that ground -- a little more complex than it would 
otherwise be is the fact we came to a conclusion, after about a 
year of looking at this, that you had to do something about old 
savings if you do something about -- if you go to a consumption-based tax.  Whether it's done at the retail 
level, whether it's a 
value-added, or whether it is like ours, at the income level.  <p> 
 
		If you don't do that, what you are basically doing -- 
let's say you levied a <p> 
 
20 cent sales tax and replaced the Income Tax Code, if somebody 
saved all their lives and got $100,000 in the bank, and they're 
now -- they've already paid taxes on that and they're about to 
start consuming it, you have just taken #20,000 from them.  <p> 
 
		You've taken 20 percent of their life earnings.  We had 
to struggle with this old savings, because ours -- now, most 
people save less than $50,000, and we think we've got that part 
of it taken care of very simply, because we let them deduct and 
amortize that $50,000 as new savings, in effect writing it off 
over three years.  <p> 
 
		Above that, it gets a little more complicated.  And I 
won't go into it today.  But I would call your attention to the 
fact when you go to a consumption-based tax, whatever form, 
you've got to do something about old savings, otherwise you are 
penalizing people who've already been taxed and who have saved, 
in the name of encouraging it for others.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  You have done us a great honor.  And, 
Pete and Sam, thank you so very much on behalf of the Commission.  
<p> 
 
		And we hope to call -- we hope to do this again 
sometime in September, October.   <p> 
 
		And I say to both of you, as we begin the inventory the 
solutions, that helping focus on the problem, that is very 
helpful.  Thank you.  We appreciate your taking the time.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR DOMENICI</b>:  Thank you.<p> 
 
		Mr. Chairman, might I just say --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Yes, of course.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR DOMENICI</b>:  I think you and your staff and all 
Members know that we did not put this together by ourselves.  So, 
there are experts in both the accounting field and from the 
business side --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Right.	<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR DOMENICI</b>:  -- and auditors that help put it 
together, that modeled it.  It has been modeled because we gave 
them certain instructions. <p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Good.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR DOMENICI</b>:  Your staff ought to know what those 
instructions were, because if you'd like different instructions, 
that will change the nature of it --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Right.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR DOMENICI</b>:  -- not the premises,  but the nature 
-- some of the specifics.  <p> 
 
		And that might make it more palatable to some of you or 
eliminate some of your questions.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Thank you.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR DOMENICI</b>:  Thank you very much.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  And thank all of you for taking your 
time.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Thanks, Sam.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  Thank you. <p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  The Honorable Richard Armey -- author, 
television star. <p> 
 
		Dick, thank you so very much.  I made a last-minute 
call to you as an old friend and asked you to appear.  <p> 
 
		We have been fascinated by the Armey flat tax.  We know 
the hard work you've put into it personally, your staff, the men 
and women behind it.  <p> 
 
		We've been listening to consumption and sales tax this 
morning.  We'd like to talk with you, as opposed to at you, and 
hear your view of the problems of the Tax Code and what led to 
the Armey flat tax that has gotten so much publicity around the 
country.  And thank you for being --<p>

applying for a 501(c)(3) <p> 
 
status --  	<p>

<center><b>REMARKS OF CONGRESSMAN <a name="Richard K. Armey">RICHARD K. ARMEY</a> </b></center> 
<p> 
 
<center><b>MAJORITY LEADER US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</b></center> 
<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Let me say, first of all, I 
appreciate all of you giving of your time and time and effort to 
deal with this issue.  It's going to be, I think, a very complex 
but very much a central part of the public policy debate for the 
next few years.<p> 
 
		You've already heard from people who advocate the Nunn-Domenici proposal, the sales 
tax.  And now you hear from me.  <p> 
 
		But I think one thing that you will see we have a 
universal agreement on is the current Tax Code as we know it is 
no longer acceptable to the American people.  <p> 
 
		And I thought I would talk this morning very briefly on 
two points:<p> 
 
		Why is it the American people are so discontent -- 
even, I would say, angry -- about the current Tax Code and the 
manner in which it is enforced?  <p> 
 
		And you don't have to travel very far in this country 
before you encounter the frustration, the anger, the anxiety that 
forebodes the average American taxpayer.  <p> 
 
		Clearly, the first complaint that you hear from the 
taxpayer is that it is too complex.  That complexity is felt 
individually by the individual as something ominous.  <p> 
 
		I file my own taxes.  I have always done my own taxes.  
I have a Ph.D. in economics.  I have a considerable number of -- 
graduate  training in accounting.  <p> 
 
		And I still find myself -- struggle as I may over every 
bit of detail in each one of these complex manuals and giving it 
my best shot, filing my taxes in full confidence that I have done 
my utmost to comply with the law -- living, then, for several 
months in some dread fear that I will have a knock on the door or 
an ominous letter in my mailbox explaining to me how it is that 
somehow I missed something, and am therefore presumed to have 
been guilty of cheating on my taxes.<p> 
 
		And I have to tell you, I may not be very bright, Mr. 
Chairman, but I am not crazy.  If I'm going to pick somebody to 
have a fight with on purpose, it will not be the IRS.<p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		So, I assure you I am as meticulous as I can be, and 
yet I can't be confident that I didn't make a mistake.<p> 
 
		And I think that kind of dread fear is something every 
American citizen lives with today.<p> 
 
		Now, the complexity has another dimension to it that is 
not perhaps so personal.  We spend $5.4 billion manhours in 
America every year complying with the Tax Code.  That's more 
time, more manhours than is spent in the production of every car, 
truck, and van produced in this country each year.<p> 
 
		That is $232 billion worth of compliance cost.  And 
insofar as that is more than is necessary, it is sheer deadweight 
loss and waste in the economy.  <p> 
 
		Each one of these manhours, each dollar of this $232 
billion could be put to some productive use, rather than to the 
deadweight loss use of simply complying with federally -- 
government-mandated red tape.  <p> 
 
		Waste is always counterproductive.  Waste always goes 
against growth, against efficiency, against standard of living, 
and it is never something that can be accepted or tolerated in 
any economy that works to allocate scarce and precious resources 
to their best alternative use.  And this I think is something 
that we need to understand.  <p> 
 
		And I think at some level the American people 
understand.  It is a waste.  <p> 
 
		People kid me about the flat tax.  "Will it be enacted 
into law?  If it is, what will -- how will we know?"  <p> 
 
		And I say, "Well, you will know because the sales of 
Rolaids will go down between January 1 and April 15th.<p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		And that is the sort of intuitive, <p> 
 
in-our-stomach understanding that "There's waste afoot here, and 
it's coming back to roost in my backyard."<p> 
 
		I should not spend two weekends and several evenings 
between January 1 and April 15th being short-tempered and 
insensitive and intolerant with my wife because she might have 
lost a receipt someplace --<p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		-- when, in fact, it was probably me in the first 
place.<p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		Or too busy to spend time with the children, because I 
got hung up -- the receipts.<p> 
 
		That's waste in a very personal way.<p> 
 
		Double-taxation is a very big part of the current Tax 
Code.  It is always incredible to me that somebody can look at 
this Tax Code and look at the rate structure and say it's fair, 
when in this Tax Code, we have billions of -- hundreds of 
billions of dollars that escape the tax base altogether, and then 
at the same time turn around and impose double-taxations on 
hundreds of billions of other dollars.  What can be more unfair 
than that?<p> 
 
		But that is particularly important when the double-taxation almost always and almost 
universally falls on savings 
and investment, which are the two engines of economic growth.<p> 
 
		Finally, people are aware of the fact that the high tax 
rates slow economic growth. 		And here is the shocking 
statistical revelation.  You'll find it on page 1 of my formal 
remarks, which I would ask you to put in the record.  	Despite 
all that we have done -- certainly the leadership shown by Jack 
Kemp in the early '80s to get rid of and lower high marginal 
rates -- by comparison with 1965, when fewer than 3 percent of 
American families filing joint reports had a marginal rate at or 
above <p> 
 
28 percent, today -- or in 1999 -- '91 -- in 1991, 36 percent of 
American families filing joint returns filed at a marginal rate 
at or above 28 percent.<p> 
 
		If there is anything, any single statistic that says to 
me Milton Friedman was right when he said "bracket creep" --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Right.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY:</b>  -- this is the statistic.  <p> 
 
		The fact of the matter is we are more beleaguered by 
the oppressive impact of high marginal rates on incentive to 
economic growth and individual initiative now than we were even 
before the high drama of the '80s and the tax reforms we 
attempted in the '80s.  <p> 
 
		And that translates into lost economic opportunity, 
lost growth.<p> 
 
		Finally, the American people think of the current Tax 
Code as unfair.  And that comes largely out of the complexity.  <p> 
 
		There is an abiding belief by almost every American 
taxpayer that "There's a break in the Code for everybody but me," 
or more breaks for others.<p> 
 
		(Sound of bell)<p> 
 
		That, ladies and gentlemen, is a bell that indicates I 
have a vote.  I would like to spend the next five minutes and 
complete my statement and then, if you will, I'll go vote.  And 
if you would like, I would then come back.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Oh, good.	<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  But I must make the vote.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Dick Gephardt has just walked in.  We 
want to hear him as well.<p> 
 
		Since -- did you say you were going to go right now?  <p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Well, I would like to finish my 
statement first.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Okay.  Please do.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  So that -- and I would say it is 
this heartfelt belief that this complex system that "has a break 
for everybody but me" us unfair.  <p> 
 
		And therefore you will see people who will say, 
"Therefore, I'll give myself a break."  		And that, in my 
estimation, is the fundamental cause of what we know as the 
underground economy -- not the criminal economy, but the 
underground economy, which is technically criminal, but criminal 
behavior but normally law-abiding men.  <p> 
 
		The plumber who says, "I'll do your job on Saturday if 
you pay me in cash, because I've got no break that this guy down 
the road has gotten.  I know he's got it.  Even though I can't 
find it, I know he's got it."<p> 
 
		And then secondly, because it's so complex and has 
seemed to be so unfair, that person who is tempted to the 
underground economy says, "And I can do that and get away with 
it. Because of all the hundreds of billions of data points that 
the IRS must keep track of, they'd never find this little 
Saturday morning data point anyway."<p> 
 
		So, if you feel self-justified in cutting a corner in 
such a way that you won't get caught, you will have a low 
resistance to the temptations of the underground economy.<p> 
 
		Now, as I examined these circumstances in the current 
Tax Code and said, "How do we fix this," I was brought to the 
flat tax.  And this is what I would suggest to you the flat tax 
has to offer if you will look at it.  <p> 
 
		First, it's simplicity.  That, of course, is 
exemplified by the single <p> 
 
postcard-size form.  <p> 
 
		You know, it is a very simple matter, and incidentally, 
I would say, honest and direct matter of just simply taking that 
income that you earned, deduct from that a generous family 
allowance, and apply a single rate to that which is in excess of 
that allowance.  <p> 
 
		You don't have to hunt up all those receipts for all 
that complex and mysterious itemized deductions.  <p> 
 
		You don't have to worry about what is the definition. <p> 
 
		You know, I have a very small annuity program from my 
old years as a college professor.  I get $144 a month for my 
retirement, which, of course, reminds me that tenure meets not 
having enough money forever.<p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		And every time I file my taxes, I've got to try to 
figure out if this is, in this line, at A or B, because I have to 
understand the definition -- legal definitions of that. <p> 
 
		It's fair.  You know, everybody gets treated the same.  
	<p> 
 
		And let me suggest to you that as you watch the 
political debate of the next two years in America on this issue 
of taxation and on other issues, you're going to see a great 
national debate on what is fair.<p> 
 
		And I will believe, from what I've seen just in the 
testimonies I've got regarding the flat tax, that America today, 
more than at any time in our history, is coming to the belief 
that what is fair is that this government treat everybody exactly 
the same as everybody else.  		And when people believe that 
they are being treated fairly, they have lost the temptation to 
give themselves the break that they didn't get relative to the 
other person.<p> 
 
		But more than any other thing I hear, it is fair.  It's 
simple, it's obvious, it's honest, it's fair.  And I like that.  
That's the typical American response.<p> 
 
		The flat tax promotes economic growth, I think, to as 
much a degree as you can with the Tax Code, and in a very few 
specific rates, which I'll be happy to discuss after I go vote.  		The low rates are real, especially the 
low marginal 
rate is real and indisputable and obvious.  <p> 
 
		Double-taxation is ended in the flat tax, so we no 
longer have a tax bias against savings and investment.  It is 
neutral.  <p> 
 
		Under the flat tax, people will make decisions to save, 
invest, or consume based upon their personal family financial or 
business economic circumstances and conditions and not cajoled by 
some bias in the Tax Code.<p> 
 
		And then, of course, the specific treatment of capital 
is very important.  We expense capital for economic growth in 
America in the end of this century and the beginning of the next 
century that will be so much centered in the high tech, 
communications, electronics, computerized sectors of the economy, 
where new technology we know brought on line today is likely to 
be obsolete in two years from now.  		You have an 
incentive to make that investment when you can expense it and 
recapture its cost, knowing that two years from now you can even 
get more in tune with the new modern future that you didn't even 
imagine two years ago.  <p> 
 
		So, this, I think, is an extremely important growth 
component for a critical sector of our future economy.<p> 
 
		Finally, let me say, before I leave and surrender the 
podium -- and I will come back if you like --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Thank you.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  -- the flat tax, in my estimation, 
is an important innovation, because public policy, in order to 
prevail in America, must be accepted by America.  <p> 
 
		And the American people have demonstrated that they 
love the simplicity, the honesty, the directness, the fairness of 
the flat tax.  <p> 
 
		And there is no public policy that can be more easily 
and more inexpensively and less intrusively administered than 
that which is accepted by the American people.  <p> 
 
		So, the deadweight loss I think will go away, along 
with the incentive for underground economy.<p> 
 
		And again, I'm --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Dick, thanks. <p> 
 
		You go vote, come back.<p> 
 
		We'll hear from Senator Mack, Chairman of the Joint 
Economic Committee.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Thank you.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Thank you, Dick.	<p> 
 
		(Pause)<p> 
 
		It is a personal honor and a great privilege to 
introduce the Chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, my friend 
Connie Mack, the Senator from Florida.<p> 
 
		I won't introduce you to all the Commissioners, Connie, 
but I know you know all of the men and women in one forum or 
another who are on the Commission.  <p> 
 
		We are inventorying the problems of the Code and the 
nexus between taxes and growth and the budget.  <p> 
 
		And with your interest in those three issues, we 
thought it would be particularly appropriate to have your 
leadership on this issue, and we'd like you to make some comments 
and then have a dialogue with the Commission.  It's not a 
hearing, per se.  <p> 
 
		It's a public -- our first public hearing, so to speak, 
on the problems of the Code as we begin to look forward to the 
solutions down the road.<p> 
 
		So, please take what time you would like, and allow us 
to have some questions.   And then Dick Armey and, I think, Dick 
Gephardt both said they'd come back and maybe sit on a panel.<p> 
 
		Thank you.

<center><b>REMARKS OF <a name="Connie Mack">SENATOR CONNIE MACK</a></b> </center> 
<p> 
 
<center><b>CHAIRMAN, JOINT ECONOMIC COMMITTEE</b></center> 
<p> 
 
		<b>SENIOR MACK</b>:  Well, first of all, I want to thank you, 
Jack, for the opportunity to participate this morning.<p> 
 
		And I want to express my deep appreciation for the 
members of the panel in taking the time that I know that I know 
that is requiring of you to engage yourself and involve yourself 
in what I think is one of the most significant issues that faces 
our Nation.<p> 
 
		As you hear from people today, you're probably going to 
hear more in the specifics with respect to the various aspects of 
tax reform than you're going to hear from me, because, frankly, I 
want to address the issue from a broader perspective.<p> 
 
		I believe that the primary objective -- the thing that 
ought to be on your mind as you work your way through a series of 
decisions about the future Tax Code, the number one priority, as 
far as I'm concerned, is what does it do to growth, what does it 
do to jobs creation, what does it do with respect to business 
formation, what does it do with respect to technology, how does 
it affect the flow of capital from old technologies to new 
technologies?<p> 
 
		So, the first and primary objective I think you ought 
to keep in your mind as you work through the issue of reform is 
what is this going to do to our ability as a Nation to grow and 
provide opportunities to all Americans.<p> 
 
		Allow me to, again, take a somewhat broader perspective 
on this issue.  	<p> 
 
		Again, in speaking about the issue of growth -- and I 
would tie it into this next seven years, the commitment that has 
been made and will be made in these next few days by the Congress 
to work our way towards a balanced budget in the year 2002.  <p> 
 
		Almost always you hear from people there are really 
only two ways to address the budget deficit issue.  They either 
say you've got to raise taxes, or you've got to cut spending in 
order to get there.  	<p> 
 
		Many of us have been trying to make the case that there 
is a third and -- I was going to say "equally important."  I 
would make the case "more important" method to address the issue 
of deficit reduction.  And that's growth in the economy.  	 
		<p> 
 
		So, I think what you're involved in is vital to the 
future of the Nation from the perspective of over the next seven 
years, if we're going to meet this target -- and I'm convinced 
that we will -- that the conclusions that you draw with respect 
to the decisions you make and the recommendations that you make 
to those of us who will be out making a campaign statement to the 
American people in 1996 -- again, I think it's going to be vital, 
what you develop, as to our ability both to meet that target of a 
balanced budget by 2002 and to provide hope and opportunity to 
all Americans.<p> 
 
		Let me add another perspective here.  Several years ago 
I read a book by Jacques Attile (phonetic) that enraged me, 
frankly.  And it was -- the book was called <i>Millennium</i>.<p> 
 
		And in the book, basically Jacques Attile lays out that 
America's time in the sun has past, that the American century is 
over, it's behind us, that the future belongs either to the 
Europeans, the French, and the Germans, or to the Asians, and 
that America's time has passed.<p> 
 
		Now, I must say I'm a fairly competitive person.  So, 
as I was reading through this book, I could find myself really 
getting angry about what I was -- what I was reading.  <p> 
 
		But I think at some point you have to stop and ask 
yourself, well, is there any possibility that the premise could 
be true.  	<p> 
 
		And if there is some possibility to ask ourselves the 
question, "Well, what do we need to do to remain the center of 
influence in the 21st century?" -- and the first thing you might 
say or first thing you might hear from others, is, "Well, what 
difference does it make?"<p> 
 
		Well, I think it makes a tremendous amount of 
difference.  The first, of course, is obvious, it's -- it will 
have a direct effect on our children and our grandchildren.  <p> 
 
		If we're the center of influence into the 21st century, 
it's fairly easy to draw the conclusion that we will be able to 
enhance the standard of living for our children and 
grandchildren.<p> 
 
		But I would make the case that it goes a lot deeper 
than that.  A great nation has to set itself on a course to 
achieve something greater than itself.  And I would claim that 
that the greatness that we want to try to accomplish in the 21st 
century and the reason that we want to remain the center of 
influence is because I am convinced our Nation is the only nation 
on the globe that has the right kinds of policies, the belief in 
freedom and justice and democracy and human rights and 
capitalism.	<p> 
 
		And we are the only nation in the world, I believe, 
that is committed to exporting those ideas and those principles 
around the globe.<p> 
 
		So, again, I say to you, what you're engaged in I think 
is vital to the future.  It will, in fact, enable America to be 
the center of influence.  We will be able to export those ideas 
of freedom and justice and capitalism.<p> 
 
		And some people will respond and say, "Wait a minute, 
you know, I don't buy, you know, that kind of moral argument that 
you're making.  I'm more interested in "What can I do for the 
folks back home in my district?"	<p> 
 
		I would make the argument out of this that if, in fact, 
we are able to export those principles, that have made this 
Nation great, think of the huge markets that will have been 
created around the world in which our sons and daughters will 
have an opportunity to produce and sell in.<p> 
 
		So, I think there is a tremendous motivation behind 
what you're involved in.  And again, I commend you for the effort 
that you're making and your willingness to spend the time to be 
involved in this, what I think is a great cause.<p> 
 
		Now, let me go on to another point of this.  In 
essence, what do we have to do then?  I mean, how do we approach 
this issue of how we remain the center of influence?  <p> 
 
		Well, it's obvious the first thing that comes to my 
mind is that we have to be in a situation where we protect our 
basic civil liberties, and we enhance the capitalism that has 
made us great.<p> 
 
		And how do we do that?  Well, I think we need to listen 
to some of those who have been talking about the future.  <p> 
 
		Several weeks ago, I held a hearing of the Joint 
Economic Committee on "Economic Policy in the 21st Century."  <p> 
 
		And one of the individuals that I had at the hearing 
was Alvin Toffler.  Toffler -- everybody kind of hears Toffler 
talk about the <p> 
 
-- how we have moved from a hunting and gathering society through 
agriculture, through industrial -- into the information 
communications age.  <p> 
 
		But if you focus on that, I think you've missed the 
message.  What Alvin Toffler really says, from an economic 
perspective, is that you've got to look beyond the old factors of 
production of land, labor, and capital, because there, in fact, 
is another element today.  That element totally changes the 
future.  And that element is knowledge.  <p> 
 
		I mean, production in the future and our ability to 
produce and grow and remain the center of influence is going to 
come from adding to those basic factors that we term "knowledge."<p> 
 
		I think that when you accept that additional factor, it 
explodes the myth of scarcity, which leads me to another 
individual that I would say that my dear friend Jack Kemp focused 
me on, probably now six years ago, when George Guilder came out 
with his book called <i>Microcosm</i>.  It is a history of the 
microchip, the history of the computer.  	<p> 
 
		And he makes many of the same points.  I'd like to take 
just a moment though and -- Guilder says, "The central event of 
the 20th century is the overthrow of matter.  The powers of mind 
are everywhere ascending over the brute force of things."<p> 
 
		And, in essence, what he is arguing is that economics 
is going to move away from a study of scarcity to the allocation 
of abundance.  <p> 
 
		Now, the problem that I think that we're dealing with 
is that we find ourselves kind of boxed in to an old way of 
thinking.  I mean, this is a new world, it is a new age.  And 
there are new opportunities, and we have to develop new ways of 
looking at those opportunities.<p> 
 
		I was struck this weekend as I read through David 
Broder's article in the <i>Washington Post</i> that was entitled "The 
Democrat Divide."  And it quotes a Michael Rothschild, a 
San Francisco futurist.  He sets forth the proposition that the 
microchip revolution is ushering in a new era of abundance, 
vanquishing scarcity to the dustbin of history.<p> 
 
		And so, again, I think it is important for us to 
understand that we are, in fact, moving into a new age.  And 
we've got to get out of the thinking of economic policy that 
basically was developed with mass production, mass communication, 
mass everything.<p> 
 
		Well, today we know that there are niche markets.  We 
know that computers are used to both design and define what those 
markets are.  	<p> 
 
		And so we have to come up with economic policies that 
reflect this new age.<p> 
 
		Now, we're going to have quite a debate, and you're 
going to be involved in a whole series of choices that you're 
going to have to go through about how to put together a Tax Code 
for the 21st century.  <p> 
 
		I took this opportunity to develop a list of 10 
principles for the tax system for the 21st century, and I'll 
leave this -- I'm not going to go through it at this point, with 
the exception of maybe picking out just two.<p> 
 
		I think again, thinking from the perspective that 
growth is what we want to try to accomplish with a Tax Code, you 
have to ask yourself the question "What single thing can you do 
that will affect growth more than anything else?"  <p> 
 
		I think it's the lowest possible marginal tax rate that 
you can come up with, because I believe that if you lower the 
marginal tax rate, that you, in fact, will provide the incentive 
-- you will give people encouragement.  		You will say to 
them that "There is a reward for your work, for your savings, for 
your investing."  It is clearly the way to release and encourage 
the American spirit of innovation.<p> 
 
		So, the lowest possible marginal tax rate I think has 
got to be on the top of the list.<p> 
 
		The second point that I would make is I think whatever 
plan or program that you come up with, it should be neutral.  <p> 
 
		I hear a lot of my colleagues saying -- and it began 
back when we had the debates in 1986 about tax reform.  You know, 
there was a lot of talk about we need to punish consumption.  		Well, you know, I am not an 
economist, but I have -- I 
have listened to a number of economists over the years.  I don't 
recall seeing an economic equation that said that you can enhance 
growth by punishing consumption.<p> 
 
		Now, I want to encourage savings and investing, but 
what I'm saying to you is I think that you can encourage savings 
and investing without punishing consumption.  Because if I 
remember correctly, consumption plus investment equals what, 
income? <p> 
 
		So, what I'm saying is that, again, I think you need to 
try to work towards a Tax Code that, in fact, both encourages 
savings and investing and does so without punishing consumption.  
And I think that that can be done.<p> 
 
		Lastly, let me just make several other points.  And 
then I'll stop and try to respond to whatever questions you all 
have.<p> 
 
		One of the issues we're going deal with -- and we hear 
it day after day after day, by my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle, is this pitting Americans against each other, trying 
to pit one group of Americans against another group, one class 
versus another class, or creating the concept that there, in 
fact, is a class in our society.<p> 
 
		And I would say, if you look at some of the data that 
the Joint Economic Committee over the years has produced with 
respect to income distribution, really the way we ought to be 
talking about it is "income mobility," because there is true 
income mobility in our society, probably unlike any other society 
in the world.<p> 
 
		Just a couple of quick statistics:  From 1979 to 1988, 
86 percent of the wage earners in the lowest percentile, 20 
percentile of the country, 86 percent moved up into a higher 
percentile, 86 percent.<p> 
 
		You had a greater probability that you would go to the 
top 20 percentile than remaining in the 20 percentile.  Now, I 
think that's rather significant.  <p> 
 
		And we need to drive that message home, because if we 
get caught into this trap that there is some kind of a static 
model that we have to live with, then you're just in a situation 
you're trying to pit one group of winners and losers against the 
other, and I think that would be a tragedy.<p> 
 
		And the other point that I would make is that -- again, 
from the statistical data that was developed -- is that 52 
percent -- almost <p> 
 
53 percent of the people were in the top 20 -- or, excuse me, the 
top 1 percent in 1979 -- 52 percent of them fell into lower 
categories during those periods.  <p> 
 
		So, it's not just -- the point in all of this is that 
there is constant motion, that, in fact, if you provide people 
with incentive, they're going to move.  <p> 
 
		And that's where I come back again to:  The lowest 
marginal tax rate provides the greatest incentive.	    <p> 
 
		I guess I could go on and on, <p> 
 
Mr. Chairman, but I think the last point that I would make would 
be with respect to capital gains.  And I know capital gains has 
been talked about by economists in many different ways.  <p> 
 
		And frankly, this is a thought that I picked up in 
discussions with my friend Congressman Armey.<p> 
 
		If you think about capital gains as being a voluntary 
tax, which it, in essence, is -- if you think the tax rate is too 
high, you just voluntarily say, "I'm going to keep my money,  I'm 
not going to give it to the government, and you don't sell."<p> 
 
		But as a result of that, capital gains has become, if 
you will, a barrier or a wall that has been built around the 
investments that have taken place in the past, in the old 
technologies of the past.<p> 
 
		And what we want to do is we want to rip down those 
walls, and we want to let that capital flow into the new 
technologies.  That's where America's future is.<p> 
 
		So, again, I close with my comments, but again 
commending both Chairman Kemp and for -- and to all of you for 
your involvement in this.  I think it is a great endeavor, and I 
look for forward to seeing the product of what you produce.<p> 
 
		Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Well, Senator, we've been sitting here 
since 10 o'clock this morning, and we've heard some eloquent 
testimony.  <p> 
 
		But that -- I know I speak for all the Commissioners 
when I say that came from not only the head but the heart.  <p> 
 
		And I've heard you speak many times -- this is an 
editorial comment, and I know I speak for Carroll, with whom we 
all served together -- I have never heard you in finer form with 
regard to your vision of America in the 21st century.  	 
	And I know that's what Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich wanted us 
to do, is to put together, on a tabula rasa, a clean slate, a <p> 
 
Tax Code for the 21st century.  <p> 
 
		And you have helped set the predicate for that, 
reminded us that the ultimate wealth is not what's in the ground, 
it's what is in the heart and mind of the American people.  <p> 
 
		And I just really can't pass up the opportunity to say 
to you just thanks for the keynote address of this Commission.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR MACK</b>:  Thank you.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Shirley Peterson, former Commissioner 
of the IRS and an old friend of yours, I know.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER PETERSON</b>:  Senator Mack, thank you very 
much.  <p> 
 
		I find your statement very provocative and eloquent.  <p> 
 
		And I must say that one point that you made has really 
captured my imagination, and that is the issue -- the point of 
thinking about knowledge as part of the capital of this country 
and trying to design some way to encourage its growth, shall we 
say.  <p> 
 
		Because in addition to accomplishing all of the goals 
and principles that you set out, certainly it would increase the 
income mobility, it would create all the incentive, all the 
opportunity, all the hope that America stands for.  <p> 
 
		So, I am just excited by that suggestion.  And we will 
try to design some way to build that into our new system.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR MACK</b>:  Thank you.	<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN</b>:  (Inaudible)<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Herman Cain has a --		 
<b>COMMISSIONER PETERSON</b>:  (Inaudible) here.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  I'm sorry, Herman Cain has a question.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN</b>:  Thank you for coming, Senator Mack.  
It's good to see you.  <p> 
 
		And because I have the advantage of knowing your 
previous life, before you became a distinguished Senator here in 
Washington, and when you talked about your reaction in reading 
the <i>Millennium</i>, it triggered a disturbing statement that an early 
century economist by the name of Joseph Shumpter (phonetic) made.  
He said the greatest threat to capitalism is not its failure, but 
its success.  		<p> 
 
		And that has disturbed me, much as your observation 
with respect to the <i>Millennium</i>.  And when you think about that -- 
and that may be where we are -- we are at that crest of success, 
and that's what we are dealing with, and the fact that when you 
talk about capitalism and the use of capitalism, you are talking 
about businesses and business people using that to create the 
productivity that you've talked about.<p> 
 
		My question would be:  What are your thoughts about 
business leaders and businesspeople and the business community, 
since you have a relatively recent involvement directly as a 
business person; and now having been in Washington for a number 
of years, what are your thoughts in terms of how will businesses 
embrace radical change, revolutionary change, in terms of how we 
collect revenue from businesses, not necessarily the individual 
income tax side?<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR MACK</b>:  That's a difficult question, frankly, to 
respond to, because there are so many facets of business, so many 
-- we're going to have businesses who are, in essence, moving 
into the 21st century.  There are going to be businesses that 
initially will feel threatened as a result of change.<p> 
 
		I would say to them that they should encourage this 
change, because frankly it will open up to them the same 
opportunities that I see for individuals.  <p> 
 
		And what I'm referring to there is that I can remember 
-- again historically -- and I think we've all recognized this.  <p> 
 
		As we have moved move from an agricultural-based 
society to an industrial-based society, the agriculture community 
was worried about, well, if the Congress and the country is going 
to be facing on this new industrial age, what's going to happen 
to us?  <p> 
 
		Well, the reality is that what the farmers of America 
did is they finally embraced the new age, the industrial age, and 
they used those technologies to enhance their production, their 
capability.<p> 
 
		So, what I'm saying to you is that while we're going to 
hear, I think, some concerns from what some would refer to as <p> 
 
second-wave industries, whether that be the automobile industry 
in Detroit, which I just recently visited -- and it's really 
amazing to see what the automobile industry is doing with the 
development of the new -- use of new technologies. <p> 
 
		So, I think, again, what we ought to try to focus on, 
in addition to the lower marginal rates that I talked about, is 
what can we do to encourage the flow of capital that will allow 
these new technologies to move into the old industries, to 
enhance their ability to compete internationally.  <p> 
 
		And I guess that would be another point that's obvious 
to everybody.  We are so much, today, engaged in -- in 
international competition that what we have to do is enhance our 
businesses' abilities to compete.  <p> 
 
		And I think -- if I can make one, maybe one last point 
in this, last year a fellow by the name of George Hatsophilos 
(phonetic) came and testified or spoke with a group of Senators 
that Senator Packwood and Senator Domenici had put together.  <p> 
 
		And he had indicated that as a young man from Greece, 
he had looked all throughout the world to find what land provided 
the greatest opportunity for entrepreneurism.  And he chose 
America.<p> 
 
		And what we want to do with our Tax Code is to make 
sure that the next generation of George Hatsophiloses who look 
for entrepreneur capital of the world still believe that America 
is that capital.  <p> 
 
		And I think we can do that again with the kinds of 
reforms that you all are going to be looking at with respect to 
the Tax Code.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  All growth in an economy is the result 
of risk-taking men and women who are willing to take the fruits 
of their labor and put it at risk on a new idea and go through 
the vicissitudes and vagaries in competition of the marketplace.  <p> 
 
		And you have reminded us today that consumption is the 
reward for production and savings is consumption deferred.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR MACK</b>:  Absolutely.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  And your testimony is just absolutely 
laser-like in reminding this Commission that -- all of us, as 
Americans, the stake we have in setting the marginal tax rate in 
peacetime at the level of equilibrium at which people are willing 
to maximize their output and still pay that fundamental tax.<p> 
 
		I don't know where it is, but from Biblical times to 
today, there is empirical evidence -- I know I'm not supposed to 
come the any conclusions, because I've got a hat on now as a 
chairman -- but I have said many, many times, in my study of 
history, that the level of equilibrium is in the 20s, not the 40s 
and 50s, where we are today, you know..<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Ed Feulner.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FEULNER</b>:  I, too, want to thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.  	<p> 
 
		Two prefatory comments, if I may. <p> 
 
		First, I commend you for what you're doing with the 
Joint Economic Committee, in terms of the educational efforts.  <p> 
 
		I caught, on C-SPAN, your discussion with June O'Neill, 
the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, trying to make 
sense out of some very arcane number debates.  And it was very 
enlightening for me, who thought I knew a lot about some of these 
related subjects, because I learned a lot.<p> 
 
		Secondly, I know I speak for everybody on the 
Commission when I say we look forward to seeing your whole list 
of 10 principles, because I sure agree with the first three I 
heard.<p> 
 
		You were in the House, I think, at the time of the '86 
tax reform.  Chairman Archer, when he was here this morning, 
made, I think, a very telling point.  And that is that was 
supposed to be a simplifying, flattening, fairing kind of 
approach to tax reform.  It didn't work.	<p> 
 
		Subsequent to that, we have had two major tax 
increases, each of them, in effect, the largest tax increases 
we've had in our history, both as a result of the '91 budget deal 
and the tax increase of 1993.  <p> 
 
		What went wrong and how do we avoid that again, if, in 
fact, we are able to come in with some proposals that the 
Congress then accepts in terms of moving toward a fairer, flatter 
tax system?<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR MACK</b>;  Yes, that's a question, frankly, that 
has gone through my mind several times.  <p> 
 
		And those of us who have gone through this process, 
probably at the end of it -- I know one of the conclusions that I 
came to was why should we be surprised at what came out of 1986?  
I mean, that's -- the process was the same.  The interests were 
basically the same.  		"Why should we expect anything 
different?" is really the question that you're asking.<p> 
 
		The conclusion that I have come to is because we're 
different.  The Congress is different.  <p> 
 
		There was an incredible message that was sent by the 
people of this country in 1994.  I mean, it's amazing to listen 
to the people here in Washington, D.C., the things that they're 
saying to us -- like, you know, we should have been doing this a 
long time ago.  <p> 
 
		So, what I'm saying to you is I think the people who 
make up the Congress today are totally different.  We have a 
different way of looking at the process.  Lots of us want to 
change the process.  <p> 
 
		So, I guess what I'm saying to you is I think, Ed, that 
this is occurring just at the right time.<p> 
 
		And then the point -- the last point that I would make 
is:  There are some -- and Senator Packwood may have indicated 
this -- was he here earlier?<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  No, Senator Packwood, incidentally, to 
my colleagues, had to cancel because of the governors who are 
meeting over in the Senate.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR MACK</b>:  Okay.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  So, he will not be here.  So --<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR MACK</b>:  If Senator Packwood were here, he 
probably would say to you what he has said to me.  He thinks that 
the momentum in the country has built to the point where there's 
a chance that we could pass tax reform next year.  		Well, 
I must say to you, I don't think we're quite to that point.  But 
here is the thing -- and this is how I would like to see all of 
this play out -- is that you do your work and develop a proposal, 
hopefully, that would be embraced by the Republican -- at least 
the Republican members of the Congress.  <p> 
 
		I would love to see the Republican standard-bearer in 
1996 take it as the cause, as the contract, if you will.  Boy, 
what a change in America's attitude.  <p> 
 
		There was a contract offered in 1994.  The American 
people said, "We support that.  We want you to go back to 
Washington.  We came back, and we're doing it."<p> 
 
		And I think if we go to the American people in 1996 
with a new contract about tax reform, with low marginal tax 
rates, offering hope and opportunity, you elect us, we'll go back 
to Washington in 1997, and we'll pass true tax reform.  I think 
we, in fact, can do it.  It's a different Congress.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Ken Blackwell.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER BLACKWELL</b>:  Senator Mack, I would like to 
join the chorus of thanks for your clarity and for your vision.  <p> 
 
		If the objective of good tax policy is to minimize -- 
excuse me, maximize economic growth and the rising real incomes 
and real tax receipts that go along with that economic growth, 
then the most efficient tax rate on capital gains is zero.<p> 
 
		Have things changed so radically in Washington and in 
Congress that we can expect that folks will rise above the 
political hurdle and deal with that, that reality?     	 
	<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR MACK</b>:  My reaction is yes.  		Assuming 
that the premise that I gave earlier with respect to income 
mobility is correct -- and I've heard the Chairman many times 
refer to presidential candidate McGovern, who offered a tax 
proposal to the country which was just flat rejected.  And the 
reason it was rejected, people said, "Look, I hope to be rich 
some day."<p> 
 
		I mean, there is a belief in this nation, and it is 
built on fact.  It's built on the stories that all of us hear 
from people all across this Nation, of all ages, all colors, who 
basically say, "Give me the opportunity and I'll succeed, and 
I'll move up."  <p> 
 
		So, if the premise is right and people understand that 
capital formation is key to our competitive advantage and to 
providing us with the tools to compete, then they're going to 
support it, because they know in the long run it is in their best 
interests to do so.  <p> 
 
		But, again, we can't be faint-hearted about making the 
-- providing the message.  I mean, I -- every time I talk about 
capital gains -- and I've done it now since 13 years that I've 
been involved in the Congress -- every time I do it, you know, 
somebody wants to make a charge that, "You know, Mack is just 
interested in the wealthy."<p> 
 
		Well, if we're going to let that charge deny us from 
making the claim about what the future is all about and what 
eliminating the tax on capital gains would do and the 
opportunities it would provide, if we're going to -- we might as 
well get out of the arena.    <p> 
 
		But I think we have a case to make.  In fact -- <p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Your explanation that the capital gains 
tax is, in essence, a transaction tax, it's a voluntary tax.  If 
you don't transact or sell anything, you don't pay it.  The only 
people who have to pay it are middle-income working men and women 
who want to save to send their children to college.  <p> 
 
		And so it ends up that the capital gains tax is not a 
tax on the rich, it's a tax <p> 
 
-- they're already rich.  They're going to get rich under any 
system.  It's a tax on the poor, who really want to get rich.  
And that's the essence of this dynamics fluidity that you have 
alluded to.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR MACK</b>:  There are some statistical --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  I think -- Matt -- John -- Dean -- 
Carroll -- Carroll had a question, Carroll Campbell.<p> 
 
		We've got Dick Armey waiting in the wings again, so we 
want to -- <p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAMPBELL</b>:  Senator, I think your point is 
right -- right, absolutely, on target when you talk about capital 
gains.  		There's no question that you discourage the 
investment with the tax; no question that people lock up their 
investment and sit on it.  There's no question that it hurts the 
flow of capital, and it has to be corrected.  	<p> 
 
		And I speak to this strictly from experience.  We, in 
the state of South Carolina, reformed the entire Tax Code, and we 
cut the capital gains tax, and we cut a lot of other rates.  And 
everybody said, "Well, we will go broke."<p> 
 
		It was just the opposite.  I just talked to my 
successor this last weekend.  And he said, "You're not going to 
believe it."  He said, "We had a $600 million surplus this year."  
And he cut the rates again.  <p> 
 
		That was an interesting -- it's an interesting thing.  
I don't think that people understand it.  	<p> 
 
		The point I'm getting to is we've got to get across to 
the American people that a capital gains tax cut is not for the 
wealthy, it's not for the rich.  It creates jobs, it unlocks 
capital, and it creates wealth in this country.  <p> 
 
		And we have suffered for years every time we raise the 
term "capital gains reduction" or "eliminate the tax," that all 
this is something for the rich.<p> 
 
		The best example that was ever given to me was a lady 
that started a small beauty shop, worked in it for years and 
years, and wanted to sell it.  And she found out that she was 
going to have to pay the tax on it, and the appreciation of that 
little piece of property.  The compounding up really had caused 
her to sit down and put pencil to paper.  And she found out that 
she really wasn't going to make anything out of it if she sold 
it.<p> 
 
		And she explained that to me in very simple terms.  And 
I think that's what has got to be explained to the American 
people.  <p> 
 
		But that's what's happening to us in our economy.  And 
I really appreciate what you've had to say to us.  I think you're 
very eloquent, and I hope a lot of people listen.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Good.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR MACK</b>:  Thank you.  Thank you, sir. <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Jack Faris wants to start off -- of 
NFIB.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Jack.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FARIS</b>:  Mr. Leader, thank you for being 
here, and for going back and forth and making the votes.	<p> 
 
		Business owners, especially small business owners, feel 
like that they're -- they've become more tax collectors for the 
government than they have entrepreneurs.  Many of them would 
never start if they knew the threats that they would have to 
being in business. 	<p> 
 
		We've heard from everyone today saying that "We want to 
sponsor growth and new job creation."  <p> 
 
		We know that basically happens on Main Street today.<p> 
 
		What is in your plan and proposal that takes -- that 
gives some relief to the small business owner who is chief cook, 
bottle-washer, accountant, everything, within the company, the 
business that they have, but wants to make life easier and more 
simple for them as the government's number one tax collector?<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Well, Jack, I welcome that 
question.  And incidentally, I might mention I have an article 
that is coming out in <i>Policy Review</i> in the July issue that 
addresses the whole question of a national sales tax, because 
here I think is where the small business owner, particularly the 
retail merchant in America, really falls into harm's way with 
respect to this obligation of being tax collector for the state 
and making a life very complex and threatened.<p> 
 
		It is my contention that under a national sales tax the 
IRS will have a more complex job than it has today.  It will 
become a bigger agency, and it will become a more aggressive 
agency as they walk into every retail store in America, ask to 
check your inventories, check your sales receipts, check your 
purchase orders, and "Let me see if you're doing my job good 
enough to suit me."  And I think that's going to be a terrible 
experience.<p> 
 
		The flat tax says, to the small business owner, "You 
can take your inventory expenses at the time of purchase.  You 
can take your investment expenses at the time of purchase."  <p> 
 
		You have, then, in terms of the complexities of your 
Tax Code, two items of relief in terms of how you handle 
inventory and how you handle capital investment.<p> 
 
		We will allow you to deduct any normal necessary 
business expense.  And after you deduct that expense and reduce 
yourself to your net earnings, you pay a simple flat rate, which 
is the same rate that we apply to anything.  <p> 
 
		And the important thing about the flat tax, as I 
envision it, is that you capture every dollar of income earned in 
the Nation and tax it one time with a single flat rate, whether 
it be earned through business enterprise or through individual 
enterprise.  <p> 
 
		And, of course, that can only apply to net earnings.  <p> 
 
		I believe the complexity of the Code, as faced by the 
small business, will be less than it is today.  Unfortunately, we 
can find no way to give any business enterprise a code that will 
be as simple as that for the individual.  <p> 
 
		The business owner may, as we work out -- and I might 
say, by the way, we do have a team of people that are working on 
transition rules, and I think the transition rules must be 
premeditated.  They can't be worked out at the <p> 
 
11th hour.  <p> 
 
		They've got to be thought out, because if you read <i>The 
Showdown in Gucci Gulch</i>, you'll find out the transition rules is 
where all the mystery was done in '86.<p> 
 
		But as we examine that, one of the things we have to 
focus our attention on is the peculiarities of transitioning for 
-- especially the small business.<p> 
 
		(Pause)<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Dean Kleckner was the next, and then --	<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER KLECKNER</b>:  Mr. Armey, I'm a farmer from 
Iowa, president of the Farm Bureau.  I also on the National 
Economic Commission with Senator Domenici back in -- seven years 
ago, in '87, '88.  <p> 
 
		We were established at that time to be a cover for a 
tax increase, which we didn't recommend, kind of shocked some 
people.  But I think most commissions -- although we're not an 
official government commission like the NEC was -- are put in as 
a cover to do something.<p> 
 
		Have things changed?  That's my first question.  Have 
things changed today in the country that commissions and groups, 
study groups, that you're really interested in what we say?  Or 
is it predetermined and that we're in general a cover for 
something?<p> 
 
		The second one -- more direct, a follow-up with Jack 
Faris' question, and Ken Blackwell's earlier -- I guess where you 
came back on capital gains tax.  Farmers are -- have tremendous 
value in the increases in value, largely inflation increases.		<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Right.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Right.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER KLECKNER</b>:  How will -- and farmers aren't 
be sold today as a result of that, so the government -- 28 
percent of nothing is less than 14 percent of something would be.  
		But how will the capital gains increase when tremendous 
values of farmland are sold, and triple probably or quadruple 
values are then accumulated from when they were bought 30 years 
ago?  <p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Let me first talk about cover.  We 
have at least three -- well, four -- at least four very good tax 
proposals that are being talked about in the Nation today, the 
Nunn-Domenici proposal, Bill Archer's emphasis on the national 
sales tax, my own iteration of the flat tax, and then we have 
Senator Specter with a different iteration of the flat tax.  
These are complex and difficult issues.<p> 
 
		In my judgment, nobody that advances these issues feels 
any qualms about the standing of their personal political 
popularity with America.  I can tell you I don't need any cover.  
I'm afraid that somebody in America may not notice that I should 
credit for the flat tax.<p> 
 
		So, I mean, certainly there's nobody seeking cover in 
this venture.  But I do think the Majority Leader of the Senate 
and Speaker of the House said these are complex ideas, they're 
all good ideas.  How do we sort through these ideas?  <p> 
 
		And we need to find people that have a proven, 
demonstrated expertise, background, and understanding that will 
have the time and the ability to sort through these ideas and 
make us a recommendation.  <p> 
 
		I don't consider that the search for cover as much as I 
see that as the search for a rational decision-making process.  
The fact of the matter is the Speaker is a very busy person.  The 
Majority Leader of the Senate is a very busy person.  <p> 
 
		The complexity, as you will learn, is so varied and 
diversified, they need your advice.<p> 
 
		Capital gains -- if I -- and let me just say, if I were 
-- this is going to be a fun statement.  I'll only get to say 
this once in my life.  If I were a farmer in Iowa, I would love 
Dick Armey.  And why do I say that?<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Are you running for something?	<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  No. I'm just saying that -- I think 
there are one or two farmers in Iowa that don't love Dick Armey.  
(Laughter)<p> 
 
		But still -- but in terms of tax reform and the flat 
tax, capital gains gets treated properly.  It's zero capital 
gains.<p> 
 
		We have a nomenclature with respect to capital gains 
today that I find personally difficult.  <p> 
 
		We talk about reducing the capital gains tax rate.  And 
inevitably somebody will talk about a preferential capital gains 
tax rate, and that just burns me up, because what, in fact, we're 
talking about is a less prejudicial capital gains tax rate.  <p> 
 
		Without basis adjustment for inflation, we have people 
paying capital gains taxes on capital losses.  <p> 
 
		And -- I think Carrol Campbell just related a story -- 
the fact of the matter is we zero capital gains, and that 
provides an enormous confidence that I can make an investment, 
take the risk.  And if it proves out and I have success, I can 
realize the benefits of that success.<p> 
 
		The other thing that I think is and should be of 
particular interest to the American farmer is the inheritance 
tax.  We do away with it.  My own view is that the federal 
government of the United States should not be the world's largest 
grave robber. <p> 
 
		But if you think of a farm family, you struggle in that 
farm, you work and you work and you build maybe some value, and 
maybe it accumulates over the years, and you manage to eke out a 
living on the farm and you've taken your son and your daughter, 
and you've sent them to school, and every year of your life you 
just got by, by putting another maintenance job on the old car, 
and so on down the line.  <p> 
 
		And then all of a sudden on one day you die, and those 
children of yours get assaulted by the government because they're 
king for a day.  <p> 
 
		On one day, the day of my death, my kids get to be 
rich, and the government comes and takes half of it away from 
them.  That's very little incentive.  <p> 
 
		And I have to tell you, if I'm given the choice between 
working for the financial well-being of the federal government 
and that of my children, I'll work a lot harder for the financial 
well-being of my children, and I'll build more and I'll build 
bigger, and I'll build more successful because of my children.<p> 
 
		Capital gains is another case where you're king for a 
day.  You just barely made a living off the farm for 30 years and 
then you sell the farm, and all of a sudden, you find yourself in 
the upper 1 percent of the income strata and somebody to be 
disdained, right?   And then we take it away.  <p> 
 
		And then, whatever you've got left after the government 
has taken their capital gains hit on you is what you've got to 
live off for the rest of your life when you go back to being a 
poor boy, you know.<p> 
 
		And these treatments I think are abusive and, quite 
frankly, not only -- it's a typical case of adding insult to 
injury.   <p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  They've heard about you in California, 
too.  Matt Fong has a question -- State Treasurer of California.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FONG</b>:  Earlier, before you made your 
presentation, we heard from Chairman Archer and Senator Nunn.  
Both focused on one element, saying that it's very important for 
this new tax policy to have notice to address the issue of the 
global economy.<p> 
 
		What I found interesting, <p> 
 
Chairman Archer professed that he was originally, some time ago, 
before, in favor of the flat tax, but now stated that he did not 
think that the flat tax properly addressed the global economy.<p> 
 
		And Senator Nunn talked us through a very quick example 
of how the value-added tax gave a European -- and he used the 
example, a European manufacturer -- a competitive advantage over, 
say, an American manufacturer who has to incorporate his income 
tax into his price overseas.  <p> 
 
		So, can you address that issue?<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Yes.  And this is a serious issue, 
and I've tried to give it serious thought, the question of border 
adjustability.  <p> 
 
		I take a generalized lesson about economics and public 
policy in this, that if you want to correct something, you don't 
do it by distorting the price system.  <p> 
 
		I think you can apply that principle to rent subsidies, 
or you can apply to agriculture policy.  You can apply it in any 
number of different ways.<p> 
 
		But what you're doing with these various forms of 
border adjustment is essentially you're dumping in the 
international tax market through the Tax Code by saying to 
foreign purchasers, "You can by American-made products at a lower 
price than what American purchasers buy."  <p> 
 
		I, frankly, don't think that's particularly fair to the 
American consumer.  <p> 
 
		And I am admonished by Adam Smith to remember that the 
ultimate end of economic activity is consumption, and to the 
effect that the government intervene in the affairs of the 
economy, it should do so on behalf of the consumer, not the 
producer.<p> 
 
		So, my own standard, it doesn't meet the public policy 
test of what is the national interest.<p> 
 
		So, I have these reservations about it. But I think -- 
more importantly, I don't think it will work.  I don't think 
you're going to correct an imbalance of trade.  <p> 
 
		As long as a nation remains dependent upon 
international capital sources to finance their investment, you're 
going to have to have a deficit in the current account in order 
to have a surplus in the capital account.<p> 
 
		Now, what does capital gains do -- or, I'm sorry, what 
does the flat tax do?  T<p> 
 
		The flat tax liberates American saving and investment 
for American investment, makes us less dependent upon foreign 
investment, and allows, then, the natural increased productivity 
and efficiency of a growing American economy to set straight this 
balance of trade.  <p> 
 
		But that becomes, then, another dilemma, because 
economies that grow faster will always have trade deficits with 
economies that grow slower.  And so you're blessing becomes your 
curse.<p> 
 
		Now, the thing that I think we ought to finally end up 
with, looking at this, while we bother ourself -- first of all, I 
believe governments have an inherent ability to bother themselves 
with things that are none of their own business.  <p> 
 
		Their lack of restraint is that they are fundamentally 
an institution that exists for the purpose of tending to other 
people's business, and they don't have any sense of discipline 
about it.  <p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		But international trade transactions are not 
transactions between governments.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  That's right.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  They're transactions between 
people.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Absolutely.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  So, why should the federal 
government --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Right on.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  -- tip the terms of trade against 
the American citizens?<p> 
 
		So, it strikes me that it is a misguided policy and one 
that is not likely to work out very well in the first place.<p> 
 
		And I frankly, because of this, have very little 
obsessive concern about border adjustability except insofar as I 
have some fear that somebody will actually bite on it and enact 
it.	<p> 
 
		I probably have said more than a prudent man should.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  No.  This is so important, and all of 
us are sitting up here nodding our heads when you said that trade 
is not between governments, it's between people.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Mm-hmm.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  And it's the freedom of an individual 
man or woman to purchase anything they want in a marketplace that 
you are defending.  And that is what the classical liberal 
tradition is.  I didn't mean to comment on it, but I was just 
saying the irony.<p> 
 
		We're sitting here, and the President of the United 
States is going to slap on -- who knows if they're going to make 
a last-minute agreement, but he's going to slap on a hundred 
percent tariffs on a certain product that will deny the American 
people the opportunity to purchase. 	<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Right.	<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  They said, "Well, they shipped it to us 
last year."  		<p> 
 
		Well, they didn't ship it to us without somebody making 
a choice in a marketplace freely without any cohesion to buy that 
product over someone else's product.  And that's called freedom.  
And that's why you're here.  	<p> 
 
		Ken Blackwell wants to ask you something.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER BLACKWELL:</b>  If I just might make --	<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  That's what your book is all about.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  I believe that it is possible today 
for you to find a good book that will help you to understand that 
border adjustability.<p> 
 
		It swims against the tide of the freedom revolution.  
And we have to work on that a little bit --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  What -- who's the publisher, Dick?<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Rennery (phonetic).<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Henry Rennery.		<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  I'm probably out of line for even --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Where can we get it?<p> 
 
		<b>PARTICIPANT</b>:  Any bookstore.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Oh, I'm sure at any bookstore.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Any bookstore.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  I'm sorry, I -- 	<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  You and Newt -- you and Newt Gingrich.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  I indulge myself at your expense, 
and you're very tolerant of me.	<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  You and Gingrich are so shy about 
hawking your book.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  (Laughter)  I'm not.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Ken Blackwell.		<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER BLACKWELL</b>:  Representative Armey, as I 
understand your proposal, it does more than just simplify rates.  
It positions all income as either income to capital or income to 
labor.  <p> 
 
		Now, there are critics who would say that under your 
proposal dividend income is exempt.  <p> 
 
		How do you respond to a proposal that we allow for a 
personal consumption allowance on labor income and then just deal 
with all income, whether to labor or to capital, exactly the 
same?<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  I appreciate that question.  <p> 
 
		Now, this is so -- we have so many fictions in what I 
call "the mythology of fairness in America."  And one of these 
fictions is the distinction between earned and unearned income.  <p> 
 
		First of all, no production takes place without some 
component combination of capital and labor.  We have, then, land 
in with capital.<p> 
 
		In fact, we have a very famous Democrat -- Senator -- 
named Senator Douglas that invented something called the "Cobb-Douglas Function," that showed you 
must have these combined so 
that you can provide a resource to the production process in the 
form of your labor or your capital.  And nobody will provide 
either unless they get some return on that provision.  	 
	I am not working for no pay, ladies and gentlemen.  I'm 
sorry, I'm not going to do it.  Nor am I going to make my capital 
available to you for no pay.  That's not selfish; that's just 
good sense.  I've got responsibilities to my family.<p> 
 
		So, what happens is the owners or the providers of 
capital generally become the owners of the business.  And in a 
large complex system of equity ownership as we have, they become 
stockholders.  Stockholders' share of earnings is dividends.  	<p> 
 
		What the flat tax does in its effort to capture every 
dollar's worth of earnings and tax at one time says, "We will tax 
those earnings generated by the capital component at the source, 
one time."<p> 
 
		So, when the business distributes dividends, it 
distributes after-tax earnings to the owners of the corporation.  
And so it seems to me that the fiction that somebody escapes 
taxation is without foundation.  <p> 
 
		Now, they'll boil this down to:  "Well, what happens if 
somebody inherited all his wealth?"  I always love this when 
Senator Rockefeller raises a point with me.  "That's not fair."<p> 
 
		You know, what can I say about that?  Some -- I mean, I 
didn't chose my parents so wisely from an economic point of view.  
They didn't have -- they weren't rich.  I mean, I thought I made 
a good choice in terms of their common sense and their good 
stewardship as parents, and I was lucky.  But some people are 
just lucky, they're born rich.<p> 
 
		I don't know what you're going to do about that.  I 
guess we can hate them forever.  But you don't do any economic 
good in the Nation by saying, "All right, therefore we must then 
punish you for your good fortune."<p> 
 
		What are you going to do with a basketball player?  
Gets a contract for <p> 
 
$5 million.  Now, I can't dribble a basketball.  I can dribble a 
football.  <p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		Nobody is going to pay me for playing basketball, but 
shall we --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Footballs are not supposed to be 
dribbled.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  I know that, but I can do it.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Wrong.<p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  But in any event --see, this, to 
me, falls clearly under the category of jealousy, envy, and 
frankly, I think, greed.  And it is not the better part of our 
American disposition to get fascinated by that.	<p> 
 
		Now, about the flat tax and going back to our failure 
in '86, I have to tell you, you must, then, accept this 
proposition.  It is fair to capture every dollar earned in the 
tax base and treat it all the same, with a single rate for all.<p> 
 
		And my motto is:  Stay flat or die.  When you start 
making exemptions, exceptions, you know, whether it be for the 
honorable motive of giving advantage to something you think is an 
honorable activity or for the what I consider dishonorable motive 
of punishing somebody because they happen to have some good 
fortune -- most often born out of your hard work, by the way -- 
then I think what you're going to do is destroy the simplicity 
and the honesty of the Code.  	<p> 
 
		And then, I could say, "Well, you take anybody that has 
over $500,000 a year annual income, irrespective of whether they 
earned their education it or inherited it, and punish them."  
Now, why?<p> 
 
		So, I know we have these detractors, but I think it is 
detractors that come from people that don't understand the 
purpose of a Tax Code.  <p> 
 
		The purpose of a Tax Code is to raise money to finance 
the government at the minimal imposition on the American people.  
It is not to create an equality of outcome or to somehow or 
another exercise that frankly can only in its bottom line be 
described as a bold-faced prejudice.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  We're going to close up at 1 o'clock.  
So, let's get some questions.<p> 
 
		John Wieland.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER WIELAND</b>:  Mr. Leader, thank you for being 
here, and thank you for spending so much time with us.<p> 
 
		I am a homebuilder and realtor, and I am also the 
chairman of the Heard (phonetic) Museum of Art in Atlanta, so 
exemptions are very dear to my heart.<p> 
 
		How are we going to be able to protect all the 
Americans who have invested in homes and made a 30-year decision, 
you know, based on the existing Tax Code?  How are we going to be 
able to encourage home ownership, which we all believe is the 
bedrock of, you know, much of our culture?  <p> 
 
		And I hate to think that Americans aren't generous, but 
I think that there is some correlation between the deductibility 
of charitable contributions and the willingness to give.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  There's a lot of anxiety about 
this.  And one of the things I would ask, too, one must always 
look at if, in fact, you find yourself living in a world where 
you have a special break or opportunity or advantage, such as a 
mortgage interest deduction, and it's precious to you, as it is 
to our homeowners today, you're going to have an obvious anxiety 
about living in a world where that special opportunity doesn't 
exist, but yet that's what I ask you to do.  <p> 
 
		Don't think about being in this world, of this Tax 
Code, without the home mortgage, because I, too, would fight 
that.  Think in terms of a whole new world, called the "Flat Tax 
World," where there's a growth, a growing opportunity.  <p> 
 
		Recognize, if you will, to my shock, less than 25 
percent of American homeowners take the home interest mortgage.  	<p> 
 
		I would argue that the -- incidentally, what I consider 
to be the second most important American Dream, to own your own 
home -- the first being to get your kids out of it --<p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		-- the American Dream, to own your own home, is 
prompted by impulses that are so far greater in your life than 
the Tax Code.  People aren't going to quit buying homes if we 
have a new tax world without that exemption.<p> 
 
		And I would suggest that when you look at what happens 
with interest rates -- and everybody agrees, even DRI, that did 
the study for the realtors, agrees the interest rates will go 
down, you get a compensation to the homeowner in terms of their 
affordability of a home.  <p> 
 
		When they have a more certain understanding that they 
will more certainly have a better job with a greater opportunity 
for a promotion and advancement in a growing economy, and they 
make that life decision on what home to buy or when and where to 
trade up.<p> 
 
		I have to tell you, if I were a realtor today, if I 
made my living out of home real estate transactions, I would pray 
for the "Flat Tax World," where I had  a growing economy, where 
more people had better jobs, with a more certain understanding 
I'd get my promotion and my pay raise and lower interest rates, 
and I know I'd sell more, better, bigger homes.<p> 
 
		But one must first, it seems, extricate oneself from 
one's own worst fears.  And that is a tough thing, because the 
flat tax is not a revision of the existing Tax Code.  The flat 
tax is a new tax code in a new world.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Herman Cain.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN</b>:  Congressman, thank you for being 
here.<p> 
 
		One of several of our presenters in the course of our 
meetings have brought up the issue relative to the flat tax 
proposal, the issue of investing in human capital.  <p> 
 
		As I understand it, under the flat tax proposal, it's 
basically revenue, amount of expenses, mostly in terms of 
financial capital, et cetera, human capital being how do we 
invest in the development of the human capital side of the 
equation long term with respect to growth.  How would you respond 
to that?  	<p> 
 
		And if I'm not mistaken, the flat tax approach, with no 
deductions, does not directly invest in human capital, or does 
it? <p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  The first thing you need to 
understand is a flat tax says that if there's going to be a 
public program in support of education, job training, that should 
be done on the expenditure side.<p> 
 
		But the Tax Code is about raising money.  And so I 
would say that the human capital question is not a question for 
the Tax Code, and it is a function.	<p> 
 
		But if I may, governments, I think, do particularly 
poor jobs of investing in human capital.  Government-sponsored 
training programs and so forth generally don't work out too well.<p> 
 
		I have a great deal of affection for the machinists in 
America.  They work together, and they are pushing an encouraging 
-- and getting very little support from any government entity -- 
a whole system of apprenticement.<p> 
 
		A young person going on a job, learning that job from a 
person who has been on that job, who knows they're going to work 
with and rely on that person beside them on the job, is going to 
learn the job and learn it right.<p> 
 
		Mike Berg, who didn't have an eighth grade education, 
taught me my job as an apprentice lineman when I was going to 
college.  And he was concerned, because if he's sitting on a pole 
and he hollers for a come-along, and I send him a coffin hoist, 
I've made his day worse off.  It was very important to him that I 
learn his job right.<p> 
 
		Government programs for human capital, in my 
estimation, become slush buckets for providers of human capital 
training.  So, I have a wariness about those programs.<p> 
 
		But what do we do with the Tax Code -- with the flat 
tax?  <p> 
 
		We say to the American family <p> 
 
wage-earner, "We will make it maximum possible for you to 
maintain for your own family's use, with a generous family 
allowance to begin with and then a low marginal rate, the maximum 
amount of your earnings."<p> 
 
		"And then, Mom and Dad, you decide what's the best 
school for your children, where is the best college for your 
children, what is the best training program."  <p> 
 
		And I dare say that in your pizza shop you probably, 
without any assistance from the federal government, have done a 
much better job of teaching youngsters the disciplines of 
workmanship, what Thorstein Veblen calls "the spirit of 
workmanship."  These things truly are learned by young people as 
they grow up.  <p> 
 
		And I hate to use the word "boondoggle" -- but I dare 
say that if I were going to use that word, I would probably be 
talking about government-sponsored program of investment in human 
capital.  So --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Any last minute questions?  Shirley 
Peterson.  And then Education Feulner.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER PETERSON</b>:  Congressman, thank you for 
being here today. <p> 
 
		I find many aspects of your proposal; very attractive.  
There's one aspect of it, however, that worries me.  As a former 
tax administrator, I have a concern about compliance.  <p> 
 
		And I am concerned that compliance would drop 
precipitously if we did not have withholding.  And I would like 
to hear your views on that subject.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Well, this is a -- it's probably 
the most controversial and <p> 
 
high-risk part of my proposal, and you'll find it probably in 
nobody's proposal.  <p> 
 
		The flat tax is, in a general sense, a Tax Code that 
bets on the goodness of the American people and not the guile of 
the federal government.  <p> 
 
		And it's a Tax Code, as I've envisioned it, that says 
to America, "We're going to give you a simple, direct, and honest 
bill for the size of big government and let you see as clearly as 
possible what it's costing you, because we bet that if you know 
how much it's costing you, you will vote for less big 
government."<p> 
 
		Now, in my scheme, I say to America, "We're not going 
to have a system of withholding.  We're going to ask you to sit 
down at your kitchen table the first of every month, and as you 
write your bills to here, there, and everywhere and you look at 
your Penney's bill and wonder, 'Did I get money's worth,' when 
you look at your rent bill or your mortgage payment and say to 
them, 'Am I getting my money's worth,' then you will write a 
check to Washington, D.C."  <p> 
 
		And you'll realize that "This is more than I paid for 
food, shelter, and clothing combined, and I wonder if I'm getting 
my money's worth?"	<p> 
 
		I think that's a healthy question for the American.<p> 
 
		Now, people say, "Well, Americans won't pay."  <p> 
 
		With all the enforcement power of the federal 
government, why would the same person who doesn't dare not pay 
their Penney's bill turn around and say, "But I'm not going to 
pay my IRS bill"?<p> 
 
		And I'll remind you what I had said earlier, there are 
many, many people in the world with whom I would pick a fight.  
The <p> 
 
IRS is not one of them. <p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		So, I honestly don't.  <p> 
 
		On the other hand, I think if a people say, "I got a 
fair, direct, honest bill that treated me the same as everybody 
else.  I know what my share of the cost is, and I can quickly 
compute what my neighbor's share is.  I know he's got to pay it," 
I think the goodness of the American people would come out, and 
compliance becomes less of a problem.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  But before we give <p> 
 
Ed Feulner the last question, I'd like for the press to know and 
our television audience to hear that we're taking this on the 
road.  	Bill Archer suggested that we do that in order to 
maximize the impact of the tax reform movement on the American 
people.  <p> 
 
		And we're going to be holding hearings in Boston; 
Omaha, Nebraska; Charlotte, <p> 
 
North Carolina; and Silicon Valley, California <p> 
 
-- among other things.		<p> 
 
		I told Charlie Rangel that I would like to see us maybe 
go into East Harlem or "Bed Sty" and talk about the particular 
problems of minority entrepreneurial-minded men and women. <p> 
 
		Matt Fong and I have talked about going into Watts and 
East L.A. to talk about minority entrepreneurship, but that is 
subject to the decisions to be made.  	<p> 
 
		But, Dick, we want to thank you so much for --<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  May I make a point?<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  -- your pedagogy. <p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  One point, Herman Cain, apparently 
I did not understand your question properly and went off on one 
of my tirades.  <p> 
 
		One of the things that I think will happen in a flat 
tax world is charitable contributions will go up.  We saw this in 
the '80s.  We reduced the tax value of a charitable contribution 
enormously in the '80s and, frankly, I might add, confounded it, 
so that you can't make a charitable contribution without a tax 
lawyer these days.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Mm-hmm.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  50 percent of the American people 
do not -- or 50 percent of the charitable contributions are never 
taken on taxes, and yet charitable contributions more than 
doubled in the '80s.  And I think that that's where you get 
investments in human capital that really pay off.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Yes.<p> 
 
		?? Southern sounding:  I just might add that I do not 
propose or support government-sponsored human capital programs.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Thank you.<p> 
 
		And finally, I --<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER</b>:  So, I want to point that out for the 
record.  That was not the intent of my question or the point that 
I was alluding to.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Oh, I appreciate that.  I knew 
that all along.  <p> 
 
		If I may miss Jack -- and final out to Shirley 
Peterson, when you go on the road and you ask people, "How about 
withholding?  Should --or should we or should we not have it?" -- 
one of the things you're going to find people express in a rather 
assertive fashion:  "It's my money in the first place.  Why 
should the government take some part of my money before I even 
get a chance to see it?"<p> 
 
		There's a certain assertiveness about that.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Bill.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  This would be a good way to end 
it.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Yes.  That is a great ending.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Thank you again.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Dick, thanks.  Well done.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Thank you.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  World class. <p> 
 
		Thank you all for coming.  <p> 
 
		The Commission will close our public hearings and get a 
bite to eat and discuss our next meeting.<p> 
 
		Staff is welcome to join us as well.<p> 
 (Whereupon, the public hearing of the National 
Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform was adjourned.)<p>

<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  (In progress) -- of the College
World Series, when the great events in this country.  I
happened to be here, as the Mayor knows, during the
College World Series.  <p>

		It's also the home of the "Entrepreneur of the
Year," Herman Cain of Godfather's Pizza.  And it is
under his auspices -- or at least aegis -- that we have
convened in Omaha.<p>

		And I would like the Commission to start with
some opening remarks from Mr. Cain, then the Mayor.  <p>

		And then we will proceed to our first panel.<p>

		Herman, thanks for your hospitality.  And we're
delighted to be in Omaha, Nebraska.<p>

<center><a name="Cain"></a>WELCOME BY COMMISSION MEMBER HERMAN CAIN</center>
<p><center>
<Font size="-1"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></Font>
</center><p>

		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN:</b>  Well, thank you, Jack.<p>

		I would simply like to say welcome to all of
the Commission Members who were able to make this
particular trip, because the schedule is somewhat tight
that our fearless leader has demanded in order for us
to get our job done.<p>

		And I am extremely proud of the fact that Omaha
was selected as one of the cities where we would have
one of our open hearings.<p>

		So, I simply would like to welcome all of the
Commissioners.  <p>

		I would like to welcome and thank everyone who
took time to attend today.<p>

		And I can tell you, from my own experiences in
attending the meetings thus far, that they have been
extremely interesting, extremely informative.  <p>

		And I am personally very optimistic about what
this Commission is today.  And today will be just
another step in being able to achieve, ultimately, what
our goal is.<p>

		So, as I indicated to someone earlier, when
they asked am I proud of the fact that we're having the
hearing here in Omaha, Nebraska, yes, I am -- very
proud.  <p>

		So, thank you, Jack. <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Mayor Daub, thanks for joining
us and allowing us to be in your fair city.  It's a
pleasure to be with you.<p>

<center><a name="Daub"></a>OPENING REMARKS BY MAYOR HAL DAUB OF OMAHA, NEBRASKA</center>
<p><center>
<Font size="-1"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></Font>
</center><p>

		<b>MAYOR DAUB:</b>  Well, Mr. Chairman -- and I used
to recall having the opportunity to say that to you
when you were my conference chairman when we served
together in the House of Representatives, it's always
good to see you and greet a friend and former
colleague.<p>

		And say to each of you a special and warm hello
from all of the citizens of Omaha, Nebraska, to
indicate to you that we feel honored.  <p>

		Not only are we proud of Herman Cain and all
that he does to help make this a sparkling and happy
and productive place to live, but you help us, as he
does, shine the spotlight on our city and our state of
Nebraska, and indeed the heartland.  <p>

		So, we bid you good morning and a welcome for
this second public hearing for the National Commission
on Economic Growth and Tax Reform.<p>

		This is the heartland.  We're very proud of our
productivity.  And you'll be listening to individuals,
men and women, on a very, very heavy schedule, as Mr.
Cain pointed out -- a very demanding schedule here in
Omaha today -- that speak for a variety and diversity
of business and industry.  They come from Illinois and
Iowa and Nebraska.  <p>

		So, I think you've well chosen this spot to
bring people together from the heartland and from the
greater Midwest to assess their view of where we need
to be in the years to come.<p>

		I'd like to extend a special welcome to all
those witnesses that you will have and to the people
who come to testify today.<p>

		And, of course, Jack, as I said, to especially
welcome you back so soon, when you were here to, I
guess, gauge how well this city can host and complement
opportunities as complex as the ones that you are
undertaking.<p>

		So, thank you, personally, each and every one
of you, for the work you're doing, for economic growth
and tax reform in our country.  		Through these
hearings and your report, people will be able to air
their concerns, ideas, and recommendations to help
stimulate economic growth in our country and to help
begin a process of tax reform. <p>

		I think, in fact, there are two great
happenings that are underway right now in our country.  <p>

		The first, from a Mayor's point of view, is a
Congress that is striving mightily to get their arms
around a gigantic federal system and to reshape it to
return power to local units of government and
particularly to do so without unfunded mandates.  I
think that's very significant, at least from the point
of view of governance. <p>

		The second, I think, great happening in America
is the undertaking of looking at our Tax Code -- and I
commend the Senator from Kansas, our Senator, Bob Dole
and the Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, for this
idea -- and, Jack, again, for your leadership in this
second great happening -- to see if we can't speak to
the future.<p>

		So, it is a historic opportunity.  		
Here, in Omaha city government, we're trying to set an
example for other communities and other units of taxing
authority to find innovative ways to approach tax
reform and economic growth.  <p>

		We've set priorities in our 1996 budget here so
we can begin to lower property tax rates for our
citizens.  We're engaged in that <p>

right-sizing process, too.  This will allow us to set a
pattern for meaningful tax reductions over the next few
years.  <p>

		We've also been hard at work to promote
economic growth in the 48th biggest city in America.  <p>

		Yes, Warren Buffet said he likes Omaha because
everything works in Omaha.  <p>

		And Walter Scott, of our Keywood Industries
organization, said he thought maybe the right answer to
Eddie was that maybe it's just the water.  <p>

		But whatever the reason, we're very proud of
what <i>Fortune</i> magazine said in rating Omaha "the ninth
most likely place you'd want to go if you want to set
your business on the fast track."  <p>

		In the high technology industry, to find one of
those cities, world-class cities of the 21st century,
you want to look at Omaha as high in brains and
entrepreneurial talent and the work ethic and work
productivity of this general area.  <p>

		So, we're mighty proud of how we're doing in
attracting more business and stimulating growth and
providing an atmosphere that will attract new
businesses and entrepreneurs that will help us grow.<p>

		I am confident you will seize this historic
opportunity and challenge all of us, but in particular,
as we take a look at this idea, that we can shed the
notion of our current tax policy and look to adopting a
more relevant process that will take us more fairly and
squarely to our future.<p>

		So, thanks again.  <p>

		Welcome to Omaha.  And I hope that you'll find
this hearing as informative as I know all of us will.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Thanks, Hal.<p>

		<b>MAYOR DAUB:</b>  Thank you very much.<p>

<center><a name="Kemp"></a>INTRODUCTION BY CHAIRMAN JACK KEMP</center>
<p><center>
<Font size="-1"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></Font>
</center><p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Thank you.<p>

		I introduced Herman Cain, who needs no
introduction.  <p>

		We're so pleased to have on our panel and our
Commission the president of the American Farm Bureau,
Dean Kleckner -- and as the Mayor said, we're in the
heartland of America -- thank you, Hal -- in the
heartland of America, no more important issue than tax
reform, entrepreneurship, working, saving, investing,
building a business, building a farm, investing in your
family.  These are the issues that our Commission is
undertaking.  <p>

		We are particularly pleased, on this
Commission, to have Loretta Adams, an entrepreneur --
and impresario from San Diego, California; Jack Faris,
the president of the National Federation of Independent
Business, NFIB, one of America's -- if not America's
premier representative of small, independent working
entrepreneurs and men and women in this country.<p>

		John Wieland, a homebuilder, one of the
distinguished homebuilders from Atlanta, Georgia.	<p>

		Teddy Forstmann, the founder of Forstmann
Little and one of American's financiers.<p>

		Shirley Peterson, former Commissioner of the
IRS, whose recent article was so perceptive in
outlining the problems of the current Code and some of
the answers that we are seeking.<p>

		Matt Fong, on my right, is the Treasurer of the
State of California, one of the rising stars not only
on the political scene but among the state treasurers
of the country.<p>

		Ken Blackwell, State Treasurer of Ohio is not
here, nor is John Snow, the CEO of CSX, who is in
Europe.  But they'll be joining us.<p>

		This is our sixth opening meeting.  This is our
second field hearing.  We were in Boston, now Omaha. 
We're going to Charlotte and San Francisco.  <p>

		We're also going to hold some tangential
hearings in different inner cities of the country to
explore the nexus between tax policy and poverty and
the problems of <p>

low-income minority entrepreneurs.<p>

		So, we're going to the run the gamut.  We have
heard from Democrats and Republicans.  Last night we
heard from Warren Buffet.  <p>

		Today we've got three panels.  We're going to
try to keep them within the range of <p>

45 minutes, have a break of about 10 to 15 minutes at
around 10:30, close down around <p>

12 o'clock, maybe 12:15.<p>

		We're going to have a little press availability
and then some Godfather's Pizza thanks to Herman Cain.<p>

		(Applause)<p>

		Thank you fellow employees of Godfather's
Pizza.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		One of the nice things about being chairman is
that everybody is sending me books.  I just sit back in
my office and look at books and articles and papers.  <p>

		And, you know, it really is interesting,
because somehow taxes -- it isn't <p>

-- somehow, it is absolutely a fact, taxes touch every
aspect of our lives.  It alters behavior.  It modifies
people's acts.  <p>

		The most recent book sent to me was "Good and
Evil, the Impact of Taxes in the History of
Civilization."  <p>

		Now, that's quite a study, but it goes back to
the Genesis -- the Book of Genesis and Abraham's -- I'm
sorry, Joseph's advice to Pharaoh.		<p>

		One of my favorite quotes was sent to me the
other day from my youngest son, who majored in
economics at Wake Forest.  <p>

		And he said, "Dad, I think you guys are on to
something."  <p>

		That's a tremendous concession from my son,
Jimmy Kemp.  But he's 23 years old and playing football
and he wrote.  He sent me a little Xeroxed page from
Will and Ariel Durant's "Story of Civilization" and
"The Decline of Greece," democracy in the Greek period,
and it said -- and I quote:<p>

		"The assembly degenerated into a mob, rejected
all restraint, voted itself every favor, and taxed the
people to the point of crushing their initiative, their
industriousness, and their thrift.  And democracy never
rose again."<p>

		The question was asked this morning of me by
one of the press representatives, "Are you a
Republican?"<p>

		I said, in answering, "We're center right. 
We're democratic Republicans."<p>

		There has to be a party -- there has to be a
movement in this country devoted to making democracy
work for all people.  <p>

		And the purpose of our hearings is to hear men
and women who are interested in <p>

tabula rasa vis-a-vis the Tax Court and writing a new
one, as Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich charged us with, for
the 21st century.  	<p>

		We're not going to wait for the 21st century,
because we want to present our product by the end of
October, maybe the end of November, and allow Democrats
and Republicans to look at the product of this
Commission's hearings and deliberations and to be in
Omaha with you, Herman, and you, Dean, our fellow
Commissioners in the first panel, to carry out what Bob
Dole and Newt Gingrich said was to bring about a
flatter, fairer, simpler, lower, pro-growth Tax Code
for American entering the 21st century.  <p>

		So, we see ourselves in a sense as the Founding
Fathers.  Maybe if a constitutional convention -- not
to suggest that any one of us have the incredible
intellect of those incredible people.  But we want to
look at the Code with an eye on how this country can
work better in a post-Cold War era of tremendous
possibilities, tremendous and exciting possibilities.<p>

		Let me suggest that our -- invite the first
panel, who will make a presentation of a perspective
from business and industry.<p>

		I'm going to ask Frank Hayes, the president of
Hayes &amp; Associates; Leroy Thom, president of T&amp;L
Irrigation Company; J. William Henry, executive vice
president, First National Bank of Omaha; Richard
Abramson, president and CEO of Prairie Systems, Inc.;
Gerald Schenken -- Dr. Schenken is president of The
Pathology Center; and Jeff Renner, principal office of
the Freeman Company.<p>

		If anybody in the audience who would like to
present a question to the panel, we are going to take
questions, but we're going to take them written down. 
That isn't to inhibit anybody; it is simply to try to
provide a little order to what could be a chaotic
process.  <p>

		We want to hear people -- very important that
this Commission hear from citizen groups.  <p>

		Talmudic philosopher said, one time, "There's a
lot of wisdom in the world.  Unfortunately, it's all
divided up among the people."<p>

		We don't think that's unfortunate.  We think
that's the best way; that's how markets work.  We think
markets are efficient, and we're delighted, gentlemen,
that you would be here.<p>

		And I'm going to start with Frank Hayes,
president of Hayes &amp; Associates, and move down.  We
would appreciate your brevity, but nonetheless we want
to hear the synthesis of your approach to tax policy. <p>

		Mr. Hayes, thank you for being here.<p>

PRESIDENT, HAYES &amp; ASSOCIATES</center>
<p>

<Font size="-1"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></Font>
</center><p>

		<b>MR. HAYES:</b>  Thank you.<p>

		First of all, I'd like to thank everyone.	<p>

		I just want to thank the Commission for
inviting me to come and give my perspective. <p>

		When I -- when Herman -- I know Herman -- when
-- I call him Herman -- hopefully, he doesn't get upset
about that.  <p>

		But when Herman first talked to me about this,
I hadn't really thought about tax reform.  And he was
telling me that he was involved on the Commission and
wanted to know what my perspectives were.  And we
talked a little bit.<p>

		He said, "I think you'd be a good person to
come and talk before the Commission."<p>

		Just to give you a little bit of background,
just to give you some sense about where I'm coming
from, I'm a CPA by profession.  I am a former IRS
agent.  At one time I also worked with an international
accounting firm for a number of years as the head of
their tax department.<p>

		(Off-mike remarks)<p>

		<b>MR. HAYES:</b>  Oh, yeah, let me switch gears.<p>

		There goes the brevity. <p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  We'll decide that, Frank.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		<b>MR. HAYES:</b>  As I said, I was an IRS agent.  I
worked for an international accounting firm for several
years.  <p>

		And also, after that, I started my own
accounting firm in 1983, so I've been in business as
Hayes &amp; Associates for the last 12 years.<p>

		And in doing this, we've worked with some
businesses, individuals, corporations, <p>

not-for-profit organizations.  And all of those
particular clients are all concerned about taxes.  And
we spent an enormous amount of time over those number
of years trying to figure out how to cut taxes for
people.  <p>

		And I think my basic thrust on this whole issue
is that I think if there's a way to make things more
simple, more fair, and sort of take the tax aspect out
of making day-to-day business decisions, I think
everybody would become productive.<p>

		As an accountant -- and as you know, we do a
lot of a tax work -- so a lot of people would say,
"Sell, as an accountant, how can you advocate making
something simpler, when it might make you lose your
job?"<p>

		Well, I think, as advisers, as business
advisers, as CPAs, we can still be more -- we can be
more productive if we can divorce ourselves from having
to make decisions strictly on a tax basis.	<p>

		And as you said, Chairman Kemp, it touches
everything that we do.  And if there is a way for us to
change that, so that as we go day to day in our
individual life or in our business life, where we can
make business decisions and not tax decisions, I think
it makes everyone more productive.<p>

		I don't know exactly all the specifics of what
you've talked about as far as how you're going forward
with this.  Maybe you haven't formulated those yet.  <p>

		But one of the things that I think happens with
a business -- and we work with a lot of businesses --
people come into the office and they say, "Well, how
can I cut my taxes?  How can I cut my taxes?"  <p>

		And that's more -- the biggest decision that we
have to sit down and talk to them about.  And a lot of
people get very frustrated, because we have business
owners who invest in their business, they go out and
they buy new equipment, they renovate or rehab their
facilities.  And then, at the end of the year, they
say, "Well, can't I deduct that?"  <p>

		And we say, "No.  You have to capitalize it and
depreciate it."<p>

		So, the person -- and then you've got to pay
taxes on money you reinvested back in the business.<p>

		So, people say, "Well, I don't have any money. 
The money isn't there.  I put it all back in the
business.  How am I going to pay these taxes?"<p>

		So, I guess, in my way of thinking, I think if
there is a way, as a Commission, that you can formulate
some ideas that will allow business decisions to be
made more on an economic basis, as opposed to a tax
basis, I think you would go real, real far in making
things a lot more simple, and also creating more
productivity in the meantime.<p>

		And as an accountant, I feel like it would be
an opportunity for us, as advisers, to do a better job
of advising our business clients, instead of just
focusing on the tax orientation.<p>

		The other thing I'd like to say is, is that
there are some, I guess, adverse things I think I need
to say about tax reform.  And as I said, I think one of
them is that, as a CPA, it's obviously going to impact
our business.  So, no one in their right mind would
advocate doing something that's going to do away with
the revenue source for them. <p>

		The other thing I might say is that I'm
concerned a little bit about it -- and I would hope
that you guys consider this in your deliberations.  I'm
concerned about charitable organizations.  I feel very
strongly that charitable organizations do a great
service in this country.  <p>

		And to a large degree, at least in my
experience, some people make charitable donations
because they feel they can deduct them for tax
purposes.  Now, maybe that's not the main reason, but
in a lot of cases that's one of the reasons.  So, I
think there should be some consideration given to that.<p>

		Another thing that I think that has happened
with the Tax Code over the last several years -- and I
know, Chairman Kemp, you're very in favor of this -- is
enterprise zones.  And there are some tax incentives
that go with that.  		And I think whatever you do
there should be some kind of consideration given to
encourage, incent (sic), whatever you will, economic
development in depressed areas.  And the enterprise
zones have been a good way to do that, and you've used
the Tax Code to try to get that done.<p>

		So, I think if you do make it simpler, you
still should have those kinds of things incorporated in
your plan so that there is some incentive to invest in
economically depressed areas.<p>

		But in summary, I guess I would say that I'm
very much in favor of some kind of simplification
process.  I sort of come there.  I wasn't there.  I
wasn't there when I first heard about this, because of
the things I said earlier.  <p>

		But I think what it would allow us to do as
advisers -- and, also, would allow the business to do -- is make better decisions, better business decisions,
and get so much away from the tax implications and more
on the economic side.<p>

<p><center>
<Font size="-1"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></Font>
</center><p>

<center>PRESIDENT, T&amp;L IRRIGATION CO.</center>
<p>

		MR. <b>MR. THOM:</b>  Thanks to the Commission to having
me here.<p>

		I'm a small businessman, celebrating my
fortieth anniversary.  Our company is T&amp;L Irrigation,
Hastings, Nebraska.  We sell irrigation equipment in
all of the states and in 12 foreign countries.  And at
the present time, we have 200 employees. <p>

		We all know that taxes are too high.  And we
have structured taxes so they slow economic growth.  <p>

		And I'm going to give you some of my personal
experience.  <p>

		Tax forms need to be simplified.  In 1994, our
tax form was the size of a small textbook.  We put
approximately 500 hours of our own, in-house, preparing
it.  The CPA put 230 hours preparing it.  And I don't
think -- only one knew somewhat what we were doing, and
that was the CPA.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		I had to sign that, but I didn't know exactly
what I was signing, except -- you know.  		So, what
has happened is Congress has made the tax laws and
regulations so complex that it takes someone who
specializes in tax law, working full-time, to interpret
these laws and regulations.<p>

		We have to find some way to get it down,
simple.<p>

		The last time I was audited by the IRS, it took
13 months to get the audit over.  At the end of 13
months, they didn't find enough mistakes to pay for
their people that were at the office.  Plus, I don't
know how many hours my staff put in helping them with
the audit.<p>

		A lot of time -- and pretty much what Frank
says, a lot of time is spent by everyone to minimize
their taxes because of the current laws.  This time
would be better spent in making profit for the
business.<p>

		There are many changes needed to be made in the
tax law, but here are a couple of what I call someone
asinine things. <p>

		Depreciation laws need to be reformed so a
taxpayer can advantage of the deduction in his
lifetime.<p>

		For example, I am building a new office.  It
will be depreciated for 39-1/2 years.  I'll be 110 if
I'm lucky.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		My youngest son will be 75.<p>

		Now, that is one thing.  Another one is we have
a lot of people on the road.  We have truck drivers,
servicemen, and salesmen.  We only get to deduct 50
percent of their meals.  Isn't this a legitimate
expense of business?<p>

		Another one is laws requiring retirement plans
need to made simpler.  We need to encourage taxpayers
to save for their retirement.  The current laws are so
complex and the fees and the administration costs of
these retirement plans are so prohibitive that many
small businesses can't offer this program to their
employees.  <p>

		Now, we come to taxes.  At the present time,
the federal and state tax puts T&amp;L at 46 percent.  This
does not include real estate tax, property tax,
personal tax, sales tax, fuel tax, and so forth.  <p>

		Then we come to the most regressive tax, estate
tax.  T&amp;L already has paid 46 cents.  When I pass on,
my estate will pay 55 percent of the last 54, which is
30 cents, which means that it can total 76 cents of
every dollar that I pay (sic) goes to those two taxes,
which does not include that other list of taxes that I
had.	<p>

		Worst of all, this means that the family
business will need to be sold in many cases to pay the
estate taxes.  <p>

		In my case, I have two sons in the business,
and I'd like to keep the business in the family.  But
with the current estate tax, this may not be possible.  <p>

		This will be detrimental not only to my family,
but also long-term employees.  This is very true in the
family farm in our area.  <p>

		You know, a family farm in our area is from 640
acres to 4,000 acres of row crop.  Many times, so much
of this ground has to be sold to pay the estate tax,
that when the next generation takes control, the family
farm is too small to be profitable, and they lose the
whole thing.<p>

		So, in summary:<p>

			Simplification of taxes and forms.<p>

			Improved incentives of capital expenditure
to create more business.<p>

			Reduce the estate tax to help preserve
small business and family farms.<p>

			Reduce the maximum tax rate to encourage
expansion and economic growth.<p>

			Get the government off the business backs,
such as OSHA, EPA, and all the other regulations that
are needed.		<p>

		In closing, this is a little bit off the
subject, the problem is the government is spending too
much.  I feel the only way that you can reduce
government spending is across-the-board spending cuts
so all divisions of government are taking a cut.  <p>

		Government is unwanted partner in business.  It
only takes the cream, doesn't help the business, takes
all of the profits out, and feeds nothing back to make
it grow.		<p>

		Thank you much for the opportunity.<p>

		(Applause)<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Well, Leroy, you have spoken on
behalf of all of the Commissioners.  And I'm sure with
all due respect to our panelists, I just can't help but
mention, on behalf of the Commission, that you are
preaching to the choir.  This is why Bob Dole and
Newt Gingrich set up this Commission.  <p>

		And hang in there, Leroy.  Help is on the way.<p>

		You speak for every small businessman and woman
in America.  We appreciate your testimony.<p>

for First National Bank of Omaha.<p>

		Bill, thank you -- or William, whichever you
would like to be called.<center></center>

<a name="Henry"></a><center>PRESENTATION BY J. WILLIAM HENRY<br>
EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENTFIRST NATIONAL BANK OF OMAHA </center>
<p>
<center>
<Font size="-1"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></Font>
</center><p>

		<b>Mr. HENRY:</b>  I thank the Commission for the
opportunity to testify in this important matter.<p>

		The First National Bank and its affiliates
operate community banks in four Midwestern states, with
total assets of approximately $6 billion, and we employ
just over 4,000 people.  We are a leader in
agricultural lending and equipment leasing.  <p>

		We are committed to Main Street, retail and
small business lending in our communities, and we are
one of the Nation's leading issuers of bank card and
processing merchant transactions.<p>

		Our effective tax rate is one of the highest in
the country for financial institutions.  It has, on
average, exceeded the statutory tax rate over the last
three years.  As of June 30, 1995, our effective
federal tax rate is 35.102 percent.  <p>

		We are not a company which seeks to avoid our
taxes.  We're a good corporate citizen, and we support
a simpler tax system in which everyone will pay their
fair share.  It is good for our country, our customers
as well as ourselves.<p>

		We believe in real, meaningful tax reform.  The
cost in financial management resources of complying
with the current federal Tax Code places a tremendous
burden on all business and weighs most heavily on the
smallest and most entrepreneurial businesses.  <p>

		The costs of taxes are, in and of themselves, a
highly regressive tax, taking a proportionately much
higher toll on small business than on large business. 
This is a problem.<p>

		Furthermore, the current Tax Code is filled
with exceptions, exemptions, alternatives, and offsets,
which tend to benefit bigger business, better equipped
to take full advantage of all potential tax benefits. 
This is also a problem.<p>

		From a banker's perspective, a simpler, more
cost-effective, and fairer Tax Code is going to help
our economy.  It will free capital and management
resources to invest in the future and produce more
jobs.  <p>

		It will also increase the demand for bank
credit, to help fund this investment.  This will
benefit banks; and through the laws of supply and
demand, it will benefit our depositors as well.<p>

		Tax reform really can be good for everyone, but
we encourage you to carefully consider two issues which
could undermine the very advantages you hope to create
through tax reform.<p>

		First, be careful how you tax financial
institutions.  There seems to be a perception among
lawmakers that banks are somehow special and difficult
to tax.  This is really not true.  Banks are
fundamentally like all businesses.  <p>

		We have raw material costs, manufacturing
costs, inventory costs, and gross margins.  Our only
real difference is that our raw material and our
finished product are dollars, as opposed to tons or
units.  <p>

		So, tax proposals which exempt investment
income from taxation have a problem with banks, since
they confuse our finished product with investment.<p>

		Bank deposits and bank interest income must be
treated as the raw material costs and rent receipts
that they are.  This is the only way to permit the
market to define bank income on an institution-by-institution basis.  <p>

		We strongly urge you not to succumb to the
temptation of using an arbitrary formula or simplistic
and inaccurate assumptions about market cost to mask
the issue.<p>

		Second, be aware of a growing national problem
being created by state taxation of interstate commerce
in intangible goods and services.  <p>

		This is not a federal tax issue.  This is a
federal issue.  The taxation of interstate commerce --
and it is the potential to severely undermine the
benefits of all federal tax reform.  <p>

		The core of the problem is that every state can
and should tailor its tax codes to its own unique
needs.  This exposes companies involved in interstate
commerce to double and triple taxation.<p>

		As more states become aware of their right
companies located in other states, they have begun to
seek back taxes and alter their codes to increase the
proportion of state tax which can be collected out-of-state.  <p>

		The costs of implementation, compliance, and
litigation are continuing to mount.  The effect on the
national economy of these costs and the immeasurable
cost of uncertainty about the future should not be
understated.  <p>

		This is not just a bank issue.  It involves
technology, communications, and services generally, and
it will affect our global competitiveness.<p>

		The 86th Congress recognized this basic problem
and forbid states to tax companies which have no
presence within their borders except sales
relationships.  <p>

		But in 1959, when the U.S. had a goods economy,
the protection provided was specifically limited to
tangible goods.  We now have a service economy, and the
interstate commerce in services and intangibles is not
covered by federal protection.  <p>

		The solution to this problem is simple,
congressional action to extend existing service to
services and intangibles, but the solution is
politically difficult for the federal government and
potentially expensive for state governments.<p>

		Unfortunately, the longer we wait to resolve
it, the more expensive and difficult it will become. 
We strongly urge the Commission to address this serious
problem in your report.<p>

		Thank you for letting me testify.  A copy of my
remarks are available for you.<p>

		<b>MR. ABRAMSON:</b>  Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I really appreciate the opportunity here to come and
speak before the Commission and at the invitation of
the NFIB.<p>

		I am a small businessman here in Omaha, the
founder of a company by the name of Prairie Systems
that develops software for the high technology
industry, primarily telecommunications.  We're a five-year-old company and growing very rapidly very
recently.  We were given an award as "The Second-
Fastest Growing Company in Omaha."	<p>

		The Tax Code has a great impact on our business
and our need for capital.  <p>

		I also was the chairman of the White House
Conference on Small Business for the Nebraska
delegation that recently met.  And I can tell you that
taxation was one of the hottest topics at the White
House Conference on Small Business.<p>

		I would also tell you that Mr. Thom -- his
testimony very much reflects that of the small business
community that was represented there.  And I second
everything that he said.<p>

		The thing I believe that is encouraging here is
that there are a number of proposals out for tax
reform, and I really commend you for that.<p>

		The high, progressive tax system today
discourages savings and investment.  And that's the
aspect that I want to hit on today, because I've felt
the pinch of this.  And certainly that discouragement
of savings and investment seriously harms the economy
by reducing capital formation and investment in small
business such as mine.  <p>

		In my opinion, an ideal tax system does not
penalize or subsidize various economic choices. 
However, I think the current tax system does, in fact,
do that.<p>

		Unfortunately, one of the most destructive
elements of the current Tax Code is the multiple levels
of taxation on investment and savings.  <p>

		Just as savings, dividends, businesses and
other forms of investment income are penalized by
personal income tax, capital  formation is hindered by
corporate income tax, capital gains taxes, estate and
gift taxes, depreciation tax, and by corporative
alternative minimum taxes. <p>

		An example here is if a taxpayer, after he pays
his personal income tax, has $100 to do something with. 
One choice he can do is go out and consume that, spend
it on goods and services or vacations and haircuts, and
various things like that, and, with the exception of
sales tax, get about $100 worth of benefit from that
$100.<p>

		Alternatively, he can make a choice to invest
those dollars in a small business like mine or many
others that fuel the growth in this country.  In that
case, he takes the opportunity to create new jobs and
to spur the economy and create new products and
services.<p>

		If the company succeeds, the investor will
likely benefit from that.  Alternatively, he's put it
completely at risk, and that $100 may disappear.<p>

		In the example here, let's assume that this
investment does bear fruit and gets a 10 percent return
on that, which means that the investment yields $10 of
income for every $100 invested.  <p>

		Under the current Tax Code, 34 percent of that
is skimmed to pay the corporate income tax, leaving
only $6.60 out of that original $10.  <p>

		Let's assume that $6.60 then goes to the
investor as a dividend, but he then faces other taxes. 
Depending on the investor's income, the personal income
tax will take as much as 40 percent off of his $6.60,
leaving him less than $4 of annual income in this
successful investment that he made.  In addition, he
probably has some form of state and local taxes to pay.<p>

		Finally, if this investor decides to sell off
this stock, he now gets subjected to -- hit by one of
the highest capital gains taxes in the industrialized
world.  <p>

		And I think the White House Conference on Small
Business gave very large support to reduction or
elimination of the capital gains tax.<p>

		What little income he eventually receives from
saving and investment have taken <p>

-- it's a small return compare to the risk that he has
had to take to get it there.<p>

		To add insult to injury, as Mr. Thom has
pointed out, successful entrepreneurs who are trying to
accumulate an estate, then, to pass on to their
children face the possibility of 55 percent taxation on
those assets.<p>

		Thanks to the Tax Code, a fortunate investor,
one who actually earns money on his investment, may
have to send more than half of his earnings to the
government, not to mention having already paid taxes on
the money in the first place that he invested.<p>

		In my opinion, by punishing this savings and
investment, this Tax Code encourages businesses and
individuals to consume rather than save and to build
America.  <p>

		As a result, to small business owners like
myself, there is very limited capital available.  We're
a very high-growth business, and it takes a lot of
capital to grow at that rate.  <p>

		The results of investment, venture capital
kinds of firms demand a 50 percent annual return and up
on their investments in order to, first of all,
mitigate some of the risks that they've taken, but also
to return a decent profit to their organization after
all these taxes have been paid.<p>

		My business is ideal to that sort of venture
investment, and it's enormously expensive to build and
grow a small business with that.<p>

		I believe that a consumption-based tax, with
careful attention to the avoidance of this double
taxation, should be the goal of tax reform.<p>

		I think there's a real danger here, though, in
that the mechanism for getting from where we are to any
form of tax, but especially a consumption tax, I think
is especially ticklish.  And the worst of all worlds
would be to end up with both an income tax and some
form of an income (sic) tax.<p>

		And so in my opinion, a shift to a consumption
tax would require repeal of the 16th Amendment to get
rid of income tax.  <p>

		I do applaud the efforts of this Commission.  <p>

		The small business community is enormously
concerned about these issues.  It's long overdue that
we have tax reform in this country.<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  Thank you very much, <p>

Mr. Chairman.  <p>

		And because of time constraints, I have
submitted some written testimony -- <p>

		CHAIRMAN MILES:  Sure.<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>: -- which I hope you'd put in the
record for me.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Well, please be assured that
the written testimony will be passed along to all of
the members of the Commission, and it will be part of
our official record -- and also the Commissioners who
aren't here.  So, we appreciate that. <p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  Thank you very much.<p>

		It's a pleasure to be here.  <p>

		I'm president of a medical laboratory.  We have
about 210 employees.  We provide laboratory services
for doctors, patients, and hospital in western Iowa,
northwestern Missouri, and Nebraska.<p>

		As you may or may not know -- those of you are
involved in health care may know that while there are
probably some competitive problems out there in health,
that doesn't run over into the lab area, which has been
competitive for about 25 years.  <p>

		And we compete every day with multibillion
dollar organizations.  And I can tell you competition
is fun, but it's hard work.<p>

		About 50 percent of our employees are
professionally trained.  The majority of them are
female.  About 70 percent of our employees are from
two-income families.  And a significant number of our
senior managers are female and are the senior earners
in their families.<p>

		I bring this to you because I want you to know
the perspective from which I am going to raise some
issues.<p>

		Now, I have also been a former board member of
both the Nebraska and the Omaha Chamber of Commerce and
long-time member of the NFIB.  And twice I was elected
to the White House Conference on Small Business.  <p>

		And I have had the privilege of testifying
hundreds of times on issues relating to health or
economics or tax issues in front of Congress.<p>

		So, let me open my testimony by telling you
what I experienced.<p>

		1984, I believe, was the 10-year anniversary of
ERISA.  And there was a Labor Department hearing on the
thing.  <p>

		And I testified, and I said, "You know, health
was included in ERISA by accident," which I believe it
to have been. <p>

		And what happened was that because of ERISA's
exemption, we had one aspect of the health insurance of
the United States which was completely free of state
regulation, state mandate, state this, state that, and
left the insurance companies noncompetitive because
they all had all of the mandates, they had all of the
regulations, and so forth.<p>

		I'm not saying one is good or one is bad, but
this is just one of many examples in which the
discrepancies within these regulatory and tax --
ultimately tax codes did not jive and left small
businesses -- I'll tell you in a minute -- holding the
bag.<p>

		Now, basically I believe the problem to be that
there are huge numbers of incentives and disincentives
in the current tax law and code.  And as a doctor, I
could call them disordered, dysfunctional, and
destructive.<p>

		And my big call to you, as you simplify them,
make sure they go in the same direction and they help
businesspeople make business decisions to be productive
and create wealth and so forth, rather than going in
the other directions.<p>

		And I'm going to focus quickly on four issues
that relate to small businesses, my operation and
others:		<p>
<ul>
<li>Health insurance,
<li>The marriage penalty.
<li>Inheritance tax.
<li>And spending.
</ul><p>
		Health insurance -- small business has been
chided for not providing health insurance by people who
don't understand small business.  There are two real
reasons for it.  <p>

		One is we have not been able to create the type
of groups we need to.  That's another issue.<p>

		But the other has been that individuals and
small businesses have been prevented from having the
tax sheltering ability that normal corporations have.  	<p>

		I provide my employees through -- I'm a
professional corporation, and we provide them -- for
everybody.  But my small business colleagues, my farmer
friends, and so forth are penalized by the Tax Code,
and then they're penalized again because they have to
get individual tax policies.<p>

		And while I'm on health, I think we should
recognize one of your panel members, who is one of two
people -- I won't mention the other one -- but one of
the two people who stood up at the time when health was
about to be nationalized and said, "Small business
can't deal with this."<p>

		Thank you, Mr. Cain.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Here, here.<p>

		(Applause)<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  -- all by himself.  A lot of
help, but -- that was the beginning, in my opinion --<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  He had one --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  In my opinion -- editorial
comment here -- that was the beginning of the end to
the --<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  That was it.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  -- nationalized health
insurance --<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  That was it.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  -- more in America.	<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  That was it.<p>

		And I was watching it on television --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Electric night.<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  -- and I turned to my wife and
said, "It's over."<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  So did I.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		So did I.<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  Yes.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  I said, "This is the beginning
of the end." <p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  Second, marriage penalty -- you
all know the marriage penalty within the Code.  I won't
mention it to you.  It is a big problem in the double-income families.<p>

		All three of my children are double-income
families and will be so even if they don't afford it --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Right.<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  -- because both halves have
career aspirations --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Right.<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  -- and things that they want to
do in life. <p>

		And I think you have to do that.  And the
biggest problem with the marriage penalty now is on the
benefit side, where most benefits are "Use it or lose
it."  <p>

		And that is one of the many reasons we've gone
to a cafeteria plan, self-insurance, so that our
husband-and-wife combinations can get equity between
the two jobs.  There are a lot of ways to change that,
but that is a big, big problem.<p>

		Third, inheritance tax -- I think <p>

Mr. Thom has done the job on inheritance tax.  I must
tell you it is not -- this is not a problem for
corporations with 200 employees.  It is for him.  But
it is a giant problem for small businesses,
restaurants, farmers, and so forth and so on. <p>

		And I must also say that just because we're
focusing on small business, our large corporate friends
need tax relief as well.  So, don't forget that there
are big people out there.<p>

		Finally -- and this is the problem -- and that
is, where you stand on taxes depends on where you sit. 
And everybody is anti-tax, but all surveys show that,
in spite of what they say, they are pro-services from
government.  And it's a very difficult line to walk.<p>

		I do not believe successful tax relief can be
attained unless there is something done about overall
spending, because overall spending will ultimately, as
I've said in my testimony, jurisdictional shifts of tax
burdens which will then create an entrusting populace.  <p>

		So, I would urge you, as you do this, to see if
we can figure out some sort of a tax limitation,
whether it's Gross National Product related, gross
state product related -- there are different ways to
go.  We need to do capping on the spending side,
otherwise nobody will trust you underneath it.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Right.	<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  And to close on that and to
focus on the need of public education, my mother, rest
her soul, will forgive you for whoever spent my name
with a G.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Ah.<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  Now, the person who did it
probably -- I think, knows me -- looked at my resume
for dozens of times where it says J -- her last name
was Jerald, that's where I got the name J -- and still
wrote G.  <p>

		And that's the same problem with the Tax Code. 
People have the fairness issue.  They have the "Tax the
other people."  They have the Russell Long "Don't tax
you, don't tax me, tax the man behind the tree." 
That's so in their mind that they will see things which
do not exist in taxes. <p>

		So, whatever you do, we need to have a very
strong --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Well said.<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  -- national program.  <p>

		Thank you, sir.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Thank you.<p>

		Jerald with a J.<p>

		Jeff Renner is the principal officer of The
Freeman Company.<p>

		We're delighted Mr. Renner and look forward to
your testimony.<p>

		Do you want to move.<p>

		<b>MR. RENNER:</b>:  Yes.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Jerald with a J.<p>

		On behalf of Jack, Joanne, Jeffrey, Judith, and
Janice, I agree with you.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  Geoffrey with a G.<p>

PRINCIPAL OFFICER, THE FREEMAN CO., INC.</center>
<p>

<Font size="-1"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></Font>
</center><p>


		MR. RENNER:  Thank you, Chairman Kemp and
members of the Commission.<p>

		I'm a small businessman, also, primarily
engaged in banking and real estate.  However, I've also
had 15 years of experience in government.<p>

		You've heard an awful lot of reasons today why
there should be a major overhaul of the Nation's Tax
Code.  <p>

		But the single over-riding reason is this, that
the current Tax Code is an enormous waste of
everybody's time.<p>

		A Heritage Foundation study estimated that
Americans spend 5.4 billion manhours annually complying
with the Tax Code and with tax planning and record-keeping and tax return preparation.<p>

		And I saw a recent article in the Wall Street
Journal that estimated that the current Tax Code costs
our economy 6 billion hours annually.<p>

		So, I did some quick calculations.  That's the
equivalent of 10,000 lifetimes wasted every year.<p>

		According to the Tax Foundation, the compliance
costs for the federal income tax last year cost
American business alone $127 billion.  And it cost all
Americans $200 billion.  That's an amount equal to the
output of our automobile, truck, and aircraft
industries combined. <p>

		That time and effort and money did not educate
a single child, it didn't feed a single family, and it
didn't produce a single tangible product to improve the
life of anyone.<p>

		The main reason for this waste of time and
money is the sheer complexity of the Tax Code.  In its
present form, it's impossible for many Americans to
even comply with the tax laws simply because they can't
understand it.<p>

		I had the personal experience at one time of
being told by the government to handle a transaction in
a certain manner, only to be audited and later told
that it should have been done differently.  <p>

		Unfortunately, ignorance of the law is no
excuse for we American citizens.  But equally as
unfortunate, the ignorance of the law seems to be the
only excuse required of our employees.<p>

		Another focus of the Commission's work is the
basic principles and objectives that the reform plan
must embody.  And I would suggest that these are three: 
Simplicity, stability, and fairness.<p>

		A recent Andersen Consulting survey revealed
that simpler forms and filing instructions were among
individuals' top tax concerns.  And I saw another
survey that showed that over 70 percent of the college
graduates in this country can't compute their own
taxes.<p>

		Now, our Tax Code should be simple enough so
that an individual is able to prepare and file his or
her own tax return.<p>

		I'm one of those college graduates who can't
file his own tax return.  And last year it cost me over
$5,000 just to file my own personal tax return.  And
that's ridiculous.<p>

		The current complexity of the Tax Code leads, I
think, to this instability.  In an eight-year period,
we've seen six major tax bills pass the Congress.  <p>

		And these constant attempts to correct or fine
tune the Tax Code lead to more change and more
uncertainty, making it impossible for individual
Americans to meaningfully plan for their own future.<p>

		Americans need to be able to understand what
the Tax Code is and know that it's going to remain
reasonably stable.<p>

		Finally, the Tax Code must be fair, and this is
the most difficult term to define.  But we do know that
the current Tax Code pits organized special interest
groups with money and lobbyists against families with
children and limited resources.  They can't compete in
that arena.<p>

		The current tax compliance system costs small
businesses proportionately 10 times more than large
corporations, as Mr. Henry pointed out.<p>

		A fair Tax Code, I suppose, would be one that's
more uniform, that would tax all income without special
exceptions and loopholes, hopefully at a lower rate;
that it would tax all income the same way, regardless
of the source, and would tax it only once. <p>

		By eliminating the complexity and introducing
stability and fairness through uniformity, I think that
we, as a nation, can redirect our time and energy and
resources toward production and economic growth.<p>

		Thank you.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Great.  Thank you.<p>

		Thank all of you.  Very eloquent.<p>

		Herman Cain -- Mr. Cain.<p>

		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN:</b>  Thank you, Chairman Kemp. <p>

		I want to direct my question.  I would like to
ask all of you the question, but time only allows me to
direct the question to just two of you.  <p>

		So, Mr. Renner and Mr. Hayes -- Frank -- I'll
direct it.<p>

		When I was asked to participate on this
Commission by Jack Kemp and Newt Gingrich, one of the
reasons I said yes, that I would participate, was
because the charge was not to come up with incremental
changes to a system that is as screwed up as all of you
have indicated, but to replace the current system.<p>

		And, Jerry, when you were talking about the
mind-set that we've got to break with the American
public in order to replace, which is a revolutionary
jump from where we are today, it's going to take a
couple of things:<p>

		One, there has to be a groundswell with respect
to the American public that will put the pressure on
the politicians to be able to make that leap.<p>

		My question is:  What, in your opinion, are
some of the things we can do to create the proper
groundswell that will give it the necessary momentum
that will cause the lawmakers to make the necessary
leap that we have to make if we all collectively are
going to be successful at replacing the current Tax
Code?<p>

		Yes.  Start with you, Jerry.  And then Frank.<p>

		<b>MR. RENNER:</b>  Well, we could spend a long time
or a short period of time.  I think I'll go short.<p>

		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN:</b>  Okay.<p>

		<b>MR. RENNER</b>:  It is clear to me that when the
American public is given good information, they almost
always make good decisions.  <p>

		And I wrote a letter to Mr. Gingrich as soon as
the Congress changed this last time -- which I will
forward a copy to you -- and warned him that if we
balance the budget without the public's understanding
of tax policy and so forth, that we, the Republicans --
excuse me for doing that, but that's what I am -- would
end up suffering, because people would be critical of
stuff that was done properly because they wouldn't
understand it.<p>

		I believe what you are doing will do more than
any other single thing, but you have to not just go to
Omaha, Nebraska, you have to go to Cozad, Nebraska --
not necessarily you, but you could have subcommittees. 
But if people really understand things, I think we're
okay.<p>

		One example, look at all the people that
believe that they themselves have paid for their Social
Security benefits and their Medicare.  They actually
believe it.  And until they understand the facts,
they're not going to change it.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Frank Hayes.<p>

		<b>MR. HAYES:</b>  Yes.  Herman, I think, just to echo
what Mr. Renner said, it has to be understandable.  <p>

		And that's why I like the flat tax, because if
the average individual does not understand it -- and
right now nobody, pretty much, understands the Tax Code
unless you work with it every single day -- if you
don't get that understanding on the part of the average
individual, if you do not reach that as part of your
recommendations, then you won't, in my estimation, have
the groundswell of support, because people won't know
what they're for.  <p>

		So, it has to be something that is simple
enough that it's understandable to the average person.  <p>

		And if you don't get that, I doubt very
seriously if you're going to get the groundswell of
support, because nobody is going to understand it.  <p>

		And I guess that's what Mr. renner said, and I would just echo that.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Thank you.<p>

		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN:</b>  Thanks.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Commissioner Kleckner.<p>

		COMMISSIONER KLECKNER:  Thank you, Jack.<p>

		Incidentally, we're in Omaha, Nebraska, but
right across the river is Council Bluffs, Iowa, my home
state.  	<p>

		So, Herman, do I have your permission to
welcome everybody --<p>

		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN:</b>  Yes, Dean.	<p>

		COMMISSIONER KLECKNER:  -- all over Iowa?  <p>

		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN:</b>  Yes.  Yes, you have my
permission.<p>

		(Laughter)  <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  -- Iowa.<p>

		COMMISSIONER KLECKNER:  It's been a --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Is there something going on in
Iowa that we ought to know about?<p>

		COMMISSIONER KLECKNER:  The corn is growing
good, and I sell -- I'm a corn and soybean hog raiser
and sell hogs.  And Herman buys some of them to put in
the topping of Godfather's Pizza that we're going to
eat this noon.<p>

		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN:</b>  That's right.<p>

		COMMISSIONER KLECKNER:  You're going to be
eating my pork this noon from my farm in northern Iowa,
Jack.<p>

		This has been a great panel.  And small
business and farmers come next, and that's also small
business.  And that's the backbone of this country.<p>

		We're hearing about the mega, the Disney and
the ABC merger now.  But you know, the real jobs are
being created by the Herman Cains and all of you and
the small business.<p>

		Just a comment.  My farm -- I made -- Mr.
Hayes, I made tax decisions, as farmers still do,
rather than economic decisions.  The years we had the
investment tax credit by buying or not buying at the
end of the year.  <p>

		Now that we've lost income-averaging, farmers
and, I think, probably some small business, too, I'll
bet you Mr. Thom and his irrigation business, it goes
up and down some years.  But at least farmers have
tremendous shifts in income.  We've lost income-averaging.  We try to do it ourselves. <p>

		I do it by not selling hogs at the end of the
year, delaying till the next year, A lousy economic
decision, but a tax decision, and either buying or not
buying inputs in the first of the year to try to level
out my own income tax.<p>

		What, as a CPA -- and I presume you may do some
farmers' -- ranchers' returns, what do you -- how do
you assess this?  What do you do?  What do you think
should be done, for example, with the extremes of
income that farmers have?  How would you attempt to
level that out?  One or two things that you'd like to
see done to do that.<p>

		 <b>MR. HAYES:</b>  Well, it is a difficult question,
because whenever somebody asks me a question about a
particular tax issue, I always say, "It depends on the
circumstances."<p>

		And the reason that I say it, again, goes back
to the way the Code is structured, and that not
everyone fits the same idea or the same solution.<p>

		Not having income-averaging -- that went away
several years ago -- not having any kind of way to
balance your income out, I think it -- your question
really answers itself and that that's why you need a
simplification process.<p>

		I don't know if I can answer that question
specifically and say you need to do this or you need to
do that.  <p>

		But I think what you need to look at is say the
way the system is now.  There's almost nothing you can
do other than, like you said, delay the reporting of
the income until next year; spend as much money this
year as you can, even though you might not really want
to, it might not be the best thing to do.  But I think
simplification goes back to the answer.<p>

		If you know every single year -- when we do tax
planning, we sort of plan two years at a time.  And we
say, "Okay.  Let's look at a two-year span instead of a
one-year span.  And let's try to make as many good
decisions as we can within that two-year span to reduce
your tax burden."<p>

		What I would suggest is that if we go to a
simplified system, then that takes that decision out.  <p>

		I think one of the gentlemen said the amount of
money and effort and time that we spend in this, it
could be spent helping you make other types of
decisions that are going to be beneficial in the long
term, because I really think short-term -- tax
decisions are really short-term decisions.  And as a
businessperson <p>

-- and if you really want to be successful in business,
you have to make long-term decisions. <p>

		So, I think it's more or less tax
simplification is the answer.  I don't have any
specific recommendations that I can give you at this
point.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Thank you.<p>

		(End tape 1, side 1)<p>

		MR. FARIS:  -- amounts to an inheritance tax
bill change, to change the death tax, make it a $4.2
million exclusion, and all taxes above that will be cut
in half from the current rates, which we are supporting
and applauding.  It's one of NFIB's targets for this
year.<p>

		How important is it to you, in our tax reform
look, to deal with estate taxes and to tax that day --
the capital gains tax the day you sell your business? 
How critical is that to you in terms of priorities for
us, in this Commission?<p>

		And I'd ask any of you who feel motivated to
answer that.<p>

		MR. <b>MR. THOM:</b>  Well, we spend a lot of time, since
my years is 70 years of age, trying to figure out how
we're going to be able to pass the business down.  And
many of our decisions are now made on that basis,
rather than on a good business judgment.  <p>

		And it's -- you know, I think estate tax is
more regressive than any tax that there is, because it
kills the goose that laid the golden egg.<p>

		And government -- it should be look at that. 
If you kill the goose, you get a big chunk right then,
but you don't get any from then on.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Jerald, do you want to make a
comment? <p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  Yes, a quick comment. <p>

		Professionals, by and large, do not build much
equity.  It's a service business, and there's not a lot
that you can convert.  <p>

		But you asked me how important it is.  Nebraska
is a small business state.  I like the state.  And we
have farmers and ranchers and small business, and it's
critical to me and my family that people like Mr. Thom
have relief.<p>

		There's an article in today's Wall Street
Journal, concerning the Dole bill, about estate tax
relief.  I just thought I would quote one thing, which
I did in my written testimony.  It's about the attitude
of federal bureaucrats on taxes.<p>

		A Treasury official praises the idea of estate
tax relief for small family businesses, but says the
Dole bill -- and I quote -- "gives away too much money
to the very rich."<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes. <p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  It's as if it's their money to
give back. <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Right.<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  That's the problem.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Well said.  <p>

		Now, Allan Reynolds, chief research economist
for the Commission, reminded me that the estate tax
only raises $12 billion or so for the federal
government.  And it isn't a question of raising money
as much as it is punitive in nature.  <p>

		And each and every one of you -- I agree with
Jack Faris -- has been passionate about the subject of
how to grow this economy. And you can't do it by
confiscating the estate and the farm or the business of
the individual.<p>

		Loretta -- Commissioner Adams.  <p>

		COMMISSIONER ADAMS:  Thank you, Chairman.<p>

		Listening to all of you is very inspirational,
because I, too, am a small business owner.  <p>

		And I would like to see the outcome of this
Commission, as the title says, focus on economic growth
as well as tax reform, and want to be able to devote
much more of my energy to growing my company, rather
than see what I do with my taxes. <p>

		And one person just said -- and I remember
sitting with the accountant at the end of every fiscal
year -- "No, I'm not going to close those projects till
next year.  I don't care if the company looks larger on
paper.  I don't want to pay those taxes this year."<p>

		One of the things I've heard throughout here,
through the testimony, has to do with fairness.  And
some of you alluded to what you meant by "fairness."  <p>

		But you, in particular, Mr. Hayes, said
"fairness" at the very beginning.  And what do you mean
by "fairness" in the Tax Code as you envision it?<p>

		<b>MR. HAYES:</b>  Well, my perspective on fairness is
that if a person is doing things to grow their
business, to enhance their wealth, positive efforts
that the tax system be fair to that individual.  <p>

		It wasn't so much relative to one group of
people versus another, or a certain income level versus
another.  It was I need to feel, like, if I'm doing --
if I'm playing the game, if I'm doing it right, if I'm
playing fair as a business person, then the government
is fair with me and not taking away my incentive to do
so.  And I think that's what I meant by "fairness."  <p>

		It wasn't so much relative to different people,
but relative to my own particular situation.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Well said.<p>

		Ted.	<p>

		COMMISSIONER FORSTMANN:  Yes, I was very taken
by what all of you said.  <p>

		And I have a question which maybe we could just
have everybody answer yes or no.  <p>

		And the basic question is going to be:  	
	If we could construct something that really didn't
have the government involved in citizens' decision-making at all, would you be in favor of it?<p>

		And I want to take two examples of things that
-- one that Mr.  Abramson said and one that Mr. Hayes
said.<p>

		Who is not in favor of charities, for example? 
Who is not?<p>

		(No response)<p>

		COMMISSIONER FORSTMANN:  But I think it's --
you know, it comes down to a couple of things.  <p>

		First of all, the churches did pretty well
before 1916 --<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  That's right.<p>

		COMMISSIONER FORSTMANN:  -- number one.<p>

		And who is not in favor of saving?  Except as
Shirley and I were talking up here, we're very much in
favor of saving, except, quite honestly, we would begin
to get concerned if we saved too much, because there is
such a thing as too much savings.  <p>

		So, who's going to do all that, you know, the
guys that you're complaining about?  <p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		You see?<p>

		And so, you know, it seems to me -- I don't
want to give a speech here, but it seems to me that
we've, pretty much all of us, lived in a period of
history where we have a model in our heads that has
this stuff in it.  <p>

		And we are opposed the bureaucrats pushing us -- I'm going to point left -- this way.  We kind of are
in favor of this.  But do you really want them pushing
you that way or pushing -- okay.  <p>

		So, my question is really this.  Would you all
say yes or no.  Would you trust the market if we
devised a completely -- which isn't very hard to do, by
the way.  It takes about three or four sentences.  <p>

		If we devised a tax system which was fair,
simple, and completely neutral with respect to these
choices, no charitable deduction, no push for savings,
no nothing, just people make up their own minds and you
had a relatively low rate, high teens, low 20 percents,
or whatever, would you be in favor of that or not?<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Yes, I would.  Probably.<p>

		COMMISSIONER FORSTMANN:  Probably.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  And if the government is going to
collect it, they're going to have to be involved in it
some way.<p>

		COMMISSIONER FORSTMANN:  No, but they're not
going to be involved in --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  In making decisions.<p>

		COMMISSIONER FORSTMANN:  -- making decisions. 
It's going to be neutral.  Whether you save or what you
do is up to you?<p>

		<b>MR. HAYES:</b>  More than likely, yes. <p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Yes.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Yes.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  That's a flat tax you're talking
about, isn't it, Ted?<p>

		COMMISSIONER FORSTMANN:  It's a flat tax with
no -- <p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Yes, with none.<p>

		COMMISSIONER FORSTMANN:  -- no pushing you in
any direction.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  I'd be in favor of that.  Yes.<p>

		COMMISSIONER FORSTMANN:  Thank you.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Leave it to Forstmann to come
up with the conclusion of our Commission. <p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		We've got to have more hearings, Ted.  I mean,
we can't --<p>

		COMMISSIONER FORSTMANN:  Go home, John.  	
	<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  It's over.<p>

		COMMISSIONER FORSTMANN:  -- off, John.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  No, that really was a profound
point, that savings and charitable contributions -- if
the rates are low, and I keep saying to people, "Argue
with me."  And I'm easy to argue with.  <p>

		I said, "Look, if the rate is low enough, and
you're guaranteeing that there would have to be some
lid on spending and on the ability of Congress to
change it willy-nilly, capriciously, wouldn't you be
willing to give up that little twist in the Tax Code
for a very low rate and, as Ted said, in peacetime?<p>

		I don't know in peacetime there has ever been a
tax system that has worked effectively to grow the
economic and to raise revenue, which is the purpose of
a tax system.  <p>

		I don't even know of anything in peacetime that
has ever been above -- effectively above 20 or 25
percent, think.  But we're getting the cart before the
horse, but that's a very profound point.  	<p>

		We thank you for your direct answer.  First
time I've ever heard a panel say yes or no --<p>

		(Laughter) <p>

		-- follow instructions so well.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  John Wieland -- Commissioner
Wieland.<p>

		COMMISSIONER WIELAND:  Well, I'd like to have
another vote.  And this vote would be similar.  But I'd
like to have you speak on behalf of your friends who
have not appeared before this panel and may not be as
educated about the issues.<p>

		And the question would be:  Do you think your
friends would be willing to give up their mortgage
interest tax deduction and their charitable
contributions in order to have a completely neutral low
rate, or would they prefer to have a slightly higher
rate and keep those two items?<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Want me to start?<p>

		COMMISSIONER WIELAND:  Yes, we'll start with
you.<p>

		<b>MR. HAYES:</b>  I'll go back to the question that
Herman asked me, and I think if people -- if my friends
understood that the system was simple and that everyone
was being treated fairly, I think they would be willing
to give up the mortgage interest deduction.<p>

		COMMISSION WIELAND:  Where do you think they
are today?  <p>

		<b>MR. HAYES:</b>  Where they are today, they don't
understand the system.  So, therefore, I think not.<p>

		Right now, if you were to ask the majority of
my friends, they would probably say, "No, I'm not
willing to give up the mortgage interest deductions. 
I'm not willing to give up the charitable
contribution."<p>

		But I think if you put forth a simplified
version that one could understand, I think people
understanding that, then, would be much more apt to
give that up.  But it has to be  in that regard.<p>

		MR. <b>MR. THOM:</b>  I think the answer to that is, if
you come out with a tax broom, you took last year's
taxes and you paid less taxes, they're going to be for
it.  Going to pay more taxes, they're going to be
against it.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Any other quick comment?   <p>

		<b>Mr. HENRY:</b>  We had this discussion yesterday in
my office when I was debating whether I was going to
testify today.  <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  You had to debate?<p>

		<b>Mr. HENRY:</b>  Yes, we did.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		And some of my senior associates --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Oh.<p>

		<b>Mr. HENRY:</b>  -- said, "Does that mean I'm going
to lose my interest?  And what about the charitables
that I work for?"<p>

		And I think, Mr. Kemp, you said it very, very
well.  You have to explain a low base to make it
understandable.  <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes.<p>

		<b>Mr. HENRY:</b>  That's -- it has to be explained. 
You have a challenge with it right now though.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Commissioner Shirley Peterson,
former Commissioner of the IRS in the Bush
administration, within which I served as well, has
written a recent article that I want to address to both
the Commission itself, as well as to the panel and
anybody else.  But the copy is available.  It was in
The New York Times on Saturday, "Death to the Tax
Code."<p>

		I don't know if those were her words, but it's
really a blessing to our panel and to the Commission to
have Shirley.<p>

		And, Shirley, thank you for being here.<p>

And you're the next questioner.<p>

		COMMISSIONER PETERSON:  Thank you, <p>

Mr. Chairman.<p>

		Gentlemen --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  "Death to the Tax Code."<p>

		COMMISSIONER PETERSON:  (Laughter)<p>

		Gentlemen, you were an absolutely superb panel. 
And I agree with Mr. Faris, we really should take you
on the road.  You were eloquent and right to the point.<p>

		One of the challenges that we will face as we
go forward with our assignment is trying to educate the
American people that it is possible to have both a
simple Tax Code and a fair Tax Code, because so often
in the past it has been argued or it has been assumed
that in order to be fair, it has to be complex; and
that in order to treat everybody precisely the same or
whatever, we have to, you know, create all these tiny
little rules to cover every possible piece of action.<p>

		And also, there has been some view in some
quarters that in order to be fair, that the rates have
to be -- we have to have multiple rates and that the
system has to be progressive.<p>

		So, I regard that as one of our greatest
challenges, and would welcome your views and your help
on how we might educate the American people to
understand that it is possible to have a system that is
simple, that doesn't address every kind of economic
circumstances, and yet it's also fair. <p>

		And I would welcome any comments that any of
you would like to make on that.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  I think one of the difficulties
we have is that the IRS has been one of the causes of a
major distrust of government.  <p>

		And I think that the challenge that the
Commission and the Congress has going forward is to
develop the trust level that when you produce the facts
and explain those, that people actually believe those,
because I think the complexity that has been brought
out of trying to go along with the IRS Code, the good
faith efforts to comply and then still get bounced
cause a huge chasm there that has to be crossed.<p>

		One of the reasons I answered Mr. Forstmann
probably was my concern that changing from shelter to
non-shelter on the employment area without having some
relationship to the perceived cost of those benefits to
the individuals involved is going to be very, very
difficult.  <p>

		So I go back to the answer I gave <p>

Mr. Cain, we have got to get these people to understand
it a lot better. <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Matt Fong, Treasurer of the
State of California, has taken time off from saving
Orange County to be with us today.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		COMMISSIONER FONG:  Yes, I came here to find
some money.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		I'd like to focus on a different area, and
that's on exports.  Nebraska is getting more and more
into exports.  <p>

		I noticed that, Mr. Thom, you export into 12
foreign countries with your irrigation equipment.  <p>

		As the California Treasurer, though, let me
thank you for another export, and that is you provided
the Chargers, the Raiders, and the 49ers with some
great players, here from your football team.  <p>

		But what I'd like to focus on is the earlier
panels have addressed that as foreign companies have
brought their goods into our country, that they are
able to shed their local domestic taxes and the concept
is called border adjustability; but that when we export
our products overseas, that it carries with it a
burden, a tax burden that we cannot shed.  <p>

		And I'm interested in your thoughts, any view
on how that has impacted you, and to the extent that
this is an important part of any kind of tax reform.    <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Leroy.<p>

		MR. <b>MR. THOM:</b>  In the countries that we export, we
always talk about no tariffs -- you know, we're
supposed to be a free nation everywhere.  We only
export to one country that we don't bear a tariff, and
that's Israel.  All of the rest of them are as high
from 7 to <p>

25 percent.<p>

		The other thing that happens with many
countries, like Spain, for instance, anything they
offer to export, the government allows <p>

12 percent, gives them 12 percent of their product --
cost of their product.  And this makes it an unlevel
field.<p>

		It's a long way from a free trade world that we
are dreaming about here in the United States and have
dreamed about for 30 years.  And I don't think it's
ever going to come about.  		Now, maybe I'm wrong,
and I hope I'm wrong.  But I think we -- and I'm not
sure that government -- government just needs to get
off our back --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes.<p>

		MR. <b>MR. THOM:</b>  -- and let us go.  We'll fight some
of these other things.  <p>

		But, you know, in my 40 years in business, I
just can't believe the amount of stuff that comes down
the pike, the amount of people that I've got to have on
the payroll that don't produce anything except for the
government.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes.  Well said.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Just a quick comment. <p>

		The answer to your question directly is yes,
we've got a deal with exports, especially Iowa and
Nebraska, but everybody.  <p>

		But I would make one comment.  Everybody talks
about the front-end load of this, the weight back home
of taxes and so on.  But I think they forget the front-end subsidies that go in to the production of whatever
is going overseas.<p>

		As you recall, America was not in GATT for
agriculture back -- originally, because the Americans
did not want agriculture covered with GATT.<p>

		So, I would, as you address this, which I hope
you do, be sure and look at the very strong political
problems dealing with the various front-end subsidies,
one country versus another, and see how we can smooth
the understanding of those out so that we can let Mr.
Thom sell his stuff without being beaten up on, which
he is right now.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  And in the interest of time,
it's -- the next panel should get prepared.<p>

		I want to thank the panel on behalf of our
Commission.  <p>

		Let me tell my fellow Commissioners, several of
the panelists either rearranged or changed -- or maybe
didn't give up, but made significant changes in their
vacation plans here in August.  <p>

		And we really appreciate -- not just the
passion, but the erudite, thoughtful, empirical,
personal evidence that you have brought before this
Commission.  <p>

		You've recharged us with the energy that never
flags, but sometimes it slows down a little bit.  <p>

		And I think Mr. Faris put it best, in thanking
each and every one of you for being here.    <p>

		Thanks, Frank and Leroy and --<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Great job.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  -- William and Dick and Jerald
with a J and Jeff with a G.<p>

		(Applause)	<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes, individuals can take a
break, but I want to move on to our next panel.<p>

		(Brief recess)		<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  That was a non-break.<p>

		(Laughter) 		<p>

		Unscheduled, unrehearsed.<p>

		I said there would be no break.  And I sat here
and everybody was gone --<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		-- so it proves the power of leadership.<p>

		(Pause)<p>

		One of the reasons for being in Omaha and so
close to Iowa and in the heartland of America is to get
a perspective from the farm community on tax policy and
economic growth.<p>

		Bob Dole is from Kansas, Dean Kleckner is from
Iowa, and our panelists represent both Nebraska and
Iowa:  <p>

		Bob Bettger of Fairmount, Nebraska. <p>

		(End tape 1, side 2)<p>

		Gary and Jackie Muller of Griswold, Iowa.<p>

		Keith Olsen of Grant, Nebraska.<p>

		Robert Soloth of McClelland, Iowa.<p>

		We're glad you're here.  Thank you very much.  <p>

		Bob, do you want to start off and give us the
benefit of your perspective and wisdom on this issue.  <p>

		And when Gary gets here, we'll go to Gary and
Jackie.<p>

		<b>MR. BETTGER:</b>  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.<p>

		Mr. Chairman and members of the Commission, my
name is Bob Bettger.  I farm at Fairmount, Nebraska.  <p>

		You have a copy of my text, and I will deviate
off that, because that does specifically state Farm
Bureau policy and agriculture's concerns in this area.<p>

		So, I will get right into our specific
situation that my family and I have and how it relates
to our operation and taxes.<p>

		I farm with my father, who is basically retired
now, and two brothers.  And we have an irrigated corn
and soybean farm approximately two hours west of here.<p>

		Over the years, we have accumulated
approximately 3800 acres.  And the last few years, the
biggest thing we've had to plan for is estate taxes and
Social Security taxes and basically just income taxes.	<p>

		And what we've done, we set up three individual
corporations, my brothers and myself, and a general
partnership.  And what that has allowed us to do,
instead of incorporating all the income into one entity
and dividing it out, we have created three separate
entities.  <p>

		We take rents.  It greatly reduces our payments
on Social Security and Medicaid by doing it that way,
trying to also keep the corporations into a lower tax
bracket.<p>

		And as Mr. Kleckner stated, one of the things
we also have to do, because we were hit somewhat in '93
with the excessive rains -- and, as Mr. Cain can
remember, the central part of the state had a very
devastating windstorm go through, and we virtually had
a half a corn crop in '93 -- and without income-averaging, we are forced to adjust our sales
accordingly, hold back some grain from one year
possibly to sell in the next, and things like that just
to help even our tax load if we can from year to year.<p>

		So, I don't know -- there'll probably be some
questions later, but another thing is the health issue. 
That's another primary reason why we've gone to this
method.  We can deduct 100 percent of -- for our
families -- our health premiums and health costs by
doing it that way, also. <p>

		And it's kind of sad, because most of our
fathers and the older generation were brought up, as
you know, agriculture is just a way of life.  And
they've never had to really treat it as a business, the
way we have to today.  <p>

		You know, they were almost out of the old shoe-box method.  You know, they'd fill the bins up and sell
corn whenever they needed to.  But unfortunately now it
is strictly a business and for a lot of reasons,
because of taxes, and this is the way we have to
operate our farms.<p>

		COMMISSIONER KLECKNER:  Thank you, Bob.	<p>

		In the absence of the Chairman, who said if he
wasn't back -- we want to thank you for being concise,
and there will be questions, I'm sure, for the panel or
comments.<p>

		We'll move now to Gary and Jackie, whichever
one of you wants to start.  <p>

		I've known you for some time.  And welcome to
this Commission hearing, and we're interested in your
comments.<p>

<a name="Muller"></a><center>PRESENTATION BY GARY AND JACKIE MULLER<br>
GRISWOLD, IOWA</center>
<p>
<center>
<Font size="-1"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></Font>
</center><p>


		MR. MILLER:  Thank you, Dean.<p>

		Herman, the first thing I would like to say, if
I was going to create a grassroots groundswell
movement, I'd have you for my spokesman.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		<b>COMMISSION CAIN:</b>  No, but thanks, Gary.<p>

		<b>MR. MULLER:</b>  This is Jackie, with a J.<p>

		Jackie and I would like to thank you, as a
board of Commissioners, for your effort and for your
thought put into this tax reform.<p>

		It's an honor to be here today to represent the
American farmers.  We've helped feed the world, and
we're proud to be part of that.  <p>

		For a country to remain strong, it needs a
safe, dependable, and an abundant food supply.  And we
have provided that.<p>

		But our ag sector is currently being weakened
by a system that is forcing us to make decisions based
on taxation, rather than sound economic principles.<p>

		We're going to speak to three issues today:  <p>

			Capital gains tax.<p>

			Estate tax.<p>

			And payroll taxes.<p>

		In 1869, my great-great-grandfather left
Germany because of political and economic oppression. 
He came to the United States to find greater
opportunity.  When he arrived in Iowa, he bought
farmland.  <p>

		In 1968, 99 years later, Jackie and I purchased
that land.  This land now will have a property tax
higher than the purchase price by several times.  And
this property tax must be paid whether or not we
produce anything on our farm.<p>

		One of the advantages of being a farmer is that
each farm family independently decides what plan best
suits their situation.  <p>

		For our personal situation, what makes the most
economic sense is to intensify our livestock
production. <p>

		 I have developed skills that have put me in a
position to build a world-class hog operation, a 3600-sow unit.  A unit like this will carry a price tag of
about $4 million, but it will still give us a very
favorable return on our investment.<p>

		The farmland that I would have to sell in a
quest for the capital could open up land for three
beginning farmers.  And an added benefit that this
project would give, it would be a ready market for the
grain that they would produce on this land.<p>

		However, the capital gains tax that we would
have to pay would deplete our holdings to the point
that it would be a foolish move.  So, instead of
creating a new economic opportunity for myself and
about 20 new employees, we've put the plans on hold.<p>

		Further, let me point out, if we should elect
to proceed with this project, the dollar amount will be
$2 to $3 million, too large to pass on to our children
because of estate tax.<p>

With the current exemption limit, they simply couldn't
afford to inherit it intact, thus making it difficult
for them to continue the projects that we've started.<p>

		We're not merely interested in surviving out on
the farm; we want to thrive.  But we are unable to make
our decisions based solely on our profit-and-loss
statement.  The tax ramifications have to be high on
our list of considerations.<p>

		Once again, the tentacles of taxation are
reaching through the economic lifeline of my farm and
are killing many projects before they're ever started.<p>

		We have the resources here in the Midwest to be
an effective competitor in a global economy, but the
tax system that inhibits our ability to compete needs
to be rethought.<p>

		Farming is unique from other businesses in our
inability to pass on the cost of taxation.  Farmers
don't set their own prices, and we're at the mercy of
the market because we're unable to hold our products
off the market.  <p>

		Our products are perishable, and we're unable
to hold them off the market to receive higher prices. 
It's not as simple as including higher taxes in the
selling price.  <p>

		Unnecessary taxes are stifling economic growth. 
What's needed is encouragement for myself and other
people like me who are willing to take risks and create
new jobs.  We certainly don't need any new hurdles to
jump over to do these things.  <p>

		Although not like my great-great-grandfather, I
don't plan to flee to another country, but I am turning
down opportunity based on the current tax structure
that my government is imposing on me.<p>

		I appreciate the opportunity to visit with you
this morning and make some brief points.  <p>

		I'd now like to have my better half talk about
payroll taxes.<p>

		<b>MRS. MULLER:</b>  At least you got that part right.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		Good morning.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Good morning, Jackie.<p>

		<b>MRS. MULLER:</b>  Payroll taxes are filled with
complexities.  It must be remembered that unlike the
folks who make the regulations that we live by, farmers
do not have at their disposal a legion of accountants
and lawyers to comply with the payroll and employment
record-keeping.  This is a real burden on the small
businessmen who try to comply and are penalized if they
make a mistake.<p>

		Every payroll check is accompanied by a variety
of computations, partially determined by the marital
status of the recipient, amount of dependents, and
frequency of payment, all requiring different charts.<p>

		Each payroll check has a minimum of six
entries, including federal tax, state tax, unemployment
tax, Social Security and Medicare withholding and the
employer matching amount.<p>

		To untangle the complexities of making out the
payroll, I use a farm accounting computer program and
subscribe to a support service for trouble-shooting.  <p>

		Of course, when I have serious problems, I can
always depend on my concise, east-to-understand --<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		-- Circular A, Agricultural Employees' Tax
Guide to clear things up.<p>

		For example -- I've highlighted a paragraph
here -- in this paragraph, one is referred to five
other publications and requested to complete 11 other
forms, such as the 943, 1099, 1099 Miscellaneous, W-2,
W-3, 940, 940-EZ, just to name a few.<p>

		That's just one paragraph from just one of the
cumbersome publications requesting information that is
almost all redundant in the previous year's monthly
reports.    <p>

		I keep wondering how many forms they had before
the Paperwork Reduction Act.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		Young folks are often scared off completely
when they see the record-keeping requirements involved
in farming.  And often seasoned farmers are simply
hiring additional help in order to save the recurring
problems connected with payroll.  They are refusing to
grow because of that extra burden.    <p>

		Others are a little more creative.  Some hire
workers but call them contract labor, leaving the
details of reporting up to the workers' discretion.  Or
there are those who simply pay with cash or goods, such
as grain and livestock, and forget the deductions and
reporting altogether.<p>

		Once again, Gary and I applied your efforts to
make our tax system flatter, fairer, and simpler and, I
might add, hopefully filled with some common sense.<p>

		Not only will it help to ease the burden on the
small businessperson, but in so doing, will stimulate
economic growth.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Here, here.<p>

		<b>MRS. MULLER:</b>  Thank you.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Thank you.  Thank you.<p>

		(Applause)<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Sitting ovation.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		Thank you, both Jackie and Gary.<p>

<a name="Olsen"></a><center>PRESENTATION BY KEITH OLSEN<br>
GRANT, NEBRASKA</center>
<p>
<center>
<Font size="-1"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></Font>
</center><p>


		<b>MR. OLSEN:</b>  Thank you.<p>

		I am happy to have the opportunity to come
before you today and give you a farmer's perspective on
concerns that I have about our federal tax system.  <p>

		I have a dry-land farm in southwest Nebraska,
about 350 miles straight west of here.  I raise about
1300 acres of wheat and about 300 acres of corn
annually.<p>

		Also, I prepare tax returns -- have a business
in the wintertime -- and provide tax services for many
farmers, ranchers, and businesses.<p>

		I'm also a member of the Nebraska Farm Bureau
Board of Directors.<p>

		As this Commission presents recommendations, I
hope they take into concern this uniqueness that
farmers and ranchers have that may not be as important
to other types of taxpayers.<p>

		And I want to just take a couple of minutes to
talk about some of the concerns I have and try not to
duplicate some of the concerns that have already been
presented.<p>

		Farm income is very volatile.  It can go up and
down, and depending mainly upon the weather.  The only
thing consistent about weather in our part of the
state, and for most farmers in the United States, is
that weather is inconsistent.<p>

		A couple of tiny rains in June or a severe
hailstorm in July on my 1300 acres of wheat can put my
income in high tax bracket or at zero.<p>

		And to illustrate that, as we were harvesting
last -- about two weeks ago, a cloud came up and the
combines were in the field.  And about 15 minutes later
some combines didn't need to go back to the field,
because the wheat crop was destroyed by hail.  A
beautiful wheat crop <p>

-- we'd be making $200, $300 per acre gross --was
reduced to zero.  And that had a tremendous effect on
tax planning.<p>

		In 1992, in our area, most of our wheat was
destroyed by a late freeze.  Here again, how do you
plan taxwise when you have such variable income?<p>

		Another area I'd like to touch on is farmers
getting reading to retire.  I've had a friend who
retired this -- at the end of '94.  He planted his last
wheat crop in '94, which he harvested here in '95.  <p>

		He had an equipment sale and sold his
machinery.  He had no expenses in '95; he just had his
income.  So, he's going to be in a big tax bracket.  <p>

		And he found out, when he sold his equipment,
that he had a partner in his farm business.  <p>

		He bought his equipment with his own money.  He
maintained that equipment.  He made the payments on it
if he bought it on time.  He paid personal property tax
on part of it, which we have in Nebraska.  He paid the
sales tax on part of it.  He paid the insurance on it.  <p>

		But when he sold it last spring, he had a
partner, and that partner took one-third of his
machinery, just like a thief in the night coming out
and taking part of the equipment away.<p>

		And this is money that my friend was going to
use to retire on.  And one-third of it, approximately,
went to the government, both federal and state.<p>

		We did have -- prior years, we did have income
tax averaging.  That would have helped my friend,
because he would have got some of that income into a
lower tax bracket.  But we no longer have that.<p>

		Another real problem that has been touched on a
little bit -- we cannot emphasize it enough -- is the
capital gains tax due when a farmer wants to sell his
land.  <p>

		And here again, a lot of farmers have a small
tax base, bought the land years and years ago.  And we,
since then, have had much inflation in the price of
land.  And the government has just, you know, taken an
awful lot of income off of that land as tax.  <p>

		And that's going to affect me.  I'm not quite
ready to retire, but I'm getting to the age where I
need to start thinking about retirement and making my
plans.  <p>

		I had three boys.  Is one of my boys going to
come back to farm?  If he does, how do I transfer the
farm to him?<p>

		And a big concern is the tax issue.  You know,
it isn't a question of is the farm economical, can we
make a living off the farm.  It's a question of how can
you transfer that farm and not pay the government.  And
this is a real, real concern that farmers have to
address.<p>

		And farmers are not just selling assets, mainly
the land and the equipment, because of the taxes.  Some
of them are hanging in farming longer than they want
to.  They're not taking that income -- or that money
they've got invested in land.  <p>

		And to many farmers that's their retirement
plan.  They don't have a 401(k) or a Keogh Plan or
whatnot.  They put their money back into the land and
equipment, and that's what they wanted to retire on. 
And now the government takes so much of it.<p>

		Finally, I'd like to mention one other area of
concern.  As I prepare tax returns -- and a lot of my
farmers are in the $30- to $50,000 income range on a
normal year.  Abnormal years, they're below zero to
maybe $75- or $80,000. <p>

		But for many farmers, my average client in that
$30- to $50,000 range, they will pay more in Social
Security tax than they do in income tax.  And when they
get their tax bill, they don't separate the two.  They
say, "What's my tax bill?"<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes.<p>

		<b>MR. OLSEN:</b>  And then you point out, "Well, this
much is Social Security.  This little bit over here is
the income tax."  <p>

		And, you know, it's a fantastic amount that
goes off -- at a doable farm that has to go to the
government.  And a lot of it is Social Security tax,
the self-employment tax.  		 <p>

		I thank you for giving me an opportunity to
offer some thoughts and viewpoints.  <p>

		And a copy of my testimony was presented to the
Commission.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Great.  Great.  Thanks, Keith.<p>

		Robert Soloth.  Thanks for being here.<p>

		(Pause)<p>

		Can you move?<p>

		That's pretty cumbersome.  We apologize to our
panel.  We should have another microphone.<p>

		(Pause)<p>

		Thank you for being here, sir.<p>

<a name="Soloth"></a><center>PRESENTATION BY ROBERT SOLOTH<br>
McCLELLAND, IOWA</center>
<p>
<center>
<Font size="-1"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></Font>
</center><p>

		<b>MR. SOLOTH:</b>  I appreciate the opportunity to be
able to pass some of my thoughts on to somebody who
maybe will be able to get something done with them.<p>

		My name is Robert Soloth.  My wife, Rosalie,
and my family live near McClelland, Iowa, which is less
than 20 miles east of where we are right now.<p>

		We have four children.  Greg is a December 1944
graduate of Iowa State University and farming with us. 
Dawn is a senior at Simpson College in Indianola,
majoring in elementary education.  Lee Ann is a senior
at Trainor High, and Sarah an eighth grader.  <p>

		We farm 1750 acres in Pottawatomie County, with
1600 acres split between corn and beans and the balance
in set-aside hay and pasture.  We also have a small cow
herd.<p>

		When I was asked to speak before this
Commission, it was suggested I make my comments
primarily on capital gains.  I feel that capital gains
is one of the most unfair taxes we have.  And in my
opinion, in many instances it is a tax on a loss,
rather than a gain.<p>

		In 1966, after I returned from the Army, I
bought a new 1967 Chevy Impala.  It cost me $2500.  The
next summer, a realtor came to me wanting to sell an
80-acre farm in the next section to settle an estate.  <p>

		The price was $450 per acre.  That farm today
would bring about $1400 an acre.  To the IRS, this
would be a $950-per-acre gain, to be taxed at probably
31 percent, or $295 per acre.		<p>

		We just bought a new car last month.  It has a
fancier radio and lots of bells and whistles, but
probably weighs a third less than the '67 Chevy Impala. 
It cost $19,000.  It would have taken 5.5 acres of that
farm in <p>

1967 --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  That's a perfect way of
explaining that.<p>

		<b>MR. SOLOTH:</b>  -- to buy the new car.<p>

		It would take 13.6 acres to buy our new car
today, a 60 percent reduction in buying power.<p>

		But it would also take another <p>

3.6 acres to pay the capital gains tax on the land
sale, making a total loss of buying power of 68
percent.<p>

		In 1968, I bought a new 85 horsepower tractor
for $8500, equal to 18 acres of land.  Today, a
similarly equipped tractor would cost $45,000, or 32
acres of the same land.  This would be a 42 percent
loss in purchasing power.  And after taxing the alleged
gain or inflation, it would take 40 acres, or a 54
percent reduction in actual value.<p>

		To give you one more example, in 1968, my
sister was attending Iowa State University.  Tuition,
room, and board had the phenomenal sum of $800 per
year, or 1.7 acres of that same farm.  <p>

		Last year, when our son graduated from Iowa
State University, the annual cost was $6,000, or 4.3
acres of land, a 61 percent reduction in buying power. 
Or with the capital gains imposed, it would now take
5.4 acres, or a 69 percent reduction in what that acre
would purchase.<p>

		There are situations where it would be best to
sell a farm, but capital gains prevents that from being
economically feasible. <p>

		In 1966, my uncle retired and I rented his
farm.  Things went well until about eight years ago,
when his wife had to be placed in a nursing home.  They
had saved some money and, along with the income of the
farm, were able to pay their bills.<p>

		Two years later, however, my uncle also had to
go to the nursing home.  They were both there together
for about two and a half years, at a cost of nearly
$42,000 per year.<p>

		After my aunt passed away, their money was
gone, along with the operating capital for the farm. 
The farm income, along with his Social Security, will
not cover the nursing home costs for my uncle.  So, the
farm has been mortgaged to make ends meet.  <p>

		As there are no heirs interested in operating
the farm, it would be best of the farm were sold, since
there is no money for repairs or soil conservation
work.  <p>

		However, because my uncle acquired the farm in
the 1930s, his basis in the farm was only $110 per
acre.  The capital gains would take nearly one-third of
the sale price.  In this situation, indexing of capital
gains would certainly not be a tax break for the rich,
as some in the media and Congress would have us
believe.  <p>

		Indexing of capital gains for inflation would
be beneficial for the farm economy, because it would
make more farmland available to young farmers.  It
would put cash into the marketplace or into lending
institutions where it could be loaned for expansion and
capital improvements.  <p>

		There would be more willingness to invest in
agriculture if people knew their investment would not
be punished with a regressive capital gains tax.   <p>

		Thank you.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes.  <p>

		Let me say, on behalf of the Commission, we've
had testimony for several weeks, and all of it has been
good.  All of it has been essential to the work of this
Commission.<p>

		And I would not be disrespectful to the
wonderful contribution that Keith Olsen and Jackie and
Gary and Bob have made.<p>

		But, Robert, may I say, as the son of a small
businessman -- my daddy was a truck driver and turned
it into a trucking company -- but whether it's trucks
or farming or widget-making or producing bread or wine
or a service, no one has yet testified to this
Commission in such an eloquent fashion on the basic
ingredient of a free market or free enterprise economy,
that you must judge the value of an enterprise not by
some abstraction.  		<p>

		You have brought it down from the abstract to
the empirical, the objective, the historical, the
personal, the family, the real.  		And on behalf of
all of us, and myself in particular, I really want to
thank all of you -- but you particularly -- talking
about acreage and what it would take today to send a
child to college, buy a car, do the things that we, as
Americans, call the American Dream.  <p>

		But it is not American; it is universal.  It is
the universal dream of people everywhere, from South
Africa to the South Bronx, and from East Europe to East
L.A.<p>

		So, that was very, very powerful.  And we're
going to circulate all of your testimony.<p>

		But, Robert, again, it was again, that was a
tremendous contribution to our work.  I really want to
thank you.<p>

		Excuse me for making such a lengthy editorial
comment, but you moved us all.  All of you have, but
that was great.<p>

		The president of the American Farm Bureau,
Commissioner Dean Kleckner.<p>

		COMMISSIONER KLECKNER:  Okay.  Thank you, Jack.<p>

		I would echo what Jack Kemp just said.  And all
of you gave outstanding testimony.  I want to read it
all.<p>

		I can just say amen, or ditto, or whatever, to
all of what you said.  It's what we deal with
constantly in agriculture -- and small business, too,
Herman.  And all of you, it's the same issue.<p>

		Jackie, you particularly -- you talked about
Social Security and Medicare, that tax.  And someone
said that, for farmers, it's often more than the income
tax.  <p>

		I mean -- I guess, Keith, it was you, wasn't
it, as you prepare tax returns? <p>

		How is it affecting all of you?  <p>

		And, you know, Social Security is kind of off
limits politically now.  It's such a touchy issue with
the elderly.  <p>

		And I'm approaching it a lot faster than I
really want to admit, thinking that my mother is 86
years old now, living in Osage, Iowa, on Social
Security and some minor other investments that she
made.  She was a nurse.  <p>

		And our senior citizens worry about Social
Security.  <p>

		And with the media constantly drumming into our
politicians, it almost is off limits to even talk
about.  But heck, I don't care.  I'm going to talk
about it.  I'm going to ask about it.<p>

		What's your view on that?  Is it untouchable? 
Where are we going with it?  What do you think we ought
to do?<p>

		Bob, you're --  <p>

		<b>MR. BETTGER:</b>  Well, one thing that I would like
to talk about on Social Security -- and in 1991, we
were more or less forced to incorporate out business to
avoid some of these taxes.  And I'm sure these other
gentlemen have, too.<p>

		One thing that happens to a farmer as an
individual, when he buys land and he works all of his
life to pay for it, and unless he does something to
incorporate his business otherwise, that land is paid
for, and even though it's an investment -- and the
return from that investment, when he sells grain, it
goes on his 1040-F.  And he pays Social Security on the
return from the investment in that farm, because it's
all included in his 1040-F.<p>

		And it has forced anybody with any acreage or
who owns any land to incorporate or to some way get
around that.  <p>

		But as far as Social Security, I'm <p>

50 years old, and if I could opt out of it now, I sure
would.  <p>

		<b>MRS. MULLER:</b>  I would like to speak to that,
because whenever I write out a payroll check, about
one-third of the -- well, okay, to give an example, if
a man earns $1,000 approximately, he receives about
$800, but I send to the government the extra $200.  <p>

		So, to me, that man costs me $1200, but he's
only making $800 -- taking home $800, I mean.  I don't
think that sounds fair to either one of us.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes.<p>

		<b>MRS. MULLER:</b>  And the biggest comment that I
hear from virtually everyone is "We're sending this in,
but it won't be there when we get there anyway."<p>

		That is just a universal comment, I believe.<p>

		And like Mr. Soloth, I believe we'd all just be
glad to get rid of it.  Like many of our other
government programs, I think it probably started out as
a very good idea, to help people with catastrophic
problems that hadn't, for some reason, been able to
save for their retirement.<p>

		One thing, it has just simply gone awry.  We're
giving people -- not only are they getting a living,
but cost-of-living increases?  		Pardon me, but as
a farmer, I don't get a cost-of-living increase.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		I could probably -- <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  No, that's --<p>

		<b>MRS. MULLER:</b>  -- take the entire forum to talk
about Social Security taxes, so I'll just pass.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Well, no.  You made a powerful
case for the explanation of the wedge <p>

-- that is, the gap between what a worker gets to take
home in his or her paycheck and what the employer must
pay to get his or her work done --i.e., labor.  <p>

		And the wider the wedge, the more frustration,
the employer vis-a-vis the worker.  And that's what
this whole issue is about.  Reducing the wage lowers
the cost of labor and brings more employment, brings a
broader tax base.  <p>

		So, that -- hearing it from you, I think --
everybody says, "Oh, economics is so difficult."  <p>

		Nonsense.  It is common sense.  <p>

		I think Keith Olsen said, "I hope you approach
this with common sense."  That is just a commonsense
approach to taxation.<p>

		Loretta.  And then Herman Cain.<p>

		COMMISSIONER ADAMS:  You mentioned, Jackie,
there were six deductions on your payroll check.  If
I'm reading mine correctly, it's either five or seven;
I'm not sure.<p>

		<b>MRS. MULLER:</b>  Well, I said a minimum of six.<p>

		COMMISSIONER ADAMS:  Okay.<p>

		I hear a recurring theme and concern here, and
that is with capital gains and estate taxes.<p>

		If the world were ideal, how do you all see
that as taking shape or form and having to change?<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  It appears to me that capital
gains is just a tax that is regressive.  It's not
making sense.  It's causing us to do things out here on
the farm that we should not be doing.  <p>

		If we're going to remain strong as a country --
and I think that this is a key issue, that has to be
addressed.  If we're not going to stay strong as a
country, if we're not going to be able to lead the
world in the things that we're doing, it's not going to
be very long before we're not going to be able to take
care of many of the other problems.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Keith.  <p>

		<b>MR. OLSEN:</b>  I'll speak up.  I think most people
would be willing to pay maybe some capital gains tax,
but not at the rate it is today, which is 28 percent, I
think, maximum.<p>

		I don't think we are trying to avoid taxes; we
just don't want to pay an exorbitant amount.  And if
the capital gains comes under the flat tax, if that's
what the proposal is and it's taxed similar to other
property, that may be acceptable.  <p>

		It's kind of hard to talk about exactly where
you want to be at until you see some definite figures.<p>

		But it does hurt the economy.  There's no doubt
about it.  If farmers don't sell <p>

land --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Right.   <p>

		<b>MR. OLSEN:</b>  -- whatever it may be -- if they
don't sell -- people don't sell stock, because too much
money will be lost.   <p>

		So, it is just way too high.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Keith. <p>

		<b>MR. OLSEN:</b>  I'll speak up.<p>

		I think most people would be willing to pay
maybe some capital gains tax, but not at the rate it is
today, which is 28 percent, I think, of maximum.<p>

		I don't think we are trying to avoid taxes.  We
just don't want to pay an exorbitant amount.  And if
the capital gains comes under the flat tax, if that's
what the proposal is, and it's taxed similar to other
property, that may be acceptable.<p>

		It's kind of hard to talk about exactly where
you want to be at until you see some definite figures.<p>

		But it does hurt the economy.  There's no doubt
about it.  If farmers don't sell <p>

land --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Right.	<p>

		<b>MR. OLSEN:</b>  -- whatever it may be, if they
don't well -- people don't sell stock because too much
money will be lost.<p>

		So, it is way too high.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Commissioner Cain.<p>

		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN:</b>  Mr. Bettger, <p>

Mr. Muller, Mrs. Muller, Mr. Soloth, Mr. Olsen, I don't
have a question.  I have a comment.<p>

		I don't think you realize how impactful (sic)
you've been here in what you had to say today -- will
have not only on what we ultimately recommend, but what
your comments have done to inspire all of us in facing
the challenges that we are going to face, trying to
deliver your message in -- with the same amount of
passion and conviction that you have displayed here
today.  <p>

		And I sincerely want to thank you, because
you've -- as Jack indicated earlier, when we all took
our schedules, and Jack said, "Okay, now take your
current schedule, and you're going to squeeze an extra
meeting in there, an extra trip a week for the next six
months," you have energized me personally with your
message and your comments and your situation.  <p>

		And I don't think you really realize how
impactful (sic) it has been or will be in ultimately
what we attempt to do with respect to the
recommendation of this Commission.  <p>

		So, I just want to thank you.  I don't have a
question.  i just thank you for taking the time and
sharing your comments.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Mr. Faris.<p>

		COMMISSIONER FARIS:  Mine was a '67 Chevy
Impala, two-door --	<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		-- with a black vinyl top, emerald green.  I
wish I had that car back.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		Now, I should have bought it where you did,
because I remember paying more money for it at the time
than you did, because I still remember that bill.  <p>

		But I also realize that when I went to school
and what my son's college is costing me today, I dream
of one day having that much money.  And now it's paying
it per year.<p>

		Very impactful (sic) in terms of relating that
to your business.  I think words are very important.  <p>

		And the words you're using and how you're
framing the issue go back to one of the big challenges
that we have, and that's communication.<p>

		What are the real problems?  And what are the
real solutions?<p>

		The payroll tax -- your example of showing us,
Jackie, the booklet and forms that you have to go by
and how inane all this is.<p>

		But the payroll tax issue that Dean Kleckner
brought up, that we've talked about, I keep hearing
from small business owners, not just in this area, not
just on farms and ranches, but small businesses around
the country, from a priority standpoint.  <p>

		How do you feel about this Commission and our
charge to look at taxes from the federal government and
our charge -- should we be looking at payroll taxes and
the impact of the payroll tax, since more small
business owners around America pay more money in
payroll tax than they do in income tax?<p>

		Well, how do you -- not just you, Jackie, but
the others, you're the ones who have to see it every
day in making out these six entries.  How do you feel
about that whole issue vis-a-vis what we're going?   <p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Well, in your earlier panel, they
were talking about how to communicate to the general
public about the change in the tax law.  <p>

		And I think if they would totally eliminate tax
withholding and the IRS can open an office in the post
office -- but if everybody had to go write a check
every week or every month for their taxes, there would
be a whole lot more awareness in this country of how
much it takes.  And it would also take a big load off
small business.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Well, I'd also like to point out
that one of the problems that we have with our
government is the amount of spending that we have.  And
part of that is because of the huge bureaucracy that we
have created.<p>

		I think government could take a lesson from
agriculture.  If they could have improved their
productivity at the rate farmers have improved their
productivity, three out of four of them wouldn't have a
job.<p>

		<b>MRS. MULLER:</b>  I'd like to speak to the concern
about getting the message across -- and I bet I'll get
a nod of every head up there when I say that the media
does not portray what is happening and what needs to be
done accurately.  It just doesn't come to us with a
slant, but it really should.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Well, let me <p>

encourage --<p>

		<b>MRS. MULLER:</b>  I think that's a big problem that
you have.  I don't see how you can sell this if you
have to go through the media to do it.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  That's a great point.<p>

		And I'll tell you, when we listen to panels and
listen to the eloquence of -- the crispness of your
testimony, it's penetrating.  As Herman said, it
excites us and encourages us.<p>

		Let me please urge and recommend that you write
letters to the editors, to cut through some reporting
that's done or not done, and encourage you to be
willing to come testify, to be willing to speak up and
speak out more, because, quite frankly, as a
Commission, we can just say and do so much and it will
be pictured and framed a certain way.  <p>

		But what you're doing every day, from your
farm, ranch, and business, to communicate is extremely
important.<p>

		I just want to encourage you, for your
testimony, not only to us today, but don't lose your
voice.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Great.<p>

		John - Commissioner Wieland.  Question?<p>

		COMMISSIONER WIELAND:  Mr. Bettger said that he
had created several corporations to, you know, deal
with the issues that are out there.  And I wonder if
the rest of you -- is that what you have done, and is
that what other farmers have done generally?<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  We have not incorporated our
farm, because whenever we start getting into these
types of organizational changes, you've got to take
into considerations what it's going to do with your tax
bases of your land, how are you going to be able to
take your land back out.  		We visited with a
bunch of lawyers.  You can visit with a bunch of
accountants.  And it's very difficult to figure out
what needs to be done.  And after you're looking at
both issues, I'm not sure which way is the right way. 
And I get tired of paying the accountants and attorneys
trying to advise me.<p>

		<b>MR. BETTGER:</b>  As I mentioned, we did
incorporate our business in 1991, and I felt we were
forced into it.  We were looking at having two kids in
college for three years, and that amounts to more than
I, at one time, would have ever thought I could make.<p>

		When we were looking at trying to raise our
income, we were already at the point -- between
federal, Social Security, and state income taxes, we
were already paying at a rate of about 56 percent.  So,
any new dollar that we took in, we were only going to
be able to keep 44 percent.  <p>

		By incorporating and keeping land out of the
corporation, the corporation rents the land back.  And
we've eliminated the Social Security tax on the
investment that I mentioned earlier, and we are able to
deduct our health care.  <p>

		And there are a few things that it helps, but
it also creates double bookkeeping, it creates legal
fees, and there are also a lot of drawbacks.  <p>

		But like I said, I felt that we were forced
into it, not because we really wanted to do it.  <p>

		PARTICIPANT:  All right.  I incorporated in
1979.  The main reason was for tax management and debt
management. <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Ted.<p>

		COMMISSIONER FORSTMANN:  I'm kind of with
Herman.  I think that people like yourselves are what
America is really all about.<p>

		I just would like to say that I've got
everybody's written testimony here, except Gary and
Jackie Muller.  <p>

		And if you could get it written up --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes.<p>

		COMMISSIONER FORSTMANN:  -- it would be great
for me, because I think there are places we can put
this and incorporate it.  <p>

		And I was particularly taken by something Gary
said.<p>

		About your great-grandfather (sic), <p>

I guess.  He left Germany for a reason.  And I don't
believe that what we're talking about here is really
economics.  There is nothing -- there is no economics
in favor of the kind of looney things that you people
are forced to do.  There's no such thing as it.  <p>

		We're really talking about civics.  We're
talking about essentially two ways of looking at how
life should be lived.  One is where the state is kind
of preeminent.  And the other is where the person is
kind of preeminent.<p>

		And to make a long story short, your
grandfather (sic) left Germany because at that time the
state was very preeminent.  There <p>

was a -- <p>

		And if we don't get things right here, that's
really what you're talking about.  You're all forced to
do this crazy stuff, thinking about incorporating, not
incorporating -- this, that and the other -- for what
reason?  <p>

		Nobody on this side of the fence and nobody on
this side of the fence has been able to come up with
any reason at all except that the state interferes in
your lives.<p>

		And so we really ought to try.  I'm with
Herman.  We all are donating time and a lot.  And I'm
glad we are, because without people like you, there
isn't going to be anything worth doing here.<p>

		Thank you.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  That is a very important point
to anybody who is listening.<p>

		All of these men and women are busy.  They're
all independent, other than Fong, who represents the
taxpayers of the State of California.  But everybody
has paid their own way, as they do.  We're not
government-funded.  <p>

		Everybody brings their enthusiasm and their
passion to this job, because we believe the country
cannot go into the 21st century without addressing the
issues that you have brought to us.  <p>

		So, you can rest assured that you have a
megaphone through this Commission.  And as Ted said,
this Nation could not have been founded nor can it go
forward, without becoming, once again, the land of
opportunity.<p>

		Matt, do you want to ask a question?  Then
we'll wrap it up. <p>

		COMMISSIONER FONG:  I will say, Jack, that I'm
now like everybody else, because California didn't pass
its budget yet, so I'm not getting paid, also.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  I'll take up a collection.<p>

		COMMISSIONER FONG:  Yes, the hat going around
is mine.  <p>

		Yes, all the elected officials in California
are not getting paid till the budget is out, which is
fine.  It'll put pressure us to get this through.<p>

		California, like Nebraska and Iowa, or other
farm belt states, has a big agricultural community.  <p>

		I'm concerned about the next-generation farmer. 
And one of the things that you've all touched upon is
the generational transfer.<p>

		The farmers that I was able to talk to said
that it is an issue of, like, big versus small.  It's
just -- farming is just a tough business.<p>

		I'm interested in your perspective of to what
extent, when the next generation is talking about
either becoming farmers or inheriting the farm, are
taxes part of that decision?  <p>

		Is it a big part?  Is it a small part?  What is
the thought process?<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Bob, do you want to respond?<p>

		<b>MR. BETTGER:</b>  Yes, I was going to just
reiterate what the previous panel said about fairness. 
I think whatever concept you have to put forward from
this panel's perspective, it would be better perceived
and better accepted if they knew that it was going to
be fair, because Mr. Muller over here, in his tax
situation, has to compete against Murphy Farms.  <p>

		And so whatever you do for those people, he
doesn't necessarily want to compete with them. I think
he probably could, but as long as there's a fairness
issue there.<p>

		And the same way over here, like the
Continentals and Cargills and the -- on the grain side
of it.  I mean, whatever you put together, as long as
it's going to be fair, I think it would be acceptable.<p>

		But that's basically what we've got to compete
against anymore.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Any other?  <p>

		Gary.<p>

		<b>MR. MULLER:</b>  I'd like to address the issue of
big versus small.<p>

		A friend of mine just returned from Georgia,
the country of Georgia.  And there they are starting to
divide their country up into private enterprise.  And
one of the things that they're trying to set up is
create farm land that the individual owns.  <p>

		But what they're trying to set up is about two
hectare plots per person.  That's about five acres.<p>

		What five acres is going to do for those people
is going to guarantee that they are going to be
peasants the rest of their life.<p>

		And as I stated in my testimony, we're not out
here just trying to survive and create a subsistence
life.  <p>

		We don't need to be looked at as second class
citizens as a group of farmers.  We're going to be out
here, and we're going to survive all right.  <p>

		But we're going to thrive, and we're going to
do a good job of it.  And unfortunately, we have
tremendous frustrations and other problems that we have
dealing with the government in getting our job
accomplished.<p>

		MS. MULLER:  I hope if we've accomplished
nothing else today, that we've possibly dispelled the
myth that farmers are hayseeds.<p>

		I think this panel has done an eloquent job of
speaking.  I'm really proud to be on it.<p>

		I want to speak to the issue of making things
simpler.  We're not simple people, and we don't
necessarily need things simpler.  But we just want
things to make common sense.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes.<p>

		MS. MULLER:  And one of the things, for me, is
inheritance tax.  To me, I see absolutely no
justification for inheritance tax, other than we need
to grease the wheels of an already too cumbersome
government.<p>

		If we didn't have this inheritance tax problem
or the capital gains problem that it poses, I think a
lot of land would free up.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes.<p>

		MS. MULLER:  But if the people that are holding
it are in nursing homes, like he's talking about,
passing it on to their children who are 70 years old or
so, and it's not getting freed up for some of these
younger farmers that you're talking about that want to
get started in farming, a lot of the problem is our
land is simply not available to be farmed by the young
farmers.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Our next is going to
address this whole issue.  <p>

		We've got Patrick Hendershott from <p>

Ohio State University, and Robert Genetski, <p>

Bob Genetski; George Zodrow; and John Anderson <p>

-- all of whom are economists and experts on tax
policy.<p>

		And I know they'll remind us of something that
came from a simple, yet profound, farming career and
life, which is that you either have a Tax Code that
redistributes wealth, or you have a Tax Code that
allows wealth to be created.<p>

		And Forstmann asked the question rhetorically
about how this happened.  It grew.  		But it grew
because, in my opinion, having been in the Congress for
so long, 18 years from Buffalo, New York, there are two
kinds of politics.  <p>

		There is the politics of envy and the politics
of egalitarian -- not egalitarian reward, but
egalitarian opportunity.  I think that's what democracy
really is.<p>

		And envy and fear that someone is going to get
rich is what has added to the complexity of the Tax
Code in my opinion.<p>

 		There would be no estate tax.  There is no
earthly reason to tax someone's income, tax it again in
a dividend, tax it again on a capital gain or risk, tax
it again at death.<p>

		I hope their panel can come up with a simple,
single source of tax.  Not judging the outcome, but all
of us are passionate in our belief.<p>

		I would make one other point about the press. 
Reagan proved, I think, once and for all that good
economics is good politics, without suggesting that
everything was perfect.  <p>

		I think it was clear that he got attacked --
left and probably right -- for trying to reduce tax
rates and regulations and to strengthen the currency
back in the early '80s.  <p>

		And it overcame the hostility of the press.  It
drove the press crazy that Ronald Reagan could win the
presidency of the United States on a program of getting
America moving again.  <p>

		And incidentally, that's what John F. Kennedy
did in the early '60s, and that's how a lot of people
really approach this issue.  <p>

		How can we make America grow by allowing
farmers to farm, businessmen and women to produce
widgets, and people to save?<p>

		I am -- well, I think all of us very much
appreciate the simple, yet profound, message of this
panel.  We're going to make sure that your testimony is
spread a lot wider than just our panel.  And we will be
your megaphone, because we believe you are the heart of
the American Dream.<p>

		And before we go to the next panel, I would
like to suggest, since my instructions were not carried
with regard to the first <p>

break --		<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		-- could we keep the second break to <p>

10 minutes, be back here at 11:15.  And then we'll wrap
up the last session about 12-ish.  		So, we'll
have 45 minutes with our last panel, maybe more with
the press conference -- press availability at 12:10.<p>

		Thank you so much, Jackie, Gary, Bob.<p>

<center>"Tax Restructuring and Financial Markets" </center>
<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  Okay.  Thanks.  <p>

		It's a pleasure to be here.<p>

		Okay.  Let me tell you, first of all, I'm going
to be talking primarily as an economist, but also I
can't help but to talk as a small businessman --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Right.<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  -- because I do have my own
company as well.<p>

		And as an economist, most of my work has been
associated with research on the tax system and its
effect on the economy, as well as on the tax system and
its effect on financial markets.<p>

		And I want to touch on three areas:  <p>

			One, the abuse in the current tax system.<p>

			Second, what should not be done in the way
of reform.<p>

			And third, what should be done in the way
of reform.<p>

		First of all, in terms of the current tax
system, there is no doubt that it's inefficient, it's
wasteful, it's destructive, it promotes abuse, and it
undermines family values.<p>

		It has got a lot of costs associated with it. 
Some are obvious, and they've been mentioned before. 
And some are not so obvious.<p>

		Among the fairly obvious costs are the costs of
compliance and administration.  And the figures there
are pretty astounding, about <p>

$150 billion, bare minimum, in terms of cost of
compliance and administration.<p>

		And if we divide that by the number of workers,
we're talking about $1200 per worker per year for the
current tax system.<p>

		That's an obvious cost.  Some of the costs are
less obvious.  They're indirect costs that result from
the type of inefficiencies promoted by the tax system
over time, because we don't get the productive
investment that we normally would have.<p>

		My estimate of what this costs is somewhere in
the vicinity of $5000 per worker for this year alone. 
So, you can see the costs are enormous.  And these are
just the beginning of the costs.  <p>

		There are also psychological costs to a tax
system that undermines moral feelings and moral values.<p>

		My wife and I have a couple of friends who are
fairly well off.  They have gotten a divorce strictly
for tax reasons.  They claim they save $60,000 a year
by not being married, and yet they still live together.<p>

		You don't have to be wealthy.  My son, my first
son to get married, got married a year ago and found
out, after doing some calculations, that just being
married, instead of living together, meant that the
modest incomes that he and his wife make were taxed at
an extra $700 in terms of income tax, simply because
they had decided to go ahead and get married.<p>

		Traditionally, I think we like to have a lot of
respect for our government.  When we see a tax system
doing what it's doing to us, a great deal of resentment
builds up.  And clearly this resentment is not healthy.<p>

		Actually, I think the resentment would run even
deeper if people really understood the full costs and
the full quirks in the current tax system and some of
the ridiculous things they do.<p>

		For example, in my work and research into the
effect of the tax system on financial markets, it's
very clear to me that there is a substantial premium
that is in most interest rates as a result of the
nature of the tax system.  <p>

		The tax deductibility of the interest, on one
hand, and the fact that the government taxes interest
payments, on the other, adds approximately one-third to
every taxable interest rate that we're looking at.  <p>

		So, one-third of the taxable rates that we're
looking at are strictly attributable to the current tax
system.<p>

		What does that mean for mortgages?  That means
that an 8 percent mortgage under a system that did not
artificially exempt interest expenses and tax interest
rates, the 8 percent mortgage should really be less
than <p>

5-1/2 percent.  And that's what would happen under
certain reforms of the tax system.<p>

		Another interesting thing is federal debt.  The
federal government pays approximately $210 billion a
year in interest on the debt.  One-third of that
interest results from the in the tax system, $70
billion.  <p>

		Now, there's an offset.  The government gets
money back and gets revenue back when people pay taxes
on their interest income.<p>

		But there's not a full offset for a lot of
people.  For example, foreigners, rich foreigners,
wealthy foreigners, foreign central banks, foreign
institutions, all get the full benefit of this tax
premium that results from our tax law.<p>

		I have calculated that that is a pure gift to
wealthy foreigners of more than <p>

$15 billion every year that most people simply don't
accept or don't understand that's involved in the
current complexity of our tax laws.<p>

		So, there is a lot of abuse for the current tax
system.  I think that just about everyone is aware of
that.  And the key question is:  How should we change
it?<p>

		It's a very critical question.  In my research,
I've found that tax policy is the single most important
factor affecting economic growth and affecting incomes. 
And the opportunity for tax reform doesn't come around
too often.<p>

		And so when we do get the opportunity, it's
absolutely critical to get it right.  And getting it
right means making sure we don't make mistakes and
undertake some type of reform that's at least as bad or
perhaps worse than the current system.<p>

		The first type of reform that I believe is
definitely worse than the current system would involve
a VAT, or a valued-added tax.  This type of tax is an
utter failure wherever it's imposed.  <p>

		It's extremely complex.  It's highly expensive. 
It penalized those who have saved in the past.  And
it's a hidden tax.  People don't realize exactly what
they're paying for their government.  <p>

		And when they don't realize how much they're
paying for their government, there's a tendency to
demand more government than they otherwise would get.<p>

		Another direction that we don't want to go
would be a national sales tax.  A national sales tax is
certainly simpler than the VAT, not as expensive, but
it has the disadvantage of hitting those who are least
able to pay the hardest.<p>

		And if we try and play with the sales tax to
avoid hurting low-income people, by exempting certain
items and trying to tax higher incomes at a higher
rate, we end up with all the complexities of the
current tax system.  So, that's certainly a nonstarter.<p>

		In addition, the sales tax has the same
disadvantages of the VAT, in the sense that it
penalizes anyone who has saved in the past, because
their income is worth less under the new, high cost for
all these items.<p>

		And secondly, the cost of government is hidden. 
It's not obvious to people.  If you hide the cost of
government, people are going to demand more government
than they otherwise would.<p>

		Third, we don't want to reform the tax system
and keep the current high marginal tax rates.  And my
reason for this third point relates directly to some of
the research I have done on the effects of taxes on
economic activity.<p>

		What I have found is that taxes are a very
powerful force affecting economic activity.  Most of my
work has been devoted to something that I call the
effective marginal tax rate paid by upper-income
individuals, individuals in the 70th to 95th
percentile.  The effective marginal rate is the rate
they actually pay to the government after all the
deductions and everything else.<p>

		Looking at this rate historically, I have found
that for every one percentage point change in this
effective marginal tax rate, productivity growth in the
economy changes by roughly 2/10ths of a percent in the
opposite direction.  <p>

		Now, this doesn't sound like a whole lot, but
you add productivity changes up, and they accumulate
over years, and before you know it, you're talking
about very significant increases in living standards as
a result of this particular tax policy.<p>

		So, my conclusion with this respect is that we
don't want to raise or even keep marginal tax rates the
same.  <p>

		As a matter of fact, this research incidentally
suggests that when you go back historically, whenever
effective marginal tax rates were changed, it was
usually associated -- almost always associated with a
tax increase.  And the same was true whenever effective
marginal tax rates were cut.<p>

		The one example we have of lowering effective
marginal tax rates during the 1986 Tax Act, but trying
to balance it by raising taxes in other areas and
cutting off deductions, suggests that we do not the
same impact on productivity rule.  <p>

		As a result, if you really want positive impact
on the economy, it can't simply be a tradeoff of
lowering marginal rates and raising rates somewhere
else.  <p>

		The maximum amount of tradeoff is going to come
from lowering the rates, not only at the margin but
also on average, trying to get them down as low as
possible.<p>

		What should we do?  <p>

		In concept, the technical features of an ideal
tax have already been worked out by Hall and Rabushka
in their book "The Flat Tax."  They've done a lot of
work, over a decade of serious thinking.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Bob, with all due respect,
they're going to testify.  <p>

		We're going to spend three days with Rabushka
and --<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  Okay.  And let me just say one
thing about the Hall and Rabushka plan and also the
other plan.  The plan is a great plan.  <p>

		As a small business person, who looks at this,
also, from a business perspective, I believe that they
made a mistake in terms of their treatment of the
payroll tax.  And that's extremely important,
especially in light of some of the test -- <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Can we do that in Q&amp;A?  I want
to get to the other --<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  Sure.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  -- testimony and get some
interface --<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  Sure.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  -- with the Commission.<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  Okay.  Can I just make one last
point --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Absolutely.<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  -- just very quickly, on
something that was brought up earlier, because the main
objective, as I see it, of this Commission is going to
have to be to sell the public, first, on the abuses in
the system and, second, on the benefits that can be had
from the ideal tax --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Right.<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  -- the flat tax.<p>

		In terms of doing that, you can be as eloquent
as you possibly can, the written report, my belief is
that unfortunately today too many people don't read,
and they just don't pay any attention to that. <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  What would you suggest?<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  What I would suggest is the
panels that you're listening to, the passion that you
saw in the earlier panels today -- <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Right.<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  -- you've already got some
videotapes of that.  <p>

		If that can be put together in a half-hour or
an hour show, showing real people, the problems they've
encountered, and letting people know what in the heck
the problems are, and then quickly some vignettes on
some of the ideal solutions, I think that that would go
a long way to --<p>

Thank you, Bob.<p>

<p>

		<b>MR. HENDERSHOTT:</b>  Thank you for inviting me and
giving me the chance to see the fair city of Omaha.<p>

		It is a pleasure, again, to be of potential
service to Mr. Kemp.  He may not remember, but I was
the chief outside consultant for Price Waterhouse when
they did their first actual review of FHA back in '89,
'90.  And at that time, you were able to take steps to
help save FHA.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Thank you.<p>

		<b>MR. HENDERSHOTT:</b>  I hope the Commission will be
able to take steps to help save the future of my
granddaughters and other grandchildren in America.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Good.<p>

		<b>MR. HENDERSHOTT:</b>  Today is a particularly
appropriate day to have me on to talk about housing,
because there's an Op-Ed piece that you may or may not
have seen in the Wall Street Journal this morning by
Bruce Bartlett, titled "Will the Flat Tax KO Housing?"<p>

		As always, Mr. Bartlett says many interesting
things, but I'm afraid he isn't always entirely
correct.  And that's really -- it turns out that's
really the topic of my conversation this morning.<p>

		All investments -- virtually all investments
pay two kinds of returns.  They pay sort of a periodic
cash flow.  Stocks pay dividends, interest. 
Investments in real estate will pay various kinds of
net rents, and most investments will pay capital gains.<p>

		Now, owner-occupied housing is just like these
other investments.  Owner-occupied housing has a cash
flow return.  This cash flow return is the rents that
the occupier pays himself as the owner.  The implicit
rents are on owner-occupied housing.  That's the cash
flow.  Of course, in housing, you generally get capital
gains.<p>

		The tax advantage for owner-occupied housing is
the very light taxation of these returns.  We don't tax
the implicit rents on housing; and we tax the capital
gains at a very low rate, due to deferrals and the
like.<p>

		I could stop at that point, and I could tell
you that's the tax advantage to owner-occupied housing. 
Note that I have not mentioned the mortgage interest
deduction.<p>

		Due to my hard work, clean living, and mainly
aging and having a frugal wife, I have accumulated
significant wealth, so I don't have a mortgage on my
house.  It makes -- there's no advantage for me to have
a mortgage on my house. 		You could imagine me
getting a mortgage, investing it in Ginnie Mae
securities, the same kind of investment, a mortgage.  I
earn interest on the mortgage investments.  I pay taxes
on it.  I write off the mortgage interest as a tax
deduction.  It's a wash.  A mortgage interest deduction
doesn't give me a tax advantage.  The tax advantage is
the virtual nontaxation of the return from the asset.<p>

		Now, what role does the mortgage interest play? 
The mortgage interest deduction says that not only do I
get the tax advantage from owner-occupied housing, but
my children do.  My children are young.  They don't
have wealth.  They have to borrow.<p>

		What the mortgage interest deduction says is
that there will not be a penalty to debt financing of
housing.  The mortgage interest deduction does not give
a tax advantage to debt.  I have already shown that it
doesn't give me any advantage.  <p>

		The tax advantage, what the mortgage interest
deduction does is it says that young people will have
the tax advantage just as well as older people.  It
levels the playing field; it doesn't make in unlevel.<p>

		So, what would you do if you took away the
mortgage interest deduction?  When you take away the
mortgage interest deduction, you create an unlevel
playing field, you buy deficit financing of housing in
favor of equity, and you basically are going to cause a
redistribution of income.<p>

		Now, this isn't a redistribution between income
classes.  We know that the vast majority of the
advantage of the mortgage interest deduction goes to
higher-income people, but they pay most of the taxes. 
So, that's not going to cause any -- the redistribution
is from young to old.  <p>

		We take away the mortgage interest deduction,
we can use the revenue to lower taxes.<p>

		People like myself will get a tax break. 
People like my kids will get a tax break, but they'll
more than pay for it by not being able to deduct the
mortgage interest.  <p>

		So, to remove the mortgage interest deduction
would create a redistribution from young to old people,
and you, as the Commissioners, I am certain, know.<p>

		Now, one of our major problems is we've been
doing these kind of redistributions for the last two
decades, intentionally by raising real Social Security
benefits, unintentionally raising them through mixups
in the CPI in '82 and other things.  <p>

		We have been transferring resources from young
to the old.  We don't need to do any more of that.<p>

		I've got some more things on my sheet, but I
know we don't have any time, so I'll stop.  		
Thank you very much. 	<p>

<center>	"Comparison of Alternative Plans<p>

and Some Options"</center>
<p>

		<b>MR. ZODROW:</b>:  Thank you very much for inviting
me.  It's my pleasure to be here.<p>

		In my comments, what I'd like to do is discuss
briefly some general principles that economists use in
thinking about tax reform and how some of the various
consumption tax proposals that are out there stack up
against the current income tax in terms of those
criteria; and then also comment briefly on some general
outlines about the three plans that are out there. 
There are some things that you might think about in
reviewing these various proposals.<p>

		Let me begin by noting that there is fairly
widespread, although certainly not unanimous by any
means, agreement among academic economists and, I
think, business economists as well that consumption
taxes meet, generally speaking, the goals of a tax
system more -- they meet it better than an income tax
would, especially our current income tax.<p>

		The first of these goals really is the focus of
this Commission.  And that's the positive effects on
savings, capital formation, economic growth that a
consumption tax system might give rise to, as well as
the associated increases in economic efficiency that
would come from uniform taxation of both investment and
savings.  <p>

		It seems likely that a consumption<p>

based reform would result in some additional savings
and some additional growth, but I should warn you --
and I am sure this will come out in the hearings --
that there is a fair amount of disagreement as to
exactly how large this effect would be.  <p>

		So, I think it's important to think about the
other advantages of consumption taxation as well.<p>

		The second goal is fairness.  The basic
argument here, I think, is just that double taxation of
savings is unfair.  This has been refined in various
ways, but that's the nuts and bolts of it.<p>

		But there are a couple of other dimensions that
I think you have to worry about.  		One is the
obvious one, making the changes big, is that moving to
a consumption tax is going to be complicated if it is
accompanied by a redistribution of the tax burden from
the middle-class, upper-income people. <p>

		And so whether or not you think that's fair I
think is an open issue.  But I think it does complicate
the mix if you have estimates of redistribution
occurring.<p>

		The second is a transitional issue, which is
that any consumption-based tax is going to pretty
favorable to capital owners.  And so it's important, in
thinking about the design, to try to make that
favoritism apply only to new capital and new savings to
the extent possible, and thus try to avoid granting
windfall gains to existing capital owners.<p>

		The third goal of tax reform, I think, would be
just simplicity.  And in my view, this is the most
compelling argument for a consumption tax.  <p>

		Here I really don't refer to the flatness of
the tax, but rather just the calculation of the base,
both at the business level and at the individual level. 
<p>

		There are just a lot of ways in which a
consumption base is inherently simpler than an income
tax base.  The most obvious ones are because it
eliminates issues of timing, it eliminates issues of
inflation accounting.  At the individual level, taxes
are much simpler.<p>

		There are a lot of other ways that one argue
this point, but I think it's an important one to keep
in mind.<p>

		Next, comparison of the three approaches that
are most commonly discussed.  The most obvious would be
a national retail sales tax, the type that's being
advocated by Senator Lugar and Congressman Archer.<p>

		Until recently, I would say that this was not
viewed seriously as a replacement for an income tax,
but it seems to be getting some additional attention. 
The problems primarily are it's very difficult, as Bob
mentioned, to try to get any element of progressivity
into the system.  <p>

		And it's difficult to exempt the purchases of
the poor.  If you start doing so, you basically start
messing up the system.  You start losing the simplicity
that you're striving for.<p>

		Another big difficulty is that a national
retail sales tax, if combined with a state and local
sales tax, is going to give you rates around 30
percent.  <p>

		Presumably you've got everything focused on
that one transaction.  That gives you a lot of
incentives for avoidance.  <p>

		And I think what might happen is that the
monitoring and enforcement efforts that would be
involved could be just as bad as they are and just as
intrusive as they are under the current income tax. <p>

		Finally, the practice now, in terms of the
sales tax, is not too encouraging in that most
estimates suggest that businesses end up paying as much
as 50 percent of the so-called retail sales tax.  If
you do that, you're really losing almost all the
economic advantages of taxation on the basis of
consumption.<p>

		The second approach is typified by the Nunn-Domenici plan, but more generally is just referred to
as a cash flow tax.  There's sort of obviously a tax on
consumption in the sense that you get a deduction for
saving when your withdrawals are taxed, both the
principal and interest if they're consumed.  <p>

		It's a very elegant approach to consumption
taxes.  It has the advantages of being consistent with
some well-known features of the current law, IRAs,
401(k) plans, and such.  And it also appears to be
taxing capital income, although, in fact, not much of
that really happens.<p>

		But the main problem I think with Nunn-Domenici
is it just so complicated, and there are a variety of
schemes that could be used to avoid taxes or at least
defer them for long periods of time.<p>

		The other aspect of it is if you look at the
combined business and individual-level taxes, the top
rate approaches -- the combined rate is like 50
percent.  And I think, in terms of incentives, that's
something one would want to worry about considerably.<p>

		The last approach would be what's referred to
in the economic literature as a tax prepayment
approach, which is more commonly called the Armey or
the Hall-Rabushka flat tax.<p>

		I think it's the simplest approach.  It's
called a consumption tax because the tax burden is
similar, in present value terms, to what would arise
under an obvious consumption tax, even though it looks
more like a tax base they put on wage income and on
pension distributions. <p>

		Since it is an individually based tax, though,
it's easy to make it as progressive as you want.  And
it's easy to exclude low-income individuals from
paying, if that's what you wish to do, as well.<p>

		There is a very interesting problem with this
approach though, and that is that most economic
analyses of a Hall-Rabushka or an <p>

Armey-type plan suggest that the individual cash flow
alternative would lead to much bigger increases in
savings and much bigger increases in economic welfare.<p>

		This happens for two reasons.<p>

		First, under a cash flow tax, you've got to
save more, because you've got to anticipate paying
those future taxes.  <p>

		Now, that can be offset under an Armey plan,
but in order for that to happen, the government has to
save more.  But it just has to use the revenues it gets
earlier and use those to reduce deficits.  Some people
are understandably skeptical that that would happen.<p>

		The second issue is something which Bob alluded
to, and that is under a cash flow approach, effectively
what happens is you have a one-time hit on the owners
of existing assets, typically viewed to be the older
elements of the population.  <p>

		What that means is that you can use those
revenues to reduce future tax rates.  And also, because
you're redistributing from the old -- you know,
speaking in general terms, from the old, who tend to be
consuming, to the young, who are in the savings
portions of their life cycle, you have another impetus
to saving.<p>

		So, both of these tend to give you pretty big
effects under a cash flow approach, which you don't get
under Hall-Rabushka.<p>

		What the latter suggests, I suppose, is that
you want to worry a bit about under the Hall-Rabushka
or Armey plan, about trying to avoid giving a windfall
gain to the elderly or to owners of existing capital
assets, because basically what you do is you'd say,
well, let's forgive expected future taxes on capital
income.  So, you're redistributing income in the other
direction.<p>

		One final point on that issue is just to -- I'm
sure this will come up in the hearings -- is some
people are actually advocating a cash flow approach,
but for this reason.  <p>

		In other words, they're saying, "Well, it's a
good thing to impose a windfall tax on the elderly,
because it reverses some of the effects of the other
fiscal policies that Pat mentioned that have
redistributed income from the younger generations to
older generations.<p>

		I see I'm running out of time.  I'll make one
final point -- <p>

<p>

		<b>MR. ANDERSON:</b>  Thank you.    <p>

		Welcome to Nebraska.<p>

		I'd like to comment briefly on the effects and
potential implIcations for state and local governments
--<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Good.<p>

		<b>MR. ANDERSON:</b> -- from a federal tax reform.  <p>

		With some experience in the state and local
arena, I'd like to think through some issue with you
about what might happen if there is a federal reform
and how states are likely to respond.<p>

		Secondly, I'll address the issue of the
potential effects on state and local governments
bending and, finally, say some things about the effects
on the portfolio of taxes that state and local
governments have and how it might be altered with
federal reform.<p>

		First of all, what's the likely effect on state
governments, in terms of how they finance local public
goods and services?<p>

		Well, I think it's pretty clear that states
will generally conform to the federal base changes that
occur.  And I think we can draw on some experience from
the Tax Reform Act of 1986, to see that that's going to
happen.<p>

		States generally moved in the direction of
adapting their income taxes, those that have an income
tax, to the federal base definition.  They vary in
deductions, exemptions, credits, and rate structure, of
course.  But, by and large, states conformed to the
federal definition of "adjusted gross income."		<p>

		If we move in the direction of some kind of
consumption-based tax at the federal level, the
incentive will be there for states to conform to the
base definition, if not the credits and deductions and
exemptions and so on.  At least for the purposes of
defining the base, they're likely to begin with the
federal definition of the base.<p>

		That means that states would have the ability
to define differently the progressivity or regressivity
of their state tax based on how they set deductions,
exemptions, and what kind of credit mechanisms they
might attach to that base.  <p>

		They might have to worry about location effects
and other factors as a result, but it doesn't lock the
states into identical tax systems necessarily.<p>

		Secondly, there are some issues of
deductibility that have to be thought through.<p>

		The current situation on the income tax, where
we've got income and property taxes deductible on the
federal income tax, but sales taxes are not deductible,
is clearly an uneasy compromise between two competing
views of what should happen with deductibility.  <p>

		And a major reform ought to think that through
a little bit more carefully and decide which way to go,
either allow deductibility of all state and local taxes
or disallow them.  <p>

		Perhaps, if you're interested, we can talk
about the relative arguments on both sides of that. 
But the current situation is an uneasy one, where we're
trying to mix two views on deductibility with our
current nondeductibility of sales taxes.<p>

		And secondly, let me say, related to the
deductibility, that a tax reform that lowers marginal
tax rates, of course, reduces the impact of
deductibility in any case.  It doesn't take away the
problem, but it reduces the impact that deductibility
has. <p>

		Deductibility really reduces the differences in
tax prices that are paid across locations for state and
local public goods and services.  <p>

		And a tax reform that eliminates or reduces
deductibility will have the impact of exaggerating
price differences across communities, and that has
clear implications that you may want to think through.<p>

		Finally, related to the federal tax reform and
likely responses from states is the question of
windfall revenues if there is base broadening in any
sense.  We worried about that with the Tax Reform Act
of '86.  We saw what happened.  <p>

		And by and large, there was significant
political pressure to avoid collecting windfalls.  So,
I would presume there would be a similar outcome in
this case.  <p>

		If there's significant base-broadening, the
states are likely to be sensitive to that and avoid
collecting large windfalls.<p>

		What are the effects on state and local
government spending?  Well, here I think the context is
important to think about.  <p>

		Reform of the tax system is being considered
here amid very dramatic changes that are taking place
with respect to federal grant programs as well.  And
the design of the grant mechanisms can greatly affect
state and local spending behavior.  <p>

		Block grants that come have only income
effects.  Matching grants, of course, have both price
effects, substitution effects, as well as income
effects.<p>

		And so what needs to be done is to think
through carefully the combination of a tax reform and a
restructuring of the federal grant system and sending
money back to state and local governments.<p>

		Lower marginal tax rates at the federal level,
together with the potential loss of deductibility,
might raise the tax price for state and local public
goods and result in reduced demand for those goods. 
But the outcome depends crucially on what happens with
redesigning federal grant systems as well. <p>

		Let me conclude by saying there may be effects
on the tax portfolio of state and local governments. 
The long-term trend has been away from property taxes
at the state and local level, especially at the local
level, and toward income and sales taxes.<p>

		Federal tax reform can have direct effects on
the portfolio of revenue sources that state and local
governments rely on.  It may further encourage that
long-term trend, or it may encourage a different
direction.  <p>

		Federal tax reform can also have indirect
effects on tax arbitrage mechanisms on the portfolios
of state and local governments and have an impact that
way as well. <p>

		Well, let me stop there and --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Thank you.<p>

		<b>MR. ANDERSON:</b>  -- see what questions you may
have.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Thank you.  That's a good place
to turn to Matt Fong, Treasurer of the State of
California.<p>

		Mr. Fong. <p>

		COMMISSIONER FONG:  I'd like to follow up on
some of the state and local issues. California and
other states as well rely principally on a lot
municipal financing to do their infrastructure.<p>

		What impact do you think there would be if we
eliminated the difference between the taxable and the
nontaxable as we are trying to do infrastructure? <p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Well, to the extent that we
reduce marginal tax rates, we would expect the
differential between the taxable and the nontaxable
issues to shrink. <p>

		The question is whether that shrinking by
itself has important implications.<p>

		A tax reform that also has the impact of
stimulating savings might be expected to lower interest
rates in general.  <p>

		And so we're talking about thinking about two
different effects here:  	<p>

		How would tax reform affect the overall level
of interest rates?  <p>

		And how would it affect the differential
between taxable issues and nontaxable issues?<p>

		And the combination of the two things going on
at the same time is quite complex.  But there's no
question if you're moving in the direction of lower
marginal rates, you'd expect the differential to
shrink.  <p>

		That means, for a municipality, that the price
of activity relative to what it would take to go out
and borrow at taxable rates goes up.  So, it becomes
more expensive for municipalities to fund their
projects. <p>

		On the other hand, there may be an impact on
interest rates overall that works in the opposite
direction.  <p>

		And some of the other panelists could certainly
comment on that as well.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Ted.<p>

		MR. FORSTMANN:  Yes.  I wanted to ask a couple
of questions of Professor Hendershott if I could.<p>

		I listened pretty carefully to it,  because I
think this something that's going to come up.  And I
got a little lost, because -- and I have three things
to say here.  <p>

		You were saying that if this deduction were
done away with that equity would be favored or promoted
over debt.  <p>

		But my first question would be -- and maybe
I'll ask them -- all three at the same time.<p>

		My first question would be:  Well, without
arguing that point, isn't debt favored over equity now? 
<p>

		If you're going to get a tax benefit from doing
something in a particular way, you're using debt and
you don't get one from equity, isn't debt favored over
equity now?  And what's good about that?  Number one.<p>

		Number two.  If interest rates are going to
decline by a third, why can't your -- you know, why
can't the young person -- he doesn't get the deduction,
but he pays less for his loan, so why -- what's the
difference?  I don't see the difference.<p>

		So -- and if I'm right, then you must disagree
with Mr. Genetski, that the interest rate is going to
decline.<p>

		And lastly, even if you can answer the first
two questions, when you hear these kinds of horror
stories that you heard today from people -- and we've
been hearing and hearing and hearing, and we'll hear
more of -- and you realize that we've got, you know, a
huge problem to deal with here.<p>

		So even if the first two questions can't be
answered and we are going to favor the elderly over the
young, and we're going to favor equity over debt, and
we're going to do all that stuff relative to what we're
trying to accomplish, if you take the position that if
you allow one -- if you go to some flatter thing and
you allow one deduction to get in, and you know that if
you allow one to get in, the next thing, number two, is
going to show up, and then number three is going to
show up, and you're going to be back where you started,
is it all that important, relative to what we're trying
to accomplish here?<p>

		<b>MR. HENDERSHOTT:</b>  Well, I think there are a lot
of ifs here.  I want to -- but there is one factual or
conceptual issue that you raised, and that is:  Is debt
currently favored relative to equity?<p>

		Now, if you look at the taxation of
corporations, debt is favored relative to equity.  They
get to deduct their interest payments, but they don't
deduct their dividend payments.  And they're paying
taxes on income.<p>

		The difference with owner-occupied housing is
there is no tax on income.  There's no tax on income. 
And for people who equity finance, there's no write-off.  But why write off as long as there isn't a tax? <p>

		But when you talk about debt -- I mean,
basically people like myself are able to invest in
owner-occupied housing and earn a pretax return, a
nontaxable return, and we fund at a pretax cost.  It's
the opportunity cost, the cost of funds.<p>

		But if I invest with debt financing, I earn a
pretax rate of return, but I have to pay this under
current law -- under current law, I get to deduct the
interest, so I finance it with an after-tax yield.  And
the same thing is true if I finance it with equity.<p>

		My opportunity cost to investing my equity in
the house is to invest it in bonds or something where I
would be taxed.  <p>

		So, the opportunity cost of equity financing is
an after-tax yield.  The opportunity cost of debt
financing is an <p>

after-tax cost.  Those are equal.  That's a fair
system, a neutral system.  Take away the mortgage
interest deduction, it won't be neutral anymore.<p>

		Now, we might have to do this again sometime.<p>

		Your other points -- you know, I truly believe
that if we went to a -- if we lower tax rates a lot --
of course, if we lower tax rates a lot, the value of
the mortgage interest deduction goes down also.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Right.<p>

		<b>MR. HENDERSHOTT:</b>  I truly believe if we lower
tax rates, that interest rates will go down.  I don't
believe they're going to go down as much as some other
people might argue.<p>

		There is an alternative view, and that is that
we have world capital markets.  And, in effect, then
the world sets our interest rates.  So, what the hell,
it doesn't make any difference.<p>

		I don't accept that view, but I don't accept
the -- I mean, I've done research myself that suggests
that tax rates do get built into interest rates.  But I
don't think -- they aren't going to fall that much. 
But they will fall.<p>

		Regarding these horror stories -- all right,
the last thing -- you know, we're obviously -- or
you're starting to argue about third best, fourth best. 
<p>

		You know, we can't do things exactly right,
but, no, it certainly is true that there is a -- that
taking away the home mortgage interest deduction,
combined with some other things, might be a good idea. 
I won't deny that.  <p>

		My basic point is that, on its face, taking
away the mortgage interest deduction doesn't make
sense.  <p>

		And if you don't like the tax advantage that
owner-occupied housing has, you should try and get rid
of it some other way.  <p>

		One other way is, of course, lower tax rates,
which means the relative advantage to owner-occupied
housing goes down.  You can take away the property tax
deduction, which I think is a fine idea.  <p>

		You could generally tax other investments less,
like the '81 Tax Act did.  I mean, you can do a lot of
things to take it away.  I don't think the mortgage
interest deduction is the right, but that's --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  I don't think you and Mr.
Forstmann are all that far off, because you keep
mentioning the marginal tax rate, and the value of the
exemption or deduction or credit goes down relative to
the reduction of the marginal rate.<p>

		What Mr. Forstmann is getting at, if I can be
so bold, is that if we are to get the rates as low as
we possibly can, and reduce the amount of not only
social engineering in the Code but also remove the tax
consequence of investment and saving and income-producing decisions, then I think he is on to
something; that once, if you get the rates as low as
you can, you've got to be careful that you don't start
adding back the problems that will complicate and
frustrate and exacerbate and add all the barriers to
productive economic activity.  <p>

		So, again, we're not prejudging the outcome,
but I think every man and woman on this panel wants to
find a way, within reason, in a political world, to get
the rates on productive human economic activity, i.e.,
working, saving, investing, and engaging in
entrepreneurial <p>

risk-taking -- want to get the rates as low as
possible, get the barriers removed, and let this
country explode into the 21st century.<p>

		John Wieland might have a sympathetic question.<p>

		MR. WIELAND:  Might I just add something?  If
you want to take away the mortgage interest deduction
for second and third homes, you know, that's fine.  But
I think the mortgage interest deduction in our current
Tax Code is a neutrality, rather than a glare.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Well, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
The current Tax Code stinks.  We are here to reform it
and change it and write a new one.  So --<p>

		MR. WIELAND:  I know.  I'm saying this aspect
of the current Tax Code is an appropriate aspect, given
the rest of the Code.  <p>

		And if you stick with the current Code, even if
you can --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  In the current Code --<p>

		MR. WIELAND:  -- lower tax rates to the point --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  In the current Code, the
interest deduction on a mortgage is sacrosanct --
sacrosanct.  It is sacred.<p>

		MR. WIELAND:  Well --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  I'm the Housing Secretary.  <p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		But we're not here --<p>

		MR. WIELAND:  You were the Housing --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  -- to defend the status quo.  <p>

		Reagan used to say, "'Status quo" is a Latin
phrase for the mess we're in."'  <p>

		And we're in a mess.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		We're going to get out of it.<p>

		So, Mr. Wieland.<p>

		MR. WIELAND:  Dr. Hendershott, I like your
analysis.  <p>

		I have two questions at this point.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Disputatious Commissioner.<p>

		MR. WIELAND:  The first is I would assume that
young people don't need really big houses.  So, if
we're going to, you know, eliminate this transfer from
the young to the old, you know, you said second homes
wouldn't need to be protected.  What caps would you
set, or would you set caps?	<p>

		<b>MR. HENDERSHOTT:</b>  I'm not sure that I would set
any caps at all.  <p>

		I think we -- I mean, young -- I mean, you
mentioned that young households don't need big houses. 
Well, nobody needs a big house.  		We're talking
about people being able to consume the resources they
have.  There may be some very-high-income young people
who should be having big houses, and they're going to
have to fund it with a lot of debt.  <p>

		When you start putting caps on, you're really -- you're trying to change the distribution of taxes in
the U.S. is what you're basically trying to do.  <p>

		And if you think that young people -- or,
excuse me, if you think that high-income people don't
pay enough taxes, you ought to tax them more heavily. 
I'm not sure the way to do it is to cap their interest
deduction.  So, I would not put caps on.<p>

		MR. WIELAND:  Second question.  First of all,
I'd like to say that you were described to me as the
best housing economist in the United States.  So, I
value your insights --<p>

		<b>MR. HENDERSHOTT:</b>  Well, I'd like to know who
the -- who made that statement.  I would send them a
Christmas card.<p>

		MR. WIELAND:  If people were convinced that the
mortgage interest deduction should go, what thoughts
would you have as to the transition aspects of people
who presently have mortgages?<p>

		<b>MR. HENDERSHOTT:</b>  That is a tough question that
I haven't thought a lot about.  There ought to be some
transitional thing.  I would certainly worry about
that. <p>

		On the other hand, if interest rates are going
to fall, you need less transition.  And also, there are
a number of people who probably, if you took away their
mortgage interest deduction, would find ways to have a
smaller mortgage.  <p>

		They currently have marketable assets they
could use to pay off their other mortgages, but there
just isn't an incentive under today's Tax Code.  <p>

		I can't -- I'll be glad to think about that,
but I don't want to answer it.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  We asked some of the people in
the audience if they would like to ask a question.  <p>

		And so any one of you --<p>

		Let me just make a couple of questions on their
behalf, and then treat it any way you possibly can.<p>

		First of all, from Rosalie Shepherd (phonetic),
not a question but a comment.  She is the director of
United We Stand America -- here in Nebraska I assume.  <p>

		And she wants us all to come to the national
conference in Dallas from August 11th to the 13th,
where this will be a main topic of the United We Stand
America people.  <p>

		They've got Bob Dole, Newt Gingrich, Phil
Gramm, Dick Gephardt, and other top <p>

policy-makers and a lot of grassroots folks.<p>

		So that's a plug for -- Rosalie, you left off
your 1-800 number.  Ross would be very upset that you
left off the 1-800 number. <p>

		I think it's Don or Dan Bartley (phonetic). <p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Don.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Don.  <p>

		And this -- you addressed it a little bit, Bob
Genetski.<p>

		How do we remove the social engineering aspects
of the tax system?  How do we get the cleanest system
to raise revenue for government's legitimate functions
and not get into the social engineering that now is
implicit -- in some cases explicit -- in the Tax Code? <p>

		And as you're thinking about that, one of the
ways in '81 we tried to remove the poor from the Tax
Code and deal with the payroll tax, alluded to so
eloquently in our earlier panel, was the earned income
tax credit.<p>

		Take those two questions, social engineering
and removing the poor from the burden of the payroll
tax by increasing the earned income tax credit.  And,
of course, this is phased out.  It leads to a high
marginal rate at a certain point, so those are two
questions that can be addressed by the panel.<p>

		Thank you.<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  Yes.  And I think --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  That was just to get the name
of the -- Pat O'Malley (phonetic) from Tax Help asked
the question of how many values are destroyed by
phasing in and out of the earned income tax credit.<p>

		Go ahead, Bob.  Excuse me.<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  It seems to me that the Armey
bill deals with that in the simplest, most effective
way, by getting the tax down to a flat rate for
everyone; and then allowing for a significant
deduction, so that anyone making up to, say, $35,000
doesn't have to pay tax.  <p>

		And then the 17 percent starts to come in after
that, a family of four gets that.<p>

		That seems to be the most straightforward,
simplest way.  And everyone can understand what's
happening, and you do away with the social engineering
and the very high marginal tax rates associated with
people getting government benefits.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  George.<p>

		<b>MR. ZODROW:</b>:  Well, I'd just like to note that
as far as the earned income tax credit, is to relate it
to a comment that was made earlier.  The earned income
tax credit, I think, was instituted with all kinds of
good motives.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes.<p>

		<b>MR. ZODROW:</b>:  But one of the side effects has
been that it dramatically increases the marriage
penalties on low-income households.<p>

		Some of the marriage penalties -- you have to
set the example up right, but if you do, and then you
have the right people getting married, the marriage
penalties are just horrendous, especially relative to
the tax burdens that the family would pay.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  I'm glad that the motives were
not challenged, because I was one of the co-authors of
the earned income tax credit because I realized there
were so many low-income people moving into their first
job at Herman Cain's pizza factory --<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		-- or anyplace else faced a marginal tax rate
of unbelievable -- the highest rate of taxation in the
country was a low-income woman trying to take a job
with a child or two or a father who's unemployed who
takes his first job.<p>

		So, is the answer, Bob, to social engineering,
just get simplicity of a flatter, fairer, simpler,
lower rate system and then exempt the poor by using the
personnel exemption?<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  That would be my answer.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes.  Up to -- did you have a
question?<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Well, follow-up to that.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Go, go.  You're on.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  You started to mention earlier,
but you didn't get a chance, since you had mentioned
the flat tax, and you said that was a criticism that
you had of Hall-Rabushka.  <p>

		Could you comment on that --<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  Yes, yes.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  -- since we are talking about
that?<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  Yes, the -- in <p>

Hall-Rabushka, they try to avoid dealing with the
payroll taxes, because that's a whole different ball
game from the income tax.  And you really chew up an
awful lot just in dealing with the income tax alone.<p>

		But they are forced to deal with it, because it
is such a big factor, and at least recommend how they
would incorporate dealing with the payroll tax into
their flat tax system.  And they've got two possible
ways of solving the problem. <p>

		One is to treat Social Security -- or the
payroll portion -- as a pension, allow business to
deduct the tax that business has to pay and then tax
the people who receive Social Security benefits.  <p>

		They chose not to do that.  They chose to treat
the payroll tax as if it were a fringe benefit, and
therefore not to allow business to deduct the payroll
tax, but then have people who receive the Social
Security benefits receive them tax-free.  <p>

		This, to me, is the wrong decisions for a
couple of reasons.<p>

		First, I believe it puts a tremendous
additional benefit or cost on businesses, when you
clearly have to pay this item out.  It's not like a
fringe benefit, where you can raise wages in return for
that.<p>

		Also -- and this is a very important point for
those who eventually believe and would like to see
Social Security changed along the lines it has been
done in Chile -- the more you treat the Social Security
system as a pension, it appears to me the easier it's
going to be to make that transition.  <p>

		The more you treat it as some sort of a fringe
benefit, I think the more difficult it's going to be to
achieve that.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Thank you.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Commissioner Kleckner.<p>

		COMMISSIONER KLECKNER:  For any of you, but
maybe Bob Geneski and George Zodrow, you commented
earlier -- well, all of you did -- on the -- maybe the
ease of taxation or the -- in my words, "a hidden tax
versus a hurting tax." <p>

		You know, tax withholding for income tax
reasons, you're either on salary, your tax is withheld,
all the employees' tax is withheld.  		Our
employees at American Farm Bureau, 100 or so that we
have, really don't know how much money -- they know
what they get in their check, but they don't know the
total that they get, compared to a small businessman or
a farmer that has to write that check once a year or
twice a year, or whatever.  So, we know it's hurting.  <p>

		Your views on hidden taxes versus hurting
taxes, which are more transparent.  And also the idea
of tax withholding.  <p>

		If Shirley Peterson were here -- and I know she
regretted she had to leave -- but the IRS perspective
is you've got to withhold or people can't pay or won't
pay.<p>

		I tend to agree with Shirley, but on this one,
heck, farmers pay all the time or we go to jail.  And
we pay by the 1st of March, not April 15th, mainly.<p>

		I wanted, when I became American Farm Bureau
president, to pay our employees just one check a year -- wanted to start out once every quarter, went to once
every six months, and once a year, give them their
whole check, and maybe even withhold some so that they
wouldn't have to get anything back.  <p>

		I proposed doing it in December, give them a
little extra check at Christmastime, or a bigger check,
whole check, and "This is what you're really earning
before all the withholding."  <p>

		I was told we couldn't do it.  It's illegal.  I
guess we'd have gone to jail if we had tried to do it.  <p>

		But the idea -- are we to the point where we
got to withhold or the whole tax structure of the
country collapses, IRS goes into orbit if we don't
withhold, because we'll all go to jail or not?  What do
you think?<p>

		Anybody?  <p>

		George.<p>

		<b>MR. ZODROW:</b>:  Well, I think the main advantage
of withholding is just a present value issue.  If
everybody were to wait until the end of the year, then
it just would be a matter of higher rates that would
have to be assessed in order to get the same present
value of revenues to the government.<p>

		In terms of the visibility of the taxes or the
extent to which the role that the tax structure plays
in terms of the overall level of government
expenditures, I don't think there's actually that much
difference between the various approaches.  <p>

		It's more a situation where, I think, that if
you were to, say, load up with the sales tax.  People
say the sales tax is hidden and for that reason it
would tend to lead to bigger government.  <p>

		If you had a sales tax, a national sales tax of
21, 22 percent; and you had state sales taxes, 5, 6, 8
percent; local taxes, maybe 1 or 2 percent on top of
that, people would notice that.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		That's not a tax which would be a hidden tax.<p>

		The same thing applies, I think, to income
taxes.  People sometime say that withholding is a means
of a hidden tax.  And I suppose there's some validity
to that.  But everyone has to fill out their tax
return, and everyone sees that bottom line.  And it's
hard to imagine, really, that that is that much of a
hidden tax.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  That's the question that
Richard <b>MR. SCHENKEN:</b> (phonetic), who's in our audience, asked
about, the visibility of the tax.<p>

		Bob, do you want to take a shot at this whole
question of transparency and visibility and --<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  Well, just as a <p>

general --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  -- can we keep the government
from demanding more and more and more?<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  I would say, just as a general
principle of good taxation, that the tax system,
whatever it is, should be a transparent as possible.  <p>

		Now, the problem is, is it going to end up
being more work, more time, more effort to have the
employee write out the check, send it to the
government?  Is that more paperwork?  And does it
really pay in the end?  Or to just have the employer
take it out? <p>

		One way or another, you're balancing
transparency with the costs, the additional costs
involved.  And I'm not sure the additional costs are
worthwhile.  But whatever tax system you come up with,
I think it should be as transparent as possible so that
people very obviously know what they're paying.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Pat, do you want to make a
comment on that?<p>

		<b>MR. HENDERSHOTT:</b>  Yes.  I think  withholding is
obviously here to stay.  But the thing I really object
to in the Tax Code, probably more than anything, is
this hidden marginal tax rate, where you're phasing out
the personal exemptions, the standard deduction.  What
a crock.  <p>

		I mean, to be able to argue that our marginal
tax rates are low and this is going on -- I mean, this
is just really -- <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  We can put you down as a strong
view on that subject.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		<b>MR. ZODROW:</b>:  I don't feel strongly about that
though.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes, right.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		Well, that aroma that is weaving its way
through this room is that of the finest pizza --<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		-- in the Midwest.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  In the world.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  The Western Judeo-Christian
civilization.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		Klaus Beck (phonetic), our last question, asked
something that I think is critical to our
deliberations.<p>

		Hypothetically now, once we get a new system --
again, big hypothesis -- I believe it can be done, and
I believe the '96 election will be fought out over
these issues.  Okay?  That's what we believe.  <p>

		That's why we're doing this work.  There isn't
anybody here who is getting anything personal out of
this.  We're not seeking anything.  We're not being
paid.  <p>

		But how do you lock it in?  How do we lock in
the principle that the government should raise
legitimate revenues efficiently, effectively, with the
least burden on the poor and those least able to bear
that burden, but not consume our income?  <p>

		How do we -- do we have a constitutional
amendment?  Do we have a national referendum?<p>

		What would be your advice -- real quick -- on
how to lock in -- as much as humanly, politically
possible -- a 21st century Tax Code for American?  <p>

		Any comments?<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  I'd say a super-majority to raise
taxes --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  In the Congress?	<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  In Congress or to -- and by
raising taxes, I mean increasing tax <p>

breaks --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  -- and all this kind of thing.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Dick Gephardt came out for a
national referendum.  I thought that was interesting. <p>

		John?  Or George?  Or Bob?<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Well, let me just make one quick
comment, which is that the national referendum or the
super majority, or whatever it might be, I think really
should apply to issues of base.  <p>

		I think most people think in terms of rates,
and let's hold a cap on rates.  But rates presumably
are going to fluctuate, depending on international and
national conditions, and even taste regarding public
services.     <p>

		I think the critical feature here, though, is
the change in the base.  If you're successful in
getting a truly pure base, if you will, then that is
the item which I think you need to focus on in terms of
designing your super-majorities.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Bob.<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  Yes.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Any comment?  We're going to --<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  No, I'm not a big fan of
constitutional amendments.  I think we might have too
many.  I'd like to take the -- what is it, the
allowance of the income tax, 16th Amendment?  I'd like
to take that out.  But other than that, Congress has so
many ways of circumventing whatever amendment that you
put.<p>

		Just -- again, putting the burdens of whatever
it wants to do directly on business, instead of running
it through the tax system, has been their latest ploy.  <p>

		It's really a question of good will more than
anything else.  <p>

		And the one thing that happens, if you go to
the flat tax system, is you switch a heck of a lot of
power and influence away from Congress.<p>

		PARTICIPANTS:  Away from politicians?<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  From politicians.  <p>

		And you're -- essentially -- and this is one of
the challenges -- you're asking those politicians to
give up something that they hold near and dear.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		And as a result of that, the arguments in favor
of a flat tax have to be overwhelming to overcome that
huge objection.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  I mentioned in the last hearing
-- in Boston, I think -- that a city councilman in Hong
Kong -- I made no secret of the fact that I had been an
admirer of the <p>

Hong Kong economic miracle.  The last city councilman
who advocated doing away with the <p>

15 percent flat income tax in Hong Kong lost his seat,
overwhelmingly.<p>

		Thanks for you being here, Bob, and Pat.  Thank
you, George, John.  Appreciate a view from the groves
of academe.<p>

		I would invite my fellow Commissioners to step
over to the podium.  We're going to do a little press
availability to let some of our friends in the press
get back at us after those vicious attacks, ad hominem
--<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		-- on the press.<p>

		And then we'll, at 12:30 sharp, have a pizza
lunch.<p>

		Thank you all for being here.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Thank you.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  And we appreciate the good
questions from our audience.<p>

		Thank you.<p>

		(Applause)<p>

		(Whereupon, at approximately 12:20 p.m., the NATIONAL COMMISSION ON ECONOMIC GROWTH
AND TAX REFORM PUBLIC HEARING was adjourned.)<p>

<h3>TAX REFORM COMMISSIONERS TO APPEAR ON
C-SPAN VIEWER CALL-IN, MONDAY, OCTOBER 23
</CENTER>

<P>
 <blockquote>Taxpayers from across America will have an opportunity
to discuss tax reform with members of the National Commission
and Economic Growth and Tax Reform during a nationally televised
viewer call-in program next week.
<P>
 The program will air, live, from 9:00 a.m. until
10:00 a.m. EST, on Monday, October 23, 1995, on C-Span.  Brian
Lamb, the network's founder and CEO, will moderate the show.
<P>
 During the program, viewers can ask questions of
Tax Reform Commissioners Herman Cain, Chairman and CEO of Godfather's
Pizza, and Jack Faris, President of the National Federation of
Independent Business (NFIB).  Jack Kemp, Chairman of the Tax Reform
Commission, will lead-off the program with an unedited pre-recorded
interview.
<P>
 The 14-member Tax Reform Commission was appointed
by Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich
earlier this year, and charged with making recommendations for
a tax code that will encourage economic growth and greater opportunity
for all Americans.  
<P>
 The Commission recently completed a series of public
hearings across the country, 12 in all, where some 120 witnesses
testified.  Among those were citizens representing family farms,
inner city business, the high-tech community, academia, small
businesses, large manufacturers, government entities, and Wall
Street.
<P>
 The Tax Reform Commission expects to issue its final
recommendations in early 1996.

<h3>PUBLIC HEARING TO HIGHLIGHT IMPORTANCE OF TAX
REFORM TO URBAN AREAS</h3>
<blockquote>
<B>Chairman Jack Kemp and Tax Reform Commission members
to hear from inner city entrepreneurs, congressional and policy
experts</B>
</CENTER>

<P>

<B>WASHINGTON, D.C. -</B> Access
to capital, credit and job opportunities in our nation's urban
areas will be among the highlights a public hearing at Howard
University in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday that will feature entrepreneurs,
as well as congressional and policy experts, according to Jack
Kemp, chairman of the National Commission Economic Growth and
Tax Reform.
<P>
&quot;Citizens from several important sectors will
emphasize the importance of tax reform to economic growth, jobs
and ownership in our nation's urban areas,&quot; said Kemp, former
secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
<P>
Among those scheduled as witnesses for the hearing
are: Steve Mariotti, President and CEO, National Foundation for
Teaching Entrepreneurship; Frank Almeda, a participant in the
National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship; Michele Dyson,
President and CEO, CIS, Inc., a high-tech information company
she founded; U.S. Rep. Linda Smith (R-WA), Chair of the Tax and
Finance Subcommittee of the House Small Business Committee; and,
Barbara Franklin, Barbara Franklin Enterprises, former U.S. Commerce
Secretary.
<P>
The hearing is scheduled for Tuesday, September 26,
beginning at 9:00 a.m. at the Blackburn Center, West Ballroom,
Howard University, Georgia Avenue and Howard Place entrance, Washington,
D.C.  It is free and open to the public. 
<P>
By the end of September, the Tax Reform Commission
will have held 12 public meetings in the three months since it
was formed.  The commission is determined to &quot;listen first.&quot;
It is holding this series of public hearings to learn from the
American people their frustrations, fears, and concerns with the
federal income tax system.  More than 100 witnesses, from a cross-section
of American life, have already testified before the Tax Reform
Commission, during hearings in Washington, D.C.; Boston, Massachusetts;
Omaha, Nebraska; Charlotte, North Carolina; Palo Alto, California
(Silicon Valley); South-central Los Angeles; and Harlem in New
York City.
<P>
&quot;We are searching for real ideas, from real
people, for real reform,&quot; said Kemp.  &quot;We have already
found overwhelming dismay and frustration with the current system.
 The federal tax code, with its high marginal rates, and mindboggling
rules and regulations, is choking economic growth in all sectors
of American life.  It is burdensome to minority men and women
who want the seed corn and venture capital necessary to achieve
their part of the American dream.&quot;
<P>
Kemp said that as currently written, the tax code:
<UL>
<LI>Punishes the most dynamic forces for growth in
our economy -- the small business owners and entrepreneurs who
turn bold ideas into new businesses, new jobs, and new products.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Discourages working Americans who are trying
to save for the future and to build a better life for themselves
and their families.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Is endlessly complex and confusing, costing literally
billions of dollars in lost time and effort.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Senate Leader Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich
have charged the 14-member commission with making recommendations
for a tax code that is &quot;flatter, fairer, and simpler&quot;
-- a system that will encourage economic growth and greater opportunity
for all Americans.  
<P>
The commission hopes to present recommendations that
will make the tax code more family friendly and create incentives
for saving and investment. Its aim is to help guide the tax reform
debate toward changes that will reinvigorate entrepreneurship,
risk taking, saving, investment, and work effort. It hopes to
contribute to changes that will make America more competitive
and expand the nation's worldwide leadership in the 21st century
economy. 
<P>
Among the issues it is studying:  What are the implications
to the economy of a steeply progressive tax system? What is the
impact on economic growth of higher marginal tax rates? What do
people mean whey they say they want a &quot;fairer&quot; tax system?
 What do we mean by &quot;flatter&quot; tax rates?  &quot;There
are a lot of different views, and we want to know what the American
people think and what are the ramifications,&quot; Kemp said.
<P>
&quot;We are setting the stage for American tax policy
for the new century.  We hope that this series of hearings will
help all of us to learn more about the changes that are needed
to make better informed decisions about the hard choices that
lie ahead,&quot; Kemp said. &quot;If we can find the core, central
principles of a new vision for tax reform that includes everyone's
views, we can get this done. The American people -- and our children
and grandchildren-- will be the winners.&quot;
<P>
Besides Chairman Kemp, <a href="/taxcom/commlst.html">Commission members</a> include

<h3>Tax Reform Commission Holds Five Public Hearings in September</h3>
</CENTER>

<P>
 
<P>
<blockquote>
<B>WASHINGTON, D.C. -</B> The
National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, chaired
by Jack Kemp, will hold five public hearings during September
as the group continues to gather testimony from taxpayers and
tax experts around the country about the need for reform. 
<P>
The commission's next hearing will be<B> Friday,
September 8, </B>in Los Angeles at the Museum of Natural History
at 900 Exposition Boulevard in South Central LA. The hearing will
begin at 9 a.m.  It is free, and the public is invited.  Local
citizens will present their views on the problems with the current
tax system and principles of reform. Other hearings will be held
this month in New York City in Harlem on Wednesday, September
20; at Howard University in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, September
26; and inner-city Cleveland, Ohio, September 27.
<P>
By the end of September, the Tax Reform Commission
will have held 12 public meetings.  The commission is determined
to &quot;listen first.&quot; It is holding this series of public
hearings to learn from the American people their frustrations,
fears, and concerns with the federal income tax system  as it
develops its recommendations.
<P>
Senate Leader Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich
have charged the 14-member commission with making recommendations
for a tax code that is &quot;flatter, fairer, and simpler&quot;
-- a system that will encourage economic growth and greater opportunity
for all Americans.
<P>
One of the most important aspects of the commission's
work is to talk with Americans from all walks of life -- small
business people, farmers, factory workers, inventors, and entrepreneurs
-- who make America work.
<P>
&quot;In all corners of the country, we have found
overwhelming anger and frustration with the current system, but
much more needs to be learned before Congress can move forward
with change,&quot; Chairman Kemp said.
<P>
The commission has been asked to study ways in which
the current tax code -- with its high marginal tax rates and thousands
of pages of rules, regulations, and red tape -- poses a barrier
to economic growth.
<UL>
<LI>It punishes the most dynamic forces for growth
in our economy -- the small business owners and entrepreneurs
who turn bold ideas into new businesses, new jobs, and new products.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>It discourages working Americans who are trying
to save for the future and to build a better life for themselves
and their families.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>It is endlessly complex and confusing, costing
literally billions of dollars in lost time and effort.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The commission hopes to present recommendations that
will make the tax code more family friendly and create incentives
for saving and investment. It hopes to help guide the tax reform
debate toward changes that will reinvigorate entrepreneurship,
risk taking, saving, investment, and work effort. It hopes to
contribute to changes that will make America more competitive
and expand the nation's worldwide leadership in the 21st century
economy. 
<P>
Among the issues it is studying:  What are the implications

<h3>TAX REFORM FIELD HEARING TO BE HELD IN CHARLOTTE,
SPONSORED BY THE NATIONAL COMMISSION 
ON ECONOMIC GROWTH AND TAX REFORM</h3>
</CENTER>

<P>
<P>
<blockquote><B>WASHINGTON, D.C. -</B> &quot;Designing a flatter, fairer and
simpler tax system that will encourage economic growth and greater
opportunity for all our people,&quot; is how Jack Kemp described
his goal as Chairman of the recently formed National Commission
on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, commonly referred to as the
Tax Reform Commission (TRC).  
<P>
Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole
(R-KS) have appointed Jack Kemp, co-Director of Empower America,
to chair the 14 member Commission consisting of leaders in both
the public and private sectors.  Kemp states the purpose of the
TRC is &quot;to study how major restructuring of our tax code
can help unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of Americans, grow
the economy without inflation and create greater opportunity for
people to escape poverty.&quot;  
<P>
In its first field hearing on July 19, Commission members gathered
in Boston to begin discussions on tax reform.  Over one hundred
business leaders, government representatives, and citizens attended
the hearing to share their views. On August 2nd the Commission

<h3>Tax Reform Commission Continues Public Hearings</h3>
</CENTER>

<P>
<blocquote>
The National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform continues
to hold weekly hearings to explore the problems with the current
tax code and principles for reform.  The commission's next public
hearing is being held Wednesday, July 26, in the Lehrman Auditorium
at The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., N.E.  It will
begin at 9:30 a.m. and is open to the public.
<P>
 &quot;We know far too much about what doesn't work, and we know
that those who are hurt most by bad public policies, especially
tax policy, are those at the bottom of the economic ladder,&quot;
said Commission Chairman Jack Kemp. 
<P>
&quot;While there is overwhelming anger and frustration with the
current system, we need to explore more about citizens' experiences
with problems and solutions before we can go forward with radical
change,&quot; he said.
<P>
For example, what are the implications to the economy of a steeply
progressive tax system? What is the impact on economic growth
of higher marginal tax rates? What do people mean whey they say
they want a &quot;fairer&quot; tax system?  What do we mean by
&quot;flatter&quot; tax rates?  &quot;There are many different
views, and we want to know what the American people think and
what are the ramifications of various options for change,&quot;
Kemp said.
<P>
The commission will develop recommendations designed to make the
tax code more family friendly and create incentives for saving
and investment. Members will focus on proposals to reinvigorate
entrepreneurship, risk taking, saving, investment, and work effort.
Their charge is to develop recommendations for changes that will
make America more competitive and expand the nation's worldwide
leadership in the 21st century economy. 
<P>
Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich, who created the Tax Reform
Commission,  asked commissioners to study ways in which the current
tax code -- with its &quot;high marginal tax rates and thousands
of pages of rules, regulations, and red tape -- poses a barrier
to economic growth.&quot; As they said:
<UL>
<LI>It punishes the most dynamic forces for growth in our economy
-- the small business owners and entrepreneurs who turn bold ideas
into new businesses, new jobs, and new products.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>It discourages working Americans who are trying to save for
the future and to build a better life for themselves and their
families.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>It is endlessly complex and confusing, costing literally billions
of dollars in lost time and effort.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
&quot;One of the most important aspects of our work is to talk
with Americans from all walks of life -- small business people,
farmers, factory workers, inventors, and entrepreneurs -- who
make America work. We will be holding hearings across the country
over the next several months to talk with taxpayers and to hear
from experts who study tax policy,&quot; said Commission Vice
Chairman Ed Feulner, President of the Heritage Foundation.
<P>
&quot;I am proud to serve with the distinguished men and women
on this commission who have offered to give of their time and
energy and talents so that all Americans can have a better chance
at the American dream,&quot; Kemp said.  &quot;Individually and
collectively, my colleagues on the commission have a huge font
of knowledge, experience, and courage that can help guide our
work.
<P>
&quot;We are setting the stage for a 21st century tax policy for
America,&quot; said Kemp.  &quot;It is imperative that everyone
work together to advance this monumental task.  What we are undertaking
may feel at times like moving a mountain. Making the tax code
simpler will be a very complicated process.
<P>
&quot;We hope that this series of hearings -- in which both citizens
and experts present views -- will help all of us to learn more
and to make better informed decisions about the hard choices that
lie ahead. If we can find the core, central principles of a new
vision for tax reform that includes everyone's views, we can get
this done. The American people -- and our children and grandchildren--
will be the winners,&quot; Kemp said.
<P>

<h3><center>COMMISSION GOAL - A FLATTER, FAIRER AND SIMPLER TAX SYSTEM</h3></center>

<p>
<p>
	<b>WASHINGTON, D.C., JUNE 14 --</b> "Designing a flatter, fairer and simpler tax system 
that will encourage economic growth and greater opportunity for all our people," is how Jack 
Kemp described his goal as Chairman of the recently formed National Commission on 
Economic Growth and Tax Reform.
<p>
"Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich had it exactly right," Kemp said, "when they 
announced the formation of the National Tax Reform Commission and said that the current 
federal tax code with its high marginal rates and thousands of pages of rules, regulations and 
red tape, poses a formidable barrier to economic growth.  It is quite frankly a disaster for 
everybody.  It is a system that needs not just reform but a complete overhaul.  We must 
concentrate on creating a tax code for the 21st century."
<p>
In his charge to the members of the National Tax Reform Commission Kemp said, "Tax 
reform must move toward making the tax code family friendly and create incentives for work, 
savings and entrepreneurship.  The congressional leadership has asked the National 
Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform to start with a blank piece of paper and 
design a system that is flatter, fairer and simpler -- one that will encourage strong economic 
growth and greater opportunity for all."
<p>
"The Commission will gather the views of American citizens from all walks of life and 
collect and analyze the best available analysis and evidence from the experts who study tax 
policy.  The Commission is expected to issue its recommendations and its report in December.  
The Commission’s report will provide recommendations that will contribute to reinvigorating 
entrepreneurship, risk-taking, savings, investment, and work efforts.  Our goal is to produce a 
report that will make America more competitive, expand the nation’s worldwide leadership in 
the 21st century global economy, and help eliminate, where they exist, any conditions of 
despair and poverty," Kemp said.
<p>
Commission members include Loretta H. Adams, President, Market Development, Inc.; 
J. Kenneth Blackwell, Ohio State Treasurer; Herman Cain, Chairman and CEO, Godfather’s 
Pizza, Inc.; Carroll A. Campbell, Jr., former Governor of South Carolina; Pete du Pont, former 
Governor of Delaware; Jack Faris, President and CEO, National Federation of Independent 
Business; Edwin J. Feulner, President, The Heritage Foundation; Matt Fong, California State 
Treasurer; Ted Forstmann, Partner, Forstmann Little & Co.; Dean R. Kleckner, President, 
American Farm Bureau Federation; Shirley D. Peterson, former IRS Commissioner; John 
Snow, Chairman, President and CEO, CSX Corporation; and John Wieland, President, John Wieland Homes, Inc.

<center><h2>Kemp vows fairness with tax reform ideas</h2>
<p>
GOP commission takes up alternatives</center>
<p>
(AP) -- Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp opened the first meeting of a Republican tax reform commission yesterday by promising to give fair consideration to the full range of proposals for overhauling the tax code.
<p>
Mr Kemp is a fan of a flat-rate income tax, but he said the 14 member commission, appointed by Senate
Majority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas and House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia, would evaluate a wide variety of ideas.
<p>
In addition to a flat tax proposed by House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas, he mentioned proposals for a consumption tax from Rep. Bill Archer of Texas chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee; a national sales tax from Sen. Richard G. Lugar of Indiana; and plans offered by House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, Missouri Democrat and Sen. Bill Bradley, New Jersey Democrat.
<p>
"It looks partisan. We're all men and women of the center-right of the spectrum," Mr. Kemp said of the
commission of business executives and former government officials. "I've taken stands, probably every one of us . . . has taken a stand on one sort of tax code or another We're going to approach it as open-minded as we humanly possibly, politically can."
<p>
Mr. Dole and Mr Gingrich asked Mr. Kemp to head the National Commission on Economic Growth and
Tax Reform two months ago; it is expected to issue its findings late this year in time for the presidential
primary elections.
<p>
"In no small way, this is the first day of the 21st century, at least in terms of taxes," Mr. Kemp said "This
.. . will be at the center of attention in '96 for the American people."
<p>
Republicans, who seized control of Congress last year for the first time in four decades, are hoping to make tax reform as powerful an issue in 1996 as tax reduction was in 1994.
<p>
"If Congress just stops at reducing taxes, then it will not have finished its job," Mr. Dole said at a news
conference at the start of the commission meeting "Americans . . . gave us control of Congress for the first time because they were fed up with the status quo. Now if there's one status quo that needs changing it's the federal tax code."
<p>
Mr. Gingrich said he is "really astonished by the intensity of resentment and irritation with the IRS."

<h4>Kemp Says Members Will Consider Variety of Reform Options</h4>
<p>
By Dave Skidmore<br>
Associated Press</center>
<p>
Former housing secretary Jack Kemp opened the first meeting of a Republican tax reform commission
yesterday promising to give fair consideration to the full range of proposals for overhauling the tax code.
<p>
Kemp has advocated a flat-rate income tax, but said the 14-member commission, appointed by Senate
Majority Leader Robert J. Dole (R-Kan.) and House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), would evaluate a 
wide variety of ideas.
<p>
In addition to a flat tax proposed by House Majority Leader Richard, K. Armey (R-Tex.), Kemp mentioned proposals for a consumption tax from House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-Tex.),  a national sales tax from Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-lnd.) and plans offered by House Minority Leader  Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) and Sen. Bill Bradley (D-NJ.).
<p>
"It looks partisan. We're an men and women of the center-right of the spectrum," Kemp said of the
commission of business executives and former government officials.  "I've taken stands, probably every one of us . . . has taken a stand on one sort of tax code or another. We're going to approach it as open minded as we humanly, possibly, politically can."
<p>
Dole and Gingrich asked Kemp to head the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform
two months ago and it is expected to issue its findings late this year, in time for the presidential primary 
elections.
<p>
"This . . . will be at the center of attention in '96 for the American people," Kemp said.
<p>
Republicans, who won control of Congress last year for the first time in four decades, are hoping to make tax reform as powerful an issue in 1996 as tax reduction was in 1994.
<p>
"If Congress just stops at reducing taxes, then it will not have finished its job," Dole said at a news
conference at the start of the commission meeting. "Americans . . . gave us control of Congress for the first time because they were fed up with the status quo. Now if there’s one status quo that needs changing it’s the federal tax code."

At a time when the new Reagan administration was finding its way in an often hostile capital city, The Times quickly established itself as an independent and influential voice that was willing to break the stories that the dominant Washington Post was not. <BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>By its second year of publication, the Associated Press listed The Times as the third most widely-quoted newspaper in the nation. President Reagan let it be known that The Washington Times was the first newspaper he read every morning. The Times was must reading for his successors as well, including especially President Clinton.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The implications of this aggressive and competitive presence in the press arena of the nation's capital have been far-reaching. The hundreds of bureau chiefs of American and foreign publications based in Washington, D.C. have since 1982 had more than one menu from which to select their leads. The House Banking Scandal and the Whitewater investigation are among the many stories The Times played a key role in bringing to the light of day.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Calling itself "America's Newspaper," The Times' editors make it a point not to mock the values of it readers. Editor in Chief Wesley Pruden often says he seeks the return of the days when newspaper people didn't put on airs and simply sought "to get the news first and get it right."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"At The Times we understand the enormous power of honest and hard-hitting reporting, the poetry of plain and straightforward language when it enlists in the cause of delivering information that people want and can actually use," Mr. Pruden said in a recent speech.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"We understand how words can both sing and sting, and move men and women to great deeds and occasionally move them to regret and even to repentance, especially when their reckless misdeeds are spread out across the top of Page One."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Now in its 14th year of publication, The Times has won hundreds of awards and has seen its circulation increase year after year at a time when the circulations of virtually all other major newspapers across the land are in decline. Since beginning publication in June 1994, the National Weekly Edition of The Times has been growing steadily and expects to reach 100,000 paid subscription level by year's end.</TD></TR></TABLE> <TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=12><TR ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top> <TD ALIGN=left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN="1" ROWSPAN="1"><IMG SRC="../images/vertical.gif" WIDTH=9 HEIGHT=280 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" border=0></TD></TR></TABLE> <TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=180><TR ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top><TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><FONT SIZE=4>For more information about The Times contact the telephone and e-mail addresses below:</FONT><B><center>Subscription Information:</B><BR>800-636-3699<BR><B>Newsstand availability:</B><BR>202-636-3332<BR><B>Advertising:</B><BR>202-636-4918<BR><B>Letters to the Editors:</B><BR><A HREF="mailto:nated@infi.net">nated@infi.net</A><BR><B>Editorial Queries:</B><BR><A HREF="mailto:rjmorton@aol.com">rjmorton@aol.com</A><BR><B>Circulation Queries:</B><BR><A HREF="mailto:natcirc@mci.mail.com">natcirc@mci.mail.com</A><BR>202-636-3310<BR><B>Editorial Fax:</B><BR>202-269-5934<BR><B>Internet Web Site:</B><BR><A HREF="http://www.WashTimes-Weekly.com">http://www.WashTimes-Weekly.com</center></A> </TD></TD></TABLE></TD></TD></TABLE><center><p><a href="#linkTOP">Go back to the top of this page.</A><BR><BR></center><center><B>This edition's highlights:<BR></B><A HREF="#linkTOP">Top Story</A> | <A HREF="culture.html">Culture</A> | <A HREF="exclusive.html">Exclusive</A> | <A HREF="../letters/letters.html">Letters</A> | <A HREF="../watch/watch.html">Watch</A> | <A HREF="../subscribe/subscribe.html">Subscribe</A><BR><B>Today's Washington Times:<FONT COLOR=#0C419A><BR></FONT></B><A HREF="http://www.washtimes.com/fullindex/fullindex.html#gen19">Whitewater</A> | <A HREF="http://www.washtimes.com">Front Page</A> | <A HREF="http://www.washtimes.com/politics/pruden.html">Pruden on Politics</A> | <A HREF="http://www.washtimes.com/politics/beltway.html">Inside the Beltway</A> | <A HREF="http://www.washtimes.com/opinion/ed.html">Top Editorial</A> | <A HREF="http://www.washtimes.com/opinion/fields.html">Suzanne Fields</A> </center><!-- This document was created using BeyondPress(TM) 2.0 -437058. --></BODY></HTML>

<I>Actual Course Descriptions</I><BR>
(Emphasis Added)</B>
<P>
<B>BROWN UNIVERSITY:
<P><I>Women's Studies 196b</B></I> <B><U>Christianity, 
Violence, and Victimization</B></U>  This seminar will 
examine historical and contemporary Christian 
theological perspectives on suffering and violence. 
While Christianity may be said to provide a remedy 
for evil, sin and suffering, contemporary critics, 
including feminist ones, argue the opposite: that 
<I>Christianity has helped to create and perpetuate 
a culture of violence, especially against women and 
other dispossessed persons</I>....  Attention will also be 
given to contemporary proposals for reconstructing Christian theology and ethics and transforming 
a culture of violence and abuse.
<P>
<P><B>CORNELL UNIVERSITY:
<P><I>Psychology 277 </I><U>The Social Construction 
of Gender</B></U>  This course addresses the very 
broad question of how an individual's gender and 
sexuality are constructed. Although some attention 
is given to biological perspectives, <I>the course 
emphasizes the social-psychological processes by which the 
culture transforms male and female newborns into 
&quot;masculine&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot; 
adults.</I> In addition to being quite interdisciplinary, the course is also 
oriented to <I>questioning the &quot;naturalness&quot; of not only 
masculinity and femininity, but exclusive heterosexuality 
as well.</I> Among some of the specialized topics 
discussed are psychological androgyny, egalitarian relationships, gender-liberated child rearing, 
the male centeredness of the work world, female 
sexuality, sexual harassment and homophobia. 
<P>
<P><B>AMHERST COLLEGE:
<P><I>Black Studies 53</B></I> <B><U>Black 
English</B></U>  An examination of the language of African-Americans. 
Topics will include the historical development of 
black English; a comparison of black English and 
standard American English features; a review of major theories of research on the language 
abilities of African-Americans; linguistic issues 
underlying the black English language/dialect controversy; 
the role of black English in creative expression; 
and the impact of black English on the social 
economic and education opportunities of African-Americans.
<P>
<P><B>GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY:
<P><I>English 134</B></I> <B><U>Prison 
Literature</B></U>  The United States has the highest per capita imprisonment 
rate in the world. Over four million people are on 
probation, parole, in jail or prison. In this context 
we will read a selection of literature by and about 
the imprisoned....  This course directly promotes 
service learning through community involvement with youth offender programs, ex-inmate 
organizations, criminal justice internships and 
prison tutoring programs. <I>Students will be asked to 
create an outreach that will join the incarcerated 
community with the community at large in order to help 
halt the &quot;prison mill.&quot; </I>
<P>
<P><B>UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN:
<P><I>Psychology 211</B></I> <B><U>Social 
Justice</B></U>  <I>Learn about racism, homophobia, sexism, rape, incest, domestic 
violence, eating disorders, substance abuse, the AIDS 
crisis, and teen pregnancy. </I>Develop supportive 
and helping relationships with people as they 
encounter special challenges throughout the life-span 
of teens through elderly, or <I>join with local 
agencies working to bring about change in the lives of people 
of color, women, gay men, and lesbians.</I>
<P>
<P><B>CHAPMAN UNIVERSITY:
<P><I>Peace Studies 341</B></I> <B><U>Reversing the Arms 
Race</B></U> Why did the U.S. and U.S.S.R. pursue a 
costly and ecocidal arms race in the wake of World 
War II? What are nuclear weapons and what threat 
do they pose to the planet? As the Cold War wanes, what dangers lie ahead due to the spread of 
weaponry? How might we all benefit from conversion from a military to a peacetime economy? How 
do we ensure national security while doing so? 
This course is a primer for citizenship in the 21st century.

<H2>Bizarre Leftist Themes Dominate College Classrooms</H2>

<B>Frivolous `Multicultural' Courses Demean the Value of a College Degree </B><BR>
An annual survey conducted by Young 
     America's Foundation reveals that, 
     students are being offered heavy doses 
     of Leftist indoctrination in their college courses.  The survey, which examines the 
curricula of the nation's top colleges and 
universities, found that the &quot;victim studies&quot; triad of 
race, gender, and class dominated the course 
offerings on all campuses, showing up in courses 
including &quot;Inequality:  Class, Race, and Gender,&quot; 
at Princeton; &quot;Race, Class, Gender, and Ethnicity 
in the City,&quot; at NYU; &quot;Race, Gender, and 
the Politics of Rock `n' Roll,&quot; at Columbia; and 
even &quot;Issues of Gender in Sport,&quot; at Brown.
<P>Young America's Foundation uncovers the farce of modern college curricula in its 
annual study, <I>Comedy and Tragedy:  College 
Course Descriptions and What They Tell Us About 
Higher Education Today</I>.  Now in its second edition, 
<I>Comedy and Tragedy</I> is an in-depth documentation of the efforts 
of radical Leftists to implement their ideology on 
the nation's top college campuses.
<P>With recent surveys showing over fifty percent of employers seeking 
highly-skilled college graduates, the curricula offered by 
the nation's leading universities is now more 
important than ever before.  With a job market 
stifled by government regulations, employers need 
to choose the next generation of the work-force with much care and attention.      
<P>An examination of what students are learning quickly reveals that 
many of today's colleges are not meeting the needs of the work-force or the 
students, because they do not provide the learning skills integral to life 
after graduation.  Today's curricula neglects our nation's founding 
principles in favor of pushing politically charged courses such as &quot;The History 
of Socialist Thought,&quot; and &quot;Feminist Reading, Lesbian Writing.&quot;  
<table align=right width="200" hspace="5">
<tr><td><IMG SRC="cornel.gif" ALT="Cornell West"  ><BR>
<B>Cornel West</B> of Harvard University is a self-avowed socialist who teaches courses such
as "The Thought of W.E.B. DuBois" in the school's Afro-American Studies Department</td>
</tr>
</table>
<P>When traditional fields of learning are covered, they are often 
covered from a Leftist perspective.  Such is the case with religion, as seen in 
Carleton College's &quot;Witches, Saints, and Seers;&quot; Fordham's &quot;Religion 
and Feminism;&quot; and Smith College's &quot;New Age America:  The Role 
of Mysticism in Secular Culture.&quot;  Christianity and other Western religions 
are almost always cast as being &quot;oppressive&quot; to minorities.  Observe Cornell's 
&quot;Gender and Sexuality in Early Christianity;&quot; or 
UPenn's &quot;The Historical Origins of Racism:  Views 
of Blacks in Early Judaism, Christianity, and 
Islam;&quot; and &quot;A Feminist Critique of Christianity.&quot;  
There are no reports of a course dealing with the &quot;Christian Critique of Feminism,&quot; however.  
<P>Even hard sciences, such as physics and biology, must yield to the forces of 
Political Correctness.  Princeton students can learn 
about &quot;Gender and Science,&quot; which offers a 
&quot;feminist critique of scientific knowledge.&quot;  
Dartmouth College explores &quot;the wider implications of 
the contemporary critique of rational, binary, hierarchical, and patriarchal thinking&quot; in a 
course called &quot;Ways of Knowing:  Physics, 
Literature, Feminism.&quot;  Science also seems to be affected 
by the racial politics of multiculturalism, 
warranting an examination of &quot;Afrocentric Health 
Care Systems&quot; at Emory University.  
<P>These frivolous courses have now spread to all types of schools, 
from large State-run universities to small liberal arts colleges.  
Amherst College offers &quot;Taking Marx Seriously,&quot; 
for example.  The University of Georgia hopes to 
educate its students in the &quot;History and Analysis of 
Rock Music.&quot;  &quot;Freud, Fairy Tales, and Feminism&quot; is an 
official course at UCLA, and Fordham University offers a course 
simply entitled:  &quot;Victimology.&quot; 
<table align=left width="200" hspace="5">
<tr><td><IMG SRC="cartoon.gif" ALT="Cartoon" ><BR>
<B>Students <I>and </I>employers</B> are beginning to realize that college 
diplomas aren't worth much when students are taking &quot;victim studies&quot; courses 
such as Notre Dame's &quot;Economics of Gender and Ethnic Discrimination.&quot;<BR>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<P>
Classes that often offend a student's morals, upbringing, or religion are common fare 
in today's colleges, such as &quot;The History of 
Witchcraft and Magic,&quot; at Rutgers University, and 
a course drawing parallels between 
&quot;Christianity, Violence, and Victimization&quot; at Brown.
<P>
<I>Comedy and Tragedy </I>allows those outside 
of the Ivory Tower walls to see inside for themselves.  This study is especially helpful for 
concerned alumni, as they cannot rely upon the sterilized alumni publications of their alma 
mater to expose the proliferation of these bizarre classes.

On August 14, 1983 a seventeen year old Afghan Freedom Fighter spoke to Young 
America's Foundation's summer conference. He told of his struggle, including suffering the loss of 
his family and being personally maimed by the Soviet troops that invaded his country.
<P>The following day, Monday, August 15, a group of American students, led by 
<B>Floyd Brown</B> of Washington and <B>Will 
Faron</B> of Florida, staged a protest against the Soviet invasion in 
front of the Soviet compound in Washington. Many news cameras were already on site to cover 
a hoped-for defection of the son of the KGB chief who was being held hostage in 
the compound. This combination of events garnered the conservatives national 
television coverage.
<P>Brown and Faron were arrested and prosecuted for their &quot;political&quot; 
anti-Communist demonstration even though no individuals were ever prosecuted for the many 
anti-South Africa demonstrations in front of that embassy. The D.C. government claimed it 
was &quot;untenable&quot; to prosecute 
<I>those</I> demonstrators. Hundreds of Leftists had violated the 
same law including the Kennedys, Jesse Jackson, Amy Carter, and former U.S. Attorney 
General Ramsey Clark, and yet not a single liberal was prosecuted! Brown and Faron were 
thrown into the D.C. Central jail with hardened criminals and denied any opportunity to plea bargain.

<B>Bridget Brooker</B>, and George Washington University YAF leader 
<B>Michael Waller </B> filed a Federal action, <I>Boos v. Barry, 
</I>to halt the fifty year ban of demonstrations against Communist embassies. They lost at the district and 
appellate court hearings but the inconsistency of the government was gaining increased attention. 
<P>Finally, on March 22, 1988 the United States Supreme 
Court found that the young conservatives' Constitutional 
rights were violated. In a 5 to 3 decision written by 
Justice <B>Sandra Day O'Connor</B>, the Court held 
that &quot;our own citizens must tolerate insulting, and even outrageous, speech in order to 
provide adequate breathing space to freedoms protected by the 
First Amendment.&quot; 
<P>Brown's and Faron's convictions were overturned and 
the fifty years of the State Department protecting 
Communist governments from the free expression of the 
American people was over. The American Bar Association later called 
it one of the most important decisions of the Supreme Court.<BR>

<P>&quot;NEWT! NEWT! NEWT!&quot; chanted the three hundred student leaders as longtime Young America's 
Foundation lecturer, and newly installed Speaker of the House, 
<B>Newt Gingrich</B> entered the Cannon Caucus Room for 
a triumphant Foundation banquet. The July 26, 1995 event was carried by all major television networks and 
was followed by the Speaker signing copies of his book,
<I>To Renew America, </I>for Young America's 
Foundation students.

In early 1991 America was heading toward war in the Persian Gulf 
because of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Students seemed eager to support 
American troops and not follow the 1960s model when campus-based Leftists 
undermined America's armed forces. But college administrators were hostile to 
any patriotic sentiments. Some campuses, such as the University of 
Maryland, banned any display of the American flag!
<P>Young America's Foundation would have nothing to do 
with this &quot;political correctness&quot; and helped organize support 
for America's soldiers. An exemplary rally was held at Washington 
and Lee University by Foundation W&amp;L leader 
<B>Marc Short</B> and University of Virginia campus 
activist <B>Kate Obenshain</B>. They brought 
former Vietnam POW Admiral <B>Jeremiah Denton</B> onto campus for the first 
time since his imprisonment in the North Vietnamese &quot;Hanoi Hilton.&quot; The 
student response was spirited, with thousands of flag-waving students responding with 
the strongest patriotic fervor seen on campus in decades.

A similar rally, but this time a post-Persian Gulf war

Director <B>James Lacy</B> and staffer <B>Peter 
Schweizer</B> at Chapman University. Gulf war hero General 
<B>Norman Schwarzkopf</B> addressed over 3,000 supportive students while many 
of the Chapman faculty protested outside. General Schwarzkopf 
put an end to the &quot;Vietnam war syndrome&quot; that cast 
American military leaders in the role of villains. Norman took 
the country, and the campus, by storm--giving a real 
life example of why he is called Stormin' Norman!<BR>

Young America's Foundation leaders <B>Frank

renowned Conservative Political Action Conferences (CPACs) in the 
mid-1970s when they were leaders in Young Americans for Freedom.

<B>Ronald Reagan</B> was showcased at these conferences and its participants 
were looking forward to the March 1981 CPAC when newly elected 
President Reagan would again address CPAC.
<P>Young America's Foundation was a co-sponsor of the dinner, 
Foundation Director <B>James Lacy </B>was the master 
of ceremonies, and key Foundation supporters, including 
<B>John Engalitcheff</B>, were on hand for that electric 
night. Reagan chronicled the history of the conservative movement in one of his 
most moving speeches. Ronald Reagan has had a long and close affiliation with 
Young America's Foundation, but that March 20, 1981 evening at 
Washington's Mayflower Hotel was truly special.
<P>Nine days later, at a nearby Washington hotel, President Reagan was shot 
by John Hinckley. John Engalitcheff would later suffer a fatal stroke at a White 
House event with President Reagan. Mr. Engalitcheff would later become 
Young America's Foundation's most generous supporter by donating an eight 
million dollar bequest. But that CPAC dinner brought these key leaders together in 
the Conservative Movement's greatest night of celebration. <BR>

The lecture program has always been the cornerstone of 
the Foundation's student outreach effort.  Over the years, these 
lectures have transformed America's campuses as Young America's Foundation lecturers 
have garnered increasingly large audiences.
<P><B>William F. Buckley, Jr.</B>, the &quot;godfather&quot; of the young conservative 
movement, consistently draws large and enthusiastic audiences. His speech at the University 
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on April 20, 1993 was particularly notable.

<P><B>Jesse Jackson </B>had just spoken at Chapel Hill on behalf of a controversial proposal 
to establish a separate African-American center. Over 750 students heard 
Reverend Jackson in what was, at that point, the largest event on campus. 
Conservatives needed one of their heroes to answer.
<P>One week later Bill Buckley was scheduled to speak in the same hall. 
Young America's Foundation supplemented its usual promotions 
with advertisements on a local <B>Rush Limbaugh 
</B>affiliate. Over 1,700 people crammed into the lecture hall, 
and hundreds more were turned away, as Bill Buckley's lecture 
won the audience over and became <I>the</I> event on campus that year!<BR>

In November of 1995, Young America's Foundation celebrated its 25th 
anniversary with a banquet attended by the campus and national leaders that have made 
the Foundation the most effective student outreach organization in the country.
<P>Helping the Foundation celebrate a quarter-century of defending 
conservative principles on campus were key student leaders, longtime Foundation supporters, 
and several Foundation lecturers. The evening featured inspirational speeches by 
75th Attorney General <B>Edwin Meese</B> and Lt. Col. 
<B>Oliver North</B>, a patriotic song from Congressman 
<B>Dana Rohrabacher</B>, and the presentation of the 
<B>John Engalitcheff Award </B>to University of Pennsylvania professor 
<B>Alan Kors </B>for his dedication to fighting political correctness in higher education.  The banquet and speeches 
were carried to a nationwide audience by C-SPAN.
<P>Founded in 1969 by students at Vanderbilt University, Young 
America's Foundation has assisted hundreds-of-thousands of young Americans over 
the years.  At the banquet, the Foundation presented all guests with a

National Journalism Center President <B>M. Stanton 
Evans</B> addressed a group of students, professors, and 
Foundation supporters who gathered in Chicago on April 25, 1992. 
Evans' topic, &quot;Religion, Politics, and the American Tradition&quot; was 
timely and the address was well received. What the intimate crowd 
that evening didn't know was that the reception they gave Evans 
would lead him to write his next major book, <I>The Theme is Freedom, 
</I>and that he would eventually deliver a similar lecture on more 
than twenty-five campuses and at several subsequent Foundation banquets.
<P>Evans' <I>The Theme is Freedom</I> became a major contribution to 
the debate that raged throughout the 1990s about the proper 
balance between government and religion and the role of our 
religious traditions in establishing modern freedom.<BR>

<P>In 1992, as president of the Grover Hermann Foundation,  Mrs. Hermann established 
with Young America's Foundation an annual lecture series bearing her late husband's name.

 The two were married in 1945 and founded the Grover 
Hermann Foundation in the 1950s.  Mrs. Hermann became the foundation's president upon the death of her 
husband in 1979.  The Hermanns were early supporters 
of the conservative movement, and continued their support 
throughout their lives.  In addition to her support 
of Young America's Foundation programs, Mrs. Hermann also served as an Honorary Trustee

Young America's Foundation is pleased to announce 
     the <I>Sarah T. Hermann Scholarship </I>intern program, 
     created in memory of one of the Foundation's most 
     loyal supporters.  The purpose of this program is 
to develop a cadre of young conservative leaders for our 
country through the hands-on experience that only an internship 
can provide.  The program will also provide direct financial 
assistance to these interns, who will be chosen from among 
the Foundation's finest student leaders.
<P>Young America's Foundation will seek out 
motivated students to serve as semester- or summer-long interns.  
Student leaders selected as <I>Hermann </I>interns will conduct 
original research on campus issues to be published and distributed 
as issue briefs.  <I>Sarah T. Hermann </I>interns will also be involved 
in planning Foundation conferences and lectures, and will, in 
the course 
of their duties, be encouraged to become more involved in 
the Conservative Movement and expand their knowledge 
of conservative and free market ideas and principles.
<P>In the past, many of the Foundation's most 
dedicated student activists have been former interns.  Now, through 
the generosity of the Grover Hermann Foundation, 
Young America's Foundation will be able to greatly increase 
the number of students participating as Foundation interns, 
and will simultaneously help to strengthen America's next 
generation of leaders.

<h3><a name="quayle"></a>Quayle Addresses Thousands of Students at Foundation Lectures</h3><p>
<b>Vice-President Draws 1100 at Southeast Missouri State and 900 at Northwestern</b><p>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]</center><P>
In a matter of hours, all 900 tickets made                available to students at Northwestern      
          University were taken by young people      
          eager to hear former Vice-President 
<B>Dan Quayle</B>.
<P>&quot;The demand was much greater than we anticipated,&quot; remarked 
<B>Kevin Frost</B>, the Northwestern student who coordinated the 
event with Young America's Foundation.  &quot;This 
was truly a great speech,&quot; he added.  &quot;There 
aren't many events on campus when tickets are all taken within hours and the crowd is as 
enthusiastic as this one was tonight.&quot;
<P>This spring, Mr. Quayle has addressed standing-room-only crowds at 
Northwestern University and Southeast Missouri State 
University, speaking on the values and principles upon which our country is built, and 
the qualities and characteristics our national 
leaders need to possess.
<P>&quot;Character <I>does </I>matter,&quot; the former 
Vice-President assured students.  &quot;The 
American people today simply want to have a 
president who will tell the truth.  It's that simple.&quot;
<P>The Quayle speech was greatly anticipated by students at both campuses.  
Young America's Foundation has found that students are eager to hear conservative and free 
market ideas and will turn out enthusiastically 
when given the opportunity.  Many students are now beginning to protest when their professors 
and administrators exclusively promote Leftist 
ideas on campus.  Prior to Mr. Quayle's Northwestern University speech, many students 
expressed these very sentiments:
<P>Northwestern student <B>Jason Goch </B>was one of many students who was anxious to hear 
an alternative message, saying that he hoped that Mr. Quayle would &quot;provide a bit of balance 
to the overwhelming number of liberal speakers who are brought here.&quot;
<P>Student <B>Danny Rashburn</B>, who serves as the head of Northwestern's student 
Senate, commented that even though he considered 
himself a liberal, he was anxious to hear Mr. Quayle speak. 
 &quot;I'm pretty involved with politics and I 
don't really know much of what he stands for because 
the media has developed an image of him that preceded 
all of his politics,&quot; he admitted.  &quot;I'm 
interested in seeing not only what he stands for but whether or not 
that image is correct.  It will definitely be one of 
the most memorable events for me.&quot;
<P>In his speech before 1100 students at Southeast Missouri State, Mr. Quayle 
stressed the need for a less burdensome tax system, 
and the need for our country to dismantle the welfare system.
<P>
&quot;I'm not talking about just reforming [the welfare system],&quot; Mr. Quayle declared.  
&quot;Some people say that all we need is to tinker with 
it on the edges, just a little reform.  Well, 
forget it.  It doesn't work.  It doesn't help the 
homeless, doesn't help the poor, and doesn't help 
the disadvantaged.  The system is a destroyer of families.  It penalizes marriages, it 
discourages work and it subsidizes illegitimacy.  What 
kind of system is that?  We have unfortunately created a culture of dependency, where we need a culture of opportunity.&quot; 
<P>Vice-President Quayle is just one of the highlights of the Foundation's spring 
lecture program which features such prominent 
figures as Supreme Court Justice <B>Clarence 
Thomas</B> at Southeast Missouri State on April 30, 
<B>William F. Buckley</B> at Weber State University on 
April 18, <B>Jack Kemp</B> at Loyola 
University-Chicago on April 24, <B>Edwin Meese</B> at the University

<h3><a name="cong"></a>Congressional Leaders Play an Integral Part in Foundation Programs</h3><p>
<BR>
<B>Foundation Vice-President, Ron Pearson, Provides Valuable Link to Capitol Hill</B><p>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]</center><P>
Since its inception 27 years ago, 
     Young America's Foundation has 
     sought to bring a conservative, free 
     market message to America's college students.  An essential part of this 
outreach mission is allowing students to hear, 
firsthand, the thoughts and principles espoused by 
our country's greatest leaders and thinkers.  Over the years, Young America's Foundation 
has been fortunate to develop close working relationships with many of America's most 
distinguished congressional leaders, and has been able to bring their valuable messages to 
students, who represent the next generation of national leaders.
<P>Each summer, at the Foundation's National Conservative Student Conference, 
attending students are treated to a Congressional 
Briefing featuring conservative legislators from both 
the House and Senate.  In past years, students 
have been able to meet and hear from figures such as Speaker <B>Newt Gingrich</B>, Senate 
Majority Leader <B>Robert Dole</B>, Senator <B>Phil 
Gramm</B>, House Majority Leader <B>Dick Armey</B>, 
Senate Majority Whip <B>Trent Lott</B>, 
Conservative Democratic Forum founder 
Representative <B>Charles Stenholm</B>, and Senator 
<B>Jesse Helms</B>, to name just a few.  The Foundation's 
Congressional Briefing is often carried on C-SPAN, 
and last summer, a special Foundation luncheon with Speaker Gingrich was covered by 
NBC, ABC, and CBS.  
<P>This briefing is organized each year by the Foundation's vice-president, 
<B>Ron Pearson</B>, who served as chief of staff to 
Representative <B>John Ashbrook </B>and Representative 
<B>Bill Dannemeyer</B> before opening his own 
political management and government relations 
consulting firm on Capitol Hill.  Mr. Pearson notes that he tries 
to find congressmen who might have a wider appeal 
to students than simply just as a &quot;politician.&quot;  
<P>&quot;I try to identify congressmen who would have 
an interesting message for college students.  That's one of the 
first things I look at,&quot; says Mr. Pearson.  &quot;I 
try to look at freshman members and newer members who 
might be of interest, and that's how I first started 
inviting Congressman Gingrich almost seven years ago.  
Although he was known as a `backbencher' back then, he really wasn't.  He was a leader 
in the House as far as having some strong ideas on how to take control of 
the Congress.  He was also very active on issues in Congress.  So I started 
inviting him because I thought he would be of special interest to the students, and 
also because he was a college professor before he became a congressman.&quot;
<P>Many of the most popular speakers at the Foundation's Congressional 
Briefing share an academic background.  In addition to Speaker Gingrich, who 
was once a history professor at West Georgia College, other former professors 
include Senator Gramm, Representative Armey, and Representative 
<B>Phil Crane</B>, who has spoken before Foundation audiences 
for more than 15 years.  Congressman Armey notes that his experiences as 
a college professor give him a great understanding of the unique service that 
Young <BR>

<HR>
<blockquote>
<B>&quot;I have worked closely with Young America's Foundation over the years 
and have found their commitment to promoting balance, academic 
integrity, and free market values on campuses is unsurpassed.  If students are 
serious about effectively challenging the liberal monopoly on campus, they must 
contact Young America's Foundation.&quot;
<P> Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich</B><BR>
</blockquote>
<HR>
America's Foundation conferences provide.  &quot;As a former professor myself, I know 
the challenge that these students face on college campuses,&quot; he acknowledges.  &quot;The work 
of Young America's Foundation is a useful antidote to the usual liberal litany on the 
college campus.&quot;
<P>Above all, Mr. Pearson looks for speakers that are activist leaders and who have 
bold ideas and a strong message.  When asked what sets these leaders apart from the rest, he 
replied that he seeks legislators who &quot;want to come 
to Congress to <I>do things</I>, rather than just come 
to Congress.  They have some idea in mind of 
<I>why</I> they were elected to Congress and what 
they want to accomplish.  They have some specific ideas, not just, `Well, I want to make 
things better.'  You can usually tell when members 
get to Congress, in their first couple years, if they're going to be active or inactive.&quot;
<P>Mr. Pearson also recruits speakers whose lives can serve as an inspiration to students. 
 One such speaker, Representative <B>Chris Cox</B> 
of California, is an excellent role model for students.  &quot;When Chris was in law school,&quot; 
Mr. Pearson explains, &quot;he was working on his 
MBA at the same time he was working on his Law degree, and he was also one of the editors 
of the <I>Harvard Law Review</I>.&quot;  Mr. Pearson 
points out that congressmen such as Chris Cox, 
<B>Dana Rohrabacher</B>, and <B>Mark Souder</B> were 
conservative activists as students and &quot;have 
remained conservative activists in Congress.&quot;
<P>Mr. Pearson also has advice for students wishing to pursue careers on Capitol Hill: 
 &quot;The important thing is to get involved 
early, as a student, get involved on a 
philosophical basis.  Be well educated and well read.  So 
you not only have a knowledge of the issues, but also 
the philosophy behind them.  It gives you a much wider 
background and better grasp of the process and lets you 
handle issues much easier; particularly if you want to work in 
a congressional office.
<P>&quot;As a student, it is also important to be involved, 
by bringing speakers to campus, by sponsoring the 
programs that the Foundation encourages, because that helps to 
develop the skills that are necessary to succeed in any field.&quot;

<B><a name="rotc"></a>New Law Prohibits Defense Department Funding of Schools that Discriminate Against ROTC </b><BR>
<h3>Foundation, ROTC Students Defeat Campus Leftists</h3>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]</center><P>
Young America's Foundation activists scored a major victory  on February 10, when the ROTC Campus Access Act was signed into law by the President.  The legislation, which cuts off Department of Defense funding to colleges and 
universities that ban the Reserve Officer Training Corps was part of this year's 
Defense Authorization Act.  It was introduced following a public information 
campaign, conducted by Young America's Foundation, designed to expose 
unfair discrimination against ROTC cadets and bolsters the right of students to 
participate in ROTC on their campuses.
<P>The law marks a huge defeat for campus radicals intent on 
denying students the right to participate in military programs on campus.  
Historically, the ROTC program has assisted economically disadvantaged 
students, providing scholarships for those willing to make a commitment to serve 
their country.  By limiting access to ROTC, many academics who purport to 
promote diversity and educational opportunity have in reality undermined these ideals. 
 Many poor and middle class students are able to afford the costly price of higher 
education solely because of the financial assistance 
ROTC provides. <B> Colin Powell</B>, Secretary of 
Education <B>Richard Reilly</B>, Senator <B>Strom 
Thurmond</B>, and former senator and current University of Oklahoma President 
<B>David Boren</B> are a few of the many 
distinguished Americans who benefited from the 
ROTC program.
<P>The first massive wave of expulsions of ROTC programs dates back to the 
Vietnam War, when radical activists forced the 
military off campus through protests, violent 
demonstrations, and even bombings.  Today, many of those same 1960s protesters now call the 
shots on campus as faculty and administrators, 
using the armed forces' &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; 
policy on homosexuals as a pretense to prevent students from participating in ROTC. 
<P>Many Young America's Foundation supporters will remember the story of 
<B>Flagg Youngblood </B>and the persecution that he 
and his fellow ROTC cadets at Yale University faced.  Banned from meeting on their 
own campus by leftist faculty and administrators, Yale's cadets are forced to travel 65 miles to 
the nearest ROTC unit if they wish to participate 
in the program.  Not only does this policy cut off educational opportunities for students and 
deny the armed forces the quality officers it 
deserves, it also endangers the lives of students 
who choose to defend our country.  Three times in the past two years cadets making the trip to 
the distant campus have been involved in serious car accidents.  These accidents were 
attributed to slick New England winter roads and 
exhausted cadets falling asleep at the wheel.  
This is all happening while Yale's faculty and 
administrators solicit and accept Department of Defense research grants and contracts. 
<P>Sadly, Yale's hypocritical stance of banning ROTC while accepting defense funds is 
followed by a number of other schools including Harvard, Stanford, Columbia, and Brown 
to name a few.  
<P>After Young America's Foundation disseminated these disturbing facts to the 
general public, members of Congress began taking action against academia's 
pervasive anti-military policies.  This educational campaign included 
appearances on over 20 talk shows, including National Empowerment Television's 
<I>Capitol Watch</I>, where Foundation staffers described the discrimination members 
of the armed forces face on campus.  A petition drive succeeded in alerting 
tens of thousands of Americans to the problems patriotic students serving 
their country encounter as a result of leftist faculty and administrators.  
<P>An education campaign by Young America's Foundation activists both 
on Capitol Hill and through the mail resulted in Congressman 
<B>Richard Pombo</B> introducing the ROTC Campus Access Act.  Revealing op/ed 
articles written by Foundation Program Officer <B>Dan Flynn 
</B>for <I>The Washington Times</I> and <I>Human 
Events</I>  the latter of which was read from on the floor of the 
House of Representatives by Congressman <B>Jack 
Kingston</B>  provided much of the information used in debate against 
anti-military colleges and universities.
<P>With the passage of the ROTC Campus Access Act, ROTC supporters look to 
the future with much optimism, citing the example of a 1993 law which cut off Defense funds 
for schools that banned military recruiters from meeting with students on campus. 
Following the passage of that legislation, all but one of 
the 140 colleges and universities which had previously banned military recruiters opened 
their doors rather than risk a loss of funding.  It 
is uncertain whether any school will continue to ban ROTC 
and risk losing millions of dollars in grants and 
contracts.
<P>Commenting on the success of this type of strategy, 
Young America's Foundation President <B>Ron 
Robinson </B>explained, &quot;While left-wing 
academics may not listen to reason, they often listen 
when the flow of money, the lifeline of many colleges 
and universities, is jeopardized.&quot;<BR>

<BR>
<B>Conservative Political Action Conference Luncheon Features Radio, T.V. Host Armstrong Williams</B><P>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]</center><P>

&quot;Personal responsibility.  Economic independence.  Thrift.  The work ethic.  Optimism.  Hope.  Ambition.  Enthusiasm.  Perseverance.  Pride... These are some of the many values my parents taught their children...&quot;  And they are some of the many ideals <B>Armstrong 
Williams</B> imparted to his <B>student audience of 300</B> at a recent Young America's Foundation's luncheon. Armstrong Williams is the host of two nationally syndicated radio programs, 
<I>The Right Side</I> and <I>The Armstrong Williams  Show</I>, and a weekly program which airs on 
National Empowerment Television.  His columns frequently appear in <I>Reader's Digest </I>and <I>USA Today</I>, and run nationally on the  <I>L.A. Times</I> Syndicate.  He is the author of 
<I>Beyond Blame:  How We Can Succeed by Breaking the Dependency Barrier</I>, and also serves as the CEO of a Washington D.C. based public relations firm.
<P>Mr. Williams' message of personal responsibility and the importance of family 
resonated with the students and was met with fervent applause as he stated, &quot;Families are the 
first, best departments of Health, Education, and Welfare.  Our policies must assist families, rather than punish marriage and reward promiscuity.  Our policies should encourage industry, rather than reward indolence.  Our laws should be equally and fairly applied to all Americans, offering opportunity to all, and special treatment to no one, be they wealthy or poor, man or woman, black, white or brown.&quot;
<P>Held annually in Washington, D.C., the Foundation's CPAC luncheon attracts 
student leaders from across the nation.  <B>Tina 
Tran</B>, a student from UCLA, thought Armstrong Williams' speech &quot;was absolutely fantastic!&quot;  Loyola College student <B>Sergio Vitale</B> was 
so inspired by Mr. Williams' message that he is already making plans to sponsor him on 
campus next fall.  &quot;Armstrong Williams' speech 
was by far the best event in the whole CPAC line-up!&quot; raved Sergio.
<P>Deeply proud of the liberties we cherish in America, Armstrong Williams impressed 
upon the students that, &quot;Freedom is not free.  
It requires as much exertion to maintain it as to establish it.  Especially in a free nation, 
every citizen has certain duties:  to him-self, his family, and to his 
fellow countrymen.  Freedom requires risks, but 
its rewards are great.&quot;<BR>

Court finds University of Virginia Committed "Viewpoint Discrimination"</h4>[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]<P></center></center>
<p>
On June 29, in a dramatic victory for students on campuses, the Supreme Court vindicated what conservatives have been arguing for years: universities are not permitted to treat religious speech as second class speech. In <i>Rosenberger v. Rector and the Visitors of the University of Virginia</I>, the Court determined that the University of Virginia discriminated against a Christian student newspaper when it denied the paper equal access to student activity fees. Young America's Foundation Program Officer <b>Ron Rosenberger</B>, who had founded the magazine, <i>Wide Awake</I>, while a student and Foundation activist at the University of Virginia, was the plaintiff in the case.
<p>
Mr. Rosenberger said, "The decision puts an end to the double standard used in university funding of student groups and guarantees a free marketplace of ideas on campuses across the country."
<p>
The Supreme Court case grew out of a 1991 decision by the University of Virginia to deny funds to a Christian publication due to its content. This decision came despite the fact that the university funded Jewish and Muslim groups on the basis of their being "cultural" activities. Funds were also granted to 116 other student groups, including Students for Animal Rights, the National Organization of Women, and several homosexual advocacy groups. Believing that he had been denied equal access to student activity fees,  Mr. Rosenberger, a Young America's Foundation activist, took his school to court.
<p>
The Supreme Court decided on the side of Christian students and Wide Awake. In a damning indictment of current university practices nationwide, Justice <B>Anthony M. Kennedy</b> wrote for the majority: "For the university, by regulation, to cast disapproval on particular viewpoints of its students risks the suppression of free speech and creative inquiry in one of the vital centers for nation's intellectual life, the college and university campuses."
<p>
Justice Kennedy argued that the most offensive aspect of UVa's position was that it monitored the content of student publications: "The viewpoint discrimination inherent in the university's regulation required public officials to scan and interpret student publications to discern their underlying philosophic assumptions reciting religious theory and belief.
<p>
"That course action," he continued, was a denial the right of be speech and would risk fostering
a pervasive bias or hostility to religion, which could undermine the very neutrality the Establishment Clause requires. There is no Establishment Clause violation in the University's honoring its duties under the Free Speech Clause."
<p>
In his dissent, Justice <b>David Souter</b> rationalized the university's position by stressing the religious content of the magazine. He quoted certain passages and cited the "frankly evangelistic character of the magazine" as justification for the university's actions.
<p>
Justice Kennedy took issue with the dissent, writing that Justice Souter's position would raise "the specter of governmental censorship, to ensure that all student writing and publications meet some baseline standard of secular orthodoxy. To impose that standard on student speech at a university is to imperil the very sources of free speech and expression.... official censorship would be far more inconsistent with the Establishment Clause's dictates than would governmental provision of secular printing services on a religion-blind basis."
<p>
In a concurring opinion, Justice <b>Clarence Thomas</b> wrote, "Though our Establishment Clause jurisprudence is in hopeless disarray, this case provides an opportunity to affirm one basic principle that has enjoyed an uncharacteristic degree of consensus: The Clause does not compel the exclusion of religious groups programs that are generally available to a broad class of participants."
<p>
Citing the intent of the Founding Fathers, Justice Thomas wrote, "The dissent identifies as evidence that the Framers intended to disable religious entities from participating on neutral terms in evenhanded government programs....Even if Madison believed that the principle of non-establishment of religion precluded government financial support for religion per se, there is no indication that at the time of the framing he took the dissent's extreme view that the government must discriminate against religious adherents by excluding them from more generally available financial subsidies."
<p>
Justice <b>Sandra Day O'Connor</b>, also concurring, wrote, "By withholding from Wide Awake assistance that the University provides generally to all other student publications, the University has discriminated on the
basis of the magazine's religious viewpoint in violation of the Free Speech Clause." Justice O'Connor relied on the principle of government's neutrality toward religion as the Court "held that schools may not discriminate against religious groups by denying them equal access to facilities that the schools make available to all."
<p>
She noted that widely divergent expressions of viewpoints are funded by the university, therefore there is no danger of any one opinion being perceived to be that of the university. She wrote, "Besides the general new publications, for example, the University has provided support to <I>The Yellow Journal</I>, a humor magazine that has targeted Christianity as a subject of satire, and <i>Al-Salam</I>, a publication to 'promote a better understanding of Islam to the University Community."'
<p>
Justice O'Connor opened the door to a challenge of the compulsory student activities fees "by an objecting student that she should not be compelled to pay for speech with which she disagrees."

of Rosenberger Decision</a></h3>
<h4>"Subdued Celebration" Urged In Wake of Supreme Court</h4>[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]<P></center><P>
One day after the landmark Supreme Court decision supporting the rights of religious students on campus, over 125 students from more than 50 colleges and universities gathered in the nation's capital for a conference sponsored by Young America's Foundation. The conference, held on June 30, highlighted the case's ramifications for college students and informed campus activists of their rights of free speech on campus.
<p>
The lead plaintiff in the case, Foundation Program Officer <b>Ron Rosenberger</b>, opened the conference, saying, "The Supreme Court sent a message loud and clear that it is unconstitutional to treat religious students as second-class citizens or religious speech as second-class speech. Publicly funded colleges and universities will no longer be able to exclude religious groups from benefits that are made available to a wide array of student groups."
<p>
Two student panels, composed of students who have been subjected to similar harassment at their schools, spoke to conference attendees. <b>Bryson Koehler</b>, a student at the University of North Carolina and editor of the independent student newspaper there, the Carolina Review, related the tale of his magazine's defunding by the school. The school found the Review "to be politically partisan" due to a picture of Jefferson Davis in the paper. Ironically, the school funds the Daily Tar Heel which ran a page devoted to the endorsement of political candidates. The Daily Tar Heel has come under no scrutiny from the funding agencies of the school. Mr. Koehler will follow Ron Rose Iberger's example and take his case to the Federal District Court in North Carolina.
<p>
<b>Morgan Knull</b>, a junior at Wabash College in Indiana and an intern with Young America's Foundation, said students have to be willing to "stand up and face public ridicule. There will be other students who are sympathetic, but you have to go against the grain." He went on against the grain." He went on to say that at most campuses today, "Liberals are like vampires lurking around at night: You have to expose them."
<p>
Mr. Knull told of the abuse with which religious students must contend at Wabash. The professor of a course in human sexuality showed the movie, 120 Days of Sodom, to his class and others "as a statement against the religious right." The movie, which has been banned in Italy and France for its obscenity, was deemed appropriate and necessary for students to view by the leftist professor. Mr. Knull stood up to his professor and challenged the appropriateness of the movie being shown in class. After bringing Mr. Knull up on harassment charges, the professor eventually dropped all charges and admitted that he should not have shown the film.
<p>
Mr. Knull exhorted students: "Don't water down your beliefs. I stand up for what I believe in because I love my school and want it to become again the institution of academic vigor that it used to be. Take your message outside your school if you need to.  Get involved with national groups which can help you, such as Young America's Foundation."
<p>
Syndicated columnist <b>Joseph Sobran</b> spoke to the conference, giving students a sobering perspective on the significance of the Rosenberger decision in its jurisprudence and historical context. He said many of the current problems conservative students face stem from the 16th Amendment which gave the federal government the power to levy income taxes. He said, "Direct taxing power gave enormous power to the federal government and, in effect, neutralized the rest of the Constitution." The Rosenberger decision, he said, was a ''tactical victory. . . . In this case, the federal government is still telling the state what it can and cannot do."
<p>
According to Mr. Sobran, "Education was compromised and corrupted once it became a state function. We should insist that religious people be given the same treatment as everyone." He concluded, "Let's have a subdued celebration in this victory and push on for a return to true federalism."
<p>
The 1995 Henry Salvatori Distinguished Lecturer, <b>M. Stanton Evans</b>, gave the closing remarks, saying that the Rosenberger victory is "one of the most important Supreme Court decisions in constitutional history." He said the decision challenged a 1947 decision by Justice Black which stated that the government may provide no support whatsoever for any religious sentiment. It is not possible, however, to "reconcile Black's decision with the activities of the Founding Fathers. Everything he says you shouldn't do, they were doing."
<p>
The purpose of the First Amendment, Mr. Evans said, "had nothing to do with Black's statement. It was intended to protect the states from intrusion by the federal government."
<p>
Young America's Foundation will continue to educate students about their religious and free speech rights on campus as a result of the Rosenberger decision.

<h3>New Foundation Staffers Fresh From Campus Battle<br></a>
Kingsley, Schenk Return To Foundation</h3>[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]</center><P>
Anxious to find an alternative to the liberal monopoly on campus, students are discovering that Young America's Foundation is the organization best able to provide that alternative through its celebrated speakers program and vast campus outreach network. In response to the increased volume of student requests for Foundation support and information, Young America's Foundation has added two new program officers to assist with campus outreach.
<p>
<b>Kristen Kingsley</b> and <b>Matthew Schenk</b>, both conservative activists, are fresh from the front-lines of the great clash of ideas taking place on the nation's campuses. Both served as interns for the Foundation during the summer of 1994, when Miss Kingsley organized the National Conservative Student Summer Conference, ant Mr. Schenk produced the Foundation's 25th Anniversary Report.
<p>
Mr. Schenk joined the Foundation's staff in June as a program officer, after graduating in May from Swarthmore College with a B.A. in English literature and political science. He served as editor-in-chief of Swarthmore's main student newspaper, The Phoenix, earning the distinction of being the first sophomore to ever hold that position. He also co-founded the Swarthmore College Republicans, and worked for <b>Rick Santorum's</b> 1994 Senate campaign.
<p>
Mr. Schenk became an ardent campus activist in the fall of 1993 when, with Young America's Foundation's assistance, he helped found the Swarthmore Conservative Union. The Foundation, recognizing Mr. Schenk's ability to contribute significantly to campus conservatism, assisted him in establishing an independent campus newspaper, Common Sense, with the goal of "providing an open and friendly forum for conservative views at Swarthmore." In his last two years at Swarthmore, Mr. Schenk and other campus activists brought nine Foundation speakers to this historically liberal college, including <b>William F. Buckley, Dinesh D'Souza, Star Parker</B>, and <b>Phyllis Schlafly</b>.
<p>
Mr. Schenk will use the experience he gained at Swarthmore to help students at other colleges get their message across. "I had so much fun creating controversy on campus during my four years at college," he admits, "I decided I wanted to make a career out of it."
<p>
The kind of "controversy" Mr. Schenk incited included a successful campaign to raise the American flag over the main building at Swarthmore, where it had been absent for the past 30 years. He also aroused the anger of the Swarthmore liberal establishment when he chartered a gun club dubbed SAFER: Swarthmore Advocates of Firearm Education and Recreation and pressured the college's budget committee into funding the group's outings. After only one year, SAFER has become the second largest recreational organization at Swarthmore.
<p>
Still, Mr. Schenk and his conservative allies at Swarthmore had an uphill battle to have their voices heard on a college that prides itself for "tolerance" and "diversity." The Swarthmore conservatives ran into many obstacles created by the liberal administration and student groups, and they achieved little success before Young America's Foundation took on their cause. "The Foundation's help really turned things around for us on campus, " Mr. Schenk said. After attending and helping to organize the Foundation's 1994 Summer I Conference as an intern, he decided that this was the kind of work to which he wanted to dedicate himself.
<p>
"There is no one on college campuses today who is as oppressed as the conservative student," Mr. Schenk points out. "And there is no group that does more to help these students than Young America's Foundation.
<p>
"We would not have had the impact we did at Swarthmore without the invaluable support of the Foundation," he adds. "Now, as a part of the Foundation's staff, I hope I can help other students make the same difference an their campuses."
<p>
Miss Kingsley's commitment to campus conservatism and her contagious enthusiasm make her a valuable addition to the staff. She believes this is a critical time for campus conservatism: "The whole country is becoming increasingly receptive to the traditional, free-market ideas that Young America's Foundation has advocated for over 25 years. Nowhere is this more true than on college campuses, where students have grown tired of the politically correct, socialist bias that their professors bring into the classroom on a daily basis."
<p>
Miss Kingsley, an Alabama native, joined the Foundation staff in June as a program officer and director of the National Conservative Student Conference. Since her arrival at the Foundation, Miss Kingsley coordinated the 17th Annual National Conservative Student Conference, held in Washington, D.C. in late July. The conference was an overwhelming success with over 400 students attending. With her outstanding interpersonal and organizational skills, Miss Kingsley will organize regional student conferences, including those to be held in Atlanta and Chicago during the school year.
<p>
For Miss Kingsley, the idea of planning such conferences is an appealing challenge: "I am anxious to work with speakers and students across the country as the Foundation continues its tradition of hosting the most effective regional student conferences in the nation." She believes that "exposing students in person to the ideas espoused by top national leaders is the most effective means of swelling the conservative ranks."
<p>
In May, 1995, Miss Kingsley graduated cum laude from Wake Forest University with a B.A. in politics and speech communication, and was inducted into honor societies in both S fields. An activist during her college years, Miss Kingsley attended the Foundation's 1993 National Summer Conference, and the spring of  1995, brought the foundation's Henry Salvatori lecturer, <b>Stan Evans</b>, to speak at Wake Forest. During the 1992 election, Miss Kingsley served <b>President Bush's</b> North Carolina advance team, and she volunteered for the campaigns of Congressman <b>Richard Burr</b> and Senator <b>Lauch Faircloth</b>.
<p>
In addition to being one of the nation's foremost campus activists and a stellar student, Miss Kingsley served as chairman of freshman orientation, a member of the student government legislature, a campus tour guide, an elementary school tutor, and even as a disc jockey on the campus radio station.
<p><p><HR><p><p><center><a name="speak"><h3>Leftists Dominate Commencement Exercises<br></a>
Shalala, Steinem, Edelman Top List of Speakers</h3>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]</center><P>
College graduation ceremonies are called "commencements" because they mark the beginning of post-college life. But in recent years college administrators are using the commencement ceremonies to send their students off with one more predictable Leftist lecture. In 1995, commencement exercises were dominated by Congressional Democrats, liberal media personalities, and Clinton Administration officials.
<p>
College administrators are reluctant to release lists of guest lecturers on their campuses because they fear criticism of their almost exclusively liberal line-up of speakers. However, commencement exercises are open to the general public and the identity of the guest speaker is obtainable. A survey of commencement addresses was conducted by Young America's Foundation of the nation's one hundred most selective colleges according to James Cass and Max Birnbaum's <i>Comparative Guide to American Colleges</I>. The results provide another insight into how our colleges offer an unbalanced view of our culture and public affairs. Instead of providing a new beginning, the commencement exercises continue the liberal bias that makes up much of a four year undergraduate education.
<p>
College administrators are enthralled with media and entertainment celebrities. National Public Radio's 
<B>Daniel Shorr</b> (Brandeis), CNN's <B>Catherine Crier</B> (Lehigh), AP's <b>Helen Thomas</b> (American), New York Times columnist <b>Russell Baker</b> (Connecticut College), CBS' <b>Dan Rather</b> (University of Texas), Washington Post columnist <b>William Raspberry</b> (University of Virginia), and ABC's <b>Ted Koppel</b> (Johns Hopkins) were among a long list of featured media personalities.
<p>
<b>Robert Redford and Quincy Jones</b> were Pomona's choices, <b>Barbra Streisand</b> joined Daniel Shorr as Honorary Degree recipients at Brandeis, and <b>Lynn Redgrave</b> was Centre College's commencement speaker.
<p>
Elected officials, at least if they are Democrats, are popular with the college administrators . President <b>Bill Clinton</b> addressed graduates at Dartmouth College. Congressman <b>George Brown</b> spoke at Claremont's Harvey Mudd, Congresswoman <b>Barbara Kennelly</b> at Trinity, Senator <b>Bill Bradley</b> at Rice, and Baltimore Mayor <b>Curt Schmoke</b> at Yale. The only Republican office holder to show up on this year's list was Congressman <b>Bob Livingston</b> at his alma mater, Tulane.
<p>
Clinton Administration officials made up the largest category of commencement speakers. Government officials were seldom invited during the Reagan-Bush years, indeed government critics dominated the list, but Clinton Administration officials are now welcomed with open arms.
<p>
Clinton's HHS Secretary <b>Donna Shalala</b> spoke at Syracuse University, Budget Director <b>Alice Rivlin</b> at the University of Iowa, Energy Czar <b>Hazel O'Leary</b> at Vassar, and Economic Advisor <b>Laura Tyson</b> at American University. Clinton's UN Ambassador <b>Madeline Albright</b> was the choice of Wellesley, Barnard, and the University of Michigan.  Defense Secretary <b>William Perry</b> spoke at Stanford University and Penn State, and NEA Chair <b>Jane Alexander</b> spoke at the University of Pennsylvania.
<p>
Other Clinton associates chosen include <b>Vernon Jordan</b> by Colgate, <b>Johnnetta Cole</b> by Oberlin, and <b>David Gergen</b> by Duke. Former Texas Governor <b>Ann Richards</b> spoke at Mount Holyoke.
<p>
Liberal activists were among those honored in this year's commencement exercises, including <b>Gloria Steinem</b> at Smith, Children's Defense Fund President <b>Marian Wright Edelman</b> at the University of Virginia and Occidental College, and Urban League official <b>Hugh Price</b> at George Washington.
<p>
Young America's Foundation's annual survey highlights an independently chosen list of highly selective colleges. The Leftist and pro-Clinton trends, however, are not exclusive to this group. The <i>New York Times</i> reported that the top four "Honored and Honored" choices found in its more comprehensive survey were: <B>Marian Wright Edelman</b> (seven honorary degrees or Commencement lectures), <b>Henry Louis Gates, Jr.</b> (six), <b>Bill Cosby</b> (six), and Donna Shalala (four). Commencement speakers at less selective schools also emphasized anti-Republican and pro-big government themes.
<p>
And a year-by-year comparison reinforces the bias. For example, the honored guests invited to George Washington University during the past three years included Donna Shalala ('93), <b>Hillary Clinton</b> ('94) and <b>Tom Foley</b> ('95) Yale honored <b>Jodie Foster</b> in 1993, <b>Sargent Shriver</b> in 1994 and Democrat Mayor Curt Schmoke in 1995. The University of Pennsylvania hosted Hillary Clinton (93), <b>Henry Cisneros</b> ('94), and Jane Alexander ('95).  Stanford's 1993 speaker was <b>Diane Feinstein</b>, 1994 speaker was <b>Stephen Carter</b>, and this year it was William Perry. Dartmouth chose <b>Bill Moyers</b> in 1993, Robert Reich in 1994.  Reich's boss Bill Clinton in 1995. Duke's last three speakers were Bill Bradley, Judy Woodruff, and David Gergen. Wellesley sticks with Liberal women: Gloria Steinem, <b>Cokie Roberts</b>, and Madeline Albright.
<p>
In a by-gone era college administrators were reluctant to have Leftists and Democrat politicians dominate their commencement exercises because parents, trustees, and donors were on hand. But in recent years those inhibitions vanished on most campuses. Clinton Administration officials, Liberal commentators, and elected Democrat officials are regularly given the honor of addressing the graduating seniors and their families.
<p>
This imbalance appears especially acute in a year when college students demonstrated their strong preference for conservative speakers when they were available. <b>Bill Bennett, William F. Buckley, Jr., P.J. O'Rourke, Oliver North, Margaret Thatcher</b>, and <b>General Colin Powell</b> drew standing room only crowds on many campuses during the school year. In nearly every case they spoke before much larger audiences than their liberal counter parts. In addition, in a year when revolutionary changes came to Capitol Hill, the major campuses' graduates didn't hear from a single member of the new Republican leadership.
<p>
Some Republicans and a couple of conservatives were among the speakers at the major campuses. Yet they are invariably former officials who are unlikely to champion a conservative position on today's cutting-edge issues in a manner comparable to that of the Democratic office-holders who are actively defending the Clinton Administration positions. President <b>George Bush</b> delivered the commencement address at William and Mary, <b>Marilyn Quayle</b> spoke at Rose Hulman Institute of Technology in Indiana, and Stanford Administrator <b>Condoleezza Rice</b> was honored at Notre Dame.
<p>
Harvard's Commencement speaker was Czech Republic President <b>Vaclav Havel</b>.
<p>
No conservative movement organization leader, free market academic, Reagan appointed jurist, or conservative religious leader, addressed any of the top schools' commencements. Outstanding speakers such as Nobel Laureate <b>Milton Friedman</b>, Stanford scholar <b>Thomas Sowell</b>, author Clancy, Rev. <b>Billy Graham</b>, Cardinal <B>John O'Connor</b>, General <B>Norman Schwarzkopf</b>, media commentators <b>George Will</b> and <B>Rush Limbaugh</b>, and House leaders <B>Newt Gingrich</b> and <B>Dick Armey</b>, were passed over for the likes of Gloria Steinem, Lynn Redgrave, Daniel Shorr, and back bench Democrat Congressmen!
<p>
Commencements this year looked more like one last dose of left-wing indoctrination than a fresh start for the graduates of the Class of '95.

<H3>North to Deliver Keynote Address at Richmond Conference on November 15-16</H3>
Foundation regional conferences have established a nationwide reputation for being the most effective training grounds for America's conservative student leaders. 
 Thousands of students have participated in these informative weekend conferences, and have been spurred on to greater activism as a result.  
<table align=left width="200" hspace="5">

<P>The next Foundation regional conference will be 
held on <B>November 15-16 </B>at the Omni Hotel in Richmond, 
Virginia.  <B>Oliver North </B>will be the keynote speaker on Friday 
evening, November 15, and <B>M. Stanton Evans</B>, author of 
<I>The Theme is Freedom</I>, will be among those 
addressing the conference on Saturday, November 16.  (Additional speakers will be confirmed as the date draws nearer.)
<P>If you are a full-time college student, this 
conference is <B>FREE</B> of charge, but advance 
registration is mandatory.
<P>
<BR>The two-day conference is the perfect way to sharpen your 
campus activism skills in order to become a more effective advocate 
of your beliefs.  Whether you are an experienced activist or are 
just becoming involved, we welcome your participation.  So, tell your friends and conservative 
club members to put Nov. 15-16 on their calendars today.
<P>The Richmond conference will allow you to bring some balance 
to your one-sided liberal education by exposing you to the 
principles of free market economics, the virtues of traditional American 
values, and the brilliance of our Founding Fathers.  Attending 
this conference is the best way to motivate yourself to change your 
campus.  As Oliver North said, &quot;We weren't put here to simply 
endure the future... we are here to change it for the good.&quot;
<P>To register for the Richmond Conference, call 
<B>Kristen Kingsley</B> today at 1-800-292-9231.

Young America's Foundation is pleased to announce a new lecture series for the 1996-97 academic year.
<table align=right width="320" hspace="5">
<tr><td><B><I>M. Stanton Evans</B>, author of </I>The Theme is

Have you ever been in a 
     class and had your professor or a classmate go on and on expounding some 
liberal position?  Perhaps you wanted to challenge their arguments but 
were reluctant because you didn't have all the facts on hand.  
Young America's Foundation would like to help.
<P>The Foundation understands that conservative ideas are 
rarely mentioned in the classroom unless they are being distorted by a 
professor.  It is easy for students to come across the liberal 
arguments in their classes, in casual discussions, or in the campus paper.  
In order to learn about conservative ideas, however, students need 
to go out of the way, taking the initiative and doing their own research.  
<P>The Foundation recognizes that getting a balanced 
education <I>shouldn't </I>be such a time consuming project.  To help students 
learn about the <I>other </I>side of the argument, Young America's 
Foundation is continuing its series of &quot;issue briefs&quot; on the most 
controversial and hotly debated issues on campus.  
<P>The latest two issue briefs provide valuable information on 
the issues of Social Security privatization and reform of 
the student financial aid system.  These are two issues that should be 
of optimum concern to college-aged students.  With the 
information provided by these two briefs, you will be able to challenge 
liberal professors, misguided classmates, and slanted editorials.
<P>In addition to the &quot;Social Security&quot; and &quot;Financial Aid&quot; 
issue papers, the Foundation is still offering its brief covering 
&quot;Affirmative Action on Campus.&quot;  If you would like to receive copies of 
 these informative papers, please contact <B>Matthew Schenk 
</B>at Young America's Foundation at 1-800-292-9231.

<H3>Senator Wallop Joins Speaker Program</H3><BR>
Former United States Senator 
    <B>Malcolm Wallop </B>is now 
     available to defend freedom and liberty on your campus 
through the Foundation's speaker program. As a three-term Senator from 
Wyoming, Malcolm Wallop was a leader on various issues such 
asthe flat tax, federal deregulation, private property rights, and a 
strong national defense.

<I>Former Wyoming Senator <B>Malcolm Wallop </B>has been a longtime defender 
of private property rights.</I><BR>
</td></tr>
</table> 
<P>Having served on numerous congressional committees, 
Senator Wallop is an expert on many issues. He was the first to 
propose a space-based defense system in 1976. His efforts in 1981 led 
to cuts in inheritance and gift taxes. He is also knowledgeable on 
environmental issues. His latest effort has been to lead the fight 
against the Clinton Administration's &quot;War on the West.&quot;  Senator Wallop 
was successful in stopping the government's assault on 
Western mining, grazing, and water rights, seeing the government's efforts 
as an attempt to limit the rights of individuals and the states. 
<P>
Senator Wallop has written for a number of distinguished 
publications, such as <I>National Review, </I>the<I> Economist, U.S. News 
and World Report,</I> the <I>American 
Spectator</I>, the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>,  
and the <I>New York Times</I>. The Senator has appeared on many 
television programs such as <I>Nightline, </I>the 
<I>Today Show, CBS Morning News</I>, and the <I>McNeil-Lehrer News Hour.</I>
<P>Currently, he is Chairman of Frontiers of Freedom, a 
non-profit organization dedicated to the promotion of personal freedom 
and the reduction of federal fiscal and regulatory powers. He 
recently advocated reforming the Endangered Species Act and 
privatizing Social Security.  Senator Wallop continues to be a Wyoming 
rancher and businessman.

Mr. Eastland offers a 
compelling criticism of race-based quotas and rigged admissions 
policies.  He argues that the true test of a democracy is its adherence 
to colorblindness. 
<P>Mr. Eastland is editor of <I>Forbes 
MediaCritic</I> and a fellow at the <BR>
Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, D.C.  He is a 
leading authority on Supreme Court decisions concerning not only race 
but also religious freedom.  His research and experience give him 
a unique perspective on the impact of affirmative action.  
<P>The Grover Hermann Freedom Lecture Series was named 
in memory of the entrepreneur, <B>Grover 
Hermann</B>.  As founder of American Asphalt Company 
and chairman of the board of Martin Marietta Corporation until 
his death in 1979, Mr. Hermann was remembered as a man who 
generously contributed both his time and fortune to many 
philanthropies.

<H3>Are There &quot;Screwballs, Devil Dames, and 
Closet Cases&quot; in Your College's Curriculum?</H3>
Young America's Founda
          tion has just completed the 
          second edition of <I>Comedy and Tragedy:  College Course 
Descriptions and What They Tell Us About Higher Education 
Today</I>.
<P>This edition examines courses from fifty national 
universities and liberal arts colleges and concludes that bizarre 
and trendy courses have infiltrated every facet of higher 
education.
<P>To many, courses such as Harvard's &quot;A Thousand 
Feminisms,&quot; De Paul's &quot;Sociology of Rock Music,&quot; 
and Amherst's &quot;Black English&quot; are 
merely amusing, but college students understand that the 
product of this kind of frivolous, &quot;multicultural&quot; curriculum is 
an inferior education and poor preparation for the job market.
<P>Parents, taxpayers, concerned educators, and prospective employers should also be troubled 
by this tragedy in American higher education.  Due to this 
obsession with multiculturalism and &quot;victim studies,&quot; an entire generation 
of students is being ill-prepared for life in the real world.
<P><I>Comedy and Tragedy </I>reveals that courses such as 
&quot;Sorcery and Magic,&quot; and &quot;Sex and Gender on Film: 
Screwballs, Devil Dames, and Closet Cases,&quot; are just the tip of 
the iceberg.  
<P>
<BR>

college curriculum, contact <B>Dede Hamilton </B>at 1-800-292-9231. <HR>

Most American college campuses are in desperate need of reform.  At a time when      the American people are rejecting big government and the whole world is rejecting socialism, most campus economics and political science departments still cling to the failed policies of  Marxism.  Speech codes, designed to silence politically incorrect views, are in effect at hundreds of colleges and universities.  Campus curricula is overwhelmingly slanted to the left in virtually every subject, as victim-studies courses have crowded out more traditional offerings in many fields.  Faculty and administrators almost exclusively reserve guest lecture invitations to radical Leftists.  If students wish to bring conservative or free market speakers to their campuses, they must do so on their own.
<P>There is much at stake here.  If Leftist ideas are allowed to go unchallenged on campus, then they alone will influence and educate our nation's future leaders.  Your professors and administrators--the radicals and rabble-rousers of the 1960s--are not likely to promote traditional and free market ideas.  It is the students who are the greatest hope for reforming this imbalance.
<P>If you are a student on today's campus, you are at the very point of conflict in a cultural and intellectual war to determine the future of American society.  You, your children, and your grandchildren will live in a country substantially impacted by the outcome of that struggle.
<P>Young America's Foundation is here to help you in this struggle.  We provide the resources that can help you balance the campus debate.  In addition to our extensive campus lecture program, we also can provide you with advice on how to become a more effective campus reformer.  An informative guide, entitled <B><I>A Student Strategy for Campus Reform</B></I>, has recently been published by Young America's Foundation.  In this guide, you will find advice on how to form a campus organization, obtain funding for speakers and activities, inform sympathetic alumni of your efforts, and get coverage from campus and local media.
<P>In reforming your campus, you are not only doing a great service for your fellow students and your country, but you are also developing skills and connections that will benefit you for years to come.  You could have the opportunity to meet public figures and personalities such as <B>William F.

<center><a name="medved"><h3>Film Critic Michael Medved<BR> Selected as 1995-96<BR>
Grover Hermann Freedom Lecturer</h3>[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]</center><P>
Film critic <b>Michael Medved</b> will be featured as this year's <B>Grover Hermann Freedom Lecturer</b>. As the co-host of Sneak Previews and the chief film critic for The New York Post, Mr. Medved is an authority in the debate over cultural values and the role that Hollywood plays in influencing them. Most recently, he has appeared as a guest host on the Rush Limbaugh Radio Show.
<p>
As a best-selling author and nationally recognized television personality, Mr. Medved has been featured in numerous televised debates concerning the negative impact of the entertainment industry. His most indelible contribution to this subject, however, is his book Hollywood vs. America. Speaking at the Foundation' s 1995 Summer Conference, Mr. Medved noted that Senator Robert Dole, in making his highly publicized speech denouncing the film, television, and music industries, drew much of his theme from <B><I>Hollywood vs. America</B></I>. "Senator Dole had a copy of my book on the podium, somewhat visible," Mr. Medved noted, "and I do know that he quoted four sentences from my book more or less verbatim. . . and he even acknowledged one of them. . . which I was very pleased to see."
<p>
Michael Medved is also the author of several other books, including <b><I>The Shadow Presidents, Hospital: The Hidden Lives of a Medical Center Staff</B></I?, and <B><I>What Really Happened to the Class of '65?</b></I>, which served as the basis for an NBC television series. He is also a member of the Writer' s Guild of America and has worked as a screenwriter on several major studio film projects.
<p>
The Grover Hermann Freedom Lecture Series was named in memory of philanthropist and entrepreneur, Grover Hermann. Mr. Hermann's career has been described as an "old-fashioned, free enterprise success story." In 1913, at age 23, he used a $5,000 investment to start the American Asphalt Company, which he expanded over the years into a large, diversified nationwide corporation.
<p>
Mr. Hermann's business, renamed American Marietta Company in the early 1930's, ultimately merged with the Martin Company in 1961 to form Martin Marietta Corporation for which he served as chairman of the board. At the time of his death in 1979, Mr. Hermann was remembered not only as a great entrepreneur and businessman, but also as a man who generously contributed both time and fortune to many philanthropies.
<p>
To find out how you may submit a proposal to bring Mr. Medved to speak at your campus, please call <b>Michelle Sharp</b> at 1-800-292-9231.


<p><p><hr><center><a name="document"><h3>Document Leftist Bias on Your Campus!</h3></a>[ <a href="#contents">Contents </a>]</center>
<p>
When was the last time you heard a conservative lecturer speak on your campus? If you can't remember, chances are your college is like most others, in that an endless stream of liberals are paraded onto campus, all warmly embraced by college faculty and administrators, while no effort is made to bring in traditional or free market ideas.
<p>
What can you do to turn this tide and hold your college accountable for providing educational balance? One way is to document just how one-sided the campus debate is by researching the speakers your college has sponsored recently.
<p>
Students at Swarthmore College combed through the archives of the campus newspaper, and discovered that in the past four years not one conservative had been featured as a guest lecturer. During that same period, dozens of radical liberals were sponsored by the college, including a former leader of the Black Panthers, politicians such as Lenora Fulani and Michael Dukakis, and no less than 15 "experts" on multiculturalism and homosexual issues. With this information, these students were able to convince the college to help bring in Young America's Foundation speakers <b>William Buckley, Star Parker, Michael Medved, Walter Williams, </b>and<b> Dinesh D'Souza</b>.
<p>
Students at Appalachian State University went even farther, going back eight years and totaling exactly how much money was spent to bring in speakers such as Abbie Hoffman, Molly Yard, Maya Angelou, and Ralph Nader. After they were finished with their research, the front-page headline in the next issue of their student paper read: "Liberal Speakers - $242,000; Conservative Speakers - $0."
<p>
Ask your campus' speaker selection committee for a list of past guest lecturers, or look back through past issues of the school newspaper to find out who your campus has been sponsoring. Once you have your results, publicize them by notifying local newspapers and radio talk shows. Send a letter to sympathetic alumni, letting them know what speakers your college has been endorsing.
<p>
The next step is to use the information as a leveraging point to get the college administration and speakers committee to help you bring in alternative speakers. Every college that has done this kind of research in the past has achieved great success in sponsoring conservative lecturers.
<p>
After you have documented the bias and made the case for balancing your college's lecture program, contact Young America's Foundation and we can help you sponsor a speaker on your campus.

<p>

What College Course Descriptions Tell Us<br>
About Higher Education</h3></a>[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]</center><p>
<b>Comedy and Tragedy: College Course Descriptions and What They Tell Us About Higher Education Today</b> is a survey published by Young America's Foundation documenting the decay of academic standards in the classes offered at our nation's top colleges and universities. Young America's Foundation found that a disturbingly high number of classes propagate ideology (including feminism, anti-Americanism, and Marxism), and not education.
<p>
Such classes as Yale's "Drag Queens, Transsexuals, and Queers:  Anthropological Approaches," Harvard's "Perceptions of the Supernatural: Witches, Werewolves, and Ouija Boards," and Columbia's "Race, Gender, and the Politics of Rock 'n' Roll" are among the hundreds of bizarre courses listed.
<p>
While <i>Comedy and Tragedy</I> is not for sale, students can obtain copies of the report by sending Young America's Foundation at least five politically correct courses offered by your school. Though not every school offers titles as bizarre as the University of Michigan's "Lesbian Literature" or SUNY-Albany's "Society's Nightmare: Images of Gender, Race, and Class in Horror Film," we are confident that you can add to the list of questionable courses.
<p>
If you wish to receive <i>Comedy and Tragedy</I>, send the aforementioned information to <b>Dan Flynn</b> at Young America's Foundation, 110 Elden Street, Herndon, VA 22070. Make sure to note the department in which the courses you list are offered and the full description that appears in your school's course catalogue.

<p>
Young America's Foundation is pleased to announce that <B>Walter Williams</b> is the <b>1995-96 Henry Salvatori Lecturer</b>. Dr. Williams, the John M. Olin Distinguished Professor of Economics at George Mason University, is a nationally syndicated columnist and appears regularly as a guest host on the <I>Rush Limbaugh Radio Show</i>.

<p>
Dr. Williams is the author of several books, including <I><B>The State Against Blacks, America: A Minority Viewpoint</B></I>, and <i><b>All It Takes Is Guts</b></i>.
<p>
<B>Henry Salvatori</B> is the founder of Western Geophysical Company, one of the largest oil-exploration contracting organizations with worldwide operations. He founded Western Geophysical in 1933 and, after a merger with Litton Industries in 1960, he continued as Western' s chief executive officer and director of Litton Industries until his retirement in 1967. Mr. Salvatori is a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, and received his masters degree in physics from Columbia University.

It is time to begin planning which speakers you will bring to your campus this fall. Young America's Foundation's 1995-96 speakers program booklet features not only prominent leaders of the conservative movement who are available to speak on your campus, but also includes crucial information on how to host a successful event.<P>

Last year the Foundation sponsored speakers such as <b>Margaret Thatcher, Walter Williams</b>, and <b>Dan Quayle</b> on campuses across the country. New additions to the speakers booklet this year include <b>G. Gordon Liddy, Ralph Reed, P.J. O'Rourke, Marilyn Quayle</b>, and <i>USA Today's</i> <b>Tony Snow</b>.

<p><p><hr><center><a name="gov"><h3>Is the Government Crushing Your Job Prospects?</h3></a>[ <a href="#contents">Contents </a>]</center>
<p>
Concerned about finding a job when you graduate? It's tough out there for a couple of reasons, and they might surprise you. Big government and political correctness are a graduate's main adversaries. Over-regulation of every type of industry combined with the diminishing regard corporate leaders have for today's college degrees are dramatically impacting recent college graduates' ability to find employment.
<P>Through the Foundation program, <i>Job Prospects for College Graduates: What's the Problem?</i>, free market economists and corporate leaders will speak to students on these critical issues, giving students the insights they need for maximizing their educational opportunities and avoiding the pitfalls of a useless degree. <p>
Students who participate in our program will gain a unique understanding of the job market and of the qualities employers are seeking in new recruits.
<P>Young America's 
Foundation will work with you in developing a program which will meet the needs of your campus. We will provide literature, including <b><i>Job Prospects for College Graduates: The Role of Government</i></b> and <b><i>The Responsibilities of the University</i></b>, a monograph written by economics professor <b>Thomas J. DiLorenzo</b> and published by Young America's Foundation. We will also assist you in bringing a corporate leader and free market scholar to your school. If you are interested in participating in this Foundation program, please call <b>Kate Griffin</b> at 1-800-292-9231.

Young America's Foundation is pleased to announce <b>Robert Novak</b> as the featured speaker for the <b>1995 William H. Flowers Lecture Series</b>.<P>
<b>William Flowers</b> is the former chairman of Flowers Industries, a Fortune 500 company with distribution throughout the United States.

Just like Jason from "Friday the 
13th" or "A Nightmare on Elm Street's" Freddy Kreuger, the <b>National Standards for History</b> is a monstrosity that refuses to die.
<P>A product of the Goals 2000 
project, strongly endorsed by President Clinton, the Standard s met with widespread criticism when they were first released last year. Blasted for their politically correct revisionism and strong anti-Western bias, it appeared that the Standards had been completely defeated, especially after the U.S. Senate voted 99-1 to condemn them.<P>
In February, however, the National Center for History in the Schools, the group based out of UCLA that created the Standards, redoubled its efforts to inject the flawed curriculum into grade schools and high schools across the country. The Center produced a slick brochure showcasing the National Standards, attempting to market them directly to school districts. The debate is clearly far from being over.<P>
In response to this attempt, Continuity, the history journal published by Young America's Foundation, asked eleven of the country's most respected history scholars to assess the Standards based on their historical merit.<P>
The result is the most in-depth, fact-based criticism of the Standards to date. This special issue of <I>Continuity</i> will give you all the ammunition you need to discuss or debate the National Standards with your professors or classmates.<P>

<p><p><hr><center><a name="last word"><h3>Don't Let the Liberals Have the Last Word!</h3></a>[ <a href="#contents">Contents </a>]</center>
<p>Have you ever been in a class and had your professor or a classmate go on and on expounding some liberal position? Perhaps you wanted to challenge their arguments but were reluctant because you didn't have all the facts on hand. Young America's Foundation would like to help.
<P>We understand that 
conservatives are overwhelmingly outnumbered on campuses, and that conservative ideas are rarely mentioned in the classroom unless they are being distorted by a professor. It is easy for students to come across the liberal arguments in their classes, in casual discussions, or in the campus paper. In order to learn about conservative ideas, however, students need to go out of their way, doing their own research and taking the initiative. Achieving philosophical balance in higher education can be a very time consuming project.
<P>To help students learn about the other side of the argument, Young America's Foundation is compiling and will distribute "issue briefs" on the most controversial and hotly debated issues on campus. The Foundation's issue briefs will assist you in learning the conservative side of the argument. With the information provided by them, you will be able to challenge liberal professors, misguided classmates, and slanted editorials.<P>
The first issue brief will deal with the liberal policy of affirmative action and will be available within the first weeks of the school year. If you would like to be put on the mailing list to receive these briefs, or if you would like to suggest a topic for a future issue brief, please contact <B>Matthew Schenk</b> at Young America's Foundation at 1-800-292-9231.

Young America's Foundation is 
proud to announce its newest lecture program: the <b>William Casey Lecture Series</b>. Named in honor of the late <b>William Casey</b>, who served under Ronald Reagan as the director of the C.I.A. from 1981-86, the Casey Lecture Series will feature author <b>Peter Schweizer</b> as its inaugural speaker.
<P>Mr. Schweizer is the author of several books, including Friendly Spies, and Victory: The Reagan Administration's Secret Strategy that Hastened the Collapse of the Soviet Union. In Victory, Mr. Schweizer uncovered previously unpublished information revealing that the United States' victory in the Cold War was a direct result of actions taken by the Reagan Administration. The main architect of this strategy, Schweizer's research revealed, was C.I.A. Director Casey. Mr. Schweizer has been active with Young America' s Foundation since a student in high school, and served as its academic director from 1991 to 1994.
<P>A true American hero, William Casey not only headed the C.I.A. and directly helped to bring about the collapse of communism, but he also served as the manager of Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign.

<b>Newt Gingrich, Jack Kemp, Robert Novak, Fred Barnes, Walter Williams, Dinesh D'Souza, Ralph Reed, Michael Medved, Trent Lott, Sonny Bono</b>, and <b>Oliver North</b> have a lot in common. Not just their conservative ideals. Not simply the fact that they are top national leaders. These individuals, among others, recently addressed the 17th annual National Conservative Student Conference.
<P>Four hundred activists from campuses nationwide convened from July 23 to 29 in Washington D C. for the most comprehensive conservative conference available to students.

</center>
<p>
Young America's Foundation is pleased to announce that G. Gordon Liddy, P.J. O'Rourke, Tony Snow, 
and Marilyn Tucker Quayle have joined its speakers program.<p>

<b>G. Gordon Liddy</b> is the host of the hottest talk show in national syndication. He has firmly established himself as one of the most intelligent and engaging voices in the country. His triumphant return to the nation's capital also illustrates the significance of his central message: the importance of striving to prevail where others simply survive, whatever your field of endeavor.<p>

<b>P.J. O'Rourke</b> is called "the funniest writer in America" by the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. At the lecture podium he never fails to inform and entertain, whether he is dealing with the state of the nation, the issues that shape our contemporary world, or the hilariously serious people who 
pontificate about them.<p>

<b>Marilyn Quayle</b>, wife of former Vice President Dan Quayle, is a partner in an Indianapolis law firm where she practices general corporate law, specializing in mergers and acquisitions, international, and health care law. During her husband's tenure as vice president, Mrs. Quayle served on the board of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. She was also chairman of the International Disaster Advisory Committee for the Agency for International Development. She continues to work with the National Cancer Institute as the national spokesman for NCI's Breast Cancer Summits.<p>

<b>Tony Snow</b> is a nationally syndicated columnist for the Detroit News and counterpoint columnist for <i>USA Today</i>. His editorials appear in various mediums around the world. He works as a commentator on National Public Radio and as a permanent guest-host on Rush Limbaugh's radio program. He is also a regular contributor to such television shows as <i>The McLaughlin Group, The McNeil-Lehrer News Hour, Good Morning America, Face the Nation</i>, and <i>Crossfire</i>.<p>

If you are interested in hosting one of these speakers, or any of our other speakers, please contact <b>Michelle Sharp</b> at 1-800-292-9231.

</center>
<p>
Fresh from Oliver North's exhilarating senatorial campaign where he served as director of the Virginia Finance Committee, <b>Marc Short</b> returns to Young America's Foundation as national director. Marc originally joined the Foundation as national director after graduating from Washington and Lee University in 1992. He will oversee the Foundation's 17th annual summer conference and explore new opportunities organizing regional conferences.<p>

<b>Kate Obenshain Griffln</b> concluded her tenure as Governor George Allen's special assistant for policy development and returned to the Foundation as director of program development. In 1991, after graduating from the University of Virginia, Kate became the Foundation's lecture director. She left the Foundation in the summer of 1993 to join Allen's gubernatorial campaign. After the election, she went to work for Governor Allen, focusing on education and health policy.<p>

In the midst of his high-profile Supreme Court case against the University of Virginia, <b>Ron Rosenberger</b> joins the Foundation as a program officer. Ron served as an intern at the Foundation while a student at the University of Virginia. As a campus activist at UVa, Ron founded a publication which was denied student activities funds on the basis of it being a "religious activity."  Ron filed suit against UVa and his case is currently before the Supreme Court. Ron was active with Young America's Foundation while at UVa, bringing prominent conservative speakers such as Edwin Meese and Dinesh D'Souza to campus.

</center>
<p>
Foundation Program Officer <b>Ron Rosenberger's</b> run-in with University of Virginia officials is a prime example of a disturbing trend: an alarming increase of flagrant discrimination against religious students and faculty members on campuses. In Ron's case, UVa denied his magazine, Wide Awake, funding, asserting that it was a religious activity advocating an "avowedly Christian" perspective. However, UVa had already funded the Muslim Students Association and Jewish Law Students Association. Young America's Foundation is currently conducting research on such discrimination. If you have experienced discrimination or intimidation first-hand, or are aware of examples on your campus, please call Ron Rosenberger at the Foundation: 1-800-292-9231.

The Family Research Council works daily with the media to ensure that the 
<B>Pro-Family Voice</B> is heard.
<P>
The Family Research Council is active in taking its message to the gatekeepers 
of the public airways and print publications, presenting critical information 
necessary for a balanced approach to the story of the American family. Often, 
FRC is the only pro-family voice heard by opinion shapers controlling radio, 
television and print.  Daily, the national media - from CNN on television to 
print leaders like the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> - contact FRC's network of 
experts.

The Family Research Council is a nonprofit, nonpartisan educational 
organization operating under the provision of Section 501C-3 of the 
Internal Revenue Code.  It was originally founded in 1983, merged 
with Focus on the Family from 1988-1992, then reorganized as a separate 
501C-3 and incorporated as such in the District of Columbia in October 
1992.  The Council is supported by voluntary donations and grants.  The 
bulk of its contributions are received from individuals.  Donations to 
FRC are tax-deductible.
<P>
The Family Research Council exists to reaffirm and promote nationally, 
and particularly in Washington, DC,  the traditional family unit and 
the Judeo-Christian value system upon which it is built.
<P>
To accomplish this task, the Council will:
<P>

<UL>
<li>Promote and defend traditional family values in print, broadcast and 
other media outlets.
<li>Develop and advocate legislative and public policy initiatives 
which strengthen and fortify the family and promote traditional values.
<li>Establish and maintain an accurate source of statistical and 
research information which reaffirms the importance of the family in our 
civilization.
<li>Inform and educate citizens on how they can promote Biblical 
principles in our culture.
</UL>

<P>

In Washington, D.C., a city often estranged from heart and home, the 
Family Research Council is an unparalleled organization which focuses 
its efforts solely on defending the interests of the American Family. 
FRC provides an alternative voice in the media -- a voice for the family 
and family values.  A unique and multi-faceted team has united to meet 
these challenges.

<p>

For more details about FRC's stance on issues that affect the family, 
make sure to read our <a href="/townhall/FRC/faq/">FAQ (Frequently 
Asked Questions) List</a>.

In this 90-second daily (Monday through Friday) radio commentary, former 
White House Domestic Policy Adviser Gary Bauer offers his insights on 
breaking (or about to break) news stories on family issues in the nation's 
capital.  This up-to-the-minute broadcast is a unique "window" on 
developments in the national public policy debate.  Bauer keeps a close 
eye on the White House, the Supreme Court, and the major media.  He takes 
the pulse of official Washington and reports stories you may not hear 
anywhere else, from the latest bureaucratic outrage to the sometimes 
startling data many pundits would rather you<I> not know</I>. Gary Bauer's 
daily commentary champions <B>truth in governing.</B>

<title>ACU - Press Release - Re-Elect Gingrich - Jan. 3, 1997</title>
</head>
<body>
<center>
<h3>Statement by David A. Keene</h3></center>

<P>
<blockquote>
For more than three decades now, the American Conservative Union has held high the banner of the conservative political philosophy -- a philosophy that stresses individual freedom, free market economics, traditional moral values, and a strong national defense.
<P>
For the vast majority of those three decades plus, we have struggled in a topsy-turvy environment, an environment where we knew for a fact -- intuitively, through survey research, and from voting behavior -- that though our principles commanded the allegiance of a majority of American citizens, our allies held only a minority in the People's House.
<P>
Two years ago, that topsy-turvy situation righted itself, when a majority of American voters, facing a clear ideological decision, voted in a Republican House of Representatives.  We'd like to think that our efforts over the years to educate our citizenry had something to do with that great conservative victory.
<P>
What is indisputable is that that victory was due primarily to the determined efforts of a group of our allies in the Republican House leadership who conceived and implemented a plan to produce a conservative majority in the House.
<P>
And the man who bears the greatest responsibility for having the vision and the determination to achieve that victory is the Speaker of the House, the Honorable Newt Gingrich.
<P>
Consequently, though we have had our disagreements -- some public, most private -- with the Speaker over the course of the last two years, we nevertheless count ourselves among his allies.
<P>
And when our political adversaries, led by hypocrites like Richard Gephardt and David Bonior, attack our friends over trumped-up charges, we know what we must do.
<P>
So today I am announcing an unprecedented action for the American Conservative Union: the Directors of our Board, who number among them many of the longest-serving, most able, and most dedicated leaders of the conservative movement, have approved a resolution offering our support for the re-election of Newt Gingrich as Speaker of the House of Representatives.
<P>
We take this action not merely because we consider the Speaker an ally, but because we fear the consequences of a vote to deny him the Speakership.
<P>
To fail to re-elect Mr. Gingrich to the Speakership would be to cede control of the House of Representatives to the liberals who oppose him.  Democrats seem unable to realize the indisputable fact that they are in the minority; they seem to believe they still run the House.
<P>
And too many Republicans seem to agree with them.
<P>
Normally, the American Conservative Union doesn't involve itself in matters such as this.  Whom the House chooses to lead its deliberations is an issue full of partisan overtones, and we have prided ourselves for more than three decades on our non-partisanship.

<P>
But over the course of the last few weeks, it has become clear that this is no longer a partisan fight; it is an ideological fight.
<P>
The Boniors and Gephardts of the world oppose Newt Gingrich as Speaker not merely because he is a Republican, and not merely because he brought down Jim Wright, and not merely because he engineered a historic victory two years ago; they oppose him because under his leadership, the Republican Party has revitalized itself, forced the national debate onto conservative terms, and won the hearts and minds of a majority of voters.
<P>
Under Newt Gingrich's leadership, the 104th Congress passed the first balanced budget in a generation, balancing spending cuts with tax cuts.
<P>
Under Newt Gingrich's leadership, the 104th Congress passed the most far-reaching reform of a federal entitlement program in history, ending the federal entitlement to welfare.
<P>
Under Newt Gingrich's leadership, the 104th Congress considered and passed a virtual cornucopia of conservative legislation.
<P>
And under his leadership, the new, 105th Congress will continue to address the nation's problems from a conservative point of view.
<P>
That is why the liberals oppose him, and that is why this is no longer simply a partisan battle.  It has taken on significance for those of us who do battle in the ideological trenches.  And that is why we have taken the action we have.
<P>
Moreover, something else troubles us greatly -- the callous hypocrisy practiced by the Democratic leaders who call for Mr. Gingrich's resignation as Speaker.
<P>
Their own choice for Speaker, Mr. Gephardt of Missouri, has his own troubled ethical past.  The very same Ethics Committee that dismissed all but one of the 70-plus charges against Mr. Gingrich rebuked Mr. Gephardt last year for submitting "erroneous" information about a beach front property he owned -- either as an investment property (if you read his tax returns and bank loan documentation), or as a personal residence (if you read his submissions to the Ethics Committee).
<P>
And even more troubling is the fact that the very men who now scream the loudest for Mr. Gingrich's head are the leaders of a party whose own illegal and unethical campaign finance schemes bring new headlines every day.  Literally millions of dollars were raised for the Democratic Party by renting out the Lincoln Bedroom, laundering money from people who didn't have the resources to donate their own funds, and gathering contributions from foreign corporations and individuals whose gifts are illegal under current campaign finance legislation.
<P>
And this is the party whose leaders now cry out for campaign finance reform.
It is as if Captain Renault, upon learning gambling was taking place as Rick's Cafe, insisted that not only was he shocked -- shocked! -- to learn of it, but that he demanded its immediate termination, and promised to introduce legislation to that effect.
<P>
The hypocrisy is simply mind-boggling.
<P>
This afternoon we are sending a letter to every conservative Member of Congress, outlining what we believe to be the stakes in the vote tomorrow, and urging a vote for Mr. Gingrich as Speaker.  
<P>
As I said earlier, we do this not because we are Republicans, but because we are conservatives, and we believe the fate of the conservative revolution hangs in the balance.
<P>
I'll now read for you the full text of the <a href="/conservative/res010697.html">resolution</a>  approved by the Board of Directors of the American Conservative Union, and then I'll be happy to answer any questions you might have.
<P>

<title> The Rule of Law in Hong Kong In the Run-Up to 1997 - Heritage</title>

<b>Heritage Lecture No. 561</b>
<h2>The Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.html">Lectures and Educational Programs</a></h2><hr> 
<h3>The Rule of Law In Hong Kong In the Run-Up to 1997 and Beyond</h3>

By Daniel R. Fung, Q.C., J.P.<br>
January 30, 1996
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is a rare privilege and a real pleasure for me personally to be asked to address you today. I am honored to see before me a galaxy of experts not just on Hong Kong and China issues specifically, but also on East Asian affairs in general. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
May I begin by briefly outlining the duties and powers of my present office. Next I shall proceed to canvass what we as a government have done to entrench the rule of law in Hong Kong, after which I will talk about the inculcation in our community of legal culture and human rights values. Finally, I will address the question foremost on everyone's minds and offer a prognosis as to whether the foregoing legal and cultural construct will survive the transition to Chinese sovereignty. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The office of Solicitor General for Hong Kong differs substantially from that of my counterpart in the United States federal government. While your Solicitor General acts as the government's principal advocate responsible for determining which issues warrant determination in the United States Supreme Court and the federal Appeals Courts, my portfolio covers the Hong Kong government's legal policy. In the context of the run-up to 1997 and beyond, my brief is to ensure that Hong Kong's legal system remains true to the spirit of the common law before as well as after the reversion to Chinese sovereignty. I carry also a number of sub-portfolios, including the legal protection of human rights, constitutional and electoral law, the law of the People's Republic of China (in terms of advising my government on PRC law as well as monitoring its growth and development), and, finally, law reform in Hong Kong.
<p>
<b>HONG KONG'S COMMON LAW HERITAGE</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The common law is arguably Britain's greatest and proudest legacy bequeathed to Hong Kong. We are poised to emerge from just over a century-and-a-half of British rule. As a direct result, we enjoy a legal system which is based on the doctrine of case precedent, or <I>stare decisis</I>. The way the common law operates is illustrated in the immortal words of one legal commentator who observed that it "stands as a monument slowly raised, like a coral reef, from the minute accretions of past individuals, of whom each built upon the relics which his predecessors left, and in turn left a foundation upon which his successors might work." 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The growth and development of the common law depends on input from and cross-fertilization with other common law jurisdictions. No common law system can, by definition, survive in a vacuum. Accordingly, we cite in our courts on a regular, if not actually daily, basis decisions not merely of our own jurisdiction, but also those of the House of Lords in England, the Privy Council, the High Court of Australia, the Court of Appeal in New Zealand, the Supreme Court of Canada, and last, but by no means least, the United States Supreme Court and the United States Appeals Courts, to pick but a few prominent examples from the extensive reach of the common law patrimony. The continuation of this system is guaranteed both by international treaty (the Sino-British Joint Declaration) and by constitutional provisions (the Basic Law), which form the twin cornerstones of our future legal edifice. Hong Kong will remain locked into the international grid as a member of the common law family, wherefore, after 1997, we will continue to cite in our courts in appropriate cases the decisions of your superior courts.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The provisions girding our future have been erected and can be viewed structurally at a number of different levels, at the international legal or treaty level as well as at the domestic constitutional level. Before we embark on this survey, we should remind ourselves that Hong Kong's transition towards resumption of the exercise of Chinese sovereignty has been an extremely long one. Our odyssey began over 12 years ago, at the end of 1984, when the treaty known as the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed between the outgoing and the incoming sovereign powers. It will be complete on June 30, 1997. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We have entered the last 500 days of this long journey. We have reached, in other words, the home stretch of our unique thirteen-and-a-half year marathon. Such a long transition holds certain advantages. It allows us periodically to pause and take stock of our progress, to look back over the long road down which we have travelled. And when we undertake this retrospective, we see four major milestones which mark, like rites of passage, our oftimes arduous trek towards resumption of the exercise of Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong. These milestones can be represented temporally by the years 1984, 1990, 1991 and 1995.
<p>
<b>THE SINO-BRITISH JOINT DECLARATION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Our story begins in 1984. In that annus mirabilis, the People's Republic of China and the United Kingdom, following two years of hard negotiations inaugurated in 1982 by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's visit to Beijing, entered into a solemn agreement known as the Sino-British Joint Declaration (the Joint Declaration). The Joint Declaration is a bilateral treaty enforceable under international law and registered with the United Nations. It binds the outgoing sovereign, Britain, on the one hand into transferring sovereignty over Hong Kong to China, subject to certain specified conditions and safeguards, and the incoming sovereign, China, on the other, upon resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, into giving her people "a high degree autonomy" under Deng Xiaoping's famous twin dicta "One Country,Two Systems" and "Hong Kong People Ruling Hong Kong."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Save only in respect of defense and foreign affairs, Hong Kong after 1997 will be designated a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China and be self-governing. In short, it will be self-governing at least to the same extent as it is self-governing today. As I shall endeavor to demonstrate later, in certain specific areas, Hong Kong will actually enjoy a degree of autonomy after 1997 even higher than that which it enjoys today.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under the Joint Declaration, Hong Kong will maintain her present freedoms and lifestyle as well as her own political, economic, social, cultural, legal, and judicial systems fundamentally different and separate from those of the rest of China. Capitalism will continue to be practiced as the order of the day. Socialism as state policy will not be applied. We will maintain our own currency, the Hong Kong dollar: a hard currency, freely convertible, a tool of international trade, different from the <I>renminbi</I>, pegged to the U.S. dollar, and backed up by US$49 billion of reserves. Hong Kong will remain a separate customs territory. We will remain a separate fiscal area and a tax haven. No taxes will be remitted to the Central People's Government. We will practice fiscal conservatism and expend strictly within the limits of our revenue income. We will keep our own shipping and aircraft registers. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hong Kong will maintain its own international persona separate from the rest of China. For example, we are a founder-member of the World Trade Organization (WTO). China is not. Hong Kong will retain its status in the WTO post-1997, whether or not China becomes a member of that body. We are a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Council (APEC), sitting alongside China in that forum. After 1997, we will retain our seat on APEC. We will continue to participate at international activities and conferences under a new name, Hong Kong China. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Last but not least, the Joint Declaration specifically provides for our existing legal system to survive unchanged. In particular, it provides for the common law to continue to be applied. Hong Kong will maintain her own legal system based on the common law, which will be quarantined from that of the rest of China. PRC laws will not be applied in Hong Kong. We will have our own self-contained judicial system with the ability to exercise, for the first time in our history, power of final adjudication. Our very own Court of Final Appeal will be established in Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, to replace the Privy Council in London as the ultimate arbiter of disputes within the Special Administrative Region. No PRC court will occupy such a position. There will be no overarching supreme court established to oversee the operations of the Court of Final Appeal.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The implications of the Joint Declaration are far-reaching. It adumbrates the beginnings of an experiment by the PRC with a form of government that has gone way beyond the federal model. No federal state of which I am aware would tolerate a similar degree of separateness or autonomy on the part of any one region within the same country.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Joint Declaration is striking in yet another respect: It contains an annex. By Annex I to the Joint Declaration, a document longer than the Joint Declaration itself but which forms part and parcel of the treaty and is also registered with the United Nations, the People's Republic of China commits to writing its basic policies governing Hong Kong after 1997. It fleshes out the provisions of the Joint Declaration proper and reiterates, among other matters, the separateness of Hong Kong's legal and judicial systems from those of the mainland and the continued application of the common law to Hong Kong with all that that implies. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In Part XIII of Annex I, the People's Republic of China made plain that the provisions of the two principal international human rights covenants sponsored by the United Nations -- namely, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) -- which have been applied to Hong Kong since 1976 will continue to be applied to Hong Kong post-1997. And that is not all. In the context of fundamental common law doctrine that international legal and treaty rights and obligations do not automatically become justifiable domestically, China also made plain that those international legal provisions will be enforceable domestically in Hong Kong through Hong Kong law. And this is so despite the fact that China is not yet a signatory to either multilateral treaty.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Finally, the Joint Declaration is remarkable in yet another respect: It obliges the People's Republic of China to reduce its stated policies and treaty obligations to an enforceable domestic form. In other words, it obliges China to enact a future mini-constitution for Hong Kong. This has now become a reality. The Joint Declaration was signed in December 1984, and was ratified by the U.K. Parliament in May 1985. In mid-1985, an unprecedented process of drafting the Basic Law in consultation with the people of Hong Kong commenced and lasted for five years until April of 1990, when the process was complete and the Basic Law promulgated. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This was an unprecedented exercise in both the Chinese and Hong Kong context. Unprecedented in the Chinese context since they have never before drafted a constitution for a particular region about to be incorporated into the country. Unprecedented in the Hong Kong context because we have never before possessed a comprehensive written constitution: Our closest present equivalent to a written constitution are the Letters Patent, cast in general terms, which constitute instructions from Her Majesty the Queen to the Governor. Unprecedented also by reason of the open manner in which the exercise was carried out: It embraced people from all walks of life, both expert and non-expert, lawyers as well as laymen. The process was carried out by two committees -- the Basic Law Drafting Committee and the Basic Law Consultative Committee. The Basic Law Consultative Committee comprised exclusively Hong Kong persons; the Basic Law Drafting Committee comprised partly mainland and partly Hong Kong members. Wearing a different hat as a practicing member of the private bar (as I then was), I participated in that process as a member of the Consultative Committee.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hong Kong's Future Mini-Constitution: The Basic Law. As a result of that exercise, a 160-article mini-constitution was promulgated in April 1990. Article 8 of the Basic Law makes it plain that the pre-existing legal system -- that is to say, the common law, rules of equity, pre-existing legislation, subsidiary legislation, customary law -- will all be preserved post-1997, save only for those which contravene the mini-constitution. In Chapter 3 of the Basic Law, 19 articles are set out, and they lay down specific and discrete guarantees of human rights protections in specific areas. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
One article among the 19 stands head and shoulders above the rest. It is more pregnant with meaning than the rest. That is Article 39. It provides that the provisions of the two international human rights covenants, the ICCPR and ICESCR, will continue to apply to Hong Kong through the laws of Hong Kong. The Basic Law realizes the promises and guarantees made in the Joint Declaration at the domestic level. It will be enforceable as law interpreted by our courts, and challenges can be made in accordance with our system of common law challenges.
<p>
<b>HONG KONG'S BILL OF RIGHTS </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The third milestone along the road to Chinese sovereignty is 1991. In 1991, we enacted for the first time a bill of rights. Those of you who are familiar with British constitutional history and development will appreciate that written constitutions and written bills of rights were and, to a certain extent, still are regarded as anathema by traditionalists in the United Kingdom. That attitude stems historically from the fact that England, as the <I>fons et origo</I> of the common law, considered the system of practices, conventions, and case law constituting the common law to be so ingrained and entrenched in their psyche and culture that there was no need for that body of jurisprudence to be reduced to a comprehensive written form. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In other words, the proposition was "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."  This philosophy, if it ever gained currency within metropolitan soil, translates less happily to dependent territories because it is supposed, with some justification, that the common law enjoys a degree of entrenchment and impregnation into the psyche of dependency communities altogether more shallow than that of the mother country. That is why one finds that, as dependent territories evolve away from the colonial mold to a state of either independence (the standard model) or subsumption under a different sovereignty (in the case of Hong Kong), they have invariably been given written constitutions with bills of rights incorporated. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The same approach was taken in Hong Kong's case when we as a government sponsored and enacted a bill of rights after a gestation period of four-and-a-half years which commenced in 1987. Again, wearing a different hat as a practicing member of the private bar, I played a small role in that process. Hong Kong's Bill of Rights is unique in more senses than one. Unique since we have never had a bill of rights before. Unique also because we have replicated in our Bill almost verbatim the exact same provisions of the ICCPR. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Of the 130-odd countries around the world which have acceded to the international covenant, we are unique in being the only place that has domesticated those provisions. Our continuing dialogue with the United Nations Human Rights Committee and other U.N. agencies dealing with human rights reveals that no other country or territory has ever done so. Being an international covenant, it is free of so-called Asian values. We have a unique, universalist, culturally bias-free Bill of Rights.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Our Bill of Rights is interesting in another respect, inasmuch as we have lifted the provisions of the ICCPR and placed them in a common law context. Being a common law jurisdiction, we regularly interpret the provisions of our Bill of Rights and amplify, explain, interpolate, and extrapolate from those provisions so as to render the Bill a living body of jurisprudence instead of merely a piece of paper expressing platitudes. In the course of interpretation, we rely on decisions from other common law jurisdictions, including those I have previously mentioned such as the House of Lords in England, the Privy Council, the High Court of Australia, the New Zealand Court of Appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court, the Supreme Court of Canada, and the Supreme Court of India. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Additionally, we have gone beyond the common law world. We have looked at the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, as well as those of the U.N. Human Rights Committee, in coming to our own conclusions. Over the four-and-a-half years since the passage of the Bill of Rights, we have built up a sizeable corpus of jurisprudence which renders meaningful and real the provisions of the Bill. Our body of case law is home-grown, yet saturated with international learning. It is a unique synthesis of local and international common as well as non-common law jurisprudence. I have it on good authority that our experiment is looked upon with great interest by many other common law as well as non-common law jurisdictions around the world.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Before I leave this subject, it is important to bear in mind that our Bill of Rights dovetails neatly with both the international treaty, the Joint Declaration, and our future mini-constitutional law, the Basic Law. Bearing in mind that both the Joint Declaration and Article 39 of the Basic Law provide for the provisions of the international covenants being applied and enforceable through the laws of Hong Kong, our Bill of Rights realizes that promise. It has actually completed the task of domesticating those provisions. The Hong Kong Bill of Rights constitutes, in essence, a domestic amplification of the corresponding mini-constitutional and international treaty provisions.
<p>
<b>HONG KONG'S COURT OF FINAL APPEAL STATUTE</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Last year we passed the last milestone. 1995 was the date when the Court of Final Appeal Ordinance was enacted by a landslide vote of our legislature. It makes our judicial system complete and repatriates our court of last resort to Hong Kong in the form of the Court of Final Appeal, replacing the Privy Council in London. The significance of this development cannot be overestimated, because we have hitherto always had the Privy Council in London as our court of last resort. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Between 1982 and 1984, the solution to this particular conundrum was much debated in the course of Sino-British dialogue over the future of Hong Kong. One obvious and logical solution placed on the agenda was "mirror-imaging," which would require replacing the Privy Council in London with a Court of Final Appeal in Beijing after 1997. However, after two years of hard negotiations, the architects of the Joint Declaration -- both Britain and China -- are to be congratulated in arriving at a uniquely Hong Kong solution to a Hong Kong problem, which is to establish the Court of Final Appeal as a common law court physically located in Hong Kong as opposed to Beijing.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Court of Final Appeal has five seats. Led by the Chief Justice, it comprises three other permanent appointees, with the fifth slot being filled on invitation, on an ambulatory and ad hoc basis, by invitees selected from one of two panels, a panel of local jurists and a panel of overseas jurists. Such invitation may be made as the nature of the case may require so that if, say, a maritime dispute were on the agenda, an Admiralty expert may be invited from London to assist the court. In terms of membership of the court, the overriding consideration is that all the members must be common lawyers. No PRC judge would be admitted. On the overseas panel, we expect to have eminent common law jurists from all over the world. I suppose if we should be lucky enough, we might have one or more justices, either serving or retired, of the U.S. Supreme Court sitting on that panel. We would almost certainly have members of the House of Lords, as well as Privy Councillors from the Antipodes, sitting on the overseas panel.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So far as concerns the permanent appointees, there is no nationality requirement, save only for the Chief Justice, who must be a Hong Kong Chinese individual with no foreign nationality. The other three permanent appointees need not be Chinese nationals at all, and if the present composition of our Court of Appeal should offer any guide, I would anticipate the majority of the Court of Final Appeal judges to be non-nationals. Of all countries in the world, only China has allowed for such an open system. I know of no other jurisidiction that allows for non-resident aliens giving an input at the highest level of the judicial machinery. This would rightly reflect the reality of Hong Kong as an international, cosmopolitan city.
<p>

<b>HONG KONG - A CIVIL SOCIETY</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So much for the structural underpinnings of the rule of law in Hong Kong. However, as all of us are well aware, structural underpinnings are a necessary but by no means a sufficient element for guaranteeing the preservation of the rule of law or of a civil society in Hong Kong after 1997. We must probe further. One has to examine how the law operates in action. One has to look also at the culture of the relevant society. One has to inquire whether the population regards the rule of law as an invisible but indispensable aspect of their everyday lives in much the same way as people in the United States or the United Kingdom take the rule of law for granted. The question, in other words, is whether Hong Kong is a civil society.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Had that question been put to me in 1984 at the time of the signing of the Joint Declaration, I would have had to couch my answer with considerable reservations. The same question asked of me today would elicit a much more categorical, positive response. I suppose that, because we have a set transition of finite duration with a scheduled target date, it has the effect of concentrating the mind immensely: not unlike the old adage of a condemned man's mind being wonderfully concentrated upon being informed of his scheduled date of execution! 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Back in 1984, we were fully aware that in 13 years' time, the resumption of the exercise of Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong will take place, wherefore it was necessary to put our house in order. What has happened over the last 12 years is that, as a result of a process of public education which we as a government have sponsored, we have witnessed a sea change in the attitude of the people of Hong Kong towards the importance of the rule of law as an indispensable underpinning of a civil society. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Statistics on the numbers of writs issued, cases decided, or legal principles laid down by our courts tell, perhaps, a less eloquent story than an examination of our popular culture. Since the mid-1980s, we have enjoyed in Hong Kong a number of hugely successful television series as well as feature films, being homegrown equivalents to "L.A. Law."  These portray bewigged and begowned barristers cross-examining witnesses in court, solicitors taking instructions from lay clients: in short, the lives and loves of lawyers which constitute the very stuff of legal soap opera. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
These are not propaganda pieces produced by the government. And if we were to attempt anything of that ilk, they would not sell!  On the contrary, these are commercially viable programs and movies that have been devised to show the machinery of justice in action, breathing life into the related themes of justice pursued and justice denied. And if the man or woman in the street cannot readily identify with the issues explored on celluloid, then these ventures would surely flop. The fact that they have not done so but have, on the contrary, broken box office records speaks volumes.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So far as human rights culture is concerned, we have also embarked since 1991 on an ambitious program whereby we supply, free of charge, to all secondary schools in Hong Kong human rights teaching kits which are used by the teachers to teach schoolchildren human rights in lay terms as part of their civic education curriculum. We have also produced video tapes and cartoon booklets on human rights. So successful has this been that the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, when they examined Hong Kong in 1994, paid us the ultimate compliment of pronouncing Hong Kong as having done more in propagating and educating its population on human rights than any other country or place that has acceded to the Covenant.
<p>
<b>SURVIVAL OF THE RULE OF LAW IN HONG KONG AFTER 1997</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So much for the structures, the practices, the culture. Will all this survive the transition?  Will we still see the same dynamics at work post-1997?  This is the ultimate question to which I adverted at the outset. In advancing a cautiously optimistic prognosis, may I cite seven principal factors.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Structural Underpinnings.</b> First of all, the existence of the structural underpinnings, being the foundations of our system, should not be underestimated. They are not meaningless pieces of paper. The treaty (the Joint Declaration) is registered with the United Nations. There exists also the mini-constitution (the Basic Law), which will become a living law because it will be part of a common law system.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>The System's Track Record Throughout the Transition.</b> The proof of the pudding lies, of course, in the eating of it, which leads onto my second factor, which is that our system works and has worked in Hong Kong and has been seen to work throughout the transition. We have been undergoing 12 consecutive years of transition to conclude in a reversion to Chinese sovereignty, and the process has been nothing if not traumatic. It would be disingenuous of me to pretend otherwise. And it would be surprising were that not the case, because we are dealing with real people, people with families and children who worry about their future as well as their children's future.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
However, despite the unavoidable uncertainties, despite the worries and concerns, Hong Kong has not gone the way of, say, the former Yugoslavia. There is no bloodshed on our streets. On the contrary, we have not merely survived, we have flourished. So much so that for every single year since 1984, Hong Kong experienced real growth, in double-digit terms throughout the 1980s and in single-digits throughout the 1990s. And the only reason for the deceleration in real growth is that, as the economists tell us, we have now reached a stage of development whereby single-digit figures are something for which any developed economy would be grateful. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We have a standard of living which exceeds that of Britain, Sweden, and most Western European nations. We are the fourth-biggest trading power in the world after the European Union, the United States, and Japan. If European Union countries are to be split up into separate sovereign states, we then are the sixth-largest trading power in the world. We are the world's fourth-largest financial center after London, New York, and Tokyo. We have the world's largest container port. We are the premier services center in East Asia and the Western Pacific. None of the above would be the case if Hong Kong were not served by a viable, mature, efficient, and incorrupt legal and judicial system. Those facts stare China in the face.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Hong Kong's Economic Integration with China.</b> The third factor is China's self-interest, based on Hong Kong and China's ever-closer economic integration. I am often asked the question what will happen in 1997. The answer is that 1997 will come as something of an anticlimax. This is because economically we are already integrated with China, so that 1997 will present itself as a date when the political forms catch up with the economic reality. China has enormous stakes in Hong Kong. We still account for 40 percent of China's hard currency earnings. We are by far China's biggest trading partner. Figures for the year ending September 1995 show trade between Hong Kong and China in the region of HK$731 billion, which is just under US$100 billion. We are also the largest single foreign investor in China. The capital value of our investments is US$66 billion. This dwarfs anything invested by the United States, Japan, or the European Union.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If you were to trace Hong Kong's economic development from a light manufacturing center in the 1970s into a services center by the mid-1980s, you will see our curious metamorphosis into a post-industrial society. Although rising labor and housing costs rendered it no longer economic to manufacture in Hong Kong, we have paradoxically not lost our manufacturing base. We merely relocated our factories north of the border. In the Pearl River Delta area of Southern Guangdong Province alone, you will find 4,000 manufacturing concerns established with Hong Kong capital. Economists talk accordingly of Greater Hong Kong as a cohesive economic unit of 70 million people, which is about the size of West Germany before unification and larger than the present-day France. Little wonder, then, that we are able to maintain our position as the fourth-biggest trading power anywhere in the world. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
China happens also to be the biggest single investor in Hong Kong. China has capital investments in Hong Kong valued at US$31 billion. Again, this dwarfs investment by any other country. Hong Kong's financial markets are a natural vehicle for the raising of capital by Chinese companies by the so-called H shares. Hong Kong's banking system which is the best in Asia is a natural haven for Chinese savings.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The point of this argument is that increasing economic integration between Hong Kong and China makes for a "soft landing" in 1997. Conversely, if Hong Kong and China's respective economies were not even on speaking terms with each other, then we may be in for rather a rude shock come 1997. German unification following the demolition of the Berlin Wall holds a salutary lesson. Germany today is paying the price for want of economic integration between the two territories during the period of division, and looks set to continue to pay such price for a generation to come. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Existentializing Hong Kong's Legal Values.</b> I have already canvassed the domestic existentializing of legal culture which led to the creation of a civil society in Hong Kong. Looking at the Hong Kong-China relationship, if one were to ask the question in 1984, at the time of the signing of the Joint Declaration, whether China truly understood what made Hong Kong tick and whether they appreciated the value of our system, only a dyed-in-the-wool optimist would give a positive response. Even if experts such as economists could glimpse at the argument, it was unlikely that party leaders could existentialize it in their everyday lives. In those days, contact between the mainland and Hong Kong was sparse at best. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Today, however, the psychological landscape has changed beyond recognition. The sons and daughters of the Party elite live and work in Hong Kong. They put their savings in our banks; they buy our stocks; they speculate on our financial markets; they drive our cars; they punt on our racetracks: They live the Hong Kong life and they enjoy it!  The degree of qualitative as well as quantitative understanding in China of Hong Kong's system and what makes it work has increased exponentially. Little wonder that in the Chinese blueprint, we are slated to become the Manhattan-cum-Switzerland for China post-1997.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>The Taiwan Factor.</b>Let us turn now to the Taiwan factor. I do not believe this consideration can ever be swept aside. It operates as a negative disincentive. By that, I mean that if the transition for Hong Kong were to proceed smoothly, it does not mean that Taiwan will come running back to the Chinese fold. Beijing knows that; Taipei knows that; Hong Kong also knows that. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But the three of us are also well aware that, if the transition for Hong Kong were to proceed badly, if Hong Kong should stumble, then the chances for peaceful reunification between the mainland and Taiwan become eliminated entirely. And for all the saber-rattling that has been going on across the Taiwan Strait over the last four months, which I daresay will reach a climax by March this year to coincide with the Presidential election in Taiwan, I for one do not think that peaceful reunification is off the agenda for China. Jiang Zemin cannot afford to take it off the agenda, wherefore it is a factor which must be weighed in the balance.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>The Dragon Wakes.</b> The sixth factor is the most far-reaching. China is a country that has undergone double digit real growth for the last ten consecutive years. In the southernmost provinces which abut Hong Kong such as Guangdong and Fujian, real growth for the last four years had been over 30 percent, which has hitherto been unheard of in recent human history. What this means is that the lives as well as expectations of a quarter of humanity have been transformed, together with the buildup of attendant pressures for economic liberalization and political reforms on the Central People's Government and the provincial authorities which have only partially been met. We are not able to grasp the full consequences of this change because we are much too close to the trees to see the wood. All we say with reasonable certainty is that the economic transformation of China is an event of significance to be compared to the coming of the Industrial Revolution in 19th century Europe.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Hong Kong's Role as Interpreter and Mentor for China.</b> Hong Kong stands at the vortex of this radical metamorphosis. We do so as dictated by history and geography. Hong Kong acts not merely as the bankers for China's modernization and the engine for her economic growth; we form also the natural interface between China and the international community. Hong Kong is the obvious interpreter for China in her dealings with the outside world. We do not throw up the same sort of cultural and linguistic barriers which China encounters when dealing directly with the outside world. Conversely, the international community tends to encounter less pain when they deal with China via Hong Kong than if they were to deal with China directly. Those among you who engage in or advise on China trade know the story full well.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So we play this role of interpreter and mentor. What this means in the legal sphere is that China looks to us for guidance and for advice. Since about the mid-1980s, China has been fascinated by the common law. Why the common law?  Because China can appreciate it as the instrument for dispute resolution <I>par excellence</I>. The common law, with its doctrine of binding precedent, is able to project a degree of precision and predictability to dispute resolution which is absent from the continental system.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since about 1987, at least three different law schools in China have been studying Hong Kong law as a specialty and translating our laws into Chinese. Why Hong Kong law?  Perhaps because Hong Kong law is the most user-friendly of the common law systems from the Chinese perspective. They can see it operate in the Hong Kong context. They can see its successes. They can measure its effectiveness. They encounter less of a cultural and linguisitic barrier when studying Hong Kong law than that of another common law system such as the American model. Last but not least, we happen conveniently to be the most politically acceptable member of the common law family since we will soon be part of the one sovereign state.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We have actually overtaken these mainland law schools in the translation of our laws into Chinese. We now draft all our present and future legislation bilingually, in Chinese and in English, with two teams working in tandem. The end-product we supply to our Chinese counterparts, principally the Legislative Affairs Commission of the National People's Congress, not because we are obliged to but in order to stimulate their interest and often at their request. We have supplied the NPC Legislative Affairs Commission with our bankruptcy law, our companies legislation, and other commercial legislation which they have consulted in drafting their own laws.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At the regional level, the degree of influence we exercise is more striking. Let us consider, for example, Shenzhen, which is our immediate northern neighbor. Shenzhen is the first of the special economic zones established by China in 1979. At the time, Shenzhen was a sleepy border town with a string of paddy fields. It is now a bustling city of 3 million. Since 1992, Shenzhen has been given legislative autonomy. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This means that Shenzhen can pass its own laws, different and separate from those of the rest of the country, through its own Shenzhen People's Congress. In the last three-and-a-half years, Shenzhen has enacted approximately 250 pieces of primary and subsidiary legislation, of which fully two-thirds are plagiarized from the Hong Kong statute books with our blessing and cooperation and without charge for copyright royalties!  They are highly appreciative of our efforts. The Standing Committee Shenzhen People's Congress has indicated to me, shortly before I commenced this speaking tour, that Shenzhen wants to achieve legal parity with Hong Kong, leading eventually to economic integration with us.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
That aspiration constitutes, at the moment, little more than a pipedream. It is also moot whether such a scheme would be permissible under the Basic Law. However, the more important fact to bear in mind is that the common law is not, of course, just a collection of statutes. The common law is a living body of case law. It is also a set of practices and values. The common law partakes of a certain spirit, a certain philosophy, a certain approach which respects the principle of the independence of the judiciary, which respects the independence of the legal profession, and which demands a minimum degree of objectivity and professionalism. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Perhaps not surprisingly, the Shenzhen government is interested in having their lawyers trained by the Attorney General's Chambers in Hong Kong, and we have commenced a dialogue on this issue. In the same manner, we have commenced a dialogue on training lawyers at the level of both the Central People's Government and provincial governments.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We already administer a program of training young Chinese private sector lawyers, jointly with the Overseas Development Aid Office of the British Government, the British Council, the English bar, the English Law Society, and London University whereby 12 of the ablest young Chinese lawyers are selected every year and sent to be trained in England for ten months. They spend the first four months at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London University, where they are taught the rudiments of the English legal system and the use of legal English, whereafter they spend the next three months attached to leading solicitors' firms, followed by a further three months' attachment with barristers chambers in the Temple and Lincoln's Inn. At the end of their ten months' English experience, the trainees come to Hong Kong, where they spend their final two months working in the Hong Kong private sector milieu before returning to China. As result, we now have an expanding network of alumni spread throughout the country, which will serve us well after 1997.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We also help in the training of Chinese judges, who constitute, of course, key players in the judicial system. It is common ground that, currently, the degree of professionalism of the Chinese judiciary leaves much to be desired. Since 1992, the Supreme People's Court has set up a Senior Judges Training Center. Every year, 120 judges are selected from all over the country, given a year's sabbatical, and sent in two batches of 60 each to, respectively, Peking University Law School and People's University Law School to undergo specialist training. Afterwards the trainees return to the various provinces and cities from whence they came. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We are in the process of negotiating the incorporation of a common law component into that training program. We hope to bring these senior judges down to Hong Kong to undergo training, using funds to be made available in Hong Kong for that purpose. The Supreme People's Court has recently also set up a Senior Judges Educational Foundation, on which I have been asked to sit as one of the founding honorary directors. We hope through this foundation to enhance much-needed professionalism for Chinese judges.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What of the legal profession?  Under the common law or in any mature legal system, the legal profession practices independently of government. Currently, Chinese lawyers are licensed to practice by the Ministry of Justice. The Ministry of Justice indicates that they intend to privatize the Chinese bar within 18 months. That was their stated target date in August last year. We can reasonably expect the Chinese bar to be rendered independent of the government sometime before 1997.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At the national level, we see the development of another phenomenon: that is, the beginnings of a case law system in China. Since 1992, the Supreme People's Court has been publishing reports of their case decisions on an annual basis in four volumes. Volume One is administrative law;Volume Two, criminal law; Volume Three, civil law; and Volume Four, economic law. It would be risible, however, to pretend that by this means, China will shortly be joining the common law family, for these reports have no binding force as we understand that term to be within a common law context, although they are of high persuasive value. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The implications are nevertheless clear; namely, that China is travelling down a road not dissimilar to that taken by France and Germany not so long ago when they started publishing law reports of their superior courts. That took place as a result of the pressures of European economic integration. In the Chinese context, the spur to change has likewise been economic in origin; namely, the Chinese modernization program. Last year, the task of translating into English the China Law Reports was complete and published by Butterworths, the leading publisher of common law legal texts outside of the United States. We in the Attorney General's Chambers in Hong Kong, as well as I personally, have played a small role in this process of preparing the English edition, which will be published on an annual basis.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The foregoing are but illustrations of remarkable developments in China in which we play a role, often modest, at times crucial, but all of which will assist in the modernization of the country. Hong Kong stands in the vortex of this process of seminal change in the biggest country in the world. In coming to some sort of prognosis as to what will happen to Hong Kong and to China after 1997, one must weigh in the balance the various provisions we have made for continuation of the system, the economic reality in the case of the Hong Kong-China synergy, <I>realpolitik</I> in the case of China's relations with Taiwan and with the outside world -- in particular, the United States response to China's changing relationship with Taiwan -- and, last but by no means least, self-interest on the part of China. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
All of the above will combine to shorten the odds on our system surviving, and not merely surviving <I>simpliciter</I>, but also influencing change within China itself. 1997 will present itself as a unique opportunity for engineering positive and constructive change in China for the benefit not just of China and Hong Kong, but also the entire Asia-Pacific Region and, by extension, the rest of the world. This will come about as a natural development, since after 1997 Hong Kong will be able to play the role of mentor and interpreter from the inside, that is to say from within the Chinese body politic. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I often liken Hong Kong's special role to that of playing Virgil to China's Dante, showing Dante the way ahead, in a late 20th century re-enactment of the <I>Divine Comedy</i> in an East Asian setting to herald the impending dawn of the Pacific Century. And after traversing Hell and Purgatory, eventually we will hopefully reach also Paradise at the end of our journey.

<title> The Flat Tax Cuts Individual Income Taxes in Every State -- Heritage</title>

<p>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 86<br>
February 7, 1996
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<a href="fyi86t1.gif">Table 1</a>: States That Benefit Most from a 17% Flat Tax<br>
<a href="fyi86a1.gif">Appendix 1</a>: Comparison of Average Household Tax Payments by State under Current Tax Law and a Flat Tax of 17% and 20%<br>
<a href="fyi86a2.gif">Appendix 2</a>: Comparison of Total Tax Payments by State under Current Tax Law and under a Flat Tax of 17% and 20%<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;With support from many presidential candidates and a ringing endorsement from the <a href="/taxcom/reptoc.html">National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform</a>, the idea of a flat tax has captured the imagination of long-suffering taxpayers. This support should come as no surprise. The current system, which penalizes work, saving, investment, and entrepreneurship, imposes nearly $200 billion of compliance costs on the economy and corrupts the political process.<sup>1</sup>  By contrast, a flat tax would spur growth while treating taxpayers equally. Moreover, a properly designed flat tax also would provide much-needed tax relief. As <a href="fyi86t1.gif">Table 1</a> indicates, the benefits of the flat tax to individual taxpayers would be considerable.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The <a href="fyi86t1.gif">table</a> compares how individual income taxpayers will fare if the current system is replaced by a 17 percent flat tax.<sup>2</sup>  Such a reform proposal would tax individual wage and salary income at a 17 percent rate and would apply the same rate, at the business level, to all interest earnings, dividends, capital gains, and other non-labor income.<sup>3</sup>

<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Besides the rates and deductions, the biggest difference between the flat tax and today's code is the way the flat tax treats income from savings, equities, appreciated capital assets, and estates. Flat tax proposals based on the Hall-Rabushka model, such as the <a href="http://www.house.gov/armey.flattax/">Armey-Shelby</a> bill, do not double-tax savings or estate income, since the principal used to create such income streams already has been taxed and, in the case of interest income, reflects in part the level of taxes paid by financial institutions. Dividends and capital gains also are not taxed at the individual level, because taxes are paid at the business level on the income that creates dividends and produces appreciation in the value of capital assets.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a href="fyi86t1.gif">Table 1</a> shows, for example, that Connecticut's per household tax liability drops by $1,856 under a flat tax of 17 percent. The 17 percent flat tax saves New Yorkers filing individual income tax returns almost $10 billion, and the total individual tax bill in South Dakota falls by 38 percent. Appendices 1 and 2 present <a href="fyi86a1.gif">average</a> and <a href="fyi86a2.gif">total</a> tax savings for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. It is important to note that these tables argue only that average tax liabilities and the total tax bill will be reduced under a flat tax of 17 percent, not that all taxpayers will see their taxes reduced.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some critics of the flat tax have complained that it is not possible to reduce everyone's taxes and still have a tax system that produces about the same amount of federal revenue as the current one does. They are right, of course. Generally, lower taxes on individuals are made possible by two factors. The many proposals based on the Hall-Rabushka model,<sup>4</sup> for example, would cause a shift in the tax burden to corporations. These higher taxes, needless to say, ultimately are borne by individual workers, consumers, and shareholders, but the actual payment of the tax takes place at the corporate level.<sup>5</sup>  The second reason individuals will enjoy dramatically lower tax payments is that sponsors of the legislation want to reduce the amount of money the government takes out of the private sector. Cutting federal spending over a seven-year period, for example, would enable Congress to reduce tax rates. The flat tax, in other words, is designed both to cut taxes and to reform the system to make it fair. To avoid higher deficits, the lower level of revenue collections would be offset by spending savings and the additional revenues generated by stronger economic growth.
<p>
<b>WHAT IS THE FLAT TAX?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The flat tax would repeal the current income tax code and replace it with a system based on the following principles:
<p><ul>
<li> Tax all income with no deductions except a generous allowance based on family size. Today's complex system could be replaced by two simple, postcard-sized forms, one for business and one for individuals.
<p>
<li> Tax all income at one rate, applying the law equally to all taxpayers. A taxpayer with ten times the taxable income of his neighbor would pay ten times as much in taxes.
<p>
<li>Tax all income just once, ending the bias against savings and investment. Capital income would be taxed on the business form to ensure compliance, and labor income would be taxed on the individual form.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;With so much interest in replacing today's unfair tax code with a system that rewards productive behavior, ends special-interest lobbying, and forces everyone to play by the same rules, policymakers and other interested parties have been clamoring for more details about the impact of this proposed reform. The state-by-state figures demonstrate the amount of tax relief individual taxpayers will realize if the 17 percent flat tax proposed in the Armey-Shelby bill for the 1994 tax year is enacted into law.
<p>

<b>A Note on Technical Matters</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The "current" tax liabilities in <a href="fyi86a1.gif">Appendix 1</a> include all of the kinds of taxable income that individuals now report on their annual 1040 tax form. Individuals currently report their labor income (for example, wages and salaries) as well as business income from self-employment, trusts, partnerships, farming operations, and other business activities. However, the more prominent flat tax proposals make an important change in the way small business income is reported. Proposals similar to the Armey-Shelby bill separate labor income from business income and allow businesses to deduct from their gross income the costs of operations, the value of land and capital structures purchased during the year, and the wages and salaries paid to their employees. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This separation of labor from business income makes comparing the current tax system to a flat tax system difficult. In order to compare current taxes fairly with those collected under a flat tax, we added together the flat taxes individuals would pay on their labor income and on their small business income. This combination is reported in the flat tax columns of Appendices <a href="fyi86a1.gif">1</a> and <a href="fyi86a2.gif">2</a>. Thus, both sets of numbers include taxes paid on labor and business income. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The data shown in <a href="fyi86t1.gif">Table 1</a> and Appendices 1 and 2 are based on income tax records contained on the I.R.S. Public Use File for 1991, a statistically accurate sample of all individual income tax returns for that year. The file contains 155,000 taxpaying households and 178 tax variables per household. When a variable is multiplied by its weight, the value of the variable equals its national total. Thus, the value of wage and salary income for a family earning $35,000 equals the national total for families in that income class when it is multiplied by its national weight. These are the same data the IRS's own Statistics of Income Division uses when preparing its annual analysis of taxpayers. They are the most accurate and complete tax data available for public use, and the data for tax year 1991 are the most current data available.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Heritage adjusted the state-by-state estimates of current and flat tax liabilities drawn from the I.R.S. Public Use File for 1991 by multiplying these estimates by the total change in the CPI-U between December 1991 and December 1994. Adjusting our 1991 estimates by the CPI-U produced 1994 estimates that were within 0.6 percent of actual collections. We chose December 1994 rather than December 1995 as our terminal point because estimates for annual federal revenue collected through the income tax are not particularly sound until June of the next year. It also is worth noting that the Public Use File for 1994 is not yet available.

<li>    The Heritage Foundation has published a number of papers on tax reform and on the flat tax specifically. See, for example, Daniel J. Mitchell, "Jobs, Growth, Freedom, and Fairness: Why America Needs A Flat Tax," Heritage Foundation <i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1035, May 25, 1995, and Daniel J. Mitchell, <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1055.html">"Which Tax Reform Plan is Best for America?</a>," Heritage Foundation <i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1055, September 26, 1995.<p>
<li>In creating these estimates, Heritage used the fully implemented flat tax proposal of Representative Richard Armey (R-TX) and Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL), H.R. 2060 and S. 1050, respectively.<p>
<li>The Armey-Shelby proposal begins with a 20 percent tax rate for individuals and businesses, which drops to a 17 percent rate after two years. Each taxpayer in a household receives a standard deduction of $10,700, and each dependent receives a $5,000 deduction. The standard deduction for heads of households is set at $14,000.<p>
<li>See Robert E. Hall and Alvin Rabushka, <i>The Flat Tax</i>, 2nd ed. (Stanford, California: Hoover Institution Press, 1995).<p>
<li>The next Heritage Foundation paper in this series on tax reform will analyze the incidence of tax change by income group stemming from replacement of the current multi-rate tax system with the Armey-Shelby flat tax proposal.

<h2>The Estate Tax: Not Worth All the Trouble</h2><BR>
by Raymond J. Keating<br>
Chief Economist
<P>
Small Business Survival Foundation<BR>
</center>
<P>
<P>
Benjamin Franklin pointed out that &quot;in this world nothing
is certain but death and taxes.&quot;  However, dying and taxing
used to be two separate events &#173;&#173; both generally faced
with trepidation.  Leave it to government to bring these two anxious
moments together in one levy &#173;&#173; the estate tax.
<P>
Of course, the estate tax inflicts great harm on family businesses.
 This government hostile takeover &#173;&#173; estate tax rates
range from 18 percent to 55 percent, reaching 60 percent for some
estates &#173;&#173; at the time of an owner's death can be too
much to overcome.  Indeed, as pointed out last year by Investor's
Business Daily (April 12, 1995), 60 percent of family businesses
fail to survive to the second generation, and 90 percent do not
make it to the third.  The estate tax acts as a leading cause
of family business deaths.  In addition, this enormous tax on
business assets offers little incentive for an owner to continue
investing in and expanding his business as he grows older.  
<P>
To say the least, the estate tax acts as a burden on the economy.
 However, the so&#173;called pay&#173;off for the government is
nominal at best.  As noted in the accompanying chart, real revenues
from federal death taxes have not grown much since 1975.  In fact,
1995 estate and gift tax revenues were actually less than their
1977 level.  On a per capita basis, inflation&#173;adjusted estate
tax revenues were down by one&#173;third between 1977 and 1995.
 In addition, estate tax revenues amounted to just over 1 percent
of total federal revenues in 1995.  Factor in compliance and litigation
efforts relating to the estate tax, and the federal government's
take drops much further (some estimate that as much as 75 percent
of estate taxes are eaten up by such costs).  Add in lost businesses,
jobs, and output, and the estate tax becomes a net loser in terms
of federal revenues.
<P>
When weighing the federal government's net revenues from the estate
tax against the considerable economic damage wrought by this levy,
 the case for eliminating the estate tax becomes crystal clear.

<h2>The Estate Tax: Another Case of Envy Run Amok</h2><BR>
by Raymond J. Keating
<br>
Chief Economist
Small Business Survival Foundation<BR>
</center>
<hr>
<P>
<P>
Envy always makes for dismal economics and bad tax policy.  We've
made this point time and again at the Small Business Survival
Foundation (for example, see &quot;The Great Tax Debate: Making
Sense of Competing Tax Plans by Raymond J. Keating, June 1995).
 Unfortunately, most of today's U.S. tax system can only be justified
on the basis of envy &#173;&#173; sound economics plays no part
at all.
<P>
The income tax, for example, diminishes incentives for working,
saving, investing, and risk taking, while at the same time, is
inefficient and intrusive.  The current U.S. income tax came into
existence in 1913.  It may have seemed fairly innocuous at first.
 Rates ranged from 1 percent to 7 percent, with the lowest rate
not taking effect until a married couple's income hit $60,000
(in inflation&#173;adjusted 1995 dollars, that is) and the top
rate not kicking in until income topped $7.4 million (again, in
1995 dollars).  In subsequent years, as we all know, income tax
rates skyrocketed, reaching ever deeper into the pockets of all
working Americans, not just the wealthy.  And for the most part,
government squandered these resources.
<P>
Following quickly on the heals of the income tax was the estate
tax, imposed in 1916.  This was another envy&#173;driven levy.
 When first imposed, the estate tax was targeted at the rich,
with rates ranging from 1 percent to 10 percent.  Today, the estate
tax takes hold at a lower threshold, with far more severe tax
rates, ranging from 18 percent to 55 percent (even 60 percent
for certain estates).  That is, since the estate tax's inception,
the lowest rate has jumped by 1,700 percent and the top rate by
more than 205 percent.  In addition, the highest tax rate would
have taken hold at an estate valued at almost $70 million under
the original estate tax structure, versus today's, with the top
rate kicking in at just over $3 million.
<P>
Efforts to cut the estate tax are worthy.  However, since no sound
economics basis exists for such a tax, and since the estate tax
serves as a major destroyer of family businesses and jobs, the
most productive step would be to eliminate the estate tax.  
<P>
Envy must give way to economics in order for entrepreneurship
and the economy to flourish.<BR>

<h2>Capital Gains Taxation and Venture Capital</h2><BR>
by Raymond J. Keating<br>
Chief Economist
<p>Small Business Survival Foundation<BR>
</center>
<hr>
<P>
<P>
   Venture capital epitomizes the great spirit of entrepreneurial
capitalism.  Visionary individuals place their resources at great
risk by investing in new ideas, inventions, and innovations &#173;&#173;
by investing in entrepreneurs.  In their own right, venture capitalists
are entrepreneurs themselves.  By making capital available to
promising enterprises, they help to create dynamic change and
growth in the economy.
<P>
   In addition to the many market&#173;based obstacles and risks
confronted by such investors, the government piles on its own
costs.  At the top of the government's destructive actions rests
the capital gains tax.  Capital gains taxation impedes risk taking
by venture capitalists by cutting into potential returns.  The
vast risks associated with venture capital investments need to
be offset by opportunities for substantial returns.  Today's lofty,
non&#173;indexed capital gains tax clearly restrains venture capital
investing, and therefore, entrepreneurship and economic growth.
 
<P>
   As noted in the accompanying chart, real capital commitments
to private venture capital funds were rising robustly prior to
a sharp increase in the capital gains tax in 1987.  The Tax Reform
Act of 1986 possessed one key flaw &#173;&#173; the capital gains
tax was increased by 40 percent, from 20 percent to 28 percent.
 In addition, since capital gains are not indexed for inflation,
the real capital gains tax rate turns out to be much higher than
this oft&#173;stated nominal rate of 28 percent. 
<P>
   Prior to the 1987 capital gains tax hike, real venture capital
commitments rose at a 29.4 percent average annual rate from 1981
to 1986.  Afterwards, the real annual rate of increase averaged
6.5 percent.  A lower capital gains tax rate would have meant
greater venture capital investment.  Indeed, if the average real
rate of increase in venture funds during the early 1980s had been
maintained, 1995 commitments might have topped $40 billion &#173;&#173;
ten times the actual 1995 level.
<P>
   Any serious effort to shift economic growth into high gear
means boosting private sector incentives for investing and risk
taking in order to get capital in the hands of entrepreneurs.
 That, in turn, means eliminating the capital gains tax.<BR>

<h2>Capital Gains and Entrepreneurship</h2><BR>
by Raymond J. Keating<br>
Chief Economist - Small Business Survival Foundation<br>
</center>
<hr>
<P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs are the driving force behind economic growth.  Therefore,
one of the most damaging levies government can impose on individuals
and the economy is the capital gains tax &#173;&#173; a direct
tax on risk taking.  After being reduced in the late 1970s and
early 1980s, the capital gains tax rate was increased by 40 percent
&#173;&#173; from 20 percent to 28 percent &#173;&#173; under
the 1986 Tax Reform Act.  
<P>
The accompanying chart shows one measure of entrepreneurial activity
 &#173;&#173; new business incorporations from 1967 to 1995. 
Since the 1986 capital gains tax hike, new business incorporations
have been quite lackluster.  The break between a powerful rise
in new business incorporations prior to 1987 and thereafter is
striking.
<P>
Lagging entrepreneurship means a lagging economy.  Along with
the Bush and Clinton tax hikes and mounting regulatory costs,
high capital gains taxes explain much of our recent sluggish economic
growth.  Annual real economic growth has averaged just 2.3 percent
since the 1986 capital gains tax hike, particularly slowing after
1989 as the relative dearth in entrepreneurship took hold.  The
Clinton Administration estimates that this anemic 2.3 percent
annual real growth rate will continue into the foreseeable future,
grossly under&#173;performing the post&#173;Civil War annual real
average rate of 3.5 percent.  
<P>
If the capital gains tax had not been increased, incentives for
investing and risk taking would not have diminished, more capital
would have been available for investment, and chances improved
for entrepreneurial activity to increase at a healthy clip.  In
fact, if new business incorporations had managed to continue at
the average annual rate of increase from the previous two decades,
we would have seen almost 2.5 million more new business incorporations
over the period 1987 to 1995.  From 1968 to 1986, new business
incorporations rose at a 6.8 percent annual rate versus a meager
1.1 percent from 1987 to 1995.  In 1995 alone, new business incorporations
would have been almost 470,000 higher than they actually were.
 These higher levels of entrepreneurship would have meant more
products, innovations, efficiencies, economic growth, and jobs.
<P>
A deep cut in the capital gains tax and indexing for inflation
would surely boost incentives for risk taking and spur economic
growth.<BR>

<h2>The Dole Economic Plan and the Entrepreneur</h2>
by Raymond J. Keating<br>
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee<br>
</center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<dd>With the announcement of the Dole economic plan, tax cuts are back on the front burner of the nation's public policy debate.  And though one can find all sorts of opinions on whether this is a good or bad thing, from the perspective of small business, entrepreneurship, and economic growth, the major proposals put forth in the Dole plan make for sound economic policy.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Cutting the capital gains tax.  The Dole plan calls for a 50 percent cut in the top capital gains tax rate on individuals from 28 percent to 14 percent.  
<p>
<dd>Barring a complete tax overhaul, there is no tax cut that will do more to spur entrepreneurship, investment, economic growth, and job creation than a sharp reduction in the capital gains tax rate.  The great hurdle to starting up and/or expanding a business remains access to capital.  Investing and entrepreneurship are high-risk endeavors.  High risks require the opportunity for substantial returns.  Slash the capital gains tax in half and you enhance the potential returns from risk-taking.
<p>
<dd>A 50 percent reduction in the capital gains tax rate would provide a major boost to small business, entrepreneurship, and the economy.
<p>
<li> Across-the-board cut in personal income taxes.  A 15 percent across-the-board cut in personal income tax rates works favorably for small business and the economy in three key ways:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Boosts incentives for individuals to work, save, invest, and take risks.  Again, this is a straightforward relative price argument -- as the old saying goes, the less you tax something, the more of it you get.
<p>
<li> Resources are shifted from the unproductive sphere of government to the productive private sector.  Or another way to put it, individuals operating in the private marketplace spend and invest their money far more efficiently and wisely than do government bureaucrats.
<p>
<li> Since about 79 percent of all business tax returns are either sole proprietorships or partnerships (the other 21 percent being corporations), then an across-the-board personal income tax cut directly impacts the bottom line of millions of U.S. businesses.  Lower taxes mean more funds available for capital investment, additional employees, et al. 
</ol>
<p>
<li> Additional measures.  The Dole plan calls for other tax cuts and reforms impacting small businesses and entrepreneurs, including: 
<p>
<ul>
<li> Unrestricted tax-free medical savings accounts (MSAs) and 100 percent deductibility for health insurance for the self-employed.  MSAs inject choice and accountability into the health-care system, and 100 percent deductibility places all businesses on an equal plain in terms of the tax treatment of health care expenses.
<p>
<li> Estate tax reductions.  The estate tax amount to nothing more than a government hostile takeover of family businesses.  All cuts in the estate tax are welcome, hopefully on the path to complete repeal of the estate tax.
<p>
<li> Repeal of the 1993 tax increase on Social Security beneficiaries.  Again, this will boost incentives to work and keep resources in the private sector.
<li> Expanded IRAs and institution of spousal IRAs.  Such measures will boost incentives to save and expand loanable funds available to business.
<p>
<li> Regulatory reform.  Requiring peer-reviewed, science-based risk assessment and cost benefit analysis for new regulations, regulatory review of all new regulations every four years, and a task force to review and recommend sunsetting ineffective and costly regulations, all point toward gaining some much-needed control over a federal regulatory apparatus strangling businesses, investment, and entrepreneurship.
<p>
<li>Legal reform.  Measures such as limiting punitive damages in most cases, abolishing joint and several liability for non-economic damages in civil cases, and curbing contingency fee abuses, all amount to a good start at alleviating many of the burdensome costs of our legal system that damage or destroy countless businesses and the jobs they create.
</ul>
<p>
</ul>
<dd>U.S. businesses and entrepreneurs need tax cuts, regulatory relief, and legal reform.  The cost of government is massive, inhibiting new business formation, economic growth, and job creation.  Once fully implemented, the proposals in the Dole economic plan would: 
<ul>
<li> Increase incentives for working, saving, investing, and entrepreneurship.
<p>
<li> Boost rates of economic growth and job creation.
<p>
<li> Help both equity and bond markets, as incentives for investment are enhanced and faster economic growth eases inflation threats (assuming sound monetary policy).  After all, inflation results from too much money chasing too few goods -- faster growth means more goods and services.
</ul>
<p>
<dd>The bottom line is: Tax cuts help small businesses and entrepreneurs.

<center><i>November 1995</i><hr>
<h3>Improving the Flat Tax</h3> <P>
<b>by Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee</b></center><P>	
<hr>
<P>
It is encouraging to see that significant proposals for overhauling the U.S. tax system are actually under serious consideration today, not only in the many think tanks that sprinkle Washington, D.C.'s urban landscape, but in the halls of Congress and on the presidential campaign trail.  In a couple of years, our federal tax code may shed thousands of pages and actually make sense to all Americans.  Indeed, the income tax as we now know it may no longer exist.	Tax Principles.  In a recent Small Business Survival Foundation booklet, "The Great Tax Debate: Making Sense of Competing Tax Plans," our current tax system and a variety of proposed substitutes were analyzed and scored.  Each system was evaluated according to a set of principles for sound taxation: <P>
<ul>
<LI> maintain a low, flat tax rate to limit economic distortions and promote growth; <LI> cease taxing returns on capital, particularly capital gains, in order to eliminate double taxation and spur entrepreneurship and investment -- the economy's lifeblood; 
<LI> create no tax-based 
incentives for government to inflate the currency; 
<LI> clarity -- taxes and who pays them should be obvious; <LI> paying taxes should be as simple as possible for the taxpayer; 
<LI> the tax-gathering bureaucracy should be limited in both size and powers; 
<LI> incentives for tax avoidance should be minimized; 
<LI> and finally, a tax system 
should not make it any easier for government to increase expenditures.	
</ul><P>
<b>Flat Tax and Retail Sales Tax Score Best</b><P>
  According to these criteria, the flat tax and national retail sales tax score best, followed at quite a distance by the value-added tax, the consumed-income tax, and our current mess of a tax code.  Of the top two proposals, the flat tax carries the most significant political support at this time.<P>
<b>Armey Plan</b><P>
  As currently proposed by U.S. House of Representatives Majority Leader Dick Armey, a flat tax would impose a 17 percent rate on both personal and business income.  For individuals, capital gains, dividends, and interest income would not be taxed, having already been captured at the business level.  Personal allowances could be deducted at $21,400 for a couple, and $5,000 for each dependent.  Therefore, a family of four would not pay any tax on earnings up to $31,400.	For business, the 17 percent tax rate would apply to gross revenues minus purchases of goods and services, capital equipment, structures, land, and wages paid to employees.  Deductions would not be allowed for fringe benefits, interest paid, or payments to owners.	Such a plan would simplify greatly how individuals and businesses pay taxes.  <P>Reducing the top tax rate to 17 percent boosts incentives for work and risk taking.  An absence of taxation on individual capital gains, dividend, and interest income, and expensing of capital goods by business, will spur entrepreneurship and investment. <P>
 	A great threat to the beauty and efficiency of the flat tax remains politicians' incessant desire to serve special interests by tinkering with the tax code -- creating loopholes and raising rates.   The current Armey plan would counter such tendencies by requiring a three-fifths super-majority congressional vote in order to raise taxes.  <P>
<b>	Three Steps to a Better Flat Tax</b><P>
  As good as this plan is, however, room for improvement on the flat tax exists.  Three steps would place the flat tax on firmer economic ground -- in greater compliance with the aforementioned principles of sound taxation -- though albeit on more radical political terrain.  However, aren't Republicans telling us we are in the midst of a political revolution?  	<P>
First, the original Armey flat tax plan called for the end of individual income tax withholding, which had begun as a wartime measure during World War II.  <P>

Ending withholding would drive home the true cost of government to the taxpayer.  Instead of having taxes withdrawn before receiving one's paycheck, taxpayers would receive their full pay and then have to write out a check to the federal government for income taxes  on a monthly or quarterly basis.  Individuals would gain a much clearer picture of how much government costs.  In its most recent manifestation, though, the Armey plan no longer proposes an end to withholding.  This much-needed reform should be reinstated.	<P>

Second, tax reformers should stop worshiping the idol of "revenue neutrality."  A desire for revenue-neutral tax reform already forced Rep. Armey to reduce his proposed personal allowances and deductions.  Taxpayers and the U.S. economy need both a sound tax system and lower taxes.  Setting a goal of revenue neutrality means that one tacitly accepts that current levels of government spending and taxation are just right, a dubious proposition to say the least.<P>

In 1995, the federal government will spend $1.54 trillion.  Rather than accepting as inevitable a relentless climb to $2 trillion -- as both Democrats and Republicans seemingly have done -- the goal should be to reduce spending -- descending to the $1 trillion mark.  <P>

Room for downsizing government is substantial and the need for tax reduction paramount.  	<P>
Third, it remains in dispute as to who bears the ultimate burden when it comes to paying business income taxes -- owners, employees, consumers, or some combination of these individuals?  No matter how the burden shakes out, business income taxes remain hidden from the view of those who pay them.  Clarity dictates that taxing income at the business level should be terminated, with dividends taxed, if at all, at the individual level.	Smaller Government and a Flat Tax.  Tax overhaul needs to be part of a comprehensive effort to ease governmental burdens.  Government spending has to be cut substantially.  Income at the business level, capital gains, and interest earned should not be taxed at all.  And the tax rate on all remaining income -- wages, salaries, and dividends -- needs to be as low as possible.  Throughout history, until the early-to-mid twentieth century, a levy of 10 percent was always considered a heavy tax.  A ten percent flat tax on wages, salaries and dividends, with no deductions, would still allow the federal government to collect more than $300 billion in income taxes, conservatively estimated, not to mention revenues from the social security payroll tax.	What would result from this even more revolutionary version of the flat tax?  <P>Entrepreneurship, investment, economic growth, and job creation would be driven to heights that in recent high-tax-rate decades were considered unimaginable.<P><P><center>[ <a href="/sbsc/home.html>SBSC Home</a> | <a href="/sbsc/i-tax.html">Tax Watch Index</a> ]</center></body></html>

<h3>Who Will Be Tax Reform's "Braveheart"?</h3> 
<b>by Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>
The need to overhaul our tax code has long been apparent, but the necessary political courage was always in short supply.  However, a historic transformation may be under way in Congress as tax overhaul now receives serious consideration.  	As portrayed in Mel Gibson's movie "Braveheart," William Wallace laid the groundwork for Robert the Bruce to gain Scotland's independence from England in the late 13th and early 14th centuries.  One might say that House Majority Leader Dick Armey and House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer are vying for the role of William Wallace on the matter of tax reform, hoping that their own Robert the Bruce will be elected president in 1996 leading to independence from the many burdens of our current income tax structure.
<p><b>	Can an Income Tax Be Benign?</b>
<P>  As constituted today, the federal income tax system is a mess.  It is punitive, complicated, inefficient, intrusive, and serves as an impediment to entrepreneurship, investment, economic growth, and job creation.  Interestingly however, when initially imposed, the federal income tax appeared rather straightforward and not all that burdensome -- almost benign.  Of course, appearances can be deceiving.
<p>
<b>Original Personal Income Tax</b>  
<P>
As originally proposed, the income tax was meant to impose a very low level of tax rates on only the very highest levels of income.  The 16th amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowing for an income tax eventually won approval because proponents argued that it was a way to force the so-called "robber barons" to pay taxes.  The income tax was not supposed to be a mechanism for reaching into the pockets of most Americans.
<p>
	Figures 1 and 2 illustrate this point quite clearly.  <a href="#1">Figure 1</a> shows the personal income tax structure as initially imposed in 1913, while <a href="#2">Figure 2</a> illustrates what this tax system would look like in 1994 dollars.
<p>
	Undoubtedly, the income tax was not meant to be paid by most citizens, nor were rates so high as to significantly undermine the spirit of enterprise.  For example, if the original income tax system had been left in effect and indexed for inflation, today single taxpayers would pay no tax on any earnings up to almost $45,000 and married couples on earnings up to almost $60,000.  A 1 percent tax rate would be in effect on incomes up to about $300,000.  The top rate of 7 percent would not take hold until earnings of almost $7.5 million.
<p>
<b>Original Corporate Income Tax</b>
<P>
  As for the corporate income 
tax, it was imposed in 1909 at a rate of 1 percent and a $5,000 exemption.  Again, translated into 1994 dollars, corporate income would face the 1 percent rate with an exemption of $81,967.
<p>
<b>Envy = Bad Economics</b>
<P>
  The income tax was an attempt to finance the expansion of government through an appeal to envy.  Envy, though, tends to know no boundaries, and never makes for good economic policy.  The income tax was transformed rather quickly from a light tax on very high incomes to a heavy tax on almost all levels of income.  Naturally, tax avoidance among upper-income individuals -- the ultimate targets of the income tax -- increased along with rising tax rates.
<p>
	As the U.S. undertakes a historic debate over its tax system in the coming months and years, it must be remembered at all times that the income tax remains a dangerous levy.  It raises the costs of working, saving, investing, and risk taking, thereby restraining economic growth.  
<p>
<b>A Boost to Government Spending</b>
<P>
  The income tax also acts as high-octane fuel for the growth of government spending.  Under the income-tax regime, between 1913 and 1994, inflation-adjusted federal government expenditures increased by 13,592 percent!  Over this same period, personal and corporate income taxes grew from 7 percent of total federal revenues and 0.1 percent of the economy, to more than 54 percent of total federal revenues and over 10 percent of U.S. GDP.	
<P>
<b>No Income Tax Led to High Growth</b>
<P>
  As the nineteenth century came to a close and the twentieth century dawned, the United States government imposed no income taxes on its citizens.  It was a period when America took great strides in becoming the world's most powerful economy.  Entrepreneurs pushed the economy to astounding rates of economic growth.  In fact, from 1870 to 1913 -- from when it was agreed that the Civil War income tax would end until the income tax was re-imposed -- the U.S. economy expanded by over 435 percent in real terms, or by an average rate of more than 10 percent per year -- with no inflation.	
<P>
<b>Reforms for the 21st Century</b>
<P>
  As the twentieth century comes to a close and we look toward the twenty-first century, many are concerned with America's economic vitality in an increasingly competitive world economy.  Surely, we must considerably downsize government, deregulate our economy, and re-link the dollar to gold to ensure greater price stability.
<p>
	Perhaps most important, though, we should replace our current tax system with a low, flat tax -- bringing us closer to the original intent of the income tax.  To some degree, this is Representative Armey's suggestion -- his bid, if you will, to be the William Wallace of tax reform.  In contrast, some say simply put an end to one of the twentieth century's biggest impediments to entrepreneurship and growth - the income tax -- and replace it with a direct consumption tax, such as a national retail sales tax.  This is Representative Archer's claim to being a Wallace-like tax reformer.	As long as rates are kept low, the resulting entrepreneurial boom from either plan will stagger even the most wild-eyed optimists and launch the U.S. economy into the twenty-first century.  Of course, as to who will play the role of Robert the Bruce, and actually implement a massive tax revolution, remains to be determined in November 1996.
<p>
<b>Guarding Against Losing Tax Independence</b>
<P>
  One needs to remember, though, that after William Wallace and Robert the Bruce, Scotland eventually lost its independence.  Tax reformers face a similar, ominous threat to their long-run success.  Specifically, flat tax proponents must guard against future presidents and members of Congress merely raising tax rates after most all deductions have been eliminated.  The only way to guard against such backsliding is to require a super-majority vote of the Congress in order to raise taxes.  
<p>
	Retail-sales-tax advocates, of course, must ensure that an 
income tax is not re-imposed at some point down the road.  They must repeal the 16th amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowing for an income tax.	
<p>
Today, the flat tax holds the upper hand politically, and is well worth fighting to implement.  A flat tax rate of 17 percent (preferably even lower), with no taxation of capital gains, interest earned, and dividends, would boost significantly crucial incentives to work, save, invest, and take risks.  	
<p>
In the long run, however, given the destructive nature and history of the income tax, economic freedom and independence for entrepreneurs and all citizens may only be guaranteed by eliminating the income tax, to be "replaced" by government spending cuts and a low retail sales levy of less than 10 percent.  Such a "dream" tax code, though, is not yet in the cards.  Today's revolution is not quite that revolutionary.

<h3>Stay Bullish - Cut & Index the Capital Gains Tax</h3> 
<b>by Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>
Since the Republicans seized control of Congress in the November 1994 elections, stock prices have been positively buoyant.  Indeed, between November 4, 1994 -- the Friday before election day -- to September 20, 1995, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 3807.52 to 4792.69 -- up over 25 percent.  The broader S&P 500 Index climbed from 462.28 to 586.77 -- up almost 27 percent.  The Nasdaq Composite  jumped from 766.08 to 1065.09 -- up almost 39 percent.	
<p>
One may be tempted to call this a Republican bull market.  In fact, that may be the case.  However, it is not party affiliation that matters, but the policies being pursued by those in elected (e.g., Congress and the President) and appointed (e.g., the Federal Reserve) offices.  The Republicans rode into Congress last November promising deregulation, smaller government, elimination of the budget deficit, and tax cuts.  While this combined package has no doubt influenced stock prices, maximum impact springs from the proposal to cut the capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 19.8 percent and index capital gains for inflation.  It's basic Adam Smith economics -- higher potential profits attract investors.	
<p>
<b>Can't Afford Any Backsliding on Capital Gains.</b>  
<p>
Some faltering in the new Congress' "revolutionary" agenda can be detected.  Instead of eliminating four cabinet level departments as originally envisioned, a massive struggle is underway to eliminate just the Commerce Department.  Funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and PBS lingers.  Indeed, overall federal government spending will continue to rise.  Much-needed reform of how the federal government regulates the private sector is stalled.  Repeal of the blatantly racist and costly Davis-Bacon Act is in serious doubt.  Such shortcomings will take a toll on the economy as well as on Republican political capital.  However, an inability to cut and index the capital gains tax would be the most damaging blow to entrepreneurship, investment and the economy.	
<p>
As the old saying goes, if you want less of something, tax it.  Investors have been counting on a lower, indexed capital gains tax since late last year.  This anticipation explains a good portion of the rise in stock prices during this period.  Failure to deliver on such a pro-entrepreneur tax cut would amount to a sharp blow to capital markets.  In particular, start-up and high-growth, high-tech enterprises would feel the most pain.  In the event of a failure to cut and index the capital gains tax, potential returns on such high-risk endeavors would be reduced and, therefore, so would equity prices.  The amount of capital available for investment would be far less under a higher, non-indexed capital gains tax rate -- indeed, by various estimates, trillions of dollars less.	
<p>
<b>Main Street vs. Wall Street?</b>  
<p>
Of course, opponents paint capital gains tax reduction as a rich-vs.-poor issue, or even as "Wall Street" vs. "Main Street."  Such a confrontation is mythical.  When the successful Main Street entrepreneur with a good idea needs capital to expand and create more jobs, he seeks out investors.  To do so, he often goes to Wall Street.  A lower, indexed capital gains tax -- that is, a higher potential return on capital -- makes it far easier to attract investors.	
<p>
What hurts Wall Street, hurts Main Street, and vice versa.  And of course, what helps one also helps the other.  The best way for federal officials to help would be the complete elimination of capital gains taxes.  Short of such a sound economic policy initiative, reducing the top capital gains tax rate to 19.8 percent and indexing for inflation will do quite nicely for now.	
<p>
<b>Again, the Importance of Retroactive Indexing.</b>  
<p>
As for indexing, its importance cannot be stressed enough.  This has been noted in previous SBSC publications.  The Senate is wavering on indexation.  The House has called only for prospective indexing (calculated from January 1, 1995) on assets held for at least three years.  To make sure that the real capital gains tax rate does not rise above 19.8 percent, that trillions of dollars are unlocked for new investment, and that resources find their way to their best uses, retroactive indexing must be passed and the three-year time limit for indexation eliminated.  	
<p>
The most pro-growth, pro-entrepreneur step this Congress could possibly muster this year is real, significant capital gains tax relief.  It also happens to be a good avenue for keeping a bull market chugging along.

<h3>First Step Toward Budget Sanity:<br> Eliminate the Commerce Department</h3> 
<b>by Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>

In fiscal year 1995, the U.S. federal government will spend an 
estimated $1.52 trillion.  By the year 2000, President Clinton's budget would see total outlays reach $1.91 trillion.  Even the more frugal House of Representatives Concurrent Resolution on the Budget -- Fiscal Year 1996 calls for spending to rise to $1.78 trillion by 2000.
<p>
This seemingly relentless march toward a $2-trillion federal budget 
needs to be halted.  The United States should be moving in the opposite direction -- downsizing the public sector and freeing up resources for productive, private-sector ventures.  A public-sector retreat -- making room for substantial tax cuts -- will allow the private sector and entrepreneurship to advance.  Real spending reduction means reversing course toward a $1-trillion federal government.
<p>
  Despite the cries from big-government and special-interest circles, much can be cut from the U.S. federal budget.  The Department of Energy, Department of Education, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Transportation, the Small Business Administration, bloated welfare programs, and so many other areas of federal largess offer fertile ground for savings opportunities through considerable downsizing or outright elimination.  As the first major step, perhaps no other department deserves to be dismantled more than the U.S. Department of Commerce.
<p>
<b>The Grand Delusion</b>
<P>
Supporters of the Commerce Department, most prominently Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, claim that the department serves taxpayers and the economy well by increasing U.S. exports, seeding new technologies, and boosting economic growth.  Secretary Brown recently declared: "The work of this department is essential to the economic growth and well-being of this country."1  The Secretary even asserted at the White House Conference on Small Business on June 13, 1995 that the Commerce Department leveraged a "$250 million export promotion budget into $25 billion in overseas sales."  He also declared that an end to the Department's Manufacturing Extension Project would leave "America's 380,000 small manufacturers, with nearly twelve million employees, without accessible and supportive local extension programs providing up-to-date strategies and technologies."  
<P>
Such declarations are, to say the least, most difficult to believe.  After all, if America's small manufacturers relied on a government program for "up-to-date strategies and technologies" and exporters depended on Commerce bureaucrats to sell their wares, our economy today would be a third-world basketcase.  Brown and other Commerce Department proponents fall prey to the grand delusion of industrial policy.  
<P>
In reality, government does not possess the proper knowledge and incentives to be picking industry winners and losers; nor should taxpayer dollars be placed at risk in such futile endeavors.  As for expanding U.S. exports, a productive role for the government is limited to lowering trade barriers.  The Commerce Department should not be acting as the international marketing department for certain American businesses, with taxpayers, including other businesses, footing the bill.  And in terms of boosting economic growth, the economy would be far better served if taxes were cut -- boosting incentives to work, invest, and take risks -- and the Commerce Department terminated.  In the end, individuals buying, selling, creating, and investing in the marketplace always work better than government bureaucrats pushing paper and spending taxpayer dollars.
<P>
In addition to its bankrupt industrial-policy mission, the Commerce Department also serves as a "catch all" federal department.  It houses large governmental undertakings that have absolutely nothing to do with "commerce," such as the Bureau of the Census and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
<P>
<b>Commerce Budget</b>  
<P>
The taxpayers' price tag for the Commerce Department is by no means cheap.  Federal outlays for the Commerce Department in 1995 are estimated at $3.6 billion.  Figure 1 shows Commerce Department outlays since 1980 and Clinton Administration estimates for 1995 through 2000.
<P>
<b>Dismantling the Commerce Department</b>  
<P>
The U.S. Department of Commerce 
offers a clear opportunity to save taxpayer dollars.  The Commerce Department should be closed, with most of its duties terminated or privatized, and the remaining moved to other departments.  
<ul>
<li> The Bureau of the Census and all other economic and statistical analysis functions at the Commerce Department, at the very least, should be moved into an independent statistical agency, along with other statistical and data-collection functions undertaken by the federal government.  
<p>
However, Jim Miller, former budget director under President Ronald Reagan, offers an intriguing alternative for the Bureau of the Census.  He notes that while the Constitution requires a population census every 10 years, it does not say a government agency has to perform it.  Why not contract it out to a private firm?2  
<p>
<li> All economic development, travel and tourism, and technology programs should be privatized if possible, or otherwise terminated, including the Economic Development Administration, the Minority Business Development Agency, the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration,  Technology Administration, the National Technical Information Service, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the National Telecommunications and Information Agency.
<p>
<li> End the federal government's roles as international marketing department for multinational firms, and a center for raising protectionist trade barriers against foreign goods.  The International Trade Administration should be closed.
<p>
<li> Legitimate trade activities -- such as negotiating, implementing, and enforcing free-trade accords -- should be moved to the Treasury Department.  The Bureau of Export Administration, though, with its responsibility for overseeing the export of goods that could impact national security, should be moved to the Department of Defense.
<p>
<li> The Patent and Trademark Office should be shifted to the Justice Department.
<p>
<li> As for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), much of this $2-billion behemoth should be privatized, with remaining duties shifted to other departments.  For example, the largest part of the NOAA's budget goes toward the National Weather Service.  Heritage Foundation economist Joe Cobb reports that roughly 300 private companies prepare and disseminate weather forecasts, with 85 percent of the American public receiving its weather forecasts from private meteorologists and for-profit companies.  The opportunity for substantial privatization is at hand.
</ul><P>
<p>
<b>A Revolution Needs Real Commitment.</b>  
<p>
The Republican Congress is sending out mixed signals on the Commerce Department.  Some only want to cut the Commerce budget, but leave the department in tact.  Others want to replace the Commerce Department with another, smaller cabinet-level agency, such as a Department of International Trade.  These half-measures should be abandoned.  
<p>
If our federal elected officials are serious about downsizing government, then the Commerce Department truly must be eliminated.  An inability to make the easy cuts -- like eliminating Commerce -- would bode ill for the more politically difficult, but clearly necessary cuts down the road.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Majority Leader Dick Armey issued a statement on July 26 declaring their "firm commitment to incorporate the [Commerce Department] dismantling legislation into the reconciliation bill."3  
<p>
This commitment to eliminate Commerce needs to be unequivocal if we are ever to bring some sanity back to the U.S. federal budget.  Otherwise, failure to kill the Department of Commerce would signal severe weakness and perhaps the end of a shortlived revolution.  <P><hr>

<h3>Clinton's Budding Trade War or Pacific Rim Free Trade?</h3> 
<b>by Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>
"The consumer is king."  This concept underlies the free enterprise system. While entrepreneurs drive the economy with their new ideas, innovations, products and services, they ultimately must submit their wares to the tests of the marketplace.  The entrepreneur must meet current consumer demands, create new demands, or fail trying.   	<p>
Of course, the consumer reaps enormous benefits.  Competition among producers lowers prices, expands choices, and enhances quality.  International suppliers of goods and services are a major factor in this process, providing greater competition.  This fact probably never has been so clearly illustrated than in the automobile industry.  In essence, the U.S. automobile industry was saved by foreign competition.  As cost and quality suffered in the 1970s and early 1980s, American consumers could look elsewhere for their transportation needs -- foreign automobile companies.  Naturally, U.S. consumers would have reaped even greater rewards had the government not imposed various trade barriers.  However, even somewhat limited competition forced American automobile producers to improve their products -- to meet the needs of the consumer.	Unfortunately, President Bill Clinton and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Cantor seem ready to overthrow the  consumer as king, replacing him with managed-trade bureaucrats.  The looming threat of 100 percent tariffs on Japanese luxury car imports makes no economic sense.	<p>

Most absurd, the Clinton Administration wants the Japanese government to essentially guarantee market share for U.S. auto parts firms.  Imagine the fury in this nation, if the Japanese pressured the U.S. government to force private businesses to buy a certain amount of Japanese products.  To complete this strange scenario, the proposed 100 percent tariff on 13 Japanese luxury cars would be retroactive to May 20.  Retroactive taxes seem to be a favorite of this Administration -- the 1993 income tax hike was retroactive as well.<p>

A Tax Increase With All the Accompanying Evils.  One needs to remember that a tariff is a tax.  Consumers of Japanese luxury automobiles will face a 100 percent tax on their purchases, if President Clinton carries through with his tariff threat.  The end result of such an act would be to eliminate such vehicles from the U.S. marketplace -- limiting competition and consumer choices.	<p>

The Administration once again is playing the class warfare card, as it did with its 1993 tax increase.  After all, some people say so what if some wealthy individuals will have to either pay a exorbitant tax or consider purchasing a non-Japanese luxury car.  Of course, we all have heard such faulty reasoning before -- such as with the 1990 federal budget deal, which included a luxury tax on yachts.  Of course, the rich were not soaked, but the businesses and the employees who built the boats were devastated.  If the Clinton tax increase on Japanese luxury cars goes into effect on June 28, the hardest impact will be felt by U.S. importers, car dealers, and their employees.	<p>

Indeed, tens of thousands of jobs would be placed in jeopardy.  As 
reported by The Washington Times, 8,000 Americans work in Lexus dealerships and 10,000 in Acura dealerships.  In addition to Lexus and Acura models, Mitsubishi, Mazda, and Infiniti models would fall prey to Clinton's tariffs.  If implemented, these tariffs would be a clear instance where higher taxes closed businesses and placed individuals on the unemployment lines.  The Japanese import car industry asserts that as many as 81,000 jobs would be placed at risk.	An even wider threat looms for the U.S. economy, i.e., Japanese retaliation against U.S. exports.  Japan is the United States' second largest trading partner.  As we all supposedly learned from the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, protectionism hurts everyone in the end.<p>

<b>A Matter of Opening or Serving the Japanese Market?</b><P>
  While most Americans assume that the Japanese market is shut as tight as a clam -- especially in the area of automobiles -- this issue actually remains open to question.  For example, the U.S. may have a point regarding restrictions pertaining to access to Japanese car dealerships.  However, U.S. automakers have never been aggressive in establishing their own dealer networks in Japan.<P>

	More important is the question of supplying autos the Japanese want to drive.  As noted earlier, in order to succeed, a business must meet current or create new consumer demands.  U.S. critics of Japanese trade policies often resort to market share arguments.  That is, since U.S. automakers have captured such small market share in Japan (about 1.6 percent of the new-car market and 1.4 percent of the auto-parts market, according to Investor's Business Daily, June 16, 1995), severe trade barriers must exist.  However, other forces are clearly at work.

<P>For example, the Japanese drive on the left side of the road, 
as a result Japanese consumers are partial (obviously) to right-hand-drive vehicles.  The Economist reported in its June 17, 1995 issue that only two American car models -- in a total of three versions -- come with right-hand drive in Japan.  Meanwhile, the number of models of left-hand-drive Japanese cars in America equals 68, available in a total of 179 different versions.  One easily could conclude that U.S. automakers need to work much harder to meet the demands of Japanese consumers.<p>

<b>"Drop Your Gun, or I'll Shoot!"</b><P>

  Even if we assume that trade barriers remain the largest obstacle to U.S. autos and auto parts in Japan, why punish U.S. consumers?  Whenever a politician threatens to impose retaliatory tariffs on imports, I am reminded of those movie scenes where a character grabs an innocent bystander during a gunfight, puts a gun to that person's head, and yells to his opponent, "Drop your gun, or I'll shoot!"	 <p>

During trade wars, the innocent bystanders with economic guns pointed at their heads are consumers.  Just because the Japanese government may be treating their consumers rather shabbily is no excuse for the U.S. government to treat its consumers the same way.  The U.S. already imposes myriad tariffs and quotas that cost consumers billions of dollars annually.  Indeed, the U.S. is not exactly friendly to many Japanese auto imports, imposing quotas and a 25-percent tariff on imported trucks.  Rather than increasing such penalties, the U.S. should be lowering barriers to trade.<P>

<b>Free Trade on the Pacific Rim</b><P>
  Trade seemed to be the one area of the economy where President Clinton showed some leadership and economic understanding.  Though not perfect, NAFTA and GATT were major steps in the right direction.  Rather than issuing threats, raising trade barriers, circumventing the World Trade Organization (which Clinton helped establish to settle trade disputes), and perhaps creeping toward a full-scale trade war, President Clinton should reassert his leadership on the world scene as an advocate of free trade, and push for a Pacific Rim free trade agreement.  	<P>

The President certainly has struggled on the foreign policy front, including such hotbeds as Somalia, Bosnia and Chechnya.  Not to mention that after pushing for NAFTA, his administration helped to devastate Mexico's economy by assisting the Mexican government with its wrongheaded peso devaluation and bungled policies thereafter.  The President may believe that there are political points to be scored by taking on Japan.  <P>

However, any benefits will be shortlived since his actions are so transparent.  Indeed, The New York Times observed on its editorial page (May 18, 1995) in reference to the President's threatened tariffs on Japanese luxury cars: "It seems designed more to mend the President's relations with American unions than to resolve trade differences with Japan."  <P>

Reasserting U.S. commitment to free trade -- by example rather than by threats -- would bolster the U.S. internationally.<P>

	A free trade initiative for the Pacific Rim would change the course of American-Japanese trade negotiations -- moving away from the threat of a trade war and toward a freer, growing international marketplace.  The President has mentioned support for such an initiative in the past, but now seems to be going off in a far different, economically dangerous direction.  For the sake of the economy, he needs to get back on the free-trade track, and a Pacific Rim initiative makes particular sense at this time.  	<P>

Unfortunately, if Clinton fails to move in this direction, there are 
few signals emanating from Republicans in Congress to indicate that they understand the issue much better.  Indeed, Republicans have been eerily silent in regards to the President's threats against Japan and, effectively, against U.S. consumers.  Indeed, some Republicans have voiced support.<P>

<b>Free Trade: Providing Opportunities for America's Entrepreneurs</b>
<P>
  A recent article in Investor's Business Daily noted that the Japanese were coming to the United States to study entrepreneurship.  A Pacific Rim free trade agreement would grant them first-hand experience.  Tearing down trade barriers around the Pacific would create enormous opportunities for American business and entrepreneurs; consumers would reap great rewards; and economic growth would receive a hearty boost.<P>

	U.S. consumers, as well as businesses and employees working in the U.S. import industry, should not be sacrificed to misguided, politically driven trade policies.  Free trade works best, and the U.S. should reclaim global leadership on this issue.

<title>Capital Gains and the U.S. Senate</title>

May 1995<p>

<h2>Capital Gains and the U.S. Senate</h2>
by Raymond J. Keating 
Chief Economist 
Small Business Survival Committee
</center><p>
<hr>
 
<i>"Upward mobility is what America is all about, and the ability to access and accumulate capital -- an ability undermined by the capital gainst tax -- is the stairway by which people move up."</i><p>
<p>
--Jack Kemp, The Washington Time, 5/2/95<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>"Experience indicates that lower capital gains taxes have a positive impace on federal revenues.  The most 
impressive evidence involves the period from 1978 to 1985.  During those years the marginal federal tax 
rate on capital gains was cut from almost 50 percent to 20 percent -- but total individual capital gains tax 
receipts increased from $9.1 billion to $26.5 billion."</i><p>
<p>
--American Council for Capital Formation, January 1995<p>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
	In 1989, then-Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D-ME) single-handedly killed a capital gains tax cut.  Mitchell's dedication to class warfare and blind-eye towards the benefits for all capital -- income levels from capital gains tax reduction cost the economy untold growth and opportunity -- businesses that were never created or expanded, new jobs never added to the economy, and products and services never made available to consumers.<p>

	President George Bush refused to make another serious push for capital gains tax reduction.  
Indeed, he sacrificed his no-new-taxes pledge and ultimately his presidency the following year by signing 
on to a deficit reduction package that raised taxes, failed to actually cut spending, and didn't reduce the 
deficit.<p>

	Today we have a new Congress looking to do buisness in a new way.  the House of 
Representatives has passed a tax cut package -- including capital gains tax rate reduction (top rate of 19.8 percent for individuals and 25 percent for corporations) and indexing gains for inflation.  Indexing capital gains and reducing the capital gains tax rate was by far the most pro-growth plank in the House 
Republicans' "Contract with America."  For the small buisness, entrepreneurial sector of the economy, 
capital gains tax reduction means greater access to capital for investment and growth.  If America truly has a new Senate in 1995, then the mistakes of 1989 will not be repeated and capital gains tax reduction will be enacted.<p>

<b>Tax Cuts for Growth and Spending Cuts for Deficit Reduction</b> However, some Senators seem to be unable to grasp the concept that cutting taxes and reducing the deficit can be achieved simultaneously.  Many claim such actions to be contradictory.  They are not.  The supply-side economics concept of "policy levers" can help to make this clearer.<p>

	Briefly, the policy lever concept states that policies should directed at the area of the economy where they hold a comparative advantage.  For example, the lone goal of monetary policy, or the monetary lever, should be to achieve price stability.  Meanwhile, the fiscal lever should be geared toward promoting economic growth by enhancing incentives for working, saving, investing, and entrepreneurship.  Misunderstanding how the economy works, old-line Keynesian economists claim that such actions are contradictory.  Yet, tight money and tax cuts in the 1980s cured stagflation and placed the U.S. economy on a robust growth path.<p>
 
	Likewise, the concept of policy levers can help us with the current dilemma regarding tax cuts and the deficit.  As noted, the fiscal lever should be positioned to promote growth.  Therefore, reducing capital gains tax rates and indexing returns for inflation makes sense -- i.e., the tax lever should be moved in a pro-growth direction.  Meanwhile, the spending lever should then be adjusted so as to deal with the deficit.  Quite simply, if the fiscal lever is going to promote economic growth, then taxes must be cut and deficits dealt with through spending cuts.<p>
 
	Tax increases only work to slow economic growth, thereby boosting government spending, 
shrinking the tax base, and actually expanding the deficit.  Meanwhile, pro-growth tax cuts along with 
spending restraint amount to the most sensible fiscal policy -- the combination of a growing economy, an expanding tax base, and prudent spending policies will shrink the deficit.<p>
 
	Tax cuts and deficit reduction do not have to be mutually exclusive.  The formula for sound fiscal policy is clear: tax cuts for economic growth and spending cuts for deficit reduction.<p>
 
<b>Boosting Entrepreneurship.</b>  Make no mistake, shifting tax policy into a growth mode through capital gains tax rate reduction and indexing, while reducing government spending, will serve to boost the small business, entrepreneurial sector of the economy -- where job creation occurs.  Indeed, considering that access to capital remains probably the biggest obstacle for small business and entrepreneurs, it is difficult to think of a more damaging levy to small business than the capital gains tax.  Entrepreneurs need capital to start up new businesses, to expand existing enterprises, and to create jobs.</p>
 
	<i>In effect, capital gains tax reduction is the best "jobs program" government can institute.</i>
 
	If the Senate wants to ensure that entrepreneurs gain access to capital, then it will:  
 
<ul>

<li>Reduce the top capital gains tax rate to 19.8 percent on individuals, as the House did (the 
corporate rate on capital gains would drop to 25 percent); 

<li>Index gains for inflation.  Unfortunately, the House tax cut only allows for indexing from the 
beginning of 1995, no matter when the asset was acquired.  The Senate should provide for full indexing for inflation from the time the asset actually was acquired, and insist on this in joint conference with the 
House.  Full indexing would unlock trillions of dollars of capital for investment in new and expanding 
businesses.
</ul>
<p>
	In the end, however, Congress should shift the fiscal policy lever into full growth mode by 
eliminating capital gains taxes altogether.<p>

<h2>Stop Government Hostile Takeovers of</h2>
<h2>Family Businesses: Repeal the Estate Tax</h2>
</center>

<hr>
<i>"Interestingly, for a tax that is supposed to inflict such little pain, people have devoted a great deal of ingenuit to getting around [the estate tax]."</i><p>

-- Economist Bruce Bartlett in his book  Reaganomics<p>


<i>"The U.S. is virtually the only country in the world that imposes significant income and death taxes on the worldwide income and assets of every citizen, even if the citizen is domiciled elsewhere."</i><p>

--Robert Lenzner and Phillippe Mao, "The New Refugees," Forbes 11/221/94<p>


<i>"It's basically cheaper to give away a business than to die owning it."</i><p>

--Frank Rainaldi quoted Investor's Buisness Daily, 4/12/95<p>
<hr>

	At various points in the history of modern-day capitalism, concerns have been raised regarding hostile takeovers of business entities.  Worries over general corporate instability, excessive debt, and job losses often arise when an individual or firm attempts seize the reins of a corporation against the wishes of current management.  In fact, though, hostile takeovers remain a source of dynamism in a free enterprise system -- often removing moribund, inefficient management, finding ways to add value and increase production, and boosting the economy.<p>

	<i>One kind of hostile takeover distinctly anti-free enterprise, though, and worthy of harsh criticism is the federal estate tax, along with the gift and generation-skipping taxes.</i>  After working hard, paying taxes, and establishing a business over a lifetime, thegovernment moves in to claim up to 60 percent of an individual's assets upon death -- a hostile takeover, if you will.  And a target for government raiders under the guise of the estate tax are family businesses.<p>

<b>Insurance to Pay Taxes.</b>  To fend off such government takeovers, family business owners channel large amounts of resources into relatively unproductive endeavors in order to pass business on to the next generation.  Legions of accountants explore creative ways to shield assets from death taxes.  Indeed, individuals may purchase life insurance for the sole purpose of paying estate taxes. Insurance is not cheap, however, and remains out of reach for many individuals working hard to keep their businesses afloat, or if purchased, diverts resources away from productive investment.  A clear indication of a tax system gone awry is when insurance is being bought to cover the costs of taxation.<p>

<b>Killing Businesses.</b>  Most often, the need to pay estate taxes winds up killing family-owned businesses.  In fact, 60 percent of family-owned businesses fail to make it to the second generation, and 90 percent do not make it to the third generation.<a href="#foot1">1</a>  Estate taxes in play a significant role in this development.  Perhaps most detrimental is the fact that the government is stripping a company of much-needed capital at the worst possible juncture -- under a change of ownership and oversight. Most businesses simply never recover.<p>

	Heavy estate taxation also acts as a disincentive for investment and entrepreneurship, just as onerous income and capital gains taxes do.  With 55 percent of a business enterprise essentially slated for a government takeover, there remains little incentive for individuals to continue to invest and expand a family business when the owner reaches a certain age.  Rather, business owners possess every incentive to sell their family businesses before death to spare their heirs the costs and burdens of a hostile government takeover via estate taxes.<p>

<b>Tax Rates.</b>  Federal estate tax rates range effectively from 37 percent up to 55 percent, plus an additional 5 percent on very large estates.  <i>It is important to understand the fact that this is not 55 percent of income, it is 55 percent of all assets in an estate.</i>  The first $600,000 is exempt from taxation.  (The Contract with America proposal, which recently passed the U.S. House of Representatives, increases the estate tax exemption to $750,000.)<p>

	The gift tax is levied at the same rates as the estate tax, excluding $10,000 per recipient annually.  In addition, a generation-skipping tax is imposed on gifts and bequests to grandchildren.  The generation-skipping tax is levied at an additional, flat rate of 55 percent on amounts in excess of $1 million.<p>

<b>Tax Revenues.</b>  As is always the case when government pushes tax rates too high, tax revenues are relatively insignificant.  As already noted, high estate tax rates intensify tax avoidance efforts and create disincentives for investment, saving, and entrepreneurship.  <i>In 1994, estate and gift taxes accounted for a mere 1.2 percent of total federal government receipts, or $15.2 billion.  Between 1974 and 1994, there has been virtually no inflation-adjusted increase in federal estate and gift tax revenues (only a 0.6 percent increase).</i>  In addition, a good portion of these revenues are eaten up by the federal government's compliance efforts related to estate and other death taxes -- some estimates say as much as 75 percent of estate and gift tax collections are offset by the costs of the IRS, the Treasury Department, and litigation.<a href="#foot2">2</a><p>

<b>Economic Growth and Job Creation.</b>  In the 1970s, Australia and Canada repealed their estate taxes.  While not exactly bastions of free-market economics, both these nations came to realize that estate levies were hurting investment, economic growth and job creation.

	In the most extreme cases, the U.S. tax structure has pushed many upper-income individuals to reject their citizenship, taking up official residence in less-taxing lands.  Again, estate taxes play a major part in such decisions.  <i>Forbes</i> magazine ran a cover story about such individuals entitled "The New Refugees" in its November 21, 1994 issue.  While some might say, "Good riddance to such traitors," the economics underlying the situation should be reviewed.<p>

	A simple question arises: Why does the U.S. impose such a punitive tax code to the point where productive individuals will take the dramatic step of renouncing their citizenship in order to prosper elsewhere? Though the problem of taxing productive individuals out of a country is not new one.  In the late eighteenth century, the great economist Adam Smith warned in <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>:

	<blockquote>"The proprietor of stock is properly a citizen of the world, and is not necessarily attached to any particular country.  He would be apt to abandon the country in which he was exposed to a vexatious inquisition, in order to be assessed to a burdensome tax, and would remove his stock to some other country where he could either carry on his business, or enjoy his fortune more at his ease.  By removing his stock he would put an end to all the industry which it had maintained in the country which he left."</blockquote>

This observation takes on even greater significance considering today's worldwide competition for increasingly mobile capital -- made even more mobile through global electronic transfers of funds.<p>

	A 1993 study by the Center for the Study of Taxation estimated the economic impact of repealing estate taxes in the United States.  The study estimated that under a no-estate-tax scenario by the year 2000, GDP would be $79.2 billion higher, 228,000 more jobs would be created, and $630 billion more in savings and capital would accumulate.<p>

<b>End Government Hostile Takeovers.</b>  In the private sector, a hostile takeover often means that the owners (i.e., shareholders) of the targeted company will benefit as their shares in the firm increase in price.  Under the government's hostile takeovers of thousands of family-owned businesses each year via the estate and other death taxes, heirs are decimated as the government often lays claim to more than half the company's assets.  Resources are funneled away from productive, private-sector ventures to often-dubious, unproductive government programs.<p>

	The only justification for estate taxes is envy -- a desire to perpetuate class warfare and worn-out, failed government redistribution schemes.  But as we all know, envy is a poor foundation upon which to base a tax code.  Sound economics is preferable.  The economics of estate taxes tells us that such levies create disincentives to invest, save, and take risks; reduce economic growth and job creation; and are expensive to administer. The time has come to repeal the estate and other death taxes in the United States.  Government's hostile takeovers of family businesses and assets must come to an end.  If not, the government will continue to destroy America's free enterprise system and our great heritage of family-owned businesses.<p>

<title>The Facts About Capital Gains Tax Reduction</title>
</head>

<h2>The Facts About Capital Gains Tax Reduction</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<i>"History shows that class warfare does not make for good economic policy."</i><p>

-- Sydney Hoff-Hay, SBSC Board Member, in testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Small Business, 1/26/95.<p>


<i>"While I fully support the elimination of the capital gains tax, the reduction and indexation ... in the Contract With America would result in lower capital costs, increased capital formation, new and higher-paying jobs, and increased investment in start-up enterprises, as well as business expansions."</i><p>

-- Richard Rahn, Ph.D., SBSC Board Member, in testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Small Business, 2/22/95.<p>


<i>"As long as risk-taking is punished, growth will be smothered.... I genuinely believe we will open the 21st century without a tax on capital gains, as we opened the 20th century."</i><p>

--Jude Wanniski, economist, before the U.S. Senate, 2/15/95.<p>
<hr>

	Much-needed capital gains tax reduction has been placed on hold since then-Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell almost single-handedly killed it in 1989. During the 1992 campaign, thenpresidential candidate Bill Clinton mentioned the possibility of indexing capital gains for inflation. Nevertheless, President Clinton has voiced opposition to capital gains tax reduction.<p>

Finally, the House Republican "Contract With America" called for significant capital gains tax reduction -- a 50 percent capital gains exclusion from taxation, effectively dropping the top tax rate for individuals from 28 percent to 19.8 percent, and prospective indexing for inflation. At a minimum, <i>the Small Business Survival Committee supports the Houseplanfor capital gains tax reduction, but urges the complete elimination of capital gains taxes.</i><p>

Our bold stance on the capital gains front is based on the facts, which are so often left out of the capital gains tax debate:<p>

<b>Improved Incentives for Investment and Entrepreneurship.</b> Investment and entrepreneurship are the driving forces behind economic growth and job creation. The economy needs individuals who are willing to undertake the great risks of investing sweat and/or capital in new and expanding businesses -- cssentially in new ideas.<p>

	Capital gains taxes raise the costs of such enterprises -reducing potential returns, and thereby reducing risk taking, investment, and economic growth. <i>Basic economics tells us that cutting or eliminaneg the capital-gains tax will enhance incentivesfor investment and entrepreneurship.</i><p>

<b>Widespread Benefits.</b> Critics of capital gains tax reduction illustrate great ignorance when asserting that a capital gains tax cut "will only benefft the rich."<p>

	<i>First</i>, improving incentives for investment and entrepreneurship has widespread economic benefits -- greater competition, more products and services for consumers, greater economic growth, and <i>more jobs</i>. After all, employees need employers. Providing incentives for individuals to expand existing businesses or to create new enterprises is the engine of job creation.  Absurdly, critics seem to think that individuals and the economy somehow benefit from taking resources away from venture capitalists, investors, and entrepreneurs, and giving it to the government.  <i>The problem remains that while government can redistribute, and even destroy, it cannot create</i>.<p>

	Second, capital gains are spread across a wide income spectrum.  According to 1992 federal income tax returns (most recent available), 56 percent of returns claiming capital gains were from incomes of $50,000 or less, 73 percent of returns with capital gains were from incomes of less than $75,000, while incomes of less than $100,000 claimed 83 percent of returns with capital gains.<p>

	Third, any discussion of which income levels derive direct benefits from capital gains tax reduction will be misleading because capital gains are included in the measurement of income.  Therefore, individuals who perhaps claim one-time or very infrequent capital gains income can be launched into a considerably higher income bracket <i>for only the year in which the capital gain is claimed</i>.  Opponents of capital gains tax cuts misleadingly claim that the rich capture the benefits of tax cuts without mentioning the facts about income measurement.<p>

	<i>Fourth</i>, even if <i>all</i> the direct benefits of capital gains tax reduction accrued to the "rich" -- which they do not -- one must ask: Who possesses better incentives to invest money more wisely, a rich person investing his own money or a government bureaucrat spending the taxpayers' money?<p>

<b>Double Taxation</b>.  Capital gains taxes represent a form of double taxation,  Individuals pay taxes on income they earn, and then choose to either save, invest, or consume their after-tax dollars.  The federal government does not tax consumption, but certainly does tax the benefits of saving and investing.  <i>Eliminating capital gains taxes, as well as taxes on interest earned from saving, alleviates the bias against saving and investment</i>.<p>

<b>Equalizing Tax Treatment of Capital Gains with Government Debt</b>.  Interest on most state and local government debt instruments are not subject to federal taxation, while capital gains are taxed.  This tax structure makes no economic sense.  Government securities present few risks for investors, while investments in private-sector equities, business expansion, and new enterprises offer considerable risks.  In addition, government debt generally finances rather unproductive government projects and programs, while capital gains are generated by successful private-sector enterprises that boost the economy, expand the tax base, and create real jobs.  <i>Clearly, capital gains income should receive the same tax treatment as interest on state and local government debt</i>.<p>

<b>Capital Gains Tax Reduction and Federal Tax Revenues</b>.  Static government analyses project revenue losses from capital gains tax reduction.  However, as the top tax rate on capital gains declined from almost 50 percent to 20 percent between 1978 and 1985, capital gains tax receipts <i>increased</i> from $9.1 billion to $26.5 billion.<a href="#foot1">1</a>  In contrast, the 1986 Tax Reform Act hiked the capital gains tax rate by 40 percent -- from 20 percent to 28 percent -- but by 1992 capital gains tax revenues registered about the same amount as were collected in 1985 (far less in real terms).  Naturally, the increase in the capital gains tax rate resulted in far lower capital gains realizations.<p>

	After all, the economy is dynamic, not static.  Therefore, individuals will alter their economic behavior according to the incentives established by governmental policies.  Even the complete elimination of capital gains taxes on individuals does not mean that the federal government will lose all of the $26 billion or so it collects from this levy because investment and entrepreneurship will respond positively, spurring growth and creating revenue feedback for the federal government through other levies.<p>

<b>International Treatment of Capital Gains</b>.  Most of our top international competitors -- including Japan and Germany -- do not tax capital gains as harshly as the U.S. does.  In fact, <i>nations like Hong Kong, the Netherlands, and Germany do not tax capital gains income at all</i>.<p>

	Even nations like Great Britain and Australia who tax capital gains at 40 percent and 48.3 percent, respectively -- higher rates than the U.S. -- adjust asset prices for inflation.  Once inflation is factored into the equation, the <i>real</i> U.S. capital gains tax rate jumps much higher than the stated rate of 28 percent -- often well in excess of 50 percent.  In fact, many U.S. taxpayers wind up paying taxes on <i>real</i> capital losses.<p>

	In addition, most states and some cities levy their own capital gains taxes -- pushing the total capital gains tax rate even higher.<p>

<b>Unlocking Past Gains and Improving Economic Efficiency</b>.  Literally trillions of dollars are locked into investments at present because high tax rates, especially after adjusting for inflation, create significant disincentives for investors to sell.  <i>Eliminating capital gains taxes would unlock huge amounts of capital -- that are artificially locked in because of current tax treatment of capital gains income -- to be reinvested in new and growing ventures</i>.

	When one moves past the class warfare rhetoric and nonsensical arguments against capital gains tax reduction, the economics are clear.  <i>Sharply reducing or eliminating capital gains taxes increases potential returns on investment and entrepreneurship, thereby promoting economic growth and job creation</i>.

<h2>Competition and Common Sense:</h2>
<h2>The Two Essential Ingredients for Constructive</h2>
<h2>Health Care Reform</h2>

By Raymond J. Keating
</center>
<hr>

<i>"Anyone familiar with my career in public service knows I strongly favor the social goals of relieving poverty and enhancing the quality of life for all people.  Not one American should be denied access to health care.  But in trying to collect the costs from business, we assume every employer can effectively play a national version of the street corner shell game, with the consumer paying the bill.  But consumers have choices and some businesses have real limitations on what they can charge for products or services.  When government is unmindful of these dynamics, it often means loss of employment for those we seek to help."<p>
</i>
--George McGovern, Insight, 4/26/93<p>


<i>"According to ... the CATO Institute, MSAs would lower the nation's annual health care bill by $33 billion"</i><p>

--National Center for Policy Analysis, Health Care Briefing Book<p>

<hr>

	The misguided effort by President and Mrs. Clinton to further inject government into the U.S. health care system thankfully died in 1994.  However, the underlying struture that makes health care so costly still lives on -- i.e., an expanded definition of "insurance," the prevailing use of third-party payments, and government regulations which prevent innovative methods for making health care affordable and accessible.  in addition, self-employed entrepreneurs and uninsured individuals are not given equal tax treatment in terms of their health care expenditures as is received by employer-based insurance plans.<p>

	In order to control costs, increase choices, and further enhance quality, <i>market-based</i> health care reforms are needed.  The byer-seller relationsh8ip between consumers and suppliers of health care services needs to be re-established.  Under a thrd-party system of payments, neither consumer nor provider have an incentive to be concerned about costs.  Therefore, costs naturally rise.<p>

	There are two veins to thise thrid-party payment system.  First, government involvement in the health care market has increased, especially since the inception of Medicaid and Medicare in the mid-1960s.  Second, the concept of "insurance" has been vastly expanded. By definition, insurance is supposd to cover  catastrophic and unforeseen events.  Today, health insurance plans cover small and predictable expenses.  Such a perversion of health insurance would be the equivalent of extending one's home-owners insurance to cover the costs of mowing the law, trimming and painting the house.<p>

	Make no mistakes, third-party payments have increased dramatically over the past three decades.  For example, according to economist Ed Rebenstein in his book <i>Right Data</i>, in 1950 government fianced 25.3 percent of health care expenditures, private insurance 15.8 percent, and 58.9 percentcovered out of pocket.  As of 1965, government's share had risen to 26.2 percent, private insurance rose to 28.1 percent, while out-of-pocket fiancing fell to 45.7 percent.  By 1990, government fianced health care expenditures reached 42.4 percent, private insurance hit 37.2 percent, with out-of-pocket fiancing falling to a mere 20.4 percent.  According to the <i>Statistical Abstract of the United States</i> 1994, in 1991, government fianced expenditures equaled 43.9 percent, private insurance and other private sources 36.9 percent, and 19.2 percent out of pocket.<p>

	The effect of this usurpation of the buyer-seller relationship has been clear -- rising costs.  For example, per capita U.S. health care expenditures between 1965 and 1991 increased by 1,306 percent, versus a rise in the consumer price index of 332 percent.<p>

	The Small Business Survival Committee believes that two reform measures by the 104th Congress and the Administration would go a long way in curing what ails the health care marketplace.<p>

<b>Medical Savings Accounts.</b> Incentives need to be established so that individuals can save to cover the costs of standard, predictable health care expenses out of pocket, while also purchasing catastrophic health care insurance.  Allowing individuals to establish tax-free medical savings accounts (MSAs) would provide the basis for such a system.<p>

	The most common MSA scenario would have employers and employees shifting payments from a standard health plan to a split system of an MSA and a catastrophic plan.  For example, a standard plan costing $5,000 could be replaced with $3,000 going into an employee's MSA ($2,500 from the employer and $500 from the employee) and $2,000 covering a catastrophic plan with a $3,000 deductible.<p>

	The employee withdraws funds from the MSA, penalty free, to pay out-of-pocket medical expenses.  Since the employee has an established "budget" and is able to keep what he does not use by the end of the year, the employee has an incentive to spend more prudently and comparison shop for health care purchases.  After all, <i>the critical issue in making health care more accessible is to make it more affordable.</i>  If consumers become more concerned with costs, health care providers are forced to be more cost sensitive in pricing health care services.<p>

	Also, many individuals would be able to build up a large amount of savings in their MSAs, which in turn would help offset health care costs in case the employee lost his job.  Such a plan could be designed to help the poor as well -- eventually replacing Medicaid, and its daunting bureaucracy and costs, with health care vouchers that could be deposited in MSAs.  Again, this would go a long way in helping to alleviate some of the high costs associated with third-party payers, in the case of Medicaid, the government.<p>

	In places where MSA plans already are being tried, the results have been quite positive.  For example:<p>

<ul>
<li>A recent study (January 11, 1995) by the Evergreen Freedom Foundation in Olympia, Washington reviewed MSA plans currently in use.  They found that the use of MSAs generated "reduced health care spending by sponsors/employers and employees; wiser use of health services by consumers; greater use of preventive services; increased consumer involvement in health care decisions and purchases; dollar savings and improved choice for healthy and ill people; MSA preference by low-income employees; [and] strong employee participation and satisfaction."

<li>Also, the Evergreen report noted that the MSA plan instituted by Forbes, Inc. has reduced insurance premiums by 27 percent since 1991.

<li>According to a survey by The Luntz Research Companies, 98 percent of the employees at Golden Rule Insurance (Indianapolis, Indiana) enrolled in the companyÕs MSA plan are satisfied with the program.  Ninety percent of Golden RuleÕs employees have chosen to enroll in the plan, with the average enrollee accumulating $1,002 in refunds in 1994.  About half of those receiving refunds planned to spend the money on living expenses, holiday gifts and other items, while the other half planned on keeping their money in an interest-bearing MSA reserve account or investing the money in other ways.  Total employee refunds for 1993 and 1994 amounted to $1.2 million.  In addition, for the second straight year using MSAs, Golden Rule has had no rate increase.
</ul><p>

<b>Equalized Tax Treatment of Health Care Expenditures for the Self-Employed and Uninsured.</b>  The current tax system allows full tax deductibility for employer-provided health insurance, but denies such treatment to out-of-pocket health care expenditures and self-employed individuals.  In order to ensure that individuals and entrepreneurs can afford health care, their health care expenses -- whether for insurance or out-of-pocket payments -- should be allowed full tax deductibility.<p>

	The current system of only allowing full tax deductibility for employer-provided insurance benefits larger companies and their employees, leaving entrepreneurs and uninsured workers behind.  Extending 100-percent deductibility to entrepreneurs merely levels the playing field.  In turn, full deductibility may help to foster entrepreneurship.  Many individuals are unwilling to undertake the risks of starting a new business because once they leave the security of being an employee in an established firm, they may lose health care benefits.  Allowing for 100-percent deductibility would give an added incentive for individuals to start their own businesses.<p>

	Unbelievably, Congress and the Administration even allowed the 25-percent deduction for health insurance premiums paid by the self-employed to expire last year.  As a first step, Congress should reinstate this 25-percent deduction immediately (which will still require many individuals to file amended tax returns), and then phase in the 100-percent deduction.<p>

	
	MSAs and full tax deductibility for individuals and entrepreneurs are the kind of market-oriented health care reform measures that will provide greater access to care, enhanced choice for health care consumers, while providing incentives to control costs.  Health care reform may be the arena where the degree of real change brought about by this past election will be measured.  In fact, House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer (R-Tx.) is expected to introduce a bill shortly that will include MSAs.<p>

	A government-driven health care plan is one of a primary reason that the Clinton Administration is taking on water.  Market-driven health care reforms could buoy the new Congress.<p>

<h2>Eliminating Capital Gains Taxes:<br>
Lifeblood for an Entrepreneurial Economy</h2><p>
by Raymond J. Keating<p>
</center>
<hr>

<i>"[W]e have to cut the rate on capital gains, which is ... a vacuum sucking up our capital savings into the general treasury."<p></i>

-- U.S. Rep. Bill Archer.<p>
<p>

<i>"Better yet, eliminate capital-gains taxes entirely."</i><p>

-- Ed Rubenstein, Economics Analyst, National Review<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>"Investors are naturally reluctant to support new ventures in decaying urban neighborhoods where theft, drug abuse, violent crime and buisness bankruptcy rates are all very high.  This source of venture capital will not be tapped until sufficient incentives make inner-city investment more attractive to individual backers.  Conversely, reducing the tax on capital gains effectively increases the flow of fiancial 'seed corn' to budding entrepreneurs."<p>
</i>
-- Wall Street Journal op-ed, 8/25/93, by the chairman and four members of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.<p>
<p>
<hr>
Most entrepreneurs seeking to start up or expand an enterprise will tell you of a major obstacle -- raising capital.  The answer to this problem is not a proliferation of governmental entities siphoning taxpayer funds to fledgling businesses.  Instead, encouragement for private-sector investment in small business needs to be enhanced.<p>

Investment and entrepreneurship are the lifeblood of a vibrant economy.  There is no more important economic task than investing both	sweat and capital in new ideas, innovations, and enterprises.  Yet, the risky nature of such ventures often scares off bank lending officers.  Therefore, venture capital, whether raised from one's family and friends or from professional investors, remains a critical source of funding for entrepreneurial enterprises.<p>

In the economic world of risk-and-reward tradeoffs, the <i>opportunity</i> for high returns must be present in order to entice investment in such high-risk ventures.  Capital gains taxes significantly cut into those returns, thereby diminishing incentives to invest.<p>

The Republican majorities in both houses of the new Congress are considering a reduction in the federal capital gains tax rate, and indexing the rate for inflation.  These are crucial steps to igniting entrepreneurship and investment in the U.S. economy, and thereby stimulating economic growth and job creation.  Though, <i>in order to make the United States a capital haven and an economic-growth juggernaut, taxes on capital gains should be eliminated altogether.</i><p>

<h3>Indexation</h3>

The nominal rate of federal taxation on capital gains income is 28 percent.<a href="#foot1">1</a>   However, when inflation is factored into the capital gains equation the <i>real</i> capital gains tax rate rises substantially.<p>

For example, an individual that made a $10,000 venture capital investment in 1987, and sold it for $15,000 in 1993, would owe $1,400 in federal capital gains taxes at the 28 percent rate.  However, when factoring inflation (we use the gross domestic product deflator) into this equation, the real capital gains tax rate on this transaction jumps to 53 percent.<a href="#foot2">2</a><p>

The lack of indexation creates additional disincentives for investment and entrepreneurship, restraining small-business growth and job creation.  In fact, some individuals can wind up paying taxes on <i>real capital losses</i>.  That is, after factoring inflation into the equation, a nominal profit on a transaction can turn out to be a real loss, yet the investor still pays taxes on the nominal gain.<p>

Depending on the Federal Reserve's success in maintaining stable prices, the real capital gains tax rate can fluctuate considerably as well.  Figure 1 offers an example of how the Fed's efforts, or lack thereof, to fight inflation can impact capital gains tax rates.  Listed are the real capital gains tax rates from 1977 through 1993 on three-year investments yielding a total nominal return of 30 percent.  It is assumed that the investment is closed out at the end of the stated year, for example, the 1985 real capital gains tax rate relates to an investment made at the beginning of 1983 and sold at the end of 1985.<p>

<hr>	These real rates of capital gaasdfbacsadfasdfsfdwerwerqwerq4ins taxation 	represent severe impediments to keeping America's economy vibrant and growing.  A 28 percent capital gains tax rate acts as a considerable disincentive to investment, while real rates ranging from 40 percent to 494 percent to even paying taxes on a real capital loss, amount to economic suicide.  Indexation would eliminate inflation as a factor in capital gains determination -- equalizing stated and real capital gains tax rates.  The lower real rate would reduce uncertainty, and generate investment, economic growth, and job creation.<p>

<h3>From Cutting to Eliminating the Capital Gains Tax</h3>

	Members of the new Congress are considering a reduction in the capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 19.8 percent by providing for a 50-percent exclusion on capital gains income.   Combined with indexation, reducing the top capital gains tax rate to 19.8 percent could be the most pro-growth step taken by the new Congress.<p>

	However, given the critical and high-risk nature of investment and entrepreneurship, and  the importance of maintaining a competitive environment in a global economy, capital gains should be excluded from taxation altogether.  A zero percent capital gains tax rate would ensure that entrepreneurial risk taking, so crucial to economic growth, would not be impeded by the U.S. federal tax code.<p>

	Figure 2 offers a comparison of capital gains tax rates among various nations.  The current U.S. non-indexed capital gains tax rate is not competitive internationally.  Even the two nations -- Australia and the United Kingdom -- with higher nominal rates than the United States allow for capital gains to be indexed for inflation.  Hence, the U.S. real capital gains tax rate often will exceed the rate in Australia and the U.K., depending on U.S. inflation.<p>

<hr>

	From a capital gains perspective, these other nations offer a more conducive and dynamic environment for investment and entrepreneurship.  In a competitive, global economy, a zero percent capital gains tax rate would make the United States a magnet for capital.  Eliminating the capital gains tax would be the most pro-growth, proactive jobs program taken by the new Congress.<p>

<h3>The Growth Effects</h3>

	The potential benefits of eliminating the capital gains tax are clear.  Figure 3, for example, notes that venture capital investment was on the rise as the U.S. capital gains tax rate declined up to 1986; followed by a dramatic downturn as the rate was hiked 40 percent in 1987, from 20 percent to 28 percent.  Eliminating the capital gains tax would  augment incentives to invest in new and expanding ventures.<p>

	In a report released earlier this year,<a href="#foot3">3</a> and reported on in the Small Business Survival Committee's July 1994 <i>Small Business and the Economy</i> newsletter, economists Gary and Aldona Robbins estimated the economic impact of eliminating the federal capital gains tax.  By the year 2000, the Robbins' projected that a zero percent capital gains tax rate would lead to: <p>

<ul>
<li>an additional $3.2 trillion in capital formation;
<li>the creation of 1.1 million additional jobs;
<li>an extra $1.6 trillion in GDP between 1994 and 2000, with annual GDP $391 billion higher than otherwise by the year 2000;
<li>an additional 0.43 percentage points on the long-term annual growth rate for the economy.
</ul><p>

<h3>Government Revenues</h3>

	Gary and Aldona Robbins also noted that much of the lost revenue to the federal government would be recaptured due to enhanced economic growth resulting from the elimination of the capital gains tax.  In fact, when accounting for higher state and local revenues due to a higher rate of growth, they estimate that all levels of government would <i>net</i> $25 billion annually by the year 2000.<p>

	The Robbins' "dynamic" assumptions regarding the recapturing of revenues due to enhanced economic growth are much more realistic than the "static" models normally employed by critics of capital gains tax reduction.  After all, the economy is dynamic -- in the sense that individuals respond to incentives.  People are not static economic variables.<p>

	However, even if one is forced to employ unrealistic, static assumptions regarding revenue projections, the case for eliminating the capital gains tax still stands.  The purpose for eliminating capital gains taxes is to spur investment, entrepreneurship, and economic growth and opportunity.  If that means cutting government spending more deeply than might be called for under a more realistic, dynamic assessment of revenues, so be it.<p>

<h3>Who Benefits?</h3>

	Opponents will employ class warfare tactics, and argue that a capital gains tax is merely a sop to the wealthy.  However, capital gains taxes are not levies on the wealthy, but levies on wealth creation.  As argued here, the benefits of eliminating capital gains levies will be felt throughout the economy as economic growth accelerates.  Simply speaking, you can't have job creation without capital investment and entrepreneurs.<p>

	In addition, capital gains tend to be spread across a wider income spectrum than many believe.  As noted in Figure 4, based on 1992 federal income tax returns (most recent available), 56 percent of returns claiming capital gains were from incomes of $50,000 or less, including the capital gain.  As Figure 5 shows, total incomes of less than $100,000, including capital gains, claimed 83 percent of returns with capital gains.<a href="#foot4">4</a><p>

<h3>Wages and Interest vs. Capital Gains</h3>

	In addition to their false assumptions about large revenue losses and the identification of capital gains just with the wealthy, opponents of cutting or eliminating capital gains taxes often argue that no reason exists for differing tax treatments between capital gains and, for example, wage or interest income.<p>

	In fact, there is a distinct difference between wage or even interest income and capital gains -- risk.  Capital gains come from growth and appreciation of investments, which tend to carry greater risks than those associated with earning wages or even interest.  In particular, investments in small, entrepreneurial ventures carry significant risk.  As already noted, high-risk ventures must at least present the opportunity for high rewards.<p>

<h3>Small Business and the Economy Will Benefit From a 0% Capital Gains Tax Rate</h3>

	Small business is the engine of economic growth and job creation.  In order to undertake and/or expand a small business, one needs capital.  Without adequate capital, new ideas and businesses either never make it to the marketplace or they die a premature death.  And with such deaths also go products, services, and jobs.  By eliminating the capital gains tax, Congress and the Administration would greatly strengthen incentives for investment and entrepreneurship -- boosting economic growth and opportunity.<p>

	History shows that class warfare does not make for good economic policy.  In fact, during the 1980s, while tax rates declined, upper-income individuals paid a greater share of total income taxes, as the benefits of tax shelters declined and the rewards for working, saving and investment rose.  In this environment, from 1980 to 1989, 18 million jobs were created, and the employment ratio<a href="#head5">5</a> reached a record-high 63 percent in 1989.<p>

	The 1986 Tax Reform Act made positive strides by reducing personal and corporate tax rates, but went awry by trying to "pay" for these reductions with an increase in the capital gains tax rate.  Indeed, the economy paid a price for this capital gains tax hike in the form reduced venture capital investment and restrained entrepreneurship.<p>

	The time has come to unleash entrepreneurial capitalism by eliminating the capital gains tax.<p>

Founded in 1973, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> is a research and 
educational institute -- a think tank -- whose mission is to formulate and promote 
conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited 
government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national 
defense.
<p>
Heritage's staff pursues this mission by performing timely, accurate research addressing 
key policy issues and effectively marketing these findings to our primary audiences: 
members of Congress, key congressional staff members, policymakers in the executive 
branch, the nation's news media, and the academic and policy communities.  Heritage's 
products include publications, articles, lectures, conferences, and meetings.
<p>
Governed by an independent Board of Trustees, The Heritage Foundation is a non-
partisan, tax-exempt institution.  Heritage relies on the private financial support of the 
general public -- individuals, foundations, and corporations -- for its income, and accepts 
no government funds and performs no contract work.  Heritage is one of the nations 
largest public policy research organizations.  More than 200,000 contributors make it the 
most broadly supported think tank in America.

<title>Directory of Public Policy Organizations -- Intro -- 
Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h2>Introduction</h2><hr width=50%></center>
<p>
	The <a href="dppo-toc.html"><i>Directory of Public Policy Organizations</i></a> is a publication of The Heritage Foundation's <a 
href="/heritage/dept_writeups/rban.htm">Resource Bank</a>. This first 
edition lists public policy organizations that may generally be said to 
share the broadly "conservative" or "classical liberal" point of view. It is 
our hope that this directory will be helpful to the news media, 
government officials, policy groups, academic institutions, and the public 
in locating organizations on the full range of public policy issues.
<p>
	Building the conservative movement is the main function of the 
nineteen-year-old Resource Bank. Part of Heritage's <a 
href="/heritage/dept_writeups/extrel.html">External Relations 
Department</a>, the Resource Bank is a communications link and 
information clearinghouse for some 400 conservative policy groups and 
2,000 conservative experts and scholars around the world. 
<p>
	Its main activities include publishing the monthly <a 
href="rtoc.html#insid"><i>Insider</i></a> newsletter and biennial 
Guide to Public Policy Experts; hosting several regular policy working 
groups; building directories of policy organizations, experts, and 
activists; organizing conferences and meetings of conservative scholars 
and policy group directors; and handling referrals concerning 
conservative groups and experts. 
<p>
	Placing special emphasis on the growing network of grassroots 
and state policy organizations, The Heritage Foundation's Resource 
Bank advances the conservative cause by highlighting the work of other 
conservative groups, promoting strong intra-movement communications, 
and organizing timely leadership strategy forums.

<center><h3>BANISHING THE BARD, AND OTHER ENGLISH TRAGEDIES</h3></center>

<p>

William Shakespeare and other great authors
of English literature are no longer required reading at most of
the nation's top colleges and universities, according to a study
released last week by the National Alumni Forum.  &quot;The Shakespeare
File:  What English Majors Are Really Studying&quot; surveys English
major requirements at 70 leading institutions of higher learning.

<p>

The National Alumni Forum (NAF), a non-profit
organization &quot;dedicated to academic freedom and excellence&quot;
and chaired by Lynne Cheney, launched its study when Georgetown
University announced in early 1996 the elimination of its great
authors requirement for English majors.  Georgetown had been among
the many colleges which, until recently, required majors to study
the work of at least one (in Georgetown's case, two) of the three
writers hailed as &quot;the pre-eminent representatives of English
language and literature -- Geoffrey Chaucer, William Shakespeare,
and John Milton.&quot;

<p>

Of the 70 schools surveyed, only 23 now require
English majors to take a Shakespeare course, which NAF loosely
defined as any course in which students read two of the three
great English authors.  &quot;The National Alumni Forum conducted
this study to see if the decline in standards at Georgetown was
an isolated incident or part of a national trend,&quot; NAF president
Jerry L. Martin explained.  &quot;The survey confirmed our worst
fears.  Dropping Shakespeare is not just a trend; it is the norm.&quot;

<p>

Shakespeare gets the boot for courses in pop
culture and sex.  The NAF study reports a litany of new fads (in
terms taken directly from course descriptions):  advertising imagery,
AIDS activism, attitudes to marriage, capture of the state, electronic
frontier, feminism, futurism, global factory, homophobia, living
arrangements, Madonna, music videos, oppression and marginalization,
politics of representation, rock and rap music, socialist struggle,
transnationalism, work and play habits, world wide web, etc.

<p>

&quot;Individuals will be exposed to popular
culture their whole lives; college is the time for studying something
deeper and more enduring,&quot; the NAF report aptly remarks.
C.S. Lewis also warned of &quot;the dangers of an exclusive contemporary
diet.  A new book is still on its trial and the amateur is not
in a position to judge it&quot;  (&quot;On the Reading of Old
Books&quot;; <I>God in the Dock</I>).  How will students be able
to critique any of these topics in modern culture without a mooring
in the literature of the past?

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;Universities without Shakespeare?
Unthinkable. Language without Shakespeare?  Unspeakable.  I'm
heartened by the National Alumni Forum's effort to stop the erosion

<center><h3>HIGHER ON DRUGS</h3></center>

<p>

One in five 10th graders used marijuana within
the past month, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse's
&quot;Monitoring the Future Survey&quot; released December 19.
The survey found a <I><B>190 percent</B></I> <I><B>increase</B></I>
over the past five years in adolescent use of illicit drugs.

<p>

The survey also indicates a move from dabbling
to dependence.  Among high school seniors who use marijuana, one
in nine smoke it daily.  The perception of risk associated with
marijuana has declined -- by 25 percent since 1991 -- a trend
that won't be reversed without a strong, certain message from
national leaders.

<p>

&quot;President Clinton has been outspoken
about snuffing-out Joe Camel and Mr. Kool but has been virtually
silent on illicit drugs.  School-age children know the president's
MTV 'I didn't inhale' confession and use it to trivialize drug
use,&quot; notes FRC Senior Policy Analyst Lt. Col. Robert Maginnis.
&quot;It's about time the president, who has forced states to
increase their level of enforcement on tobacco, put a similar
emphasis on fighting the drug scourge -- especially the legalization
campaign that has already overwhelmed California and Arizona and
threatens to engulf the rest of the country.&quot;

<p>

In response to California and Arizona drug
legalization propositions which passed in November, a Clinton
Administration team presented last Monday its campaign against
further drug legalization.  &quot;The only problem was that the
team was missing its quarterback.  President Clinton needs to
personally tackle this national crisis,&quot;  Col. Maginnis said.

<p>

The Goals 2000 legislation ostensibly aims
for drug-free schools by the Year 2000.  Two and a half years
after its passage, the problem continues to get worse, in part
because the president who gave us Goals 2000 hasn't given us a
clear message on drugs.

<p>

<b>ACTION:</b>  Talk to your kids about the dangers of drugs.  Watch 
for resources from Family Research Council in the weeks to come.

<title>Legislative Hotline</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/hotline/hotline.gif"></center>

<p>

<center><h2>Hotline for Week of December 6-13</h2></center>

<p>

Welcome to the FRC information line.  Please note FRC's new address!
Our phone and fax numbers remain the same.  This message will
continue to be updated periodically until the 105th Congress reconvenes
in January.

<p>

As President Clinton announces some of his <a href="#cabinet">Cabinet 
appointments</a>, an Hawaii court hands down a decision on 
<a href="#homosexual">homosexual &quot;marriage,&quot;</a>
and the House and Senate organize for the <a href="#105">105th 
Congress</a>.

<p><a name="homosexual">

<h3>Issue One: Hawaii's Judicial Decision on Homosexual 
&quot;Marriage.&quot;</h3>

<p>

In a major setback for traditional marriage in Hawaii, Judge
Kevin Chang ruled on December 3 that the state constitution requires
the recognition of same-sex &quot;marriage,&quot; or homosexual
&quot;marriage.&quot;  The judge based his decision on the argument
that the couples' <I>gender</I> was the cause for being refused
a marriage license.  Of course, the homosexual movement sees this
as a breakthrough in gaining equal status and gaining benefits
previously only given to traditional married couples, such as
tax and health insurance benefits.  Robert Knight, FRC's Director
of Cultural Studies denounced the court decision saying, &quot;In
striking down Hawaii's state law that preserves marriage as the
union of one man and one woman, Judge Kevin Chang has ignored
the wisdom of the ages, the will of the Hawaiian people, and ample
evidence of the state's compelling interest in preserving this
vital institution.  This decision underscores Congress' wisdom
in enacting the Defense of Marriage Act, which protects other
states from the Hawaiian courts' reckless activism.&quot;  Knight
calls on &quot;Americans to examine and to exercise ways to nullify
the actions of judges who flout the law.  This is no small legal
matter but an assault on morality and the rule of law itself.
Hawaiians can assist the entire nation by ending the judicial
arrogance that has precipitated this national threat to marriage.&quot;
The case will be appealed to the Hawaiian Supreme Court, and
in the meantime, no state &quot;marriage&quot; licenses for homosexual
couples will be issued.  Many legal analysts expect the State
Supreme Court to decide this case in the spring of 1997 and most
observers expect the Court to uphold Judge Chang's decision.
Homosexual couples &quot;married&quot; in Hawaii are then expected
to seek recognition of these unions by other states, if Judge
Chang's decision is upheld.  Homosexual activists are also expected
to file legal challenges to the Defense of Marriage Act, which
was enacted during the recently completed session of Congress.

<p><a name="105">

<h3>Issue Two: House and Senate Leadership and Committees for the 105th 
Congress.</h3>

<p>

In the House and Senate, both Democrats and Republicans have
largely re-elected their current leadership and made committee
assignments for the new 105th Congress, which convenes January
7, 1997.  In the House, Newt Gingrich was renominated Speaker
of the House;  Dick Armey for Majority Leader; and Tom DeLay for
Majority Whip.  Senate Republicans renominated Trent Lott of Mississippi
as the Majority Leader; Don Nickles (Okla.) Majority Whip; Connie
Mack (Fla.) as Conference Chairman; and Paul Coverdell (Ga.) as
Conference Secretary. FRC takes note that several new and current
pro-family Senators were assigned to key Senate Committees.  Senators
Lauch Faircloth (Ga.) and Larry Craig (Idaho) were assigned to
the powerful Appropriations Committee.  Pro-life Senator John
Ashcroft (Mo.) and Sen.-elect Jeff Sessions (Ala.) were assigned
to the Judiciary Committee, which is responsible for reviewing
federal judicial nominees.  In the House, pro-life Rep. Bob Livingston
remains chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee, and
two pro-life Representatives-elect were added:  Anne Northup (Ky.)
and Robert Aderholt (Ala.).  However, abortion rights leaders
Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) will also
join the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, respectively.
Pro-life champion Henry Hyde (Ill.) remains chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee and four newly elected pro-life members were
added:  William Jenkins (Tenn.), Asa Hutchinson (Ark.), Ed Pease
(Ind.) and Chris Cannon of Utah.  Pro-life Rep. Charles Canady
will remain the chairman of the Constitution subcommittee, which
has jurisdiction over the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, religious
freedom, parental rights and other key family issues.

<p><a name="cabinet">

<h3>Issue Three: New Liberal Clinton Cabinet Nominees.</h3>

<p>

On Thursday December 5th, President Clinton announced some of his top 
Cabinet nominees that would lead our national defense policy team.  Among 
his selections for these top positions are Madeline Albright, former US 
Ambassador to the UN, and retiring Senator Bill Cohen (R-ME).  Although both
of these individuals are aptly qualified, well-liked and respected
for their foreign policy knowledge and experience, both nominees
are considered to be cultural liberals.  Senator Cohen's appointment
as Secretary of Defense appears to be a gesture towards the moderate
and liberal Republicans in Congress at a time when the power between
the two parties is almost evenly divided.  Senator Cohen has
served a distinguished career in the U.S. Senate, however, he
has a record of consistently supporting federal funding of abortion
and even voted against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.  He
tends to support the homosexual rights agenda -- Sen. Cohen is
a supporter of legally recognized &quot;domestic partnerships&quot;
and the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), which would
elevate 'sexual orientation' to a specially protected status in
the area of employment.

<p>

Madeline Albright, President Clinton's recommended Secretary of
State, is a distinguished leader in foreign policy as demonstrated
during her tenure as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.  Yet,
in the midst of her broad background in foreign policy, her record
on cultural issues tends to be quite liberal.  As the leader of
the U.S. delegation to the Beijing Women's Conference, Albright
promised &quot;to see that American views and values are well
represented,&quot; however, the &quot;views and values&quot; which
she represented at the Conference were very much in line with
those advocated by western feminists -- an emphasis on &quot;reproductive
rights&quot; (i.e., abortion and unlimited contraceptive availability),
&quot;gender equality&quot; and the mainstreaming of a &quot;gender
perspective.&quot;  Although Ambassador Albright has expressed
opposition to forced abortions in China and religious persecution,
she has not backed any economic sanctions that would pressure
China to reform their human rights policies.

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<STRONG>Over the last five years, 775 young criminals -- some convicted of drug-dealing, robbery, and assault -- have taken Sergeant Roger Redd's crash course in law and order. All but a handful have stayed out of trouble. Here's how a former drill sergeant uses physical and moral discipline to shake men loose from a life of crime.
</STRONG>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It's early morning in Fayetteville, North Carolina, home to the army's 82nd Airborne Division. Thirty pairs of feet shuffle clumsily to the cadence of a husky-voiced sergeant. Perhaps it's a little too early for some of these recruits, who are having trouble following orders. "Don't show me a grin, I'm not a dentist," snaps Sergeant Roger Redd. "Don't anticipate the command. Pay attention. Engage the brain, engage the brain."

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Although the rows of young men with closely cropped hair may resemble greenhorn troops from nearby Fort Bragg, the scene is deceptive. The men are not recruits -- they're criminals. And this isn't boot camp, it's the parking lot of the Cumberland County courthouse.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"You say you got in trouble, you can't do anything with your life," Redd says. "Wrong answer. You decided to break the law. You made a mistake, but now you're going to profit from it. You're going to do right."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Welcome to Sergeant Redd's physical-training program, a court-approved plan to turn troublemakers on probation into law-abiding citizens. Redd, a court bailiff and former army drill sergeant, oversees a military-style regimen three mornings a week that mixes physical discipline, mental toughness, and common-sense counseling. Less than a chain gang but more than a Jane Fonda workout, Redd's 90-day program is being hailed locally as one of the most successful efforts anywhere to take youthful offenders otherwise bound for prison and turn their lives around. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In a few hours, Redd will be busy at his paying job: handcuffing suspects, breaking up fights, and escorting criminals to court or to jail. But now, at just after 5 a.m., he's volunteering to steer these youngsters away from a lawless future by giving them some private lessons on crime and punishment. One at a time, they stand up and explain how they got into trouble with the law.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"I was charged with auto theft," one mumbles.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"You were stealing cars," says Redd, pacing slowly.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"I wasn't stealin' cars. I was stealin' car parts."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"What were you gonna' do," Redd fires back, "put a car together?"
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"No."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Get down and push. It's 'no, <i>sir</i>!' "
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The boy drops to the ground and starts doing push-ups while others stand and recite their stories. No one else forgets to say "sir."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But Redd isn't through with them yet. "If you're used to using your conscience every day, then you're not going to go out and do something stupid," he says. "By the time you leave here, you should be remorseful for what you've done." His aim: teach personal responsibility and break the men of their "I'm a victim" mentality. Until that happens, Redd says, he won't be able to shake them loose from criminal behaviors and keep them out of prison.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Make no mistake: Prison is exactly where most of the men, ages 16 to 21, are headed. "Most come to this program because they failed every other method to keep them out of the Department of Corrections," says court administrator Kim Tucker. "This is the last stop."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	All are on probation for committing a nonviolent offense, such as breaking and entering, larceny, or drug possession. Many are repeat offenders, whose crimes as juveniles -- which are expunged from public record -- include arson, robbery, and even assault with a deadly weapon. Virtually all of them have violated the conditions of their probation, and are one step away from prison. "Most of them have never been taught discipline or respect," says Redd. "They're used to doing what they want to, on their own, when they get good and ready. And suddenly now someone's in charge telling them what to do and how not to do it. It's a shock to them."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This may be just the kind of shock therapy needed to jolt young lawbreakers to their senses. About 775 of the 875 men and women who've entered the program have gone on to complete it. According to the county court, only 15 of the graduates have been charged with subsequent criminal offenses. Redd, who keeps a file of each of his graduates, says that 65 have joined the army, and many have completed high school and gotten jobs. "I'm in a position to see a lot of young men come through here," says assistant district attorney Charles Scott, who regularly refers men to the program. "We've seen a very small number come back." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Criminal-justice officials say they know of no other alternatives to prison -- not boot camps, not home surveillance, not work programs -- that approach the program's success rates. "It's the best alternative sentencing program that I'm aware of in the state of North Carolina, and maybe nationally, in terms of results achieved," says E. Lynn Johnson, a superior-court judge who helped Redd launch the effort more than five years ago. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Redd got the idea after helplessly watching teens and young adults stream in and out of court -- men who, in Redd's view, needed a muscular dose of physical and moral discipline. But they weren't likely to get that from the state's probation system or from imprisonment. "Think about it. In prison you get free education, exercise, television," says Art Zeidman, a candidate for superior-court judge who has run alternatives-to-prison programs in Raleigh. "For the first-time offender, the system is one of a comfortable cocoon, and they don't feel a need to stay away from it." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Patricia Timmons Goodson, a district-court judge in Cumberland County, says she was "not satisfied at all" with her sentencing options. Supervised probation, a commonly used alternative to prison, often fails because a mere handful of county probation officers are asked to track nearly 1,900 youthful offenders now in the system. "You would continue to see many -- too many -- of the same young people coming back," she says.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Redd was convinced his army experience offered a solution. Participants in his program enter a structured training environment a few hours a day, three days a week, for three months. They must arrive on time, wear uniforms, and learn basic drills. They also receive regular warnings to stay in school, along with practical instruction about finding and keeping jobs.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Add to this Redd's blend of personal and professional grit: He grew up poor in a family of eight children; signed up for three tours in Vietnam as an infantry combat soldier; piloted an attack helicopter that was gunned down over Hamburger Hill; received five Purple Hearts for being wounded five times; spent six months in a hospital bed with a foot wound while doctors fretted that he would never walk again; and retired, a first sergeant with the 82nd Airborne, after 22 years in the military.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Redd's approach offers both a carrot and a stick. Graduates avoid jail and might also see the court relax their probation requirements. Nongraduates head straight to jail. Redd decides who is fit to graduate -- with no second chances and no appeals.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	An early believer, Judge Johnson first began referring men to the program in February 1991. Today, virtually every judge, district attorney, and probation officer in the county's court system scouts out offenders who might be good candidates. Court officers such as Goodson regularly don sneakers and sweats and join Redd in the morning to speak to his latest crop of students. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The key to Redd's strategy is using the best of his military training to reinforce good habits and, eventually, good attitudes. That includes regular drills, countless push-ups, five-mile runs, and swift consequences for disobeying commands. For these men, many of whom have dropped out of high school and haven't held a job, getting up and getting to the courthouse on time is a milestone in personal discipline.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Everyone gets a chance to act as a squad leader, yelling out drill commands. The reason: Many kids who get into trouble do so because they are followers, easily drawn into crime when they're idle. "The man is totally in control of his actions. He doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke, but he still has a great time," says Wesley, one of Redd's graduates who returns a few mornings a month to help train others in the program. "He's teaching them to act independently, not to go along with the crowd."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The approach differs from many boot-camp experiments, however, because it offers much more than a physical regimen. Says Johnson: "It goes beyond just physically getting in their faces and teaching them how many push-ups they can do, but teaching them to be a man or a woman along the way."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	How does the sergeant teach young men about manhood? In Redd's equation, it's the little decisions that matter, the choices that eventually add up to excellence and integrity. So when he sees his troops marching out of formation, he pounces. "That's raggedy," he barks. "I said a straight row. That's like being on your job and they want you to make sure the pots and pans are put away and they're clean. You do it and you do it <i>right</i>. Men have <i>discipline</i>."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Redd also counsels the men, individually and in groups. They never seem to know when he'll launch into a mini-sermon about responsibility, honesty, or conscience. Sometimes Redd will focus on building their self-respect: "Every one of you sitting here, from left to right, is just as good as I am. But now you've got a temporary setback," he says. "What you have to do is keep yourself straight and work hard." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	During his speech, Redd spots a late arrival who tries to slip into formation. He doesn't miss a beat: "Get down and <i>push!</i> If you're late tomorrow, just keep on running, right to jail. Because you're going to jail, because you can't follow instructions. You have an obligation and responsibility to yourself to get here on time."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	At other times, he presses home the obligation to show respect for others. One of his favorite phrases: "People have the right to be left alone." Redd asks the men to picture themselves as adult parents (some of them are), and to imagine one of their children dying of a cocaine overdose, or a stab wound, or from gun fire. "I want them to realize they would not want this to happen to their child," he says later. "So I place them in a predicament. It makes them wake up and think. Now we're engaging the brain."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	After less than a week in the program, Mike's brain already is engaged. He was convicted of burglary and assault with a weapon. Now, during a short break between drills, he says he's determined to graduate so he can clear his record. He's studying computer programming at Fayetteville Technical Training College. "I'm trying to think about the future," he says. Wesley, the recent grad who volunteers as a squad leader, was arrested on drug charges but now works as a graphic artist. "It gave me a real hope that I could still make something of myself," he says, "regardless of the past." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Redd usually works with about 50 men at a time (plus an occasional woman or two), and nearly 90 percent of them graduate. They might be rewarded with termination of their probation, fewer hours of community service, or reduced fines. Court officials hold a graduation ceremony for each class, and distribute diplomas and special awards donated by community groups, including a tuition scholarship to a local community college. The graduates, all wearing white shirts and black ties, often will pause to thank Redd for being tough on them and convincing them they could make it.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"You can see the care in him," says Kathy Bond, the county's chief probation officer. "You see that hard-nosed soldier, but then you see that other side of him, too -- that compassionate person that really wants to help somebody." That's a combination most of these men have rarely glimpsed before. Many grew up with no father in the home. Some live with cousins or grandmothers or on the streets. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	They're usually surprised when Redd offers to take them to church, or out to breakfast, or to help arrange a job interview, or negotiate their sentence with the district attorney. Near the end of one session, Redd has the men stand and explain what they've gotten out of the program so far. Says one boy, "For once the system is not working against me, but working for me."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Straight talk about responsibility and respect, physical discipline that reinforces basic life skills, and a caring but hard-as-nails authority figure -- could that be a formula for breaking the cycle of juvenile crime?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"I think it can be duplicated," says Judge Goodson, "but it's going to take a person that is just as tough . . . and just as committed as Roger Redd." Cumberland County doesn't spend a dime on the program: Redd takes no money for directing the effort, works during his off-hours, uses no county facilities, and asks the local Chamber of Commerce to donate uniforms as needed. By keeping hundreds of offenders out of jail, he calculates, he saves the county $41 a day, or about $6.5 million over the last five years.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Says Judge Johnson: "Roger's experiment here could be contagious." The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that at least 520,000 of the nation's juveniles are placed on probation each year. With numbers like that, we should hope for an epidemic.<p><i><b>Joe Loconte</b> is the deputy editor of</i> Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship.

<h2>Bellwethers of Realignment</h2>
<b>By Bernadette Malone</b>
</center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Will the surprise election of a Republican majority in the 104th Congress prove to be the first cannonball fired in a full-scale conservative revolution in the federal government, or merely a brief surgical strike to redirect an overreaching president's imprudent agenda? That question, of course, will be determined by the historians.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Regardless of the outcome of the congressional races this November, state legislatures around the country are providing an irrefutable case for an emerging nationwide trend toward a conservative governing philosophy of traditional values, free-market solutions, and smaller government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Eighteen state legislative chambers have switched from Democratic to Republican control since the 1994 election -- either by direct election or their legislators' party-switching. (One of these, the Wisconsin senate, reverted back to Democratic rule, but only after a Republican senator was recalled by voters for his support of a tax increase.)<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On the national level, conservatism and its standard bearers in Congress haven't had an easy year. Many voters who were enamored of the ideas of Republican candidates in November 1994 are expressing doubt to pollsters that the person they voted for should remain in office in 1997.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But the important thing to remember is that the left's attack on the 104th Congress has focused on the messenger of conservative government -- House Speaker Newt Gingrich -- and not the message. To their apparent advantage in polls, challengers to conservative members of congress lambaste their opponents' allegiance to the vilified and unpopular Speaker.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This tactic won't work in state legislative races, where most conservative candidates have never met Gingrich, much less voted with him. State office-seekers are able to separate themselves from the government shutdowns and default threats that haunt many of their federal counterparts and concentrate on the local issues that characterize the devolution of Big Government.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Here are the key states to watch on November 5th for evidence of the conservative agenda's progress:<p>	<center><b>Florida</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Jeb Bush doesn't think it's necessarily the big changes in this state that highlight Florida's growing conservatism. "It's just a continued, constant march towards changing the relationship of government to the people," explains Bush, who came within 2 percentage points of defeating Lawton Chiles for the governorship in 1994. This past legislative session marks the first time since Reconstruction that Florida's senate is Republican-controlled. And come November, the house will go the way of the senate if the GOP can capture three seats. They are very optimistic: 11 of the 12 representatives retiring this year are Democrats, and most are from districts that Bush, the son of President George Bush, carried over Chiles in his narrow loss.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The mainstay of the Democrats' re-election strategy is their no-new-taxes votes and a record of holding growth in the state budget to only 2 percent this session, reports Susan McManus, a professor of public administration and political science at the University of South Florida. "Florida, like the nation at large, has become more conservative over the years," McManus wrote in a recent paper.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"There's no question Florida is shifting to the right, both philosophically and in terms of party registration," says John Smith, the vice president of the James Madison Institute, in Tallahassee. He cites as examples Florida's stringent welfare bill, which is currently awaiting approval from the federal government; tough crime measures; and a new charter-school system. If Republicans take the senate, a school-voucher bill that died during this session has an excellent chance of passage.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Most indicative of the conservatism blossoming in Florida is the slowing of the state spending machine. Since 1983, Smith says, state spending increases averaged $2.4 billion a year. But spending increases in the two most recent budgets have averaged just $500 million. According to Smith, the 1994 state and federal elections and the spending-cap amendment Floridians voted for (also in 1994) are responsible for this encouraging trend.<p><center><b>Iowa</b></center>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The 1994 electoral tidal wave washed over Iowa's lower chamber, enlarging the Republicans' 51-49 majority to 63-37, but it left the senate in Democratic control by a margin of 27-24. Will the November election be a victory for conservatives in the senate?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"It will give them a Republican majority -- but not a conservative influence. That will probably take another election cycle," admits Secretary of State Paul Pate, a Republican and a rising prospect for the governorship. (Governor Terry Branstad is not seeking re-election in 1998.) As a member of the senate from 1989 until 1994, Pate struggled to shepherd conservative bills through his own Republican caucus. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But Pate is confident that some of the Republican candidates running to replace retiring Democrats are solid conservatives who will advance the ball next session. The death penalty, parental notification for minors seeking abortions, and regulatory relief are some major issues Iowa conservatives have been pushing, and all have been obstructed by the Democratic senate.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"The senate was the roadblock to getting any tax cuts at all," says Robert Solt, the research director of Iowans for Tax Relief, of the past legislative session. Under GOP rule, the House introduced an income-tax reduction bill that was supported by Branstad, but thwarted by the more liberal senate. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Eventually the senate compromised and passed a property-tax relief bill. Pointing to this year's state budget surplus of $200 million (compared to 1992's $400 million debt), Solt sees ample opportunity for tax cuts next session if Republicans capture the senate. And Pate cites capital gains and inheritance-tax relief as top priorities of the next legislative session, provided Republicans pick up two senate seats and majority control.<p><center><b>Maine</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Bethel Furniture Stock, located near Maine's border with New Hampshire, makes wood parts for furniture. Leon Favreau is the firm's president and part owner. Although he doesn't consider himself a conservative, he remarks that the country, and especially Maine, have grown more conservative over recent years. His biggest concern of late is a referendum put on the state ballot by environmentalists that would outlaw the harvesting of trees throughout most of the state. "It has the possibility of forcing our operation to close overnight," he says.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In a state supposedly growing more conservative, how does this threat to the economy gain so much steam? Freshman state representative Lisa Lumbra, a Maine native, explains that residents of the state tend to mind their own business, so the governing is usually left to liberal activists. But a bill passed by the state legislature in 1993 granting special rights to homosexuals served as a wakeup call. A recount after the 1994 election turned control of the senate over to the GOP, and left Republicans in the house one seat shy of a majority.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Lumbra is worried that the senate will not be able to retain its control with the retirement of two conservative stalwarts, but the chances of her party becoming the majority in the house are high. Even as the minority party, house Republicans were able to stop funding for a Goals 2000 bill, pass a 15 percent tax cut pending a budget surplus, and stop a $12 million state health program that covered family planning but not hospitalization costs.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But even if Republicans lose the senate, "the conservative trend will be obvious," Lumbra predicts. There are a few conservative Democrats who will be instrumental in passing a tax cut independent of a budget surplus, deregulating the tree-harvesting industry, and scaling down the state's intrusive Department of Human Services, which Lumbra cites as her constituents' top complaint. Leon Favreau might not consider himself a conservative, but he is voting Republican this year.<p><center><b>Nevada</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Serious welfare reform, mirroring Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson's plan, was stalled in the assembly this year after votes on the bill were cast entirely along party lines. It tied 21-21. In its place, the assembly passed a welfare bill authorizing more money for employment programs and counseling.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Republicans and Democrats have shared the chairmanship over the assembly chamber, which was brought to parity in the 1994 election. All but one of the six representatives retiring this year are Democrats, however, and Republican registration in the state exceeded 50 percent this year for the first time. If all goes as planned, it's round two in Nevada for real welfare reform. Republicans will retain their majority in the senate.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even if Republicans are unable to take the chamber, "there may be enough external pressure from the president's signature on the federal welfare bill for Democrats to support statewide reform," says Judy Cresanta, the president of the Nevada Policy Research Institute.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Cresanta also thinks that a Republican assembly would take a crack at nepotism in the teachers union and pass property-rights legislation, a winner with voters in a state where 80 percent of the land is owned by the federal government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And there's good news for Nevadans on the economic front, too. Carol Vilardo, the president of the Nevada Taxpayers' Association, says, "This is the first year we didn't have to go in [to the legislative session] looking to raise taxes." That's because in the 1991 session, the legislature put an end to automatic spending increases for the coming year based on last year's revenues. This is the first year the new policy's effects were felt.<p><center><b>North Carolina</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The booming Research Triangle and Charlotte metropolitan areas have attracted many urban Yankees over the past decade, which would lead one to assume that the land of Jesse Helms has taken on a liberal tinge. But judging from the size of the gains Republicans made in the general assembly and state senate in 1994 (when they took over the assembly and wound up two seats shy of a majority in the senate), one is prompted to reconsider.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Grassroots Research, a Charlotte-based public opinion company, recently conducted a poll of 500 registered North Carolina voters and found that 81 percent disapprove of the race-based admissions standards at the University of North Carolina, 76 percent favor a constitutional amendment for congressional term limits, and 74 percent believe that someone who earns twice as much as they do should pay no more than twice as much in taxes. This same sample of voters splits its support between Democratic challenger Harvey Gantt and Republican incumbent Jesse Helms in this year's U.S. Senate race. That indicates that, while North Carolinians have doubts about a person associated with conservative ideas this November, they cling faithfully to a conservative agenda.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"The trend in North Carolina to be more fiscally conservative and certainly more conservative all around has extended to the Republican Party," observes senate Minority Leader Betsy Cochran. She foresees her party capturing a slim majority in the senate this fall. If so, a pilot program for school vouchers has an good chance of passage, tough welfare reform will be introduced, and quite possibly, affirmative action will be addressed in a "methodical, deliberative manner," she says. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These plans depend on Republicans retaining their majority in the Assembly, and at this point "it's very difficult to predict with any accuracy what's going to happen," says John Hood, the president of the John Locke Foundation, a think tank in Raleigh. Hood wonders whether Republicans can effectively make the case for their election to the public, given the popularity that Democratic governor Jim Hunt has won by cutting taxes after the 1994 elections jolted the legislature. If they really want to distinguish themselves from Democrats, Hood says, they need to go after affirmative action. They just might.<p><center><b>Washington</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"I know every state claims to be the most liberal in the nation, but we've proved it over the years," laughs Bill Baldwin, the president of the Washington Institute for Policy Studies. But with the prospect of property-tax reduction and regulatory and welfare reform sailing through the legislature next session, Washington is looking a lot different these days.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	When asked about his state's facelift, Senator Dan McDonald, the majority leader, suggests it's "probably because the last million to million and  a half people who have moved to Washington state are more conservative than the people who were their predecessors." He cites an increase in the number of suburban voters and social conservatives in his state as reasons for this trend.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1994, when Republicans picked up 25 house seats (a phenomenon widely attributed to the popularity of the term-limits movement), it was their biggest proportional legislative gain in the country. They control the house 62-36, and are only one seat away for a majority in the senate. Baldwin is optimistic that the policies his think tank endorses will be enacted next year, because twice as many Democrats as Republicans are retiring from the senate this year.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Washingtonians will also elect a governor this year, and if it's a Republican, says Baldwin, there is a good chance that the GOP will be able to repeal the state labor law and start privatizing some of its services. What would another Democratic governor do to Baldwin's agenda? "We'll just put referendum clauses on a lot of these things, bypass the governor, and bring these issues straight to the people," says McDonald.<p><center><b>Wisconsin</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The 1994 gains made by the GOP suffered a setback when Republican state senator George Petak was recalled for breaking his promise and voting for a tax increase to fund a sports stadium. The GOP lost its fragile one-seat majority, and now the GOP must protect the assembly and take back the senate. Before Petak's recall, this legislative session's reform-minded agenda had attracted national attention. Governor Tommy Thompson's rise to the vice presidential short-list was due almost entirely to the welfare reform bill passed by the legislature. "Welfare reform never would have come up for a vote under a Democratically controlled legislature . . . but the final vote was overwhelmingly supportive," says Mary Jo Pauke of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another issue that never would have been addressed is abortion, but under the Republican leadership parental-consent and waiting-period laws were passed into law. Pretty ambitious for one term, but conservatives aren't content to rest on their laurels.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"For the first time in Wisconsin, people are actually going to see their tax bill go down," notes Steve Baas, the communications director for Assembly Majority Leader Scott Jensen. Republicans are campaigning on a $1-billion tax-relief package as next session's legislative centerpiece that would protect the property-tax cut passed this year, eliminate the marriage penalty in the Wisconsin tax code, give working families a tax credit, implement a supermajority rule for tax increases, and provide a 100 percent capital-gains exemption for family farms and business.

<h2>Shalom for At-Risk Youth</h2>
<b>By Heidi Goldsmith</b>
</center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Americans across the political spectrum are talking about the value of boarding schools for poor children from broken families and violent neighborhoods. They say we need more residential schools like Piney Woods Country Life School in Mississippi, Boys Town in Nebraska, and the Milton Hershey School, Girard College, and Scotland School for Veterans' Children in Pennsylvania. Despite their troubled families and neighborhoods, the vast majority of students from these schools graduate and go on to college, the military, or jobs.  <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The major barriers to opening new residential schools are high costs and scarce funds. Annual per-student costs range from around $22,000 at Piney Woods, Girard, and the Job Corps, to $45,000 at others. The creators of a few residential charter schools on the drawing board anticipate annual costs of approximately $26,000 per student. <p>

 <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Israel's network of 70 children and youth villages offers a model for successful and modestly priced residential schools. Residential education is more widely available in Israel than anywhere else: About 7 percent of Israeli youth attend these schools, at a cost of $6,500 to $9,000 per year. Israel's system comprises child-centered communities for "normal" children who have troubled home environments. The message to the students is, "What your family cannot provide you, the community will." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Based on a hybrid of the European boarding schools and the "kibbutz" (communal settlement), Israel's residential education system began in 1933, when thousands of Jewish children were rescued from the Holocaust in Europe and brought to what would become the State of Israel. Special residential schools were created to care for these young, traumatized refugees. Since then, these schools have adapted to the changing demographics and needs of young Israelis who, for various reasons, lack sufficient support from their families. Many of Israel's top politicians (including Shimon Peres), artists, military heroes, and business executives are graduates of these schools. Roughly half the students today are neglected or abused Israelis born in Israel. The other half are new immigrants, mainly from the former Soviet Union and Ethiopia. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Costs are lower in Israel than in America in part because staff salaries are approximately one-third of comparable U.S. salaries. But Israeli youth villages are less expensive also because they are burdened by fewer regulations than American schools. The typical residential student-to-staff ratio in Israel is 10:1; the ideal is 6:1. The norm for residential care in the United States is 4:1, though in some states and programs it is 1:1. Israeli youth villages tend not to have psychological counselors or social workers on staff, as is often required by state regulations in this country. They do not have to provide two adults during the night for every 12 youths, as required by many states. Nor must they hire registered nurses or residential supervisors with Licensed Social Worker degrees (LICSWs), unlike American facilities that wish to qualify for funding from programs such as Medicaid. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"We use psychology, not psychologists; child development theory, not social workers," says Zvi Levy, the director of WIZO-Hadassim Youth Village, near Netanya, Israel. He focuses on developing a child's abilities, not offering therapy for her problems. Instead of "experts" with degrees in counseling, Levy likes to hire positive role models -- adults, usually married, who have served in the military, who have finished high school and usually college, who naturally relate well to the students. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Levy's youth village has 45 residential staff for 500 students. "Too many staff means too much structure," he says. Students' input and assistance is therefore needed and encouraged. The village has two rules for both staff and students: Never hurt anyone, physically or emotionally, and attend school. Students otherwise have enormous freedom to plan their free time. Instead of devising programs specific to each student, the school sets goals and provides a simple, well-planned environment with strong community norms where students learn to navigate the setting at their own speed. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fewer regulations does not mean less accountability. The real measure of whether these programs are effective comes years later: Are graduates employed, taxpaying citizens? Have they formed healthy relationships and created strong families? Using these measures, a 25-year study by the University of Haifa concluded the villages were very effective. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Israeli youth villages are largely funded by the equivalent of voucher programs. The Ministry of Education pays to a residential school what it would otherwise pay for a student's education elsewhere. The residential component is paid to the school by either the Ministry of Welfare or The Ministry of Immigration. Private funds supplement the public funds, adding 10 percent to 20 percent of the school budget. American residential schools could benefit from similar flexibility. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Residential schools offer enormous potential for addressing the problems of America's troubled youth. We could have more of them if we applied the community and child development approach, and enjoyed the same flexibility in regulation and funding of Israel's villages.

<h2>EPA Greenmails the States</h2>

<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Here's a statistic that would make Joe Six-Pack wince. The Coors brewery in Golden, Colorado, spills between 18 and 22 million gallons of beer every year as it overfills its cans and bottles to force the air out before they're sealed. That's a foamy runoff of about a six-pack a second. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One man's brewsky, of course, is another man's "volatile organic compound." VOC -- that's how Colorado environmental officials classify the evaporating ethanol given off by all that spilled beer. VOCs can be harmful in large amounts, but until 1993 breweries like Coors were thought to be minor-league emitters of these naturally occurring toxins. <p>
<table width="180" align="right" cellspacing="7" cellpadding="7">

<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But then Coors did something controversial, and increasingly popular among American companies: It tested itself. The company conducted a voluntary self-audit of its operations to see whether they complied with state environmental standards. It discovered that they didn't -- regulators had underestimated the brewery's VOC emissions by a factor of 17 -- and promptly reported its infraction to state environmental authorities.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As a reward for playing the good corporate citizen and turning itself in, Coors was slapped with a record $1-million fine by the Colorado Department of Health. The company protested the fine, arguing that a million bucks was too much to pay for alerting the state to pollution that neither party had known was occurring. The state legislature and Democratic governor Roy Romer agreed, and in 1994 Colorado became the second state in the nation to pass a law to protect the results of self-audits from being used against companies that voluntarily disclose and correct their environmental infractions.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To date, 19 states have passed audit laws -- all of them since 1993 -- and 25 more are considering them. But this surging tide of state innovation is lapping up against a formidable seawall of entrenched federal bureaucratic interests. Officials at the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) and the Justice Department have long been hostile to self-audit laws, and that hostility has recently turned to active sabotage. States that have passed these laws -- as well as those merely considering them -- are being bluntly told that they do so at the risk of losing autonomy over their own environmental programs. Do it our way, the EPA has warned, or don't do it at all. Democratic and Republican state officials recognize this tactic for what it is: blackmail. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the age of reinvented government, rulemaking by the EPA has increased by 20 percent since 1992. Wayne Crews of the <a href="http://www.cei.org/">Competitive Enterprise Institute</a> estimates the cost of environmental regulation at $174 billion this year, a whopping 26 percent of the total regulatory burden on American families.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Self-audits help businesses cut through complex regulations administered by multiple layers of bureaucracy by providing them with a detailed breakdown of their operations, including suspected sources of pollution. As long as these reports remain in-house, they are useful tools that result in greater environmental compliance. But for bureaucrats used to measuring results in terms of the fines and sentences they impose, audit reports are an irresistible temptation to regulate.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In some instances, as with Coors, state or federal regulators subpoena the audit reports themselves. In others, third parties -- typically environmental groups -- use these reports as the basis for class-action lawsuits. As a result, many companies are understandably reluctant to perform a self-audit.States are attempting to overcome this reluctance by providing businesses with assurances that their good deeds will not be used against them. Most state laws protect, or "privilege," audit reports from use against the company in a lawsuit. Many also provide limited immunity from prosecution to companies that promptly report and correct any violations they uncover. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;States love self-auditing because it allows them to replace the old command-and-control regulatory model with one that allows private-sector innovation. Audits are part of a new thinking about regulation that prizes a cooperative private industry over a reactive regulatory bureaucracy, and environmental compliance over punishment. Whereas the old model relied on legions of enviro-cops to enforce the law, the new model does what even the most zealous and well-staffed bureaucracy cannot: detect operational problems before they become environmental hazards.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But for all the same reasons the states love self-auditing, it seems, the feds hate it. Although it cannot cite one case in which an audit-protection law was abused, the EPA has decided that states with audit laws are guilty until proven innocent. Without the benign supervision of our federal regulators, EPA officials tell state governors, you will willfully and intentionally foul your own nests. When New Hampshire was considering an audit law last year, John DeVillars, the chief EPA administrator for that region, warned Governor Steve Merrill that the law might tempt him to relax environmental enforcement and turn his state into a "pollution haven" in order to attract business. Merrill replied that he was offended by the suggestion that he would jeopardize the health of his citizens by ignoring criminal behavior -- and he signed the law.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	When artful persuasion failed to sway the states, federal bureaucrats resorted to a blunter instrument: their power to delegate to -- or withhold from -- the states the authority over environmental programs under the major federal laws. In March 1995, EPA Administrator Carol Browner warned that the passage of state audit laws "would cause environmental programs delegated to states . . . to revert to national control at EPA." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For the 50 states, this was no small matter. Although most major federal environmental statutes allow the states to administer and enforce programs, EPA officials have the ultimate say in when and how that authority is granted. They have not been shy about using it. States that are considering audit laws such as Ohio, Arizona, Florida, and California have received what one official dubbed "nastygrams" from the EPA. Earlier this year, for instance, Arizona was warned in the bluntest terms that passage of its audit law would lead to a denial of the state's authority to run the Clean Air Act permit program. Other states that have audit laws and would also like to be able to issue permits to businesses under the Clean Air Act -- including Texas, Idaho, and Michigan--have been denied that authority by the EPA. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In some states, this "delegation blackmail" approach seems to be working. Audit bills died in the Ohio, Maryland, and California legislatures this year following heavy lobbying by the EPA and environmental groups. Texas state senator Warren Chisum, who sponsored the Texas law as a Democrat but became a Republican this year, said "the EPA threats have certainly played a role in delaying this in other states. Legislators might say these bills are a good deal, but they are not worth bringing down the wrath of the EPA upon the state." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Still, some state officials refused to be cowed. "I think scare tactics in swing districts in an election year can be effective, but I didn't poll anyone," says Arizona state representative Russell Bowers. "It always disturbs me when state law is dictated to us by the feds. But the bill will be back next year."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For others, the Clinton administration's heavy-handed tactics have only increased their resolve. Russell Harding, the director of Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality, has been a leader in organizing states with audit laws to resist federal pressure. Harding has dug in his heels in Lansing every bit as deep as Carol Browner's pumps pierce the terra in Washington, D.C. -- maybe deeper. "We think we have a very balanced, very carefully crafted law," he says. "Our intention is not to change it. If push comes to shove, we'll give them their programs back."

<b>Funds for New Leadership</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	Since 1993, the William H. Donner Foundation, of New York, has granted "New Leadership" fellowships to recognize individuals or groups whose grass-roots efforts to better their communities exemplify the principles of the foundation's "human capital" program. These include self-reliance, entrepreneurialism, personal responsibility, and volunteerism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	This year's winners of the fellowships include: the Reverend Ronald Matlack, of Camden, New Jersey, who established a church on the model of a foreign mission to relieve blight in an urban neighborhood; Carl Elkins, the founder of the Homeless Literacy Project, in New York City; James Robinson, who started a volunteer ambulance corps for youth in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of New York; Terrence Tighe, the founder of an "employability program" that teaches workplace skills and demeanor to K-8 students at an urban Omaha Catholic school; and David Green, the executive director of a network of education services known as the David School for poor families and at-risk youth in Eastern Kentucky. The awards usually amount to $60,000 over three years.

<b>Report Card on Devolution</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The Urban Institute and the Annie E. Casey Foundation have launched an ambitious $20-million project to evaluate the effects of devolution -- or the "New Federalism" -- on social services and communities. The multi-year project aims to answer three major questions about the federal government's efforts to devolve many responsibilities to states and municipalities: (1) How will the New Federalism affect state and local budgets? (2) How will it affect state policy priorities and the delivery of services? (3) How will it affect the behavior and well-being of individuals and families? Researchers at the Urban Institute will track the course of devolutionary policies from legislative bodies all the way down to neighborhoods, and analyze their effects according to a number of statistical indicators of social well-being. These indicators include "health status" (e.g. rates of low-birth-weight births and childhood immunization); "child and youth well-being" (child abuse and neglect, teen pregnancies, and teen deaths, for example); "family well-being" (the number of out-of-wedlock births and children in foster care, to name a few); and "economic security" (for example, poverty levels, number of families receiving public assistance, employment rates, and income growth).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The project may not issue a comprehensive report for at least three years, but will release periodic policy briefs and interim reports.

<h2>What Works</h2>

<b>A Model Principal</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>, Sara Mosle, a contributing writer, describes Brooklyn's Science Skills Center and its controversial principal, Michael Johnson. Science Skills, a high school whose students come from some of New York's most impoverished neighborhoods, was started by Johnson with the help of New Visions for Public Schools, a Manhattan-based organization that works with the Board of Education and the private sector to promote school reform. Johnson, a 45-year-old African American, graduated from Empire State College with a degree in science education. Like many educators involved in the effort to reform New York's public schools, he believes that poor children are being shortchanged by the system. Unlike most "progressive" educators, however, Johnson is convinced that the way to help poor minority students is not by loosening standards, but by tightening them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As a result, Science Skills Center is focused on preparing students to do well on standardized tests, including the New York State Regents exams and the Scholastic Aptitude Tests. At a time when only 20 percent of New York's public-school students receive a Regents diploma, all of Johnson's students -- even those designated as special-education students -- take, and pass, the Regents exam.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Not surprisingly, this has made Science Skills Center extremely popular with New York's parents, many of whose children have to be turned away simply because the school does not have enough space for all the applicants. But "progressive" educators are horrified by Johnson's emphasis on tests, his autocratic style, and his rigorous, back-to-basics curriculum. They think that schools should prepare students for the world as it already exists. "Parents at my school have some very fundamental questions," he observes. "Can my kid read? Can my kid add the grocery bill? Can my kid go to college? Some of my colleagues want to duck those questions and say, 'They're not important.' But we can't just say that we don't believe in measuring our kids against kids in other parts of the city or state, because colleges are making decisions based on those comparisons. . . . Harvard it still looking at scores, so that's what I'm going with."
<p>
<i>* "Scores Count" by Sara Mosle</i>, New York Times Magazine, <i>September 8, 1996</i>.
<p>
<b>A Classical Curriculum</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Gene Edward Veith, dean of arts and sciences at Concordia University, in Wisconsin, writes that too many  proposals to reform America's schools focus on means -- vouchers, technology, teacher certification -- rather than on ends. Although he does not disparage these means, what American education most urgently requires, Veith contends, is a new philosophy of education -- a return to the classical conception of education as the knowledge a person requires to be truly free, and to the classical "trivium" of grammar, logic, and rhetoric. "To be educated in any discipline," he writes, "one must know its basic facts (grammar); be able to think deeply about the subject (logic); and be able to act on that knowledge in a personal, original and independent way (rhetoric)."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Veith cites three examples of how the classical approach to education is being used in primary and secondary schools. The Association of Classical and Christian Schools (ACCS), which currently has 26 member schools, was founded in 1993 by the Reverend Douglas Wilson, a Protestant minister from Idaho, to promote the idea of a Christian education organized around the trivium. In the prototype ACCS school, the Logos School (founded by Wilson in 1980), the primary grades are devoted to acquiring basic knowledge -- reading, arithmetic, patriotic and biblical stories. Middle school and junior high are devoted to "the questioning and probing of reality that is logic."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Finally, the high-school years, ages 15 to 18, are devoted to self-expression, and beginning rhetoric classes use textbooks by Aristotle and Cicero. According to Veith, "The level of discourse, the depth of thinking, and what can only be described as a richness of character set the Logos seniors apart. Such are the benefits of a classical education."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Other attempts to construct an educational philosophy around the classical trivium are the Paideia Project -- used today in some 30 school districts nationwide -- and the Westside Preparatory School in Chicago. These schools help broaden the horizons of thousands of children, including poor children often written off as ineducable.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The classical approach to education is valuable, Veith contends, because it offers a "comprehensive, universal paradigm for learning." In his view, the classical education movement holds the key not only to educational reform but to an educational renaissance in America.

<b>Private Schools and Special Ed</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In <i>Meeting the Challenge</i>, Janet R. Beales, who directs the Reason Foundation's Study Program, points out that, contrary to a widely held myth, public schools do not accept every student. Students that public schools believe they cannot educate are often sent, at public expense, to private schools that specialize in the education of a certain type of student.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Beales distinguishes between three broad categories of difficult-to-educate students who are served by the private sector: "special-education" students are those with mental, physical, emotional, or disabilities. Over 100,000 students, or about 2 percent of the nation's special-education population, currently attend nonpublic schools at the public's expense. (Typically, the private school will operate under contract with government agencies at the local, state, or even federal level).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"At-risk students" include dropouts, teen parents, homeless youth and students with drug problems. School districts in at least 17 states contract with private schools to educate these students. Charter schools -- autonomous, publicly funded schools freed from most state and local regulations -- play an especially large role in serving these students.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Adjudicated students" are juvenile criminals who, under compulsory state education laws, are required to attend school until a certain age. About 35,000 adjudicated youth are housed in 2,000 privately operated facilities, including training centers, ranches, shelters, halfway houses and group homes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Although meaningful comparisons between education outcomes for difficult-to-educate students in public and private schools are currently impossible, given the lack of reliable data, Beales documents the wide variety of learning environments provided by the private sector to deal with such students. These arrangements include residential schools, day schools, charter schools, independent study programs, religious schools, and home schools.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Given this wide variety of options, Beales contends, the commonly heard argument that school-choice policies would turn public schools into a "dumping ground" for the most difficult-to-educate students is simply not credible. On the contrary, a large-scale school-choice program would benefit these students by providing them with a "supply of schools as diverse as the students they are intended to serve." The fact that, even now, private schools already serve many students with special needs, sometimes enrolling the most difficult among them, "lays bare the myth of the public-school dumping ground."

<h2>Cautionary Tales</h2>

<b>Public Schools and Special Ed</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Although the cost of educating a child in New York City's public-school system comes to $8,000 per year, that figure, argues Kay S. Hymowitz in her profile of New York City's "special-ed" schools, is actually quite misleading. A full-time special-ed student costs the city $23,598 per year. A part-time special-ed student costs $10,207 per year. But an ordinary student receives only $5,148 in educational services per year. New York's "regular education system," Hymowitz argues, "resembles a parking lot full of 1968 cars, while special ed is like a handful of shiny new Cadillacs."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	All this might not be so bad if special-ed classes were actually helping their students. But two-thirds of special-ed students exiting the system in 1995, Hymowitz writes, dropped out instead of graduating. Of the remaining third, only half received a diploma that was worth anything.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	New York's special-ed system is a monument to good intentions gone awry. In 1975, Congress passed the All Handicapped Children Act, later called the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Initially, the law called on the federal government to pay 40 percent of the cost of the vast program it had called into being. In fact, today Washington funds a mere 7 percent of the program, leaving New York taxpayers to pay the rest.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The law was based on several assumptions: First, that if a team of experts examined a child, it could evaluate his or her problem with scientific precision; second, that this team of experts, drawing on the latest scientific advances, could devise an effective program to treat the problem; and third, that educators could then successfully implement such a program, no matter what the cost. In fact, Hymowitz points out, the initial assumption was completely wrong: Different teams of experts, evaluating the same child, have issued sharply different diagnoses. And if assumption one is flawed, it follows that the others are unworkable.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Today, more than 60 percent of the children assigned to special-ed programs are classified as "learning disabled," a term so vague and expansive, writes Hymowitz, "that it is a standing invitation to any poorly performing child." Hymowitz believes that a substantial number of "learning disabled" children come from chaotic, problem-ridden families; their deprivation is cultural, not neurological. Yet the law governing special ed specifies that the category "learning disabled" should "not include children who have learning problems which are primarily the result of . . . environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage." In other words, many of the students enrolled in expensive special-ed programs have no right to be there.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But there are powerful political forces blocking reform. Special-ed schools have provided jobs for thousands of psychologists, social workers, and evaluators. As a result, the unions are quite satisfied with the status quo. Parents of handicapped children also seem pleased with New York's special-ed program, and politicians, fearful of being accused of a lack of compassion, are unwilling to antagonize these parents. As a result, a special-education system that costs a great deal, accomplishes very little, and starves regular public schools of badly needed funds appears impervious to reform.

<h2>Thoughts on Civil Society</h2>

<b>Crime's Terrible Toll</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In <i>Body Count</i>, former Secretary of Education <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William J. Bennett</a> and his two co-authors, Princeton criminologist John DiIulio and John P. Walters, the former deputy director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, focus on what they call "superpredators," cruel, cold-blooded, shockingly young men who can and do kill at random, without rhyme, reason, or remorse, and without any fear of retribution. Over the next decade, they predict, the number of such superpredators is bound to increase substantially, leading to an unprecedented crime wave. "America is a ticking crime bomb," they declare, and when it explodes our streets will be inundated with young killers, possibly leading to an "authoritarian backlash" that will undermine our free institutions and bring us "only a short step away from achieving a quasi-police state."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The root cause of predatory street crime, the authors contend, is moral poverty. "By 'moral poverty'," they write, "we mean the poverty of being without loving, capable, responsible adults who teach the young right from wrong. . . . In the extreme, it is the poverty of growing up surrounded by deviant, delinquent, and criminal adults in a perfectly criminogenic environment -- that is, an environment that seems almost consciously designed to produce vicious, unrepentant, predatory street criminals."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Among the causes of moral poverty, Bennett and his co-authors cite the cultural revolution of the 1960s that undermined traditional values and institutions and a welfare system that subsidized illegitimacy and subverts the work ethic. But they pay particular attention to drugs, which, they argue, cause moral poverty by dissolving "the bonds of human and familial ties." By making drug-addicted parents indifferent to everything, including the well-being of their children, drugs sever family members not only from one another, but also from the traditional values of the larger society. Growing up in such families is like being raised by a pack of wolves, and those who survive the ordeal are likely to lack certain character traits -- such as empathy and impulse control -- that we think of quintessentially human.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	From this it follows that if we are serious about eradicating moral poverty, we must conduct an uncompromising war against drugs. The authors of <i>Body Count</i> argue that, contrary to widely-held misconception, America's war on drugs was yielding impressive results until the Clinton administration came into office. Since Clinton's election, however, "the nation has suffered the greatest increase in drug use and the largest expansion in the supply of illegal drugs ever measured." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Besides waging the war on drugs with renewed vigor, eradicating moral poverty requires that we reform our schools and our systems for criminal justice, welfare, and adoption. Most importantly, however, promoting traditional values among young members of the underclass requires the "re-moralization" of our culture through "a widespread renewal of religious faith and the strengthening of religious institutions."
