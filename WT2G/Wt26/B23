<h2>Connectix Color QuickCam</h2></b><br>
<h3>By William Franklin</h3>
<hr>
<p>

A few years ago, Connectix, the people known for RAM Doubler and Speed Disk,  brought
digital imaging to
the masses with its $99 tennis ball-size digital camera, which captured grayscale images and video
from your
desktop. Now Connectix has rolled out an updated version that packs full-scale color into the
same round
package for just $200. The Color QuickCam's image quality can't match that of more expensive
digital cameras
or video-capture cards, but if you need a one-stop, low-cost digital photography and video
solution, it's perfect.<p>

<p>

The Color QuickCam plugs into your keyboard and parallel ports simultaneously. For those of us
who have only
one parallel port and are using a printer, you'll want to invest in a good switch box. Otherwise
you'll be pulling a
cable switcheroo every time you want to use the Color QuickCam. If you're running Windows 95,
also check
your system for port conflicts before installing the unit.<p>

<p>

The Color QuickCam offers a fast, affordable way to capture color images and video from your
desktop. Once
it's plugged in, the Color QuickCam couldn't be easier to use. Like the previous version, the color
unit comes
with two software utilities, QuickPict and QuickMovie. QuickPict captures still, color images at
resolutions of
640 by 480 pixels at up to 24-bit color. Snapshot timing was a problem with the original
QuickCam, so
Connectix added a self-timer to this version. Now a countdown lets you prepare for your close-up
photographs.
QuickMovie records digital video with an equally simple set of controls. <p>

<p>

The Auto Capture features allow you to set the still frame mode to take a snapshot at intervals
you wish and then
save them all to one file. This gives you the ability to use the product as a security unit, use it for
various types of
surveillance monitoring activity or have these snap shots sent to your web pages. In snap shot
mode, you have
the ability to save in either JPEG PICT OR TIFF format. You'll have adjustments in the software
to take
snapshots whenever you want and can even set it to take snap shots on certain days and not
others.<p>

<p>

The original QuickCam lacked a good compression system and captured video at low frame rates.
Connectix
solved that digital dilemma with its Video Digitally Enhanced Compression (VIDEC). This
method lets users
capture up to 24 fps depending on image size. However, if a non-QuickCam user wants to view a
VIDEC-compressed movie, the file has to be decompressed before it's sent, or the user must have
the
decompressor on his or her computer (it's available for download on the Connectix Web site).<p>

<p>

While the image and video tools have improved they could still use some refinement. The size and
resolution of
the video you can capture is limited. Images are sharpest when displayed in the standard
1-inch-by-1-inch
window. You can enlarge the capture window but images become grainy. Instead of using a
camera-based zoom
lens, the Color QuickCam's zoom feature is software based, meaning it has only a few ratios to
choose from.
You can move the Color Quickcam from color back to black and white and you can specify the
number of colors 
you wish to capture ( from millions all the way down to four). For desktop presentations, you'll
find of course
that the maximum amount of color you want to display is 72 colors. <p>

<p>

The Color QuickCam's Web and conferencing features are big strengths, making the camera
compatible with
several videoconferencing programs, including Connectix's VideoPhone software and White Pine's
Enhanced
CU-SeeMe. If you want to broadcast pictures from a Web site, QuickPict includes an improved
Auto Capture
feature that takes pictures at specified intervals. The Color QuickCam also comes with
QuickCards Limited, a
multimedia greeting-card program, as well as an America Online add-on that lets you easily e-mail
images to
other AOL members.<p>

<p>

The Camera itself is about the size of a tennis ball and has a focus on it. It contains a very good
color CCD
camera built into the tennis ball sized housing along with a VIDEC video compression board. The
camera has a
stand you can use and it also has a tripod mount. You'll get a base of 640 X 480 pixel CCD with
up to 24-bit
color. <p>

<p>

The Color QuickCam isn't the ultimate in digital cameras, nor is it a production-quality digital
video device. But
if you need a little of both, the Color QuickCam gives you an eyeful of color digital power at a
terrific price.<p>

<p>

Rumors are saying that in the very near future Connectix plans to come out with a fully
self-contained unit with
color camera, video compression board and micro modem all in one unit so all you'll have to do is
plug the thing
into a telephone line. Once that happens, you'll be in a position to use the software on your
desktop computer,
dial into the remote camera through your telephone line or the net and obtain or download instant
footage from
any location that a unit has been placed.<p>

<title>CD Labeling Kit Is Easy, Creative and Practical</title>

<font color="#800000"><h3>By Craig Crossman</font></h3>

<p><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Recordable CD technology (CDR) has become a lot more affordable. CDR drives are now priced
under $1,000, and prices continue to drop. This is amazing because only two years ago, they sold
for $7,000 and up. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Making your own CD is no longer restricted to the music industry. Business professionals,
lawyers, doctors and small businesses are choosing to develop and publish their own CD. The
advantages are obvious: CDs are accessible,  safe (they can't be erased), and they're a lot cheaper
to produce and ship than comparable manuals and catalogs that contain thousands of pages and
weigh dozens of pounds. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>But what about the label? Floppy disks, removable storage devices (like Zip, SyQuest, Jaz) and
tapes all have labels you can stick on them. But there really hasn't been anything made for the little
CD-ROM disk, until now. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The NeatO CD Labeler kit is an easy system that lets you design, print and apply CD labels to any
CD. Even if you don't have a CDR drive, you will still find NeatO to be a useful addition to your
labeling arsenal. How many times have you forgotten which CD contains that useful collection of
clip art or fonts? A label lets you more easily identify the CD and its contents.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>NeatO contains software templates for the Mac and PC that let you choose from a wide variety of
professionally designed labels you can modify and personalize. They work directly with
PageMaker, FileMaker Pro, QuarkXpress and CorelDraw. NeatO also includes Design Express
for Windows, an application for creating even more CD labels. Using virtually any laser or color
inkjet printer, you can print directly onto the 100 blank labels included in the kit. Additional labels
are available in boxes of 500 for $79.95. After printing, the labels must be aligned perfectly onto
the CD. An off-center label not only looks bad but could make the CD spin off-balance, causing
read errors to occur.

<p> 

<p>The NeatO system includes its patented two-piece labeler tool. Its appearance is pretty strange:
The first piece looks much like a roll of toilet paper standing on its end; the second piece looks
like a small conical spinning top toy with a shaft you hold with your thumb and fingers. But the
tool helps ensure the label's clean fit. The NeatO labeling kit sells for $79.95 and is available from
MicroPatent. MicroPatent (800) 984-9800 or (203) 466-5170 (http://www.neato.com)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Add graphics to your site</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Just as there are collections of clip art for your word processor and graphics programs, Diamar
has come up with a collection of images especially designed for web pages.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Web.pix is a CD collection of 250 royalty-free images for web publications. Each comes in GIF
and JPEG, two of the most common formats used on the Internet web. Web.pix lets you use a
web browser such as Netscape or Explorer to view the images directly from the CD; no
installation is necessary. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In addition to being royalty-free, Diamar's licensing agreement does not require photo credits to
be placed underneath each photo, as other image suppliers require.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Web.pix works for both PC and Mac, and sells for $30. Diamar Interactive Corporation (206)

<title>Mouse Tales: Take Control </title>
</head>
<body text="#000000" link="#0000ff" vlink="#551a8b" alink="#ff0000" 
bgcolor="#ddd9a2">
<h2><strong><font color="#ff0000">Mouse Tales: Take Control</font> </strong></h2>
<h3><strong><font color="#000080">By George Herman</font></strong></h3>

<p><strong><hr>
</strong>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Make it easy to use - that was the goal of the two Steves, Jobs and Wozniak, when they designed
the first Macintosh, and that was a mission that Apple never abandoned. The Mac was not only
easy to use for editing text and building a data base and such, but it was easy to modify its
behavior to suit the user's taste and work habits. That was achieved by using a Control Panel. By
clicks of the mouse, one could adjust the Mac's response to the mouse and the keyboard, the
appearance of the Desktop, and also set the Mac's clock and calendar.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>By the time of System 6, the Control Panel allowed the calling up of several subsidiary control
devices (cdevs). With System 7 the designers faced reality, and now we have a Control Panel
folder (inside the System folder) containing a number of Control Panels, as many as two dozen or
more if you add some of your own. It is no surprise that some of these should be ignored even by
experienced users! There are a few especially worth attention as you first begin to study Control
Panels (or the Control Panel, if you are still using System 6.) Have a look at the General Controls
Panel. Whatever your system number, it will let you control the speed of cursor blinking in text
and the number of blinks by which a menu item confirms that you chose it. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Before you start to play, open a page of text. Click the cursor somewhere in the middle of the
text, so that you might have to search for it if you forgot where it was. Now open the General
Controls Panel (or the General Controls section of the Control Panel in System 6 or earlier). You
can set the Cursor's blinking rate to Fast, Medium, or Slow by clicking the appropriate little radio
button. Try the slowest speed, and look for the cursor in the text. When you have found it, move
it by clicking somewhere else, open the control panel, set it to the fastest speed, and try again.
Most people find the fast-blinking cursor noticeably easier to locate. If you have sometimes typed
your last word in the middle of the document because you have forgotten that the cursor was not
at the end, this may help. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Now experiment with menu blinking. Open a folder window, any folder that is not empty. In the
General Controls panel, you may choose to have the menu item blink (from black on white to
white on black) zero, one, two, or three times. Each time you make a choice, click on the folder
window and choose something different from the View menu. Most people feel very uncertain
that the menu selection has worked if it does not blink at least twice, but you may suit your own
taste. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you are in system 6, the same control panel will allow you to set the date and time. If you are
using System 7, you will find a separate control panel, called, of all things, Date &amp; Time. Changes
are made part by part. For example, to change the hour when entering or leaving Daylight Savings
Time, click on the hour showing in the control panel. It will be highlighted and a pair of little
arrows will appear nearby. If you can't guess what they do, try them, one at a time. They allow
small adjustments to be easy. If you have moved across the world and want to change by four or
five hours, you can just type the new time while the old one is highlighted. This will also be the
easiest approach after the Mac's battery (which preserves the memory of time and date when the
power is off) has died and been replaced. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>There are more control panels - too many for this issue. They are all safe to explore on your own,
but in a future column I'll talk about some I enjoy. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>ERROR CODE 3</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>That's the error code that translates to Uninstalled - trying to use something that is not there. I'll
use it as a title for things I have overlooked that someone has been kind enough to point out to
me. For example, M. J. Shadowen reminded me that it is sometimes possible to get a frozen Mac 

<p>gracefully back into normal operation by forcing the frozen application to quit. A forced quit is
managed from the keyboard, so it does not matter if the Mac is not responding to the mouse. The
command is given by holding down both the Option and the Command key and pressing Escape
(esc). Sometimes that will get the frozen application out of the way and the Mac back to normal,
but remember that Mr. Shadowen and I both said "sometimes."

<font color="#800080"><h3>By Bill Franklin</font></h3>

<p><hr>

<p> 

<p>Has your mouse been sticking as it slides it across the mouse pad lately, kind of like its gummed
up or something similar? Are your cursor movements a little shaky sometimes? Are you thinking
it's time to buy a new mouse? Well read on then. Maybe this tip on mouse maintenance will help.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Just like their four-legged little namesakes, the electronic mouse isn't always clean.  As they roll
around, the mouse can pick up dust and oils that you and I don't see. As the debris accumulates,
movement can become jittery, jumpy or shaky. If your mouse does start displaying these sorts of
problems, don't run out and plunk down your hard-earned cash for a new one just yet. Your
mouse may only need a good cleaning to get it up and running again. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Clean my mouse you say! How hard is that? It's not hard at all actually. It's a very simple process
that can save you some money and make your mouse perform better. The first step is to turn off
your computer. You do not need to unplug the mouse to perform this maintenance. O.K., now
turn the mouse upside down. You should now see a circular ring or panel around the, pardon the
expression, mouse ball. You will need to remove this ring. Turn or slide the panel (some twist,
some slide) in the direction the arrows point, turn the mouse upside down, and the ball will fall
out. Catch it, don't let it bounce on the floor!

<p> 

<p>Take a look inside the mouse. You should see two or three rollers.  One makes the pointer move
up and down.  One makes the pointer move left and right.  The third one (if present) holds the ball
against the first two.  You will probably see some dust or dirt  all over the rollers. These contacts
can get really gunked up and crusty. When this happens, they don't roll smoothly and in turn the
little ball doesn't glide freely on your mouse pad. If this is the case, you need to get these rollers
really clean.  I've found that a couple of toothpicks work well to scrape out the dust that has
twisted itself around the rollers. A dry cotton swab also works pretty well for cleaning the surface
of the rollers (do not, I repeat, do not use anything wet inside your mouse!). Make sure to get all
of the dirt from around the edges of the rollers out.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the ball is dirty or sticky, clean it with some warm soapy water and dry it completely. Once dry,
put it back it inside the mouse. Now re-assemble the mouse by sliding or placing the ring back on
it's track and turning it in the direction to close it.  Rub his belly before you turn him over.  They
like that! 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Now that your rodent has taken a bath you need to keep him clean.  Keep the desk dusted and use
a plastic laminated mouse pad rather than a cloth covered one.  The dust collects in the weave of
the cloth pads and you'll have to start cleaning again.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Hope this helps

<title>Mac Energy Savers</title>
</head>
<body text="#000000" link="#0000ff" vlink="#551a8b" alink="#ff0000" 
bgcolor="#ddd9a2">
<font color="#ff0000"><h2><strong>Mac Energy Savers</strong></font></h2>
<h3><strong><font color="#ff0000"></strong>By Tif Bailey<strong></strong></font></h3>

<p><strong><hr>
</strong>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Now that frost is on the pumpkin and the leaves have fallen (<em>Editor's Note Tif is writing to us
from Albany, NY where winter is in full-force</em>), thoughts may turn to saving household or office
power consumption. What do Macs offer in the way of power conservation? System 7.5+ offers
five different energy-related control panels. Fortunately, Apple and the system installers pre-load
the appropriate control panel for specific Mac models. Any other combinations may lead to
surprise shutdowns. A Mac that goes into sleep mode while downloading a file from the internet
would not be helpful.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The five energy-related control panels from Apple are:

<p>Screen version 1.0.7

<p>Auto Power On/Off version 1.0

<p>CPU Energy Saver version 1.0

<p>Energy Saver version 1.0

<p>Energy Saver version 2.0.2

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Here is what they do:

<p><em>Screen</em> is used on some Macs with a built-in monitor to control brightness and contrast. It also
allows control to automatically "sleep" the internal monitor after a specified period of inactivity
(15-60 minutes) 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Auto Power On/Off</em> allows the Mac to automatically shut down after a specified idle time, reboot
after a power failure, and/or start up or shut down at a certain time(s). 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>CPU Energy Saver</em> allows a Mac to turn off at a specific time or after a specified amount of idle
time. It does not allow a Mac to start up at a specific time.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Energy Saver 1.0</em> allows an external monitor to go into sleep mode after a specified idle time. It is
usually supplied with an "Energy Star"-compliant monitor. Literally, the monitor may sleep but
the CPU is active and the hard drive will be spinning.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Energy Saver 2.0.2</em> is actually an application, and requires the "Energy Saver Extension" to
function. This application utility combines the features of CPU Energy Saver, Energy Saver 1.0
and Auto Power On/Off. It allows shut down of the system after a specified idle time (with
separate settings for the monitor and hard drive), set the system to start up or shut down at
specific times (and days), auto-save open document before a scheduled shut down (and open them
up again on start up), and restart automatically after a power failure. The sleep mode used by
Energy Saver 2 is similar to the sleep mode on PowerBooks, in that the entire system "goes to
sleep" instead of just the monitor.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To determine which control panels are appropriate for which models use the Apple Guide, click
on the question mark box in the upper right corner of the screen. If "energy saving" is not listed as
a topic try doing a key-word search on "energy". No information in the Apple Guide means that
no energy saving control panel was provided with that Mac model or that the revision of the
system software does not support it. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>The Apple Guide</em> provides information on settings for the control panels. Most have a fairly strait
forward window for specifying performance options. However, the Energy Saver settings are not
stored in a preference file or in the control panel itself, but rather in PRAM, because PRAM is the
only way a Mac can keep information in memory when it is turned off. This is how the computer
keeps track of time. It is important because if you simply "disable" the Energy Saver control panel
and extension, the settings will still be in effect. In order to disable the Energy Saver functions,
first change the settings to "never" using the control panel/application, then disable the extension.

<p>Like an alarm clock, a Mac can be set to turn on just before normal working hours. Shut down
after a specific period of idleness, (no key strokes or mouse moves). A Mac might be programed
to collect e-mail on week-ends or perform backup operations after hours. There are devices for
turning on Macs when the phone rings in order to receive a fax or be accessed via a remote
computer. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Waking up a sleeping Mac can be done by tapping the Power Switch or hitting a benign key such
as a curser direction key or a mouse move. Energy saving features may already be a part of your
Mac and are worth exploring.

<h2>CrypEdit: The Best Encryption Software For Windows</h2></b><br>
<h3>By Fred Katt</h3>
<hr>
<p>

CrypEdit is an extremely useful utility program for anyone who wants to safeguard valuable
&amp; sensitive information,
e-mail, documents, and data files stored on computers and disks, and sent through computer
networks and the
Internet. Almost all computers and networks provide many different methods of limiting access to
information.
Unfortunately, hackers, unhappy employees, and competitors have been known to find ways of
defeating these
safeguards; stealing data and wrecking havoc on the system. Even the Central Intelligence
Agency's web site was
the recent victim of hackers who rewrote pages and deleted data. A program like CrypEdit offers
a viable solution
to the unauthorized viewing and use of information, e-mail, documents, and data files.<p>

<p>

Before you say, "but, why do I need a program like this, I'm not the CIA," hear me out. There are
many reason why
an encryption program is needed by almost every user. With the increased use of E-mail by both
businesses and
individuals, many important documents are now being sent over the Internet. As Internet usage
goes up, so does the
number of those trying to make a buck on stealing information. As an example, let's say you
needed to send the latest
sales reports for your district to the main office by E-mail. Did you know that your E-mail goes
through many points
in its transfer from your computer to its recipient; much like a letter being sent that must stop at
different Post Office
facilities before reaching its destination. At each and every point along the route that your E-mail
was transferred,
the possibility exists for hackers to break in and view that message. <p>

<p>

Other examples of why you need encryption software include: The protection of files on your
hard drive from prying
eyes (like your coworker who needs that next big idea you're working on to impress the boss, or
keeping the risque
note you sent to the secretary you're having an affair with from winding up the talk of the morning
coffee break);
Safeguard for your files when you're traveling (forgetting a disk containing a crucial presentation
or blue print at the
hotel bar, and seeing the competition come out with your product the following week won't go
too far to helping
your career); General protection from any and all outside sources, unless you want them to view it
(let's say you
want to sell data to someone but need to make sure they pay for it before they have access, use of
an encryption
password would allow for this option).<p>

<p>

There are many encryption software products on the market but CrypEdit, from Genio USA, is
far and away one
of the best. It's so easy to use that most operations are just a mouse click away. The program is
available for
Windows 95, Windows 3.1 and 3.11, Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT.  It ships on
3.5" disks and is very
easy to install and configure; and best of all, it only takes 1MB of disk space on your hard drive.
A paltry amount
compared to the security and piece of mind CrypEdit will give you.<p>

<p>

The program has a built in multi-document editor which enables people to create, edit, and view
text documents. This
allows Text documents to be stored on any disk as plain or encrypted text or sent as encrypted
e-mail via CrypEdit's
Microsoft Mail and Exchange interface. You can also attach any file encrypted by CrypEdit to an
e-mail message
for secure transmission. Only those people who know the passwords, or have been assigned a
password key
relationship in the same "Key-Set" file, may successfully decrypt the encrypted e-mail, document,
and files. <p>

<p>

You can also compress encrypted text documents before encryption to reduce storage space,
decrease transmission
time, and increase security even more. Encrypted text documents can also be saved in UU
encoded format via a menu
command. CrypEdit also supports drag and drop operations for encrypted and plain text
documents so to open a file,
or a whole group of files for editing or viewing all you have to do is select them in File Manager
or the Windows 95
Explorer and drag them onto the active CrypEdit program window. Creating a new document,
opening a document,
saving a document, and e-mailing is just a mouse click away via toolbar buttons.<p>

<p>

CrypEdit lets a user deliver, on disk or via e-mail, work or products in encrypted digital form and
give the passwords
to the recipient after the agreement is completed. This is perfect for storing, viewing, creating,
editing, delivering,
and e-mailing legal and financial papers, personal letters, engineering abstracts, journals, scripts,
books, marketing
plans, memos, articles, business plans and proposals, and confidential correspondence. <p>

<p>

Unlike the simple encryption options in programs like WordPerfect or MS Word, that allow you
to password protect
a single file, CrypEdit lets you encrypt or decrypt any single file or you can encrypt or decrypt a
whole directory,
whole directory trees, or complete disks of files per a filename wildcard specification. Files can
also be compressed
before encryption to make your encrypted files more secure, and are automatically decompressed
after decryption.
Again, all of these operations are done with a simple mouse click via the easy to use Toolbar
buttons.<p>

<p>

Users can send encrypted text documents and attached encrypted files using Microsoft Mail and
Exchange via the
"Send" button or menu option within CrypEdit to one person or whole groups of users on the
local network or
anywhere in the world using the Internet. CrypEdit uses Private Key encryption so that those that
use it are in
complete and total control of the security of their e-mail, documents, and files. They are solely
responsible for the
origin, integrity, and security of the passwords(keys)  used for encryption and decryption. <p>

<p>

CrypEdit includes a complete system to create, edit, and use encrypted Private Key-Set files so
you can assign access
to e-mail, documents, and files per a user's security level or per individual e-mail, document, or
file. Key-Set files are
stored encrypted on disk in the computer's memory using 1 or 2 passwords of the KeyMaster's
choice. After opening
a Key-Set file a person selects their user ID and enters their password to use the Key-Set file.<p>

<p>

Private Key-Set files makes the decryption of messages, documents, and files a simple one step
process: open the
e-mail or document, or select the file, or specify the directory or directory tree to decrypt, and
CrypEdit will
automatically use the appropriate OLE document server, to use with Word, Excel &amp;amp;
Exchange. <p>

<p>

CrypEdit is an OLE server program, (Object Linking and Embedding). This lets a user embed
encrypted messages,
notes, or documents within an OLE program's file such as Word or Excel. Embedded OLE
encrypted documents
can also be cut, pasted, and copied to and from the Windows clipboard.<p>

<p>

CrypEdit has built in utilities accessible via the menu or toolbar buttons to secure delete any single
file, or whole
directories or directory trees and thus whole disks of files per filename wildcard arguments. A
"Secure Deleted" file
will be overwritten 5 times with pseudo random data values (this forces compressed file systems
to write all the
overwriting data over the file), truncated to zero length, renamed to one character if possible, and
finally deleted. This
means that no one will be able to undelete a secure deleted file from your system.<p>

<p>

CrypEdit comes with utilities to UU encode and decode files (a type of file protocol used for
sending data over the
Internet) as well as utilities that will split up UU encoded files into some user specified maximum
sized parts and to
rebuild those split up UU encoded files. Encrypted editor documents can also be automatically
saved in UU encoded
format via an all in one menu command. <p>

<p>

CrypEdit comes with a Windows Help file which functions as an electronic on-line manual; it is
almost an exact copy
of the printed manual.<p>

<p>

I hope that I have not totally confused you, and you're wondering what all of the stuff I wrote
about really means.
The gist of the article is that CrypEdit is a fine encryption program for Windows that is very easy
to understand and
use. Sure you're not a spy and the cold war is over, but remember there are those out there
lurking about ready to
take whatever little bit they can from you. Why give them the opportunity when you can use a
simple, inexpensive
program like CrypEdit to slam the window on their prying eyes and make them look elsewhere for
their next victim.
The protection is available, all you need do is use it.<p>

<title>Changes In Encryption Technology Regulations Are
Sought</title>

<font color="#0000ff"></font><font color="#000080"><h2><strong>Changes In 
Encryption Technology Regulations Are Sought</font></strong></h2>

<p><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A bipartisan group of federal legislators is calling for the Clinton administration to loosen
restrictions on the export of encryption technologies. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In October, 20 Senate and House members sent a letter to Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor to
"express our serious concern about the administration's most recent announcement on export
restrictions on encryption technology." The 4 Democrats and 16 Republicans said the policy,
announced October 1, is too restrictive. The legislators worry that the policy will do more harm
than good to American companies. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon), who organized the anti-encryption campaign, "fundamentally
believes that efforts to limit trade in encryption technologies is harmful to American businesses,
harmful to American workers, harmful to the trade balance, and do not in fact do anything to
improve national security," spokesman Jeffrey Nelson said. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The administration's encryption plan allows for the export of slightly more powerful encryption
than what had previously been legal, with one major proviso: that the numerical keys that unlock
the encryption code are kept by a third, nongovernmental party. Law enforcement officials would
only be allowed access to the keys with a court order. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The legislators' letter criticizes the policy on several points: "It fails to recognize that top-down,
government-imposed policies are doomed to defeat," the letter states. "Export policies must be
directly linked, or indexed to advances in technology [and] export controls must be fully
multilateral in order to be effective." 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The letter further criticizes the policy for "granting the FBI veto authority over U.S. exports." 

<p>But the administration defends its plans, saying the criticisms are unfounded.  Heidi Kukis, Vice
President Al Gore's spokeswoman said today that the president, not the FBI, is the only one who
has veto power over the export of encryption. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>She added that the government itself will not hold the key but will have access to it with a court
order, much like the government can get access to telephone lines through a court order to "track
down criminals and terrorists."  She also argued that the new policy in fact loosens, rather than
tightens export restrictions. Previously, the State Department had jurisdiction over encryption and
classified it as a "munition," which made it much more difficult to export, Kukis said. Now it is
being placed under the jurisdiction of the Commerce Department, where it is categorized as a
"duel use technology" for civilian or defense uses, a much less restrictive classification, she said. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Not all are opposed to the policy. In fact, an alliance of 11 software and hardware makers have
banded together to develop the key-recovery solutions for which the Clinton administration's plan
called.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The administration's plan gives exporters of encryption or encrypted software a two-year window
starting January 1, 1997, to build what the administration calls "key recovery" into their products.
IBM, Apple Computer, Atalla, Digital Equipment, Groupe Bull, Hewlett-Packard, NCR, RSA
Data Security, Sun Microsystems, Trusted Information Systems, and United Parcel Service have
banded together to develop systems that will give the government what it wants, which is access
to suspicious encrypted messages, so that compliant software companies will be able to get export
licenses for hard-to-crack encryption codes. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>"The federal government has never dictated how the key recovery system will be billed," Kukis
added. "That is up to the industry. What the federal government has done is to set the broad
objectives which are to promote the export of encryption products, but to do so in a way that
protects both the public safety and our national security." 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Under the new government plan, a company that promises to participate in key recovery will
receive a six-month license to export up to 56-bit DES encryption. When the promise is fulfilled
and the government can get access to the decryption keys, the 56-bit limit is lifted. If by the end of
the

<p>two-year grace period the company has not fulfilled its promise to implement a key-recovery
scheme, the 56-bit limit is dropped back down to the current 40-bit limit. <em></em>

<p>Welcome to our third year anniversary issue. Glad you could stop by. As you can see, we
have a
bit of a new look to the site. Please let us know what you think by email <a
href="mailto:swcm@sprynet.com ">swcm@sprynet.com </a>. 

<p>This month we offer articles on On-line Banking and Shopping; a special section of careers
and
job searching on the net, hot reviews of PageMill, Fusion and Frontpage for all of you would-be
web page designers; we bring you the Pope and UFO's (and we're not even one of those funky
supermarket tabloids); and the start of seven new monthly columns; including one written by
nationally syndicated columnist Craig Crossman.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The biggest news I have to offer is that we will soon begin printing a new paper version of
our
magazine for distribution throughout Arizona (look out Computer Buyer, there's a real monthly
computer magazine coming to town). We will still be printing our sister publication in New York
(Tri-City Computing Magazine). We also have new affiliations with TechConnected (in Texas),
Computer Credible (in Utah), Chicago Software News and Digital Chicago (Illinois), Carolina
Computer News (North Carolina). Each of these publications is now reprinting articles from us
each month.  

<p>On a side note, If you are looking for Internet access in Arizona, check out Cyber Trails at
<a href="http://www.cybertrails.com/">http://www.cybertrails.com</a> They 
offer service to 29 cities and towns (and surrounding areas)
right now and will be offering service to Phoenix and Tucson very soon. Cyber Trails is a part of
APS - yep, your local electric company. Tell them Southwest Computer Monthly recommend
you.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Well that's it for now. Enjoy the issue. I'll see you next month.

<p>It's 3:00 A.M. and you've just remembered that your sister's birthday is tomorrow. She lives

got a computer and a modem you're only minutes away from connecting on-line to hundreds of
stores open 24 hours in cyberspace (the World Wide Web or a commercial On-line service like
America Online or CompuServe). On-line shopping is here!

<p>During the past year, Web page design tools have been popping up faster than UFO sitings. In
a
crowd that's full of many lack-luster offerings, Microsoft Corp.'s FrontPage 97 with Bonus Pack
is a standout. The program offers enhanced editing, Web site management tools, and a look and
feel reminiscent of a word processor. Moreover, it's tightly integrated into the forthcoming Office

wanting an easy and user friendly way to design a web page have been looking for, including both
client-side and server-side image map creation, no HTML coding needed, a table tool, and an
excellent frames designer for laying out frames.

evidence, according to the CD consists of no less than a downed saucer, wreckage and yes, even
aliens (dead, dying and alive) from the two saucers that crashed in New Mexico in 1947.

<p><strong>A Career Plan: Reach Your Goal Through Foresight And

<p>Knowing when it's time to change jobs is a difficult decision. It can be an extremely stressful
episode that may lead to the wrong decision. What if the new job turns out not to be the stepping
stone to advancement but a huge dead end? What if you decide to stay where you are and current
position turns goes nowhere?  Some might say that each new job gains vital experience towards
the "right one", but what this wandering from company to company really does is create
inconsistency in your achievements and actually reduces your progress towards the skills needed

<p><strong>My Virtual Career</a> </strong>By Robert Penny 

<p>For most of my earlier life my major goal was to get a job with a big company, move up the
ladder and retire after thirty years with a nice pension. After college I did get the right job and
moved along my career path in the computer industry. However, somewhere along the way, the
path was damaged by a mudslide called down-sizing. Before I knew it, the path was gone and so
was my position. At 38 I wondered what to do with the rest of my life. Then it hit me that with
the advent of the Internet and the rise of "virtual offices" my career wasn't over, it was just
beginning.

<h2><strong>Star General: win a stellar empire from your desktop</strong></h2>
<h3>By Tony Ardito</h3>

<p><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>When I reviewed Panzer General almost two years ago, I thought it was one of the finest strategy
war games I had ever played. The games manufacturer, SSI followed up the success of Panzer
General with Allied General. This too was a great game. Fantasy General came next and while I
do not like the Dungeons and Dragons genre that much, it was a solid game using an updated
Panzer General game engine. Now <a href="http://www.ssi.com/">SSI</a> has entered the next generation with a possibly the best
game yet made using the original Panzer General game engine--Star General. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The game, developed by Catware, seems to advance the Panzer General game engine to new
heights. Unlike all previous Panzer General successors, Star General takes combat into the depths
of space, giving players both interstellar combat and ground-pounding planetary combat at the
same time. Many new possibilities are opened with Interplanetary play: In addition to directing my
forces on the planet, I must now figure out how to protect my transports full of troops from being
destroyed until I can get them to the planet.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>There are a total of seven different races featured in the game. Just as with Panzer General, the
interface is polished and functional. The animated combat sequences are however, a light-year
ahead of the tiny, annoying animations that were in Panzer General. The game maps are
absolutely huge, and the massive space campaign scenarios will allow for weeks of gripping action
and playtime. As in the other "General" series, there are also lots of short scenarios that a player
can enjoy as well as the long campaign games. If you liked Panzer General, you'll love this one.  

<p>All that's missing is the bar scene from Star Wars and one of those green-skinned women from
the old Star Trek series.

<h2><strong>The VB Workshop</strong></h2>
<h3>By Ted Brockwood</h3>

<p><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Starting with this article I hope to begin a column dedicated to Microsoft's Visual Basic
programming language and various add-on tools. In this first of what I hope to be many
installments, I will discuss Visual Basic 4.0 and some add-on tools to make your forays into the
world of VB 4.0 a little easier.(Note: VB 5.0 is still in Beta, but I will hopefully start covering it
as the development schedule progresses. Also, VBScript will be covered in future articles)</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Computer programming has never been all that fun or easy. Many a company has  promised new,
fast methods of designing applications through the use of their programming languages, but few
have ever delivered. Thankfully, for those of us who need to develop applications quickly and
without a supreme knowledge of code, Microsoft developed the Visual Basic programming
system.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For those of you readers who have never dealt with Visual Basic (or VB for short) it is
Microsoft's attempt at using drag and drop tactics to develop programs with a minimum of actual
hand coding. This is done through the use of  "custom controls" or "OCX's" (formerly known as
VBX's and recently Microsoft began calling them ActiveX components). 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Creating a program in Visual Basic, while not as simple as using a word processor, is still much
easier than using conventional programming languages. Your program is developed on "forms"
which correspond to various program windows and control panels in a Microsoft Windows
application. On these forms you actual drag your custom controls to design the interface. Most of
the programming for the control is contained within the control itself, all you end up writing is the
code to glue the controls together, that is, to make everything integrate into one fluid program.
Since Visual Basic uses the BASIC programming language as its core, you don't have to know an
intricate and mind-numbing language such as C++.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>I've been using Visual Basic 4.0 for several months now and have personally found it to be fast,
friendly, and effectiveif you're developing Windows and Windows 95 applications. If you are
hoping to program for the Mac or other operating system, there are no versions available for
those platforms yet. (Though there are rumors and gossip hinting at a Mac version in the next
release, which would be a dream come true for many would-be Mac programmers).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If after reading all this you're getting jumpy to get your feet wet in the world of Visual Basic
programming, allow me to make a few suggestions.  Firstly, buy a good book on Visual Basic and
try to obtain the demo edition of VB.  Some of the more recent VB books out there actually come
with a CD containing a sample version of VB. While far from complete, this demo version (which
can also be downloaded from http://www.microsoft.com) will let you get an idea of how the
programming system works. It's much better to spend the money on a beginner's book and the
demo disk than to spend a few hundred dollars on the VB 4.0 Professional edition (or the $100 on
the VB 4.0 Standard kit) and find you just aren't the software developer type. In case you're
wondering what the differences are between the VB kits here's a brief summary.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u>The Demo kit:</u> Very simple, it is designed to give you an idea how the system works. You won't
really design too many powerful applications with it. And it's only good in at 32-bit (read:
Windows 95 or NT) environment.

<p><u>The Standard edition: </u> Much more powerful than the demo edition with many more controls. For
$99, it's a good place to start. As with the Demo, it's only operable in a true 32-bit environment.
You cannot code 16-bit applications with this edition.

<p><u>The Professional Edition: </u> The power user package. This is for those who really plan to use VB in
a professional setting. It lets you develop both 16 and 32-bit applications, and has dozens of
controls. Once you get into heavy coding, you'll find the need to move up to the Professional
Edition.

<p><u>The Enterprise Edition:</u> Business users only please. If you're developing at a corporate level, this
is the package for you, now you just have to convince accounting that you need this.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><em>Safe bets and good buys (building your toolkit)</strong></em>

<p>Now that you've purchased Visual Basic and are ready to get to work, please allow me to make a
few simple suggestions on purchases and required reading.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Firstly, read the VB manual. Yes it's boring and dry, but the time you spend reading it is time well
spent since you'll get  a good overview of the system. Also, run the on-line tutorial to generate
your own simple applications (which, through judicious recycling, you can use components of to
create larger applications).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Next, purchase copies of IDG Books "Visual Basic for Dummies" and "More Visual Basic for
Dummies".  Sure, most of us don't like being thought of as dummies, but you've got to start
learning somewhere, and the witty, intuitive teaching style used in these books really does quite a
bit to further your Visual Basic education. Plus, the sample apps (and the cartoons) are fun and
funny. So, just swallow your pride and head to your nearest bookseller for a copy of these books.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Once you've tired of the VB for Dummies series, pick up one of the power users guides. My
personal preference is "The Visual Basic 4 for Windows 95 Sourcebook" (Publisher: Osborne
McGraw-Hill, 1996, SRP: $34.95). It's huge, it's somewhat dry, but it's a great reference, and the
sample applications are very reusable in your own applications. The author, Gary Cornell, has
years of experience in VB, and has done the reader the service of filling the appendix with
commonly asked VB questions. A great buy and a resource you'll keep jumping back to.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Finally, you're going to need a first class installation program. If you plan on distributing your
finished projects, don't skimp on a good installer. Sure, you can get away with using that
shareware copy of pksfx (the self-extractor from pkware, makers of pkzip) you've got laying
around. But if you want to make your application look truly professional, you'll need something
flashy but also rock solid. It may cost you a bit to start with, but if you're going to sell those VB
applications, you don't want some poorly developed installation routine trashing your end users
systems. Which, by the way, I've seen happen with some of the shareware installers that are out
there. Some of them (I'll be kind and leave them unnamed) leave debris all over the Windows and
Windows/system directories that only someone with a good knowledge of computers could hope
to dig out and delete. So, allow me to suggest picking up a copy of InstallShield Express
Professional from InstallShield Corporation. To some the  SRP $195  price tag may be a bit
daunting, but if you want to become the next Microsoft, you won't risk ruining your reputation on
a sloppy installer. By the way, Microsoft worked closely with InstallShield, so it has quite a solid
user base to begin with (you'll note many Microsoft apps use InstallShield to install themselves,
and that's quite a testimonial!)

<p>InstallShield Express Professional, as the name implies, is quite a professional package. Some of
the major features that make it worth purchasing include:

<p>1. The ability to specify installation screen appearance (very important in this age when how
something looks sometimes wins over against how it runs)

<p>2. Specification of what files to include in the installation and the ability to direct exactly where
each and every one is installed.

<p>3. Common dialog choices. These allow you to set up user dialogs ("click to cancel" and the like)
without having to manually enter them. A great time saver.

<p>4. The ability to make changes to system files, and more importantly , the ability to reverse these
changes through a clean uninstaller.

<p>5. Registry changes are performed during install, and can be reversed if necessary. With the
Windows 95 registry being about the most important component of the system, any changes made
to it must be made carefully, and they must be readily reversible. InstallShield Express
Professional excels in this area, quickly and cleaning removing changes made to the registry and
adding new entries to the registry without killing your users systems.

<p>6. Installation testing, which is obviously very important, is done with point and click ease. So to
is the designation of icons and program folders to be created during the installation. It just doesn't
get any easier.

<p>7. Creation of distribution media (usually floppy disks for those of us unable to purchase a CD
ROM writer) is again point and click easy. InstallShield Express takes the chore of dividing up
what files go on what disk out of your hands and ensures a clean install from the media every
time.

<p>Creating an installation routine is done through an easy step by step process than anyone can
follow. 

<p>Again, allow me to say that if you want to look professional, InstallShield Express Professional is
the way to go when it comes to creating an install routine!

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>That's all for this month, stay tuned for next month when I hope to cover the new OCX's that are
coming out and give a brief overview of Visual Scipt (VB for the Internet) and the Internet
Control toolkit from Microsoft.

<title>12 x CD-ROM Drives Are Here</title>

<h2><strong>12 x CD-ROM Drives Are Here</strong></h2>
<h3>By Ed Lansing</h3>

<p><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>It seems like only yesterday that a two-speed CD-ROM drive was about all you needed to run
most software. Then came four-speed, six-speed, eight-speed ... sometimes it seems the only
things inflating faster than CD-ROM drive specs are the National Debt or the Federal Deficit. And
now, the 12-speed (12x) CD-ROM drive has just in time for the holidays.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Samsung has just introduced a 12X this month and it claims system vendors will build them into
standard computers next year. Toshiba has also introduced a 12x CD-ROM in both  ATAPI and
SCSI interfaces. In addition, NEC plans to offer products in the 12X performance range by year's
end. I'm sure that the other manufactures will follow suit within months with versions of their own
12x drives.

<p>So what does the new drive really mean for CD-ROM. Well, A 12X drive will, compared with
today's most common drives, deliver data fast (at three times the speed of a 4X CD-ROM drive).
Even though most software is still made to playback on a 2x or 4x drive, the faster drive offers
some benefits to the user. Faster drives can provide a better performance "balance." You will be
able to install files to a hard drives more quickly and perform more responsive CD searches, and 
some of the pressure off your processors will be lightened.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>And just when you thought 12x was fast, there is the digital versatile disc (DVD) drives to
consider. The technology is still being put together but these digital drives are said to make
CD-ROMs look like a battery powered go-cart racing against an Indy 500 racer in terms of speed
and performance. My latest reading on he subject says DVD technology is still being delayed
somewhat.

<title>SimulEyes VR From StereoGraphics</title>

<body text="#000000" link="#0000ff" vlink="#551a8b" alink="#ff0000" bgcolor="#c0c0c0">
<h2><strong>SimulEyes VR From StereoGraphics</strong></h2>
<h3>By Don Nelson</h3>

<p><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you've gotten bored with the constant monotony of 2D game play, find that "Descent" is
lackluster and has no depth or that 3D games just aren't really 3D, well StereoGraphics has
released a product to put a smile on your face. Called the SimulEyes VR, these 3D Shutter glasses
offer incredible depth perception and stunning realism.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3D Shutter glasses are not a new product, nor is the SimulEyes VR the only offering on the
market. StereoGraphics have been producing these type of glasses since 1980 with their flagship
product, the "Crystaleyes". With a userbase of over 20,000 in both the scientific and molecular
modeling industry, the Shutter glasses are a tried and tested technology that has proven to be very
safe to the user. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The SimulEyes VR glasses uses StereoGraphics' LCD shutter technology, the de facto standard in
sophisticated workstation environments. The liquid crystal shutters in the glasses rapidly alternate
in sync with left and right eye views on the computer monitor. The shutters ensure that the left
eye sees only the left image, while the right eye sees only the right. This system effectively
emulates normal eyesight to restore depth perception during game play.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The installation of the SimulEyes VR is incredibly simple. There are no videocards to install, dip
switches to set, interrupts to adjust, nor any software drivers. By simply plugging the glasses into
your video card through a control box, up to four pairs can be used on the same machine.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The product ships with three pieces of Software, "Descent Destination Saturn", "VR Slingshot",
and "Wolf 3D". The quality of the 3D from these glasses is absolutely amazing, and the version of
"Descent" that ships with the package shows just how exciting  SimulEyes VR can be. I was
never really into "Descent" in a single player game, but with these glasses, playing it has become a
passion during my free time.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Notice that in a well lit room, there is a slight flicker when looking at anything except the monitor.
This can be very annoying,  but reducing the lighting makes it much better. Unlike other VR
products, I have not experienced any discomfort while wearing them, and I sustained no headache
or eye strain at all after using the glasses in "Descent" for well over an hour. There is only one
thing I can say about this product, "Well Done"

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SimulEyes VR had retailed for around $179 making it one of the most affordable VR solution on
the market. However, a new agreement between StereoGraphics and PriceCostco has reduced the
price through that retailer. PriceCostco stores will begin selling 3-D gaming glasses from
StereoGraphics starting this month. PriceCostco will be pricing the SimulEyes glasses at less than
$100, and will include five games: Descent II Test Flight, Slipstream 5000, Rise of the Triad,
Whiplash Preview and In Pursuit of Greed: World 1. I was unable to find out if StereoGraphics
has reduced the price elsewhere, but I would have to assume they have. So now, SimulEyes VR 
is even a better buy!

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>StereoGraphics Corporation,

<p>2171 E. Francisco Blvd.,

<p>San Rafael, CA 94901.

<title>Online Banking Comes of Age</title>
</head>
<body text="#000000" link="#0000ff" vlink="#551a8b" alink="#ff0000" bgcolor="#c0c0c0">
<h2><strong>Online Banking Comes of Age</strong></h2>
<h3>By Patricia Bell</h3>

<p><strong><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p></strong>As of December, there are now about 70 banks in the U.S. that offer online banking, integrated
with Intuit's Quicken and/or Microsoft's Money personal-finance software, to their customers.
Roughly 30 of them, mainly large regional institutions, allow customers to use either product.
Twenty-two of  the banks offering on-line banking with Quicken also provide the service
BankNOW (more on that later), Some financial institutions, such as Citibank, prefer that
customers use proprietary software to access the bank's system. With the exception of Quicken or
Money, no software standard exists. However, IBM, has joined a consortium of 15 banks to build
a financial network with a standard protocol that will enable banks to use software branded with
their own names. This, in turn, should help spread the adoption of online banking.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>You're probably wondering why these software giants are interested in online banking. Well, if
they make a teeny-tiny, itsy-bitsy little bit of money on each transaction made, and there are
millions and millions of transactions made each day, then those itsy-bitsy amounts will add up to
very big money for the likes of IBM or Microsoft. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Microsoft is hoping to get a share of your online transactions with its extremely user-friendly
program, Microsoft Money 97. With wizards and helpful coaches, even when you stumble, it tells
you what to do. It's the right software for those who want to bank on-line and use basic planning
and budgeting tools. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Intuit's Quicken is still the market leader in personal finance software and is involved in online
banking, but it recently sold its online bill-paying service to CheckFree Corp. If you're looking for
a more advanced financial management software package (but a bit harder to use) that lets you
stay on top of all aspects of your finances and plan for the future, Quicken 6 is your choice.
However,  If your bank supports only one program, your choice is easy: use whatever they use or
go to another bank. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For those of you who didn't necessarily buy your PCs for financial management, Intuit has a new 
program called BankNOW. Intuit researched those who have stayed away from full-fledged
personal financial management software like Quicken or Money and discovered that 40 percent of
these non-buyers said they had no need to track or organize their finances. However, they were
interested in software that would allow them to pay bills quickly. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>BankNow offers online banking for those who don't want full-fledged personal finance software.
Currently, BankNow is available only through America Online; by the end of the year it will be
available via the Internet, too.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>So How Does It All Work:</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Many banks, ranging from Bank of America to Wells Fargo, now offer online services. The
services reach customers in one of three ways: proprietary software, commercial online services,
or the Internet. Software and services are relatively easy to use and consumers can preform a
number of banking tasks, ranging from balancing your checkbook and paying your bills to
managing a ton of complicated financial matters. Bill-paying is especially easy because you can set
up recurring payments for ongoing but stable monthly bills, such as mortgage or loan payments.
The service automatically makes the payments each month, and you also have the option of
changing your payment amounts before the bills get paid. Of course you have to be sure that you
have the money's in the account when it's time for the automatic payment to be made or you'll still
incur bounced check charges.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The initial setup process required for most of the online bill-paying services can be time
consuming, depending on how many bills you pay on a regular basis. But the one-time effort to
enter all of the information about your account numbers, billing addresses, and so on is well worth
the trouble. One note of caution, if you have financial relationships--loans, money-market
accounts, credit cards, checking accounts, savings accounts with several banks you probably
won't be able to make fund transfers among accounts electronically yet. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Even with a few small drawbacks, just think of all the time and effort you can save each month.
Every time you sit down to pay your bills, you write out a check, put it in an envelope, address
the envelope and then put a stamp on it. Doing this month after month takes time. With online bill
paying, after you set up an account once, all you have to do is enter in the amount. It's simple and
convenient. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>How Safe Is Online Banking?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>I've considered the possibility of some computer geek gaining access to my funds and draining my
accounts. But, fear not, the online banking services all claim state-of-the-art security. Hopefully it
isn't the same state-of-the-art security used by the CIA or the Department of Defense, who have
recently had their web sites vandalized by hackers. In addition, the banking industry says your
account is fully insured by the FDIC, generally up to $100,000 per depositor, per bank. I think
online banking is probably as safe, or safer than banking by phone or using a credit card for a
phone transaction. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Another concern about online banking is the pricing. Some banks offer these services for free,
some offer them for free so long as you maintain a minimum balance, and others charge between
$2 and $10 a month. So, shop around to get the best deal; even if it means moving your accounts
to a new bank. Even if you have to pay a fee for online banking, consider the cost of postage
when sending your bills through snail mail. Mailing only ten bills per month would cost more than
$3 in postage. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Is Online Banking the Wave of the Future?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>There are still hurdles to overcome, but online banking is starting to catch on. Industry sources
say that there are slightly more than two million U.S. households currently banking online. Sure it
sounds like a small number; until you consider that it represents close to 10 percent of all U.S.
households that own a home computer with a modem. In a recent survey by research firms Jupiter
Communications and FIND/SVP results determined that there's strong interest among PC owners
in electronic banking from home; 2.5 million U.S. households say they are very likely to begin
using online banking in the next 12 months, and 4.7 million more households say they are
somewhat likely to begin doing that in the next 12 months. That's a lot of folks making online
transactions don't you think?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Online banking isn't the only type of electronic financial transaction expected to take off in the
coming years. There are currently about 1.5 million online brokerage accounts for electronic stock
trading; about twice as many as analysts predicted two years ago. By the year 2001 it's predicted
that number will reach 10 million. Consumers are attracted to trading online because of reduced
commission costs and also a greater hand in their own investment management. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Online banking is in its infancy, but I do believe it is the wave of the future. As with everything,
consumers are slow to try it out, but just as with ATM's, once the ease of use becomes evident to
them, they will jump on the bandwagon and online banking will be as commonplace as making a
phone call.

<p> <h2>On-line Shopping: The Way of The Future or Just a
Fad</h2>
<h3>By Bill Franklin</h3>

<p><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>It's 3:00 A.M. and you've just remembered that your sister's birthday is tomorrow. She lives
across the country, so it's too late to send something through the mail. Not to worry, if you've got
a computer and a modem you're only minutes away from connecting on-line to hundreds of stores
open 24 hours in cyberspace (the World Wide Web or a commercial On-line service like America
Online or CompuServe). Once on-line, you can probably find the perfect gift, order it and have it
delivered in time for your sister's birthday celebration, all from the comfort of your home or
office. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>No matter what the occasion, going on-line can be a boon to those of us who hate going to the
mall. Merchants in cyberspace are always open and you don't have to fight for a parking space,
battle crowds or stand in line to pay. With the growing number of shopping sites on-line, the
selection can't be beat. Many on-line shoppers buy computer-related merchandise. As an example,
many  software vendors are now offering their products for sale on-line. Consumers gain
immediate access to a program, which they can download after making a secure payment,
eliminating the cost of goods, shipping and other expenses. But whether your gift list includes a
new PC, software, flowers or an unique piece of jewelry, chances are pretty high that you'll find it
on-line. In addition, since on-line sites provide virtually unlimited "shelf" space, not limited by the
physical size of a store, they can offer a wider range of products for sale. As an example,
WalMart, the nation's largest retailer, has recently launched a web site, offering thousands of
products for sale. 

<p>.

<p>PC/Meter, a company in Port Washington, NY that tracks home computer usage reports that
approximately 19.8 percent of visitors to the World Wide Web seeks out a shopping site. They
also expect that number to rise as consumers gain more confidence in shopping on-line. With
statistics showing web usage ranging from 5 - 15 million people, that 19.8 percent figure takes on
a very large meaning to retailers -- one to three million potential consumers may be seeking to buy
on-line.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>While there is still some concern about the security of on-line transactions, many consumers
believe  that buying something on-line is just as safe, if not safer, as making a purchase over the
phone. Many sites now promise secure credit card transactions, and Internet browsers such as
Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer provide special visual signals to let you
know when the information you're about to submit will be encrypted, or scrambled, to protect it
from hackers and prying eyes. All the major commercial on-line services offer secure purchasing
as well. In the unlikely event a problem does occur, most credit card issuers will remove
fraudulent charges from your bill if you report them promptly (read the fine print in your
agreement; you may have to pay the first $50). In addition, credit-card giants, Visa and
MasterCard, have begun to take a hard look at secure transactions on the Internet. Once this
happens, on-line commerce will become commonplace.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Recent studies predict that electronic transactions will run into the billions of dollars within the
next five to 10 years. Although basic electronic transaction technology is now available, most
observers think it will be several years before most users feel comfortable with the idea of using a
computer as a tool for shopping and banking. People take time to develop habits and get
comfortable with new technology. As an example, there was initial resistance to ATMs , voice
mail, answering machines and even microwave ovens; all now widely accepted as part of our
everyday lives. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you do go on-line to shop here are a few caveats to remember. Not all on-line shops are created
equal, even when they're run by the same company. JCPenney, for instance, is available on three
on-line services, America Online, Prodigy and CompuServe and on the Web at
(http://www.jcpenney.com). Each site has its own look, and sometimes even different
merchandise. The lesson? It pays to shop around. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>There are a number of virtual malls on the services and the World Wide Web. They offer a wide
range of merchants, often sharing a common interface. Some let you place all your purchases in a
single electronic shopping basket and then "check out" all your purchases (arrange for payment)
before you leave. The "malls" are great places to browse many different shops while at one web
site or on-line area.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>It's only a matter of time before on-line shopping scams turn up. I envision a site offering lots of
goods at really great prices enticing you to buy. However, once your credit card has been charged
the goods are never delivered. I think the potential for this exists more so on the World Wide
Web than the on-line services. This is primarily due to the fact that anyone can put up a web site
for a few hundred dollars, take orders and then disappear; opening a new site under a different
name the next day. The on-line services require the vendor to make a larger cash investment in
their virtual store and I feel that for now, there may be fewer improprieties with this type of
shopping. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Regardless of the potential scams out there, even when dealing with the reputable, larger retailers
be sure to ask about the company's return policies. Just as with mail order by phone, it's easy to
wind up with wrong or substandard merchandise when you don't actually see what you're buying.
But once you know what to expect, turn on your modem, take out your credit card and let the
shopping begin.

<title>Microsoft FrontPage 97:  Web Publishing MadeEasier</title>
</head>
<body text="#000000" link="#0000ff" vlink="#551a8b" alink="#ff0000" bgcolor="#c0c0c0">

<p> <h2>Microsoft FrontPage 97:  Web Publishing Made
Easier</h2>
<h3>By Bill Franklin</h3>

<p><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>During the past year, Web page design tools have been popping up faster than UFO sitings. In a
crowd that's full of many lack-luster offerings, Microsoft Corp.'s FrontPage 97 with Bonus Pack
is a standout. The program offers enhanced editing, Web site management tools, and a look and
feel reminiscent of a word processor. Moreover, it's tightly integrated into the forthcoming Office
97. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Microsoft FrontPage 97 is a vast improvement over the previous version (1.1) which was little
more than a repackaged version of the product shipped by Vermeer (Microsoft purchased
Vermeer earlier this year).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The program is a tightly integrated suite of tools. In addition to the two primary applications,
Explorer and Editor, which provide Web site management and Web editing capabilities,
FrontPage 97 includes a Bonus Pack which has Microsoft Personal Web Server, Microsoft
Thesaurus, Internet Explorer 3.0, and Microsoft Image Composer, a tool for scanning in graphical
images.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The FrontPage 97 Explorer is a Web-site management tool that provides two views of your site: a
link tree that maps out your site's files and hyperlink connections, and a folder view that mimics
Windows Explorer's look and feel by representing the directory structure of the site with
expanding and collapsing files and folders. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Like Windows Explorer,  FrontPage 97 Explorer allows full OLE drag-and-drop support. HTML
and image files can be dragged between the Explorer and other applications with OLE
capabilities. Both views allow editing only of the directory structure and not of hyperlinks. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Using the visual tools, templates and wizards included in FrontPage 97 anyone can design a
good-looking Web site with just a few clicks of the mouse. In the Tools menu and on the toolbar
are options to verify and recalculate hyperlinks. The verify function will run through all pages on
the site and check the validity of internal and external links. A summary of broken links is
displayed in a dialog with options to edit the link, to edit the page containing the link, and to add
the link to a to-do list. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Web sites are presented in hierarchical views and in site diagram form. Both views provide a
useful picture of the Web site and let the user jump to any of its pages by selecting a page from
either view with just a mouse click. Overall, the FrontPage 97 Explorer is a powerful, easy-to-use
management tool.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>FrontPage 97 maintains a word-processing-like approach to HTML editing. The FrontPage 97
Editor is used to create and maintain individual Web pages. Users familiar with Microsoft Office
will feel accustomed to the editor's operation and menu structure right away.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>There are a few limitations though. With FrontPage 97 Editor, you can't drop a table onto the
page in an arbitrary spot as you can with some other web authoring programs such as  NetObjects
Fusion.  The table can be inserted only in the linear flow of HTML tags, just as you would do in a
word processor. Like the initial implementation of tables in Microsoft Word, tables can only be
formatted and modified via dialog boxes, not directly manipulated. The page designer still has to
deal with pesky table attributes such as cell spacing, cell padding, and cell spans. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>But, beyond a few problems,  as word-processing-like HTML editors go, FrontPage 97 is the best
I've used. I found it much better than Netscape Gold 3.0, HotMeTaL Pro, and Hot Dog Pro in
terms of ease of use and integrated functions. Most important, FrontPage 97 produces clean and
well-formatted HTML.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>There's also an HTML editor available to tweak the HTML code by hand. The HTML editor
color-codes the source code to make it easier to view and differentiate between different HTML
version levels and extension types.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>One of the most useful features of the FrontPage 97 Editor is the extensive drag-and-drop
support. You can drag and drop images from a Web browser or the desktop directly into
FrontPage 97. Once there, you can convert the images back and forth from GIF to JPG, or
change the attributes of any image on the page. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For example, with a click of the mouse, you could make a GIF you dragged from another Web
page interlaced, or convert it to JPG format. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A set of wizards and templates is included to speed development of new pages and to add new
features to existing ones. There are templates for a variety of Web pages, from personal to
corporate. The Script Wizard automatically generates the VBScript code necessary to generate
events for ActiveX components. Using the wizards and templates in unison, a user can create
some very slick-looking page with-in minutes. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A Database Connection Wizard eases database access to some extent, though knowledge of SQL
still is required. There also are a number of WebBots included to help automate user interaction.
And you can easily insert Java applets and multimedia sound and video. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>About 30 pre-formed pages can be created via wizards or templates, including a survey form, a
user registration form, a table of database query results, and pages using frames. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Another toolbar provides the usual text-formatting options. But be careful here. Only Microsoft
Internet Explorer 3 supports all of the formatting options available. When FrontPage 97 was
installed, I allowed several new TrueType typefaces to be added to my system and to be made
available to the FrontPage 97 Editor. But when viewing my pages with Netscape Navigator 2, my
typeface request was ignored. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Two other toolbars cater to the intermediate user. The advanced toolbar lets you insert a Java
applet, an ActiveX control, a plug-in object (such as an Acrobat or ShockWave file), or a
PowerPoint animation. When one is inserted, FrontPage 97 presents a dialog requesting the
parameters required by the specific applet, control, or other object. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The forms toolbar lays out the various HTML form fields. Clicking on one causes a complete
form tag to be inserted at the cursor. This form won't do anything interesting, however, until you
edit the HTML code to add an action attribute that links to a Computer Graphics Interface or
server API program on the server, or add JavaScript or VBScript handlers to the form fields, or
use the built-in FrontPage 97 WebBots. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>FrontPage 97 WebBots give you seamless, interactive object programming that you can simply
drop and pop into your Web pages. Bots encompass abilities that would normally require custom
CGI programming. For example, use the Web page's Include Bot to insert the contents of a file
you designate, guaranteeing that global elements on your Web pages, such as headers and footers,
will be consistent within your site. The Save Results Bot pulls information from any form on your
site and stores it in a format of your choosing. Other Bots included in FrontPage 97 are the
Confirmation Field Bot (for processing visitor information), the Discussion Bot (for feedback),
the Registration Bot (for registering visitors) and the Search Bot.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Built-in support for Internet Database Connector (IDC) programming is also a valuable tool for
Web designers looking to make medium-duty sites as interactive as possible. Two WebBots and a
wizard help to make the setup of IDC queries and forms easier, but knowledge of Open Database
Connectivity and a working database on the other end is still required. In addition, FrontPage 97's
tools for capturing data are more limited. You cannot perform direct updates of the back-end
database. Instead, form data is saved into a text file that you must manually import. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>FrontPage 97 ships with 16- and 32-bit Personal Web Servers that support traditional Web
standards, such as HTTP and CGI. FrontPage 97 also features the Server Administrator tool for
managing security and optional server extensions to aid compatibility.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Both the client and server side can be installed on a PC for Web site testing. Once the site is
ready, the "copy Web" feature in Explorer lets the user transfer the entire site across the network
to another server containing the FrontPage 97 Server Extensions, where the site will automatically
be made public.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Microsoft Image Composer is a full-fledged image-editing tool for online graphics. It includes
more than 500 special effects and supports Adobe Systems Inc.'s Photoshop-compatible plug-ins.
Image Composer uses a Sprite model that makes it easy to adjust the layering order and
positioning of objects. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>I found FrontPage 97 easy to install and use. It is well-integrated with Microsoft Office products,
and it has a familiar look and feel. The product is fast and stable and generates Web pages that
conform with current standards. Extensive online help also is available from within FrontPage 97
Explorer, Editor and Image Composer. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In short, if you need to design or manage a Web site, FrontPage 97 will make the job easier and
require much less of your time in the process. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Beta version is available free (for a limited time) at the FrontPage 97 Web site: 
http://www.microsoft.com/frontpage/ 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The shipped version, due out this month, will cost around $149; $109 for Microsoft Office users;
and a $55 upgrade from previous versions. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To use FrontPage 97, you'll need:  Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0 or later (Macintosh version
under development), with 486 PC or better (I'd suggest using a Pentium 75 or better), 8 MB
RAM (16 Mbytes for Personal Web Server), 20 Mbytes hard disk space, and SVGA monitor.

<title>NetObjects Fusion: The Only Tool Your Website MayEver Need</title>
</head>
<body text="#000000" link="#0000ff" vlink="#551a8b" alink="#ff0000" bgcolor="#c0c0c0">

<p> <h2>NetObjects Fusion: The Only Tool Your Website May
Ever Need</h2>
<h3>By Fred Katt</h3>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>NetObjects Fusion isn't just another Web page designer. It's the best tool I've seen yet for building
Web pages and managing Web sites. It provides incredibly powerful but simple-to-learn features,
from the flowchart-like visual layout tool to the SiteStyles feature that adds pizzazz to your
pages. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Clement Mok, former Apple graphic design guru and, now, the co-founder of NetObjects, has
developed Web authoring application aimed at small and medium-sized businesses that want to
build Web sites which can be updated frequently, and that need a minimum of 15 to 20 HTML
pages. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>While aimed at the do-it-yourself market, Fusion offers an integrated package of Web-site
creation and management tools that will also meet the needs of Webmasters. Allowing designers
to lay out moderately sophisticated Web sites without having to bother with the underlying
Web-page description in HTML. A great time saver to the Webmasters - where time is always
money.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>NetObjects Fusion sets the pace for new Web authoring products with its page-layout approach
to page and site creation. Unlike the word processor-like approach, Fusion's approach lets the
Webmasters align and arrange page components with accuracy down to the pixel. Fusion
ultimately produces standards-compliant full HTML 3.2 pages, and can be viewed only by the
latest and most up-to-date browsers, such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet
Explorer. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Fusion integrates five main tools: a visual structure editor, page layout and drawing program,
style manager, site assets manager, and HTML publisher. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Fusion's SiteStructure Editor lets you build pages (and relationships) using either a hierarchical or
visual editor. You can insert pre-made, predefined sites or single page templates, then restructure
your site by dragging and dropping pages in the editor, which maintains the hierarchies. Fusion
encourages experimentation: Prototyped pages needn't appear in the final site. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Pages are laid out with the PageDraw tool. Fusion automatically generates a header (for a banner
and navigation buttons) and footer (for text hyperlinks), as well as a main body where you can
precisely place shapes, tables, audio and video files, data lists, fields and form elements. Though
you can't edit the HTML directly (the pages are generated using standard, but highly complex,
HTML tables), PageDraw has a floating palette of tools: selection, zoom, text and image objects,
tables, forms, Java applets, ActiveX controls, Macromedia Shockwave movies, drawing shapes,
and data objects. There is also support for creating image maps. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Fusion's SiteStyle Manager offers various looks for banners, buttons, backgrounds, data list icons
and link text colors. Unlike the dry-looking objects you generally find in clip-art libraries, these
styles are jazzy attention-grabbers. Styles offer consistency, but they're used in a unique way.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Included with Fusion are almost 50 predefined SiteStyles. All are professionally designed and are
ideal for intranet sites and Internet sites that don't require a unique look. A classy-looking site can
be whipped up in a matter of hours.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The SiteAssets view lets you centrally manage your Web site resources. Change a bitmap here,
and the program perpetuates the change throughout your site. 

<p>SitePublish Manager: Fusion keeps all HTML behind the scenes, so the user must publish the site
before moving it to a staging or production server. Fusion creates HTML files for each page in
the site and moves them to a specified Web server directory. A built-in File Transfer Protocol
capability transfers files to remote servers. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A few SitePublish settings specialize the files for different kinds of Web servers. One setting
publishes a text-only version of the site, doing this by merely skipping the images and displaying
only the text. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>When Fusion generates your site, it merges the selected style and the appropriate text to generate
all the bitmaps needed on every page. For example, if your page is called Marketing Department,
Fusion creates a custom banner in your selected style with the words Marketing Department
centered within the bitmap. Buttons that direct you to other pages are a combination of smaller
buttons in the same style and each page's name. Change the name, and Fusion generates new
buttons. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>You can also generate text-only versions of your site or "low-bandwidth" editions that reduce
GIFs to four colors and JPEG images by 50 percent. Site generation is very fast, given everything
that Fusion does. I generated a mythical 25-page WINDOWS Magazine Subscriber Site in less
than three minutes. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Fusion's data objects are linked to a database that is either internal to Fusion or accessible through
an Open Database Connectivity driver. The data-list object creates a sorted, filtered list of
database records according to your criteria. The list is formatted in the HTML bullet style with
either standard HTML bullets or a bullet image you specify. Each record in the data list can be
automatically linked to an individual page that Fusion generates. These pages, which NetObjects
calls stacked pages, display information from each record and follow a master format. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>One slight drawback is that the data-objects functions in Fusion are read-only-you can't update or
change database records from a Web page. Also, the data is accessed only when the site is
published in Fusion, so pages aren't dynamic. The data can be updated by republishing the site,
however. Many sites-especially corporate intranet sites-rely on products like Cold Fusion from
Allaire Corp. in Cambridge, Mass., or Microsoft's Internet Database Connector to populate Web
pages with up-to-the-minute data. If your site requires live database queries embedded in pages,
then NetObjects Fusion probably is not for you. But if your site requires updates on a nightly or
weekly basis (instead of hourly or by the minute), Fusion will do just fine. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Fusion is unlike any other Web tool you've seen. It's easy-to-build knockout pages can be up and
running in a matter of hours.  NetObjects Fusion runs without proprietary extensions and is
compatible with all standard browsers and servers. A version of Fusion is immediately  available
for download, at <a href="http://www.netobjects.com/">http://www.netobjects.com/</a>. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><pre>System Requirements:
Windows 95 or Windows NT (Mac support is coming)
16 MB of RAM
A Pentium 90 or better
A minimum of 10 MB hard-drive space (50 is the average install)
SVGA Graphics
Price: $695 
888-449-6400, 415-482-3200

<p>While visiting the NetObjects web site I became aware of this new announcement and have
included it here. NetObjects has now introduced NetObjects Fusion 2.0. With over 100 new
features and improvements and 25 new SiteStyles. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Key New Features include:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SiteImport The new SiteImport feature now lets you import an existing site and enhance it using
all the visual power of NetObjects Fusion 2.0. This lets you leverage the investment in your Web
site, and reduce the effort and cost of updating your site over time. You can import a local site or
grab a site off the Web, including all of its assets. The SiteImport feature also lets you import an
entire site or selected portions of a site. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>MasterBorders: NetObjects Fusion 2.0 brings you another first, MasterBorders: a revolutionary
new concept for Web sites and Web pages. MasterBorders provide borders around your page
layout for you to place elements that automatically appear on all pages of your Web site, such as
navigational controls, company logo or calls-to-action. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>AutoFrames are a new breakthrough that provide the easiest way to create a frames-based Web
site. Unlike other products that require you to manually set up frames on a page-by-page basis,
AutoFrames let you convert, at the click of a button, any MasterBorder into a frame.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>NetObjects Fusion 2.0 ships with a number of components including: 

<p>1. NetObjects BBS: a fully functional threaded message board

<p>2. FormHandler: a CGI Script that allows your Web site visitors to send feedback via your Web

<p>forms 

<p>3. SiteMapper: an advanced Java-based application for viewing and navigating your site 

<p>4. DynaButtons: Java-based buttons that have a dynamic state (mouse over, pressed, depressed)
and can be used when you set your site style 

<p>5. Rotating Billboard: a Java-based applet that displays different pictures of your choice.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A pre release trial version of NetObjects Fusion 2.0 for Windows will be available for download
by the end of December 1996. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The shipping version of NetObjects Fusion 2.0 is expected to be available early in the first quarter
of 1997 at a street price of around $495.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At that time, registered users of NetObjects Fusion 1.0 for Windows will be able to download a
free upgrade to NetObjects Fusion 2.0 for Windows from the NetObjects Web site. This
download will include the full 2.0 product as well as complete online documentation in Adobes 

<p>PDF format.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>With this new version, Fusion just keeps getting better and better.

<p> <h2><strong>Adobe Pagemill: Web Publishing Power Arrives For
The Rest Of Us</strong></h2>
<h3>By Trish Roberts</h3>

<p><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In September of this year, Adobe Systems released a beta version of Pagemill 2.0 for Windows
95. This web page authoring program was packed with some important features that those
wanting an easy and user friendly way to design a web page have been looking for, including both
client-side and server-side image map creation, no HTML coding needed, a table tool, and an
excellent frames designer for laying out frames. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the past, you practically had to be a programmer to create pages for the World Wide Web. But
PageMill makes building Web pages a simple task. You don't have to know a thing about HTML
(Hypertext Markup Language), tags, URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), or any of the other
Internet protocols that have made composing Web pages look difficult. PageMill allows you to
create colorful, dynamic pages as easy as using your favorite graphics application or word
processor!

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) preview mode allows you to install many, but not
all, Netscape plug-ins, and they'll work. You also can see animated graphics-interchange formats
(GIFs). I also really like Pagemill's new Download Statistics tool, which gives you an idea of how
long it will take to download your page over a selected Internet connection. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>How easy is PageMill to use you ask? Well if Karl Marx were alive today, he probably would
have written his Communist Manifesto with PageMill (no, I am not a communist - he was just the
first guy to come to mind while writing this. If you have problems with communists, please
substitute Abraham Lincoln and the Gettysburg Address here). Either way, the project would
have been a real breeze. PageMill provides a comprehensive set of tools for developing Web
pages that makes it easy for anyone,  whether a seasoned veteran of HTML or a novice still
wondering what the web is, to develop attractive, effective Web pages. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The earlier version of PageMill had a few problems, mainly its inability to view and edit raw
HTML code. Adobe has fixed this problems with Version 2.0.  The Placeholder feature lets
Webmasters place arbitrary code, such as JavaScript, Common Gateway Interface scripts, or
Visual Basic script, into HTML pages, giving Webmasters a more customizable design
environment. Other features include support for HTML tables and frames and an adequate, but
slow, spell checker. The new features, particularly the capability to add to and edit HTML source
code, makes PageMill more useful to serious Web page designers.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>With PageMill 2.0, users can flip back and forth between HTML source code and the page layout
view. This can be especially useful for adding functions that a Common Gateway Interface script
might need (these are items on a web page such as visitor counters, and forms that users can
fill-out). Additionally, in the code view, all the HTML tags are color coded, making editing easier.

<p>With PageMill, web design is very, very easy. You type in your text or import it from a word
processor program. Then, bring in images from your favorite graphics programs-or from any
source, for that matter. PageMill automatically converts PICT files to GIF and JPEG, the image
formats of the Web. Even Java applets and Netscape plug-ins are supported; they're treated the
same as any other object. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Next, resize your images easily, choosing text color, and align your text any way you want,
including flowing it around the images. Making a sentence italic? Bold? Larger or smaller? Is just
a simple Click away. You can also add horizontal rules (lines), background images, colors, and
more, just as easily. You can even cut and paste a table directly from your spreadsheet! To create
a link to another page, you simply select the text or image you want to link, and then drag the
icon for the destination page back onto the selection. They link instantly!

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>PageMill has support for practically anything a would-be Web guru could desire. Adding tables is
a snap, with a pull-down menu similar to the table generator in Microsoft Corp.'s Word for
Windows. Frames are slightly trickier to implement but still relatively easy.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>I visited the Adobe web site while putting the finishing touches on this article and noticed that the
beta version was no longer available for download. A press release stated that the Macintosh
version of 2.0 was shipping now and that the Windows 95 and NT version would be shipping
shortly.  So we will all just have to wait a while longer for it. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Whether you're a Web amateur creating a personal page on the company intranet or a Web
consultant creating pages for paying clients, PageMill 2.0 should be well worth the $149
investment when it ships to the public sometime in December/Janauary.

<title>MASQUE: Electronic Business Forms For Intranets</title>
</head>
<body text="#000000" link="#0000ff" vlink="#551a8b" alink="#ff0000" bgcolor="#c0c0c0">
<h2><strong>MASQUE: Electronic Business Forms For Intranets</strong></h2>
<h3>By Anthony Accetta</h3>

<p><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Corporations are increasingly embracing web software to build internal networks. These
networks, called intranets, provide the medium for the electronic equivalent to meetings, briefings,
announcements and employee information networks. Intranets allow organizations to conduct
business over the network, speeding up delivery times, cutting costs and keeping employees more
up-to-date than has previously been possible. Masque 2.4, from Unisoft Wares Inc. (UWI)
business forms software provides a very nice electronic forms solution for use over intranets and
the Internet. The primary intranet requirement is an open, integrated system, to give users access
to widely different information from a single desktop interface. By basing Masque software on
open protocols and integrating it with web browsers, UWI has provided what may become an
intranet standard for electronic forms software. Some of the current features of the Masque client
software are edit checking, formatting and attachments. Future plans for Masque software
products include moving to a browser plug-in architecture for the client software, and adding
digital signatures.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Masque 2.4 is a forms viewer that runs as a helper from most Web browsers. The dialect used to
create Masque forms, UWI's Universal Forms Description Language (UFDL), overcomes the
layout limitations of HTML and lets you closely match the layout of paper forms. Electronic
forms are viewed and completed from a Web browser using a special helper application.
Completed forms (with accompanying data and attachments) can be submitted using almost any
SMTP mail system. Alternately, data can be transmitted through the browser, allowing
information to be processed by separate Common Gateway Interface (CGI) applications.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Electronic forms have the sophistication needed to replace bulky, expensive paper files. And while
using other electronic forms on the web has meant limited flexibility in functionality and design,
UFDL forms are both elegant and easy to use.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A key advantage of electronic forms over paper forms is the ability to easily correct data entry
errors without having to start a new form. When the ease of correcting data entry errors is
combined with intelligent features which prevent errors, it's easy to see why electronic forms are
quickly replacing paper forms. Users can attach electronic documents to any form with the click
of a button. Attachments are inserted into or extracted from a form's built-in filing system. A form
may contain many different file folders, and attachments may be assigned to one or many of the
folders. Attachments are a convenient way to group related documents to a form for storage or
transmission. For example, a lawyer filing a petition to probate a will can attach supporting legal
files and submit them to court, along with the petition form. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The first component of UWI business forms solution is for the user's desktop - the UWI Masque
Forms Viewer. The forms viewer allows users to display and use UFDL forms on their local
desktop. As a helper application to web browsers, the viewer uses the web browser's network
capabilities to transmit URL requests to http servers. The viewer may also be used in a standalone
mode to display and submit UFDL forms.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>UWI offers a range of sample forms that can be modified with a text editor; I made simple
changes to one in 15 minutes. UFDL's C language syntax is not for end-users. For now, UWI says
it will reproduce some of your paper forms in UFDL for little or no cost. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The form-design application should resolve this problem, but it waits in the wings while UFDL
undergoes refinements. For example, calculation functions are still being added -- an important
ingredient of any automated form. The revised specifications will also permit the embedding of
Java code. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Those concerns aside, Masque has the makings of a decent forms viewer. I had no problem
configuring it as a helper application from all the major Web browsers (a plug-in version is under
development). The sample forms appear much better than most I've seen designed with HTML
forms tags. For instance, fields appear precisely aligned, and drop-down lists are easy to use. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Besides aesthetics, Masque provides data error-checking, formatting, spell-checking, and a
search-and-replace tool. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In addition, forms may contain attachments, such as word processing or spreadsheet files. The
form definition, data entered, and attachments are all put into a single text file (using a special
ASCII conversion technique) that can be saved and delivered using any e-mail system. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The process of enclosing attachments and extracting them is very simple, using buttons and dialog
boxes designed into the form. Mailing a form can occur either through a Web browser or by
invoking your mail application, but these options must be hard-coded in the form. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Two other components of UWI business forms solution are server-based. The UWI Masque
Postscript Print Server (CGI script) converts UFDL forms to postscript for printing. The UWI
Masque Database Gateway is a CGI script based on Open DataBase Connectivity (ODBC). The
Database Gateway reads SQL statements from UFDL forms and queries the database for
information to populate a form with, or transfers user-entered data from the forms to the
database.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The final components of UWI solution are C, APIs and a Visual Forms Designer. The UWI
Masque APIs include functions to parse and modify UFDL forms. As well, the APIs provide
developers with the tools to create additional server- and client-side components. The UWI
Masque Visual Forms Designer provides developers with a visual tool to design UFDL forms,
including the ability to easily incorporate images and create custom form objects. The designer
also comes with a built-in form syntax debugger.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A developer's toolkit with APIs for integrating forms with other applications is included. UWI
includes a PostScript Print Server that's implemented as a CGI script. UWI indicated that other
companies are working on CGI database gateways to let Masque forms interact with
ODBC-compliant databases. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>UFDL looks as if it could become the de facto electronic-forms standard for intranets. That's
reason enough, I think, to examine how you might apply Masque as you build more around your
intranets. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Pros: Easy-to-mail UFDL-based forms; possible to create forms that work with Common
Gateway Interface print servers or database gateways, or that interact with standard HTML
documents; files can be attached to forms; advanced functions, such as spell-checking, included in
viewer. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Cons: Form-design application still under development; the 16-bit application; typically requires
third-party applications for integration with databases or other programs.

<title>MARKETING REAL ESTATE ON THE WEB</title>

<body text="#000000" link="#0000ff" vlink="#551a8b" alink="#ff0000" bgcolor="#c0c0c0">
<h2><strong>MARKETING REAL ESTATE ON THE WEB</strong></h2>
<h3>By   Virg Leary - RE/MAX property professionals, Albany NY</h3>

<p><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Well, here I am, turning into a computer geek Grandma -- and a Real Estate agent to boot (no
pun intended) ....Anyway to keep a long story short , I have had my Web site up and running
since Sept. of 1994 .  I believe I was surely one of the first, if not THE first Realtor from the
Albany area to have a presence on the Internet.  It's been pretty successful.  It has taught me a lot
about (1) Marketing, (2) Computers, (3) Potential buyers &amp; sellers from around the country.  I
have had thousands of "hits," many, many inquiries from Buyers around the country, who will (or
already have) locate in the Capital District.

<p>And I have found out that I have NOT sold any of my listings as a direct result of my HomePage.
I have definitely made some sales that I can be 100% sure were a direct result of my Web Site.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you can shop for flowers, candy, gifts, jewelry, or research automobile prices, you can
unquestionably find a home in any area of the country.  If you don't want to call ME to help you
find a home in Arizona or California, you CAN do it yourself via the Internet.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>I also found out that the potential buyers who are searching for homes via their computers are
well educated, mostly upper- end buyers or those searching for something unique. They are
exploring in a geographical area where they may be unfamiliar.  This is typically an employment
relocation .

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>They usually E mail me directly, chat about their plans to relocate to our area, &amp; then ask for
some help.  I take it from there.  After asking a few questions regarding  time frame for their
move, price range, housing style and  amenities, I follow up by snail-mailing them a relocation
package.  Most contacts  I continue to communicate with by E Mail.  After all if you are working
with someone from another area, it surely pays to communicate electronically.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>I also find that it's so much easier to send "other" info via E mail by sharing some other local or
area URL addresses with potential clients.  Most all of them want some information regarding
school systems in New York  State.  Instead of photocopying reams of statistics from schools in
the area, I just introduce them to the &lt;www.nysed.gov&gt; and let them find their own statistics for
the various school districts that interest them.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Is this a form of marketing I would recommend to other Realtors.  Yes, but only and I stress
"only" if they make an effort to keep their pages fresh looking, change their listings and check in
with their E mail at least 3 times a day and answer messages immediately.  If you wait a few days
before acknowledging the E Mail, the Customer's interest has gone somewhere else, another site,
another Realtor.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Does selling Real Estate on the Web work for me??? You bet it does. I also work with local folks
who are buying or selling.  Check my site at http://www.albany.net/~remaxvrg/

<title>Chronicle Of The 20th Century: A Multimedia EyeFeast</title>

<body text="#000000" link="#0000ff" vlink="#551a8b" alink="#ff0000" bgcolor="#c0c0c0">

<p> <h2><strong>Chronicle Of The 20<sup>th</sup> Century: A Multimedia Eye
Feast</strong></h2>

<p><strong>By Carol Lyons</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This new CD-ROM from DK Multimedia makes an ambitious claim that it is, "the ultimate guide
to every day of the century - every day of your life."  And with information on over  34,000 days
-- one for every day of the century (up to July 1996 when the program was released) they make
good on their claim.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>All the events of what may be humankind's most tumultuous, tragic, and triumphant century are a
mere mouse-click away in this amazing new CD-ROM. From the Wright Brothers' first flight to
the Apollo moon landing . . . from the fall of the czar to the fall of the Berlin Wall . . . from votes
for women to the struggle against apartheid . . . Chronicle of the 20th Century CD-ROM brings
the entire scope of these world shaking events right to your computer screen. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Chronicle of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century CD-ROM is based on the very successful book (over  5 million
copies sold) of the same name. The Chronicle of the 20th Century CD-ROM adds the power of
multimedia to this critically acclaimed best-seller. A wonderfully rendered 3D Newsroom is the
starting place to more than 6,000 news stories; laid out in a newspaper fashion, giving the user a
"you are there" style that makes history as current as today's headlines. The 3d Newsroom allows
the user to have an interactive route to view the materials on the CD-ROM. The user can open
file cabinets, watch a TV that presents extremely clear vintage video/film footage, browse through
books and look at photos all with the easy click of the mouse. If the Newsroom is not your style,
you can opt for a regular menu that gives you all of the same options but is laid out in a more
Windows type environment.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Each of the 1,100 News Screens takes you through the century month by month, and each screen
is linked to even more information in the form of News in Brief, which shows you what happened
day by day throughout the century; News Extra, packed with up-to-the-minute news; and the
News Review panel, a scrolling timeline of each year's biggest stories. You'll find an entry for
every single day of the century (up to July 1996). O.K., now you're thinking, so what if this is
such a great program, it doesn't actually cover the entire 20<sup>th</sup> Century and I'll feel like something is
missing. Not to worry over this, to some extent you are right, the CD-ROM is four years and 5
months shy of the entire 20<sup>th</sup> Century. However, DK Multimedia has set up a web site entitled
Chronicle Online, which will allow the user to keep up-do-date with the latest events by visiting
the site. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Granted if you do not have a modem or an Internet connection/online service you can not access
this current information. My suggestion to you is to get access as quickly as possible. You're
missing not only the Chronicle Online web site, but also all of the other very useful information
that can be found on the world wide web. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Chronicle Online is a built-in link to a constantly changing online magazine where you can enter
contests and win free CD-ROMs, stroll through a Time Gallery and see what life was like in every
decade, and send in your own photographs and recollections to help create the People's Chronicle
-- a worldwide database of remembrances that will be referred to and treasured for years to come. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>I visited Chronicle Online and was able to read about events as current as a few days ago; step
back to the 1950's through the Time Gallery and view some cool cars with outrageously big fins,
and also spend some time checking out the fashions and cultural norms of that first post-war
decade.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Connecting to Chronicle Online is quite easy. There is a clickable link on the CD-ROM's menu bar
that allows access by calling up your system's web browser and dialing out to your Internet
connection. I have a number of web browsers on my system and as I ran the program it searched
for and found each of them, asking me which one I would like to connect with. I opted for
Microsoft Internet Explorer. Once at the site, which is for owners of the CD-ROM only, you
enter a password to gain entry. The site is free for now, and my sources at DK Multimedia say the
company has no immediate plans to charge for access. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The CD-ROM is an unparallel reference source. Chronicle of the 20th Century CD-ROM features
biographies of 100 of the century's movers and shakers, ranging from such diverse personalities as
Ghandi, Madona, Stalin and Martin Luther King. There is also a section with eight detailed "20th
Century in Focus" articles to give you the "big picture" about major events in our time. It includes
World War One, The Russian Revolution, Europe Of The Dictators, America Between The War,
World War Two, Space Exploration, The Vietnam War, and The Fall Of Communism. Each
section features animation, audio and video clips, and links to short background and full articles
on the events surrounding the topic. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>I examined the section entitled, "Europe of the Dictators" and leaned how Mussolini, Franco and
Hitler came to power, and also a great deal of information on the events taking place in Europe
and the rest of the world during the period between World Wars One and Two.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The CD-ROM includes an easy yet powerful search function. With over 2 million words, 6,000
news article, 3,000 photographs, 90 archival sound clips, 70 videos, 80 maps and animations - all
combined with a powerful, precise search tool that speeds you to the information you're looking
for - this disk is ideal for research, reference, or just for some very interesting true-life
entertainment. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The CD-ROM also includes a 50-hour free trial of America Online, plus a coupon for a free copy
of Chronicle '97, the yearbook that details all of 1996's major developments in politics, art,
science, media, sports, and more -- a $12.95 value!

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This is a very well-done and informative multimedia CD-ROM experience that offers a an
in-depth glimpse into the events that have shaped our century. It's a great program for the history
buff, the student, writers, or just about anyone interested in knowing more about 20<sup>th</sup> Century
history. And, just for fun, you can always just checkout what the headline was on the day you
were born.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Minimum system requirements:

<p>Windows: 486DX/33MHz or faster with 8 MB RAM (12 MB recommended for Windows 95), 30
MB hard disk space, double-speed CD-ROM drive, 8-bit sound, 8-bit (256-color) 640 x 480 pixel
display (16-bit colors preferred), loudspeakers or headphones, mouse, Windows 3.1 or later.
Estimated street price: $39.95.  To access Chronicle Online, you will need a modem.  A
Macintosh version is to be announced soon. Estimated street price: $39.95.

<p> <h2><strong>Better Homes and Gardens Holiday Celebrations:
Crafts, cooking, decorating</strong></h2>
<h3>By Barbara Aimes</h3>

<p><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Have you ever opened a beautifully wrapped gift only to find that it contained Aunt Edna's terrible
fruit cake inside? Holiday Celebrations is a lot like that: It's well decorated and topped with
festive holiday tunes, but the contents are surprisingly not what you'd expect.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The program begins with a short video of Jean LemMon, editor-in-chief of Better Homes and
Gardens magazine, who appears again later in the program to introduce the three sections: 
Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day. Most of the activities center on Christmas, and
feature clever gift-wrapping ideas and instructions on how to create handmade ornaments and
inexpensive centerpieces. The program offers six projects for Thanksgiving, and three for New
Year's Day.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Holiday Celebrations presents 38 activities; not a lot when you consider that a single issue of a $3
holiday-crafts magazine might contain twice that many. Most are demonstrated on video, but the
majority are so uncomplicated that the visual cues are unnecessary. Still, if you're looking for
things to do with your kids, simple is better; with such things as creating personalized gift bags or
cutting ornaments from foam trays and decorating them with paint pens.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The program also includes an on-screen recipe box with 82 dishes-ranging from an apple-walnut
tart to Yule truffles - that can be sorted alphabetically by course or by holiday. The large photos
are appetizing, and each well-written recipe includes complete nutritional information. But with
none of the features common to the best cooking software (such as the ability to adjust the
number of servings automatically), the recipes offer little more than you'd find in a well -written
printed cookbook.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The good news, however, is that a hardcover book, Cookies, Cookies, Cookies, is included in
Holiday Celebration's low price. Getting two gifts for the price of one is always a welcome
surprise.

<p>$24.95 (Windows 3.1 CD-ROM, Macintosh CD-ROM), including hardcover book, from
Multicom Publishing, (800) 850-7272, (206) 622-5530, http://www.multicom.com.

<p>Happy Holidays!

<title>The Pope on CD: A Potpourri of Papal Facts, Photosand Multimedia </title>

<p> <h2><strong>The Pope on CD: A Potpourri of Papal Facts, Photos
and Multimedia </strong></h2>
<h3>By Martin P. Waterman</h3>

<p><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>It was probably only a matter of time until the "The Pope" was to be available on electronic
media.  This CD has its origins with the Italian software publisher Sacis, one of Europe's largest
publishing houses.  It has been translated for North American market by Lifestyle Software Group
of St. Augustine, Florida who have the North American rights.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>When I first got the CD, I had the preconceived notion that it would be about a religious figure
and therefore it would come across as being preachy complete with a "Holier than Thou" attitude. 
This was not the case owing to the fact that this CD is not produced by the Vatican but through
private and therefore capitalistic minded individuals.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Pope CD gives us the biography of Pope John Paul II which, much to my surprise, was
actually quite entertaining at times. The packaging gives no real hints of the type of  information
inside which is unfortunate.  I wondered if the marketers of this CD are simply counting on some
of the more than 60 million Catholics in the United States to simply purchase the product because
of its topic.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The front cover of the CD has a picture of John Paul II and the inscription "The Pope" and on the
back "The Man", "The Thought" &amp; "The Pontificate" which does not tell much about the contents
except for the fact that these also represent the three sections of the CD-ROM.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>"The Man" section takes a peek at the private life of the Pope which includes favorite sports,
music, foreign languages, his love for Poland (his homeland) as well as devotion.  I enjoyed
learning that the Pope was once an aspiring actor as well as being a playwright.  Information such
as this gave some depth to the person behind the Pope.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>"The Thought" takes you into the section regarding his views on such themes as family,
Communism, Capitalism, women and other themes such as social doctrine.  This section takes you
into the Pope's mind and discusses a wide range of his beliefs, values and opinions on a variety of
issues.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>"The Pontificate" contains the meat portion of this CD.  Included is a year-by-year breakdown of
his seventeen years as Pope.  Simply choose a year, then an event and you will presented with the
data through sound, text, video and photographs.  The CD is not spartan when it comes to

<p>information.  I had expected information on his election, his countless voyages and meetings with
world leaders.  I was surprised it came complete with video of the assassination attempt as well as
his meeting with his would be assassin. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Too many CDs on the market promise the encyclopedic type content that this type of medium is
able to deliver.  While the information is finite, this CD does pack a great deal of information. It is
a veritable potpourri of papal facts, photos and multimedia clips.   

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Not being a member of the Catholic faith I must confess that I found this a very enjoyable CD
particulary since it reminded me of popular events that had occurred in the nearly two decades Of
Pope John Paul II.  Seeing the Pope with Reagan, Gorbachev and other leaders put a number of
historical events in different context namely a chance to view these events from the perspective of
the leader of the Catholic church.  The CD provided an easy and interactive manner to get to
know the Pope better through his thoughts, travels and actions and would be good reference
material if you have any children in school or are curious about things Papal.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Pope system requirements are quite meager by today's standard; an IBM compatible machine, 
a 486 DX33 or higher with 4 MB of RAM and Windows 3.1 or higher and at least a double speed
CD-ROM.  The Pope comes with a suggested retail price of $ 49.95 and should be widely
available.  If not, it can be ordered from Lifestyle Software Group at 1-800-289-1157 or through
their WWW site at http://www.lifeware.com

<title>Voyager Releases Treasures of the American Museumof Natural History</title>

<p> <h2><strong>Voyager Releases Treasures of the American Museum
of Natural History</strong></h2>
<h3>By Steven Steinberg</h3>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Ever since I was a kid I loved visiting the American Museum of Natural History in New York
City. The vastness of the halls filled with treasures from a thousand different cultures and historic
periods were awesome to a 12 year old - and to be honest, the place still wows me today.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>When I heard that Voyager had announced the release of Treasures  of the American Museum of
Natural History, a new CD-ROM for ages 10 and up, I said great, have to check out and review
this one. The program presents fifty treasures from the Museum's vast collections and laid out
around eight guided tours that link the treasures thematically and introduce all sorts of
behind-the-scenes material: rare photographs, unusual film footage, and lots of surprises. The
CD-ROM is  available for Macintosh and Windows with a suggested price of $39.95.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Since it was founded in 1869, the American Museum of Natural History has sponsored over one
thousand scientific expeditions to nearly every corner of the world. Museum explorers have
unearthed dinosaur eggs in the Gobi Desert, brought back a colossal meteorite from the icy
reaches of Greenland, and captured a real dragon in the Malay Archipelago. In this spirit of
exploration users can move around the Visible Woman, the world's first computer-simulated
hologram; scroll across the hundred-foot-long Evolutionary Trees of Fishes, from sharks to
sunfish; watch a morph of human evolution from Australopithecus to spear-toting Cro-Magnon
man; and navigate around the Akeley Hall of African Mammals using QuickTime&uuml; VR.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><pre><strong>Other Program Features</strong>

* A map showing the origin of each treasure
* The floor plan of the Museum with links to corresponding exhibits
* A notebook for taking notes and composing a travelogue
* An easy-to-use glossary, hyperlinked to text throughout the CD-ROM
* The Dinosaur Dig Game that lets you uncover the bones and assemble
T. Rex
* A Supplementary Guide for teachers and parents

<strong>System Requirements</strong>

*  Windows: 486DX-66 MHz or faster processor; 8 MB RAM; 640,
256-color display; double-speed CD-ROM drive; 16-bit sound card with
external speakers or headphones; Windows 3.11 or Windows 95; DOS 6.0
or later

*  Macintosh: Any color-capable Macintosh, 33 MHz 68040 or faster
processor; at least 8 Mbytes of installed RAM (5,500K free); 640&Ntilde;480,
256-color display; double-speed CD-ROM drive; external speakers or
headphones recommended; System 7 or higher.

<title>Out of this World - UFOs of CD: Flying Disks come toComputer Disks</title>
</head>
<body text="#000000" link="#0000ff" vlink="#551a8b" alink="#ff0000" bgcolor="#c0c0c0">

<p> <h2>Out of this World - UFOs of CD: Flying Disks come to
Computer Disks</h2>
<h3>By Martin P. Waterman</h3>

<p><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Does this CD really provide the "Real Story" on UFOs?  That depends.  By the evidence
suggested on the CD-ROM, the ones who have the real story is the U.S. Government.  This
evidence, according to the CD consists of no less than a downed saucer, wreckage and yes, even
aliens (dead, dying and alive) from the two saucers that crashed in New Mexico in 1947. 
Therefore, the story of this CD is the ideas put forward that builds a strong case despite the fact
that so much information is controlled and suppressed. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The CD clears up a number of misconceptions starting out with dispelling the argument that flying
saucers have never been seen on radar, over cities, by multiple and by credible witnesses.  The CD
furthers its point by citing polls that show that more people believe in flying saucers than do not. 
Of equal or greater interest, the likelihood to believe in flying saucers raises with ones level of
education. 

<p>The first thing to realize about the CD-ROM is that it comes from Stanton Friedman who has
been accepted as of the top, if not the top UFO researcher in the world.  Friedman in unique
among researchers as he has a strong scientific and research background and is himself is a
nuclear physicist.

<p>He has given over 700 lectures and has appeared on such shows as Nightline, Unsolved
Mysteries, Larry King and an impressive list of others.  He was also the lead researcher into the
New Mexico incident and is responsible for having so many credible witnesses speak and
intimidation and long silences.

<p>So prominent is Friedman in the field of UFO research that it is hard to do any reading or research
without his name popping up.  Friedman's strength which is reflected in the CD is that not only
does he put forward popular UFO theories, he also substantiates his claims using available
evidence, logic, scientific theories and witnesses that have nothing to gain by telling their
experiences.  

<p>The entire tour of the CD took me several hours so, we are not dealing with encyclopedia type of
information.  However, the information provided is to the point and there is not much filler.  I
particularly enjoyed the clips of UFO's and the many illustrations and photographs.  Believers and
nonbelievers alike should enjoy this CD since it does present the viewer with information that is
rarely available so that they may make up their own mind or simply be aware of the great debate
that is ongoing regarding the UFO phenomena.  

<p>Before I popped the CD-ROM in the computer, I had the advantage of having to review 3 videos
on the topic for a video publication so, I had a base for some comparison.  The CD does cover all
the bases from abductions, evidence and you can even conduct your own interview with Freidman
covering several dozen topics.  The CD does have some eery music in some of the sections which
became annoying after a while and the software maker much have been aware of this possibility
since you can turn it off. 

<p>The CD-ROM requires a 386 or higher IBM PC and a double speed CD-ROM.  It requires a
VGA monitor with 640 x 480 resolution.  Taking into consideration that this CD-ROM does not
come from big software house and is a little choppy in places, it does deliver much thought
provoking material.    .   

<p>The CD Rom is available for US 29.95 + $3 S&amp;H. from Unity Publishing, 106 Main St, Suite
669, Houlton, ME 04730. If they want to order by VISA or Master Card, they can call
1-800-704-3777.

<title>CorelDRAW 7 For Windows 95: Time To UpgradeAgain</title>
</head>
<body text="#000000" link="#0000ff" vlink="#551a8b" alink="#ff0000" bgcolor="#c0c0c0">

<p> <h2><strong>CorelDRAW 7 For Windows 95: Time To Upgrade
Again</strong></h2>
<h3>By A. Accetta</h3>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As a veteran user of CorelDRAW 5, I found it to be a very useful and powerful package of
applications and utility features that worked well for most, if not all of my graphic needs. Then
along came CorelDRAW 6, billed as the mother of all 32-bit graphics packages. And indeed it is a
very nice program. A bit unstable at times (just as CorelDRAW 5 was), but for all practical
purposes a solid graphics package usable by novices and professionals alike.  But, hold on to your
seats, those folks at Corel have just announced the release of CorelDRAW 7. Heralded as all the
things CorelDRAW 6 was and more. Wanting to find out for myself I obtained a copy and put it
through a few paces for this review.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>CorelDRAW 7, which is designed for Windows 95 and Windows NT, comprises three core
applications: CorelDRAW, Corel Photo-Paint, for photo editing and bitmap creation, and
CorelDream 3D, for 3D modeling and rendering. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In addition to the three main applications, CorelDRAW 7's utilities include Corel Multimedia
Manager 7, for organizing and managing graphics files; Corel Texture, for creating simulated
natural textures; CorelDepth, for creating 3-D logos and text; and CorelMemo, which allows
users to attach notes to their drawings or documents. The upgrade also includes Adobe Systems
Inc.'s Photoshop-compatible plug-in filters. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For the Internet, CorelDRAW 7 allows users to assign URLs to any object and publish documents
in HTML or Corel Barista, which lets them create documents in the Java programming language.
The upgrade offers users a direct link in its Help menu to Corel's Web site. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Corel's new Barista Java-applet authoring technology lets publishers create documents based
entirely on Java and thus playable on any Java-equipped computer. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In a few words, CorelDRAW 7 has gotten far better than the version number indicates. Perhaps
the best feature is the ingenious context-sensitive Property Bar (toolbar), which gives you
immediate access to the bulk of the program's features because it changes depending on the tool
or object you've selected. Moreover, Corel has grouped functions in this version to save effort;
for example, I found text-formatting options in one dialog box instead of the three required when
using CorelDRAW 6. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In Version 7, tools work more intuitively. I dragged and dropped colors, styles, clip art, fills, and
outlines from their respective palettes to objects. Further, the interactive Fill tool let me apply a
standard or custom gradation by just clicking and dragging over an object. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Similarly, the interactive Transparency tool helped me produce marvelous looks by placing
semitransparent texture on both vector and bit-map objects. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Text controls have more publishing features such as drop caps, vertical justification, and
automatic paragraph sizing that fits text into an existing frame. CorelDRAW also includes the
WordPerfect spelling checker, thesaurus, and grammar checker. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Ever since CorelDRAW 4, users have screamed for more speed, a request that is met in this
version. Running Version 7 on a 166-MHZ Pentium-based 166mhz system with Windows 95,
screen redraws, file imports, and file operations often finished in half the time it took with Version
6. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Many special effects are new or show improvement. Accelerated blending let me add highlights to
an object so it appeared more shiny. I had an easier time converting vector illustrations to bit
maps and applying special effects (such as noise or emboss) that are shared with Photo-Paint. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Document management functions, such as linked color relationships (where the color of a main
object is associated with subordinate components), provided a quick way to edit complex
illustrations. This recoloring, along with creating styles and using find-and-replace options, was
easily executed by following various wizards or using tabbed dialogs. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Several important high-end output options make their debut in CorelDRAW 7, including the
Pantone Hexachrome color palette and Kodak ColorSync 2.0 color management system. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>I had no trouble using the Internet toolbar to assign a URL and alternate text to objects. In
addition, I published documents to HTML, GIF, JPEG, or Barista (Corel's Java technology). 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Photo-Paint 7, like CorelDRAW, benefits from a new Property Bar and better internal memory
management. And you can adjust virtual memory, which further helps when dealing with large
files. Photo-Paint shares components with CorelDRAW, such as interactive gradient fill, color
modeling, and printing enhancements. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Photo-Paint's Image Sprayer tool, akin to the "hose" in Fractal Design Painter, let me spray one
image onto another to produce realistic skin textures. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For Webmasters, creating server-side and client-side image maps is a quick process using
Photo-Paint's Tag WWW command. All the necessary image export options are available, such as
progressive JPEG, GIF animation, and PNG. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Corel Dream 3D has fewer changes, but it's a useful program. Modifying 3-D objects is easier,
because you can now lock pieces of a model or slide them along an axis. Deformation tools
(stretch, shatter, bend, and twist) provide ways of altering models. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>During rendering you have more control over ambient light with CorelDRAW 7. There's a Cloudy
Fog atmosphere, and you can use reflected backgrounds. For the World Wide Web, Corel Dream
3D exports to Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML). 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Additional Features &amp; Utilities: </strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Kodak Digital Science Color Management System ensures accurate color representation during
scanning, display and printing using ColorSync 2.0-compatible device profiles.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Corel TEXTURE is a powerful tool for creating realistic natural textures such as wood, marble,
clouds, stone or metal. Every texture is defined by several material layers and custom lighting
effects.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Corel OCR-TRACE is a bitmap-to-vector conversion utility. Scanned images can be converted to
editable CorelDRAW illustrations. Enhanced OCR capabilities allow for direct text-editing.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Corel MULTIMEDIA MANAGER allows for visual organization of all the files on your desktop
and is also ideal for browsing the thousands of clipart images, symbols and photo libraries in
CorelDRAW 7.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>CorelDEPTH is an easy-to-use utility that allows you to apply instant 3D effects to your text and
graphics.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>CorelSCAN is a new wizard-based scanning utility with preset processing options. You may also
save scanning settings for future use when scanning similar images.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Corel CAPTURE allows you to capture the application window, or elements of the window such
as menu lists, toolbars or flyouts. You can also define rectangular, elliptical or freehand areas to
be captured.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Corel SCRIPT Editor is an OLE 2.0-enabled scripting application that is ideal for creating add-on
utilities for CorelDRAW or Corel PHOTO-PAINT.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>32,000 clipart images and symbols, 1,000 photos, 1,000 TrueType  and Type 1 fonts, over 750
floating objects, over 450 CorelDRAW templates and 250 3D models 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>And...Support for industry-standard labels, bar codes, document annotation and more.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>CorelDRAW 7 (as was version 6, and to a lessor extent version 5) created for the professional
illustrator, graphic artist and desktop publisher. If you are not one of these type of users, then I
would not suggest that you buy this product. It is memory intensive (requirements are a minimum
of 16 MB, but they recommend 32 MB for maximum performance). You need a Pentium 120 or
better to run it and a minimum of 40 MB of hard drive space. If you use your PC to make flyers,
banners, and newsletters, I would recommend a program such as Microsoft Publisher. It's easy to
use and comes with a lot of ready-made templates to get your document going fast.

<p>CorelDRAW 7 is priced at $695. Users of any version of CorelDRAW can upgrade for $249. I
recommend that if you do not already have an older version of CorelDRAW, that you seek out
one of the earlier versions; I have seen CorelDRAW 3 for about $50. Buy it, and then make the
upgrade to version 7. You'll save money and get the new version at the upgrade price. I am not
making recommendations or naming names, but I have seen some mail order companies sell the
product at the upgrade price without asking for verification on whether you own an older version
or not. So, as with everything, it is important to shop around and find the best price.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>On last bit of information. My sources at Corel say that there will not be a version 7 upgrade for
the Mac. Instead, they will wait until version 8 is released; and yes, there will also be a new
Windows version as well. Yikes, not another upgrade!

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><pre>Minimum System Requirements:

Windows 95 or  NT 4.0 Operating System, a Pentium 60 (Pentium 120
recommended), 16 MB RAM (32 recommended), VGA graphics (SVGA
recommended), a Double-speed CD-ROM drive, Sound Blaster or 100%
compatible sound card, Minimum 40 MB of hard disk space to install
CorelDRAW, Help and filters, and a Mouse.

<title>Gifts In Mac OS </title>

<body text="#000000" link="#0000ff" vlink="#551a8b" alink="#ff0000" bgcolor="#c0c0c0">
<h2><strong>Gifts In Mac OS </strong></h2>
<h3>By Tif Bailey</h3>

<p><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Tis the season to think about gifts. The Mac Operating System comes with many built-in features
that people often overlook. So much time is spent in a specific application concentrating on
completing a task that an occasional review of basic features can be helpful.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>First, at the upper right of the screen, don't forget the Apple Guide at the boxed question mark.
Well written applications will offer "Balloon Help" in addition to a user guide that is generously
indexed and searchable by key words. When activated, Balloon Help will offer captioned text at
any action that the Mac can do when the curser passes over a "hot button" or menu item. The
Apple Guide is a detailed desktop reference on how to do things. There is also a "Shortcuts"
menu items that covers many tips on navigating through the finder, folders and files.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>On the upper left corner of the screen is the "Apple Menu" drop down list. It is usually pre-loaded
with access to many items that may be useful with any application. Other applications or files can
be added to the "Apple Menu" by making an alias of the application icon, file or folder. This alias
is then placed in the "Apple Menu " folder inside the System folder. An alias of an item is made by
highlighting(single mouse click), then typing Command-M or using the Make Alias menu item
under File when one is at the desktop or finder level. Too many instructions? Newer Macs
automate this task with an Apple Script instruction "Add alias to Apple Menu." The item to be
added has to be highlighted first for the script to work. Apple Scripts can be found under the
Apple in the "Automated Tasks" folder. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Also on the left, under the Apple, is the Jigsaw Puzzle. Don't like the picture, just paste any Pict
file into the puzzle. How to get a Pict file? The key sequence Command-Shift-3 will capture a
screen shot that can be opened with any Paint &amp; Draw program and even "Simple Text." The
screen shots are named "Picture #" with the # being the number of the shot. The sound of a
shutter gives feedback that the screen shot worked. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Simple Text, which is standard on any Mac, is not so simple anymore. It can play "Quick Time"
movies, sounds alone, as will as open Pict files. Text files, with the correct code phrases and
markings, can even be read by Web browsers. People were using Simple Text to write the
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) before there were special application programs to do it.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The "Calculator" under the Apple is a straight forward four function machine which can be used
any time. What is handy is that the resultant number can be "cut/copied" and "pasted" into any
other document. For example, while typing a complaint letter a column of figures needs to be
added, just start up calculator, add the numbers and paste the result back in the letter. No need

<p>to open a spread sheet or find a hand held four banger.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The "Chooser" is used to set up printer drivers and local network connections. At home, once set,
it doesn't need to be altered. Appleshare is started from the Chooser. With the purchase of "local
talk" connectors, two or more Macs can be connected together to pass information or play games.
At work, Chooser and Appleshare are used to connect to corporate wide servers and printing
resources with appropriate ID and password security measures. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Launcher enables the design of a "palette" window with icons for frequently used applications,
documents, etc. Dragging an application, document, etc. to the palette will create a "button" for
it. Holding the Command key while clicking in the colored background area will allow the size of
the buttons to be changed to either small, medium or large. The "Launcher Items" folder in the
System Folder contains the alias files for all installed buttons. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Creating folders within the Launcher Items folder, and placing a bullet(Option-8) at the beginning
of its name, will create different categories or "layers" of buttons, with "tabs" to select the layers.
Removing a launcher button can be done by holding down the Option key, clicking on the button
and dragging it to the trash.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Note Pad, under the Apple, is exactly that. A place to write quick notes. It opens faster than an
organizer or a contact program. Take notes on a phone conversation and transfer them later to the
contact file.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Near the bottom of the Apple Menu items are the "Recent Applications" and "Recent Documents"
and even "Recent Networks." The contents of these holders are aliases of items the name implies.
Going into Recent Documents is a handy way to return to the last project that was in use. Did
somebody else use the MAC and what did they do with it? Checking these three folders will
usually indicate what was done. The number of recent items tracked is controlled by the count
setting in the "Apple Menu Options" control panel.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Apple Menu is a quick gateway to the Control Panels folder. Some applications or external
devices may have their own control panels. These would be set by following instructions in the
user guide that came with the program or device. Many Control Panels can be opened once,
conditions set and then forgotten. Other Control Panels that affect the visual interface in every
application and the Finder are worth reviewing. Some are just plane fun. Two the "Extensions
Manager" and Auto Power On/Off were discussed in a previous column in some depth. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Those that are just plane fun are: Desktop Patterns, Labels, Map, Sound, Speech, and Quick Time
Settings. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Control Panel "Desktop Patterns" sets the background texture or image. Open the control
panel and browse the pre-configured patterns or add one yourself. Any image or icon on the
"Clipboard" can be pasted into the Desktop Pattern Control Panel. However, some icons may
make it harder to see files or other icons on the desktop. There are even shareware sets of
desktop patterns available for holiday periods or other events.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Labels Control Panel is not about address labels, it is a tool to help organize files and
applications. When using the Finder any highlighted file can be given a label color by clicking on
the "label" menu. Changing the words associated a color is done with the Labels Control Panel.
Files can be located with "Find File" by color. Don't remember the name of that 6 month

<p>old "Hot" project that was labeled red. Just search for all "red" files. Another handy use is to label
all files in the System, Preference, and Extension folder a specific color named a specific date.
Later, after installing a new program it is easy to tell what has been changed by the installer. New
files will not have any overall color. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Map control panel tells the MAC its location so that local time for that time zone can be set.
Once set the time in another city can be determined. A phone call in the middle of the night is not
usually appreciated. It is also handy to calculate the great circle distance between two cities in
nautical or statue(ordinary) miles. The Map arrives with a black and white which can be replaced
with a color map by cutting and pasting the world map from the Scrap Book.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>From the original Mac Plus, sound capability has been a standard feature. The Sound Control
Panel sets the volume and gives a choice of alert sounds. The "beep" can be replaced by another
standard sound or almost anything else from shareware files. Newer Macs allow choosing input
and output sound sources. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Also "text-to-speech" capability has been added. The Sound Control Panel allows a choice of
"voices" and the rate of play. Highlighted text within Simple Text can be read aloud. Even some
e-mail programs have this feature.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Quick Time Settings Control Panel determines when a CD will begin playing; upon insertion
or later. Not all CD's have this feature but more are being produced that have it. There is also a
check box for starting CD's automatically in track number order.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Scrapbook is the repository for pictures, sounds, quicktime movies, and text. Cut or copied items,
that are temporarily stored in the clipboard, can be pasted in the Scrapbook for permanent
retention. They will still be there after the Mac is shutdown and restarted for use in new
documents. Items in the clipboard will be lost at shutdown.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>That covers the most of the Apple Menu and fun-type control panels supplied with all Macs.
Another time, the other control panels will be discussed.

<h2><strong>Tips For Using the Internet to Find A Job</strong></h2>
<h3>By William Franklin</h3>

<p><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The air is brisk with winter's approach and for many here of you, it's a time, once again, to find a
job. Yes, as surely as January follows December, the approaching start of a new calendar year
finds many employers giving pink slips just before or right after the Thanksgiving/Christmas
holiday season. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This being a presidential election year as well, the economy may go through some major changes,
depending on who wins, before the end of the year. Recent U.S. Labor Department figures have
shown that unemployment  has reached a seven year low.  Even so, a 5.1% unemployment rate
still means a lot of people are out of work.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you're one of the unlucky folks to find yourself job seeking during the holidays. This time
around, though, skip the help wanted ads and start searching the Internet -- you just might be able
to find gainful employment by New Year's Eve.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Internet is fast coming into its own as an effective tool for job seekers and companies looking
for qualified employees.  In fact, more  than 300,000 people per month have been accessing The
Monster Board (see below), a leading career hub on the Internet with access to more than 50,000
job openings, to look for career  opportunities.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A recent survey of 525 unemployed Americans showed that 19% logged on to the Internet to
look for work.  More importantly, applicants  recorded an  average of 5.6 job leads and 1.2
interviews from their online efforts.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>You can easily search any of the major search engines such as Yahoo, Excite, Magellan, Web
Crawler etc using key words like employment, jobs, job hunting, and careers. The result of that
search will be a list of sites you can visit to view information and classified on finding that perfect
job. We've put together a list of some of the more popular job help sites on the web for you here.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The best place to start a search for work on the Net is a service maintained by Ohio State
University called the Business Job Finder (http://www.cob. ohio-state.edu/dept/fin/osujobs.html).
In addition to the help you can get from this site, it also lists no less than 58 other great sites,
many of which have respectable listings for opportunities in many professions. It also connects to
13 different university career centers.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Business Job Finder breaks into Accounting, Commercial Banking, Corporate Finance,
Insurance, Real Estate, and several other specific related categories. These categories also have
links to a few employer home pages to help you learn more about a specific company and to get
advice on getting into business school. If you're beyond that stage, go to the Job Search sites and
start exploring. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Monster Board (http://www.monster.com) is another great resource, not just because it has a
database of more than 5,000 jobs but because it contains a great tutorial for putting together an
online resume. You can comb the database with the Career Search feature, which allows, in an
easy to navigate format, different kinds of search filters.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Career Mosaic (http://www.career mosaic.com) is one of the better resources out there. Whereas
most jobs to be found on the Internet focus on technical  jobs -- UNIX programmers, IS
managers, and the like -- Career Mosaic appears to have the greatest variety in its professional
database. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SHS Careers Front Page (http://www.shsinc.com), Sponsored by SHS (Chicago, Illinois), is a
nationwide employment resource offering online job openings updated daily, specializing in
telecommunications and medical communications positions. No fees to applicants.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>HelpWanted.Com (http://www.help wanted.com) is quite good.  HelpWanted has a terrific
database of listings and a good search engine.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Careerpath.com (http://www.careerpath.com/) lets you search employment ads (more than
20,000) from six major cities's newspapers including; The San Jose Mercury News, The Boston
Globe, The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times and The Washington
Post.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Recruiting-Links.Com (http://www.recruiting-links.com/) operated by SkillSearch Corporation
uses a relational database to provide direct links to Web-based employment opportunities.
Individuals can search based on any combination of over 700 location, industry, and job
categories. This is free to the user.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>CareerCat (http://www.chisoft.com/cgi-win/ccat.exe/form)  provided by Chicago Software
Newspaper, lists a lot of software job openings for Chicago area.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>America's Job Bank (http://www.ajb.dni.us/) has about 120,000 listings from the 1,800 state
Employment Service offices from around the nation. You can search regionally and by career
field.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Careerpath.com (http://www.careerpath.com/): You don't need to buy a newspaper to check out
the job classifieds. This site lets you search classified employment ads from six participating
newspapers: the Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times, New York Times, San Jose
Mercury News, and Washington Post. Enter a job type to see listings frequently posted before the
printed version reaches the streets. The service would be of limited value to anyone interested in
jobs outside of the regions covered. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>E-Span: (http://www.espan.com/): E-Span has one of the most practical interfaces of all the
career-oriented Web sites we looked at, E-Span guides you through an interview process to
gauge your professional interests, salary requirements, years of relevant experience, and so on. It
then searches its database for U.S. job openings most appropriate for you. We were able to find
dozens of corporate job listings in categories such as sales, marketing, management, and
engineering. You'll also find company profiles, salary guides, and advice on how to create both
electronic and paper resumes. E-Span also has a similar forum on CompuServe (go career).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Internet's Online Career Center: (http://www.occ.com/occ/): The clean, no-frills interface is
perfect for career seekers who want to find the right job fast. When you log onto the Online
Career Center's home page, you'll find a handy search tool for locating job openings by industry,
state, and city. You can also e-mail your resume to the OCC, which will post it in its resume bank
where it can be seen by corporate recruiters.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This one is for all the new lawyers out there. 

<p>West's Legal Directory (http://www.wld.com): West Publishing Company is one of the leading
legal publishers in the country. Its site offers numerous services to attorneys (for a fee), but its
West's Legal Directory is a free, comprehensive directory of law firms, government offices,
corporate law offices, and lawyers. The highly customizable search engine lets you find a lawyer
in the U.S. for your exact needs. The directory offers a resume-like profile of each lawyer.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Another good source for employment information are the Newsgroups on USENET. Newsgroups
are sort of a combination chat group/electronic bulletin board. A user can subscribe to various
newsgroups and post messages and announcement as well as read what others are saying and also
receive email from them. Here's a list of just a few of the many employment related newsgroups.
<pre>(news:misc.jobs.offered) misc.jobs.offered 
(news:misc.jobs.offered.entry) misc.jobs.offer.entry
(news:misc.jobs.misc) misc.jobs.misc
(news:misc.jobs.resumes) misc.jobs.resumes
(news:us.jobs.offer) us.jobs.offer
(news:us.jobs.resumes) us.jobs.resumes
(news:dc.jobs) dc.jobs &lt;Washington D.C. Jobs&gt;.      


</pre>

<p>Hope this information helps you find the perfect job. Good luck on your search.

<title>Career Toolbox Available!</title>

<h2><strong>Career Toolbox Available!</strong></h2>
<h3>By A. Accetta</h3>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Chivas Regal, the big-time scotch whiskey maker,  is offering a "free" multimedia CD-ROM
(shipping and handling is extra) titled "Career Toolbox" that offers a series of presentations on
furthering careers and improving job performance. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The CD-ROM-compatible with 486 multimedia PCs with Windows 3.1 or higher and 68040
Macintoshes with 8 MB's of RAM-uses videos, sound and text to guide viewers through four
career sections: 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>What's a Scotch company got to offer a job seeker? More than you might have imagined. The
program's four sections (Landing the Job You Deserve, Improving Your Professional Situation,
Making Your Cash Work Harder and Doing Your Own Thing) feature articles from Entrepreneur
magazine, interactive seminars with career counselors, diagnostic self-tests, and workshops
covering management techniques, starting your own business, salary negotiation and more. A
brief overview of each section follows: 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><pre><strong>Section one</strong> is entitled, "Get Noticed: Landing the Job You Deserve."
Included are "20 Hot Jobs for the '90s," "What Employers Really Want"
and "Best Job-Finding Tactics." 

<strong>Section two:</strong> "It's Your Move: Improving Your Professional Situation,"
offers advice on being a leader and on how to run a meeting. 

<strong>Section three</strong> is titled "Making Your Cash Word Harder"; it provides
financial advice. 

<strong>Section four </strong>is "Doing Your Own Thing," which covers
entrepreneurialism. 


</pre>

<p>Some of the advice given is simplistic and generic. A profile of entrepreneurs listed a tea-store
proprietor in Arizona and an acupuncturist in California. Would-be entrepreneurs are instructed to
look up the Yellow Pages to check out competition.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The disc also sheds light on telecommuting, finding a career counselor and coping with job stress; 
and there's a forward-thinking section on emerging jobs in cyberspace, including digital journalist
and cyber-librarian. Resume templates and record-keeping software round out the package. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As to why Chivas Regal, a high-end Scotch whisky maker, would sponsor a CD-ROM on
employment, the company says the "Career Toolbox further reinforces a brand name universally
identified with accomplishment and achievement."  Parents of teenagers who might peruse this
presentation should be forewarned that the bottle and brand name are prominently displayed
throughout the CD-ROM. If you find this objectionable, it would be best to bypass the offer. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>"Career Toolbox" is available for the price of shipping and handling ($4.95, plus an extra $1.20
for Californians) by calling (800) 244-8271. One alternative is to look up the companion Web site,
http://www.careertoolbox.com, which features portions of the CD-ROM content and weekly tips,
including how to write a cover letter, tactics for job hunters and resource lists for home
businesses. <strong></strong>

<p> <h2><strong>Look Before You Leap: Plan Your Job Changes With
Care</strong></h2>
<h3>By Trish Roberts</h3>

<p><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Career changes can be quite daunting if you haven't planned for them. Let's say that you have
identified some new career opportunities and have been through a series of interviews with several
companies, and are now ready to evaluate all of the job offers that you have received. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Where should you start in order to determine which is the best job for you to accept for your
personal career path?  I've put together a few suggestions that will help you to decide which job
offer to accept.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Begin by reviewing the company's past and present success as it relates to your experience and
future career goals. Ask yourself the following questions: 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><pre>1.  Do they have a good reputation in the marketplace? 
2.  Do they value their employees? 
3.  Does the job description match what you are searching for in a
    career change? 
4.  Do you fit in? If possible, ask to visit the area you are
    considering working in to meet with the employees; ask them about
    the position and get a feel for them as well. Would they be 
    people you would like working with? 
5.  Review your short-term and long-term personal and career goals. 
6.  Determine if the company's goals are in line with your present
    and future career growth path? Does the position define and meet
    your goals? 
7.  Does the position look like it has room for advancement? Have the
    management staff been promoted from the ranks or been recruited
    from outside the company? 
8.  Examine what the company may be looking for in you: Determine
    what your duties will be and whether you are capable of
    adequately performing them 
9.  Review the management staff and their policies. Do you see
    eye-to-eye with the management staff? Can they help you in your
    career? Are you comfortable with their style and professional
    accomplishments?
10. Review your financial status: Are you looking to make a career
    move for a substantial pay increase or to gain experience for
    further advancement down the road? How much will this career
    change cost you? Will the new company pay moving expenses? Will
    you be able to easily sell your home or purchase a new one, etc?
11. If you have a family, how will this career move effect them? Will
    it mean pulling your son out of school in his senior year or
    forcing your spouse to give up their own career?
12. Review the job offer. Make sure you fully understand the 
    compensation plan as well as the benefits being offered. Ask
    until you fully understand each detail.
13. Review your past experience, training received and future
    advancement. Have you risen to your current level because you
    have received valuable training or education? Did you personally
    incur the cost? If so, then you know how valuable and costly this
    training can be. Don't discount any training or educational
    compensation that may be offered because you don't think that you
    need it. Perhaps there will be valuable, costly training you will
    receive that will advance your employment status rather than a
    monetary reward that doesn't boost your career experience.

</pre>

<p>Ultimately the decision to make a career change is yours'. Review and question all of the details
until you feel comfortable with your decision.

<title>A Career Plan: Reach Your Goal Through ForesightAnd Organization</title>

<p> <h2><strong>A Career Plan: Reach Your Goal Through Foresight
And Organization</strong></h2>
<h3>By Bill Franklin</h3>

<p><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Knowing when it's time to change jobs is a difficult decision. It can be an extremely stressful
episode that may lead to the wrong decision. What if the new job turns out not to be the stepping
stone to advancement but a huge dead end? What if you decide to stay where you are and current
position turns goes nowhere?  Some might say that each new job gains vital experience towards
the "right one", but what this wandering from company to company really does is create
inconsistency in your achievements and actually reduces your progress towards the skills needed
to realize your true potential. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A well-thought-out career plan will help you to avoid wandering aimlessly through the job jungle,
hoping the next one will be that "right opportunity" where you'll be happy and successful. To
successfully orchestrate your career, the plan must include a destination and a road map. As an
example, you wouldn't head out on a trip to Canada by just heading north would you? No, you
would do some research, get a good map and highlight the best route to take you to where you
wanted to go. The logistics of planning your career isn't much different than this.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Your destination should be a specific job within your industry-for example, Managing Editor for a
respected magazine. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Your research should map out all of the jobs you must have to reach your destination. Not just
the job titles, but all the skills and experience you must gain in order to perform well in your
destination dream job. These levels of skill and experience are the "stops along the way." that you
must make to obtain the desired position. Granted you might be able to skip a stop or two along
the way, just as you can skip a gas station on a trip, it is better to know the stop is there if needed
than to drive blindly hoping to find the next station.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As, as you plan for your trip, you do many things to bring all of the components together. You
make sure the car is well-tuned, pack all of your maps, and perhaps learn from the experiences of
others who have made the trip before. Planning for your career is very similar. Your career
components are your acquired skills, experience and strengths and you can learn a great deal
about your desired position from recruiters who work in your industry specialty, and mentors who
will keep you from running off of the road. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Do not be afraid to ask these experienced folks for directions. Learning such things as what skills
and experience did they acquire to get where they are; what types of positions did they hold; what
else would they learn if they were in your position today; what new language, business or
technical skills will the changing marketplace require? Granted some people may not want to
share their secrets to success and may see you as a someone who covets there position. Here I
offer a suggestion of caution; if you receive a negative reply or bad vibes the first time you try to
discuss these matters with a person, don't press it. Go on to the next possible source.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Anyone who has ever driven across country knows that for a long ride you must pace yourself,
and that staying within the pack offers some protection. In a career situation this can mean don't
change jobs too quickly. There will always be opportunities for talented specialists. Conversely,
don't hang back in the pack and get trapped in the slow lane. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you think you are prepared for a better position, look both ways, step on the gas and go for it .

<title>Searching For A Career By Using The Internet: ProsAnd Cons </title>

<body text="#000000" link="#0000ff" vlink="#551a8b" alink="#ff0000" bgcolor="#c0c0c0">

<p> <h2><strong>Searching For A Career By Using The Internet: Pros
And Cons </strong></h2>
<h3>By Trish Roberts</h3>

<p><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>You've decided to make a career change and want to use the Internet to do some job searches.
Lots of people are using the Internet (mainly the World Wide Web) as a standard part of their job
searching procedures. Here I have put together some pros and cons on using the web to obtain
job and career information. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Net job search pros: </strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><pre>1.  Many companies now have web sites. This allows a user to learn
    about the company, find out where their offices are located and
    in many instances, learn about employment opportunities with that
    company.

2.  Another plus to using the web to job search is that there is
    immediate access to nationwide  employment classifieds with
    salary information, as well as the company profile. That
    information can help determine your actual interest in the
    corporation. 

    Some sites on the web allow you to post your resume in national  

    database so corporations and recruiting firms can view your      

    experience and contact you directly for their available          

    positions. 

4.  Your job search can be done at any time of the day or night from 

    your home or office. 

5.  The web offers speed and the ability to do "market saturation"   

    quickly at little cost: Any number of resumes can be sent over   

    the modem without ever dialing a fax machine or printing and     

    sending resumes by mail. 

6.  The web and email allow for follow-up information to be completed

    on-line. 

7.  A user can visit hundreds of sites in a day, from the comfort of 

    their own home. Thereby saving time and expenses for traveling to

    and from various employment agencies and or sites by conventional

    means.


</pre>

<p><strong>Net job search cons:</strong> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><pre>1. For the most part, there is no actual human contact. You don't get

   to speak to anyone to "sell" your past success and tout the       

   strength that you can bring to the hiring organization or even    

   discuss the highlights of your resume. Your resume must be your   

   only selling feature. 

2. Not all of the job postings within an organizations may be posted,

   and the ones posted may sometimes be put-dated. 

3. You run the risk that job listings have not been updated on a     

   continual basis (the position you are applying for may have been  

   filled a month ago, but the Webmaster hasn't updated the home     

   page) 

4, In some instances, the cost of Internet service needs to be       

   addressed. If you have unlimited service, great. If you pay by the

   hour, then the success or failure of what you find could cost you 

   money.


</pre>

<p>Conclusions:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Use the Internet for what it is, a tool to gain information. Do not make it the only method with
which you search for a new position. Combining use of the Internet along with the traditional job
search methods will not only enhance your career search, but it will be an eye-opener to the
infinite number of job opportunities available not only locally, but across the country and the
world. Good Luck on your search.

<title>My Virtual Career </title>
</head>
<body text="#000000" link="#0000ff" vlink="#551a8b" alink="#ff0000" bgcolor="#c0c0c0">
<h2><strong>My Virtual Career </strong></h2>
<h3><strong>By Robert Penny</strong></h3>

<p><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For most of my earlier life my major goal was to get a job with a big company, move up the
ladder and retire after thirty years with a nice pension. After college I did get the right job and
moved along my career path in the computer industry. However, somewhere along the way, the
path was damaged by a mudslide called down-sizing. Before I knew it, the path was gone and so
was my position. At 38 I wondered what to do with the rest of my life. Then it hit me that with
the advent of the Internet and the rise of "virtual offices" my career wasn't over, it was just
beginning. 

<p>While having a career used to mean advancing through a particular profession, usually within the
ranks of one particular company. Today a "virtual career" can have all the same challenges and
rewards as a "real job," but it may take on a totally different look and feel. In my new virtual
career, just about everything changes. My corporate office is no replaced by a home-office or
when I am in the field, by no office at all. The old boss/worker relationship has been replaced by
strategic alliances and the ever changing needs of my clients on a daily basis. My old loyalty to the
firm has been replaced by my own commitment to work and my clients. Promotions now mean
bigger and more meaningful contracts with clients, and the chain of command by hierarchy is
replaced by task outlined in a contract. My job description and title are replaced by a portfolio of
skills and roles, and the academic degrees that got me that old job are now replaced by my
continuing ability to learn new things every day. My virtual career requires me to manage my time
and resources to handle multiple clients and to be able to switch efforts back and forth between
clients in the same day. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>While in my old position I thought of the goals of the company and how my position fit it to those
goals, I know think globally, and seek opportunities to market myself to companies around the
world. My old full-time, 9-5, "real job" has been replaced by full or part-time temporary
assignments and crazy hours; remember when it's midnight on the east coast, it's already the next
morning in Europe.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As a consultant, I usually meet my clients in their offices, or through tele-conferences, and most
recently through video-conferencing on the world wide web. Sometimes the only contact I have
with a client is through e-mail. I even have "virtual" employees who live around the world, some
of which I have never met, doing projects under contract to me for many different clients. In
addition, some of the clients I do work for have no direct employees but have outsourced all of
their work to other companies; in-effect, becoming "virtual employers".

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>I think that as we approach the 21<sup>st</sup> Century, the growth of virtual careers, and home offices will
grow at a tremendous rate. The Internet has made a great deal of this possible. As we improve
and refine our use of the Internet it will continue to do so for some time to come. By using a
modern and the technologies of e-mail, fax machines, computer, word-processing software,
spreadsheets, databases, graphics and outsourced copying at business centers, I can operate from
virtually any location desired by the client. More often than not, I can work from a spare bedroom
in my own home. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Of course, it's not enough to just start a virtual career, you need to have business contacts and 
strategic alliances. If you're lucky, you can still keep some contact with the company that you
once worked for. Many of my jobs come from contacts at the old firm, and indeed, I am
sometimes asked to do work for my old company on a consulting basis as well. The adage, "It's
not what you know, but who you know" is still very valid. You might also try spreading your new
found career through the Internet by setting up a web page that details your services. You can
then promote it at search engine sites such as Yahoo and Excite. Many people use these search
engines to find what they need; if you're lucky, they will find you.. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In today's global economy  companies are now creating teams of personnel from within and
among organizations in which results depend on cooperation and collaboration among the
members. The key to accomplishing a task is becoming less a function of the strength of a team
and more a function of the strength of the links among the teams. The links are determined by the
agreements among the teams and the strategic personnel who support and enforce those
agreements. In turn, the agreements are only as strong as the professional alliances that are
developed among strategic personnel on the teams. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>I'm no longer in a position that will provide me continuos employment for life, as I had hoped my
old position would do, but I am experiencing a great deal of life and many times making more
money for less work than my previous job.  When all of the pluses and minus are equaled out,  I
won't say that having a virtual career is 100% better than my old full-time position. I will however
go as far as to say that in many aspects the work I am now doing is more rewarding
professionally; in the sense that I feel more productive and in charge of my life, my career and my
future.

<h2><strong>Home Office Tips, Tricks and Updates</strong></h2>
<h3>By A, Accetta</h3>

<p><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In February, Microsoft is planning to release a version of Office 97 designed to meet the needs of
the small-business/home office user. Office 97 Small Business Edition is the result of Microsoft's
research, which indicated that small-business users seek applications that meet different needs
than those of the corporate market. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Office 97 Small Business Edition suite will offer core office products Word 97 and Excel 97,
as well as Outlook 97, a new application in the Office 97 edition that combines personal
information management, such as scheduling, a calendar, and a task manager, with contact
management and e-mail client capabilities. Outlook 97 serves as the central application in all of
the Office 97 suite editions. It replaces Schedule+ 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>What differs in the small-business suite, as compared with standard Office 97, is that Microsoft
Publisher 97 replaces PowerPoint 97 presentation software; small businesses often have desktop
publishing needs, such as brochures, letterheads and marketing materials. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The small-business suite also features AutoMap Streets Plus, a street-level mapping title that
incorporates American Business Information's Yellow Pages telephone and address directory.
AutoMap Streets Plus is offered in place of the Access 97 database title. Pricing of the Office 97
Small Business Edition suite is the same as Office 97 Standard Edition. Both have a $249
estimated street price with a $40 rebate offered to current Microsoft software users. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>New Software Helps the Home Office User:</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Magic Cap for Windows 95: Consider it your private secretary in a box. Magic Cap ($49,
Windows 95 CD-ROM) handles all your communications needs--shoot off faxes and e-mail,
schedule meetings or browse the Internet, all with a few clicks of the mouse. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>You'll find an integrated fax machine, appointment book, mailbox and address book on your
desktop. You can open the appointment book to schedule a meeting, and Magic Cap will
automatically send the invitations by e-mail or fax (culled from your address book). Or surf the
Web, then store what you find in the on-screen file cabinet.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Mailing and Tracking Your packages Just Got Easier</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>I know we all like to make fun of the Postal Service, but these days, snail mail doesn't creep along
at a glacial pace the way it used to. And when you use overnight services such as FedEx or UPS,
packages are just two steps behind your e-mail. But although most e-mail servers send error
messages when e-mail doesn't go through, I've never known FedEx to call when my package
didn't make it to its destination on time.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To make sure you're on top of your overnight service, get online. Both FedEx (www.fedex.com)
and UPS (www.ups.com) offer free tracking software and easy-to-use tracking services on their
Web sites. In addition, FedEx provides free shipping software to its customers. Just call
1-800-gofedex for info and the free software.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you want your office to run even more smoothly, check out Mindscape's Home Office
Assistant, a new bundle of utilities and reference works for small business. The package includes
shipping and tracking software, tools for designing and printing business stationery, and online
software for accessing full-service printing facilities, as well as detailed guidelines and templates
for creating a business plan. It may not be able to run errands for you, but it can do just about any
other office task.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Home Office Assistant: is available for Win 3.x; $35; from Mindscape; (800) 234-3088, (415)
897-9900; http://www. mindscape. com.

<h2><strong>PC Tips and Tricks</strong></h2>
<h3>By Herman Torres</h3>

<p><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This month I bring you a few tips and tricks for Windows 95 and also for your web browser.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>1. Save-As Trick </em>

<p>If you're using 32-bit Win95 applications, there are a few interesting things you can do in the Save
As dialog box  (Found by going to File/Save As). If you right-click your mouse in the dialog's
white space, you'll get the context menus for the folder you're currently working in. To cut, copy,
delete, rename and see the properties of individual files all you have to do is right-click on each
file and the information becomes available to you. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>2. Buried Taskbar?</em> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If there are times that you've got so many open windows that your taskbar is buried there is a
solution to the problem. All you need do is right-click on the taskbar (find a spot where there are
no tray icons or minimized app or folder buttons), select Properties and make sure there's a check
mark next to the "Always on Top" item. If time is of the essence, then the quick fix is to select
Ctrl+Esc. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>3. Start-Menu Reform</em> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Every time you install a new application the program menu that cascades off of your Start menu
gets larger and less manageable. Eventually, the menu gets way out of hand. To simplify this
mess, simply open the Programs menu by <strong>right-clicking</strong> on your Start button, now select Open
from the context menu, then double-click on the Programs folder. You can now move files around
and create more streamlined folder categories (much like the old program groups in Windows 3x).
Move all the program shortcuts you want to keep into the new folders by right-clicking on each in
turn and selecting Cut, then right-clicking on the appropriate new folder and selecting Paste.
Delete the rest. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>4. I've Got A Secret</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you've got something on your computer that you do not want others to see (files and even
folders full of files) just right-click on each file and select Hidden in the Attributes box at the
bottom of the Properties dialog. To see the files you've hidden, double-click on My Computer,
select Options from the View menu, click on the View tab and select Show All Files. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>5. <em>My 'Favorite' Browser Trick </em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you use both Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer, you can use your Netscape
Bookmarks from Explorer. Netscape stores bookmarks in an HTML document called
BOOKMARK.HTM. Add this file to your Explorer's Favorite Places folder by launching Internet
Explorer and typing into the Address box FILE: followed by the path to your
BOOKMARK.HTM file (the whole line will probably look like this: FILE:C:\PROGRAM
FILES\NETSCAPE\NAVIGATOR\BOOKMARK.HTM). Press Enter, then select Favorites/Add
To Favorites.

<title>MOUSE TALES: Old MACs and New Systems :Acolumn about the Macintosh  </title>

<p> <h2><strong>MOUSE TALES: Old MACs and New Systems</strong> :A
column about the Macintosh  </h2>
<h3>By George Herman</h3>

<p><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Visiting away from home, I am typing this on a borrowed SE-30. The SE-30 was one of the last
of the little Macs - CPU and screen together in one case, handle on top. I almost said that this was
one of the last to look like a Mac. The Macintosh is still the best kind of computer, but its
uniqueness nowadays is all in how it works. When it comes to looks, you can't count on picking
the Mac out of a computer store display from across the room. The crudest sketch of the Mac of
the old days is unmistakable. As much as new models differed inside, they all used to look about
the same. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This little SE has the same 9 inch, black and white screen that the first Macintosh had. Characters
and images are crisp and clear because it has 512 by 380 pixels in that small space, and it writes
the characters black on a white background. That is commonplace now, but when we saw the first
Mac in 1984, it was a revelation. Then it was just called Macintosh - no letters or numbers after
the name, because it was the only kind of Macintosh there was.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>When I get home again, I will sit down in front of a 14-inch color screen, which I would not give
up for anything (Well, perhaps for 20 inches). Nostalgia warms the heart, but I would not trade
my PowerMac for that first model with 128k of memory and no hard disk. Despite its bulk, its big
boxy shape and big color screen, my new machine is still a Macintosh. It has the point and click,
plug and play, menu controlled system that makes a Mac. Its operating system occupies just about
two million times as many bytes of memory as the first Mac had altogether, but it is the same
system at heart. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Systems have been much in the news lately, thanks to Windows 95, which makes a PC work like a
Macintosh 89. Not long ago Mac users were talking a lot about systems, too, asking each other
over coffee whether they were going to move up to System 7. Those who were using System 7
were telling the rest of us not to believe that stuff about being able to run it in 2 megabytes of
memory (128k, where are you now?). It seemed we could run System 7 in 2 megs, but couldn't
run much else at the same time! Now we are having the same conversations about 7.5. Some
users have installed it, some haven't, and some are still trying to make up their minds. System 7.5
takes 2.5 or 3 megs of memory for it's own use, about twice as much as 7.0. It occupies a
horrendous chunk of the hard disk, too. But it is pretty, if you can afford the space. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>One of 7.5's innovations is Apple Guide, a super help system that leads you by the hand through
whatever you ask it to help you with. Apple has decided that nobody reads manuals, I guess,
because the manual for my PowerMac is about a quarter-inch thick, and every section tells me
that if I want to know more, I should ask Apple Guide! 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Not everybody is thinking about installing 7.5, of course. There are still many owners of older
Macs (Pluses and Classics and such) using systems with numbers lower than 7.0. Software
manufacturers are behaving as if those folks either were not there or were not buying software.
And perhaps they are not buying, not even upgrading, holding to the "If it ain't broke, don't fix it"
philosophy. But the hardware and software manufacturers act like auto makers - new models of
everything once a year, or more often if they can manage it. 

<p>That's as true in the Mac market as it is for the PCs. I recall a quip in Wired magazine a while
back that went something like: "Every year Andy gives us more space and Bill uses it all up!" For
the Mac, of course, it isn't Intel giving and Microsoft taking away - it's Apple on both ends of the
game!

<h2><strong>A few interesting goodies that defy categorization </strong></h2>
<h3><strong>By Craig Crossman, Columnist</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Miami Herald</strong> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>I have a drawer into which I throw difficult-to-qualify items: products that are interesting but not
major enough for an entire column. Yet I don't want to simply toss them away. So they go into
the drawer in hopes that I'll find a clever way or a reason to tell you about them. It didn't happen
in 1996. So what better way to launch the new year than with a few of these interesting, useful
and strange computer goodies. Besides, my drawer is beginning to overflow.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>A little blue book</em> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>From Prentice Hall comes a paperback entitled The Original Internet Address Book. You guessed
it. Instead of a little black book, it's a little blue book, but you won't find used car prices in it. You
will find web sites for Chevrolet and Cadillac, as well as over 1,000 other sites and search engines
that the book's creator thinks you might find useful.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>I'm not sure how they arrived at these selections, but they include American Airlines, Career Path,
Dream Jobs, International Cigar Club, the White House and more.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>But more important, it's really a blank address book in which you can alphabetically write in the
sites that you frequent and wish to remember. Each address has a line for name, e-mail address,
URL, keyword and phone/fax. The $5.95 book is small and thin enough to slip into your jacket
pocket.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Timeless scenes </em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>What time is it? Any computer has a choice of clock displays, but how about looking at a
panoramic outdoor photo that replaces your desktop. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As time passes, the sun actually changes the way the view is displayed according to how it would
appear at the current moment! Sundial is billed as the "Original Time-Lapse Desktop."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>You can choose from California sequences such as the Golden Gate Bridge, Death Valley, Santa
Cruz marina, Mount Shasta, Marin County farm and others. Watching the sun rise and fall over
Mount Whitney just takes my breath away. If you don't get out much, this is a great way to keep
your circadian rhythm in sync. For Mac and Windows, $29.95.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Stop that thief </em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Worried that someone might steal your notebook computer? Portables are on any thief's top 10
list of items to acquire at airports and other public places. Don't be a victim. Get Secure Alert, an
anti-theft motion detector.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>About the size and shape of a luggage tag, Secure Alert ($24.95) is strapped to a portable
computer, briefcase or anything else you might be carrying and have to put down. If any motion
occurs, a 120-decibel alarm shrieks to warn you and everyone else that someone is making off
with your property. Arming and deactivating is done with push-button simplicity.

<p>Looking for way-cool graphics to decorate your web page? Check out Nova's Web Explosion
20,000, for $49.95. The two-CD set contains 20,000 royalty-free images that Nova says is the
world's largest collection of custom-designed images.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Included is an on-screen color image browser that makes it easy to select the image you want. Or
use the 124-page color catalog. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>There are thousands of click-on buttons, bullets, banners, dividers, sidebars, accents, backgrounds
and textures. You'll also find color photos and colorful letters you can use to label just about
anything.

<p><strong>Computer hacker plants porno on Air Force Web page: Military Web sites temporarily
shut down</strong>: A hacker pulled a prank on the U.S. Air Force Sunday, sneaking onto its Web site
and replacing a page of aviation statistics with a pornographic picture. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As a result, the Pentagon's "DefenseLINK" Web site, which includes about 80 home pages, was
shut down for more than 24 hours while officials ensured there were no other security breaches . 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The hackers apparently were able to wipe out one of the Air Force's pages and set up a dummy
page at the Web site address. (http://www.af.mil). Instead of containing facts and figures on
fighter jets and force strength, the page showed a photo of a man and two women involved in a
sex act. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Air Force said that the scene was put on the Net about 5 a.m. EST Sunday and removed by
11 a.m. All Defense Department Web sites were taken off line for about 24 hours while the
Pentagon checked their systems for other lapses in security. Air Force officials were apparently
made aware of the intrusion by members of the news media who had received anonymous phone
calls drawing their attention to the pornography.

<p><strong>U.S. Uncovers Over 500 Scams On World Wide Web</strong>: Federal, state and local law
enforcement agencies say they have found over 500 sites on the World Wide Web that may be
promoting illegal pyramid schemes. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The agencies conducted a sweep of the Internet on Dec. 9, dubbed "Internet Pyramid Surf Day,"
to find sites that lure consumers with false promises of big profits from a small initial investment.
"We're putting scam artists on notice," Jodie Bernstein, director of the Federal Trade
Commission's Bureau of Consumer protection, said. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>"The Internet is not going to be a new marketplace where scam artists roam free," Bernstein said.
The sites were sent warnings describing characteristics of illegal pyramid schemes by electronic
mail. The sites will be revisited and if evidence suggested they were illegal operations, further
action would be taken, the agencies said. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In addition to the FTC, bodies that participated were the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Federal Communications Commission, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, 20 state attorney generals,
five state securities regulators and four district attorneys. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Some sites promoted for-profit chain letters, a common scheme outside of cyberspace as well. 

<p>"Promoting chain letters on the Internet is simply putting old wine in new bottles," Chief Postal
Inspector Kenneth Hunter said. "Even though communicated via the latest telecommunications
medium, electronic chain letters are identical to old fashioned scams in that they are likely to
profit only the originator." 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The agencies also announced a consumer education campaign backed by leading Internet service
providers including AT&amp;T and America Online. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Federal Trade Commission said it put educational materials on its Web site at
http://www.ftc.gov/pyramid. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Better Business Bureau said it is also distributing materials on its Web site,
http://www.bbb.org, to advise consumers how to identify pyramid schemes and other online
scams.

<p><strong>IBM Offers Free Patent Data Base on Web</strong>: IBM plans to make the content of 2 million U.S.
patents (from 1971) available free on the Web site &lt; http://www.ibm.com/patents/ &gt;.  Various

<p>companies provide patent access for a fee;  one company, Questel-Orbit (a division of France
Telecom) charges $1,995 a year, and a company executive says:  "I still believe that we have the
most robust search engine."

<p><strong>Keeping an Eye on Things via the Net</strong>: Irvine, Calif.-based Wonderware Corp. has developed a

lawsuit against Microsoft, alleging that the electronic post-it notes feature in Microsoft's Office 97
software suite infringes on 3M's patent for its software version of the ubiquitous little squares of
paper that can be stuck on anything.  Office 97 users access the post-it feature by entering
"Post-it" or "3M Post-it."  3M says it hasn't approved the Microsoft product and isn't connected
in any way with it.

<p><strong>Web Spoofing Is No Joke</strong>: Researchers at Princeton University have released a paper
documenting ways that nefarious crackers could dupe unwitting Web browsers into divulging
personal information, such as bank personal identification numbers or credit card numbers.  One
way to do this is to break into a legitimate Web server and alter the links to other sites, so that
when users click to transfer, they're actually transported to the cracker's computer where the
virtual hijacker can watch every move they make (such as entering credit card info when
prompted).  The researchers suggest that Web surfers take the following precautions:  disabling
JavaScript in their Web browsing software; keeping an eye on the software's location line, to
ensure they know where they are; and paying close attention to the addresses they visit.

<p><strong>AOL Blocks Russian Access</strong>: America Online has shut down service in 40 cities in the former
Soviet Union, primarily in Russia, because of widespread incidents where fraudulent credit-card
numbers were used to access the service.  Last month, the company set up an Integrity Assurance
division to fight online fraud, and the company routinely denies access to those who log on using
fraudulent means.  AOL is not sure when service to Russia will resume:  "Until we feel
comfortable that we have an understanding of the problem, we're not prepared to put it back up,"
says Integrity Assurance's VP.

<p><strong>Incredible Shrinking Digital Disks: </strong>Hollywood studios have begun releasing some videos in a
high-resolution DVD (Digital Video Disk) format that offers much sharper picture-quality and
packages seven times as much data as existing CDs.   DVD player units will be available this
spring, at prices starting at about $500.  Later generations of DVDs will allow users to record
movies and computer data, but the first generation will be read-only;  computer-makers will also
be using the disks (which are sometime called Digital Versatile Disks), and Intel executives have
said all major computer manufacturers would introduce high-end DVD-based systems by the end
of the year, and that DVD-based systems for the general market will be available in 1998, on
machines using Intel's P6 processor and MMX multimedia technology.

<p><strong>Pager Madness:</strong> A technical glitch on January 9th caused the SkyTel paging network to send
erroneous call-me-back messages to more than 100,000 customers.  The problem was
exacerbated when some diligent subscribers returned the call and left their phone numbers so that
whoever had beeped them could call back.  The result was a 26-minute major phone traffic jam as
thousands of other SkyTel customers then called those numbers.  Apparently, the whole mess
started when a customer desiring a new PIN (personal identification number) was mistakenly
assigned one linked to a secret code that the company uses to beam Dow Jones News Service
information out to 100,000 customers.  The PIN, a seven-digit number that looked like a phone
number, was zapped to the Dow Jones subscribers, many of whom then tried to dial it as a local
call. Others recognized it as a PIN, and called SkyTel to retrieve the "caller's" number, jamming
the lines there.  "One frequency of our one-way nationwide network experienced an anomaly in
the database that caused customers to be paged erroneously," says a spokesman for SkyTel's
parent company, Mtel, which has apologized for the snafu.

<p><strong>FCC Designates Wireless Spectrum for Schools, Others</strong>: The Federal Communications
Commission has set aside 300 megahertz of spectrum for free, unlicensed, short-range wireless
communications by individuals, schools, hospitals and libraries.  Metricom's Ricochet network
already provides its subscribers with wireless data communications and Internet access using an
unlicensed portion of the radio spectrum.  The FCC anticipates similar services proliferating, as
well as educational and medical applications, such as teachers using the designated airwaves to
call up student background records and grades from the schools central database using handheld
machines or doctors calling up X-rays from a hospital database and ordering drugs from the

year.  The GTL+ bus will appear later this year on Pentium Pro chips with clock speeds of 300
MHz.  Meanwhile, the company will continue to enhance existing Pentium Pro processors that
use the 66-MHz internal bus -- in the next few months, Intel will introduce 233-MHz and

for them.  AOL estimates it lost between $40,000 and $70,000 in service charges because the
student distributed his computer program, which he called AOL4FREE, to hundreds of other
computer users.

<p><strong>Internet Deadbeats: </strong>Network Solutions Inc., the authorized collector of fees paid for Internet
addresses, reports that it's about $10 million short of the $20.7 million that should be in the
account, based on the number of addresses registered since payment was first mandated in 1995. 
The unpaid fees are partly attributable to "speculators and resellers who have no intention of
paying," says a spokesman for the National Science Foundation, the federal agency that appointed
Network Solutions Inc. and oversees its work.  Thirty percent of the money collected is
earmarked for the "preservation and enhancement" of the "intellectual infrastructure" of the
Internet, but so far, none of the funds have been spent.  "The sooner that the money is spent on
the good of the Internet, the better, in my opinion," says the president of the Internet Society. 
Meanwhile, a chemical engineering professor at Virginia Tech has called for a public accounting
of the $10.7-million shortfall:  "I think NSF has a tiger by the tail, and the prudent action is to let
go of the tail."

appointed by the Defense Science Board calls for spending $580 million in R&amp;D over the coming
years, mainly in the private sector, to develop new software and hardware to provide security,
such as a system for automatically tracing cracker attacks back to their source.  The task force
also recommends changing the laws so that the Pentagon can legally pursue and repel those who
attempt to hack into DoD computer systems, injecting their computers with "a polymorphic virus
that wipes out the system, takes it down for weeks."  A Defense Department spokesman notes
that the Advanced Research Projects Agency is working on an "electronic immune system" that
could detect invaders and mobilize against them.

about offenders who have "histories involving either pedophilia or hate crime activity, the illegal
use of explosives, those kinds of things...  We monitored the Internet to see just what type of

<title>Tips on Buying A Computer</title>
</head>
<body><BODY BGCOLOR="#DDD9A2"><b>
<h2>What to Look For When Buying A Computer</h2></b><br>
<h3>By Dave Ryan</h3>
<hr>
<p>

O.K., you're in the market for a new computer. If you're like many people out there, shopping for
a new computer may seem like you've entered an episode of Star Trek Voyager and landed on an
alien world. The jargon out there is full of confusing terms like RAM and ROM, megabytes and
megabits, hard disks and floppies, megahertz and turbo-chips, tape backups and zip drives, local
buses
and CD ROMS. It's enough to make you go out to the garage and dust off that old
typewriter.<p>

<p>

Yep, it's a loco-world out there--but not hopeless. Just a few hours of careful research will help
you
cut through the jargon and keep up with even the fastest-talking salespeople (who may not know
what they're selling either), allowing you to search for a system that fits your needs and budget.
To
help you get off to a good start, I've compiled a short seven-step buyer's guide. <p>

<p>

<b>1. What Do You Plan to Do With It Once You Get Home:</b> You wouldn't buy on of those
little
economy cars to cart the little league team around would you? Well the same goes for a
computer.
if you plan on working with spreadsheets, desktop publishing or multimedia programs that have
industrial strength requirements, then you need a system that can handle this type of memory
intensive
software. Even if you plan to do just word processing today, your needs are likely to change later.
Ask your friends and co-workers who bought a PC last year if their computer is still what they
need
today. I bet 7 out of 10 will say they need more of everything than they thought they would to run
today's programs.<p>

<p>

<b>2. Price:</b> Simple rule: If you want to keep the system for awhile, then buy as much system
as you can
afford today. This means staying away from the low-end bargains that may not be able to run next
year's software. Depending on your individual needs, this may mean a system with a big hard drive
or more memory or a 8x CD-Rom or a large monitor. If all you can afford right now is the
cheaper
system, take warning that it might run out of gas in two years and you'll have to spend again.  Of
course, the other school of thought out there might say that the PC makers are coming out with a
new processor every two-years or so and even if you buy top of the line it will be obsolete in two
years. There is some truth to this, but if you buy top of the line you do have a better chance of
surviving the next wave of the "fastest PC ever" to hit the market. Cheaper systems may not be
able
to run tomorrow's software.<p>

<p>

<b>3.  Processing Power:</b> Be careful when choosing your central processing unit (CPU). 
The CPU is
the brain of the whole operation. It determines how fast your computer processes information.
Since
new graphics and operating programs require lots of speed, most products today recommend a
Pentium processor-based system, the faster the better. Take heed that if your budget only lets you
purchase a low-end Pentium, or heaven forbid, an old 486, a great many can be upgraded to the
faster
processors. However, you need to be careful and make darn sure they make an upgrade for it.<p>

<p>

<b>4. Memory:</b> The key word here is Random Access Memory (RAM). This only sounds
scary.
Programs need enough RAM (which stores program temporarily) to run properly. Today's
computers 
generally come with at least eight megabytes (MB) of RAM. (A byte represents one character,
such
as a word; a megabyte is one million bytes). 8MB is O.K., but 16MB is better to take advantage
of
programs like Windows 95 and  multimedia (sound, video) features in many of today's programs.
Since memory prices have dropped considerably in recent months, it's a good time to load up on
memory. <p>

<p>

<b>5. Storage: </b>There are two types of storage drives, floppy and hard. Floppy drives actually
refer to
the (3.5" and 5.25") disk that software programs and information is stored on. Most PCS today
have
only one 3.5" floppy drives. The hard drive is the larger storage device inside your PC, used for
permanent storage of programs. Many of the new programs have large storage requirements, so
don't
get anything less than a 540 MB drive; a 1.2 gigabytes (GB) or more is better (1GB equals 1,000
MB).  I can remember only about 5-6 years ago when I bought a computer with an 80MB hard
drive.
I was the toast of my circle of friends who were sitting around with 20MB and 40MB drives.
These
days, I couldn't even run Windows 95 and a word processor with that 80MB hard drive. Get the
point - buy as much as you can - YOU WILL USE IT!!<p>

<p>

<b>6. Monitor: </b>The monitor is that TV looking thing with no knob for changing the
channels. At a bare
minimum look for 28 dot pitch (dp) or lower (less is better with dot pitch, which has to do with
the
space between the pixels and the resolution of what you see on the screen). Make sure it supports
Super VGA. Consider a larger (than 14-inch) screen if you do desktop publishing or graphics
work.
One big thing to remember is that unlike a TV, a monitor being sold as 13", 14" or 15", may not
actually have a viewing area of the stated inches. A new law requires that manufacturers disclose 
the
actual viewable area of a monitor so that consumers can see what they are buying. So, look for
actual
viewing area when buying and don't be impressed by spending big dollars on a 17" monitor that
may
only have the same viewable area of a high-end 15".<p>

  <p>

<b>7. Multimedia:</b> Many PCs today are "multimedia ready," with the CD-ROM and sound
board
pre-installed and speakers included in the package. The CD-ROM should be at least a quad-speed.
A double-spin type is getting sort of slow for today's software and I would try to avoid buying
anything with one installed in it. There are now six, eight, and even some ten and twelve speed
CD-ROM drives on the market now. If you can afford at least the eight, buy it.  The sound card
should
be 16-bit, and Sound Blaster compatible. I won't name names here, but try and avoid buying a PC
that has the speakers attached to the monitor. Why you ask? Well I don't claim to be Mr. Wizard,
but having large magnets like those found in speakers sitting attached to my monitor, which is
near
my hard drive (which is itself a magnetic medium), may be asking for trouble. I am sure there are
those out there who would disagree but I say better safe than sorry.<p>

<p>

So you now have my seven steps of things to look for when buying a PC. If you're more confused
than before you started reading this article, great. I've made you use some brain power today. I
suggest above all, do your homework. Read computer publications. You've already found this one
and you can find many other publications on the commercial online services, like America Online
and
also on the web. Other sources include your friends and neighbors. Ask them what they don't like
about their computer and avoid making the same mistake. Go down to the local school or
university
and stop in the computer department. Ask them what's hot and what to avoid. If you have kids,
ask
them. They might actually be more versed in what you need than anyone else. Search the papers
for
sales. Prices vary from store to store and you might find just what you are looking for in a Sunday
sale circular. Also take a look at some of the mailorder computer dealers, like Insight and CDW.
Many times they have nice system packages for a fair price. Good luck, I hope you find what you
need.<p>

<P>The packaging  for HoTMetaL PRO 3.0 states, "Why struggle creating
pages for the Web when you can use the easiest, most powerful Web
publishing tool". Well, as far as I'm concerned, they're right.
HoTMetaL PRO 3.0 has just about everything a budding or seasoned Web
author could want.   HoTMetaL PRO 3.0 features a WYSIWYG
(whatyouseeiswhatyouget) environment that lets aspiring authors
create and edit Web pages without HTML experience. </P>

<P>As a webmaster, I've spent numerous  hours creating web sites
(including the site for the magazine) with all sorts of Web authoring
tools including earlier versions of HoTMetaL Pro. Much time has been
spent struggling with clinky HTML editors and learnign cryptic codes
for frames, tables and forms. Finally, HoTMetal Pro 3.0 has been sent
down from the heavens in answer to my prayers; well actually it was
sent down from Canada by SoftQuad in response to my phone call, but
I'm sure you get the gist of the matter. This thing is both a wonder
and a time-saver. </P>

<P>Using a series of buttons, pull-down menus and customizable
toolbars, it lets you format text, create lists, insert a variety of
forms, choose your page's color schemes, and add images and page
links. The interface is fully drag-and-drop; create links or insert
text and image files by dragging them from an Explorer window. It was
really nice to be able to just drag a color I wanted for a background
from the list and poof, it was now the background with no editing or
writing code.  You can also import and automatically convert Word,
WordPerfect, AmiPro and RTF files to web  pages. </P>

<P>The program comes with a nice assortment of graphics and can
easily import your own as well.  You also get some sample Java
scripts, Shockwave files and audio and video files to spice up your
web pages.</P>

<P>One very nice feature is the ability to view your creation as a
preview in multiple web browsers. This way, you can see exactly what
folks with Netscape, Internet Explorer, Mosaic, etc will see.
Non-text items on a page are treated as individual elements, and you
can access their attributes with a right-click of your mouse.
Clicking on an inserted image, for example, lets you adjust a number
of HTML properties including height, width, border and alignment. 
</P>

<P>HoTMetaL's most notable feature is its Frame Editor. Once you've
created a new blank page, select the Convert to Frames option and
HoTMetaL automatically inserts all necessary coding, including
&lt;NOFRAMES&gt; tags for browsers that don't support frames. Open
the Frame Editor, and you're presented with an empty template page
surrounded by a yellow border. Simply drag and drop the border from
any side to create the size and number of frames you'd like. Then
click inside each frame and select its contents by typing in the URL
or file path in the included Source box. Finally, click on OK and
check out the page using the Preview option. </P>

<P>Creating tables is just as easy. The Insert Table feature lets you
select the number of rows and columns plus the border, alignment,
color, width and spacing of the table. HoTMetaL inserts a table into
your page and lets you edit specific cells by right-clicking on any
one and adjusting its respective HTML properties.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, while HoTMetaL's WYSIWYG interface does give you
the option of displaying primary HTML tags such as &lt;P&gt;,
&lt;TABLE&gt; and &lt;FORM&gt;, you can't edit or even view the
complete source code. But then, with this program you really don't
need to view that code anyway. If you're a CodeHead, I suggest you
view the pages after creating them with a text editor to get your
fix.</P>

<P>The program ships with an image-map and graphics editing tool,
MetalWorks. The program also lets you create and save your own
templates-helpful if you're trying to keep a multi-page site uniform.
There are also a number of Web page and frame templates and tutorial
files; including sample cgi scripts. </P>

<P>There is a spell checker, thesaurus and dictionary integrated into
the program to help you keep things correct on the pages you create.
These are word processing features usually not found in an html
authoring program.</P>

<P>The program supports Netscape, Microsoft Internet Explorer and
Java with registered users able to get free updates to the extensions
via Softquad's web site. </P>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#DDD9A2">
<b><h2>Mouse Tales: A column about the Macintosh</h2></b>
<h3>By George Herman</h3>
<hr>
<p>

<i>A Matter of Choice:</i> <p>

<p>

The idea of the Mac was to be friendly to the user who had no experience with computers. That
was the reason for the point-and-click, choose commands from a menu, way of working. An
effort was made to free the user from the technical jargon of other computers. Windows and
folders replaced directories, and files were called documents or applications. Of course, the Mac
quickly developed some jargon of its own. Icon was a Mac word used in a new way. One bit of
Mac language that has always amused me is "highlight." On a Macintosh, when an icon is
highlighted, it is darker colored than it was before. Anyplace else it would be shaded, but on the
Mac it is highlighted. In editing text, the highlighted text is white on black, or perhaps black on a
color you have chosen from the Color Control Panel. <p>

<p>

Text, folder, or icon, the highlighted item is said to have been selected. How can it get that way?
In a disk or folder window, you can point to an icon with the mouse and click once. With the
cursor between icons, you can hold the mouse button down and drag. A dotted selection
rectangle follows your dragging motion, selecting everything it touches. Or, as I pointed out a
while back, you can press one of the arrow keys, then use any or all of them to move the selection
from icon to icon until it is where you wanted it to be. All these methods work just as well when
the window is set to view as a list by name, date, or size. (In a list view, the behavior of the arrow
keys is more predictable than with icons - up or left arrow starts with the first item in the list,
down or right with the last.)<p>

<p>

In text editing, you can drag the cursor across the text you wish to select. Double clicking on a
word selects that word; triple clicking selects the whole paragraph in which it appears. Surprise -
you might have expected the triple click to select the line, but getting a whole line is too easy to
need a shortcut. Just drag from the end of the preceding line straight down to the end of the line
you want, usually a distance of less than a half-inch, and you highlight one line. If you want to
make a very long text selection, you do not have to drag over several pages. Click (and leave the
cursor) at the beginning of the text you want to select, then scroll to the end of the intended
selection, hold down the Shift key, and click again. Everything between the click and the
Shift-click will be highlighted. You can lengthen or shorten the selection by Shift-clicking where
you want the final selection to end. Oops! if you are like me, you may click at the new ending
before pressing the Shift key and then you'll have to start all over! <p>

<p>

In painting and drawing programs and in spreadsheets, dragging a selection rectangle works as it
does in a folder window. In the painting and drawing environment, the selection is usually not
highlighted; the dotted selection rectangle remains with its dots moving along the edge of the
rectangle to remind you that it is not part of the picture. People have named that rectangle with
the moving dots the marquee, after the moving lights which were once a common ornament of
theatre marquees. People with less romantic imagination call it the marching ants. <p>

<p>

So why do I go on and on about selection - what makes it worth the attention? If the user is freed
from having to remember commands, their spelling and their syntax by using point-and-click
menus he or she needs some way of telling the Mac on what object the command should operate.
In the Finder, if nothing is selected, the Open and Close commands are grayed out to show that
they are not available. Click on a folder, and the Open command turns black - and guess what it
will open.  <p>

<p>

In text, if nothing has been selected since beginning to edit, the Edit menu's Cut, Copy, Paste, and
Clear commands are all gray and unavailable. Select some text - a word or a few pages, it does
not matter - and Cut and Copy stand ready for use. After using either Cut or Copy, Paste is ready
to insert the Cut text (or a duplicate of the copied text) at the cursor. <p>

<p>

How can I speak so confidently of the procedures for text editing, no matter in what program
environment? Now we come to another of the friendly beauties of the Mac. These procedures for
selection, copying, and so forth, are not written by the programmer who produced your word
processor, data base, or whatever else you are typing in. They are built into the Macintosh
computer, literally, in a Read-Only Memory (ROM) chip. All a programmer needs to do is call on
them to do his/her dirty work. From the start, even before it was certain that anyone who did not
work for the Apple Corporation would write software for the Mac, Apple set programming
standards to be observed by every producer of Mac software. It has been said that the PC is a
computer but the Mac is a way of life. Dedicated Mac users simply won't buy software that does
not follow the standards. Text editing must work the way I have described, or we will not buy the
editor. If every program used different editing procedures, Mac users would have to read the
manuals, something which, unfortunately, many Mac users do with great reluctance. So true is
this, that most software publishers skimp on the manual and invest lots of time in preparing
on-screen help! As a consequence, the Macintosh and its software producers are responsible for
some of the best programming code and some of the worst printed text in the business! <p>

<p>

Every now and then, you may run across a piece of commercial software that does not play by the
rules. My wife is looking at a demonstration disk for a program to help weavers in the design of
fabric. It uses a selection rectangle, but it can't be drawn with the regular cursor. A crosshair
cursor has to be selected, then the rectangle drawn, and then the arrow cursor selected again so
that menu commands can be called on to work on the selection. It took some strong language and
a search of the online help to discover that. That kind of idiosyncrasy makes a Mac devotee
suspicious of everything else about the software. As we study the demonstration, I am constantly
expecting to find some other aberration. The author of the software could not have gotten away
with that if he had any significant competition, or were selling to a large Mac user population. For
a small, specialized audience, he seems to be able to stay in business - but if we find a competing
program that behaves as a Mac program should, we will prefer it!<p>

<b><h2>Useful Utility Software: Medicine for your PC or
Mac</h2></b><br>
<h3>By Robert Penny</h3>
<hr>
<p>

I've always thought that it's the little things in life that count the most. This saying stands true
for your PC as well. You can't operate your system if important  applications like your word
processor, data base, web browser or accounting package aren't up and running right? Here is
where the little things come in; your trusted software utility programs, working ever-faithfully in
the background of your PC to keep things up and running. Think about it, would you feel safe
downloading software off of the net without knowing that your antivirus program was at work?
Could you compress and decompress documents sent over electronic mail without a "zipping"
utility? Could you run those larger applications you need to crank-out the latest report if you
weren't using your RAM utility to eke out every last bit of available memory from your system? 
No, and that's why your utility software is so important.<p>

<p>

We all know that to keep our bodies healthy, you have to eat right, exercise regularly and see
your doctor from time to time. Your PC or Mac is no different: It also benefits from a bit of
preventive care and regular checkups. One of the most important steps you can take to keep your
computer in the pink is to stock its medicine cabinet with utility software. Not only will these
programs help you keep your computer fit, acting as both doctor and anti-body, but when
something does go wrong they can help you remedy the problem--fast and get you back to work 
as soon as possible.<p>

<p>

You may not realize it, but your computer already has some utilities, courtesy of its DOS,
Windows or Macintosh operating system. However, these built-in utilities usually have fewer
features than software sold separately and you may consider purchasing one or more of these
"specialist" programs to keep your system running in tip-top shape.<p>

<p>

Utility programs can work miracles on your computer; doing such things as undeleting a file,
diagnosing why you crash when using a certain application, formatting disks, compressing files,
toning up your system's RAM to squeeze out as much available memory as possible, and
defragging your hard drive. The best thing about these programs is you don't have to be a major
techhead to use them. In most cases, you simply select the utility function you want to run by
clicking on an icon, choosing an option from a pull-down menu or by typing instructions at the
DOS command line. Some utilities can be installed to sit in memory and pop up automatically
when a problem arises. Almost all of the programs reviewed came with extensive manuals, but
for the most part, installation and setup can be done just by installing the first disk and going from
there, with very little need to refer to the manuals.<p>

<p>

The utilities reviewed here include a full-range of helpful items to keep your system well and
worry free.<i> First Aid</i> and <i>Conflict Catcher</i> try to prevent some problems before
they happen.
<i>QEMM</i>,<i> RAM Doubler</i>, and <i>Speed Doubler</i> try to reclaim precious
memory. <i>Norton AntiVirus</i>,
<i>Symantec AntiVirus for Macintosh (SAM)</i>, and <i>McAfee VirusScan</i> search and
destroy debilitating
system viruses.<i> PKZIP</i>, <i>StuffIt Expander</i>, and <i>WinZip</i> are all excellent
choices for compressing
and decompressing files. <i>UnInstaller for Windows</i> lets you keep your PC tidy by
eradicating all
traces of a deleted program. <i>WinHacker 95</i> gives you the tools to get down and dirty
under the
hood of your Win 95 operating system and configure hidden options. <i>QuickTime Movie Player
for Windows</i> is a simple tool for playing QuickTime movies under Windows, and <i>Norton
Utilities
for Macintosh, Windows and Dos</i> provides an entire toolbox of fix-it applications. <p>

<p>

If you consider all the programs and files you install to, create on or delete from your hard drive
in the course of each day your hard disk takes more punishment than just about any other part of
your computer.. One of the most common hard-disk ailments is a loss of speed resulting from a
condition called "hard-disk fragmentation." What this term means is that data stored on your hard
drive is in pieces and not one continuous block of information. To explain this in plain language,
a hard disk stores data in blocks of space. Let's say you have a new hard disk that stores 20
kilobytes (KB) of data. If you save a document that uses 8 KB, the hard disk stores it in blocks
1 to 8; if you next save a 3-KB file, it goes to blocks 9 to 11. But then you decide to delete the
first 8-KB file and save a 12-KB document. There aren't enough contiguous blocks to save the
12-KB file in consecutive blocks. Instead, it saves part of the file in blocks 1 to 8 and the rest in
blocks 12 to 15. Over time, this "fragmentation" of data slows down your system and forces the
disk to store files in pieces and then when accessed, retrieve them from all of the nooks and
crannies it has tucked them away in. <p>

<p>

Fortunately there are a number of programs that can be used to defrag your drive. Both Dos and
Windows 95 come with a defrag utility. I liked the old Dos one, though it was limited, but do not
like the Windows 95 one at all. It takes a very long time to perform the same types of defrag that
used to take no time in Dos and it is sort of clunky to use. As an alternative, use the utilities found
on the <i>Norton Utilities</i>. <p>

<p>

O.K. here we go with the reviews.<p>

<p>

<b>System Enhancements:</b><p>

<p>

<i>First Aid 95 Deluxe for Win95 and Windows</i><p>

<p>

When a computer emergency arises, technical support can be expensive, and if after business
hours, darn frustrating. To handle emergencies when they happen, consider <i>First Aid 95
Deluxe</i>
from CyberMedia. If an application crashes or a multimedia device refuses to install, First Aid
prompts you to save your work and automatically fixes the problem.  The First Aid control panel
offers a variety of tools for fixing software, multimedia, or online connection problems. For
instance, the program automatically analyzes all of the software on your system so it can suggest
fixes for problems and even make the changes. <p>

<p>

<p>

First Aid's Crash Protector runs in the background and protects unsaved data before rebooting
in a system crash. One nice extra: First Aid ships with Windows 95 Update, an automated wizard
that locates the latest Win 95 device driver updates online (available at no cost from the Microsoft
Web site) and automatically installs them. This great option ensures that you're always running
the most up-to-date version of Win 95 programs. From CyberMedia, 310-581-4700,
800-721-7824; for $55-$60.<p>

<p>

<i>UnInstaller for Windows 95</i><p>

<p>

Only a few years ago, uninstalling an application meant just deleting all of its associated files in
a single directory. Today, you may need to clean up multiple directories and the many stray files
and INI command strings a program spreads throughout your system. I used the Windows 95
uninstall option to delete some programs I had installed but found it to be lacking quite a bit.
Although it said the programs were deleted, I found tons of files left over in various directories
that I had to delete manually. In an effort to find something more efficient, I turned to
<i>UnInstaller</i>
from MicroHelp; and I am glad I did.. <p>

<p>

UnInstaller knows how to find all of the scattered files associated with an application and remove
every last trace from your PC, even the application's icon. Just select the EXE file for the program
you want to delete and UnInstaller does the rest. It analyzes the program to be deleted and comes
back with its recommendation of all the files that need to be uninstalled. UnInstaller also lets you
look through these files to double-check that you concur with its recommended deletions. Files
color-coded with yellow may be shared with other programs, such as DLL files used by more than
one application. Files marked with red are most likely shared by another application as well. Once
you've looked these recommendations over, UnInstaller thoroughly removes the program and
generates a final report on what was deleted. Unlike the built-in Win95 uninstall option,
UnInstaller was easy to use and extremely thorough. Available from MicroHelp, 770-516-0899,
800-777-3322 for around $30 <p>

<p>

<i>Conflict Catcher 3 For The Macintosh</i><p>

<p>

Where do you turn when your system constantly crashes and freezes? Yes, it isn't only Windows
systems that are prone to the occasional crashes, Macs do it also.<i> Conflict Catcher</i> can be
a
lifesaver in this situation. This Mac utility focuses on helping you manage and analyze your
start-up files, a common cause of system ailments that can be difficult to diagnose. <p>

<p>

When your system freezes while saving a file, simply reboot and launch Conflict Catcher, which
runs a conflict test to identify what caused the freeze. Conflict Catcher initially scans for damage
in specific start-up files that you designate as possible culprits, or you can elect to scan all start-up
files. If Conflict Catcher hasn't determined the problem file after these initial tests, it performs its
own search for the problem. This is a time-consuming process that requires repeated restarting
of your Mac but will probably result in finding the culprit. <p>

<p>

If you like to know what your system is made of, Conflict Catcher provides a wealth of detailed
information on all the start-up files on your system and exactly what they do. But be warned: It
is not for the novice. The techno-babble is on a higher plain than most of us dwell and the
information may be more confusing than informative.. Conflict Catcher is available from Casady
&amp; Greene, 408-484-9228, 800-359-4920 for $99.95.<p>

<p>

<i>Norton Utilities for the Macintosh, Dos and Windows</i><p>

<p>

<i>Norton Utilities</i> from Symantec has long been the premier toolkit for tuning and repairing
PCS.
The latest versions, offer the same first-aid and preventive utilities as its predecessors, with some
nifty new graphics and animation clips. <p>

<p>

Disk Doctor, is a lifesaving utility that makes house calls day or night. Ever vigilant, it is on
standby to diagnose and repair damaged disks when you need it. The Disk Doctor performs
extensive analyses of your hard disk, checking for bad blocks (damaged areas on the surface of
your hard disk that can't safely store data), missing files, and other file and directory data. If the
Disk Doctor finds a problem, it recommends a solution that it'll perform at the click of a button.
As you wait for the completion of Disk Doctor's diagnostic tests (some require several minutes),
an animated doctor examines a spinning hard drive.<p>

<p>

UnErase is another critical lifesaver. When you blindly hit the Delete key and later realize your
fatal error in deleting the "Ferguson Account", UnErase resurrects the deleted file. UnErase scans
files that have been deleted from a hard or floppy disk and assesses the chances for recovery. If
your chances are good, click Recover to retrieve the deleted file. This is one utility you can't live
without. From Symantec, 1-800-441-7234. Mac version is $149 and the Dos and Windows
versions go for around $179. <p>

<p>

<i>WinHacker 95</i><p>

<p>

While Windows 95 does include some pretty useful "wizards" and system informational screens
accessed under system section of the Control Panel, it may not be enough. <i>WinHacker 95</i>,
a
shareware program, lets you configure hidden options in Windows that were made inaccessible
to avoid confusing most users. Microsoft probably made some of these options, such as the ability
to edit Win 95's register, inaccessible to avoid ruining your system's health.  <p>

<p>

Most of WinHacker's tools aren't dangerous; they're actually useful and even add some fun
touches. You can rename your recycle bin, place the contents of your control panel or dial-up
networking folders onto the start menu, and enable dual-boot keys for start-up (hitting the F4
key, for example, puts you into DOS). One great option lets you make the icon for a bitmap file
a miniature image of the bitmap itself. If you're game, WinHacker gives you the tools to get under
the hood and customize Win 95 to suit your personal needs. Download from
<a href="http://www.home.wojo.com/wedge">http://www.home.wojo.com/wedge</a>. A
registration fee of only $9.95 is suggested.<p>

<p>

<i>QuickTime Movie Player for Windows 95  and Windows 3x<p>

</i><p>

Viewing movies on your PC will never replace the big screen, but it can be much cheaper. You
can watch QuickTime movies on your monitor using the shareware program<i> QuickTime
Movie
Player for Windows.</i><p>

<p>

The QuickTime Movie format, created by Apple Computer and now licensed for both Windows
and Macs, lets you create animation sequences and digital video footage in a format that's been
compressed to run smoothly on a desktop computer. The QuickTime Movie Player makes it
possible to play back these QuickTime movies with a simple, reliable program.<p>

<p>

Installation takes seconds; just unzip the program and double-click on the Movie Player icon to
launch it. Then open a QuickTime MOV or an AVI file, and use the VCR-like controls (play,
forward, rewind, sound) to play it. You can also view statistics if you'd like more information
about the movie's video, audio, or file data. You can paste any frame from the movie onto the
clipboard for use in other programs. <p>

<p>

The QuickTime Movie Player can also make a handy helper application for playing QuickTime
movies downloaded from the Web. Costing a whole lot less than either a video player or a trip
to the movies for two, the QuickTime Movie Player brings movies to your PC. The program is
available for download from the web and the various online services.<p>

<p>

<b>SYSTEM OPTIMIZERS</b><p>

<p>

<i>QEMM for Windows </i><p>

<p>

If you want your applications to run faster, you could invest in more memory or you could just
buy a software memory maximizer. QEMM analyzes how your system is using memory under
both DOS and Windows (it works under both Win 95 and Windows 3.1), and it wrangles the
optimum system memory you have available. <p>

<p>

Upon installation, QEMM runs several test software routines to check for the best memory
configuration for your system. After Windows or DOS launches, QEMM automatically
configures your memory usage for the fastest, most efficient employment of your resources.<p>

<p>

I reviewed QEMM on a 33MHz 486 PC running Win 95 with 8MB of RAM, which is basically
a very underpowered configuration. After installation, QEMM was able to reclaim 56K of
conventional memory. However, there was no discernible improvement in speed. Both before and
after installing QEMM, I opened several applications and files that are slow to load (including a
communications application, Quarterdeck CleanSweep, and several large BMP files). None of
these programs or files loaded any faster with QEMM. So, what am I to make of this? Well, it
did give me more conventional memory, but perhaps at the cost of expanded or extended
memory. I can't say that QEMM is snake oil, but I will say that since every system's configuration
is unique, what you actually get may vary. It might very well male your system's available
memory speed up applications. Quarterdeck, 310-309-3700, 800-354-3222, <a href="http://
www.quarterdeck.com">http://
www.quarterdeck.com</a>; $69.95. <p>

<p>

<i>RAM Doubler and Speed Doubler For the Macintosh</i><p>

<p>

On the Macintosh platform, the best-selling software solution for increasing RAM is Connectix
<i>RAM Doubler</i>. Like QEMM, RAM Doubler increases your system's RAM by optimizing
your
memory and system resources. However, RAM Doubler is different from QEMM in one major
respect: It genuinely doubles your system's RAM, regardless of your system's configuration.<p>

<p>

Installing RAM Doubler couldn't be easier--it literally took under a minute. When I rebooted the
system and checked the amount of available RAM, we found that it had increased from 24.5MB
to 49.2MB. <p>

<p>

Again, while RAM was doubled there was little improvement in the speed of how fast it opened
such documents as DTP files with graphics, and how fast it performed such tasks as a virus scan
under Symantec AntiVirus for Macintosh. Despite the clear presence of twice as much available
RAM, none of these tasks performed at all faster, most took exactly the same amount of time as
before RAM Doubler was installed.. <p>

<p>

On the other hand, I got noticeable speed increases after installing another best-selling Connectix
program, <i>Speed Doubler</i>. Speed Doubler works by speeding up a variety of common
functions
on your system, such as maximizing disk caching (the process a system uses to read and write
data) and providing faster file copying and deleting.<p>

<p>

When I tried the same tasks using Speed Doubler that were tested under RAM Doubler, the
results were much better. The Disk Doctor checkup was a minute and 8 seconds faster than
without Speed Doubler. The virus scan went from 15 seconds to nine seconds, and the DTP files
took only half as long to load. <p>

<p>

RAM Doubler is probably most effective if you need to run software that requires more minimum
RAM than you have installed on your system. For instance, if a program requires a minimum of
12MB and you only have eight, RAM Doubler should push you over the edge. But for sheer raw
speed, Speed Doubler gets the job done. Connectix, 415-571-5100, 800-950-5880,
<a href="http://www.connectix.com">http://www.connectix.com</a>; RAM Doubler, $99;
Speed Doubler, $99 (list)<p>

<p>

<i>RAM Doubler for Windows</i><p>

<p>

<i>RAM Doubler for Windows</i> is a nice little piece of software that helps make your existing
RAM
work harder and better.  RAM Doubler doesn't really double your RAM. What is does is more
like caching or stacking your Ram and should have been called RAM Stacker or some more
appropriate name.<p>

<p>

What the program does is make more system resources available for the running of multiple
applications. Windows/DOS with the first 640k limitation on RAM, doesn't use your RAM
efficiently. With RAM Doubler on your PC, you'll get rid of the old familiar error messages such
as "insufficient memory" or "general protection fault" forever.<p>

<p>

I ran RAM Doubler for about two weeks prior to this article in an effort to check it out. I was
impressed with the way it managed my system resources. Many times I checked system resources,
through the use of a small entry added to the program manager "about Program Manager
section". When only one application was open there didn't seem to be much difference between
Ram Doubler and without Ram Doubler. It was the times when two or more application were
running, such as Word Perfect and CorelDraw, that RAM Doubler shined. The readings for
systems resources had drastic variation between with ands without RAM Doubler. In the example
above system resources without were down to 11% with Word Perfect and CorelDraw open.
With RAM Doubler resources shot back up to 45% - a very large, and when running Windows,
much needed difference in the allocation of system resources. <p>

<p>

System resources are top heavy. You need a 486 or better to run RAM Doubler (and just about
anything else these days), Windows 95 or 3x, and at least 8MB of RAM (4MB if using with
Windows 3x).<p>

<p>

<b>VIRUS DETECTORS</b><p>

<p>

<i>McAfee VirusScan for Windows 95 and Norton AntiVirus For Windows 95</i><p>

<p>

It's hard to understand what drives a nerdy, sociopathic techhead to invent a computer virus and
set it loose on unsuspecting users (O.K., I know some of you out there think the CIA and the
KGB make these things and you may be right; might even be the lab boys at the anti-virus
manufacturers so they can justify their own existence). But the motivation of some hacker in
Bugaria or Silicon Valley is the last thing on your mind when a virus strikes--you need help fast. 
<p>

The two leading virus utility programs on the Windows market, <i>McAfee VirusScan</i> and
<i>Norton
AntiVirus</i>, are both capable choices for preventing and curing virus outbreaks. Both run in the
background  checking for viruses, which if detected can be immediately removed. Both are
designed for Win 95, but McAfee includes a Windows 3.1 version (Norton makes a separate
AntiVirus for Windows 3.1).  <p>

<p>

McAfee VirusScan is the more basic of the two programs, resembling the Win 95 Find File applet
with the familiar tabbed file folder design. VirusScan scans your system to manually search for
viruses, providing minimal options on what to scan--program files only or all files. Once
VirusScan finds a virus, it gives you the option of scanning for other viruses, cleaning the infected
file immediately, or deleting the file altogether. VirusScan's VShield feature runs in the
background, alerting you instantly should it encounter a virus.<p>

<p>

Symantec, on the other hand, offers many different configuration options within Norton
AntiVirus. Although McAfee VirusScan can run in the background, Norton AntiVirus offers a
wide variety of options for how you'd like it to run in the background. For instance, Norton
AntiVirus lets you choose precisely what to scan on start-up. Unlike VirusScan, Symantec
includes a Scheduler so you can set up times for scans. (McAfee doesn't include backup
capabilities but suggests you use options found in Microsoft Plus to run scheduled virus
scans.)<p>

<p>

A good virus utility will have regular fixes of current viruses floating about and Symantec offers
a definite edge. Although both McAfee and Symantec sell disks of these updates for an additional
fee, Symantec offers these updates for free if you download them from CompuServe, AOL, or
the Internet. McAfee also lets you download a onetime, free 30-day update, but expects you to
pay the subscription fee if you continue to download the updates.<p>

<p>

Both VirusScan and Norton AntiVirus do an excellent job of preventing and removing viruses.
VirusScan offers both the advantage and disadvantage of simplicity, making it easy to use and
configure but lacking options. Norton AntiVirus offers more options and gives you more control.

<p>

<i>Symantec AntiVirus For Macintosh</i><p>

<p>

<i>Symantec AntiVirus</i> for Macintosh, otherwise known as SAM, offers all the same features
as
Norton AntiVirus for Windows 95 with a few extras. SAM is a bit more graphically enhanced
than Norton AntiVirus. Rather than using the tabbed file appearance of the Win 95 version, SAM
is much more icon driven with a layout full of information at a glance.<p>

<p>

SAM also offers a few small features that Norton AntiVirus doesn't. For instance, SAM gives you
a variety of options for handling floppies when inserted--including never scan, always scan, or
prohibit floppy insertion altogether. <p>

<p>

SAM also updates virus definitions from the Norton BBS directly through the program. Using
the Update Virus Definitions tool, the program automatically loads and dials the number and
transfers the files to the appropriate place on your hard drive. You can also schedule it to obtain
virus updates at designated times. <p>

<p>

Offering all the same benefits as its Windows cousin, with some genuinely useful extras, SAM is
an excellent choice for vigilant antivirus protection for the Macintosh market. Symantec,

<p>

<b>BOOT DISKS</b><p>

<p>

A great many times when your system crashes you might need to reboot it by using a floppy disk
rather than the operating system you have stored on your hard drive. This is especially true of
Windows 3x users. Windows 95 has a protected mode that reboots your system with minimal
operating functions until you can find out why the system crashed. I recommend that you always
keep a Windows boot disk near your PC for use during these times of crisis.<p>

<p>

<b>COMPRESSION TOOLS</b><p>

<p>

<i>PKZIP for Dos, and WinZip for Windows 95 and 3x</i><p>

<p>

In common computer usage, to "zip" a file is often synonymous with<i> PKZIP</i>, the
granddaddy of
all PC compression programs. PKZIP 2.04g, a DOS shareware program, is still the standard by
which all other compression programs are judged. If you're going to zip a file, make sure it's
compatible with PKZIP. <p>

<p>

At the heart of PKZIP is a compression algorithm that compacts data so it occupies less disk
space. Zipping and unzipping files with PKZIP is a breeze. At the DOS prompt, simply type the
command PKZIP followed by the name of the new zip file you'll be creating, then the name of the
file that you'd like zipped. For example: pkzip c:\compressed.zip c:\fullfile.txt.<p>

<p>

PKZIP lets you copy groups of files or all the files in a directory into a combined zip archive,
copy subdirectories intact, specify a sort order for how files are extracted from a compressed zip,
and create a single zip file on more than one floppy. Be prepared, however, to read the 115-page
manual. Although the DOS commands are simple, they're not as intuitive as using a Windows
point-and-click interface.<p>

<p>

PKZIP also includes PKUNZIP for opening those zipped files as well as some other useful
applications. Downloads of this popular file are available on all of the major online services, as
well as from many web sites throughout the internet.<p>

<p>

If point and click is what you're after,<i> WinZip</i> puts a friendly Windows interface on the
basic zip
functions, allowing you to perform some of PKZIP's more complex tasks through simple menu
and toolbar choices. Unzipping in WinZip involves choosing Open from the toolbar. If more than
one file has been combined in the zip archive, WinZip displays the files in the window. If you'd
like to unzip any of these individually (rather than decompressing the entire zipped archive),
double-click on the file of your choice.  <p>

<p>

WinZip also offers another great bonus: If you're unzipping compressed programs, such as
shareware that needs to be installed, WinZip will install the program and optionally delete the
entire install if you don't want to keep it. If you check out a lot of shareware, WinZip is a must.
<p>

<p>

Which zip program is better for your needs? If you just want a lightning fast, down-and-dirty
application to accomplish the zip basics, PKZIP is elegant simplicity itself. Alternatively, WinZip
offers an accessible Windows interface with some of the more complex zip commands. Using
either program, the process of zipping and unzipping data will become second nature. PKZIP
2.04G for DOS; PKWARE, 414-354-8699, fax: 414-354-8559, <a
href="http://www.pkware.com">http://www.pkware.com</a>; $47.
WinZip 6.0 for Windows; contact Nico Mak Computing Inc. at <a
href="mailto:sales@winzip.com">sales@winzip.com</a> or
<a href="http://www.winzip.com/winzip">http://www.winzip.com/winzip</a>; $29, free upgrade
<p>

<p>

<i>StuffIt Expander for Mac</i><p>

<p>

On the Mac side, the most popular compression program has a name that says it all: <i>StuffIt
Deluxe</i>. Like PKZIP, StuffIt employs a compression algorithm that shrinks your files to a
smaller
size. The StuffIt Expander, one of the top five shareware downloads, is the part of the program
that unzips compressed files. Opening a compressed file using the Expander is a easy process, just
drag and drop the file onto the Expander icon, and a dialog box informs you of its progress as it
quickly expands the file and returns it to full size. <p>

<p>

Expander can open many kinds of compressed files beyond its native StuffIt (SIT) format,
including Compact Pro, BinHex, and MacBinary on the Mac side, and ZIP and ARC files on the
PC side.  <p>

<p>

StuffIt Expander is in a special category of shareware called freeware, which is just like it sounds:
no-cost software. If you would like to purchase the part of the program that actually does the
compression, you'll need to buy StuffIt Deluxe for $59.95 (which also includes Expander). StuffIt
Expander is one of those nice little bonuses in life--free and completely intuitive to use, so enjoy.

Travelers in Touch</FONT></B></P><br>
<P><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#AF0000">By Craig Crossman</FONT></P>

<P><HR></P>

<P>QUESTION:</P>

<P>My job requires lots of travel, so I mostly use a Pentium-based
notebook computer. I used to need it primarily for database and word
processing, but I find that connectivity is becoming the most
important thing. Checking e-mail, Internet access, sending faxes and
even remote networking with the office computer keep me tied to a
phone line. What wireless options are available?</P>

<P>ANSWER:</P>

<P>NovaLink Technologies has recently introduced an all-in-one
communications product, the GoAnyWhere Modem.  This Type II PCMCIA
card, which is the size of a credit card, has been extended about two
inches in length to accommodate its additional capabilities, which
are impressive. </P>

<P>GoAnyWhere combines a 14.4 fax/modem, a cellular modem and a
wireless network adapter. That lets you stay in touch from virtually
any location, while eliminating the need to lug around components. 
</P>

<P>When you need to surf the Web or check the e-mail, you have three
ways to make the connection: When a phone is handy, the conventional
14.4 fax/modem works just like what you have now. </P>

<P>To send over the air, the card's wireless network adapter utilizes
the RAM Mobile Data Service, which provides access to over 90 percent
of the U.S. urban business population. The card sports one of those
two-inch rubber antennas. </P>

<P>If you happen to be in an unserviced area, you can still get
through by using GoAnyWhere's cellular modem with your cellular
phone. The card attaches to your cellular phone via a special cable. 
</P>

<P>After accessing your wireless service, GoAnyWhere requires no
special software and works with your existing communications
programs. Run your web browser or fax software as you would with any
other wired modem.</P>

<P>The GoAnyWhere Modem has its own rechargeable lithium battery,
which gives up to eight hours of wireless operation without draining
your portable's batteries. An indicator light on the card alerts you
when the battery is low. You can also use your portable's battery
power.</P>

<P>NovaLink also offers a wireless messaging service that's designed
to work with GoAnyWhere and lets you group your messages by type,
such as fax, voice, data and alpha/numeric page. Check with NovaLink
for details. The GoAnyWhere Modem ($529) is available from: NovaLink
Technologies (800) 668-2546 or (510) 249-9777</P>

<P>QUESTION:</P>

<P>I need a good back-up program for the Macintosh, something with
lots of flexibility. What exactly is an incremental backup? </P>

<P>ANSWER:</P>

<P>A program that can back up incrementally can back up only what you
added or altered since the last time you backed up. Nothing else is
copied.  This can save you hours, since you would otherwise have to
copy the entire disk each time.</P>

<P>One of the most powerful and flexible back-up products for the Mac
is actually three products. Dantz offers three versions of its backup
software: DiskFit Direct ($49.95), DiskFit Pro ($125) and Retrospect
3.0 ($249) are, respectively, Dantz's lite, regular and
extra-strength solutions.</P>

<P>Direct offers a "one-button" solution. Press it and you are
assured your data are secure.  Want more control? Pro offers
additional features that organize the back-up in Finder format and
place all files and folders in the exact same position as on the
original.  Retrospect does it all. You can automatically keep or
delete backed-up files you have removed from the original and write
intricate scripts that act as a program to back up only what is
needed. Dantz Development (800) 982-9980 or (510) 253-3000 </P>

<b><h2>Love on the Internet: Looking for Love in all the
Right Places</h2></b>
<h3>By Martin P. Waterman</h3>
<hr>
<p>

                                                                 <p>

Perhaps the real story of the Internet is the fact that it is much more of a social phenomenon
than it is a technological revolution.  The Net continues to enhance and change lives by
bringing people with common interests closer together as well as making the task of finding
information and products much easier.  However, one of the unanticipated consequences of
the Internet is that it has also resulted for many new relationships from simple friendships to
long term relationships and often marriage.  Of course, the Internet in being such a powerful
medium in bringing people together, has also resulted in a great deal of well publicized
divorces as well.<p>

<p>

Recently, there has been much written and published about Internet romance as online
romances flourish and become more commonplace.  Meeting someone online has completely
different dynamics than meeting someone in person with the former proving itself to be a
much more potent medium to use than trying to meet potential mates than by using the
traditional methods.  <p>

     <p>

A hundred years ago, or so, it was common for many men, especially if they were rural-based
to order a mail order bride often coming from far away lands. Today, finding that special
person, for both genders, continues to be a difficult proposition especially if you are far from
major urban centers and population areas or you are tired of the club scene and loath the
thought of going to single's functions or using a dating service.   <p>

<p>

The Internet provides a simple and effective alternative and since it is responsible for making
the entire world a much tighter knit global community, meeting potential mates in a casual yet
effective manner is very possible, so much so that a large percentage of the unions stemming
from Internet meetings were not even planned.<p>

<p>

<b>Internet Love Dynamics</b><p>

<p>

There are probably two principal reasons that explain why Internet romances are occurring
with such a great frequency.  As human beings we are very diverse creatures.  Normally, we
tend to date and marry people from our immediate environment such as our neighbourhood,
workplace, church, etc.  If that special person for you is one in a million or one in a thousand,
(One in a hundred or less if you are not picky) it is unlikely that you may meet them in your
immediate area.  By using singles groups on the Internet and on the WWW, you can expose
yourself to potentially hundreds of thousands (or more) of members of the opposite sex which
gets the laws of averages working in your favour to find that special person.<p>

<p>

 Another reason the Internet is such a potent match maker is that it is a still a somewhat blind
medium.  In the real world, when you meet someone in person, you are prejudiced by many
factors such as your own idea of what an ideal mate should look like and a number of other
factors based on your past experiences, morals, values, even the television shows you watch.  
Meeting someone over the Internet, on the other hand, forces you to get to know a person
first without arbitrarily dismissing them because they are too tall, too short or perhaps bear
too close resemblance to some past partner in your past for which you may have not had a
good experience.  In other words, you are less likely to throw away a person who might be
the ideal mate on a decision that judges them primarily on physical appearances and other
aspects which alone could do little to guaranty the success, intensity or longevity of any union.
Furthermore, in getting to know them on the Internet, the bonding process has already started
long before you meet or even see the other person.  Since you don't have to worry about your
appearance or mannerisms in front of the computer, you can free to be yourself. How many
times, in the real world, have you wanted to approach someone only to be too shy or fear
rejection and then be left to wonder "what if" for the rest of your life.  Fear of rejection and
embarrassment is not usually a concern in cyberspace since most people are quite relaxed and
more likely to be their true selves when using their computer to communicate with others.<p>

     <p>

<b>How and How-Not-To find a Cybermate</b><p>

<p>

More and more and more people are getting their own WWW sites and posting their photos
on the Internet.  This is one way but not the best way to start to let potential mates find you
on the Internet.  However, if you do have your own URL, this can be used once you have a
rapport with someone or used in conjunction with an ad in the USENet news groups and the
WWW.<p>

     <p>

Of course, people are always meeting because of common interests, because they participate
in mailing lists or meet in chat groups.  However, if you really want to use the full power of
the Internet in your favour, you have two potent options; singles news groups &amp; single sites
on the WWW. <p>

<p>

<b>Singles News groups</b><p>

<p>

There are dozens and dozens of news groups that cater to singles on the Internet.  However,
most of them are unmoderated and are frequented by those who are marketing 900 numbers
and other stuff, usually of the x-rated genre. However, some of the news groups are still an
excellent place to advertise because of the high volume of people who read the ads.<p>

     <p>

There are all kinds of single news groups reflecting different focuses. Two of the most popular
are alt.personals and alt.personal.ads.  There are also other more specific groups such as
alt.personals.tall and regional groups such as chi.personals (Chicago area).  If you live in a
large metropolitan area this may be a good chance that a regional single group may exist.<p>

     <p>

<b>Single Sites on the WWW</b><p>

     <p>

Single sites on WWW represent some of the best and easiest ways to find a mate.  If you do a
WWW search using the words or the word "Cupid", or go to<a href="
http://www.cupidnet.com"> http://www.cupidnet.com</a> you
will find links to the most important single sites on the World Wide Web.  Although you can
find the modern equivalent of mail-order brides from Russia, South America and the South
Pacific, the two biggest and most popular groups are American Singles and WebPersonals.
While the majority of ads are from North America, both are have people from around the
world placing ads, and of course anyone on the planet with WWW access can answer your ad
as well.<p>

     <p>

Placing an ad on American Singles or Web Personals is quick and painless. You simply fill out
a form and specify such things as if you are looking for a Pen Pal, Just a Friend and Maybe
More, A Committed Relationship possibly leading to Marriage, Marriage as well as other
options.  Some of the sites allow you to search a data-base using key words.  For instance,
under activities or hobbies you can immediately find all those who share similar interests as
yourself.<p>

<p>

Another popular WWW singles site is WebPersonals.  These sites are very potent and many
internet matches have been made many of which lead to marriage.  Many of the sites have a
collection of "happy endings" available.<p>

<p>

<b>Writing an Internet ad</b><p>

<p>

Writing an ad is not difficult.  The first consideration is to be honest. If you are not, it will
eventually catch up with you.  The second thing is to take some time to consider two very
important things; what you have to offer and what you want.  This is important because many
people go through life never giving these two things a second thought.  One way to remedy
this is to take some time studying other people's ads which will usually spark some ideas.<p>

<p>

One of the most common mistakes is when people go overboard on the "wants".For instance,
if you say you are looking for a  person who is blonde, with blue eyes, a preferred height and
other qualities, the more you say, the more potential respondents you eliminate thus reducing
your chances of finding that special someone.  Furthermore, many women find it objectionable
when men list physical requirements so that even if she does measure up, she may never
respond.<p>

<p>

Unlike a newspaper ad, the Internet allows you more words to work with. A good thing to
mention is your dreams, ambitions, hobbies and personality traits.  Simple things such as
whether you like to cook, like pets or have a sense of humour are important as they can be the
initial spark to get a reply or start a conversation that leads to something special.<p>

     <p>

If you are particularly nervous about writing your ad, there is two very simple solutions.  First,
have someone else, a friend perhaps who is objective, write the ad for you.  Second, and
probably best, read the Internet ads and see which ones has phrases or qualities you feel
describe yourself.  Borrow these to help you build your own ad. <p>

<p>

Another very important piece of advice is that it is far better to place an ad than to reply to
one.  A good ad may bring in hundreds of replies. Therefore, if you reply, you may be just one
of the crowd.  If you place the ad, you get to pick and choose.<p>

     <p>

Getting someone to answer you ad is usually not the difficult part. Checking your e-mail can
become a very exciting proposition as you never know when there may be a response. Once
you are communicating with people the challenge becomes to find out how compatible those
who respond are with yourself.  The trick is to have fun, be yourself and do not be in too
much of a rush.  Hey, its not like brain surgery and mistakes are not fatal!<p>

     <p>

Many of the sites offer you the chance to use anonymity so that no one need know who or
where you are until such time as you wish to make that information available.  This is
comforting for many people since the Internet is but a reflection of the real world meaning
that there are some pretty strange characters out there.<p>

     <p>

Many women like meeting men over the Internet because they are likely to be judged on their
personalities and minds rather than their physical attributes.  Many men like meeting women
on the Internet because they know that the women will not be attracted to them because of
such things as their wealth or their own imperfections.  Of course, these things can apply to
both sexes but the point is that the Internet, as long as you allow it to, forces a meeting of the
minds and personalities which is almost impossible to do in real life.  It also allows courtship
and flirting to be done by those who do not have the disposable time (and income) to pursue
conventional dating methods.<p>

     <p>

If you are a man and really serious about finding a companion, an excellent book on the
subject is A Man's Guide to Advertising for a Woman by Sebastian Phillips (Loompanics:
ISBN 1-55950-146-4).  It can be ordered by calling 1-800-380-2230 and is an inexpensive
investment for $ 16.95 when you consider the book has so much useful information that may
help you find that mate for life.  According to the author "Most men give greater thought to
purchasing a power tool or a used vehicle than they do in finding a person who could be their
mate for life"  In the short time the book has been out it has already been responsible for many
unions.  It is my understanding that the publisher is considering a similar book for women but
published the book for men first since men have the most difficulty writing ads that can solicit
the large volume of replies that women's ads seem to do almost automatically.  Of course, the
challenge for women is to qualify and sort through all the replies to make sure they are getting
what they are seeking.<p>

     <p>

One of the great things about the WWW single sites is the fact that they also have information
on placing and replying to ads.  Using this information and a site that suits your style, you can
quickly place an effective ad and be meeting potential mates in the comfort of your own home
or wherever you have your computer.  With e-mail, you can carefully consider your replies
(unlike a personal encounter) and correspondence and unlike snail mail, the interchange can
speed to quite a fervent pace if the chemistry is there.  <p>

<p>

Internet dating can be fun and at the very least you may end up with many new friends.  You
may also find that very special person that you often wondered if they existed. In fact, most
people who rad the Internet single's ads never plan on answering an ad.  However, often they
read one that has an impact on them and they fire off a reply and this is how many
relationships have started. <p>

<p>

Phillips, in his book asked a number of people who had used the Internet to find a mate if they
would use it again.  Almost all said they would giving testament that it is a simpler, less
intimidating and more effective way to find yourself a significant other.  If none of the
respondents are what you need, it is easy enough to place another ad and get another bunch to
evaluate. <p>

<b><h2>Quarterdeck Unleashes New Tools For Windows 95</h2></b>
<h3>By Ted Brockwood</h3>
<hr>
<p>

Quarterdeck is fast becoming a software juggernaut. First they gave us Qemm, then Qemm 7.5,
then Cleansweep. Then they jumped into the internet feet first with Webserver and the popular
Quarterdeck Internet Suite. Now they've struck gold again with a trio Windows 95 compatible
applications designed to make systems run better, faster, and more robust than ever before.
Unleashed upon the 32 bit (and 16 bit) world is Cleansweep 95, MagnaRam 2, and Winprobe 4.
All are designed with Windows 95 users in mind, especially those users with limited system
resources (and limited cash flow!)<p>

<p>

<i>Cleansweep 95</i><p>

<p>

Quarterdeck's Cleansweep for Windows was a great application, and the Windows 95 version is a
serious upgrade filled with options and abilities. Cleansweep 95 allows for simple disk cleanup of
old files and more extensive archiving and uninstalling options.<p>

<p>

I really liked the original Cleansweep for the fact that it was compact (around 2 megs of disk
space) and it could recover many times that amount of lost space from your hard drive. The first
time I used it (under Windows for Workgroups) I recovered 20 megs of wasted space from my
drive. So Cleansweep 95 had some high expectations to live up to. And it didn't let me down.<p>

<p>

Cleansweep 95 scours your hard drive finding temp files, old backups, unused images, and
anything else that's wasting space. When deleting files, you can choose the safer options of
archiving (compressing) the file, or you can delete it. For the truly worry-prone, you can save a
log of all the deletions/archive operations/uninstalls performed.<p>

<p>

Speaking of uninstalls, that's another great component of Cleansweep 95. If you haven't noticed
yet, not all Windows 95 programs come with an uninstall utility. So if you install something you
wind up becoming less-than-enthused about, you may not be able to uninstall it from the Control
Panel's "Add/Remove Programs" applet. Cleansweep 95 can be set to log each and every new file
installation thus allowing you to fully remove a file and delete all changes it has made to the
registry when you need to uninstall it.<p>

<p>

Another optional feature is the System usage monitor. This monitor tracks file usage and
recommends files for deletion or archiving if they are rarely used. The usage monitor can be
customized to your preferences, allowing you to decide when a file should be considered
"unused".<p>

<p>

For those sticking with Windows 3.1 or 3.11, you're not left out. If you buy Cleansweep 95, it
comes with a free copy of Cleansweep for Windows and a coupon for free upgrades of the basic
Cleansweep for Windows (3.1/3.11) software. <p>

<p>

Cleansweep 95 is a must have for anyone with limited disk space and those who like to keep their
system tidy.<p>

<p>

System Requirements:  Intel-based PC running Windows 3.1x, or Windows 95, 5 MB Hard Disk
space<p>

<p>

<i>MagnaRAM2 (for both Windows 3.1x and Windows 95)</i><p>

<p>

Need more speed and power for your system? Can't afford to shell out money for RAM chips?
Don't bother! Grab a copy of MagnaRAM 2 and you'll be on your way to high powered Windows
operations without the high cost and complications of RAM chips.<p>

<p>

MagnaRAM uses an proprietary memory compression technique to provide up to 3 times more
available Windows memory to your system. The software takes information that is currently in
RAM and compacts it, allowing more new info to be placed into RAM.<p>

<p>

MagnaRAM is configurable to your preferences, be they speed or power. If you like to work
quickly, you can create smaller storage buffers, if you like the power of running multiple
applications, then you can increase the buffers.  A graphical display tells the story of your memory
and how it is being allocated. The graphs are not  that easy to understand, but basically all you<p>

need to know is that the compression is working. <p>

<p>

The compression does work. I tested it by opening as many MS-DOS prompts as possible under
Windows 95. I gave up at around 30, it was still going and never once complained about low
memory. (As I write this, I have  WordPerfect 6.0, Windows Explorer, Amipro 3.1, Aldus
Photostyler, 2 MS-DOS Prompts, Windows Paint,  and HoTMetaL Pro running with no resource
problems) I'm running on only 8 MB RAM, so to be running this many apps the compression had
better be working!<p>

<p>

MagnaRAM 2 is another outstanding product from Quarterdeck, and at only $39.95 it beats
buying more RAM chips! <p>

<p>

System Requirements: 386 or higher PC running Windows 3.1x or higher, 4 MB RAM, and 2
Megabytes of Hard Disk space.<p>

<p>

<b>Winprobe 4:</b><p>

<p>

Last but certainly not least comes Winprobe 4, the troubleshooting toolbox for Windows users. If
you've got problems with your Windows configuration, Winprobe may be just what you need. It
features a digital control panel with tachometer style gauges of system performance, an ini editor
(for Windows 3.1x users), a registry editor (for Windows 95) and a variety of system and memory
optimization tools.<p>

<p>

The best tool is the memory optimizer. Simply click the optimize button and your system
resources are optimized "on the fly" for peak performance.<p>

<p>

In the same package as Winprobe 4 you get CD Certify Pro (for CD optimization and 
trouble-shooting), Quarterdeck Mosaic (an OK web browser), and Cleansweep for Windows
3.1x.  A great package of products for the suggested retail of $49.95.<p>

<p>

System Requirements: An Intel based PC running Windows 3.1x, or Windows 95, 2 MB of Hard
Disk space.<p>

<p>

Quarterdeck seems to be pushing cross platform products as is evident by the ability to use all
these applications on Windows and Windows 95. With these three applications Quarterdeck has
scored a major coup in the high performance, low cost area of software design. If these three
products are any indication of what's in store for the future from Quarterdeck, we could see this
company emerging as the dominant player in the field of system and memory management.<p>

<title>Mac Spell Checkers</title>
</head>
<body><BODY BGCOLOR="#DDD9A2">
<b>
<h2>Mac Spell Checkers</h2></b>
<h3>By Tif Bailey</h3>
<hr>
<p>

Nearly every word processing program has a means of proofing a document for correct word
spelling. Not just the big words but the little ones with transposed letters or a missed capitol.
However, some applications such as e-mail, newsreaders, browsers. or spreadsheets do not have
built-in spell checkers. What to do? Get a spell checker that works across any application. On the
MAC side two are currently available. One is Spelling Coach Professional by Deneba Software
and the other is Spell Catcher by Casady &amp; Greene. Both have a catalog price of under
$50.<p>

<p>

My favorite is Spell Catcher as it continues as user friendly as Thunder 7 from which it evolved.
In addition to checking words, it offers a full featured thesaurus and glossary expansion to any
MAC application. Spell Catcher is a control panel which uses a folder in the system folder. After
opening the control panel applications are selected to include Spell Catcher. Once the application
is up an running an exclamation mark is displayed in the menu line. Clicking and holding on this
mark brings down the menu for Spell Catcher. Checking words and other errors can be done
interactively while typing or by in batches by selecting blocks of text. The preferences dialogue
box or the control panel itself can be opened from the menu line. The preferences guiding Spell
Catcher can either be specific to the application or universal across all applications. Either the
curser or key strokes can be used to perform all functions.<p>

<p>

Installation is strait forward, start up with extensions off (hold down shift key till a message is
displayed) and turn off virus protection. Insert the first of two disks and click on install. Spell
Catcher gives a choice of installing a large or small dictionary and companion thesaurus
depending on hard drive space. The program will become inactive after 14 days unless the serial
number is entered at the first activation. An eighty page manual clearly explains all the features
and is even bound with a wire ring so it will stay flat on the desk.<p>

<p>

Full installation includes three additional main dictionaries (containing approximately 20,000
words apiece) and one supplemental dictionary. The main dictionaries included are a Medical
Dictionary, a Legal Dictionary, and an Engineering/Scientific Dictionary; and a supplemental
HTML Dictionary. It comes with a utility to make an individual dictionary. Such a file might
include names from a membership list. New words can also be added to main dictionary while
spell checking. However adding names to a regular dictionary can cause regular words to be
misspelled. For example I occasionally use the letters Tif as a nickname. If I add Tif to the
dictionary and I type tif when I mean tiff or TIFF Spell Catcher will change my nickname to
Tagged Image File Format.<p>

<p>

In addition a collection of sound files is provided for use as interactive signals. They can used in
Spell Catcher, or any other program that uses sounds by moving them to the system folder. The
desk bell sound is especially nice.<p>

<p>

With Interactive Checking turned on Spell Catcher checks the letters after the last space to the
previous space and beeps if an error is detected. I find this distracting from getting the sentence
finished. The beep can be ignored as Spell Catcher doesn't automatically dominate the screen.
Spell Catcher can be brought up after the beep with a preset key stroke for a suggestion to
replace the suspect word. I prefer checking the paragraph or document after the content is
finished.<p>

<p>

The glossary function can be useful to change abbreviations to full words especially in spread
sheets or databases that don't feature pre-choices in data entry lines. The glossary function can
also correct type-os on the fly and enter the current day &amp; date by typing ddd.<p>

<p>

Some of the other tools are grouped as Modify Selected Modify selected paragraph for instance,
will take multi-line text on the clipboard and remove the extra return characters to produce
complete paragraphs of text. Handy when collecting text from bulletin boards on some web
sources. The Ghostwriter feature will log every key stroke. In the event of a power failure a
document can be recovered. It won't be pretty but it will all be there.<p>

<p>

Casady &amp; Greene has done a good job of keeping all the functionality of an application from
the
early MAC days and making it compatible with System 7+ plus adding additional features.<p>

<title>Mouse Tips</title>

<b><h2>Keeping Your Mouse Clean Is Important</h2></b>
<h3>By Bill Franklin</h3>
<hr>
<p>

Here's a nice little tip on keeping your mouse functioning properly. When your mouse gets dirty it
can make it hard to control the pointer on the screen. If your mouse does start giving you
problems;
such things as jittery or jumpy movement, try cleaning it before buying a new one. <p>All you
have to
do is turn the mouse upside down, turn the panel in the direction the arrows point, turn the mouse
upside down, and the ball falls out. Use a dry cotton swap to clean any dirt out from around the
edges. Make sure you take care to do it gently. If the ball is dirty or sticky, clean it with some
water
and dry it completely, and then put it back it. Slide the panel back in place and you before you
know
it, your mouse is ready for action again.  <p>

<title>Net Searching</title>
</head>
<body><BODY BGCOLOR="#DDD9A2">
<b><h2>FINDING SOMEONE ON THE NET</h2></b>
<hr>
<p>

You can search for individuals on the Internet with a variety of tools. However, the process can
be time-consuming, frustrating, and costly especially if you don't have much information to start.
As a result, I recommend that you obtain as much information as possible about the people youre
trying to find before you attempt to locate them on the Internet.The most cost-effective Internet
search method is a Usenet inquiry or search; it can be performed by users who only have e-mail
capability. This method will suffice, even if a name is all you have. Keep in mind that Usenet
inquiries look for people who have recently accessed the Usenet, so an occasional user may not
show up in your search.Start by sending an e-mail message to mail-server at either of the
following Usenet servers:<p>

<pre><a href="mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu">mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu</a>
<a href="mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu">mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu</a>
</pre>
Dont bother placing anything in the subject line of your message, because the server will ignore it.
In the body of the message, type send usenet-addresses / john doe. A space must separate the john
and doe keys; in fact, a space must separate any additional information keys (used to narrow a
search), such as city and state (for example, send usenet-addresses / john doe pensacola). You can
perform multiple Usenet inquiries with the same e-mail message by adding additional send
usenet-addresses lines.<p>

<p>

Less-specific inquiries may give you more information than you want. If your inquiries fail to
produce the desired results, consider sending an e-mail message for help to

<b><h2>Apple News</h2></b>
<hr>
<p>

Apple recently made available its first system software update since announcing in August that its
much delayed next-generation OS, Copland, would be released in a piecemeal fashion. <p>

<p>

System 7.5.5 includes all of the improvements found in the System 7.5.3 Revision 2 update that
was released in June, as well as a number of other reliability improvements. To help ease
confusion, Apple has adhered to its revised system software nomenclature--changes in the first
number reflect major architectural changes, changes in the second digit reflect significant
additions to the OS, and the third digit reflect incremental updates. <p>

<p>

According to Apple, performance and reliability enhancements include:<p>

<p>

 --a revised virtual memory manager that speeds application launches; <p>

<p>

--a revised Code Fragment Manager that helps some large, PowerPC-native applications launch
faster and enables some applications to launch in low memory situations; <p>

<p>

--a reduction of "Type 11" errors on PowerPC systems, typically seen in low memory
conditions;<p>

 <p>

 --improved floppy formatting and reliability, and resolution of some compatibility issues involving
the 5400 and 6400 series of Macs. <p>

<title>Lexis PTRAK Alert</title>
</head>
<body>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#DDD9A2">

<h2><b>Lexis Ptrak Knows More about You
Than You Might Think</h2></b><br>
<h3>By Mr. X<p></h3>

<hr>
<p>

I'm sure you've all heard of the recent "scandal/problem" involving LEXIS and the availability of
much of your personal information to those subscribing to their database. LEXIS officials say that
the data is safe and only open to subscribers, which include lawyers, government agencies etc.
However, presumably anyone wanting to pay their subscriber fees can get the data, YOUR
DATA!  Here's a little background on the situation and something that you as the consumer can
do about it. <p>


<b>THE PROBLEM:</b> <p>

It is alleged that your name, social security number, current address, previous addresses, mother's
maiden name, birth date, telephone number and other personal information are now available to
anyone with a credit card through a new Lexis database called PTRAK.  As I am sure you are
aware, this information could be used to commit credit card fraud or otherwise allow someone
else to use your identity.<p>


<b>THE SOLUTION:</b><p>

You can have your name and information removed from this list by faxing your full name and
address to (513) 865-1930 or sending physical mail to Attention PTRAK / P.O. Box 933 /
Dayton, Ohio 45401.  If you'd like further information call (800) 543-6862, select option 4 and
then option 3 ("all other questions").<p>


<b>INFORMATION</b>: <p>

As word of the existence of this database has spread on the net, LEXIS-NEXIS has been
inundated with calls, and has set up a special set of operators to handle the volume.  In addition,
Andrew Bleh (rhymes with "Play") is a manager responsible for this product, and is the person to
whom complaints about the service could be directed.  He can be reached at the above 800
number.  Ask for extension 3385.  According to Lexis, the manager responsible is Bill Fister at
extension 1364.<p>


<b>LEXIS-NEXIS DISCLAIMER:</b><p>

Representatives at LEXIS-NEXIS claim that the  PTRAK database is marketed to the legal
community for use by attorneys, law enforcement agencies and police departments in order to
conduct research on court cases in areas like child support and missing persons.  They claim that
PTRAK is a business-to-business service and not a consumer online service.  They claim that the
database may, but not always include an individual's address, maiden name and assumed names,
current address, up to 2 previous addresses, month and year of birth, and telephone number. 
They claim that the database does not include credit history, bank account information, personal
financial data, or medical history.  All information comes from a credit bureau.<p>


Seems to me that these people at LEXIS-NEXIS make enough claims of things not being in their
database, that they could be the PR agency for the CIA or work on the O.J. Simpson defense
team. Just two of many groups that would also have access to your data in PTRACK if they
subscribed to it.<p>

<b>SUGGESTION</b>: <p>

Call me paranoid, but I for one don't like my personal information open to every nosey lawyer,
government official or anyone else. I suggest that you all inundate these people with requests to
remove your information from the list and forward this articled to everyone you know to do the
same thing.<p>

<P>Even with the bevy of information Windows 95's control panel can
offer you, gathering system information can sometimes feel like
looking for a needle in a haystack. TouchStone's CheckIt Diagnostic
Kit can help keep your needles separated from those pesky haystacks.
</P>

<P>CheckIt includes CheckIt 4 for DOS as well as WinCheckIt Pro. It
comes with Qualitas' RAMexam memory testing utility, McGraw-Hill's
CD-ROM Technical Reference Library and some old-fashioned system
tools: Phillips and flathead screwdrivers, as well as loopback plugs
that attach to serial and parallel ports.</P>

<P>The Windows portion of CheckIt focuses on a central control panel,
divided into several sections that give you access to all the
included software tools. A System Summary section offers
configuration data on bus, processor, memory, BIOS, ports, video
adapter and so forth. The Resource Monitor section graphically
displays CPU usage, swap file info, free memory and remaining disk
space. A Change Detector section lets you see modifications to
hardware, system and performance configurations.</P>

<P>I had only one major problem with the kit, which otherwise
performed as advertised. Although the manual offers lots of
information, it sometimes has trouble making distinctions between
16-bit Windows and Windows 95-which could be a potentially serious
problem for novice users. And, at $129.95, it's a bit over-priced for
what it does. </P>

<P>Still, this is a good choice for augmenting Windows 95's own
diagnostic tools, or for filling in the diagnostics gaps of older
operating systems.  </P>

<P>You scratched your favorite CD-ROM, and now it doesn't work. Don't
worry, there might be a solution to your problem. While it it true
that CD-ROMs are hardy little buggers, they still need special care.
They aren't made of steel and it's easy to scratch them. Just one
scratch or one fingerprint and your favorite CD won't work. The
solution: very often, you can get rid of scratches on a CD-ROM using
the same solution that you would use on a music CD. </P>

<P>You'll find CD scratch repair kits at music or stereo stores. Look
for a repair kit that includes a cloth, cotton balls, an extra bottle
of the cleaning goop, and instructions. If the CD-ROM still won't
work after you tried to fix it, call the CD-ROM's publisher. Many
publishers will send you  a replacement CD for just a fraction of its
original price. </P>

<h3>HP DeskJet 660C Could This SOHO Printer Be For You?</h3>
<p>

<h4>By Martin Waterman</h4>
<p>
<hr>
Having spent over three months evaluating Hewlett Packard's DeskJet 660C, I feel
that I am qualified to comment on its performance especially since I used it daily
and at times had it running for hours at a time.  I have also evaluated similar
printers from HP's competitors so I had a base from which to draw comparisons.<p>

<p>

Bubblejets and Inkjets have continued to drop in price and many computer users, 
especially those who operate in a small office or home office environment (SOHO)
are contemplating purchasing one of these machines.<p>

<p>

The HP DeskJet 660C printer is widely available including national chain stores
such as Walmart usually for under $ 400.00 dollars.  This availability is important
since some computer stores, particularly smaller ones do not like to tie up a lot of
money in ink cartridges for low production printers.   I ran into this problem with
Canon's portable BJC-70 printer.  Even large chains only stock a few cartridges so
if you rely on your printer you either have to stock up on ink or have a secure
supply.<p>

<p>

The 660C printer takes two ink cartridges, one for black and one for color. This is
a dramatic improvement over earlier and other models where you have to switch
cartridges when you need color.  With the 660C, if you do have a document with
color and text, both cartridges are used.  This saves the more expensive color
cartridge which does not have to do double duty as for both black and color.  In
addition, the black produced from a color cartridge is not a true black.  With the
Deskjet 660C you do get vivid colors and rich black text as both cartridges work at
the same time. <p>

There are many things I liked about the printer as well as some aggravating
features.  First, the good points.  The DeskJet 660C printer does have high quality
when it comes to printing on plain paper with black text and color images. This
enhanced print quality is achieved primarily through newly designed black and
color print heads and new ink formulas that yield more consistent output across a
wider range of media.  I found out how good the images were when I printed
photographs from the Internet and from the stock photos in Corel Draw.  I also
found that by using the more expensive glossy and clay coated papers that the
quality of the images improved even more.<p>

<p>

I found that HP Inkjets do have a superior black ink.  The black print cartridge
uses new pigment-based ink that produces a richer black and smaller, more
defined dots for sharper printing. This was important for me because I do a
number of newsletters and need crisp well-defined text.  The tri-color cartridge
uses new dye-based inks that produce more vibrant colors, dry faster and resist
fading.  This was also important because I do flyers, brochures an business cards
in small numbers.<p>

<p>

Another improvement over earlier designs is that HP enhanced its ColorSmart
technology to provide sharper images and smoother color patterns. ColorSmart
automatically selects the optimal color or gray scale tone for text, graphics and
photographic elements separately, simplifying color printing in much the same way
automatic settings on a 35mm camera will take the guess work out of taking
great-looking photographs. Other factors contributing to the advancement in print
quality include HP's  Resolution Enhancement technology (REt) for crisp edges and
increased resolution to 600 x 600 dots per inch (dpi) for black and up to 600 x 300
dpi for color.<p>

<p>

<b>Deskjet 660C in Practice</b><p>

<p>

Installation and setup was quick and easy.  I installed it on a 486 DX33 running
Windows 3.1  However, I did not know that Windows 95 did not include the printer
drivers for the 660C.  These had to be downloaded from HP's WWW site since I
changed operating systems while using the printer.  By the time you read this, the
printers should have the drivers unless it is older stock.  The printer is
plug-and-play and when I loaded Windows 95, it had no trouble finding and
configuring my printer.  Unfortunately it did not recognize my sound card, fax
board and CD-ROM but that is another article which I am considering calling
"Plug and Pray".<p>

<p>

I ran into a few other minor problems.  I wanted to print off a book manuscript
and the printer choked.  I kept getting messages part way through the printing job
that the printer had lost communication with the computer. I called HP and they
explained to me that a Deskjet is not a LaserJet. DeskJets do not have the type of
onboard memory as does a laser printer. They told me that the printer was not
designed to be a high volume printer and if your needs are for high output you
should consider a laser printer.<p>

<p>

I figure I ran off about 2000 sheets since I received the printer and only had one
paper jam.  The error message told me to go to the help menu and there was
nothing under paper jams which left the people at technical support a little
bewildered.  I gently removed the paper and all was well. <p>

<p>

The control panel is simple, only two buttons so it is easy to operate. The literature
states that the DeskJet 660C printer prints black at 4 pages per minute (ppm) and
color output at up to 1.5 ppm - twice as fast as its predecessor.   As fast as  this
might be, I found it to be slower but then again I tend to cram a lot of information
and graphics onto a single page.  HP attributes the increased speed to faster-firing
ink cartridges, a faster 68000 processor, twice the memory, and printer software
and firmware enhancements.   They also claim that the cost per page of color
printing with the DeskJet 660C printer is 50 percent less than with its predecessor,
thanks to the increased capacity of the color cartridge and improvements in the
color ink coverage.   If you want an additional 50 percent savings, the printer's
EconoFast mode lays down half the ink in both black and color.<p>

<p>

The printer turned out to be more versatile than I had imagined being able to
handle a wide range of media including letter, legal, executive and custom-size
paper, cards, envelopes, labels, transparencies, and glossy and coated paper.<p>

<p>

The input tray also automatically feeds 100 sheets of paper or 50 transparencies. A
new, single-envelope feeder allows users to feed envelopes without removing paper
from the input tray. Unlike competitors' inkjet printers which require manual
adjustments for printing envelopes, the HP printer features an automatic envelope
sensor so up to 20 envelopes or 30 cards can  be stacked in the input tray.<p>

	<p>

The DeskJet 660C printer comes standard with a three-year limited warranty, the
longest in the industry. The printers use only half the energy of previous models
and approximately 80 percent less than dot-matrix printers.<p>

<p>

The DeskJet 660C printers have also earned the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency's Energy Star designation for low power consumption.<b><p>

<h3>DESKTOP PUBLISHING FOR THE MASSES</h3>
<h4>Four low-priced DTP programs are reviewed</h4>
<p>

<h4></b>By: D. J.  Haynes</h4>
<p>
<hr>
OK, you need to design some new sales brochures or perhaps publish a monthly newsletter or  a
training manual. The
problem is that you've got too many other things to do -- and not enough cash in your budget to
hire that professional
design guy down the street. There's the day to day operations to run, accounts to keep, and phone
calls to return. In other
words, you've got very little time left to design and lay out marketing or advertising materials that
are an intricate part of
your business. <p>

Because small-business owners wear so many different hats, they'll appreciate the new easy-to-use
desktop publishing
software that's on the market these days. The new programs are  fairly inexpensive products that
can help you quickly
design your material and get on with other the other tasks needed to run your business. With the
right software, your
computer instantly becomes a typesetting and document layout powerhouse -- without your
having to learn the intricate
and sometimes painstaking art of typesetting.<p>

Even though one of the biggest hyped events in this year's DTP market was the release of
Windows 95, during our
testing for this article, only one page layout program had made the transition from Windows 3.1
to Windows 95:
Microsoft Publisher. Others -- Serif's PagePlus, Adobe PageMaker, Corel Ventura, and
QuarkXPress should be out by
the time you are reading  this, or shortly thereafter. The Windows 95 assault announced that
desktop publishing, in
particular, was one area that would benefit from the wonders of the new 32-bit operating system.
Despite all the
ballyhoo, recent industry news reports have shown that the business community has been slow to
adopt Windows 95 and
the related 32bit software on the market. So, it's hard  to decide if Windows 95 is the best thing to
happen to desktop
publishing (DTP) or not. <p>

One thing's for sure, the number of existing players in the DTP arena is dwindling. This is
probably due to a number of
factors, including improvements made to word processors over the past few years. In many cases,
it's often just as
efficient to use WordPerfect or Microsoft Word to lay out smaller documents. I'm told that the
layout of this magazine
has, from time to time, been done using WordPerfect 61. <p>

For the purpose of this article we will be reviewing four economy-minded products: Adobe Paint
&amp; Publish, Corel
Ventura, Microsoft Publisher, and Serif PagePlus. OK, really three economy minded products and
Ventura which is
arguably a high-end product due to its tremendous power and high learning curve.<p>

Historically, DTP software falls into one of two categories: professional packages such as
QuarkXPress, PageMaker,
FrameMaker and Ventura,  used by many book and magazine publishers and professional
designers, and the low-end
programs, which are for those who create occasional publications, such as a company brochure,
simple fliers, and so on.
Whether you need to step up to a professional package depends primarily on what kinds of
documents you want to
create.<p>

The differences in the two types, however, have become less discernible. Serif's PagePlus and
Corel Ventura are quite
efficient at creating the prepress color separations necessary to run full-color documents on a
printing press. This was
once the exclusive realm of such high-end programs as QuarkXPress. Still, Ventura is the only
product reviewed here
that is adept at creating long documents comprising several chapters or sections.<p>

The strength of the economical packages tend to be their ease of use. Although easy to use can
mean fewer features and
less power, this is generally not the case with the four programs here. Instead, they make those
features and that power
easier to wield by providing templates, helpful tips, wizards, and other mechanisms to help you lay
out your documents. <p>

Traditionally, Microsoft Publisher has led the way in usability. Its Wizards feature and on screen
tips, which take the
user down a predefined path, have taken almost all the guesswork out of basic document layout.
The new Windows 95
version provides even more help with newly designed dialog boxes that offer visual guides to help
you make decisions.
The Fancy First Letter (know as drop capitals in other programs) dialog box, for example, lets
you to select the style of
the drop cap and where it you want it placed in relation to the paragraph from a list of
examples.<p>

The other programs provide various levels of help, but they're not as extensive as Publisher's.
PagePlus, for instance,
offers Page Hints in its templates that guide you though adding and formatting text and graphics.
Ventura and Paint &amp;
Publish feature several professionally designed templates in which all you do is replace existing
text and graphics with
your own. Paint &amp; Publish also provides AutoCreate, a feature similar to Microsoft
Publisher's Wizards.<p>

When it comes to output, these four programs are very different  in two significant ways.
Microsoft Publisher and Adobe
Paint &amp; Publish are basically designed for printing on your desktop laser or ink-jet printer.
Corel Ventura and Serif
PagePlus are quite good at preparing documents for the print shop or image bureau. The
difference is each one's ability
to print color separations.<p>

There are two basic types of color documents. Spot color is the type that's used in simple
newsletters and stationery. It is
the type of stuff we see in the local newspaper when an advertisement has a splash of color 
highlighting a title or word.
Process color is used to print full-color ads and photographs, such as those used on the cover of
this magazine.<p>

Each one requires a different type of color separation. Although all four programs can print
spot-color separations, only
Ventura and PagePlus can print the full-color process separations. What this means is that if you
use process colors in
your Paint &amp; Publish or Microsoft Publisher layouts, the only way to reproduce them is on an
output device that can
print color, such as a color ink-jet or thermal wax printer. If you're ready for process separations,
you may also be ready
for a professional-strength DTP program. <p>

To review each program, we laid out two types of documents. A one-page, full-color magazine
cover, tested each
program's ability to import, place, and print color graphics. Use of  a  couple of articles for the
magazine allowed us to
sample text formatting, style sheets, and some long document features, such as page numbering,
indexing, table of
contents, and others. The results were interesting, as you'll see in the following reviews.<p>

<b>Corel Ventura 5:  </b>Although Corel Ventura lacks the ease-of-use features of the other
low-end DTP programs here and
its suggested list of  $495 for the CD-ROM version makes the others look like bargains, Corel
offers so many ways to
get the software for $199 that we included it in the review as a low-cost alternative to other
full-featured programs. You
can, for example, get Ventura for less than $200 in a competitive upgrade from virtually any other
desktop publishing
program. You can also get this special upgrade price from any earlier version of Xerox Ventura
Publisher or from
CorelDraw 3 or 4. If you already have CorelDraw 5.0, then you have Ventura as a part of that
program.<p>

Even at full price, it still runs approximately $400 less than Adobe's PageMaker or QuarkXPress.
In addition, about the
time you read this, Corel should be releasing Corel Ventura 6, a Windows 95 application the
company claims will be
quite different from the current version. Corel plans to sell version 5 at a substantial discount.<p>

In our tests, Ventura completed all it's tasks with relative ease. It has great process-color support,
and its long-document
features are some of the best in the business, topping even those of more expensive QuarkXPress
and PageMaker. In
addition to solid multiple file compilation and management, Ventura creates tables of contents and
indices very easily. It
also automatically numbers and renumbers figures and tables, and it includes  several special
catalog and directory
page-numbering options. <p>

All this power comes at a price, however. Ventura is not an easy program to learn and master,
unless you're a
CorelDraw user. Wherever possible, Corel made Ventura's interface resemble CorelDraw. Corel
has done a great job of
migrating most of the commands and options from the nested dialog boxes of earlier versions
onto moveable palettes
called Roll-ups. Ventura also uses CorelDraw's print, color management, and color creation
dialog boxes, which are
easy to use and powerful. <p>

In addition to all that power, you get an arsenal of extras and utilities, including the CorelMosaic
image cataloging
utility, 650 Type 1 and TrueType fonts, 17,000 clip art images, 100 color photos, and 75
professionally designed
templates. <p>

Ventura also comes bundled with Corel Photo-Paint, a full-featured image editing program?
Photo-Paint is second only
to Adobe Photoshop for powerful image touch-up and enhancement, and it comes with several
industry standard
special-effects plug-ins.<p>

These extras alone may be worth the $495 price tag. But remember, don't buy it at full-price, get
it as an upgrade for
$199. <p>

There was a time when Ventura was owned by Xerox and called Ventura Publisher. It was
ungainly and very difficult to
learn and use. But Corel has turned it around and made Ventura a viable alternative for people
who need brute-strength
desktop publishing at a very reasonable price.<p>

<b>Adobe Paint &amp; Publish</b> is the only Mac publishing program in this review, Adobe
Paint &amp; Publish is
a combination page layout (HomePublisher) and paint (SuperPaint) bundle. Since acquiring
HomePublisher, Adobe has added Adobe SuperPaint, a relatively full-featured image editing
program
for touching up photographs and creating graphics. Also included in this CD-ROM Deluxe
version are
1,500 pieces of clip art, a handful of fonts, and 50 templates.<p>

HomePublisher fared well enough on laying out the magazine cover, although it provided no way
to
print the process separations. The program was great in laying out the pages for the articles.
HomePublisher has a strong style sheets feature, making formatting multiple paragraphs a snap. It
also imports style sheets from word processors, such as Microsoft Word and MacWrite II.
Unfortunately, HomePublisher cannot compile multiple documents into one long book or manual,
and
it provides no way to generate even simple tables of contents or indices. <p>

One of HomePublisher's most interesting features is AutoCreate. Similar to Microsoft Publisher's
Wizards, AutoCreate uses a set of scripts to create a layout according to your specifications. The
script prompts you for document size, number of columns, tone, and several other  settings and
then
creates a template based on your responses. You can even fill in headlines, headers and footers,
and
captions during the AutoCreate process, and the program automatically places them in the
document.<p>

The program supports spot-color separations as well as crop and press registration marks, making
reproducing two- and three-color documents at the print shop easier. You can even use the color
palette to display objects on separate color plates. If you only have a monochrome monitor, this
feature helps correctly print your separations.<p>

Disappointingly, HomePublisher does not support the Pantone Matching System (PMS)
spot-color
model. You'll have to pick your colors from a swatch book after you get to the print shop.
Professionals typically work the other way around, adding color as they design their
document.<p>

The inclusion of SuperPaint makes HomePublisher an especially good value. Although not as
powerful as Ventura or Adobe's own PageMaker, it is great at newsletters, brochures, and other
short
documents -- especially on a modestly equipped Macintosh.<p>

<b>Microsoft Publisher for Windows 95:</b>  Microsoft Publisher approaches page layout with
the
attitude that most people don't want to learn desktop publishing, they just want to get their
documents laid out. So, what you get is a somewhat quirky but quite capable DTP program.<p>

Microsoft Publisher didn't finish either of our tests. It could not print  the separations for our
magazine cover, nor could it compile our long articles. So why do I think it's still a great buy?
Mainly,
because it provided excellent control over text formatting and graphics importing. Its page
numbering
and other basic layout options are very good. The program is exceptionally good for those who
need to
whip out their documents fast.<p>

The program has a treasure trove of easy-to-use features, including Wizards that query you with
style
and content questions and then create a document based on your responses. All you do is pour in
your
text and graphics. In addition to Wizards and the Help system (context-sensitive tips), the
program
now supports PageWizards that walk you though the creation of about 20 different common
documents. A Design Gallery contains predesigned page elements, such as banners, that you
simply
drag into your document and add your own test or graphics to. <p>

One interesting feature is Publisher's ability to open Microsoft Word automatically when you need
to
edit text extensively. I was also impressed with the Layout Checker, which looks over the
document
and points out layout problems and makes suggestions on how to correct them.<p>

Microsoft Publisher's use of "understandable terminology" for common desktop publishing terms,
however, means that drop caps are called Fancy First Letters, for example, and kerning is called
Character Spacing. Another area where Microsoft seems to listen to its own drums is in printing
and
applying color. It does not support the Pantone Matching System, the industry standard
spot-color
matching process. Nor does it support process-color separations.  <p>

The program does print a checklist for users to take to the print shop with them, but colors are
defined in RGB (red, green, and blue) values rather than the industry standard CMYK (cyan,
magenta, yellow, and black). Monitors use RGB values, but few print shops know what to do
with
RGB definitions.<p>

But, these things may not be important to non-desktop publishers who are only interested in
getting
their documents out quickly and painlessly. And if that's all you want to do, what Microsoft
Publisher
lacks in power it makes up for in convenience.<p>

<b>Serif Pageplus Publishing Suite:</b>  Ever since version 1.0, Serif has made sure that
PagePlus is a
step ahead and a great value. That first version offered spot-color separations and artistic text
manipulation; version 2.0 was the first inexpensive package to offer process-color separations;
and so
on. The new CD-ROM publishing suite version is no exception. <p>

I don't know how they do it. Serif continues to pack more useful features into PagePlus while
keeping the cost down.
Now, with its new PagePlus Publishing Suite, Serif has taken another significant step by providing
all the publishing
power most of us will ever need--page layout, word processing, drawing, image editing, loads of
fonts, and tons of clip
art--in one affordable package ($199 street price).<p>

At the suite's core is PagePlus 3.0. Included among the new features are automatic hyphenation, a
tab and leader ruler,
Hints and Tips, and document creation of up to 999 pages.<p>

Like PageMaker, PagePlus uses a pasteboard table metaphor. The interface actually resembles a
printing press stripper's
workstation. Though you can create long publications with PagePlus, it didn't pass the test
because it can't automatically
generate indices and tables of contents--two features essential for long-document creation. The
program is more suitable
for shorter, business-oriented documents, such as newsletters or brochures. <p>

Version 3.0 provides several new learning features, including event-driven hints and tips,
multimedia
demos, layout checking, and links to pertinent help topics in all dialog boxes. Among the other
packages reviewed here, these are options available only in Microsoft Publisher and should make
PagePlus simple to learn and use. In addition to all the learning aids, an innovative ease-of-use
option lets you customize the interface to three levels of difficulty: Intro, Publisher, and
Professional.
Although not quite as automatic as Publisher, PagePlus holds its own in the ease-of-use
department.<p>

As impressive as PagePlus's layout prowess is, it is the other stuff bundled on the CD-ROM
greatly
enhances the program's value. In addition to PagePlus, you get TypePlus, a type special-effects
package similar to Adobe's TypeAlign, which allows you to fit text on a path, warp it, fill it with
special effects, and so forth. DrawPlus lets you work with vector images. TablePlus lets you
create
spreadsheet-like tables. PhotoPlus lets you edit photographs. There are all kinds of fonts and clip
art.<p>

Serif is working on a Windows 95 version of PagePlus, which will include several additional
ease-of-use features, newly designed templates, and other enhancements. Why wait, however,
when
the current version runs so well under Windows 95? All that would really help this program is
better
support for long documents. It would then truly be a great low-cost alternative to PageMaker.
<p>

Combine PagePlus's brute page layout strength with all these useful applets and what do you get?
More desktop
publishing power than most people will need in their lifetimes. In fact, it's probably more than you
will ever need. But at
such a great price, it's worth it.<p>

<b>Conclusions:</b> In the page layout software market, companies strike a balance between
ease of use
and features. Microsoft Publisher for Windows 95, for example, almost completely insulates the
user
from the page layout process with automation and prefabricated documents. Corel Ventura's
power
requires you to learn desktop publishing concepts and techniques. PagePlus offers value by
throwing
in almost all the software you'll ever need to complete your layouts, and Adobe System's Paint
&amp;
Publish provides power and ease of use to the Macintosh market.<p>

<h3><b>USING A COPY SHOP TO SAVE
TIME AND CRANK OUT
QUALITY DOCUMENTS</b></h3><P>

By Trisha Roberts<p>
<hr>
You're a small-business owner with that entrepreneurial instinct that says you should do everything
yourself. After all, you can save money and have more control over your work right?  Why pay for
expensive printouts, when you can get them for free by using your office printer? While this outlook is
sometimes very useful, it's not always the best way to go. <p>

Take, for example, the process of producing your marketing brochures, flyers, rate cards and training
materials. Your office printer can be ideal for many tasks, but mass output and reproduction of
four-color documents aren't among them. That's where a print shop comes in. Using a professional
output service can save time and might even  make your materials -- and you -- look their best. <p>

You've probably been to a print shop to use a copy machine. But many of them do much more than
just make copies. Our local Kinkos, for example, prepares artwork and page layouts for publication; it
can also produce large quantities of your brochures and newsletters In other words, a print shop
takes your files and prints them for you. <p>

If you're producing just a few copies of simple, single-color documents, then your ink-jet or laser
printer is probably fine. But if you're talking about hundreds of copies, or if you want to print in
four-color, then your local copy shop might be the answer. Here's everything you need to know about
finding a print shop and preparing your files.<p>

<b>Weigh your options:</b><p>

Before you decide to go to a print shop, consider both the benefits and the drawbacks. First, rather
than the 300, 600, or 1,200dpi resolution your office printer provides, most print shops output your
documents at 2,540dpi, and even higher. The payoff is in thinner, smoother, crisper type that's free of 
curves or diagonals that look jagged. The difference will be even more noticeable if your documents
include screens (text set against shades of gray), graduated fills (smooth transitions from light to
dark), or scanned photographs (called halftones). <p>

Speed is also a factor. Your office printer is fine for everyday tasks. But when you start talking about
hundreds of copies -- especially documents with graphics -- you'll realize that your printer isn't the
speed demon. of the highway for this type of output. Even if you're producing a text-only newsletter, a
copy shop can crank out 500 copies much more quickly than your printer can -- and you won't have to
replace your toner or print cartridge every month (which can get very expensive). <p>

Of course, this service comes at a price. For common copy jobs that you bring a printout, you can
expect to pay between $.03 and .05 cents per copy. Double-sided are a bit more. Sometimes it pays to
buy a ream of paper at the store or bring your own paper for the copy job with you. For more technical
jobs, such as the copy shop working with your files on a disk, you can expect to pay between $1 to $5
for normal printouts and up to $20 per original page for graphic heavy jobs. The cost drops as you
make more copies. This is certainly a  big difference from the $.05 to .25 cents a page you'd normally
spend to use your ink-jet or laser printer. Also, there are a number of logistical tasks you have to
complete before you send out your work.<p>

<b>Ask Questions:</b><br>

The first step is to locate a print shop that wants your work. Many of our area shops are Mac heavy
and you find them to be somewhat snippy if you go to them with a PC based file (more on this later).
Check around before going to make sure that the shop can handle the files you are using.   Check
under Desktop Publishing, Printers, Copiers, and Typesetting in the yellow pages. Then ask your
business associates for recommendations. Alternatively, contact local designers and ask whom they
use. You can also call some of the general computer clubs listed in our user group section and ask
them. <p>

Once you've found a few candidates, make sure you ask the right questions. How much do you charge
per page? This depends on the size of page, the number of colors in your document, whether you're
printing on both sides of a page, paper stock, and so on. Be prepared to pay more if you're producing a
tabloid or other nonstandard-size document.<p>

Ask how much they  charge for processing complex graphics and scanned photographic images?
Because complex graphics (detailed illustrations containing numerous outlines and fills) and scanned
photos require more processing time than straight text does, costs go up as the complexity of your
documents increases.<p>

How do they prefer your files be given to them? Some print shops like getting files on floppy disk;
others request modem transmission. If your files contain large scanned images that are unlikely to fit
on a single disk, find out what type of removable storage media your print shop uses. Usually, a
professional operation can accept files on a SyQuest disk, although the new Iomega Zip disk is
gaining in popularity.<p>

Are you familiar with my format? Most print shops are Macintosh based. That's starting to change,
however, because most small businesses are Windows based. Kinkos, one of the largest national
chains, recently announced that Microsoft Publisher is the standard desktop publishing software at
700 of its stores. Still, if you're using a Windows-based desktop publishing program, you might
experience more difficulty locating a print shop that welcomes your work. Some will routinely convert
Windows files to the Macintosh format before imaging, which can lead to such problems as
inappropriate font substitutions, fonts defaulting to Courier, and system crashes. <p>

Are my fonts available? If your print shop doesn't have the fonts you're using, your document will
revert to its imagesetter's default typeface, typically a typewriter-like font such as Courier. In that
case, you'll have to provide the fonts when you deliver your files. <p>

Even though you are taking your work to a professional print shop, many things can still go wrong.
The key is preparation on your part. <p>

Give 'em your graphics. Make sure you supply copies of all linked graphics files. If you don't give a
copy of the original graphics file, your print shop output will be based on the jagged, coarse screen
image you see on your computer's monitor -- roughly 72dpi.<p>

Print out a hard copy. Your office printer still comes in handy even when you're using a print shop.
It's a good idea to attach a copy of your document so the print shop can use it as a guide. These
professionals should be able to compare what's coming out of an imagesetter with what you wanted to
emerge. That way, they can instantly identify such problems as missing typefaces and graphics files.
If you're preparing color separations (a different layer for each of the ink colors that, together, will
create your document), submit a color proof that's been prepared on an ink-jet color printer.
Alternatively, use colored markers to indicate where color will appear in the printed document.<p>

Use styles properly. When creating your document, choose bold and italics by selecting the bold and
italics versions of the typeface from the typeface menu instead of clicking on the bold and italics
icons. Sometimes, the software will substitute an awkward, heavier, or slanted version of the Roman
font, rather than the correct redesigned bold and italic variations. <p>

Keep it simple. Until you have experience, avoid sophisticated effects. These include illustrations
with numerous fill patterns, graduated fills, "files within files," and advanced Photoshop effects. Make
copies. Never, ever, send the only copy of your files out to a vendor.<p>

Keep a list. Unless you're providing EPS (post script) files, always supply a written list of all fonts
used in your publication. Also include a list of the software, with version numbers, used to create the
graphics incorporated in your pages.<p>

Choose your fonts wisely. Whenever possible, use PostScript Type 1 fonts. These were designed for
imagesetting. Although TrueType fonts (the ones that come with Windows) offer many advantages
and are gaining popularity with print shops.<p> 

Go with the best. Stick to "mainstream" word processing and page layout programs. The print shop
staff should  be experienced with such software and will know the pitfalls to avoid when imaging your
document.<p> 

Keep in mind that the printer on your desk will handle most of your output chores. But if it turns out
you need to use a print shop, make sure you're prepared. Then sit back, relax and let someone else do
the work for a change.<p>

<b>Road Map Software</b><p>
By Martin P. Waterman<p>

<hr>

If you do much traveling, either for business or pleasure, there are three popular road map software
packages that will help you efficiently and effectively plan and reach your destination. One question
you may be thinking is "why not just go out and purchase a road atlas?"  Good point, however, road
map software offers much more in the way of information than can be contained on a road map.  The
power of these programs is in the database and how they are able to assemble mass amounts of
information quickly that could be useful in planning and executing your trip.  Incidently, the Delorme
and Rand-McNally also come with full sized hard copy Atlases.  Rand-McNally also throws in a book
of coupons for with travel discounts although you probably won't use many of them since they are
specific to certain areas.<p>

<p>

All three programs are relatively inexpensive with street prices in the $ 50.00 to $ 60.00 range.  All
programs will print out maps and a travel itinerary.  For printing, I liked the Rand-McNally program. 
For fast reference, Automap was my choice and to indulge in trying to find attractions and stops
along the way, I gravitated towards the Delorme product.<p>

<p>

As it happens, the road map segment of the software industry is competitive.   Other products include
Expert TravelPlanner Gold Edition by Expert Software.  This product is not worth mentioning since
for the approximately $ 10.00 saving in price compared to the others, you are getting a much more
inferior product.  Another CD-ROM program, AAA Trip Planner from Compton's New Media sells for
about $ 40.00 dollars but it does not give you a choice among the shortest, quickest and most scenic
routes and, therefore, lacks the versatility of the three programs reviewed below.   The AAA product,
however, does print the best looking maps but prepare to invest some time waiting since printing a
highly detailed map takes much time and memory. However, be warned, it does not include maps of
Canada or Mexico and is sparse on features.  There are a few other products but they are really not
worth mentioning.  At last tally, the two market leaders were Rand-McNally with 47% of the market
and Delorme with 20% of the market for road map software.<p>

<p>

<b> Delorme Map 'n' Go</b>: <p>

Delorme seems to have bet heavily on the future of computing by only offering their road map in the
CD-ROM format.  Personally, I think this is a mistake since at the time of this writing, many
travelers like to take their notebook computers with them and few notebooks are equipped with
CD-ROMs. You could print out all the information pertaining to your trip beforehand but what
happens if there is a change in plans?  The best thing about these programs are their databases and if
you can't access them along the way, your getting short-changed.  Perhaps Delorme should do some
cross merchandising and offer a 50% off coupon on an external CD-ROM player to make up for their
exuberance.<p>

<p>

Ordinarily, I really would not harp about the CD-ROM thing except for the fact that there is so much
useful information (31,000 hotels, inns, campgrounds, restaurants and other points of interest
throughout Canada, the U.S., Mexico and the Caribbean) which probably accounts for the fact that
the program became an instant best-seller with over 100,000 units sold within three months of
introduction.  I know what your thinking, with all that information, if they did offer a diskette
version, you could never fit it on your hard drive.  Good point but there could be a feature where you
could selectively install the information you want.  For instance, if your driving from Toronto to San
Francisco, you don't need all that information on the east coast, Mexico or the Caribbean. 	<p>

Delorme is also the king when it comes to road miles with over 1,000,000. That is almost double what
Microsoft's Automap has to offer.  However, they only have 50,000 cities and towns against 125,000
for Rand-McNally and 120,000 for Automap.<p>

<p>

If you are blessed with a CD-ROM player in your desktop or lap top, you can have so much trip
information that it will give you a wide choice of destinations.  When the program is creating your
map, you can tell it to include points of interest within five 10, 20 or even 50 miles of the proposed
route.  There is often narration that accompanies the points of interest as well as photos.  The
program can even put together a slide show of all the interesting sights along your proposed trip
route.  Of course, you get to print your map and travel plans  but I did not find it as good as
Rand-McNally's output.<p>

<p>

Another feature of this program is that it can save you money calling directory assistance or hunting
zip codes since any town in the data base can call up a list on local zip codes, area codes and local
phone exchanges. Retailing for about $50.00 bucks, this program is one of the more useful CD-ROM
titles available today.  In addition to needing a CD-ROM capable computer, you will also need 4MB of
RAM and 3MB of Hard Drive space. Delorme also makes a popular CD-ROM product called Street
Atlas USA as well as other CD-ROM mapping titles for consumers and business.<p>

<b><p>

Microsoft Automap Road Atlas:</b> <p>

Automap Road Atlas sold over 300,000 copies before its recent incarnation as a Microsoft Home
product resulting from Microsoft purchasing the program from NextBase Ltd.  The good points about
this product are its simplicity of use and two unique features.  The first allows you to enter in your
cost of gasoline, the size of your gas tank and your mileage for city and highway driving.  You set the
speed of your journey and the program will calculate how much gas and the cost of the gas you will
use.  You can even tell the program to remind you to fill up when there is only so much gas left and
this is done by adding a gas pump icon along the route of your trip.  Be conservative when using this
feature since there may not always be a gas station at the place where you are supposed to fill up.<p>

<p>

The program will also plot the time you should reach certain destinations based on your start and
finish time and the speed you choose. Automap Road Atlas contains 145,000 places in the United
States and Northern Mexico.  It contains several hundred thousand less miles of  roads than Rand
McNally, but then again, you are only getting Northern Mexico and as far as I could tell, they did not
cut corners on their maps of Canada and the US when I compared the two.  Automap also has short
descriptions and facts for states, provinces and cities that I found to be useful. <p>

<p>

One new feature for automap allows the user to draw a box around certain areas they want to avoid
when traveling (sort of like East L.A. during riot season).  Actually, you can avoid construction areas,
roads that are bad or particularly dangerous in the winter or any area you would rather pass by.  The
program then compensates for your wishes and chooses an alternative route.  Rand-McNally's
TripMaker also allows you to avoid segments of road.<p>

<p>

This program gives you a choice between CD-ROM and disks.  For the CD-ROM version, Microsoft
recommends a 256 color SVGA monitor although a VGA will suffice.  You will need at least 3.5 MB of
disk space with the recommended amount being 8MB.  For diskettes,  you will need between 6-8 MB
of hard drive space depending on which features you want to load.  Automap Road Atlas also contains
1600 fact-filled articles and the CD-ROM version has an additional 1100 color photographs. 	<p>

Automap is also available for Macintosh computers, System 7 or later with 4MB of RAM.  For
business use, there is also Microsoft Automap Pro that carries a suggested retail around $100.  This
product is designed to manage sales, customer support and business travel and includes a
professional database.  <p>

<p>

<b>Rand McNally TripMaker:</b>  The first thing I liked about Rand McNally is that they give you the
choice between CD-ROM or disks.  I actually loaded the software on a notebook computer in order to
run "what if" and actual vacation and business travel scenarios. 	<p>

TripMaker has a rich database (640,900 miles of road and 125,000 cities and towns) and it prints out
a trip log (based on your input) showing you which exits to take, distances and attractions along the
route.     	<p>

The complete installation from disk takes a minimum of 11 MB of hard disk space and if you want to
install all the databases, you will need 15MB.  The CD ROM version requires 1MB or hard disk space
and a double-speed CD-ROM drive.<p>

<p>

While using the three road map software packages, I found myself continually using the
Rand-McNally product which also proved easy to use.  I was surprised that the maps even looked
good on a dot-matrix printer. <p>

<p>

Some of the features of TripMaker include 88 pre-planned scenic tours developed by Rand McNally's
travel experts, budget estimates for hotels, gas, meals and entertainment and reference information
on border crossings, toll roads, and toll free phone numbers for airlines car rentals and hotels. 	Rand McNally was founded in 1856 and is the world's largest commercial map maker.  They are
credited with developing the first nationwide road numbering system.<p>

<p>

TripMaker is designed for a family or individual planning a vacation that includes auto travel in
Canada, the United States and Mexico. The secondary market is for the business auto traveler.  If
you are using Automap, KeyMap, Expert TravelPlanner, AAA Trip Planner or Delorme's Map 'n' go,
you can get a competitive upgrade for about $ 40.00.<p>

<p>

<b>Conclusion:</b>	Automap and Map 'n' go use Government maps while Rand-McNally uses their own proprietary ones. 
Both Rand- McNally and Map 'n' Go are cross indexed with their road atlases.  All three programs
have a comprehensive on-line help.  In addition they all allow you to select the quickest and shortest
route while Rand-McNally is the only one to allow you to choose the scenic route.  This is a very
important feature since the majority of road map software users are vacationers (estimated at
75-80%) and not business travelers.<p>

<p>

Whichever program you do choose, it will make planning your trip a snap and open up a wide palate
of possibilities along the way that you may have never previously considered. <p>

<p>

</b><h4>By William Vosburg</h4>
</center>
<p>
<hr>
When a company decides to begin work on designing a brochure the first thing to be
determined isn't how it will look but rather how much your budget is.  Do you, for
example, have the funds to send the project to a print shop? Is there room in the
budget for  high- resolution, camera-ready output from a service bureau, or will the
company laser printer have to suffice?<p>

<p>

These type of considerations are even more important to the small business/ home
office owner<p>

<p>

Today's low-cost desktop publishing programs (Microsoft Publisher, Serif's PagePlus,
and Home Publisher, to name a few) as well as the power of most word processing
programs place powerful publishing tools at your fingertips. Though these type of
products will help hold down the cost of producing your business's promotional
material, they can't do it alone.<p>

<p>

When you're designing a flyer or  brochure on a limited budget, a little knowledge
about mass document production can result in a well-received product that won't
break your budget. <p>

<p>

<b>Use Templates:  </b>If you're like most occasional small business owners/desktop
publishers, you create promotional material, such as the company brochure, using
time that could be better spent dealing with clients. And like most people, you don't
want to spend all of your free time learning the ins and outs of a complicated Desktop
Publishing program. But, wait, there's still hope for you. Most DTP and graphics
programs ship with brochure templates that take much of the guesswork out of the
process. The templates in any of these packages can shave hours off the time it takes
to create a brochure. <p>

<p>

The results you get from these programs are often quite good. I know some of you will
say that using such templates will cause their brochures to look too much like
everybody else's. Just keep in mind that templates are just guides, and you can always
modify them by changing the  type styles and colors or by rearranging the layout
altogether. This takes a little more time, but it's still a lot faster than starting from
scratch.<p>

<p>

<b>Can We Print it Ourselves?:</b> The obvious alternative to relying on an expensive
professional output service is to use a laser printer or copy machine for reproduction.
This is an adequate solution if you stick with text and monotone graphics, such as
black-and-white clip art, but keep in mind that photographs and other gray scale
graphics will not reproduce well on such devices. <p>

<p>

In addition, the more copies you make, the less cost-effective these methods will
become. Five hundred copies on a small laser printer, for instance, can wipe out a
toner cartridge (which can cost more than $100) and cause<p>

considerable wear and tear on the printer. Overall, the important issue is cost per
piece, or how much each brochure actually costs to reproduce. I recently designed a
brochure that was a tri-fold, double-sided affair. I needed 1,000 copies and, while I
could have printed this in-house on a laser printer, it was more cost effective to have
them run off at a copy shop.<p>

<p>

<b>Is Color For You? </b> If you're  budget is high and you plan to use color images in your
brochure, then count on going to a print shop. Granted, color ink-jet printers can
provide some great output these days, they are slow and costly for large jobs. Of
course, you don't want to go bankrupt just because you're using a professional service,
and there <p>

<p>

are several ways to hold down the cost of getting good color output.<p>

<p>

One thing you need to know is that there are two types of color: spot, which typically
consists of one or two colors scattered throughout a document; and process, or four
color, which is used in full-color photographs<p>

and graphics. Print shops typically charge for each spot color you use: Expect to pay
about $35-50 for each spot color you add to a document.<p>

<p>

To get the most for your money, use percentages of spot colors, also known as screens
or tints, in logos and shaded text boxes. Because tints use the same ink that goes into
spot colors, print shops don't charge extra. Several programs, including Microsoft
Publisher, CorelDraw, even Word for Windows, allow you to create tints.  <p>

<p>

Process-color brochures run about three or four times the cost of single-color
brochures, though the price per document drops considerably as you increase the
number of copies printed. <p>

<p>

Using colored paper is another low-cost alternative for adding color to your brochure.
My Brochures and Nebs's Page Magic ([800] 388-8000) both offer several attractive
selections that feature stylized borders and designs that provide professional looking
results even from laser printers. Several other independent providers such as Paper
Direct ([800] 272-7377) also offer designer paper at a reasonable cost.<p>

<p>

Another point worth  mentioning is that even though print shops are expensive, the
biggest cost is in the initial setup, so the more copies you have printed, the more
cost-effective the service becomes.<p>

   <p>

Whether you design your own brochure from scratch or use a template, reproduce it
on a copier or use a print shop for expensive process color, you have plenty of
cost-cutting options. At no time before have so many people had such an extensive
array of publishing options at their fingertips--at a cost many of us small-business
people can actually afford.<p>

<h3><b>Gyroscopic Mice Put New Spin
on Computing</b></h3><p>
<h4>By Craig Crossman<h4><p>
<hr>

The first image that pops into mind when I think of a gyroscope is the little toy you
wind with a string. Pull the string, and the spinning gyro balances on the tip of a
pencil or glides along a string, much like a circus performer on a high wire. It's a
wonderful way to introduce the concept of gyroscopic forces. <p>  

Try to rotate a spinning gyroscope in mid-air, and you feel a strong resistance to
any change in position. This force is used in navigational equipment on rockets,
planes and boats to give suspended objects a reference point. And now, it's been
harnessed by a new type of computer mouse from Gyration. <p>  

Several years ago, I wrote about Gyration's first generation of mouse to use a
gyroscope. You could literally hear the whine of its tiny internal scope. The
company has since introduced two ergonomically designed lightweight mice that
use a new solid state gyroscopic wire that vibrates rather than spins. <p> 

Electronic sensors detect changes in this motion, which results in a highly accurate
lightweight mouse that can work in mid-air or on a desk. <p>  

A first look at the GyroPoint Desk reveals nothing out of the ordinary. It looks like
a typical corded mouse, with two buttons on top and buttons on the left and right
sides. You may not notice anything out of the ordinary if you use it like any other
mouse. GyroPoint contains a standard rubberized mouse ball; moving it on a
surface causes the pointer to respond in a corresponding direction. <p> 

However, picking up the mouse moves you into a new dimension. Off the desk, the
mouse acts like an extension of the user's hand. Moving the wrist in any direction
causes corresponding cursor motion. <p> 

A user could hold the mouse in the air, under a desk or with a portable computer
in an area where desktop space is limited (such as in an airplane seat) and move
the cursor by making slight up, down, left, right or diagonal wrist movements. <p> 

Included software lets you adjust motion sensitivity. The two buttons on the side
allow the cursor to be parked or frozen. This is especially handy when you find
yourself out of room in a particular direction and still need to move the mouse a bit
further. <p>

This is tantamount to lifting an ordinary mouse off the surface and repositioning
it. Since the GyroPoint Desk is already off the desk surface, this mechanism is
necessary. Without it, you might find yourself flailing your mouse arm in the face
of the person next to you on the plane. <p> 

The other gyroscopic mouse from Gyration is called the GyroPoint Pro. It's a
cordless gyroscopic mouse that's intended for use only as an off-the- desk pointer.
It does not contain the rubber ball for desktop tracking. <p>

The Pro also requires a small receiver box. Since it uses radio signals, there is no
line-of-sight requirement, as with cordless devices that use infrared light to
communicate with the computer. The Pro works up to 75 feet away from the
receiver and makes an ideal presentation pointer device. <p>
 
Both mice come in Windows and Macintosh versions. GyroPoint Desk sells for
$149; GyroPoint Pro, for $399.  Gyration (800) 316-5432 or (408) 255-3016 <p>

<b>BAH, HUMBUG!' </b><p>

You're correct if you think the holidays have unleashed a wave of new and exciting
computer games. And there's a good chance that employees will be installing these
new and exciting games on office computers. Now you have the
opportunity to bring Scrooge to the 20th Century. That's probably what employees
will call you as you merrily install "UnGame for Windows" throughout the office
network. <p> 

According to UnGame publisher DVD, "The annual cost of games at work in terms
of lost productivity, in the U.S. alone, is estimated to be $50 billion."  
That's one heck of a lot of Solitaire if you ask me, but I acknowledge that
game playing at work does exist. UnGame 2.0 for Windows ($59.99 per file
server) installs on any Windows PC and can recognize and eliminate over 3,100
games. Many educational institutions have observed UnGame reclaiming untold
megabytes of valuable disk storage space. UnGame's title-recognition database
is constantly being updated as new games appear. It's guaranteed to bring a smile
to your office Scrooge. <p>

<h3>FREELANCE AND POWERPOINT REVIEWED</h3>
<h4>Help for your Desktop Presentation Needs </h4>
<hr>
<p>

With all this talk about desktop publishing in this month's issue we decided to also
look at presentation graphics programs. These are those nifty programs that turn
your PC into a slide or multimedia presentation station. In some instances giving a
"live" presentation in color on the desktop or portable PC may go further than the
printed page can. It's a given that we need a word processor, and communications
program, maybe even a spreadsheet and an organizer, but do you need
presentation graphics? For more and more small-business owners, the answer is a
big fat  "Yes." <p>

<p>

These packages aren't just for professional speakers or those trying to sway a
corporate boardroom. If you're in business at almost any level, you'll encounter
plenty of occasions when you have to sell your products, your services, or yourself.
This is where presentation graphics software comes in.<p>

<p>

The category has evolved, and so some software publishers are now adding what is
called "content help" to their programs. Instead of simply helping you create a
presentation that looks good, these packages now help you create a presentation
that has more compelling ideas.<p>

<p>

In addition to slides and transparencies, all the programs reviewed here were able
to produced beautiful hard-copy proposals in both color and black and white. These
programs also help you produce all sorts of documents, including training
materials and new business plans. All created presentations that can run on your
computer as a screen show, replete with fancy transition effects between slides.
Most let you add sound and animation, and all contain runtime players for
multimedia. That means you can "print" a presentation to floppy disk and show it
on any computer -- even one that doesn't have the program you used to create your
presentation.<p>

<p>

<b>Freelance Graphics for Windows 95 </b> has long been a favorite among both users
and critics. But with such a long time between updates, the program was starting
to show its age. Now, the prerelease version for Windows 95 shows that Freelance
is headed back to the top of the presentation graphics world. The program sports a
host of new features in almost every area, though most notable are enhancements
for team computing, content help, and overall productivity. <p>

 <p>

Freelance is part of Lotus's new workgroup approach to computing. You can now
distribute presentations for review on floppy disks, over a network, or via e-mail.
Reviewers can make comments on screen, using the included annotation tools,
without changing the presentation itself. And multiple comments are color coded
for different reviewers and automatically consolidated into each revision. Although
this may sound like it was designed with corporate users in mind, the approach
does have plenty of benefits for the small-business owner as well. As an example, 
you could send presentations to clients electronically instead of  faxing them or
sending them via snail mail.<p>

 <p>

The content Lotus provides is quite impressive. Much of it comes from experts in
the various fields (for example, marketing experts Trout &amp; Ries contributed the
content advice of the Positioning Proposal template). Another plus is that you can
customize the content of the SmartMasters so that others may create presentations
and proposals based on your knowledge and expertise.<p>

<p>

Lotus has built on Freelance's reputation as an easy-to-use package with an really
great interface. There are  125 SmartMasters that will help speed you to a finished
presentation. Freelance also offers more multimedia support than previous
versions and some superb interface enhancements built around the Windows 95
screen conventions.<p>

<p>

There are so many changes to Freelance that we can't even begin to cover them all
here. But two more that are particularly worth mentioning are improved text
handling and a Rehearse Mode to help you practice your presentation. <p>

<p>

Freelance Graphics has made a huge leap over what was already a fine product.
Simple to use, flexible, and with a host of new features, Freelance is great buy for
your presentation needs.<p>

<p>

Not to be outdone is Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95. PowerPoint for
Windows 95, which is also part of the new Office for Windows 95 suite, is an
outstanding program with features that will help you design and deliver
presentations in your office, on the road, or even across a network.<p>

<p>

PowerPoint's has templates that help you figure out what to say, not just how to
make your presentation look. The AutoContent Wizard has been enhanced to
provide help by suggesting content for your presentation. Switch to the outline
view and the program suggests what points you should cover in each slide. This is
filtered by your answers to such questions as the type of audience and the intended
length of the presentation. <p>

<p>

The new Answer Wizard (an Office for Windows 95 feature) lets you query the
program in your own words, then the help system figures out what you're having
problems with. You can choose from two types of detailed help: text or graphical.
PowerPoint also lets you open more than one view of a presentation, which is a big
help when working on larger presentations.  <p>

<p>

In addition to content help, PowerPoint has plenty of new features that improve
the look of your presentations. Multimedia support is much enhanced with the
ability to add video files and sounds directly to slides. PowerPoint comes with a CD
containing a collection of sound and video clips and photographs. <p>

<p>

Both Freelance and PowerPoint are powerful programs that can help you with all
of your presentation needs. <b><p>

<h3><b>Buying A Scanner? What You Need To Know</h3></b>
<p>
<hr>
It was only a few years ago that scanners were expensive, hard-to-use specialty items for business,
but the march of technology has changed all of that and now, Home computer owners are lining up
for the devices, which contain a chip that reads photos, drawings, type and almost any other
two-dimensional and sometimes three-dimensional object and then converts the image into digital
data a computer can use. Scanning an image into the computer takes anywhere from a few seconds
for a snapshot-sized, low-resolution black-and-white line drawing to 15 minutes or more for a
detailed, 8 "-by-14"-inch color photo.<p>

<p>

Inserting photos into letters, greeting cards and newsletters barely scratches the surface of ways you
can use a scanner. How about creating artwork composites or collages? Are you tempted to add that
recipe from the back of the pasta box to your computer cookbook? Instead of typing it, run it through
the scanner Of course, you'll need a good OCR - Optical Character Recognition- program to scan that
test. <p>

<p>

Scanners for PCS and the Macintosh come in three basic types: hand held, sheetfed and flatbed. Each
group includes color scanners, which reproduce color or black-and-white originals, and gray scale
scanners, which can copy any original, but only in black and white or shades of gray. <p>

<b><i>HAND HELD:</i></b> This is the least expensive choice.  You can buy a gray scale hand held scanner for as
little as $100; a color model costs only slightly more but it requires a steady hand. You slowly, very
slowly, move the scanner over the art or type you want to copy. If you move too quickly or your hand
is unsteady, you can lose data or wind up with an imperfect image. <p>

<p>

Hand held scanners work best when you're copying small originals or narrow blocks of text. Scanning
large objects is tricky because most hand held models can't exceed a 4-inch-wide area; to do a wider
job, you must copy one 4-inch section at a time. Most handhelds include software that lets you stitch
together two or more scans to produce a full-sized image.<p>

<p>

<i><b>SHEETFED:</b></i> You don't have to worry about jittery hands when you use a sheetfed scanner. Simply
feed originals one at a time into a motor-driven slot that pulls them through the machine, much like a
fax. These higher-priced devicessold in stores for $250 to $400 also let you scan in an 8-by-10-inch
photo or a letter-sized page in one shot. But you can't scan in 3-D objects, and if you want to scan a
page from a book, you'll have to tear it out first.<p>

<p>

<i><b>FLATBED:</b></i> A flatbed scanner is the most versatile and, typically, the most expensive, with prices
starting at around $450 in stores. A flatbed resembles a small photocopier: You lift the cover and
place your original on a glass plate. Flatbeds can scan 2-D originals sometimes as large as 8 1/2 x by
17 inches in a single pass. They can also handle 3-D objects up to about 14-inch thick such as loose
change or a watch. By adding a document feeder ($100 to $350), you can automatically scan several
pages typically, about 50 sheetsat once. This is a joy if you work at home with many forms of the same
size. Transparency modules ($350 to $500) help you organize your photo collection by letting you scan
in slides or negatives as large as 8 by 10 inches, but they do a poor job with 35millimeter slides and
negatives because the images are too small for the scanners to pick up sufficient detail.
(Photographers or artists who plan to scan a lot of slides or negatives should consider a film scanner.
These specialized devices can cost as much as $18,000, but some simpler units, such as the Nikon
CoolScan and the Tamron Fotovix III, are priced around $1,000.) <p>

<p>

<i><b>FEATURE PRESENTATIONS</b></i><p>

<p>

Once you decide which type of scanner to buy, your next mission is to figure out which features you
need. Consider the following, all of which will affect the quality of your images.<p>

<p>

<i><b>GRAYSCALE AND COLOR</b></i>. If you choose a grayscale scanner, make sure it handles 256 shades of
gray. Some of the less expensive models can scan only 16 or 64 shades, which will limit the degree of
detail in your images.<p>

<p>

If you choose color, look for a 24-bit scanner, which works with 16.7 million colors and can
realistically capture continuous-tone originals such as color photos. Less expensive 8-bit color
handheld scanners offer only 256 colors; their scans look flat, somewhat like poster art. A 16-bit
scanner offers 65,000 colors, still nowhere near the standards of 24-bit units. Don't let anyone talk
you into buying a 30- or 36-bit color flatbed scanner, which costs more; the extra bits are useless
unless you plan to use the scanner professionally (say, for preparing images to go to a printing press).<p>

<p>

<i><b>ONE-PASS VS. THREE-PASS.<p>

</b></i> For a scanner to recognize color, images it must pass through the unit's red, green and blue filters. If
you're shopping for a color flatbed scanner, you may notice that the display cards at the store for
some models proclaim that the scanner makes three separate passes (one for each primary color)
over an object, while other models say they do everything in a single pass. Which offers higher-quality
scans? There's no significant difference.<p>

<p>

<i><b>RESOLUTION. </b></i>This refers to the level of detail a scanner captures, and it's one of the most
important measures of a unit's quality; the higher the number of dots per inch (dpi), the better the
machine. But the numbers can be deceiving because there are two measures of resolution: optical and
interpolated. <p>

 <p>

Optical, or hardware, resolution is the truer measure of how much detail a scanner can reproduce.
Look for a grayscale scanner with an optical resolution of at least 300 by 300 dpi. If you're buying a
color scanner, choose one with a minimum optical resolution of 400 by 400 dpi or even 300 by 600 dpi.
Interpolated, or software, resolution boosts the numbers as high as 4,800 dpi. When it works well,
interpolation significantly sharpens an image, but in many cases it won't appreciably improve an
image's overall quality.<p>

<p>

<i><b>SOFTWARE. </b></i>Most scanners come with all the basic software necessary to copy originals into a
computer, and they are often packaged with more advanced programs as well. If you'll be scanning
text most of the time, choose a scanner that comes with optical character recognition (OCR) software.
When you scan  in a page of type, the scanner treats it as a graphic image until you run the OCR
program, which translates the image into words that you can then edit in your word processor,
spreadsheet or database. Some popular OCR packages include Caere's OmniPage Direct, Calera's
WordScan and Xerox's TextBridge. Presto also makes a very nice one that can be downloaded from
the web.<p>

<p>

If you plan to work mostly with photos or illustrations, look for a scanner that includes image editing
software such as Adobe's Photoshop or Micrografx's Picture Publisher. These programs are the
computer equivalent of a drawing board, darkroom and retouching stand they allow you to edit or
enhance artwork right on the screen.<p>

<p>

<i><b>SPEED:</b></i> Typically, the more expensive the scanner, the faster it works. But in most cases the
difference per scan is only a few seconds, so unless you plan to handle a bunch of high-resolution
prints or photographs, you won't save much time. <p>

<p>

<b><i>TWAIN:</i></b> Be sure to choose a scanner that is TWAIN compatible. TWAIN which, believe it or not,
stands for Technology Without An Interesting Name, is a hardware and software standard that
allows you to scan an image directly into your word processing or desktop publishing file.  But more
important, TWAIN simplifies scanner software installation on a PC.<p>

<p>

Most scanners attach to computers through a Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) port. SCSI is
built into most Macs, so you simply plug the scanner into the computer, pop in the included diskette
and click on the Setup folder. Unfortunately, most PCs don't include an SCSI port, so you have to
install a separate SCSI board. The good news is that the board is usually sold with the scanner and is
easy to set up. Some handheld and sheetfed scanners conveniently connect to your computer's
parallel port, just like a printer.<p>

<p>

Scanners can be very useful tools for adding your company's logo to a brochure you are desigining and
they are great for scanning in graphics for use on the world wide web.<p>

<h2><i><center>Importing Text Into Your DTP Program</h2>
</center>
<p>

<center></i>By Staff Writers</center>
<p>

<p>

It seems so simple a task. You're going to bring a file from your word processor program into a page
layout program. All you need to do is access the import text command, select the file you want, and
presto, everything falls into place. <p>

<p>

If you've ever tried this before, then you know that things don't always work out so easily. You've
probably found that importing text into your desktop publishing (DTP) program doesn't go as
smoothly as you'd like, even if the source is a perfectly formatted document from a word processor
that there is a filter for.<p>

<p>

 Typically, word processors support the same kinds of formatting--for fonts, paragraph alignment, and
tab positions--as DTP programs do. Your DTP package's import filter takes this information, in
addition to the text, and converts it into its own native format. The trick to getting text into the shape
you want is knowing what your program's import filter can or cannot do.<p>

<p>

Depending on your DTP package, the import filter may convert only some aspects of the original file,
leaving out most or all of the formatting information. The more sophisticated import filters (such as
those found in PageMaker and other professional-level DTP programs) not only bring across all
formatting attributes, they also let you select which attributes to ignore. <p>

<p>

For example, the original text may be formatted as left justified, 12-point, bold Times New Roman,
but you want centered, 24-point Century SchoolBook displayed. Reformatting the text is easier if you
configure the program to ignore certain aspects of the original formatting simply by modifying the
default text settings in your DTP package.<p>

<p>

Most page layout programs come with import filters for files generated by a variety of word
processors. Although your program might include a filter for WordPerfect files, you may find that it
only supports files created in version 5.2 or lower, not 6.1, the current release. So what do you do
when the import filter doesn't support a particular file format? The best method is to save a word
processing document in Rich Text Format (RTF), which is not only supported by all DTP import
filters but also retains all formatting information.<p>

<p>

 Of course, there's the old standby of using the clipboard in Windows and the Macintosh or the OS/2
Presentation Manager. You simply start both the word processor and the DTP program, mark and
copy the text in the word processor, then paste it in the layout program. In most cases, however, the
page layout program will copy the text without any formatting attributes, so it's best to use this
method only when you're adding small chunks of text or as a last resort.<p>

<p>

Though ASCII text is always the safest route, since it's supported by all DTP programs regardless of
platform, you'll have to do a lot of housecleaning before actually formatting the document to your
specifications. <p>

<p>

For example, the import text command often eliminates carriage returns in ASCII files. That's
because some word processors save text files with carriage returns at the end of each line, not just at
the end of each<p>

paragraph. In other words, when you bring the text into your layout, you'll find that your document
has been converted into one huge paragraph.<p>

<p>

So what's the solution to this madness? In a word, styles. These are the attributes you apply to blocks
of text, and they'll save you lots of work. You can, for example, create a style that specifies a Times
Roman font and left justified paragraph alignment.<p>

<p>

 Most DTP packages allow you to create styles that can contain as much or as little formatting
information as you like, so you can create styles specifically for headlines, subheads, captions, and so
forth. After importing the document, simply select a block of text, apply the appropriate style, and
everything is instantly formatted. In this case, it really is that simple.<p>

<p>

The top word processors, Microsoft Word, WordPerfect, and AmiPro, also let you create styles, and
some DTP import filters retain all the preset information from these programs. If you can get this
combination, then you're really in luck.<p>

<p>

It's important to remember that your DTP program will not necessarily import any file from a word
processing program. But if you use a format that can be transferred and specify style attributes
beforehand, you'll be able to handle text with a minimum of fuss.<p>

<h3>Do I Really Need a Color Printer? </h3><p>
<h4>By: T. Ardito</h4><p>

<hr>
<p>

At one time, color printers were an expensive luxury limited to those professional graphic studios
and cost-is-no-object corporate high rollers. But times have changed. Now, 12 year old kids are
cranking out high quality graphics on a $400 color inkjet printer they bought with their paper
route money.<p>

One printer that I particularily like is the Epson Stylus Color Pro. For  about $600, it's a great
printer. Color laser printers are still steep at roughly $6,000, but they are worth considering if
your business demands higher-quality output, or if you're feeling particularly rich.<p>

Why is color important? Because on documents for your business, club, group or whatever, color
sells. Color sells because it catches a reader's eye. Color sells because it projects an image of
quality that's unattainable with black and white. Color sells because you can use it to manipulate a
reader's emotional response.<p>

Most important, color sells because you can add selective emphasis to your documents, making it
easy for your readers to separate the important messages from the merely supportive filler you
threw in. <p>

Though there are many reasons why color works, it can just as easily ruin and obscure your
message instead of enhance it. Used improperly, color can add clutter,  distract your readers, and
sends out the wrong message. <p>

Just as using too many type faces and tons of graphics can make your document look bad, colors
that are either overused or improperly used can do the same thing. <p>

Before you run off and start writing the great American newsletter in nulti-color hues remember
that your color printer is not a color duplicator. Don't expect to print hundreds of copies of your
four-color newsletter on it. Office color printers are perfect for proofing projects that you will
send to a service bureau and commercial printer for cost effective duplication.<p>

The relatively slow speeds and high costs of supplies for most office printers make them 
unsuitable for making more than a dozen copies. Since the cost of ink-jet supplies depends on the
amount of ink coverage, documents with color backgrounds can cost 25 to 50 cents a copy, plus
the cost of the special papers many printers need to produce the best possible quality.<p>

Here are five ways that you can best use color in your documents.<p>

<b>Use Color Wisely:</b> Color works best when it's concentrated in a few large areas on a
page rather than scattered throughout a document. A few words printed in reverse type out of a
color background provide far greater impact than smaller areas of color placed randomly.<p>

<b> Beware of Backgrounds:</b> People can easily read black text against a white background.
Any time you move away from black against white, you risk sacrificing legibility. Color
backgrounds may jazz up a page and attract immediate attention, but they often make it more
difficult to read the text. <p>

Color type against screened or color backgrounds reduces readability even more.<p>

<b>Color Headlines with Care:</b> Although brightly colored headlines attract a reader's
attention, they often grab all the attention, causing people to skip over the adjacent text. In
addition, headlines set in color often lack impact because they don't form enough contrast with
color used elsewhere on the page, such as a color nameplate. The color headlines and department
heads become associated with the nameplate rather than standing apart. This doesn't mean you
should never use color headlines -- just make sure that the color you use doesn't detract from the
rest of the page.<p>

<p>

<b>Use Selective Emphasis:</b> One of the most effective ways to highlight documents is to set
a few key
paragraphs against a yellow background. This technique is easily done in any word processing
program. When an important paragraph is boxed, it looks parenthetical. When the paragraph
appears
against a yellow background, however, the color draws a reader's eye straight to it. Use this
technique
with restraint, however. For maximum impact, restrict yourself to one paragraph per page. <p>

<b>Don't Live by Color Alone:</b> Using color as the sole design tool often weakens, rather
than
reinforces, a message, especially when text is concerned. Usually, the motivation to use color is to
attract attention or make the words easier to read. But words set in color, especially small serif
text
or italics, are often harder to read than the same text set in black.<p>

If you're going to set such text as subheads or a sidebar (an article within an article) in a second
color, choose a bold typeface, a sans serif face, or a larger type size -- or a combination of all
three.<p>

<b>Reasons to Buy a Color Printer</b><p>

* Prepare color letterhead and envelopes on the fly by adding your company logo in color to the
header or footer of each page.<p>

* Add emphasis to proposals and reports by producing pie and bar charts, line graphs, and
organization outlines in color. <p>

* Bring proposals, reports, and fliers to life by reproducing photographs in color rather than black
and white. Even if the resolution isn't as sharp as you'd get with black and white, color
photographs
have more impact. <p>

* Add selective emphasis to important paragraphs within a sales letter by placing them against a
yellow background. You can do this easily with any Macintosh or Windows word processing
program
using the Borders, Backgrounds, or Fill feature. <p>

* Sign your business letters and faxes by inserting a scanned image of your signature that will
print
in blue. <p>

* Create color handouts to reinforce your presentations. You may be surprised at the difference
color
handouts have in strengthening the acceptance of your ideas. <p>

* Add your logo in color to address labels, business cards, and name tags. <p>

* Create attention-getting announcements, invitations, and press releases by setting headlines or
the
recipient's name in color. <p>

* Get a better idea of how projects that you'll send to a print shop for imaging and mass
duplication
will look by preparing color proofs in your office. This way, you'll note and correct your mistakes
for free. <p>

* Clarify complex information on maps and instruction sheets by showing routes and procedures
in
color. <p>

<h2>UnInstaller 3</h2>
<h4><i>Make your computer a lean, mean fighting machine!</i></h4>
<p>

<h4>By Martin P. Waterman</h4>
<p>
<hr>
Being charged with the task of reviewing software does have its disadvantages one of which is a
computer that quickly becomes cluttered with useless files even when the software has been deleted. 
Unfortunately, deleting programs, unless they come with their own uninstall utility, only partially
remove the program from your system.  The result is that eventually your hard disk space disappears,
your system slows and in some cases there can be error messages and even  conflicts.  <p>

<p>

Tracking down the culprits is not only time consuming, it is a major headache renaming and backing
up files until you find the one responsible for your problems.<p>

  <p>

I grew tired of having to reformat my hard drives about every six months so I began my quest for a
program that would easily and painlessly allow me to keep my computer fit and trim.  My choice,
after flirting with some others, was UnInstaller 3. This third incarnation of the software is not
perfect but it has earned the distinction of being a full time resident on my hard drive.  <p>

<p>

I was disappointed that the sofware which was "guaranteed to run under Windows 95" did not.  A
friend had similar problems that the program would often freeze in its tracks.  However,  the new 32
bit Windows 95 version (which also works under 3.1) will be available to everyone by the time this
hits the press. <i>(Editor's Note -the 32 bit version is available as of 1/20/96)</i><p>

<p>

<b>Search and Destroy</b><p>

<p>

UnInstaller 3 three represents a major revision of the software that first appeared in 1992.  In 1994
UnInstaller 2 became the best selling software in the U.S.  Version 3 has some powerful features that
differentiate it from other uninstall programs and it predecessors.<p>

<p>

One of the new features is SmartLinks which gathers information about your system and buids a
table of all file interdependencies.  This is importantant because these interdependencies are created
when Windows appliations share system files (dynamic link libraries. Visual Basic Extensions,
drivers, etc.)  When the time comes to deep six a program it can be almost impossible to determine
which are shared files and which are not.<p>

<p>

Deleting the wrong file can have dire consequences which include rendering other applications
useless. Leaving these unessessary files on your hard drive takes up space and slows your system.<p>

SmartLinks goes to your Windows directory and looks for .DLLs even if they do not have the .DLL
extension. Next, Uninstaller reads each executable<p>

file to learn which program and system files are related.    Using this information, UnInstaller is able
to determine which files can safely be deleted.  SmartLinks makses sure that all files necessary for
the move are gathered in one bundle and also notifies the Windows systems files of the change of
address.  <p>

<p>

The Transport feature reflects the growth in mobile computing and the need to move entire
programs.  With this utility you can transport application to another drive, a laptop or another
computer without the hassles of having to reinstall it.	 <p>

	<p>

Another useful feature is Windows Cleanup.  This part of the program can remove 19 different types
of files on your system such drivers that are not in use, fonts, help files, lost clusters, MIDI files,
Screen Savers and Setup files.  There is also a built in viewer that allows you to look at certain files
such as clipart to see if you want to delete it. <p>

<p>

One of the fears concerning these types of programs is that you will delete important information
such as program files or files necessary to run your system.  UnInstaller has many safeguards and
queries you before you make your decision.  If you have the backup option on you can restore your
deleted application should you become too delete happy and get carried away. Uninstaller also allows
you to archive applications that are seldom used.<p>

<p>

UnInstaller is an intuitive prograam and is very easy to master.  It does come with a large manual
which has one of the best explanations of Windows and how it works but also comes with a quick
reference card describing how to quickly use the eight most important keys.<p>

	<p>

There are many players in the uninstall market and UnInstaller is at the high end with a SRP of
about $79.00.  However, the product is backed by a 30 day unconditional guarantee and there is
unlimited free technical support. UnInstaller is also fully compatable with third pary shell programs
such as Norton Desktop, PCTools Desktop and Dashboard.  There is also a version specifically for
networks.<p>

<p>

UnInstaller comes with its own unistaller should you ever want to remove it from your system.  The
program only needs 4.5 MB of disk space and will run on a Windows 3.1 or higher system with a
minimum of 4 MB of RAM.  Just an observation but why does it seem that the only the programs you
want to keep allow you to unistall them while those you really want to get rid of do not? MicroHelp

<h3>McAfee Working On Boot Sector Anti-Virus Technology</h3>
<p>
<hr>
McAfee, the international anti-virus software house, has revealed it is working on a package called BootShield, an anti-virus
package for PCs that is capable of preventing boot sector virus infections. The package, which will ship at the end of this
month worldwide, would be a major breakthrough as boot sector viruses have been the bane of PC users for several years.<p>

<p>

Tom Spence, anti-virus product development manager with McAfee, claims that, until now, traditional anti-virus applications
have been unable to prevent boot sector virus infections. Also, although boot sector viruses account for only six percent of
the total population of 7,000 known computer viruses, they account for more than 70 percent of reported virus infections,
the company claims.<p>

<p>

"Anti-virus researchers have struggled for years to develop a preventative solution for the boot virus problem," Spence said,
adding that the challenge that the industry faced was that boot virus programs infect PCs during their start up sequences --
before the operating system can load the anti-virus software modules. "In order to circumvent the infection process of boot
viruses, we needed to use the virus writers' own techniques against them when we created Bootshield," he claimed.<p>

<p>

According to McAfee, most boot virus infections occur when users attempt to reboot their system, for whatever reason, while
there is a floppy disk in the floppy drive. Even though the disk may not be a bootable one with COMMAND.COM or similar
on it, the floppy -- if infected -- can still infect the PC, even if the disk is then removed and a standard hard disk boot cycle
is commenced.<p>

<p>

In use, Bootshield masks the boot sector from potential viruses. When Bootshield is installed on a PC, it scans the complete
system to check it is virus free. Then, Bootshield copies itself into the boot sector and relocates the system's boot sector
information to a hidden and secure area of the disk drive. As the PC is booted up, so Bootshield is engaged at first disk seek
and the utility "points" the hard disk head to the hidden area of the disk for the normal boot up information.<p>

<p>

If a virus attempts to modify the boot sector, Bootshield will halt system operations and display a dialog box to provide
several administrator-defined instructions, including an option to delete the virus. Bootshield is also billed as providing
real-time monitoring of the master book records, partition tables, and system interrupt vectors.<p>

<p>

One useful feature of Bootshield is a utility called ImageStor. This utility maintains a real-time mirrored backup of the entire
hard drive, and is accessible in cases of hard disk failure. The ImageStor facility was developed by Mountain Technology.<p>

<h3>Wang, Microsoft Giving Away Imaging Software For Win95</h3>
<p>
<hr>
Wang Laboratories Inc.  and Microsoft  are giving out free imaging software for Microsoft's
Windows 95 operating system on the Web and three commercial online services.<p>

<p>

The imaging software, developed by Wang for Windows 95, is available at both Wang and
Microsoft Web sites, http://www.wang.com and http://www.microsoft. com/windows
respectively. Subscribers to CompuServe, America Online, and The Microsoft Network can also
download it at no charge.<p>

<p>

It will be on the Microsoft Developer Network CD due to be issued in April, and later will be
incorporated in future versions of Windows, officials said.<p>

<p>

The software, which includes a 32-bit Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) interface to simplify
the task of creating image-enabled applications, is available in English, Dutch, French, German,
Italian, Japanese, and Spanish.<p>

<p>

It makes it possible to turn scanned and faxed documents into electronic images and to handle
image documents and  view faxes through the in box in Microsoft's Exchange software.<p>

<p>

Wang and Microsoft announced an imaging alliance last April. That deal settled a 21-month
patent fight over Wang object-management technology used in Microsoft's OLE, and also gave
Microsoft a 10-percent stake in Wang when it acquired $90 million worth of convertible preferred
stock. Analysts have called the alliance with Microsoft a key step in Wang's strategy, which relies
heavily on imaging technology as a new cornerstone of the former minicomputer maker's business.<p>

<p>

Windows 95, launched with much hoopla last summer, has not quite lived up to expectations,
with computer buyers showing some hesitation to upgrade right away. A few applications
software companies, such as Ottawa-based Corel Corp., have blamed disappointing earnings on
the fact that new software designed exclusively for Windows 95 has not yet sold as well as they
had hoped.<p>

<b><h3>Consistancy In Your Documents Can Make Your Life Easier</b> </h3>
<p>
<hr>
I know it is sometimes hard to believe, but some of the features available in software packages aredesigned to make your
life easier, and they actually do the job. You just have to know what they are and learn how to use them to your
advantage. A case in point is styles. They're in just about every word processor and page layout program. But they're
rarely used to their fullest extent. This is a shame because styles can make major contributions to the quality of your
documents and efficiency of your work.<p>

<p>

So what are styles? When you look under the Styles menu in your program tool bar or menu, you'll find options that will
allow you to set a certain style you want to a paragraph or paragraphs within your document. This includes such things
as typeface, type size, line spacing, alignment, and so on -- with just a click or two of your mouse. And they eliminate the
need to open menus and dialog boxes every time you want to make a change.<p>

<p>

Let's say you've just finished a 25-page business proposal and decide that instead of indenting the first line of each
paragraph, you'd rather put a line space between them. If you didn't use styles, you'd have to go through every paragraph
and manually eliminate the first-line indent and add the space. Tiring, to say the least. If, however, you had built the
first-line indent into your body copy style, all you would have to do is edit the style and each paragraph would be
instantly reformatted.<p>

<p>

There are two types of styles: character level and paragraph level. Character-level styles determine the appearance of
individual words, including such formatting attributes as typeface, type size, type style, letter spacing, and color.
Paragraph-level styles include alignment, indenting, line spacing, and hyphenation.<p>

<p>

In software, as in life, you have to create your own styles. But take my word for it: It's much easier to do it in your
software. Basically, there are two ways to create styles. Please remember that your word processor or page layout
progam may be slightly different in the commands, but the same generic steps should lead you to set your styles.<p>

<p>

You can format by example, which involves creating the style after you've formatted the text. Although software differs
slightly, three basic steps are involved: First, apply the desired formatting attributes to a selection of text; second,
highlight the text; and third, select Define Styles, choose New, enter a name that explains the intended use of the style,
and save it. The other method, creating a style from scratch, is similar to formatting by example. But you name the style
first, then choose your desired formatting attributes before you enter or import the text.<p>

<p>

Although styles are often thought of as document specific, things become more interesting when you share styles among
documents. Not only does this eliminate the need to reinvent the wheel each time you begin a new project, it also
guarantees that your documents speak with a common voice.<p>

<p>

To share styles, you select Define Styles, then New, then Copy. Next, select the document containing the styles you want
to copy. Usually, a prompt will warn you that existing styles with the same names will be overwritten with the imported
information.<p>

<p>

Each element of a page should be accompanied by a clearly identified style. There are more opportunities than you might
be aware of. Even a simple proposal is likely to require at least a dozen different styles, including primary and secondary
headlines, bulleted or numbered lists, headers and footers (information at the top and bottom of each page, such as the
name of your proposal and/or page number), and titles (for charts, graphs, and tables). If you haven't already defined
these styles, you'll easily tire of constantly making such individual changes to your documents. <p>

<p>

Here are five tips for maximizing your use of styles.<p>

<p>

1. Use meaningful names. The names for your styles should be so clear that you instinctively choose the right one. This
may seem obvious, but just wait until you get hooked on styles and find yourself having to decide between "Heading 1,"
"Head1," and "NewHeading."<p>

<p>

2. List styles in order of use. Most programs arrange styles alphanumerically in the Style menu. "Normal" is thus way
down the list. Rename your normal style "Body copy" to bring it near the top of the list, or add an "a" or a "1" before it.<p>

<p>

3. Avoid unnecessary text highlighting. In most cases, you don't have to highlight the entire paragraph to apply a style.
Simply place the text insertion point anywhere inside the paragraph and apply the style. <p>

<p>

4. Automate your styles. Many programs allow you to set up publication styles so that a new style will be automatically
applied at the end of the paragraph you're working on (after you press the Enter or Return key). For example, you can
automatically follow subheads with a Nonindented Body Copy style for the first paragraph, followed by an Indented
Body Copy style for the remaining paragraphs. This method eliminates the need to apply two out of three styles.<p>

<p>

5. Use styles to create run-ins. Software with character-level styles makes it easy to create run-ins, in which the first
phrase or sentence in a paragraph is set in a contrasting typeface. Mastering styles is an easy way to improve
productivity and the quality of your product. Once you become comfortable using keyboard shortcuts to apply styles or
automate them so that one follows another without your intervention, you'll wonder how you ever got along without
them.<p>

<b><h3>GENEALOGICAL TIPS<b></h3>
By:  Anthony Accetta<p>
<hr>
OK, you've got the desire to publish a family newsletter but you want to find out more about your clan and it's roots.
Besides talking to other family members and looking through old family records where can you go.<p>

<p>

Geneology can be a slow and steady process of researching files and ecords in old libraries, county clerks offices and
archives. One spot I would recommend is the Mormon Temple nearest you - most sites have a Stake Library that will
allow you access to records from around the world. <p>

<p>

What about the Internet - what can it do for me you ask? Well, most genealogical records aren't available electronically
(yet). But online you can find genealogy libraries and associations in your area, get tips on locating certain kinds of
records (such as immigration papers), and share your latest finds with other family-tree trackers.<p>

<p>

Cyberspace is a great place to find others who are doing family research. Some users have checked into an online
service's forum and logged off with seven or eight generations of information. Of course, it's not always that easy. In
most cases progress is made the old-fashioned way; You earn it.<p>

<h3>Microsoft Intros Wordperfect Transition Plan</h3>
<p>
<hr>
With Wordperfect on the sale block, Microsoft Corp. has launched a push to get Wordperfect users to switch to
Microsoft Word. The transition program includes a course by training company Executrain called "Microsoft Word for
Windows 95 for Wordperfect Users." Temporary staffing company Manpower Inc., is also offering a training program.
It combines self-paced learning with on-site instruction by Manpower software trainers.<p>

<p>

Microsoft has even established a page on the World Wide Web to help Wordperfect users make the switch. It's at
http://www.microsoft.com/switch and will be online by February 15, 1996. Microsoft said the site will include
information on topics like file and macro conversions, built-in Wordperfect Help features and product support services.<p>

<p>

Microsoft said its Product Support Services division offers conversion support to accounts that switch 2,000 or more
desktops from one or more competitive applications, like Wordperfect, to Microsoft Word, Excel or Office.<p>

<p>

The large companies even get a designated Office Conversion Manager support professional to help users make the
switch. You get 90 days of help with planning, installation and implementation of Microsoft Office products. More
information about the support program is also available on Microsoft's home page at http://www.microsoft.com/support
.<p>

<p>

Microsoft has also instituted phone support lines for Wordperfect switchers. The call is not free, but you can get help
with the application transition from Microsoft support professionals at no cost other than the phone call.<p>

<p>

Microsoft has published a Wordperfect 5.x and 6.x supplemental kit that includes five TrueType fonts the company said
will improve the switch to Word for Windows 95. You get five fonts and two Wordperfect templates with toolbars,
macros, styles and keyboard shortcuts. The kit is downloadable from http://www.microsoft.com/msword under the
listing "free stuff."<p>

<p>

You can also get Wordperfect file converters on the Microsoft home page that move documents created with
Wordperfect 5.x and 6.x to Microsoft Word for Windows 95. Word has built-in online help that lets its users select a
Wordperfect command and learn how to use the equivalent command in Word.If you make the switch from another word
processing program to Word for Windows 95 or upgrade from a previous version of Word it will cost about $129. For
first time users Microsoft Word for Windows 95 carries a price tag of about $339.<p>

<p>

Microsoft Word is one of the applications in Microsoft Office. The Standard  edition of Office, with a street price of
about $499, includes Word, spreadsheet program Excel, Powerpoint presentation graphics and Schedule+, a scheduling
a program. The Professional Edition includes all of those plus the database application Access. The Pro version sells for
just under $600.<p>

<p>

I for one will wait out the sale of WordPerfect and see what develops with the new owners before making the switch to
Word for Windows. <b>Corel </b>has done wonders with some of the other products they have purchased, such
as Ventura, and I think they will do justice to Word perfect as well.<b><p>

Internet/ISDN   Synergy:</b> "ISDN is a sleeping giant that's waking up," says the manager of BellSouth's ISDN business
unit, and industry observers are predicting that the integrated services digital network might actually begin generating
profits for telcos over the next couple of years.  "ISDN will really take off when phone companies start selling ISDN and
Internet access together," says a telecommunications strategist for Furman Selz Inc.  "The average voice call is five
minutes, but people stay online for hours.  The phone companies see this as adding up to $50 to $80 a month, per ISDN
customer, in incremental revenue."  (Investor's Business Daily 26 Dec 95 A8)<p>

<p>

<b>Microsoft Does an About-face on Their Internet Strategy:</b> The Microsoft Network has abandoned its original
strategy to keep its service proprietary, available only to Windows 95 users; earlier this month chairman Bill Gates
announced that next year, MSN would be available to all 11 million or so users of the Internet.  "Most of the online
services are already looking at the Internet the way we are," says MSN's marketing director, but "for the currently
successful and larger online services, it's harder for them to make the jump."  The change in strategy leaves Microsoft
with the task of developing new online revenue sources, which probably will depend on charging fees for "exclusive"
content.  "Content is the ultimate business," says Gates.  (Business Week 25 Dec-1 Jan 96 p41)<p>

Companies Bypass ad Agencies in Web Stampede:</b> As the Web's population swells to 13.8 million by 1996,
Forrester Research points out that the bigger numbers aren't translating to bigger income for advertising agencies. 
Fifty-one percent of brand managers who'd set up a Web site said they implemented their strategies without the help of
an ad agency.  (Investor's Business Daily 27 Dec 95 A6)  Stepping in to fill the gap are an increasing number of start-up
cyberagencies, which have managed to usurp the advisory and implementation role traditionally played by the ad agency
with regard to conventional media.  Full-service agencies say they'll get their chance when the client seeks to integrate its
Web site into its mainstream marketing activities:  "When you marry the technical expertise with the knowledge of and
essence of the brand, that's when the magic is going to happen," says an advertising VP.  (Wall Street Journal 27 Dec 95
p17)<p>

<p>

<b>Internet Overload: </b>Andrew Seybold, editor of "Outlook on Communications and Computing," sees increasing gridlock
on the Internet:  "I believe the Internet network will crash and burn, and from it will emerge the information highway,
though I don't know what the access route will be...  I used to be able to get to an Internet site, grab what I wanted and be
off in five minutes.  It now takes a half-hour.  Forwarding mail, which used to take 10 minutes, now takes six hours. 
People are pushing more video and graphic material over the Internet.  This requires high bandwidth, and there's a finite
amount of bandwidth on any network.  I believe the Internet is very close to where the phone companies are on Mother's
Day.  They can just barely tolerate the traffic."  (Investor's Business Daily 28 Dec 95 A8)<p>

<b>Boston College Chosen for Cable Modem Trial:</b> Continental Cablevision is testing out its lightning-fast cable
modems in more than 6,600 dorm rooms, 2,500 classrooms and 400 offices on the campus of Boston College.  So far,
the results show that faster is better -- usage has shot up since the modems were installed.  One convert explains it this
way:  "Not dialing, always connected, and it's astronomically faster." Students' e-mail now includes photos, and
student-designed Web sites are commonplace. Meanwhile, Forrester Research predicts that by the year 2000, there will
be seven million cable modem customers, yielding $1.3 billion in new revenues for the cable industry.  (Wall Street

<b>Internet Hangover?:</b> A senior VP at International Data Corp. predicts widespread consumer disillusion with the
Internet:  "We also believe the Internet and World Wide Web phenomenon will go from an intoxication stage to a
hangover stage during the next two years.  About 20% of the large firms will jump off the Web because the consumer
demographics are not developing quickly enough.  But just as those 30 to 35 companies jump off, another 175 will hop
on.  The growth in online subscribers will continue to be very strong, but there will be underlying high turnover rates as
users who are underwhelmed by content on the Web cancel and turn on their TVS."  (Investor's Business Daily 10 Jan

<b>Oracle Plans to Ship First Internet PC in March: </b>Oracle Corp. is putting the finishing touches on its first Internet
PC, which it says will ship in March, and is working with Acorn Computer Group on a second version.  The new device
will meet the $500 price goal, but will come without a monitor.  Instead, consumers will use cables to hook it up to their
television sets or PCS.  The manufacturing cost, according to Oracle's VP of network computing, is under $200 -- $100
for four megabytes of RAM, $30 for an ARM 7500 microprocessor, and the rest for the keyboard, mouse and network
connections.  (Wall Street Journal 11 Jan 96 B2)<p>

Compu-Toys: </b>One of the widely awaited products debuting at the recent consumer electronics show was the new line of
brightly colored and over-sized computer attachments built for kids by Compaq Computer in league with Fisher-Price
Inc.  The first fruits of the partnership are a $150 Wonder Tools Cruiser -- a driving toy that steers a toddler through a
computer game -- and a $130 keyboard scaled to fit a small child's hands.  The team may hit it big this year -- shipments
of electronic learning toys are growing at about 28% a year, and sales of educational and reference software grew by
142% last year, according to IDC/Link Inc.  Not to be left out, Packard Bell expects to launch its family-oriented
add-ons, dubbed Packard Bell Interactive, and rumor has it IBM and Microsoft also are developing child-sized hardware
and software this year.  (Business Week 15 Jan 96 p38)<p>

<p>

<b>Cell Phone Rates on Their Way Down: </b>Cellular phone rates, which have remained high for years in the face of
enormous consumer growth, may finally be responding to competitive pressures and beginning to drop.  Subscriber
growth rates are slowing down, and wireless wars have ignited in New York, Chicago and Washington, DC.  Figures for
the largest 15 carriers in the U.S. show a 12% growth rate in 1995, down from 63% the previous year.  And the advent
of personal communications services may push prices down even further, possibly another 10% to 40% according to an
analyst at EDS Management Consulting Services.  (Wall Street Journal 11 Jan 96 B1)<p>

<p>

<b>Apple Loss Higher than Anticipated: </b>Although Apple had already projected losses for its fiscal first quarter, which
ended December 29th, the actual figure  for the loss turns out to be about twice what analysts had expected ($68
million), putting more pressure on Apple CEO Michael Spindler.  (New York Times 11 Jan 96 C1)<p>

<p>

<b>Pretty Good Phone Privacy, Too:</b> Now from the creator of PGP encryption software comes a new product for making
your phone calls more private.  Philip Zimmermann's PGPfone software scrambles phone calls made through a
computer modem using a complex algorithm called Blowfish, which rearranges the digital version of your voice
conversation and then decodes it at the other end.  The result is an intelligible -- though not high-quality -- totally private
conversation.   The URL is: &lt;http: //web.mit.edu/network/pgpfone/&gt;.  (Popular Science Jan 96 p43)<p>

<b>New Survey Lowers Internet User Estimates:</b> A new survey by New York-based Find/SVP pegs the number of U.S.
Internet users at 9.5 million, far below the findings of a disputed Nielsen Media Research survey a couple of months ago,
which had reported 24 million North American users.  The Find/SVP study also estimated the number of U.S. Web
users was about 7.5 million.  (Wall Street Journal 12 Jan 96 B2)  Meanwhile, a survey conducted by the Emerging
Technologies Research Group shows Internet users spending an average of 6.6 hours a week on the Net, time previously
spent watching TV, listening to the radio or making long-distance phone calls.  The average session was 68 minutes. 
Women are twice as likely as men to use the Internet exclusively for business.  (Tampa Tribune Jan 12 96 B&amp;F1)<p>

<b>Apple Workforce Cuts Ahead: </b>Analysts are predicting that Apple Computer will be cutting up to a fourth of its
workforce in an effort to recover from its recently posted losses of $68 million for the last quarter.  "It's very clear they
can't continue in the same vein because they are not making any money," says one investor. "They need to organize the
business so that they can make a profit."  The restructuring is widely viewed as CEO Michael Spindler's last chance to
turn things around. (Investor's Business Daily 12 Jan 96 A5)<p>

<p>

<b>Web Syntax, Explained for All: </b>Syndicated columnist Dave Barry says that "those weird string of letters that have
started showing up everywhere in newspaper stories, advertisements, TV shows, etc., the ones that look like
http//www/clamsucker.doo. wah"  are "code instructions to Dan Rather from his home planet."<p>

<b>Are IBM and Sears Abandoning Prodigy?:</b> Corporate spokespersons have declined comment on reports that IBM
and the Sears, Roebuck Co. are talking with investment bankers in order to devise a way to extricate themselves from
their ownership of Prodigy, the third-largest consumer online service after AOL and CompuServe. Prodigy's
marketplace value may have increased in recent months as a result of its aggressiveness in positioning itself as an
Internet access provider with some ownership of content.  (New York Times 16 Jan 96 C2)<p>

<p>

<b>Windows 95 Sales Raise Concerns:</b> Software companies that bet on phenomenal sales of Microsoft Windows 95 are
reporting disappointing financial results.  The problem is that fewer companies are switching over to the new operating
system than anticipated, instead waiting until they buy newer, more powerful computers better suited  to the Windows 95
environment.  "It is still the largest software product done in the industry to this point," says an analyst at Computer
Intelligence Infocorp.  "We're estimating that they've got something on the order of 17-million units out there already,
and that's not chicken feed." But "it's not becoming the corporate desktop, and that has some people worried."  (St.
Petersburg Times 15 Jan 96 p8)<p>

<p>

Internet Domain Policy: </b>Network Solutions Inc. (NSI), which issues Internet domain names to U.S. companies and
organizations, has a new domain-name registration policy which will "protect the ability of companies to extend their
corporate identity into the Internet."  The policy requires applicants to warrant that the requested name will not infringe
any intellectual property of any third party and will not be used for any lawful purpose.  &lt;http://www.shsl.com &gt; <p>

<b>Supreme Court Deadlocks 4-4 on Copyright Issue: </b>A U.S. Supreme Court  4-4 tied vote on a Lotus/Borland
copyright dispute leaves in place an appellate court ruling which said Lotus Development Corporation was not entitled
to copyright protection for a system of commands and menus which it had developed for the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet
program and which were copied by Borland for that company's Quattro Pro program.  The appellate court ruling said
that a command structure was not a "form of expression" (i.e., something that is copyrightable), but rather a "method of
operation" (i.e., something outside the scope of copyright law). (New York Times 17 Jan 96 C2)<p>

<p>

<b>An Exodus from the Commercial Services?:</b> Commercial online services are having a difficult time keeping
customers and differentiating themselves, as more savvy computer users switch over to small Internet access providers. 
"Most everything I find on the online services, I can find using an Internet service provider," says one customer who's
made the switch.  "For me, the need for an online service is diminishing."  "AOL is like the Internet on training wheels,"
says another, who feels he's "graduated."  In tandem with subscriber defection is the problem of content providers who
increasingly are setting up their own shops on the Web, bypassing the commercial services altogether.  The popularity of
the Web "turns the model of the online services industry upside down," says Scott Kurnit, the former No. 2 executive at
Prodigy, who's now running an Internet service for MCI and News Corp.  While the number of commercial service
subscribers has grown to about 12.5 million over the past decade (doubling in the past year), the number of World Wide
Web users increased eight-fold, to eight-million, in just the past year, according to International Data Corp.  (Wall Street
Journal 18 Jan 96 A6)<p>

<p>

<b>One Is Enough: </b>The number of people subscribing to more than one online service has dropped significantly since
1991 when almost a third of online users carried multiple subscriptions.  Now, 97% report they can do everything they
need to using a single service.  (Business Week 22 Jan 96 p8)<p>

<p>

<b>Apple to Eliminate 1,300 Jobs:</b> Apple Computer says it will be forced to lay off 1,300 employees, or 8% of its staff, as
a first step in restructuring its business.  The company plans to simplify its product line, focusing on high-end machines,
while allowing Mac clones to dominate the low-end market.  In addition, CEO Michael Spindler says Apple will
fundamentally change its business model, concentrating on its key products in education, business and home markets,
while pursuing expanded business alliances.  (Investor's Business Daily 18 Jan 96 A9)<p>

<p>

<b>Teacherless ClassRooms Considered:</b> Ontario's Community colleges, hunting for $120-million in savings for the next
academic year, are de-emphasizing the role of the teacher in the learning process.  A study prepared for the Colleges'
Council of Presidents  titled "Learning Centered Education" says educational institutions can cut teaching costs by using
CD-ROM courses and computer tutorials to deliver education using support staff rather than teachers to monitor
students' progress. (Ottawa Citizen 17 Jan 96 A4)<p>

<p>

<b>Wang's Imaging Software for Win 95</b>: Wang Laboratories has developed software that allows PCS to file, forward or
annotate faxed and scanned images in a standardized way.  The product development stems from a patent lawsuit
settlement reached last spring with Microsoft, under which Microsoft acquired a 10% stake in Wang.  The
image-handling capability will be incorporated into future versions of Windows 95.  (Wall Street Journal 17 Jan 96 B5)<p>

<b><p>

Apple for Sale:</b> Apple Computer is for sale, but no buyers have materialized yet. Reportedly, Sun Microsystems was in
discussions over a buy out as recently as two weeks ago, but backed off over Apple's price tag.  Others with whom
Apple CEO Michael Spindler has broached the subject include Hewlett-Packard, Motorola, Toshiba, Sony and IBM, but
so far, no company has been willing to meet Spindler's price.  (Wall Street Journal 19 Jan 96 B2)<p>

<p>

<b>IBM Drops OS/2-PowerPC Plans: </b>IBM has decided to abandon its three-year effort to create a version of its OS/2
operating software for the PowerPC chip.  A spokeswoman says, "Demand hasn't developed for it the way we thought it
would."  Instead, IBM will concentrate on developing OS/2 products for PCS that run on Intel chips. (Wall Street
Journal 26 Jan 96 B3)<p>

 <p>

<b>AOL Records Used to Solve Murder Case:</b> Fairfax County, Va. police recently obtained a search warrant for
electronic files relating to participants in an American Online chat room in an effort to solve a murder in New Jersey. 
The victim had met his alleged assailant through a "men for men" chat room, and investigators say several other chat
room participants helped in disposing of the body.  One of them, a 24-year-old woman, is now charged with tampering
with the evidence. An AOL spokeswoman said that it is the company's policy to comply with subpoenas, and that
although it does not keep records from chat rooms, it does keep records of e-mail for five days before they are purged. 
"We certainly respect and abide by our customers' right to privacy, but we are also going to follow the law.  We have 4.5
million customers -- that's the size of a city.  When we have some problems, we have to deal with it responsibly." (St.
Petersburg Times 28 Jan 96)<p>

<p>

<b>U.S. Postal Service Plans Digital Services:</b> Between 1988 and 1994, the U.S. Postal Service's market share of mail
delivery dropped from 77% to 62%, while market share for express delivery services  dropped from 4% to 2%, and
market share for electronic alternatives increased from 19% to 36%.  To survive and prosper in the information age, the
Postal Service now has aggressive new plans for providing digital services, including a hybrid service (carrying both
e-mail and paper mail), electronic shopping kiosks, and certified electronic mail. Postal executive Richard Rothwell
says:  "In the future, when you buy cc:Mail, the box will say, 'Postal Electronic Commerce Services-ready.' When you
click on an icon, it will invoke options such as electronic postmark, certificate, return receipt and so forth."  Gene Del
Polito of the<p>

Advertising Mail Marketing Association objects to the Postal Service's plans, saying:  "Anyone that competes with the
Postal Service is at an enormous disadvantage.  They don't pay taxes, they are not subject to antitrust laws, and so forth." 
(Computerworld 22 Jan 96 p1)<p>

<b>Writing Contest:</b> O'Reilly &amp; Associates will publish winners of a $5,000 writing contest called "Spider or Fly?"
dealing with the general question:  "Are we masters of the Web or trapped in it?" and the relationships between
technology and human consequences. Info:  &lt;http://www.ora.com/staff/ stevet /netfuture/ &gt;.<p>

<b>Ellerbee on Encarta:</b>  "NBC News Overnight" host Linda Ellerbee will work with Microsoft to create a monthly  online
interview show available on the Encarta Encyclopedia Web site &lt;http://www.microsoft. com/encarta &gt;.  The first
"Encarta on the Record" show will debut Feb. 21 at 9:30 p.m. EST.  (Investor's Business Daily 29 Jan 96 A6)<p>

<p>

<b>Japanese Internet Users Are Night-owls</b>: Due to significantly cheaper night-time phone rates, Web surfers in Japan
do most of their cruising after dark.  "Two years ago I was the first commercial Internet provider in Japan.  Today there
are 45 Internet service providers in Tokyo alone," says the president of Global OnLine Japan, who says his heaviest
usage time is midnight. (Scientific American Jan 96 p36).<p>

<FONT size=6 COLOR="#0000af">MOUSE TALES: A column about the
Macintosh</FONT><P>

<FONT size=5 COLOR="#0000aF">By George Herman</FONT>

<P><HR></P>

<P>When the Mac was new, its mission was clear. It was the computer
for the person who wanted to use a computer, but did not want or need
to know how computers worked. As the big, complex Macs began to
appear, that vision was never totally lost. Along came the Performa
to declare the Mac's mission loudly once again. It came from the
factory loaded with software, ready to use when it was plugged in! It
was the computer for a person who knew nothing about computers to buy
fearlessly from a salesman who knew nothing about computers! That
turned out to be truer than Apple had in mind, I think. A lot of
department store Performa purchasers come to our user group, looking
for the information computer store sales staff would have given to
the customer.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>It happened that a new Performa owner came to the help station at
our user group. I forget now what her problem was, but it was both
trivial and easy to solve. So I began to explain to her, "First of
all, open your system folder..."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>She interrupted me. "I don't have a system folder," she said. Now
if you don't have a system folder, you don't have a Macintosh.
Everything that makes it work like a Mac is either in a couple of
chips or in that system folder!</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Well, poor lady, she had to sit down and hear a (reasonably) brief
lecture on operating systems. I thought of her the other day when I
booted my Mac with System 7.5. After a smiling Mac face and a
"Welcome to Macintosh" window, I got an abstract drawing of a human
face and the proud announcement, "Mac OS." System 7.5 wants every Mac
user to know that he or she has an operating system, by gosh, and the
wonderful Mac OS at that!</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Without an operating system, any computer is just a good
paperweight. The OS takes care of opening, closing, and saving files;
it manages printing and other kinds of output from the computer, and
input from the keyboard, from disks, scanners, microphones and what
not else. The Mac OS handles a lot of things that PC-DOS (Personal
computer disk operating system, used by IBM computers) and MS-DOS
(MicroSoft disk operating system, used by so-called IBM-compatible
computers) do not bother with.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>When you use the Edit menu items Copy, Cut, and Paste they behave
the same way no matter what kind of application program you are
using. That's because those operations are built into the OS, and the
program you are running need only ask the OS to carry them out. The
OS manages the Clipboard that Edit operations require. The same is
true of the graphics operations the Mac handles so prettily, and the
things you find in every File menu - Save, Save As, Page Setup,
Print, and the like.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Why is the OS that Mac users in the 80's might not have known was
there, now advertised proudly every time the Mac starts up with
system 7.5? I'm not a Silicon Valley insider, so this is just my
speculation, but I can think of at least two possible reasons.
Nowadays, a little less than half the working adults in the United
States make some use of a computer in their business. The future big
market for computers is in the school, college, and office. Pure
hobbyists (like I used to be) who always use the machine for the fun
of it will soon not be a big part of the customer base. Apple has to
convince the business world that the Mac is not a pretty graphics
toy, and to get people to see it as the high-tech machine it is. That
makes it all right to start talking tech to the customer. And now we
have the clones - the Macintosh-compatible computers. What makes the
computers manufactured by others Macintosh- Compatible? The Mac OS
does, and every user of one of those machines will be reminded of
that, every time it starts up. The Macintosh culture is no longer
just a hardware culture. (Rumor has it that if the clones chew up a
big share of the hardware market, Apple will start thinking of itself
as mainly a software (including the</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>OS) producer. Every Mac no longer looks like every other Mac, and
the non-Apple Macs will be even less familiar looking. So we can
expect to keep being reminded that we are in Mac territory by seeing
the Mac OS proudly advertised every time we boot up!</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#AF0000">Shareware:Almost Free Stuff For Your
PC.</FONT>

<P><HR></P>

<P>To many of you out there, shareware is one of those nifty little
$2-$5 programs, perhaps a game or clip art disk, that you tend to
pick up at a computer show. And in some respects that is what
shareware is. It is also one of the most cost-effective way to
test-drive software. Whether it consists of a few levels of a game, a
disabled version of an application, or a full-fledged utility,
shareware offers you a great low-risk way to try before you buy. The
premise behind shareware was you got to try it out for free. If you
liked it, a sort of honor system requested that you pay the developer
a registration fee. The fee usually got you a manual or updated
version of the program. Things have changed somewhat these days with
most of the large software manufacturers offering slimed down
versions of their programs as "shareware" at web sites, on CD-Rom and
disk.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Some of the best multimedia software on the market is free--or
almost free. For little or no money down, you can play shareware
versions Doom, Warcraft II, Quake, and Duke Nukem 3D; sample
essential utilities such as PKZip; use a trial version of web page
design software such as Delta Point's QuickSite; and compare Web
browsers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In the past, shareware distribution was the domain of very small
companies with a catalog and/or a vendor presence at computer shows.
With the explosion of the web, that has changed dramaticly. In fact,
the Internet is fast becoming a shareware treasure trove, with
vendors giving away software in hopes of gaining market share and
becoming the de facto standard. Why the best web broswer around,
Microsoft's Internet Explorer, is just a free download away. The Net
also functions as an alternative distribution method for traditional
shareware--games and utilities--but beware of the hidden costs of
spending hours online downloading a trial version. In some instances,
you'll find that it's substantially cheaper to pay $5 or $10 for a
sample disc from a vendor.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>If you haven't tried shareware yet, you should. Old time users
have long treasured shareware as a great way to checkout "lite or
streamlined' versions of many different products and make informed
buying decisions. There are three types of shareware: interactive
demos that offer a portion of a game or application that is somehow
disabled (you can't save files or print, for instance); full-fledged
applications that expire after a short test period; and applications
and utilities that rely on the honor system for payment if you decide
to keep them.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>An example of the fisrt type is Doom. The shareware version
offered one level for the game. But what a level it was. It quickly
hooked millions of players; who then had to buy the full version to
get to the next level. Doom became one of the best selling games of
all time. The second type of shareware can be seen in the web browser
Netscape offers. Th full-blown version of Netscape Navigator can be
downloaed for free from the internet. However, the program expires
after a period of time and you must go back and download it again; or
buy the commercial version. A leading example of this last type of
shareware is PKWare's compression utility PKZip, which can be found
on almost every online service and at many Web sites. PKWare offers
its program for evaluation, with the expectation that you'll purchase
a license if you opt to add the utility to your software library.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This month, we've put together a list of some must have shareware
and some great places to find it at. Enjoy.</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>Jumbo:</I>
<A HREF="http://www.jumbo.com">http://www.jumbo.com</A></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I think this is the best shareware/freeware library in cyberspace.
Why? Jumbo's easy-to-use search tool helps you find what you need in
the nearly 50,000 files in categories such as business, education,
graphics, and games. A brief description of each file is included.
The files actually reside on servers around the world; Jumbo acts
like a giant switchboard to give you links to all the sites holding
the particular program. Select the site closest to you for the
speediest download.</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>Windows95.com:</I>
<A HREF="http://www.windows95.com">http://www.windows95.com</A></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Its selection of freeware isn't quite as comprehensive as Jumbo's.
Nevertheless, Windows95.com is worth a visit, primarily for its
innovative interface that includes Windows-style icons and a Taskbar.
</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>CompuServe go windows:</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This is a good starting point for accessing CompuServe's vast
storehouse of Windows-related software libraries. You'll find plenty
of freeware, too. For instance, you can download a free trial edition
of Quarterdeck's CleanSweep 95, a 32-bit Windows 95 application that
uninstalls both Windows 3.x and Windows 95 applications. There are
also free Windows 95 Web browsers such as NCSA Mosaic 2.0 and
Internet Explorer 2.0.</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>Galt Technologies Shareware Zone:
</I><A HREF="http://wwwgalttech.com/index.shtml">http://wwwgalttech.com/index.shtml</A>
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This site offers access to thousands of shareware programs. Like
Jumbo, it has a searchable database and lays out the programs in
various categories. It also features a top ten downl;oad section that
you can just click on and get the latest and hottest programs.</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>America Online Keyword: file search</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Here's an easy way to search America Online's vast collection of
software files for all available downloads, including dozens of free
Windows applications and utilities. To use File Search: First load
the search engine by clicking the File Search icon (or by typing file
search in the Keyword dialog box). Next search All Categories (or
specific individual categories such as Applications, Games, Windows,
and so on) for the word freeware.</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>Microsoft:<A HREF="  http://www.msn.com"> </I>
http://www.msn.com</A></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>If you want free Microsoft software, head to the company's Web
site. The Windows software library is well organized, with a separate
section for downloading Microsoft Office macros, the Internet
Explorer 2.0 Web browser, utilities such as the Microsoft Word
Technical Dictionary, and a self-running Microsoft Office for Windows
95 demo. (Microsoft Network users should head here, too. MSN itself
is sadly lacking in comparable content.) --J. B.</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>Caddy Hack: Haunted Minature Golf </I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This alternately gruesome and cute sports simulation crosses
Access Software's Links Golf with Virgin's 7th Guest. The shareware
CD consists of the first of the nine holes contained in the retail
version of the game--all 40MB of it. So what is a haunted miniature
golf course? Imagine putting through a junkyard filled with such
menacing paraphernalia as a headless doll with an overly active
chainsaw. Add in a chip shot through the mouth of a dead animal, and
you have the basic idea. The graphics are digitized photographs of
elaborate models, so everything looks chillingly real. Virgin
Interactive Entertainment, 714-833-1999</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>Descent II </I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Ready to fly through twisting, cork-screw tunnels at high speeds?
Descent II takes pilots on hostage-rescue missions into Doom-like
mines where renegade robots attempt to destroy everything that moves.
Descent II's fuzzy graphics and spiraling high-speed flight through
the mine shafts may make some players nauseous, but this thrilling
cat-and-mouse game is worth the risk. Break out the Dramamine.
Interplay Productions, 800-468-3775</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>Duke Nukem 3D </I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This game may well break Doom's record for shareware sales. Nukem
3D begins in a sleazy Los Angeles movie theater and leads players
through an eerily familiar inner-city setting populated by evil
creatures who pack really big guns. One cool feature was the ability
to go underwater and to move and look up and down. I love the
shrinker ray as well. What fun it is to crush your enemies after they
have been reduced to the size of a mouse. With its excellent 3-D
graphics and realistic settings, Nukem 3D more than just a solid Doom
knockoff. Download it free from

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In the first WarCraft, orcs and humans battled each other over
land. WarCraft II: Tides of Darkness expands the scope of operations:
Now the antagonists use barges and elf-planes to chase each other
across continents. The shareware version contains 6 of the complete
game's 28 campaign scenarios. WarCraft II combines the strategy of
SimCity with the sweeping aggression of the board game Risk.
Unfortunately, the abbreviated shareware version consists of
relatively simple missions that involve building armies, navies, and
cities while attempting to locate and destroy a limited array of
foes. (demo CD, $7.99) * Blizzard Entertainment/ Davidson,
714-955-1382</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>America's Best Bed &amp; Breakfast: </I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Itching to get up and go somewhere? You'll find photos and
information about 461 inns in the United States, Puerto Rico, and
Canada. Each listing resembles an advertisement, and comparisons and
ratings are nonexistent. Along with photos of each inn, America's
Best Bed &amp; Breakfasts features menus from most locations, and
even recipes for some dishes. The software suffers from a shortage of
sites, however: The number of inns listed for some U.S. states is
small, and for some Canadian territories there are none at all.
Despite this dearth, America's Best Bed &amp; Breakfasts has a lot of
information to help users plan and arrange a stylish vacation.

<P><I>Association of Shareware Professionals</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This essential monthly CD-ROM compendium of more than 1,600
shareware programs is distributed by an international trade
organization that represents authors, publishers, vendors, and online
distributors. We looked at the July, which offered 15 new titles,
among them 77 Windows 3.x and 14 Windows 95 programs, including
games, utilities, clip art, and communications software. The Windows
search tool lets you quickly find the programs you want. $14.95 ($10

<P><I>Family Tree Journal </I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The designers of Family Tree Journal must care more about the past
than the present. As a genealogical utility, the product has
everything you need. The database includes fields for births, deaths,
multiple marriages, and educational history. The shareware comes with
additional modules for recording stories, addresses, and other
ancillary data. Many of these features are lost, however, in Family
Tree Journal's archaic DOS interface and dated-looking red and blue
screens. Simply put, this history program looks prehistoric. Cherry

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>So Much for Windows 95</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Here's an indication of how much shareware is on the market. So
Much for Windows95 is a single CD that contains "1,001 Top-Ranked
Programs" for Windows. With 1,000 programs squeezed into a single CD,
So Much for Windows95 obviously has both bombs and beauties among its
hundreds of games, utilities, and other programs. A silly game that
calculates the number of days until your 21st birthday shares
directory space with an excellent version of mah-jongg. All of these
shareware programs can be accessed through a well-designed interface
that zips and unzips files. So Much for Windows95 is an excellent
sampler of the best new shareware. Power User Software, 814-864-4666

<P><I>Paint Shop Pro</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Though easy to learn, Paint Shop Pro offers a surprisingly wide
variety of art tools for both creating and customizing graphics. The
graphical interface has icons for everything from scanning to
cloning. Paint Shop Pro even has precision tools such as a histogram
window that graphs the colors in images by luminance and full-palette
color selection. JASC, 800-622-2793</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>TrueSpace2 </I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Before you spend $500 for TrueSpace2, try out this leading 3-D
design and animation tool for 30 days. It can be downloaded for free
at <A HREF="http://www.caligari.com">http://www.caligari.com</A> or
obtained on CD-ROM for a combined shipping and handling fee of
$14.95. TrueSpace2 is an exceptional tool for rendering</P>

<P>three-dimensional, photo-realistic, sculpted objects. It contains
a library of basic shapes that can be manipulated and enhanced with
textures to create 3-D objects. The 30-day shareware demo of
TrueSpace2 comes with several textures and a number of powerful tools
that enable you to achieve a wide range of effects. Once you create a
shape, you can texture it to look like anything from chrome to pine.
TrueSpace2 even includes lighting effects. For such a complex tool,
TrueSpace2 is surprisingly easy to learn, and most users will be
experimenting with new ideas within hours of downloading it.

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>PKZip for Windows</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>PKZip is a simple utility that combines and compresses files. It
lets you bundle letters and digitized photographs or reports and
charts into a single file so you can send them over the Internet
easily. The utility does an excellent job of storing files and saving
disk space. PKWare, 414-354-8699</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>ViaCrypt PGP 4.0, Personal Edition</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Some businesses use scrambling equipment to secure telephone
conversations; others that transmit sensitive data have turned to
encryption software to protect their privacy. ViaCrypt PGP (Pretty
Good Privacy) encrypts files into a nearly impregnable format--one so
secure that this freeware is classified as a munition and cannot
legally be exported. The freeware version is available for
noncommercial use only. Though it works in DOS, the basic commands
are easy to learn. ViaCrypt 4.0, 602-944-0773</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>Screen Thief </I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Screen Thief is among a handful of programs that let you take
digital still shots of other computer programs as they run. Simply
load Screen Thief into RAM before running other programs and hit
keyboard commands when you want to capture a screen image. The
pictures are stored as PCX files, which can be used and viewed with
most word-processing and desktop publishing programs. However, many
games use so much RAM that they won't run in tandem with Screen
Thief. Nildram Software/FormGen, 800-263-2390</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>Telix for Windows</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>As communications managers go, the shareware version of Telix for
Windows competes well with such established giants as Delrina's
WinCom. It allows background transfers, features a powerful user
phone book, and has a fairly understandable graphical interface. The
retail version even allows you to view image files during downloads.
The shareware version of Telix for Windows has two main drawbacks: It
does not display GIF files and (like other shareware programs) it
turns itself off after a 45-day trial period. DeltaComm Development/
FormGen, 800-263-2390</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>WinZip Self-Extract </I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The purpose of this tiny utility is to decompress zipped files,
letting you distribute multiple copies of zipped files that unzip
automatically when accessed. You simply type the name of the zipped
file and the directory where you wish to place its contents. Then
WinZip Self-Extractor does the rest. Nico Mak Computing,

<P><I>Netscape Navigator</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>With advanced features such as framing and progressive rendering
of graphics, and with more proprietary extensions than its
competitors can offer, Netscape Navigator 2.0 is one of the best
Internet browsers available.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Tapping into this extra power, many companies have used Netscape
server tools to create their Web sites. In fact, "Netscape Enhanced"
has become a common sign along the information superhighway. free

<P><I>Shockwave</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Shockwave is a plug-in that allows Internet browsers to access
animations created with Macromedia Director. Since Director handles
both audio and visual effects, it provides an effective way to
advertise on the Internet. It also enables publishers to jazz up
their Web sites considerably. Free at

1995 edition at our web site.</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>With the growing size of computer games, downloading shareware
versions from the Internet or from bulletin boards is becoming less
practical. Though most shareware utilities occupy only a few
megabytes of storage, many popular games and multimedia tools are
considerably bigger. The shareware demos of WarCraft II by Blizzard
Entertainment, Stonekeep by Interplay, and Caddy Hack by Virgin
Interactive Entertainment, for instance, each take up more than 40MB
and are far too large to download from a bulletin board or web site.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>At those sizes, the only practical way to distribute shareware is
on CD-ROM, which has led many developers to charge a nominal fee to
recoup their production and distribution costs. Charging for
shareware is the antithesis of what shareware is about--providing
users with a free product evaluation so developers have begun
creating special slimmed-down Internet versions of these bloated
shareware demos. However, as all of us who have used shareware over
the years, you always had to pay for the disk the program was on -
the program was free - the disk was $2, 3 or 5 dollars.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Blizzard Entertainment is at the forefront of this trend. "We have
an 11MB electronic demo version that you can download off the
Internet," said Michael Morhaime, lead programmer and lead producer
of WarCraft II. "We split it up into eight 1.5MB files, so you can
download it in several sittings."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Nonetheless, many users may find it easier to spend the $10 for
the 42MB shareware CD-ROM being distributed by Davidson &amp;
Associates. Not only is it simpler to get, but the CD-ROM demo also
includes high-quality audio files and other dramatic touches stripped
from the Internet version.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There are alternatives to retail. Shareware clubs, such as Micro
Star's Software Club, offer a monthly shareware disc that members can
sample and then either return or purchase. Membership is $49.95 plus
shipping fees. And of course there is still plenty of good small
shareware online. One great place to start perusing the online
selection of shareware is the huge HappyPuppy Web site. Find it at

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#AF0000">THE OTHER 16%: ALTERNATIVES TO
NETSCAPE</FONT><p>
<FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#AF0000">By Brian T. Kelley</FONT>
<P><HR></P>
<P>If you surf the Web, chances are, you're using some version of
Netscape Navigator; Netscape has an 84% share of the browser market.
Perhaps you're satisfied with it. Perhaps you like applications that
consume huge amounts of RAM and are reluctant to let it go to other
open apps. You might like frames, which not only waste valuable
screen-real-estate but also are an aesthetic nightmare. Maybe you're
happy with Navigator.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I wasn't. That's why I began my "Quest for the Perfect
Web-Browser." I didn't find perfection (for that, I would have to
code it myself to meet my own entirely subjective criteria), but I
did find many good ones, alternatives to what I refer to as "The
Netscape Hegemony." Here are the results of my quest.</P>
<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>
<P><B>Mosaic:</B> The very first Web-browser, and it shows. Although
Mosaic's clean and simple design are still worth emulating, the
performance is just not there. There are "enhanced" commercial
versions available, as well as the original NCSA model. Lean and
reasonably speedy, Mosaic is a good "down and dirty" browser if RAM
is tight.</P>
<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>
<P><B>Cyberdog:</B> Originally a showpiece for Apple's OpenDoc
technology, Cyberdog has now become a key part of that company's
Internet strategy. While the OpenDoc system is brilliant, Cyberdog
(currently available as a 1.0, although I beta-tested the last
pre-release version and they're virtually identical) is still a pup.
Touted as "an integrated suite of Internet utilities," Cyberdog has
great potential, but is still fairly twitchy and unreliable. A great
idea that needs more work.</P>
<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>
<P><B>Lynx: </B>Sure, multimedia capability is what has made the Web
such a hot item. But if you don't want to spend you time waiting for
huge inline graphics to display and worthless Java applets to
download, the text-only Lynx is a great way to get information in a
hurry. Use terminal-emulation to connect with your Internet service
provider, use the SLIP portion of your SLIP/PPP account, and be
amazed at the speed. It's not pretty, but it works beautifully.</P>
<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>
<P><B>And the winner is...</B></P>
<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>
<P><B>Microsoft's Internet Explorer:</B> Hands down, the best browser
available. Instead of making you wait for images to load before you
can see the text (this is especially annoying if all you're looking
for on a page is a link to another page or URL), or forcing you to
turn off the "Auto-Load Images" option, Explorer inserts
place-holders for images, displays the text, then starts inserting
the inline graphics. It may sound like a small thing, but this has
made using the Web much more pleasurable and much less frustrating.
Explorer is explicitly based on Mosaic, and Microsoft has done a
surprisingly good job of keeping the best features of Mosaic, adding
a few innovations of their own (which I actually like!), and not
straying too far from the original. It supports tables, takes Java
plug-ins and (hurrah) doesn't do frames. It does require a great deal
of RAM, but that is my only complaint.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>All in all, the lesson I've learned from my Quest is simply this:
if you're not satisfied with a browser, or any other program, look
around and find an alternative. Keep looking until you find what you
want. Just because something is popular doesn't necessarily mean it's
the best for you.</P>

<H2><FONT Size=6 COLOR="#0000af">Ready for the Speed of ISDN?</FONT></H2>

<H3><FONT Size=5 COLOR="#0000af">By Craig Crossman</FONT></H3>

<P><HR></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>QUESTION:</P>

<P>I want to get ISDN service for fast 128 Kbps Internet access. But
my serial port only goes up to 115 Kbps. What should I do?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>ANSWER:</P>

<P>ISDN, or Integrated Services Digital Network, has been around for
a long time but is just now becoming affordable. Since it uses
standard telephone wiring, ISDN can be installed without alterations
to phone lines or jacks.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Your concern about exceeding the speed of your serial port should
be a deja vu experience for the many who upgraded to today's 28.8
Kbps (bits-per-second) modems, only to find that the serial ports
were too slow.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Today's multimedia PCs and Macs can easily handle 28.8 but have an
upper limit of 115 Kbps. Since ISDN tops out at 128 Kbps, you will
have to set it for the slower speed unless you opt to get either a
high-speed serial card or an internal ISDN modem.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Actually, modem is the wrong term, since it applies to an analog
device and ISDN is digital. The correct terminology is "terminal
adapter" but for this article, I'll just call it a modem -- as many
in the industry have elected to do, since most associate the word
modem with a gizmo that hooks a computer to the phone line. Your best
bet is to get an internal ISDN modem, since it plugs directly into
your computer and bypasses the serial port.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>On the PC side, Motorola will be introducing an internal BitSurfer
Pro ISDN modem ($495) complete with everything you need.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>On the Macintosh side, Sagem has just introduced NuBus and PCI
Planet-ISDN Cards ($495). Sagem offers a Macintosh GeoPort modem
($395), as well. In addition to being able to access the Web at 128
Kbps, these devices are synchronous, as opposed to the external
devices, which are asynchronous.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Think of asynchronous as being analogous to turning your water tap
on and off. This start and stop phenomenon is necessary to keep the
stream of water from filling up the glass too quickly. Fill it too
fast and you have an overflow.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Synchronous is like turning on the tap full blast, because you
know the receptacle can accept the stream as fast as it can be sent.
With computers, eliminating the on and off overhead gives the fastest
utilization of your ISDN service.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>You need to know up front that installing ISDN is not for the
faint-hearted. You'll need a knowledgeable person to assist. But ISDN
will let you see the Internet like you've never seen it before. It's
fast! You'll see graphic images and data snap onto your screen,
instead of the usual fizzle of a 28.8 appearance.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>One other consideration: Make sure your Internet service provider
offers ISDN access. This is still pretty cutting-edge stuff, and only
some ISPs have the equipment to handle ISDN. Sagem (408) 446-8690;
Motorola (800) 365-6456</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>QUESTION:</P>

<P>Is there some kind of universal spell-checker that will correct
errors in all my applications, not just in word processing? I need to
make sure my e-mail is correct. I have a Macintosh.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>ANSWER:</P>

<P>Check out SpellCatcher, from Casady &amp; Greene. In just about
any application, SpellCatcher checks errors as you type. Or you can
have it check an existing document.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>SpellCatcher ($79.95) includes a thesaurus and Ghostwriter, a
feature that constantly saves all your keystrokes to disks.
Ghostwriter is nice in case of a power failure or system crash. When
you restart, nothing is lost, since you can cut and paste
Ghostwriter's data back into your application.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Shorthand Glossary lets you define and abbreviate commonly used
phrases. Type "vty" and "Very truly yours" appears instantly. Casady
&amp; Greene (800) 359-4920 or (408) 484-9228</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Redmond, WA -- Microsoft Corporation chair, CEO and all-around
babe magnet Bill Gates announced yesterday the introduction of a new
product for Windows 95: Microsoft Panhandling. "The idea came to me
the other day when a homeless man asked me for money,"recalls Gates.
"I suddenly realized that we were missing a golden opportunity. Here
was a chance to make a profit without any initial monetary
investment. Naturally, this man then became my competition, so I had
my limo driver run over him several times."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Microsoft engineers have been working around the clock to complete
Gates' vision of panhandling for the 21st century. "We feel that our
program designers really understand how the poor and needy situation
works," says Microsoft Homeless product leader Bernard Liu. "Except
for the fact that they're stinking rich."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Microsoft Panhandling will be automatically installed with Windows
95. At random intervals, a dialog box pops up, asking the user if
they could spare any change so that Microsoft has enough money to get
a hot meal. ("This is a little lie," admits software engineer Adam
Miller, "since our diet consists of Coke and Twinkies, but what
panhandler doesn't embellish a little?") The user can click Yes, in
which case a random amount of change between $.05 and $142.50 is
transferred from the user's bank account to Microsoft's. The user can
also respond No, in which case the program politely tells the user to
have a nice day. The "No" button has not yet been implemented.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>"We're experiencing a little trouble programming the No button,"
Bernard Liu says, "but we should definitely have it up and running
within the next couple of years. Or at least by the time Windows 2014
comes out. Maybe."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Gates says this is just the start of an entire line of products.
"Be on the lookout for products like Microsoft Mugging, which either
takes $50 or erases your hard drive, and Microsoft Squegee Guy, which
will clean up your Windows for a dollar." (When Microsoft Squegee Guy
ships, Windows 95 will no longer automatically refresh your windows.)
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>But there are competitors on the horizon. Sun Microsystems and
Oracle Corporation are introducing panhandling products of their own.
"Gates is a few tacos short of a combination platter, if you get my
drift," says Oracle Head Honcho and 3rd degree black belt Larry
Ellison. "I mean, in the future, we won't need laptop computers
asking you for change. You'll have an entire network of machines
asking you for money."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Gates responded with, "I know what you are, but what am I?"
General pandemonium then ensued.</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>Of course this isn't a real program but just some clever humor.
Thanks to Virg for finding it and thanks to the person who authored
it. If we knew who you were, we would be glad to give you proper
credit.</I></P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#0000AF">Program Helps Web Browsers Keep Track of
Their Bookmarks</FONT><p>
<FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000AF">By Ed Lansing</FONT><P><HR></FONT></P>
<P>Surfboard 1.0 is a bookmark manager that looks much like a TV remote control sitting on
your desktop. You can drag it anywhere on the screen. To see all the bookmarks inside, you click
on the remote's side and a drawer glides out, listing all your bookmarks. You scroll up and down
by clicking the arrows.</P>

<P>The surface of the remote displays nine vertically placed buttons.
Each displays a category label you can define, such as "Newspapers"
or "Search Sites." Click and hold on one of these buttons and you see
all of the bookmarks in that category. Let go and your browser
instantly goes to the selected Web address. To add a bookmark, simply
open the remote's drawer, select the bookmark and drag and drop it on
top of the button.</P>

<P>When you visit a new Web location and decide to keep the address,
click on Surfboard's "add" button. It will automatically be added to
your bookmark collection. Another button remembers your 15 most
frequently visited sites for fast access and is automatically updated
by Surfboard as you browse the Web.</P>

<P>If you find your collection becoming too cumbersome, the same
button also lets you quickly switch to a different master bookmark
list. These lists redefine the nine button categories and preserve a
completely new set of bookmarks you have associated with them.
Ideally, you'll set up master lists with the nine buttons acting as
subcategories. And to make things easy when you start, all of your
current browser's bookmarks can be directly imported into a Surfboard
list.</P>

<P>As a final touch, Surfboard can detect whether your Web browser is
active. If not, it can launch the browser and log you on with one
click. Surfboard's indicator also changes color when the modem logs
you online. If you need help, simply click on the customer service
button and you are immediately transferred to Abbott's help site. You
can also download sample Surfboard lists containing Web sites that
Abbott thinks you might find interesting.</P>

<P>Surfboard 1.0 ($39) works with both Netscape Navigator and
Microsoft Explorer. Abbott Systems (800) 552-9157 or (914) 747-3116

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#AF0000">Censorship and the Internet - A rational
solution</FONT><p>
<FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#AF0000">By Peter Connolly</FONT>
<P><HR></P>
<P>Those who are celebrating the recent defeat of the Communications
Decency Act should be concerned about celebrating too soon The
political history of censorship indicates that this may be only one
battle in a long war fought on many fronts</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>For example, the Suprerne Court's decision that government has the
right to delimit what can be shown on television between the hours of
6 A.M. and 1O PM, also has frightening implications for censorship on
the Internet This determination that the government has a
responsibility to protect minors from certain types of programming
could easily be applied to communication networks. The pressure from
Germany's government that caused America On-Line to restrict access
to certain sites in response to that government's uneasjness with the
availability of pornography on the Net also appoints government as
the interpreter of what is moral and what is indecent on the Net. The
very fact that the Communications Decency provision was allowed to be
added to the Telecomrnunications Reform Act in the first place,
indicates that our elected officials feel that it is their duty to
protect us from indiecency</P>
<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>
<P><B>The Issues</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>All of the blue ribbons and black home pages in cyberspace won't
change the fact that there's pornography on the net. Like everyone
who surfs the net, I chance across sites that purport to contain
pornography, however, they are well marked and avoidable. If you
choose to go down that path, then you know what you are getting into;
if` your decision is to go elsewhere you are not harmed. So what are
the real issues! Is it that pornography exists on the Net or is it
its accessibility? In our society, under some guise or other, it will
always be there (and there will always be an objection to it). For
example, if you made a detailed study of your local library, searched
every book and magazine, you could conceivably come up with a sizable
amount of what some would consider X-rated material. But is taking a
paragraph here, and a chapter there, and lumping them together, a
valid reason to close down the library or burn some of the books? Is
the presence of pornography in some areas of the net a valid reason
to censor the entire Internet?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I think that most would agree that the legal thrust should
proscribe access for those who legally cannot view pornography and
announce it loudly enough for those who do not desire to see it.
Afler all, that's how most communities handle adult bookstores and
movie houses. However, the main problem with this approach is the
difficulty of applying coinmunity standards to the cyber community.
Diffilculties abound due to the virtual nature of the network
citizenry and the attempt to now define global cornmunty standards.
It should be noted here that we're not talking about child
pornography. That is illegal everywhere and should not be allowed
anywhere. We're discussing adult material that is legal in most
states for adults to privately possess for their own use. If we put
aside all of the rhetoric and emotions, we still come down to the
basic issue - accessibiIity.</P>
<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>
<P><B>A Rational, Non-Governmental Solution</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If we want to solve this problem without a spate of new laws
confining everyone within government-dictated morality boundaries. we
have to let technology and the marketplace exert its influence.
Obviously, for this to happen, there must be a commercial need and
the technology must be available to fill that need The desire for
some type of control is already being demanded by parents who do not
or can not effectively monitor net access by their children. They see
the widespread availability of pornography and contend that adult
access screens will not stop a fifteen year old from loging on to a
site intended for those over eighteen. Employers are also concerned
that productive work time is being wasted by employees exploring not
only adult material but other non-work related sites. The need for
access control will also be necessary in schools below the college
level and most likely in public access areas where demand for
"legitimate" research is high So there is a legitimate requirement
for some type of access control.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>How can technology address the problem? In some instances this is
already being done. Filtering and blocking programs such as Cyber
Patrol(TM) by Microsystems, and Net Nanny(TM) by Trove Investment
Corporation already exist. Products such as these generally work on
key words such as "sex", "violence", "adult", "nudity", etc., plus
access to a table of prohibitive sites and can allow the user to set
up their own dictionary of prohibited key words. In most cases the
cost is minimal or free. However, these products require action by
the adult (or employer- or- teacher) to either keep the dictionary
updated and/or to monitor- violations and confront the offenders.
More and more of- these individual site blockers will probably appear
as cyber- malls and other large commercial ventures realize that
unless they provide a g-rated access option, they will restrict their
financial potential. The drawback to this method of control is the
requirement of either maintenance by someone designated as the censor
or the acceptance of the product developer- as the censor.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>What I believe that the marketplace will demand and technology
will provide is a virtual net concept that will cater to families,
businesses and schools by supplying tailored networks that will
fulfill requested standards. In a sense, the Americaa On-line action
mentioned in the beginning of this article is a hint of-that
direction. Setting up subscription Cyber Communities with clearly
defined community standards will allow users to explore and work in a
neighborhood where they will feel safe and be productive. Those who
feel that they need a taste of "Times Square" will also he able to
move to that neighborhood when they desire. The important concept is
that everything will still be available but controlled by the
subscriber- Freedom of speech will be preserved. The cyber community
provider will be responsible for ensuring that the links remain
within the standards and the user will control the browsing with
passwords for restricted neighborhoods. Unfortunately, the government
will be involved somehow; it will happen no matter what. But if
technology and the commercial interests can combine to allow virtual
communjty standards, censorship can be directed where it belongs. To
that which does not meet any society's standards, that is hurtfill to
everyone and does not belong in any neighborhood.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#AF0000">Macintosh Operating System</FONT><p>
<FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#AF0000">By Brian T. Kelley</FONT>

<P><HR></P>

<P>Mac OS 8 (initially known by the code-name "Copland") will be the
first complete revision of the Macintosh system software since the
Mac was introduced in 1984. Until now, all new versions of the OS
were based on earlier versions, so the current version (System 7.5.3)
contains code originally intended for a machine with a black and
white monitor, 128K of RAM, and no hard drive. Considered from this
vantage point, it's miraculous that System 7.5.3 works as well as it
does (or, indeed, at all).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Based on Apple's revolutionary OpenDoc technology (see below), Mac
OS 8 promises to require less memory, be more stable, robust and
reliable, and run native on PowerPC machines for improved speed and
performance.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Unfortunately, 8 is late. The shipping schedule keeps getting
pushed back. Currently, Apple promises a release for software
developers later this year, and a mid-1997 release for the rest of
us. However, given the history of delays this project has experienced
since its inception, prudent persons aren't holding their breath.
</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>THE 8-FOLD PATH: PROBLEMS/CHALLENGES</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>One of the biggest stumbling blocks on the road to OS 8 is
backward compatibility. Getting current versions of applications to
work under the new system is of paramount importance, because many
people would rather stick with the old OS rather than be forced to
buy OS 8-compatible versions of the programs they use. Because of
this, Apple and many third-party developers are being very careful to
make the transition to 8 as painless as possible for end-users.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Under OS 8, there will no longer be extensions and control panels.
Their functionality will be assumed by OpenDoc documents. Commercial
programs which rely on extensions and control panels will be hit
hardest by this change. It remains to be seen how this problem will
be resolved.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>--WHY 8 WILL BE GREAT--</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Despite the problems inherent in</P>

<P>completely re-writing the operating system, Mac OS 8 has the
potential for being "insanely great."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The look and feel of the Mac will be greatly streamlined and
enhanced under OS 8. The Graphical User Interface (always the crown
jewel of the Macintosh treasury) will be more customizable, according
to the user's aesthetics and style of working.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Active assistance will be available from "agents." Not only will
the Mac show you how to do something, it will go ahead (with your
permission) and do it for you. Simple, repetitive, time-consuming
tasks will be automated away, leaving you free to work or play as you
see fit.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>8 will bring us closer to true pre-emptive multitasking.
Currently, we can have more than one application open, but the open
apps have to "co-operate" and share the computer's processor.
Competition for processor time leads to applications stepping on each
other's toes (so to speak) and system crashes are the all-too-common
result. 8 will have an improved system of scheduling CPU time, and
high-priority tasks will actually be given a higher priority!</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>OS 8 will rely heavily on OpenDoc technology. OpenDoc documents
(or "parts") can be grouped together to function in concert. The
resulting group of parts (called a "container") works like the
applications of today.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The greatest benefit of the OpenDoc system is the ease of adding
new functions, simply by dropping another part into an existing
container.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>OpenDoc v.1.04 is currently available, although the only container
you can get now is Cyberdog, Apple's nice (albeit flawed) suite of
integrated Internet utilities.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>--PIECES OF 8--</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Apple has wisely decided to release individual parts of OS 8 as
they're ready, rather than saving them all for one mega-event release
(a la Microsoft's Windows 95). Some features, like OpenTransport and
Quickdraw 3D, are available now as part of System 7.5.3. Others are
forthcoming, in an interim release scheduled for later this year,
code-named "Harmony."</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>--IS 8 WORTH THE WAIT?--</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Despite the attendant hassles (chief of which being
compatibility), Mac OS 8 looks to be the OS of the 21st century, the
one that other companies will spend the early years of the next
millenium trying to imitate.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000af">Microsoft Office and Works: two great
packages for two different users.</FONT><p>
<FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#000af">By Ted Brockwood</FONT>

<P><B><HR></B></P>

<P>Microsoft has always had a strong foothold in the business world
with its Word and Excel applications, but these days the software
giant isn't going to rest on the laurels of two products. Instead,
after watching the near demise of Novell's WordPerfect Suite (and its
newest incarnation as Corel's WordPerfect), Microsoft has pressed to
the front of the pack in both big business computing , and home user
computing with its Microsoft Office Suite and its sister suite
Microsoft Works.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Microsoft Office is definitely designed with the power user or the
business user in mind. The mammoth package contains two CD ROM's
packed with all the applications a user could ever want. These
include:</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Word</B>: The ever popular word-processor that seems to be on
almost every computer user's desktop these days. If your office isn't
using Word, they are probably creating much more hassle for
themselves (especially when dealing with Word using clients) than
they need to. Word gobbles up other document formats and spits out
beautiful fully crafted presentation quality documents. Training
manuals, correspondences , faxes, and memos become works of business
art with the spelling, grammar, and layout features that Word is
famous for.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Excel</B>: Excel is considered by many to be the best
spreadsheet around. It's possible to use Excel for just about
anything and it's hard to not find a use for it. With its ability to
import databases and allow you to edit them quickly, it makes sense
to have Excel in your business arsenal.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Access:</B> Access is the power users database. Definitely not
something to store your mother's favorite cookie recipes in. Access
is big, tough, and burly, and comparing it with most other database
applications isn't possible since it's above and beyond much of
what's currently on the market. Not very easy to use, but for sheer
power it's a tough one to beat.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>PowerPoint:</B> Viola, instant presentations. PowerPoint takes
the fairly unpleasant task of creating overhead transparencies,
slides, and presentation flyers, and makes it almost fun to do. The
automated wizards can create a presentation complete with slides and
fliers in a few short minutes by asking the user a few simple
questions. The newly released PowerPoint player (free to download
from Microsoft's Web site) allows those who don't have a copy of
PowerPoint on their own PC to view your presentations on their own
systems.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The home user may find the business oriented nature (and the price
tag) of Microsoft Office to be a bit more than they need. For the
home user and the small business owner, there's no need to fret,
Microsoft also has a suite for you. Microsoft Works is a collection
of applications much like those contained in Office, but a bit more
watered down so as to be easier to use and much friendlier. Works
contains a spreadsheet, database, word-processor and a communications
application all in one neatly wrapped package.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The word-processor, although a watered down version of Word, is
still a good product. It allows for a variety of custom formats,
special tools, and has some handy templates which help speed up the
creative process.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The database is probably the most useful feature of Microsoft
Works. Allowing you to create smaller scale (that is small in
comparison to Access) databases and use quick setup wizards to format
the databases for you, this tool can really help out around the house
and the home office. Some of the better wizards that come with it
allow you to create home inventories, gradebooks, and more.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The spreadsheet is a straight-forward, no frills version of Excel.
While nowhere near as powerful, it doesn't suffer from the profusion
of buttons, icons, and arcane commands that reside on the Excel
toolbar.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Lastly, there's the communications application, which is a
slightly modified version of the Terminal application that comes with
the Windows 3.1x package. The modem setup is by far easier than in
many other connectivity applications, and the program as a whole is
quite friendly. For basic communications such as dialing up Bulletin
Board Services it's a welcome addition.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>For the small office, Microsoft Works is more than able, but for a
larger office, or a very busy office, the Microsoft Office suite
should definitely be considered. The prices are radically different
(Works can often be found around $100, whereas the full Office Suite
runs well over $500) and this is reflected in the ability of the
software to handle more powerful tasks. Either way, if you go with MS
Works or MS Office, you can't go wrong, both are very useful
additions to anyone's computing toolkit.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#800000">Quake Dosen't Make Me Shake</FONT><p>
<FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#800000">By Bill Franklin</FONT>

<P><HR></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>For a couple of years now gamer have been buzzing about Quake, the
next project on the drawing board from the creators of Doom and
Heretic. It promised to be a program as hot as its cousins, and as
soon as the shareware version of Quake was posted for download this
past summer, players naturally gobbled it up. But all the pre-release
hype may have backfired-Quake isn't as earth-shaking as it surely was
meant to be. One big problem is that is will only run well on a
Pentium, so I am sure that will leave a lot of you out there wanting
to play but not able to do so.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>That's not to say Quake isn't fun to play; it is. But publisher id
Software had gamers expecting another instant classic-and Quake's
shareware version just doesn't deliver. For instance, the game
includes sound effects but no music; Woodstock '94 mud-crawlers Nine
Inch Nails are listed in the credits, so we can only assume the full
retail version (which at press time had no firm release date) will
have an intense soundtrack-but id wasn't talking. And, though rumors
abound that Quake will boast 3-D spatialized sound, the shareware
version doesn't.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Like Doom, Quake has a plot that doesn't much matter-suffice it to
say it involves monsters, explosions, mysterious devices and time
travel. But all of that is just the barest of excuses for what really
counts-the action.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Doom fans will need to get used to some new commands. The
shareware version has no automapping (which lets you press the "Tab"
key to see a map of where you've been and where you're going), and id
says the final version won't have it, either. And you'll have to
learn to open doors in new ways: Regular doors must be touched, while
secret doors must be hit or shot. The space bar, used in the Doom
series to open doors, is now a jumping/surfacing button that serves
Quake's new 3-D effects. It's the 3-D feature that really shakes up
the action in Quake. Most 3-D games are essentially 2-D imitations of
three dimensions; Quake offers a real 3-D environment. Here, you can
move or aim your weapon up, down and all around.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>However, the visual treats make mouse play much more difficult,
since lining up a shot with a mouse requires using the backward-slash
key to aim up or down-good luck moving back and forth to avoid
getting shot at while you're aiming. You'll be better off with a
joystick-although you may need to download a software fix to use it,
depending on the model you have. And I never did get Quake running
for a multiplayer game over a small network or by direct modem
connection; a patch is in the works.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Finally, Quake offers more atmosphere, scarier monsters, and a
great secret "vertical" level (where the world's on its side) that
will have you quaking in your boots. The game may not cause the
seismic shifts that Doom unleashed, but it still registers pretty
high on the Richter scale.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Available as freeware on all major on-line services, or from
<A HREF="http://www.idsoftware.com">http://www.idsoftware.com</A>;
$10 limited version, $55 full version (Windows 95 CD-ROM, DOS CD-ROM)
from id Software, (800) 434-2637, (214) 613-3589.</P>

<P><B>American Museum of Natural History Launches Site on World Wide
Web</B>: <A HREF="http://www.amnh.org">http://www.amnh.org</A></P>

<P>The American Museum of Natural History has launched a site on the
World Wide Web, as part of its ongoing effort to expand its
educational reach and bring its vast resources to the widest possible
public.</P>

<P>The Museum's Web site contains a wide range of material, from
general information on the Museum and its programs to detailed
information on exhibitions, scientific research, and educational
programming.</P>

<P>The Museum's home page includes a brief introduction to its eight
scientific departments, each represented by a Java-enhanced icon.
From here, visitors can move in any direction, according to their
individual interests.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Entrepreneurs Launch Region's First On-line, Automobile
Inventory Catalog: </B>Two of Capital Region's most successful
technology entrepreneurs have joined forces to develop a new venture
that could have a significant impact on the way consumers shop for
automobiles in this region and beyond. Bob Godgart and Mark
Chudzicki, along with Kurt Lozier, have teamed up to start a new
venture, PowerAdz Corporation.</P>

<P>The company today announced "The PowerAdz Automotive Community for
the Capital Region", an on-line market center where consumers and
dealers can search and locate automobiles in the Capital Region by
selecting criteria such as body style, make, year, mileage, cost,
color and more. The on-line market center is located on the Internet
at <A HREF="http://www. PowerAdz.com">http://www. PowerAdz.com</A>.

<P><B>Stuff It: </B>Announcing a novel method for storing data,
scientists at the University of Buffalo claim their data storage
technique will allow a thousand times more data to be stored on a
platter the same size as a regular compact disc. Layering data the
same way pages of a book are layered, the newest twist on storage
technology may be ready for the marketplace in as little as two or
three years.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>You Can't Have Your Cake and Search it Too</B>: Miss King's
Kitchens Inc., creator of "The Original Texas YA-HOO! Cake" requested
a federal judge stop Internet search service Yahoo! from using its
name.</P>

<P>The gourmet cake and cookie seller trademarked its use of the name
in 1989, and now claims that the popular online tool is infringing on
the trademark. "The intent of filing for the injunction isn't to get
them to pay a lot of money, but to get them to stop using our
trademark," said a lawyer for the Sherman, Texas baker.</P>

<P>The other Yahoo said it had no intention of stopping the use of
the logo, or starting the sale of Danishes, Bear Claws, or birthday
cakes.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Net Access in North America Up 50% since '95</B>: In less than
a year, Internet access in the United States and Canada has grown by
50 percent, and more than half of 2,800 users reported using the
Internet for the first time this year, according to a survey released
today by Neilsen Media Research and CommerceNet.</P>

<P>The poll, conducted in March and April, was the second half of the
companies' demographic study, which began last year, of Internet
users. Users surveyed last August were contacted again for this
study, which established categories for longtime and new users.</P>

<P>The survey results make it clear that the Internet is becoming
mainstream, said Asim Abdullah, executive director of CommerceNet, a
consortium of 150 telecommunications companies, Internet service
providers, banks and online services hoping to increase the use of
the Internet for electronic commerce.</P>

<P>About 23 percent of longtime users--those who had accessed the
Internet prior to August 1995--classified themselves as computer
professionals, while among newcomers, just 11 percent put themselves
in that category. About 67 percent of longtime users were male, and
60 percent of the new users were male, according to the survey.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Artist's Collar Changes the Way You Look at Great
Masterpieces</B>: Artist's Collar Neckties is stimulating interest in
great works of art by pulling museum masterpieces off the wall and
putting them around the necks of well-dressed men. The Artist's
Collar website can be found at:
<A HREF="http://www.necktie.com">http://www.necktie.com</A>. It
features neckwear designed by internationally acclaimed artists like
Frank Lloyd Wright, Romero Britto, Henri Matisse and M.C. Escher.
</P>

<P>Unlike an original work of art, these masterpieces are within
reach of the ordinary budget. Prices range from $35.00 to $65.00.

<P><B>Your Tax Dollars Down The Drain Again:</B> A multimillion-
dollar plan by the Internal Revenue Service to allow taxpayers to
file their tax returns via the Internet has been shelved again
because of a critical report by the General Accounting Office this
week.</P>

<P>The service, called Cyberfile, promises to save time and money for
taxpayers by submitting tax forms through the Net. Cyberfile was set
for release early this year, and was already delayed once due to
security problems.</P>

<P>Now the problems are worse, GAO officials said. The GAO sent a
report to Capitol Hill Monday, which said that Cyberfile was
unreliable. The GAO held a similar hearing about the plan in March.
</P>

<P>"We testified that the system was not built adequately," said a
GAO official, who asked not to be named. "The software the IRS
developed was undisciplined. They didn't adequately consider security
requirements."</P>

<P>The IRS says the plan has been "sidetracked" and will be available
when various issues, including security, are resolved.</P>

<P>IRS officials in Washington declined comment on the GAO's
allegations.</P>

<P><B>Authorworks Fiction Database on the Internet</B>: Authorworks
Publishing announced a new and innovative service for authors of
published and unpublished fiction works.</P>

<P>The Authorworks Fiction Database allows authors to list their
works for review by book publishers, editors and agents worldwide who
visit the Web site.</P>

<P>Authors will have the opportunity to give their work the exposure
it needs. It may be a perfect match for several editors needs, but
they would never know unless the author queries them directly,
contacts them through an agent (if represented) or they find the work
listed in the Authorworks Fiction Database.</P>

<P>The author's cost for a one year listing is very low: $30 for the
first three works and $10 for each additional submission.</P>

<P><B>Microsoft's Ezine "Slate" Already The Subject Of Parody:</B>
Slate...Tales...Stale. A group of New York free-lance writers played
with the letters and came up with a parody of Microsoft's online
magazine that even Editor Michael Kinsley says is dead-on.</P>

<P>A one-shot webzine, Stale, in the words of creator Daniel Radosh,
skewering the lofty, much-maligned tone that Kinsley has tried to
adopt since heading west to launch Slate.</P>

<P>"They come off as saying that they're on a mission to civilize the
Web, as if they're the only ones who can make it safe for America,"
said Radosh, 27.</P>

<P>Stale features an almost picture-perfect parody of Slate,
reminiscent of the Harvard Lampoon magazine take-offs of the early
1980s. Skipping back and forth between the two webzines, it's
sometimes hard to tell which is which -- though the line "Join us or
die," in Stale is something of a reminder.</P>

<P>An almost article-by-article parody, Stale is peppered with digs
at Microsoft ("Can a giant software company put out a magazine that
is free to think for itself? All we can say is, 'Resistance is
futile. You will be assimilated,") Seattle ("For those us of stranded
here in flannel land, rewriting stories that originated from the East
Coast gives us a much-needed sense of importance,") and Slate's own
attitude ("Stale is not the first "webzine," but it is the first that
feels the need to put words like "webzine" in quotes.")</P>

<P>Radosh and his partner in crime, Michael Tritter, got the idea
three weeks ago when they were perusing Slate and ran across a note
that one anagram for Slate was Stale.</P>

<P>"That hit me and I e-mailed Michael and we were on it the next
day," Radosh said.</P>

<P>Freelance writers in the New York Web scene, the duo called ten
friends. Working in their off-hours, they put Stale together in about
two and a half weeks.</P>

<P>The very basis of the Web itself -- hypertext -- adds something
new to the parody genre. At the bottom of a particularly effective
re-write of Kinsley's own introduction to Slate are the words "Still
confused? See how another editor introduced his webzine."</P>

<P>Click on the highlighted words and the reader is jumped directly
to the Slate article being parodied.</P>

<P>"In a sense, I think we make better use of the World Wide Web than
Slate itself does," Tritter, 26, said.</P>

<P>Slate editor Michael Kinsley deemed Stale "very well done."</P>

<P>"Here we've been publishing for about a month and there's this
very detailed parody. It's incredibly flattering," the former
"Crossfire" combatant said from his office in Redmond.</P>

<P>In an aside that perhaps more than anything shows up the
generational nature of the split between the two 'zines, the
45-year-old Kinsley said he realized he had a connection to his
parodist.</P>

<P>"Daniel Radosh? I know his father, Ronald Radosh, the Washington
writer. I've published and edited him."</P>

<P>"Oh, God," was the younger Radosh's only response when alerted to
the connection.</P>

<P><B>New Game Combines Conspiracy with Adventure: </B>What do the
Ark of the Covenant, the Roswell alien autopsy, and JFK's
assassination have in common? Everything in the world, according to
one of Inscape's latest titles. Drowned God, recently demonstrated in
San Francisco by Inscape, has a story line that combines the cynical,
hard-edged conspiracy theory of an Oliver Stone film with the more
fantastical adventures of an Indiana Jones movie. As the protagonist,
your save-the-world quest takes you through four different realms and
into the heart of a 50,000-year-old alien conspiracy. As you begin to
unravel this web of intrigue--through the use of tarot cards and the
solving of Myst-like logic puzzles--you'll begin to piece together
the true origins of humankind and get to the bottom of such mysteries
as the Philadelphia Experiment and the JFK killing. Drowned God is
scheduled to be released for Windows 3.1, Windows 95, and Macintosh
at the end of the year.</P>

<P><B>Java Bugs Hit Explorer 3.0: </B>Microsoft's Internet Explorer
3.0 browser contains several Java bugs that can cause certain applets
to stop working, Microsoft officials acknowledged this week.</P>

<P>Although Microsoft emphasized that the problems are rare, the
latest bugs cap several weeks of reports of software glitches in
Internet Explorer 3.0, as well as Netscape Communications' competing
Navigator 3.0 browser. The problems also highlight the increasing
difficulty encountered by companies in removing bugs from their
browsers as the pace of Net development accelerates.</P>

<P>Today, Microsoft confirmed the existence of two unrelated bugs in
Internet Explorer 3.0's Java engine and said it is working to repair
the problems.</P>

<P>One bug affects the the just-in-time compiler in the browser and
Microsoft's Visual J++ Java development tool. It could require that
the JIT compiler, which speeds up the performance of applets, be
disabled to allow Java programs to run, said Mike Smith, a product
manager at Microsoft.</P>

<P>A second bug involves Internet Explorer's Java "zip" class
libraries and could break applets altogether, though it only affects
users of the beta version of Visual J++ who have upgraded to the
final version of Internet Explorer 3.0, Smith said.</P>

<P>Most of the bugs were first made public by users on Usenet
discussion groups dedicated to Web browsers and Java.</P>

<P>Earlier last month, Microsoft raced to patch several Internet
Explorer 3.0 bugs not related to Java, including a security hole and
a glitch that caused the browser to forget a user's name and
password. Microsoft has posted a single patch for both problems on
its Web site, but it has not devised a plan yet for fixing the latest
Java bugs.</P>

<P>In the meantime, Microsoft officials said most of the Internet
Explorer problems are isolated incidents and not part of an epidemic.
</P>

<P>"It's very easy to lose perspective on Usenet," Smith said. "The
number of people who are complaining are a very vocal but small
group."</P>

<P>In mid-August, a beta version of Netscape Navigator 3.0 was also
beset by a Java bug, which the company said it fixed in the final
version of the browser.</P>

<P><B>New Plan Proposed for Global Domain Registries</B>: The

<P><B>Browser Battles, Cont:</B> Microsoft has responded to
Netscape's allegations that it engages in unfair, anticompetitive
business practices in promoting use of its Internet Explorer browser
software. In a statement issued Aug. 22, Microsoft refuted Netscape's
contentions, point by point, summing up its arguments by saying that
Netscape's "suggestion that Microsoft is somehow violating the
antitrust laws" by incorporating "new features and functionality
(such as Internet Explorer and Internet Information Server) ... is
preposterous." Instead, it maintains that "Microsoft's progress is
the result of hard work, product improvement, mutually beneficial
partnerships and creative marketing." (BNA Daily Report for

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#0000AF">American Heritage Multimedia History of the
Civil War</FONT>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000af">By D.J. Haynes</FONT>

<P><HR></P>

<P>When it was first published back in the early 1960s, The American
Heritage Pictorial History of the Civil War inspired many a budding
historian's fascination with the most divisive period in U.S. history
(including myself). I can remember wanting to know everything about
this most tragic of our nation's wars; when brother fought brother
and families were torn apart over the issues of state's rights.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Now, more than 30 years later, the multimedia update of this
eminent reference work is poised to reach a new generation--the
two-disc set includes hundreds of paintings, contemporary photos and
maps, and the prose of Pulitzer Prize- winning author Bruce Catton.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Greatfully, the program does more than just resurrect a great book
into a multimedia program. In the new context, Catton's words are
ably supported by an hour of audio and video clips, including
dramatic battle reenactments, interviews with historians, and actors
in period dress.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Unlike many other Civil War programs, this presentation doesn't
focus solely on military manuevers. One of the two discs deals with
the battles and leaders of the war; the other looks at the big
picture, including the art of the period, more than a dozen
contemporary songs, and excerpts from literature written during and
about the war, including selections from Uncle Tom's Cabin and The
Red Badge of Courage.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The package's only weak link is a confusing and somewhat boring
strategy game that challenges users to "change history" by playing
the role of either the North or the South. The game isn't much fun
and is out of place within an otherwise very nice program.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The program is a nicely priced $54.95 (Windows 3.1 CD-ROM) from
Byron Press Multimedia, (800) 945-3155, (212) 989-6252,
http://www.byronpress.com.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>For those interested in Civil War simulations, Sierra has just
come out with "Robert E. Lee Civil War General" and Interactive Magic
has "The American Civil War". Both programs have strengths and
weaknesses, but for the most part are good solid Civil War
simulations. Look for reviews of these programs in a future issue.

<P><HR></P>

<P>So you've finally done it. You heard all about the "information
revolution" and you went out and bought a new PC. You've invested
anywhere from several hundred to a few thousand dollars on a shiny
new system with a bit-burning ultra-fast processor, high speed CD
ROM, lots of RAM and more hard drive space than your house has closet
space. Now, the beige lump of plastic is staring you right in the eye
and your relatives are cheering your entrance into the world of
computing, and you're left wondering"Now what do I do with this
thing."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Go ahead and admit it, you were talked into buying a PC and now
you're wondering if you really needed one. Every day you stare at
that beautiful SuperVGA monitor and wonder why you paid so much money
for something you use so little. It's understandable, and it happens
to plenty of people. But let's not worry about the possibility that
you just wasted a good deal of cash, instead, let's see if we can
make that lump of plastic and wires work for you. Computers have
plenty of good uses, let's take a look at some of them.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Home Offices:</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>If you're like many of the folks joining the home business
revolution, you'll need a PC. A computer in your home office is as
necessary as a phone these days. Some of the best applications of a
PC are in the home office. For example:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Bookkeeping is much more accurate when you take time on a computer
to do it. Records stay close by (on your hard drive) thus making them
more accessible. And a computer is going to do complex math better
and faster than you could hope to using both your fingers and toes to
count.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Word-processors and desktop publishing applications allow you to
create flyers, advertisements, letterheads, complex documents and
catalogs less expensively than if you had an agency or printing house
prepare them.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Presentations and overheads can be quickly and easily generated in
specialized presentation applications. So the next time you go into a
meeting with a prospective client, you'll have eye catching
professional quality graphs, charts, and slide shows instead of some
dull typewritten pages and simple black and white graphs.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Communicating with clients becomes a simple matter of point and
click when you've got a PC connected to an Internet provider or
electronic mail (email) service. Some companies are even giving away
free email accounts. Email allows you to send messages and files in
less time than it takes to fax them.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Cutting time when setting up package pickups is a definite plus
for someone running a home office. Forget calling the delivery
service to come pick up your packages. Parcels can be prepared for
shipping, tagged , and a pickup order can be placed by going online
to the delivery agency's electronic service. Some even allow you to
print your own perfectly useable shipping labels. You can hook up
with the service, order a delivery, and have them waiting to pickup
at your door with a few mouse-clicks.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Home users reap the same rewards as home business users. But
there's a few added advantages.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>PC's are great educational tools when used properly. Children
learn quickly on computers and are usually very interested in the
electronic world. Educational games, puzzles, online services and
more can help you augment your child's traditional schooling. With CD
ROMS containing as much information as an entire wall full of
encyclopedias it makes sense to use a PC as an educational tool.
Children enjoy CD ROM encyclopedias especially for their multimedia
content allowing children to see and hear about the subjects they are
studying.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Communications, as I have mentioned in the home business section,
are greatly enhanced. Family members can quickly and easily send
email to one another from just about anywhere in the world. Email,
being quick and cheap, is an intelligent alternative to the telephone
system, which charges by the minute, whereas Internet services
generally just charge a flat rate. With the amount of money some
families spend on a few hours of long distance phone time per month,
they could send potentially unlimited volumes of email to one
another. With traditional letter writing on the decline, email offers
a quick and easy method of keeping in touch with family.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Research becomes easier and more accessible. If you've ever spent
what felt like too many hours in a library poring over old books,
then a PC may something to seriously consider investing in. As
mentioned in the children's education section, PC CD-ROM
encyclopedias contain full text, video, and film clips. The Internet
is rapidly expanding the amount of reliable information provided at
various web sites, thus making "web surfing" an educational
experience as well as an entertaining one.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Entertaining the family takes on a new dimension with a PC.
Computer games, online services, and many more diversions are
available with a home computer. Some newer PC's look more like a
Television than a home computer. Manufacturers have taken to creating
a computer that's meant to appear as part of the everyday home, than
being a high tech toy.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Taxes and personal finances are simplified when you're using a PC
to keep track. Some of the newer tax applications actually make
suggestions on improving your returns and the financial applications
go a long way towards keeping your household budget in order. Two
more great uses for a PC are electronic banking and stock trading.
Many banks are allowing users to download account info from their
bank to their financial software for a modest monthly fee. Brokerage
houses are going electronic with the advent of computerized trading
programs that let you do the wheeling and dealing online while
keeping track of your stocks, bonds and mutual funds.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Personal computers have come a long way from the days of being
useful only to the techno-literate, so if you've got one already
don't feel overwhelmed by it, instead take the time to learn how it
works and put it to good use. And if you're considering buying one,
make sure you have a need for it before you spend the money on one.

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#D6D600">Home Office Tips</FONT>
<p>
<FONT size=5 COLOR="#D6D600">By A. Accetta</FONT>

<P><HR></P>

<P>An old Rolling Stones' song used to say, "time waits for no man" (or women in this world of
political correctness) and that is so true when you have your own business, especially one
that operates from a home office. Your business makes so many demands
that time has become an adversary. Even when you burn the midnight
oil and spend weekends locked in your office, it seems impossible to
get everything done; not to mention finding time to spend with your
family and do all of the chores around the house.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Technology can come to the rescue and get some of that precious
time back for you. You may think you're using technology to its
maximum timesaving capacity, but there's always room for improvement.
Here are 11 simple techniques that can liberate precious minutes from
your day and hours from your week. Judging from our estimates, these
ideas could add up to an entire extra day for work or play (hopefully
you'll chose play)..</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>When you think about it, it's the administrative tasks that so
subtly nibble away at your day. You need to call clients to schedule
meetings. You have to address envelopes for marketing mail. You need
to send out the monthly billing statements.</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>1. Make use of your computer as a tool to schedule meetings
via</I> <I>e-mail instead of phone.</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>You need to schedule meetings with multiple clients, but you don't
want to waste the entire day doing it. Even if you did, chances are
you wouldn't get everyone the first try, and wind up leaving a
message on their machines. The solution: Send your messages via
e-mail. It may seem a little impersonal compared with a phone call,
but the people you're contacting just as busy as you are and would
likely appreciate one less interruption in their day also.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>E-mail has numerous advantages over the telephone. Its main plus
is its speed. E-mail's one-sided nature means you say your piece,
then send it off. The response comes, and you're done. There's no
time-consuming chit-chat to endure, no games of phone tag to play.
The one drawback is the lack of instant feedback. Not everyone may
check their e-mail every day so it might take a day or two to get a
response. The solution: Plan ahead. Schedule meetings and announce
them a week in advance, thus giving your clients time to answer and
you time to make any necessary scheduling adjustments.</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>2. Merge the mail: Use your PC--rather than your pen--to
address envelopes.</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Most likely, you've already got your clients' names and addresses
in a database, so why not use your word processor's mail-merge
feature to address envelopes? Even if your printer requires you to
feed envelopes one at a time, you'll still crank out more in half an
hour than you could by hand.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>You may have to invest some time to learn and set up the
mail-merge process, but that's a onetime chore. Both Word Perfect and
Microsoft Word have fairly easy mail-merge macros that makes doing a
mailing a real snap.</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>3. Send faxes from your PC rather than a fax machine.</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Although fax machines have been part of our business lives for
more than a decade, the technology behind them has changed very
little. Most machines still transmit pages at a pokey 9,600 bits per
second (bps). A computer modem, on the other hand, can send and
receive at 14,400bps--as long as there's another computer at the
other end with the same speed modem.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Even if you're sending a document from your computer to a regular
fax machine, there's time to be saved. For one thing, you won't have
to watch over the computer to make sure pages feed properly. (There's
no such thing as a paper jam when you fax via modem.) Plus, you won't
need to print documents before sending them. And if it's a
long-distance fax, you'll pinch a few pennies as well. Ok, there is
one drawback, you can't fax something that isn't in your computer
-unless you have a scanner, but then that old time factor comes into
effect again. But, there are some pluses to owning a scanner as
number 4 below will attest to.</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>4. Make your copies at home.</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Even if there's a copy shop just 10 minutes from your office, you
still have to get in the car, drive there, find a parking space, make
the copies, and drive home. If you're doing a big job that requires
collating or stapling, you might have no other choice then to out
source the job, but for making a few copies here and there, stay
home. You don't need a photocopier--all you need is a scanner.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There's a new breed of affordable priced personal scanners on the
market and many--such as Visioneer's PaperPort and Logitech's
PageScan Color--come with software that enables push-button copying.
Simply feed a few pages into the scanner, and in seconds your printer
will begin churning out duplicates.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Of course, you could also just buy one of those small desktop
copiers and it might work as well as a scanner. My experience with
them in the past was not very good. I had problems with the toner
(very messy) and also the quality of the paper. This was however a
few years ago and like most things, the product may have improved
with age.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The best thing to do is go to your local dealer and pick the
brains of the salesperson on what is best for you.</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>5. Order supplies online instead of going to the store.</I>
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Proponents of the virtual marketplace tout the convenience of
shopping online versus fighting traffic and surly salespeople.
Although you can't try on a new outfit while sitting at your PC,
there's no reason you shouldn't shop in cyberspace for such staples
as, well, staples.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>If you subscribe to America Online or have access to the World
Wide Web, you can browse the shelves of OfficeMax OnLine
(<A HREF="http://www.office max.com">http://www.office max.com</A>)
and order whatever supplies you need--at any time of the day or
night. Instead of wandering endless aisles in search of bulletin
boards, copy paper, and ink-jet cartridges, then standing in line and
getting home, you can use its Product Search tool to toss exactly
what you need into your virtual shopping cart.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Of course, you'll have to wait a few days for the supplies to
reach your doorstep, and you'll pay a couple bucks extra for
shipping. But the time saved is well worth planning a few days ahead.
</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>6. Another use for that scanner</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Use optical character recognition (OCR) to convert physical
documents to computer text instead of retyping them. The technology
behind OCR may not be perfect (even the best programs fall short of
100 percent accuracy), but it's still significantly faster than
typing. Even if you type 60 words per minute, you can save gobs of
time by letting the computer take the reins. Suppose a client faxes
you a 10-page document that you need to revise and fax back. You can
spend over an hour typing it into your word processor, or you can
import it into a program such as Caere's OmniPage Pro. In both cases,
you'll have to spot-edit the document for mistakes, but you'll get to
that step a lot quicker with OmniPage. (You can also use a scanner to
import documents for OCR.)</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>7. Use the Internet for research.</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Looking for the latest tax information as it pertains to small
business? You can spend hours combing the stacks of your local
library or hop into cyberspace for up-to-the-minute data directly
from the IRS. The agency's surprisingly stylish Web site
http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/ offers forms, information, and even
humor.</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>8. Get technical support electronically rather than by
phone.</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>For most of us, technical support is a necessary evil, like root
canals and Schedule Cs. Waiting on hold for 20 minutes while Yanni
burbles in our ear is not my idea of time well spent. But when your
PC starts to act like it's ready to blow, what else can you do?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Send an e-mail or post a message to an online bulletin board.
Virtually all computer companies now offer these electronic solutions
as alternatives to phone support. Unless your problem requires
immediate attention (Windows won't load, your CD-ROM drive is
smoking, and so on), you can fire off a quick note to the company,
then check back the next day for the response.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>If the company has a message area on America Online or CompuServe,
you can peruse the postings to see if anyone else has experienced
your problem--and find out what the solution is. I called the
technical support lines of five major computer companies and waited
on hold for an average of 17 minutes. I also sent e-mail or posted
messages online. In every case of the latter, I received a response
within 24 hours.</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>9. Use a tape drive rather than floppies to back up your hard
drive.</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>A large-capacity tape backup drive can be yours for as little as
$150, and it'll increase your peace of mind at the same time that it
frees up your schedule.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The backup utility included with Windows 95 allows you to archive
your data on floppy disks--provided you're willing to sit there and
swap them. Backing up an entire hard drive this way is just plain
silly. But even if you're archiving just 30MB of vital data, the
floppy-swap system is a poor choice.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Using a tape drive doesn't necessarily complete the process much
faster, but it has one distinct advantage: You can start the backup
at night, and it'll be done in the morning. Because the tape backup
drive requires no supervision, you need only spend the time it takes
to select which files to back up.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Of course you could also spend a few more bucks and buy one of
those nifty zip drives or other zip-type drives that are now on the
market. They work faster than a tape drive and you can use them as
portable hard drives. If you need the ability to transfer large
amounts of data between computers then the extra feature of acting as
a portable hard drive may justify the additional cost over buying a
tape drive</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>10. Fine-Tune your system for maximum performance. </I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Here's a list of ways you can rev up that monster on your desk.
</P>

<P>* Give the 14.4Kbps modem the boot and buy a 28.8Kbps modem for
under $200.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>* Add eight more megabytes of RAM to your system. Available now
for as little as $90, it will make your applications run faster.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>*Put your most used applications onto your desktop start-up group
so it immediately launches programs when you turn on your PC.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>*Upgrade your 486 or lower-speed Pentium to a Pentium with an
Intel Pentium overdrive processor. Intel is now selling Pentium CPU
upgrades for 486-based systems (prices range from $159 to $219).
Upgrades to 120- and 133MHz from 60- and 75MHz systems, respectively,
cost $299. At press time, upgrading your system to 166MHz from 100MHz
costs $679 (still far less expensive than buying a new system).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>*Create macros in your word processor using Microsoft Word's
AutoText Feature and instantly add a logo, salutation, or closing
with a keystroke.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>*Design a template with your business letterhead. If you have a
scanner, or access to one, scan in your signature and save it onto
the template as a bitmap file. You're now equipped to bypass your
printer and fax machines and fax signed documents directly from your
PC.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>11. Color can equal profit</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>With today's color ink-jet printers you can do a great deal of the
work that used to have to be sent to a service bureau for
preparation. Epson, Canon and HP all make color ink-jets that offer
between 600-720 dpi resolution and super color reproduction, making
them perfect for creating spot-color proofs and mock-ups of designs.
I have even used the Epson Stylus Color to print 720 dpi color
separations that were used for print work.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>You will still need the service bureau for things like out-put to
film and slides, but give the printer manufacturers time and they'll
come up with an inexpensive way to do that on a desktop ink-jet or
low-cost laser as well.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Now my only concern is that you don't feel like you've wasted your
time reading this article. Hopefully everyone will get some idea here
to save time and then implement it in their daily routine.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#DC143C">Family Medical Guides Reviewed</FONT><p>

<FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#DC143C">D.J. Haynes</FONT>

<P><HR></P>

<P>When it comes to medical reference guides, CD-ROMs are just what
the doctor ordered. What better format is there for technical terms
that require lengthy explanations? And was a topic ever more ripe for
illustrations and video, from pictures of skeletons, muscles and the
parts of the brain to animation revealing how the heart and lungs
work?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>That said, it takes creative programming to present the basic
facts and figures gracefully. Used well, a computer's interactivity
can lead to a disc that gives the subject life, and it's nice to see
both Mayo Clinic Family Health and the American Medical Association
Family Medical Guide rise to the challenge: Each offers information
in a way that lets you interact on a personal level, as if you were
talking privately to your own doctor.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>At their core, both discs let you identify symptoms of a medical
condition and, after answering a few questions, zero in on possible
causes. For instance, suppose your child has developed a cough. The
AMA Guide asks, "Is your child's temperature 100 or above?" If you
select Yes, it asks, "Is your child breathing very rapidly or gasping
for air?" Answer No, and the program responds, "This may be a viral
respiratory infection such as influenza"; answer Yes, and it advises,
"Call your physician now--your child may have a lung infection. See
'acute bronchitis' or 'pneumonia in children.'" The Mayo Clinic disc
reaches similar conclusions, listing among the possible causes
bronchiolitis, a cold and croup; it then supplies background
information on each.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The AMA disc gets higher marks for presentation, especially for
its attractive on-screen flow charts that help you follow all the
alternatives. In contrast, while the Mayo Clinic disc dishes out
similar substance, it does so in a less interesting, text-based
Q&amp;A style.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>But the Mayo disc boasts a healthier store of information. Ask it
about hyperthyroidism, for instance, and you'll get 312 single-spaced
pages of text, with dozens of hyperlinked sidebars on everything from
Graves' Disease and goiters to atrial fibrillation and iodized salt.
The same subject gets only two pages in the AMA disc, with no
hyperlinked references. On the other hand, some may find the AMA's
friendlier, less formal text easier to understand.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Another advantage of the Mayo disc is its inclusion of a few
extras. Along with a poison guide and a drugs and prescription
section, the disc includes a personal history option for notes on
your family's medical episodes. You also get a collection of animated
sequences on potentially helpful and occasionally sensitive subjects
such as how to perform the Heimlich maneuver, how to manipulate ear
drops and how to use a suppository.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Of course, neither disc is meant to take the place of a
physician--repeatedly, both discs advise you to see your doctor in
serious cases. But you may feel better just knowing either program is
in the house.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#0000AF">Corel WordPerfect Suite 7 for Windows
95</FONT><p>

<H3><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000AF">Robert Penny</FONT>

<P><HR></P>

<P>This 32-bit version of the very nice Corel WordPerfect Suite for
Windows 3x puts the Internet to work while tightly integrating Corel
WordPerfect 7, Corel Quattro Pro 7, and Corel Presentations 7. Corel
WordPerfect Suite 7 takes advantage of Windows 95 with 32-bit
applications and enables users to finish faster and work smarter with
improved output.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<b></b>
<P>"Corel WordPerfect Suite 7 for Windows 95 nicely integrates
graphics and Internet power as well as standard office applications.
Feature for feature, this new Corel Suite outperforms other office
suites such as Microsoft Office. Corel WordPerfect Suite 7 for
Windows 95 includes the following full-featured applications:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>* Corel WordPerfect 7: I have always liked Word Perfect more than
MS Word and this new version makles me even more a WP supporter.
Innovative key features such as Guidelines, Make It Fit and
Spell-As-You-Go as well as Internet capabilities, continue to make
this the word processor of choice.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>* Corel Quattro Pro 7: This award-winning spreadsheet contains new
chart styles, a new mapping feature, QuickTemplates, Internet
connectivity, and right mouse-button support for fast access to
formatting options.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>* Corel Presentations 7: This presentations graphics program
includes the ability to move from a slide to an Internet site or to
other slides with a single click, as well as the ability to convert
slide shows to HTML format, and the option to combine multiple
backgrounds, graphics, text, video and sound within one presentation.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>* Envoy 7: The perfect workgroup electronic publishing tool for
CD-ROM and the Internet.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>* AT&amp;T's WorldNet Service software including Netscape
Navigator 2.01 Internet Browser: Obtain access to the Internet with a
premium service provider and best-of-breed Internet browser. O.K., I
have to admit that I don't like AT&amp;T WorldNet Service. I tried it
and had many problems with connection speeds, time outs and
disconnection from the system. It's included with the program but you
don't have to use it.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>* CorelFLOW 3: Powerful business graphics. Nice templates and a
good collection of clipart.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>* Starfish Software's Sidekick 95: This is one of the most popular
personal information manager and scheduler out there. I however, have
never had a use for one of these, so I was not impressed with it..
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>* Starfish Software's Dashboard 95: Integrated application and
task-automation launcher, as well as a Windows 95 system performance
monitor. His again is something I never use and as such, to me just
additional disk space being taken up. Of course, you don't have to
load it if you do a custom installation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>* QuickView Plus: View over 200 file formats quickly and easily.
This is nice for viewing graphics and files from other word
processing programs.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>* IBM VoiceType Control: Use a microphone and your voice to
navigate and activate each core application's graphic user interface.
I found it easier just to use keystrokes rather than go through the
whole process of voice activation. Plus I didn't want to give up the
disk space for this program.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>* The program comes with 150 fonts. You'll never use all of these
and they will take up valuable real estate on your hard drive. Look
through the list and just install the ones you think you'll use.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>* The program comes with a wopping 10,000+ clip art images for use
in flyers, letters and other presentations. Corel has always been
strong in the clip art department and this part of the program really
shines.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Corel WordPerfect Suite 7 for Windows 95 makes the most of 32-bit
power with more core application integration (Corel WordPerfect 7,
Corel Quattro Pro 7, and Corel Presentations 7) than any other suite.
All Corel WordPerfect Suite 7 core applications offer performance
improvements and increased multi-tasking--plus features like:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>* File/macro conversion</P>

<P>* Common address book</P>

<P>* Integrated Speller, Grammatik and Thesaurus</P>

<P>* Simultaneous task performance with multi-tasking support</P>

<P>* Simultaneous program function with multi-threading support</P>

<P>* Long file name support, tabbed dialogs and drag and drop</P>

<P>* Drag and drop to task bar</P>

<P>* Extensive right mouse button support</P>

<P>* File and property viewing from desktop</P>

<P>* An Open dialog with much functionality than Windows Explorer
</P>

<P>*QuickFinder indexing technology integration into Windows 95 shell
</P>

<P>*View over 200 file formats from the Windows 95 shell with
QuickView</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>All are integrated with full OLE 2 and OLE automation support as
well as support for the Windows 95 registry.</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P><I>Putting the Internet to Work</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The program offers access to the Internet with AT&amp;T's WorldNet
Service software including Netscape Navigator 2.01 Internet Browser.
Online assistance is available directly from the Help menus in any
application with one click. I didn't try it, but I am assuming that
you could also use another provider and integrate the features into
that connection as well.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Internet features include:</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>*Link information directly to Corel WordPerfect Suite 7 documents
through URL cell support.</P>

<P>* Import and export to and from HTML in Corel WordPerfect 7, Corel
Quattro Pro 7 and Corel Presentations 7.</P>

<P>*Envoy 7 electronic publishing solution for sharing Internet
documents with all fonts, graphics and formatting intact.</P>

<P>*QuickConnect instantly connects users to Bookmarks in Netscape
Navigator 2.01 or favorite places in America Online, CompuServe or
Microsoft Network.</P>

<P>*Envoy 7 document viewing directly from Internet browser.</P>

<P>*Create web-ready Corel WordPerfect documents that can be directly
exported to HTML.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Customer Support is great with Corel. They are one of the only
software vendors to offer free, unlimited technical support (toll
charges apply) for the life of the product. The life of the product
is defined as the time period commencing when Corel last introduced
the product until 6 months after Corel stops selling the product.

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#AF0000">Claris Home Page</FONT><p>
<FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#AF0000">By A. Accetta</FONT>

<P><HR></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>As a web page designer I am getting pretty tired of all of the new
"build your own web site in the blink of an eye" software on the
market. It is definitely cutting into the business by making it
easier and easier for the laymen to create their own web presence.
Sure the large business owner probably won't use this type of
software, but the bulk of many web designer's business is the little
guy wanting to get on the net. These type of businesses usually have
a small budget and as such programs like Claris cater to them. With
my complaints said, lets talk about this new program.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Claris Home Page software, is an easy-to-use web authoring program
that is designed for both novices and experienced users. It is
available for both Macintosh and Windows users at an estimated retail
price of $99. As an added bonus, all Claris Home Page purchasers will
receive a coupon good for up to six months of free web hosting for
their web pages (at a site of Claris's choosing).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So what's so great about Claris Home page anyway. Well. It is
among the first web authoring solutions that truly demystifies web
authoring by not requiring HTML coding expertise, placing web page
creation directly into the hands of the user.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The program offers a powerful set of technical breakthroughs and
features long in demand by users but not available until now. Unique
to Claris Home Page is the combination of many powerful tools that
helps developers and more advanced users create, edit and view web
pages, all from one application.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>These key features include:</B></P>

<P>*One-stop HTML editing within Claris Home Page - All editing,
including raw HTML code editing, is done within Claris Home Page - no
need to launch other HTML editing applications. Also, a Find and
Replace function speeds updating time.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>*Frames - Create frame layouts that bring multiple web pages
together into one page, enabling easy development of dynamic web
sites in just a few mouse clicks.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>*Libraries - Store frequently used text, images and HTML code -
all of which can easily be dragged and dropped from the Claris Home
Page Library.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>If the library object has a special URL or links to another web
object or document, those links stay "live" when the object is put on
the new web page. Like Frames, objects generate raw HTML code for
customization and editing.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>*Tables - The Table Editor lets users easily create tables of
different column and row sizes in seconds.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>*Web graphics - It comes with over 500 graphic images. Most of
these are your standard backgrounds, buttons, bars etc. Nothing to
write home about here.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>*Document Statistics Page - Provides web page creators with
estimated download times for objects and/or entire pages for 14.4 and
28.8Kbps modems to help authors make feasible decisions on their
usage of graphics.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>*Comprehensive Tool Bar or Floating Tool Bar Palette - Users
choose how they wish to access the Tool Bar, which provides easy page
generation, comprehensive text formatting, images, rules, links and
anchors.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>*Browser Preview - Gives web authors a quick preview of their web
page as it will appear on in their browser.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>*Customizable - Specify line breaks, tag styles and other
attributes in the final HTML file.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>*Free Web hosting service - Users receive a coupon enabling them
to choose 6 months basic speed (28.8 Kbps) or 3 months of high speed
(56 or faster Kbps) free web hosting via HoloNet. (This offer is good
until June, 1997). The web hosting service is subject to HoloWWW
terms and conditions.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>*Advanced user features - Seasoned users can also develop dynamic,
interactive sites that call applets (using Java or JavaScript) and
CGI applications.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Claris Home Page for Macintosh requires a Mac or Power Mac with a
68020 processor or higher; 8MB memory; System: 7.1 or later; and 2MB
free for minimum installation (6MB for full installation). For
Windows users, Claris Home Page requires an Intel 486 or higher
compatible PC System; Win 95 or Win NT 3.5.1 or newer; 8MB RAM (16MB
for NT) and 4MB free hard disk space.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Claris Home Page costs $99. Users of competitive web authoring
software applications, such as Adobe PageMill, HoTMetal Pro,
Microsoft FrontPage (to be reviewed next month), Netscape Navigator
Gold, Corel WebDesigner 2.0, Quarterdeck WebAuthor, Deltapoint
QuickSite, and InContext Spider qualify for a $20 rebate direct from
Claris with proof of purchase.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>With all these features and an easy to use interface, even I as a
web designer found it to be useful. The ease of creating frames and
integrating cgi programs into a web site make this not only an easy
to use program for the novice or business owner wanting to get on the
web "on the cheap", but also another tool for the web designer to use
in his bag of tricks. So, now that I think about it, Claris Home Page
actually helps to make my job a bit easier and more cost effective
-ie, I can make more money by doing the work in less time.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>If you have little or no desire to learn anything about web pages
and their design, but want to get on the web, then call a web design
firm and have them do it for you. However, if you have a sense of
adventure, and like to go your own way, then Claris Home Page may
just be the ticket to get yourself on the web.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#AF0000">PACIFIC COAST SOFTWARE ANNOUNCES
SITEEDIT PRO</FONT>

<P><HR></P>

<P>SiteEdit Pro expands upon Pacific Coast Software's popular Web
server CGI SiteEdit, which allows remote HTML editing from within any
standard Web browser, and allows multi-user password protected
access, file upload, and an updated interface. SiteEdit Pro will
allow you to specify individual editing capabilities to multiple
users. This feature will let service providers, or webmasters easily
allow their clients restricted access to edit their files. SiteEdit
Pro's password capabilities will easily allow a large number of users
individual access to any folder on your Web server. All
administration is done via a forms based Web interface.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>SiteEdit's ability to edit HTML files will be augmented by the
ability to upload HTML documents, and supporting graphic files, from
within the browser as well. This lets you avoid using FTP for
standard server maintenance. Since you are editing and placing
graphics from within your browser, you can easily view the effects of
your changes instantly.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In addition to editing existing files, SiteEdit Pro will assist
users whowant to create new files. Skeleton HTML templates will speed
the process of creating new Web pages. Even novice HTML authors will
be able to quickly create new pages directly on their server.
Advanced users will appreciate the speed at which server maintenance
is handled.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>SiteEdit Pro is available for Macintosh and Windows Web servers
running any standard server software. A UNIX version will be
available late September. SiteEdit Pro is $179.00. A special
introductory price of $149 will be available until Sept. 30. The
software is available direct from Pacific Coast Software
(619/675-1106) and may purchased conveniently from their Web site
(<A HREF="http://www. pacific-coast.com">http://www.

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#FF8040">Meet Mac Extension Manager</FONT>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#FF8040">By Tif Bailey</FONT>

<P><HR></P>

<P>When applications work at the RAM limits of a Mac, it prompts a
wish for a computer for a specific task. Many applications load
resources when the Mac is started even if the application is not
active. Some of these extensions are represented by the icons that
dance across the screen at start up. Printer drivers for unused
printers need not be loaded. If stand alone games are to be used then
Internet resources can be made inactive. System 7.5 has a control
panel which allows the Mac to be configured for a specific task for a
specific session. It's called the "Extension Manager." The Apple
Guide at the upper right corner of the screen offers introductory
information in the section, "How do I Manage the System Folder
Extension." The most direct way to find it, is to type, "extension"
in the "Look For" search box. There is also a help box once the
control panel for Extension Manager is open.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There are two ways to open the Extension Manager. The first is
double clicking the icon in the control panel folder. The first
window shows a warning, equivalent to "Don't try this at home." The
core system software will not be damaged but behavior could be
changed. The process is friendly enough to allow what is done to be
undone. The box on the right lists all the active extensions by
displaying a check mark next to the title. Clicking and holding the
down arrow on the "sets" box shows three basic configurations; "all
on" or "all off" or "System 7.x." The "all off" might be handy during
loading a new application or trouble shooting a software conflict.
Another way to open the Extension Manger is to hold down the SPACE
key during start-up.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Selecting another combination of extensions, places a default
title of "Custom" in the Sets box. This Custom set will remain active
until changed. Clicking on the "Save Set" allows a set to be given a
name for use at the next start up. For example using the Mac as a
telephone answering or fax machine requires a prompt start up. Saving
a minimum set of extensions for these applications can easily be
accomplished. Taking time to restart before each session can be
annoying so there is a way to invoke the Extension Manager at start
up.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Holding down the SHIFT key at start up will disable all
extensions. This action may be useful for loading new software,
trouble shooting or an emergency situation when extension conflicts
are suspect. Holding down the SPACE key at start up will open the
Extension Manager. At this time the set of extensions wanted for that
particular session can be set or called from a previously saved
group. It's like having a different Mac for each activity.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>A look in the system folder will show two extension folders one
for active extensions and one for disabled extensions. As expected,
Extension Manager moves application files from one folder to the
other according to the check mark status. Clicking and dragging files
in and out of these folders manually can easily confuse the Extension
Manager. This practice is not recommended.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So try using the extension manager, and build a Mac for a special
task at a special session.</P>

<h3><b><center>Great Holiday Gift Ideas</h3></center></h3><p>
<center><img src="redline.gif"></center>
Ah, the holidays are almost upon us. A time to gather with
friends
and family and give and get presents. If you're looking to give
something different this year, besides the always faithful tie
and
sweater, then read on. In the next few pages we'll describe some
cool new software, hardware and other items for holiday gift
giving.<p>

Adding a graphics/sound card is a great way to spiff up a PC and
the Creative Labs 3D Blaster is one of the best there is. This
Plug
and Play graphics card excels at drawing perspective-accurate
texture mapped images so they appear true, and you get rapid-fire
3-D action to boot. To get you started, Creative Labs throws in a
tempting game bundle that includes Magic Carpet Plus, Flight
Unlimited, and Cybersled. Cost: $349 from Creative Labs,
408-428-6600<p>

How about a digital camera? The Chinon ES-3000 lets you snap
full-color digital photos. A 3X zoom lens gets you up close and
personal, while the automatic flash lights your shot when needed.
Images are stored in removable flash cards available in 2MB, 4MB,
8MB, and 16MB capacities. A 2MB card can hold from 10 to 86
images,
depending on resolution, which can range from 640 by 480 with
little compression to a compressed size of 320 by 240. Cost
$1,099 
(a little steep, but hey it's Christmas) form Chinon,
800-441-0222<p>

A nice gift for that special someone in your life might be an
internet account. Contact one of your local providers for
details.
You'll find some ads in this issue with contact numbers. Cost and
services vary by provider, so shop carefully.<p> 


And as a combo gift with that internet account, you might also
purchase a modem. A V34, 28.8baud modem from most any
manufacturer
is what you need for surfing the net. But if money is no object,
then the Motorola BitSurfr is a really nice one. It's a modem for
the next generation. Four times faster than today's fastest
modems,
the BitSurfr uses special digital phone lines (called ISDN) to
push
data at a rate of about 128 kilobits per second. That means
lightning-quick Web updates, breezy multimedia downloads, and
even
full-motion video conferencing (if you own the equipment). Just
make sure your local phone company can provide a digital phone
connection. Cost $375 from Motorola, 800-365-6456<p>

The Sportster Victor DSVD 28.8 fax-modem with DSVD can transmit
voice and data simultaneously over a single analog phone line
(what
most of us have in our houses), so you can engage in chat while
playing games over the modem or while sending a fax to your home
office. It even allows long-distance conferencing. And 28.8 means
quick downloads for big savings in the long run. Cost $389 from
U.S. Robotics, 800-342-5877.<p>

Does the person your buying a gift for have an older PC? Then a
Diamond Ultra Kit 8000 upgrade kit might just put some new life
into that baby. The superquick 8X CD-ROM drive transfers data at
1.2MB per second and boasts an access time of 230ms. Throw in the
wave-table audio card with 3-D sound, and a great software bundle
including Myst, SimCity 2000, and Rebel Assault, and you have one
hot multimedia PC. The one problem with the kit is the lame
3-watt
Yamaha speakers. Cost $549 from Diamond Multimedia,
408-325-7000<p>

A new monitor is always a great gift. Make sure to get at least a
15". A 17" would be even better. When shopping for a monitor
please
note that a new law now requires the monitor manufacturer to
state
what the actual viewing screen size is. Prior to this, a
manufacturer could market a monitor with a big screen as 15" even
though the actual viewing size might have been 13". The new law
makes it easier for the consumer to accurately comparison shop
for
monitors.<p>  

The Logitech TrackMan Marble is a nice 3-button mouse with a
bright
red trackball (just like Rudolph's nose). A sensor embedded in
the
pointing device tracks the movements of dots printed on the ball,
virtually eliminating dust buildup and making the Marble the most
sensitive mouse on the market. Cost $99 from Logitech,
510-795-8500 

Get the most out of your gaming with Microsoft's top-of-the-line
digital joystick. The SideWinder is both sleek and sophisticated.
It can emulate either a Thrustmaster or FlightStick Pro when used
with DOS titles. But the real kick comes with Windows 95 titles,
where the SideWinder's digital design delivers unmatched control
and response. Now all they need are some decent games for Windows
95. Cost $59 from Microsoft, 206-882-8080.<p>

The Sound Blaster AWE32 Plug 'n' Play from Creative Labs is quite
nice. The AWE32 offers 16-bit audio, 3-D sound, wave-table MIDI,
and versatile, easy-to-use recording software. Cost $249 from
Creative Labs, 408-428-6600<p> 

To really experience multimedia, check out Altec Lansing's ACS500
sound system with Dolby Pro-Logic surround sound, the same
technology used in lavish home theater systems. The package
includes two gorgeous tower satellite speakers and a booming
40-watt subwoofer that will envelop you in sound. Cost is a
whopping $399 but worth it if you use your system for any type of
multimedia presentations, or you just want great sound while
playing Doom.<p> 

What gift list would be complete without mentioning the Iomega
Zip
Drive? About the size of a Sony Walkman and just as portable, the
Iomega Zip drive plugs conveniently into a parallel port and
comes
with easy-to-use software for backing up files. Best of all, it
accepts either 25MB ($9.95) or 100MB ($19.95) Zip disks, so you
can
choose your media for every project. No wonder Iomega can't  seem
to build enough of these to meet demand. Cost is $199.99 from
Iomega, 800-697-8833<p>

OK, you've got the sound card, great speakers, a big-screen
monitor
what's next to make your multimedia package perfect? Why the
Plextor 4Plex 43CS Plus of course.  The 4Plex 43CS Plus is a 4.5X
CD-ROM drive that transfers data at 600kbps (which smooths out
video performance), but the secret here is the ultrafast 170ms
access time that greatly speeds up disc searches. Front-panel
audio
controls are helpful for listening to music CDS.  Cost $329 from
Plextor, 408-980-1838<p>

Feeling extravagant this Christmas -then buy that special someone
a complete system. There are many to choose from out there.
Pentiums, 486's, Power Macs, and many others. Just make sure to
get
it with at least 8 mb of RAM (16mb would be even better). Other
items that make a multimedia system what it is include  a  hard
drive (with at least 800 mb of disk space), a video card with at
least 1mb (2mb would be nice) of VRAM, a good sound card, a
CD-ROM,
a modem, speakers, preloaded software and most important of all -
GOOD TECHNICAL SUPPORT. Without the support, the best system can
turn into a nightmare.<p> 

Snappy is an external video capture device that snaps into the
parallel port of your PC and captures high-quality images from
your
camcorder, VCR, or TV. At $199.95, it's a bargain, especially
with
its razor-sharp 1500 by 1125 resolution. The one-floppy software
program lets you edit and splice captured frames, as well as
adjust
color. Play, 916-851-0800<p> 

With Kai's Power Tools, the only limit is your imagination. This
image editing package works as a Photoshop plug-in or on its own,
and includes 33 filters to plump up your palette. Its gradient
designer, real-time previewing, fractal manipulator, texture
explorer, and advanced user interface are what make Kai's the
professional designer's choice. Cost $199 from HSC Software,
805-566-6200<p>

Reviewed in an earlier issue, Echo Lake from Delrina is a holiday
must have. If you are one of those people who never gets around
to
pasting those holiday photographs into albums? Echo Lake will
change that. This easy-to-use authoring tool lets you create
digital "yearbooks" from your own photographs, text, graphics,
video clips, and sound bites - in effect, making stories out of
the
important events in your life. It's the stuff that memories are
made of. And all for just $64.95.  It comes wrapped in a "cigar
box" like a cherished treasure from the past.  Delrina,
800-734-2330<p>

The Touche TouchPad is a stylish mouse alternative that lets you
click, double-click, and drag using the ball of your finger. The
$59.95 device has no moving parts so it won't jam on you, and its
small size makes the unit ideal for people who have to work in
cramped conditions. TouchPad $59.95 / Touche Technologies,
800-223-6433<p>

The Mitsumi Wireless Mouse, on the other hand, uses radio signals
to provide remote pointing up to a meter away. Its $49.95
competitive price will grab you. Both will work with DOS,
Windows,
and Windows 95. Mitsumi Wireless Mouse $49.95 Mitsumi,
800-648-7864<p>

Interactive Magic has four really great products out for the
holiday season. 

Star Rangers is a an action shoot-em up flight sim that lets the
user fly a variety of high-tech star fighters in your role of
upholding law and order and protecting the citizens of your
sector
of the galaxy. The graphics are high quality as is playability.
There's also an arcade practice mode so if you're not a real
flight
simhead you can still have some fun with this one. At $50 for the
CD-Rom it's a nice gift for that budding star ranger in your
house.<p> 

Apache is a combat helicopter simulation CD-Rom. Your in command
of
an AH-64D Apache Longbow combat helicopter fighting campaigns
around the world. The 3D graphics here are excellent, especially
the explosions as you wipe your enemy of the map. There's also an
arcade mode that will let you play right from the start (without
reading the manual). At around $50 this is a good buy for flight
sim fun.<p> 

Capitalism is a business simulation. You control every aspect of
running your corporation, from buying and selling stock to
figuring
out how to woo the customers into your retail outlets. SVGA
graphics and point and click interface. You can learn a great
deal
about owning and operating a business with this game and if you
make mistakes, you can always start again. The cost is again
around
$50.<p> 

Last but not least is Exploration. Here you assume the role of
one
of 5 explorers of the 15th -18 century. You can play against 4
other players or the computer. Columbus, Vasco De Game, James
Cook
are all here leading their nations to glory as they explore and
colonize across the world. While strategy plays a big role in
this
game -with such things as balancing trade and cash flow from your
colonies you also have the fun of sailing your ship around the
globe, fighting your opponents and building an empire. The
graphics
are all really cool painting and the sound track is quite nice.
If
there's someone on your gift list that's a history buff then this
would make a nice gift -at around $50.<p>

SSI has a great sequel to their big hit of 95, Panzer General.
This
time you are an Allied General leading your troops against the
German war machine. In a variety of scenarios or in a grand
campaign game that covers the entire European/North African
theater of war.
This
one is lots of fun and I recommend it to any WWII history
buff/war
gamer.<p>

Battle Beast from 7th Level Software is a sort of Mortal Kombat
or
Street Fighter for older kids and yes, even adults. The wild
animation and non-stop action in this fearsome fight game is
really
great. The goal: Destroy the Evil Toadman. The weapons: freeze
rays, flamethrowers, pulverizing plasma bursts--and 300
gut-wrenching sound effects. Parental guidance suggested. $49.95
(Windows CD-ROM) from 7th Level, (800) 884-8863, (214)
498-8100.<p>

Eastwood: Go ahead, make someone's day! Film clips, posters,
original movie reviews, home movies and loads of other Clint
memorabilia trace the actor's 40-year, 53-movie career, from
Revenge of the Creature (1955) to The Bridges of Madison County
(1995).Plus, in an exclusive interview, the
actor-director-producer
shares inside stories about his very interesting life and
career. $49.95 (Windows 95 CD-ROM) from Starwave, (800) 457-8646,
(206) 957-2000.<p>

You Don't Know Jack is a wild trivia game that drops you inside a
twilight zone version of a game show. The wacked out game tests
your knowledge of  pop culture against 2 other players. There's
over 800 questions that our hilarious and outrageous. You'll need
to be up on your recent TV and Music history as well as general
history and literature knowledge. <p>

One very funny question contains gibberish in which the words
rhyme
with the words of the commercial that the elderly women who had
fallen and couldn't get up "Quelp, jive gollen, man pie rant smet
pup! If you get that then you'll get the rest of the game as
well.<p> 

Contestants experience all the excitement of being on a TV quiz
show, right down to the wisecracks and verbal abuse they must
endure from a smart-aleck emcee. $29.99 (Windows CD-ROM) from
Berkeley Systems, (800) 344-5541, (510) 549-2300.<p>

Le Louvre--the Palace and Its Paintings: Even if a trip to Paris
isn't in your plans, you can enjoy the wonders of the Louvre by
examining 100 treasured paintings on your computer; highlight the
details or see the works in the full screen. The magnificent
architectural details of the palace itself also appear in
multimedia splendor. The best part is you don't have to spend big
bucks on airfare and you don't have to deal with those snotty
French folk who only like you if you're Jerry Lewis. $49.95
(Windows CD-ROM, Macintosh CD-ROM) from BMG Interactive and
Montparnesse Multimedia, (212) 930-6768.<p>


Looney Tunes Animated Screen Saver from Berkely, the makers of
AfterDark.  Relive the golden age of Warner Bros. cartoons on
your
PC with all the classic characters: Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd,
Daffy Duck, Sylvester and Tweety, the Tasmanian Devil, Wile E.
Coyote and the Road Runner, and the rest of the Looney Tunes gang
as they pop up in 12 gut-busting cartoons anytime you need a
break.
$29 (Windows, Macintosh, Windows CD-ROM, Macintosh CD-ROM) from
Berkeley Systems, (800) 877-5535, (510) 540-5535.<p>

Mortal Kombat 3 from GT Interactive Software/Midway/Williams is
an
interactive slugfest of fun. You've seen the wild commercials,
now
play the game. You play one of 15 different fighters as you fight
your way through level after level of blood and gore to stop the
evil Shao Kahn. There's no big plasma gun here, just hand to
hand/foot to foot combat at it's best. The graphics are well done
and the soundtrack it top notch. Get this game before it gets
you.
Network play is supported as well.<p.

Hurl for baby doomers of all ages by Millennium is a non-violent
action game. In this game you get to hurl water balloons and
bananas at the evil members of the Hardcore Union of Radical
Litterbugs <HURL) led by Bob the Slob. Bob and his gang have
stolen
the world's supply of clean underwear and it's up to you to get
it
back. OK, it's not Doom or Heretic or anything that you can blast
and blow up - but it is fun and good for the kids. Clean up the
world and watch out for flying day old kitty litter. Good
graphics
and a fun soundtrack make this CD-ROM game a good choice for the
kids or even as a change of pace for your favorite Doomhead.<p>

What's 7 CD-ROMs long, scary, bloody, violent and fun to play?
Phantasmagoria from Sierra Online that's what. Lot's of video
with
live actors make this one kind of worth a worth a scream or two.
The plot is a pretty good  mystery that should be enough to keep
you going - despite the awful acting through to the last CD-ROM.
A
young couple buy a large mansion on a strange island and before
long evil things start happening. I'm sure the plots been done a
hundred times  in those old 1950's movies but just when you're
ready to pack it in, the game throws out another unexpected twist
to keep you searching for clues. But remember: Don't go in the
basement!<p>

Lucas Arts has a bunch of great stuff out for the holidays. The
Lucas Arts Archives Vol. 1 has six cool CD-ROMs for only $29.95.
You get Indiana Jones and the exciting Fate of Atlantis, the very
funny Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle, Star Wars the Screen
Saver, the hysterical Sam and Max Hit the Road and the edge of
your
seat Star Wars Rebel Assault special edition. That's only five
CD-ROMs you say, well your right, but as a bonus Lucas Arts
throws
in another CD-Rom with exciting demos of Full Throttle, Dark
Forces, The Dig, Rebel Assault II and TIE Fighter -so you really
get a lot for your $29.95.<p>

Another pretty cool game from Lucas Arts is Full Throttle. The
basis premise is
the
you are Ben, a biker without a care in the world. Only now
someone's framed you for murder and you'll kill anyone who gets
in
your way to prove your innocence. Great cartoon animation
graphics
and a pretty nifty soundtrack make this game fun to play. Cost is
around $45-50. <p>

Lucas Arts have a couple of new games coming out that didn't make
it here for review. The long awaited The Dig which takes place on
a planet across the galaxy and Rebel Assault II, which with it's
action sequences and new Star Wars footage filmed just for the
game
might prove to be the hit of the season.<p> 

Last Year's Dark Forces is still a pretty good "Doom" style game.
The one problem was the save feature but despite that flaw, the
graphics and sound effects are first rate and the game is a blast
to play. <p>

Whether you want to design your own computer magazine or make
multimedia invitations, flyers, banners, or just simple
letterhead,
you can do it all from your desktop with the latest version of
the
decade-old publishing tool, Print Shop Deluxe Ensemble II
(Broderbund Software, $79.95, 800/521-6263, RSN 741) is
chock-full
of ready-to-print designs, fonts, and graphics.<p>

You can create your designs from the included templates or from
your own artwork or even add Photo CD images, and with the
built-in
name-and-address list manager you can print those cards - or
letters, invitations, and labels - and have them automatically
customized and addressed.<p>

If there is a Beatles fan on your list and he already has the new
CD then why not check out A Hard Day's Night on CD-ROM from
Voyager. It's not new this season -having come put last year, but
it is worth a look. You get the entire movie "A Hard Day's Night"
plus other clips, great Beatles songs and lots of text and
information on the Fab Four. About $40.<p>

Pitfall the Mayan Adventure:  Remember the old Atari 2600 game
Pitfall, with Harry swinging from ropes, bungee jumping and 
dodging ferocious crocodiles? Well, now  there's an updated
version
created especially for Windows 95 by Activision. All 13
heart-pounding levels of play have been souped up with awesome
visual and audio effects creating an excellent game for Windows
95
At 39.95 (Windows 95 CD-ROM) from Activision, (800) 477-3650,
(310)
473-9200, its a fun holiday gift.<p>

HSC Software (now know as MetaTools) has a lot of great software
for the Mac and PC including the award winning Kai's Power Tools
and KPT Convoler (both reviewed in previous issues). If it's
graphics design software look first to MetaTools before you go
anywhere else. This year they have a product called KPT Power
Photos II. And power they are, there are 375 digital images here
designed for you to use in your publications, newsletters or just
for fun. This volume includes Kids Toys and Backgrounds, A great
collection of Hotrods, Some fantastic Bugs and Butterflies, a
collection of Nostalgia images like old telephones and radios and
a wonderful collection of Fall and Winter Holiday images. The 5
CD-ROMS come packed in a nice hard-plastic carrying case and 
there
is a searchable "light-table" that lets you view the images as
small files rather than opening each one. If you need high
quality
images for web pages check this one out.<p>

Berkely has a nifty puzzle game called Triazzle. The catch here
is
that the puzzle is animated with a nice rainforest sound track.
The
game allows you to learn about the rainforest as you play. There
are multiple levels (including some for the kids) and it comes
with
a bonus AfterDark screen saver module staring a lot of Frogs.
Available for both the Mac and Windows.<p>

OK, you thought Doom was great, Doom II even better, Heretic
better
yet - well here comes the newest installment in the  Doom" clone
games from id software, Hexen, Beyond Heretic. Hexen has better
graphcis (3D), sound effects and game play than the othre three
games above combined. You have a choice of 3 different types of
characters to play, a warrior, a mage, and a cleric allowing for
multiple games on the same levels. Find Korax's evel stronghold,
defeat him and bring peace to the physical world. One word of
caution - it runs slowwww on Windows 95 -try the DOS mode.<p>

 Trophy Bass from Sierra makes a nice gift for the fisherman on
your list. You get all of the thrills and chills of bass
sportfishing without getting up early and getting wet. This isn't
just a simple game of cast your line and the fish bite, you have
to
figure in weather, equipment selection, bait, and technique
before
you can land the big one. I'm not a fisherman but I found this
game
to be entertaining and informative.<p>

Broderbund seems bent on corning the market on kids entertainment
software. They already have the very successful and fun Where in
the World is Carmen Sandiego, and now come s a great program for
the 9-13 age group called Alien Tales. The game places you as a
contestant on an intergalactic game show, hosted by Sal of
deCentury. You match wits with aliens who claim to have written
some of earth's great literature. There are a lot of passages
from
books here as you try to expose the aliens as the frauds they
are.
The game is designed to highten interest in reading and I think
it does a very good job by making reading fun and informative.
The
graphics are pretty good as id the hilarious soundtrack.<p>

If you or someone on your gift list is big on trains then
Abracadata has a couple of really hot products for you. The Train
Pack includes 2 programs on CD-ROM. Train Engineer allows the
user
to to design layouts and then operate a train on them with a top
view or a cab view. The graphcis are very well done and you do
get
the feel of moving alng the track. Design Your Own Railroad
allows
the user to do just that. You get to design precision, scale
model
layouts, scenery and the train cars themselves and then run your
trains on the tracks you've designed. Best part is if you go to
fast, a crash could leave wreckage scattered everywhere. Both
programs have great aniamtion sequences of actual trains.<p>

The second product from Abracadata is Trains the Screen Saver.
This
one comes with a great "movie show" option that runs real movies
of
steam and diesal trains. Theres also a slide show option and a
desktop mover that has trains moving across your screen,
occasionaly stopping to grab a chuck of desktop display and haul
it
away. Other options include a crisscross that has trains runnig
back and forth across the screen, an express option that shows
the
sideviews of trains as they race across your screen and switching
yard, where a railroad yard builds on screen section by section.
Call 1-800-451-4871 to order.<p>

Entomorph from SSI is a role playing game in their World of Aden
universe. This version is called Plague of the Darkfall and as
the
main character your role is to  discover why the inhabitants of
Aden are turning in to giant insects; before you turn into one
yourself. The game is a first person perspective with a top down
view (bird's eye). The graphics are very interesting and I
enjoyed
battling the giant Cockroaches and flying insects. The soundtrack
is pretty good. I had a bit of a hard time in the beginning
figuring out what to do. But once I got the hang of movement and
fighting it was a very enjoyable game. The CD-ROM is Windows 95
ready so it starts up as soon as you put the disk in the drive
(there's also a Windows 31 version on the same CD). About $50.<p>

I reviewed Family TreeMaker last year as an excellent holiday
gift
for anyone on your list. I still think it's a great gift for
keeping track of your family history. And now with version 3.0
it's
even better. The original manufacturers, Banner Blue Software are
now but a division of the ever growing Broderbund but this new
version has some great options that can't be beat. The Family
Finder option has  millions of names in it's database. Once you
find your family name in the database it's very easy to locate
resources on finding out more about your family history. This new
version also lets you incorporate photo CDs and print out all
types
of different reports, charts  and lists of your data once you've
compiled it. If you are interested in preserving you family
history, then this is the best program I have seen for the job.
<p>

Perfect General II from QQP is a cool tactical battle simulation.
There are lots of scenarios to choose from and you can zoom in
and
out of the tactical display to get a more strategic view. There
is
also live action video (not such a great job of acting) offreing
tactical ideas, a very good computer opponent, digitized sounds
and
even air support.<p>

High Sea Trader from Sierra/Impressions is a sailing/business
simulation. You assume the role of a 17th century merchant trader
sailing the seas and exploring exotic ports in search of glory
and
gold. The graphics are nicely done paintings, sea travel is a bit
tedious but not unlike what it was like in real life during that
period. Make sure to stock up on supplies or youre crew will die
like flies and you'll be cast adrift and end up penniless. If you
trade well you can rule an empire.<p>

Windows 95 always makes a nice gift for those few folks who may
not
have already purchased it. It's a nice operating system. It's not
really that much better than Windows 31 unless you go out and buy
all new 32-bit softwear to run with it.<p>

The PlusPack, in my opion, is a useless addition but some folks
might like the various desktop background and sounds that it
comes
with.. I will admit that the Internet Explorer that comes with
the
Pluspack is nice but you can download it for free from the
Microsoft website.<p>

 <b><center><h3>THE MAC MAVEN RETURNS:<br>
The Story of RAM Doubler and the New Hard Drive</b></h3>
<h4>By Charles E. Slate</center></h4><p>
<hr><p>
Hello folks!  I'm back from my long business trip to the Persian
Gulf, and my columns will resume appearing here on a
regular basis again.  If you have any desires as to what you
would like me to report on, then please drop me a line and
let me know!<p>  

The Story thus far:<p>

After using my trusty IIvx for a couple of years, I decided to
move forward into the 20th century by upgrading the 80
meg Hard Disk that Apple installed so many years ago.  I've been
using TimesTwo by Golden Triangle to double it for
a while now, but it's not compatible with RAM Doubler, so its
time to upgrade!<p>  

After my 3 month trip was over, I got on the phone and started
shopping around for a new HD.  After some careful
scrutiny (of both my wallet and the various advertisements), I
spied a Quantum Lightning 730 MB for $189 from Club
Mac.  Now, having dealt with Club Mac before when I bought my
Tenba PowerBook bag from them earlier this year, I
knew they were reputable and the price of $189 was pretty good. 
I gave them a call, and two days later had my brand
new Quantum 730 in hand.<p>


Now, the hard part.  I had to figure out how to get my data from
that old internal 80 meg drive onto my new 730 without
resorting to backing that 80 meg up onto about 100 high-density
floppies.  It just so happens that I had an old LaCie
external Hard Drive case so, I stuffed the new hard drive into
that old case, buttoned it up, attached the cables, and
nothing happened.  The internal drive in my IIvx refused to boot
up with the new drive attached.  So, off I went to call
Club Mac's totally superb technical assistance.  It seems that I
had forgotten about SCSI addressing.<p>  

You see, with the Mac's internal SCSI, each device attached has
an address to tell it apart from the other devices in the
chain.  Address 0 is reserved for the internal Hard Drive, and
Address 7 is the SCSI Controller.  Since Apple makes its
internal CD drives Address 3, (which I learned by calling
1-800-SOS-APPL). I should have figured out that the new drive
should be something other than address 0,1, or 7.  The techs on
the phone said two things;  one, change the SCSI address
on the new drive to something other than 0, and two, remove the
terminating resistors.  Well, this worked somewhat. 
Now, the IIvx would boot up, but it still didn't see the external
drive.  I played around some, changed the address to 5
and 6, put the terminating resistors back on, etc., but still no
dice.  At this point I was getting worried that my $189
purchase was defective.<p>

So, I tore open my IIvx (don't try this at home, folks.  I'm
specially trained for these types of operations) and poked
around a little bit.  Right about now, I realized that the
internal Apple CD300i was also SCSI, and had a standard SCSI
connector on the back.  This was good news.  It was a very tight
fit, but I popped that old internal CD out, plugged in
my new Quantum HD, and there it was on the desktop.<p>  

I proceeded to copy all the files over to the new drive and then
easily took out the old drive (which now is on the way
to Garage Sale Heaven) and installed the new drive into the
appropriate drive bay in the IIvx.  I buttoned it up, and now
here we are.  It sounds shorter than it really took, it actually
was about 4-5 hours of work total.  Good thing I had the
day off from work!<p> 

Installing RAM Doubler<p>

Earlier this year, I reported that RAM Doubler was fabulous on my
PowerBook 520.  I always wanted to try it out on
my desktop, since I use roughly about 8 times more extensions and
Control Panels on my desktop machine than on my
PowerBook.  That and the new version of America Online (Ver. 2.6)
requires 8 megs of RAM to run the World Wide Web
interface, pretty much forced my hand.<p>

After installing the new Hard Drive, that evening I popped in the
RAM Doubler diskette and clicked on the installer. 
Now, I have seen good (and bad) installers in my day, but theirs
is about the best.  One button (and about 3 seconds
later), RAM Doubler was installed and I was ready to go.  No
kidding.  It'll boggle your mind how quick and easy this
thing is to install, especially after going though the 1 hour
ordeal it is to install Word 6.0 or System 7.5.<p>

So, does it work?  Yes, it works great now, but the first time it
installed RAM Doubler, I don't know what happened. 
For some reason, the System, the Finder, and the Hardware Update
file (I'm still using System 7.1.1) got corrupted.  I
don't know if this was RAM Doubler's fault, or perhaps because I
formatted the new drive while sitting on its side and
then installed it in the IIvx flat.  After re-formatting,
re-installing the System, and re-installing RAM Doubler, now
everything works just great.  I can run Marathon with all my
extensions in place (impossible beforehand...), and I can
run several more applications simultaneously without much of a
slow down.<p>  

Currently, RAM Doubler costs around $49 street price, and if you
haven't gotten it yet, get it now or have your spouse
or significant other buy it for you for Christmas.   BTW, America
Online says that the new software (Ver. 2.6) does NOT
work with RAM Doubler.  I don't know why.  My machine works
perfectly, both with AOL and their new WWW software.<p> 
 
The moral of this story is:  Do your research FIRST before you
splurge on hardware and software. Second, don't attempt
to do something you're not comfortable with.  I've been a PC
hardware tech for about 12 years now, so tearing into my
machine several times in one day is no sweat.  But if you're a
new Performa owner, and it's your first machine, then
think twice before unscrewing the case and tearing it all apart. 
It would be a shame to ruin your big investment on
something like a cheap Hard Drive upgrade.  Most reputable shops
will install upgrades like Hard Drives or new SIMMs
for a reasonable cost, probably around $30 or so.  Most shops
that sell parts will do the work.  If you buy Mail Order,
you'll save more money, but those same shops will charge you more
to install those cheaper parts.  Make sure you shop
around before buying any upgrades!<p>

column in this issue, and remember the golden rule of
computer gift giving; "Keep the darn receipt!" Until next time...

 <b><center><h3>Growing your Home Business on the
Internet</center></b></h3>
<center><h4>By Martin Waterman</h4></center>
<center><img src="brassbar.gif"></center><p>
I am really excited about business opportunities on the Internet. 
 I have already heard many success stories.  However,
to do business on the Internet often requires a dramatic change
in  thinking.  The playing field is different from your
home turf and skills that you may feel are useless or unimportant
may be very valuable for those in a different area or
country. The same goes for products.  If you can get the foreign
rights to a product whether it is candles, maple syrup,
crafts or a novelty item, put up a home page, you may be
surprised where your orders may come from.<p>  

I am looking forward to feedback from this column and people
sharing their experiences and comments.  I am going to
try to feature people who are using the Internet to do conduct
business.  This month I interview a real live Cybrarian. 
Cybrarians are one of the new jobs of the Information age and not
only are they in demand by businesses, being a
Cybrarian itself can offer one an opportunity particularly if you
specialize in a particular kind
of information that is in need.<p>

Cybrarians are, of course, basically librarians but instead if
being surrounded by books, they are nestled into a computer
work station.  There they are connected to the Internet and
search the four corners of the globe in order to harvest
information from thousands of Universities, the World Wide Web,
from News Groups, governments, businesses,
organizations, professionals and, of course, other libraries such
as the Library of Congress.<p>

Consistent with the many faucets of the Net, there is more than
one type of Cybrarian. There is the traditional,
institutional librarian who has made the leap to the Internet. 
The other type of Cybrarian is more of a freelance
librarian or as an ode to the old west, a Cybrarian for hire (an
information bounty hunter).  A third type of Cybrarian
that has evolved is the Corporate Cybrarian.  Many large
businesses have always had corporate researchers to find
market and other information.  However, with the birth and
unprecedented growth of the Information Highway, many
businesses have found that the need for their own in-house or
part time Cybrarian if for no other reason than to monitor
their competition. No matter the reason that information is
needed, more and more organizations are finding they need
someone to handle this task.  This is usually because most
managers, who need the information the most, do not have
the time to surf and build an inventory of useful sites and find
the information that they need.<p>

I caught up with Lorna Peers, a real live Cybrarian at the
DISCscribe site which is located in Fredericton New
Brunswick.  Lorna holds a Masters degree in Library and
Information Science from the University of Western Ontario.<p>

She can be reached at <a
href="http://www.discribe.ca/cybrar.htm">"http://www.discribe.ca/cybrar.htm</a> or <a
href="mailto:lornap@discribe.ca.">E-Mailed.</a>  You can also
telephone her at 1-506-455-3108 or 1-800-567 -6288.  If you visit
her WWW home page you will see her photo and see that Cybrarians
are not chrome plated info hunters from the future.<p>

What follows is the interview I conducted with Lorna:<p>
     
TriCity: "What is your primary function as a Cybrarian?"<br>

Lorna Peers: "My primary function is to locate information for
clients or
members of the company using the Internet or commercial online
databases. I think your term information bounty
hunter is quite accurate."<br>

This includes:<br> 
* Individual requests from businesses and individuals.
* Locating competitive information for use by the company.  
* Background research and online promotion of clients who are on
our Web server.<p>
 
TriCity: "What percentage of your work do you find deals with
online promotion?"<br>

Lorna Peers: "I would estimate at least 50% and growing.  I'm
always finding new search engines and other places to
promote our clients' Web sites.  A lot of the time is spent
locating the most appropriate category in a directory such as
Yahoo."<p>
 
TriCity: "How do you typically online promote a company?"<br>

Lorna Peers: "At the design stage, I typically do some research
to see what similar sites may exist and where they are
located in directories or indices. Once the site is ready, we
write a brief press release or promo and post it in the
*appropriate* newsgroups, mailing lists,  search engines (ie.
Lycos, etc.), subject directories, and What's New pages.  
Online promotion is very important to Web sites. Regardless of a
site's value, it is of little use if it cannot be easily
located."<p>

TriCity: "What areas of the Internet do you find you use the most
to find information for your clients?"<br>
 
Lorna Peers: "I would have to say that I use the Web most often,
primarily because  of  the Web design we do for clients. 
For more general requests, I use the Web (usually first, as it is
the fastest growing portion of the Internet), gopher (less
so, I often find the information out of date or reach dead ends),
as well as newsgroups and mailing lists. On occasion,
I may come across a Web site with a contact name and send a
request by email to see if he or she can supply more
information. Others sources include library catalogs and
periodical databases."<p>

TriCity: "Is there such a thing as a common question you
receive?"<br>
 
Lorna Peers: "Not really, we've done some consulting for national
organizations that want to get their offices on the
Internet so I'm often updating my list of Canadian ISPs (Internet
Service providers)."<p>

TriCity: "What is the biggest information request you have
received?"<br>
 
Lorna Peers: "One client wanted a fairly comprehensive list of
Canadian companies that design and host Web pages, with
contact and pricing information. Finding the companies wasn't
difficult, but locating their list of services and pricing
information (when available) took a while. (Do you realize that
some companies didn't have contact information on their
pages?  Not very useful for the client who didn't have Web
access!)."<p>

TriCity: "Do you find that most of your customers are preoccupied
with the status  of their competitors presence on the
Internet?"<br>

Lorna Peers: No, not as much as they should be. Some businesses
still see barriers to the Internet (eg.cost of hardware,
cost of access, learning curve) despite the fact that their
competitor may already have a presence online.  This spring
we held two free seminars on using the Internet for local
businesses.  I think once they have the opportunity to see the
capabilities for themselves, they may realize its potential."<p>


TriCity: "What is the primary type of research you conduct and
for what type of  companies?"<br>
 
Lorna Peers: "In terms of individual requests, many companies
request a synopsis of  "what's out there" that may be
related to their type of business.  In many cases these
businesses don't yet have Internet access of their own, so the
results may help justify the decision to purchase access. I would
estimate that many of these companies are small
business."<p>

TriCity: "What does a Cybrarian typically charge?"<br>

Lorna Peers: " My rates range from $65 to $100 (Canadian) plus 
applicable taxes per hour for searching and formatting
results.  The rate depends on the volume of work and the urgency
of the information.  Additional charges may occur for
reprints, and with some commercial services there are extra
charges that may be required."<p>
   
TriCity: "Could you categorize for us the types of businesses
that you find most  often require the use of a Cybrarian and
for what purposes?"<br>

Lorna Peers: " I've done a number of searches for government
departments, where they required information for
presentations, or for decision-making purposes (eg whether or not
to proceed with a particular program).  I've done
research for insurance companies, telephone companies,
manufacturing, public utilities, hotels, nonprofit organizations. 
The businesses, individuals and organizations that have purchased
our Web services, range from the Chamber of
Commerce to music groups. They like the fact that I can put
together a list of links to other sites with related
information, as well as the promotion of their site."<p>

TriCity: "What do you like or dislike about being a Cybrarian as
opposed to a conventional librarian in a book-filled
environment?"<br>

Lorna Peers: "I like the fact that the Internet is constantly
changing and evolving.  It's all I can do to keep up on all the
new sites, software, etc. Navigating the Internet can be a
challenge, since there is no absolute list of its resources, but
the tools and indices have improved significantly.  I can't say I
dislike anything.  Who wouldn't love to surf the net all
day (and get paid)? I'm also adjusting to being (for the most
part) a telecommuter and working from home.  I missed the
daily interaction with co-workers at first, but there are lots of
benefits. "Also, since most of the communication and
transfer of my results is done electronically, I rarely meet my
clients face to face."<p>
 
TriCity: "What is the strangest request you have ever received
for information  (enquiring minds want to know!)?"<br>

Lorna Peers: " Well, we do have a site on UFO's.  I put together
a list of links to UFO pages on the Net.  There's a ton
of them. Another was for the availability of Internet access in
St. Lucia."<p>

The Language Barrier<p>

The language barrier is not insurmountable. This is because of
the way in which e-mail and the WWW work.  In the
Orient and Latin America many of the business people have very
poor language skills when it comes to the English
language.  However, when it comes to written skills, most have
better grammar than most North Americans.  When
dealing with a WWW site and e-mail, people in other countries are
not  intimidated and can take the time to compose
a response.  They may be very interested in using your services
as well as acquiring the rights to your product.<p>

The Nihongo Yellow Pages<p>

How would you like to advertise to the Japanese and even be able
to do it their language?  This is the inspiration behind
the  Nihongo Yellow Pages, Inc.  I recently interviewed Tetsuya
Yamashita, the owner  NYP Inc.<p>

He tells me that as of October he was averaging 5000-7000 hits
per day. 50% of those came directly from Japan, 23%
from the United States, 11% from other countries and 16% from
areas that are unresolved.  The remarkable
thing about the Nihongo Yellow Pages is that is has only been
going since June of '95.<p>

The site has received much publicity from several Japanese
magazines and Japanese and newspapers.  It is a bothersome
issue with the Japanese that the language of the Internet is
English.  The Japanese are very interested in the Internet
but language continues to be a problem.<p>

One of the early success stories was the Milne Jewelry Company
which started with an English home page and then had
great success when it was translated into Japanese.<p>

NYP Inc success comes from translating information into the
Japanese language for businesses that are interested in
the large Japanese market.  I took up their free trial offer and
created a business card which they translated into
Japanese for me.  I accented my P.R. and desktop publishing
capabilities.  I found it a very exciting experience.  If you
want to send e-mail to the Nihongo Yellow Pages their address is
webmaster@nyp.com Their WWW address is
<a href="http://www.nyp.com">go to site</a>   Their numbers are
voice: 408-379-5459, fax:
408-379-8042.<p>

I always try to practice what I preach.  I have hung my own
shingle out in Cyberspace.  The result of which is that I have
already picked up work from people stumbling onto my site.  I
have not announced the site at the time of writing and
am getting about 1000 hits per month.  I will be detailing in
upcoming columns how to get maximum exposure for your
site.  It is a numbers game.  The more people who visit your
site, the more orders and interest you are likely to generate. 
What surprised me the most about my site is that it is still very
much under construction.  For those interested, my
WWW sites are:<p>

*<a
href="http://www.discribe.ca/vidpix/">*http://www.discribe.ca/vidpix/</a><p>

 <b><center><h3>Quarterdeck Unleashes New Tools For Windows
95</b></h3><p>
<h4>By: Ted Wood</center></h4><p>
<center><img src="redline.gif"></center><p>
Quarterdeck is fast becoming a software juggernaut. First they
gave us Qemm, then Qemm 7.5, then Cleansweep. Then
they jumped into the internet feet first with Webserver and the
popular Quarterdeck Internet Suite. Now they've struck
gold again with a trio Windows 95 compatible applications
designed to make systems run better, faster, and more robust
than ever before. Unleashed upon the 32 bit (and 16 bit) world is
Cleansweep 95, MagnaRam 2, and Winprobe 4. All are
designed with Windows 95 users in mind, especially those users
with limited system resources (and limited cash flow!)<p>

Cleansweep 95<p>

Quarterdeck's Cleansweep for Windows was a great application, and
the Windows 95 version is a serious upgrade filled
with options and abilities. Cleansweep 95 allows for simple disk
cleanup of old files and more extensive archiving and
uninstalling options.<p>

I really liked the original Cleansweep for the fact that it was
compact (around 2 megs of disk space) and it could recover
many times that amount of lost space from your hard drive. The
first time I used it (under Windows for Workgroups)
I recovered 20 megs of wasted space from my drive. So Cleansweep
95 had some high expectations to live up to. And it
didn't let me down.<p>

Cleansweep 95 scours your hard drive finding temp files, old
backups, unused images, and anything else that's wasting
space. When deleting files, you can choose the safer options of
archiving (compressing) the file, or you can delete it. For
the truly worry-prone, you can save a log of all the
deletions/archive operations/uninstalls performed.<p>

Speaking of uninstalls, that's another great component of
Cleansweep 95. If you haven't noticed yet, not all Windows
95 programs come with an uninstall utility. So if you install
something you wind up becoming less-than-enthused about,
you may not be able to uninstall it from the Control Panel's
"Add/Remove Programs" applet. Cleansweep 95 can be set
to log each and every new file installation thus allowing you to
fully remove a file and delete all changes it has made to
the registry when you need to uninstall it.<p>

Another optional feature is the System usage monitor. This
monitor tracks file usage and recommends files for deletion
or archiving if they are rarely used. The usage monitor can be
customized to your preferences, allowing you to decide
when a file should be considered "unused".<p>

For those sticking with Windows 3.1 or 3.11, you're not left out.
If you buy Cleansweep 95, it comes with a free copy of
Cleansweep for Windows and a coupon for free upgrades of the
basic Cleansweep for Windows (3.1/3.11) software.<p> 

Cleansweep 95 is a must have for anyone with limited disk space
and those who like to keep their system tidy.<p>

System Requirements:  Intel-based PC running Windows 3.1x, or
Windows 95, 5 MB Hard Disk space.<p>

MagnaRAM2 (for both Windows 3.1x and Windows 95)<p>

Need more speed and power for your system? Can't afford to shell
out a few hundred dollars for RAM chips? Don't
bother! Grab a copy of MagnaRAM 2 and you'll be on your way to
high powered Windows operations without the high
cost and complications of RAM chips.<p>

MagnaRAM uses an proprietary memory compression technique to
provide up to 3 times more available Windows
memory to your system. The software takes information that is
currently in RAM and compacts it, allowing more new
info to be placed into RAM.<p>

MagnaRAM is configurable to your preferences, be they speed or
power. If you like to work quickly, you can create
smaller storage buffers, if you like the power of running
multiple applications, then you can increase the buffers.  A
graphical display tells the story of your memory and how it is
being allocated. The graphs are not  that easy to
understand, but basically all you need to know is that the
compression is working.<p>

The compression does work. I tested it by opening as many MS-DOS
prompts as possible under Windows 95. I gave up
at around 30, it was still going and never once complained about
low memory. (As I write this, I have  WordPerfect 6.0,
Windows Explorer, Amipro 3.1, Aldus Photostyler, 2 MS-DOS
Prompts, Windows Paint,  and HoTMetaL Pro running
with no resource problems) I'm running on only 8 MB RAM, so to be
running this many apps the compression had better
be working!<p>

MagnaRAM 2 is another outstanding product from Quarterdeck, and
at only $39.95 it beats buying more RAM chips!<p>

System Requirements: 386 or higher PC running Windows 3.1x or
higher, 4 MB RAM, and 2 Megabytes of Hard Disk
space.<p>

Winprobe 4:<p>

Last but certainly not least comes Winprobe 4, the
troubleshooting toolbox for Windows users. If you've got problems
with your Windows configuration, Winprobe may be just what you
need. It features a digital control panel with
tachometer style gauges of system performance, an ini editor (for
Windows 3.1x users), a registry editor (for Windows
95) and a variety of system and memory optimization tools.<p>

The best tool is the memory optimizer. Simply click the optimize
button and your system resources are optimized "on
the fly" for peak performance.<p>

In the same package as Winprobe 4 you get CD Certify Pro (for CD
optimization and  trouble-shooting), Quarterdeck
Mosaic (a great web browser), and Cleansweep for Windows 3.1x.  A
great package of products for the suggested retail
of $49.95.<p>

System Requirements:<br>
An Intel based PC running Windows 3.1x, or Windows 95, 2 MB of
Hard Disk space.<p>

Quarterdeck seems to be pushing cross platform products as is
evident by the ability to use all these applications on
Windows and Windows 95. With these three applications Quarterdeck
has scored a major coup in the high performance,
low cost area of software design. Coming soon is the eagerly
anticipated QEMM for Windows 95. If it's anything like
these three products, we could see Quarterdeck emerging as the
dominant player in the field of system and memory
management.<p>

 <b><center><h3>If The Grinch Comes This Christmas, Be
Prepared</center></b></h3><P>
<center><img src="bargold.gif"></center>
The air is brisk with winter's approach and for many here in the
Capital District it's a time, once again, to find a job. Yes,
as surely as January follows December, the approaching start of a
new calendar year finds many employers giving pink
slips just before or right after Christmas.<p>

This time around, though, skip the help wanted ads and start
searching the Internet -- you just might be able to find
gainful employment by New Year's
Eve.<p>

The best place to start a search for work on the Net is aservice
maintained by Ohio State University called the <a
href="http://www.cob.ohio-state.edu/dept/fin/osujobs.html">Business Job Finder.</a> In addition to the help you can get from this
site, it also lists
no less than 58 other great sites, many of which have
respectable listings for opportunities in many professions. It
also connects to 13 different university career centers.<p>

The Business Job Finder breaks into Accounting, Commercial
Banking, Corporate Finance, Insurance, Real Estate, and
several other specifiic related categories. These categories also
have links to a few employer home pages to help you learn
more about a specific company and to get advice on getting into
business school. If you're beyond that stage, go to the
Job Search sites and start exploring.<p> 

<a href="http://www. monster.com">The Monster Board</a> is
another great resource, not just because it has a database of
more than 5,000 jobs but because it contains a great tutorial for
putting together an online resume. You can comb the database with
the Career Search feature, which allows, in an easy to navigate
format, different kinds of search filters.<p>

<a href="http://www.careermosaic.com">Career Mosaic</a> is one of
the better resources out there. Whereas most jobs to be found
on the Internet focus on technical  jobs -- UNIX programmers, IS
managers, and the like -- Career Mosaic appears to
have the greatest variety in its professional database.<p> 

<a href="http://www.help wanted.com">HelpWanted</a> is quite
good. HelpWanted has a terrific database of listings and a good
search engine.<p>

There are many other sites out there to search filled with all
manner of jobs so good luck to you.<p>

<b><center><h3>OS/2 Warp Ramblings.</b></h3>
<h4>By Al Ramos</center></h4>
<center><img src="redline.gif"></center>                          
                                     
We've given Windows 95 more credit in these pages than it
deserves, so this month we decided to give the other 32 bit
operating system a test drive. What follows is Ivan's experiences
and opinions with OS/2.<p>

<pre>OS/2 Warp System requirements:
Intel 386 SX-compatible or higher*
4MB of RAM*   
35-55 Megs of Disk Space
VGA  Adapter or Higher
Bonus Pack requires 30 Megs additional
*if your delusional</pre><p>

My interest in OS/2 began in Sept. of 1993 after attending  an
OS/2 seminar by IBM.  I was impressed enough with its
capabilities that I purchased a copy of the operating system for
the special attendees price of $20.00.  Cheap price, but
twenty dollars is twenty dollars and the set-up nightmare
began.<p> 

Nothing short of  a reformat and repartition my hard drive would
solve the problem
(according to IBM tech. reps.).  I was not willing to go through
that inconvenience just so that  OS/2 could reside in its
own  drive partition.  I soon gave the operating system the
heave-ho and went merry on my way. <p>

October of 1994, OS/2 piqued my  interest when the new Warp
release was scheduled.
 Warp claimed to have solved the setup fiasco of previous
versions.  As a selling point IBM claimed their new product
to possess an intuitive and hassle free setup routine. What's
more ,  It claimed to enhance the speed of  my resource
demanding flight simulations, all this and also run my Windows
programs! WOW.<p>  

I wouldn't get my hands on a copy of  OS/2 Warp for  over a year,
in the mean-time, IBM's adversary, Microsoft had
released Windows 95 with an advertising campaign that made IBM's
effort seem inconsequential.<p>

The first thing one notices when opening IBM's red box, is the .5
inch thick Sources & Solutions booklet. This seems to
be IBM's attempt to comfort the purchaser that software and
services do exist for their operating system.  It is the Who's
Who of the OS/2 world.<p> 

Setup was uneventful ,  I would equate the experience with an
installation of Windows For Workgroups, quite a
turnaround from my experience the previous year.   I decided to 
install OS/2 Warp on my newly acquired note book
computer (Compaq Contura Aero).<p>  
 I first attempted to install OS/2 Warp (CD/ROM) via  Winlink 
from my desktop's CD/ROM drive.  OS/2's need to reboot
severs the Winlink connection, and deletes the drive mapping to
the host computer.   My trusty, if not obsessively sadistic
Editor  came to my rescue by providing me with the 3.5" diskette
format of WARP.  The 3.5" disk version contains no
less than 35 diskettes including the bonus pack.  If full
installation is desired you can easily consume 85 megs of hard
disk space, this is ontop of  your basic DOS installation and
Windows .<p> 

 If you want to still use your  Windows and DOS applications  you
can set up your hardisk for multiple boot options under
OS/2,  however  you must forego installing OS/2's High
Performance File System in order to maintain the FAT system
that DOS and Windows require! Can't have your cake and etc.
....<p>

HPFS High Performance File System enables the use of file names
up to 254 characters in length, It also provides  fast
access to large disk volumes, by way of high-speed buffering
(cache), It also purports to be able to support multiple file
systems on the same PC, i.e. FAT system etc. but in order to do
this you have to fragment your hard drive so that each
operating system resides in its own logical drive, each King of
its own domain.<p>  

The installation screen graphic is a  montage of a computer and
its peripherals rendered in dark blue hues, an identical
twin to the Windows 95 setup screen!  It seems as if some joker
at Microsoft couldn't resist the temptation to thumb their
nose at IBM.<p>

Although my laptop only possesses 4 megs of RAM,  I expected 
OS/2 Warp to  carry out routine functions faster than
it did. A four minute boot-up cycle was not what I expected.<p>

Everything on my laptop performed flawlessly, except slower.  I
noticed  that the machine had lost its ability to recognize
PCMCIA cards if inserted after boot-up.  This was due to an
incompatible PCMCIA slot driver.  I didn't scour the on-line
services for an OS/2 driver, it didn't seem worth the effort.<p>

OS/2 has one outstanding  feature,  it has the ability to
remember what you were working on last. example: shut down
the operating system while working in several different
applications. When your PC powers up again OS/2  loads the
desktop as you left it, your work ready to be resumed, cursor in
the same location.<p>  

One thing to remember if you do choose to upgrade to OS/2 Warp,
IBM is not a software developer. This means that
there is not a wide selection of  "readily available" 
over-the-counter software for your  new system, after awhile this
becomes irritating.<p>

The Bonus Pack which is now included with the purchase of Warp is
a necessity, and constitutes a combination of 
features best described as the fusion of  Windows 95 Plus Pack
and MS  Works.  IBM Works  contains the following
programs. Compuserve Information Manager for OS/2, IBM Works PIM,
Faxworks, Hyper Access Lite, IBM Internet
Connection, Multimedia Viewer, Video IN, Person to Person, System
Information Tool.<p>

Microsoft should taken a closer look at IBM's Bonus Pack  when
they were producing their own Plus Pack for Windows
95. The Bonus pack offers more useful programs than the eye candy
of the MS Plus Pack.<p>

I really enjoyed using OS/2 Warp, refreshing to have a change of
pace from my Microsoft dominated world, if it weren't 
for its sluggish performance I would have kept it on my
laptop.<p>

I can only surmise that if I had 16 Megs of RAM  things would
have worked out better than they did , but as my friend
Mark Roberts  once said "most computer problems can be solved
with money" either more memory, consultants or the 
replacement of new systems.<p>  

If OS/2 doesn't support your peripherals you are SOL. IBM is
quick to suggests the outright replacement of  CD/ROMS
dirves and their adapter cards irrespective of cash outlay.<p>

OS/2 once marketed to the retail world has fizzled, corporate
support for custom programs is the history and future for
OS/2 Warp.  Manufacturers such asCompaq refuse to supply tech.
Support to  users of OS/2,  exceptions are made only
for their file server line.<p>

32 bit S#$%. Does 32 bit processing power really have that much
to offer when your system is bogged down by an
enormous operating system ?  16 bit works fine and fast in my Win
3.1.<p> 

Irrespective of its advantages over Windows 3.1 as a crash Proof
system. Programs do crash under OS/2 they just don't
bring down the whole system, this same reliability is now
available by means of upgrading to Windows 95.  I do like OS/2, 
I just don't have a purpose for it.<p>

<b><center><h3>THE WHITE PAPER ON CYBERSPACE LAW</b></h3><p>
<h4>By: David P. Miranda, Esq.</h4></center><p>
<center><img src="redline.gif"></center><p>
Does cyberspace and the legal issues which have arisen through it
require a revision of  certain laws?  The Clinton
Administration's Working Group on Intellectual Property and the
National Information Infrastructure (NII) addresses
this issue in the recently released "White Paper" which contains
the Administration's official recommendations for
revision of  federal intellectual property law to meet the legal
concerns posed by the explosive growth of the Internet.<p>

Under the direction of Secretary of Commerce, Ronald Brown, the
White Paper explains how intellectual property law
applies to cyberspace along with legislative recommendations to
Congress.  The NII White Paper, can be found in its
entirety at <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/
web/ipnii">(http://www.uspto.gov/ web/ipnii)</a>.  The 230 page
paper covers a laundry list of current intellectual property
legal issues including, copyright law, licensing, liability of
on-line service providers, patent law, criminal offenses and
international implications.<p>

An addition to the Federal Copyright act is proposed, prohibiting
the manufacture or distribution of any device whose
primary function is to defeat anti-copying devices or to alter
copyright information.  This is designed to prevent the
rampant copying of software even in those instances where the
infringer has no profit making motive, such as a
non-commercial user.  Special exceptions are made for libraries
who are authorized to make copies in limited
circumstances.<p>

The White Paper also addresses the issues raised in the New York
case of Stratton Oakmont v. Prodigy, which held for
the first time that an on-line service provider could be held
liable as a publisher of defamatory materials appearing on
its service.  The Stratton Oakmont case was covered in the July 1995 issue of Tri-City Computing
Magazine, which can be found at:<a
href="http://www.albany.net/~tricity/mast.html">
(http//www.albany.net/~tricity/mast.html).</a><p>  
After the decision and subsequent outcry by commercial providers,
Congress added an amendment to the Federal 
Telecommunications Reform Act, to shield the industry with a
heightened threshold of liability, based upon actual
knowledge of the material by the provider and the ability to
remove it.  However the White Paper does not necessarily
favor a special standard for the on-line industry, but found
these to be among the risks of doing business.<p>

The paper also seeks to educate the public about the existence
and nature of the various intellectual property rights. The
imposition of  regulation will be difficult in light of the
Internet's history and commitment to the free dissemination of
information, as well as the fact that it stretches its lines to
all corners of the globe, beyond the jurisdiction of U.S.
laws.<p>

<b><center><h3>Have A Very Merry Mac Christmas</h3></b><p>
<h4>By Charles E. Slate</h4></center><p>

So, you really want a computer for Christmas?<p>

Usually about now, some people (parents especially!) are tearing
their hair out trying to decided which computer to buy
for themselves or for their children.  I know, it can be a tough
choice!  Pretty soon now, the stores will start having their
big sales, and the prices will get lower and lower the closer we
get toward Christmas and New Year's Day.<p>

The decision to buy a new computer should not be taken lightly. 
It is a considerable investment to make, one that should
last a good year or three.  The first basic question is; Should I
buy a Mac or one of those "IBM Compatible" PC's?<p>

Many PC companies offer complete systems in a single box (or
two).  Two big ones that come to mind are Compaq (the
"Presario" series) and Packard-Bell.  Apple also offers their
machines also in an "all-in-one" kit, the Performa series. 
Both kinds offer basically the same package; a complete computer
with keyboard and mouse, a monitor, some necessary
peripherals (more about those later), and usually some
software.<p>

Naturally (or maybe not!) you may be wondering, "Do I really need
all this stuff?"  The answer is qualified by the next
question you should be asking yourself, which is "What in the
world do I need a computer for?"  Now, if you're buying
a new machine to replace the one you already have, then you
already have somewhat of a clue what you desire in a sleek
new machine.  If this is your first machine, then you have to
decide just what exactly it is you're looking for.  Now I
realize that this is a tough task, since many people want a
computer before they really know what they want.  In that
case let me make some recommendations:<P>

#1.  Think Multimedia.  Most new and exiting software titles are
now coming out on CD.  The best games also are on
CD's.  This is great because CD's almost never wear out or go
bad, plus they can stuff a LOT of information on those little
silver disks.  With IBM-type machines, a CD-ROM drive and a sound
card are almost required for a home machine.  Look
for machines that have a built in CD-ROM (preferable Quad-Speed
or 4X), and a stereo sound card with external
speakers.<p>  

#2.  Think Modem and Internet.  Until better hardware comes
along, a modem is required to access on-line services such
as CompuServe and America Online.  Also, if you're interested in
getting around on the Internet, a modem is necessary
equipment.  Look for a 14.4K modem or (even better) a 28.8K. 
Also, many home machines also offer built-in telephone
hardware as well, which enables your shiny new machine to double
as a speakerphone and answering machine, or
provide voice mail services.  Look for these as well.<p>

#3.  Try not to think about Software.  I realize that many PC
companies trumpet all over their colorful boxes about the
Wonderful Collection of Software Inside!.  Take these claims with
a grain of salt, please.  Many times this software that's
included is pre-installed (no back up floppies), outdated
versions, crippled or demo software, or Shareware that must be
paid for if you keep it.   Be wary of bundled software!<p>

#4.  Shop around!  Prices vary widely from store to store.  With
IBM PC clones, the price range and the choices can be
staggering at best.  This is also true with Macintosh's, and
Performas in particular.  There are many different Macintosh
models available, so compare models and prices carefully before
plunking down that hard earned cash!<p>

Now, with all these new ideas floating around in your head, let
me make a quick sales pitch.  My opinion, in a nutshell,
is that you should seriously consider the purchase of a Macintosh
instead of one of those IBM clone-type PC's.<p>

Now, before I get back on my high horse, let me qualify that
opinion a bit.  First of all, I am not totally ignorant of IBM
clones.  As a matter of fact, I actually have more experience
with PC's than Mac's.  I have owned various PC's for over
a decade, and I still have one on my desk at work that gets used
every day.  I have been a PC repairman for most of that
decade, and I still do repairs and upgrades for a living.  Now,
having said that, I still would never recommend an IBM
clone to a first-time computer user or child.  And, if you've
previously bought a PC and are shopping for a new one, I
would heartily recommend that you reconsider and take a serious
look at the Macintoshes.<p>

Macintoshes have some serious benefits when compared to PCs. 
They are constructed better, and are generally more
reliable.   The Macintosh's operating system is more robust,
easier to use, and generally much more user friendly than
anything on the PC side, OS/2 and Windows 95 included.  Mac
software (and hardware especially!) is easier to install,
crashes less, and is much, much easier to use.  Macintoshes also
can exchange data with PC's much easier than PC's can
exchange data with Macs, a good consideration if you use PC's at
work.<p>

Are Macintoshes perfect?  Not at all.  Depending on which study
you believe, about 9 out of 10 computers out there are
IBM PC's, so there's less software and hardware available for
Macs.  This doesn't mean that there's nothing available,
just less of a selection than there would be with an IBM PC. 
However, Apple's Developer Conference in 1995, (a big
convention of Apple software and hardware developers held every
year), was the biggest ever, with a 30% increase in
attendees.  The Mac market is alive and well!<p>

Another thing is, they're a little more expensive.  When you go
to the store, it seems like a lot, but it's really not.  Macs
generally last longer and remain useful far longer than
equivalent PC's.  Plus,  the Mac's ease of use will save you
mountains of time and much hair-pulling.  The time savings alone
is well worth the few extra dollars a Macintosh will
cost you.  Also, Mac prices in general have fallen since the
appearance of the Macintosh Clones, and Apple has discovered
that indeed consumers DO appreciate a bargain, something that
took about 20 years to sink in, I think.<p>

These are just a few reasons to consider the Mac.  I haven't even
mentioned the wonderful Mac users who are all so
helpful, or the tremendous Macintosh presence at institutes of
higher learning, or all the extremely active Macintosh
users groups that are around.  In short, if you're going to sink
your hard earned dollars into a new machine this year,
do yourself and your children a favor and go for the Macintosh. 
I guarantee you won't regret it ever.  (This offer void
where prohibited by law.) Have a Merry Xmas!<p>

<b><center><h3>Mechwarrior 2</b><h3><p>
<h4>Review by Ted Wood</center></h4></h4><p>
<center><img src="brassbar.gif"></center>
"War? War is an organized bore" -Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.<p>

Apparently, Mr. Holmes  missed out on the decidedly un-boring new
game from Activision, Mechwarrior 2. If he had seen
this, his whole opionion might have changed.<p>

Activision has taken rock 'em sock 'em robots (tm) to a whole new
level with Mechwarrior 2 (MW2). Not content to simply
produce a good game, Activision's design team has put together an
awsome game, and an amazing multimedia product
to boot.<p>

MW2 is set  in the year 3057. At this time the greatest battle 
for power man has ever known is raging between rival
clans. The entire universe is in a state of unrest as the Jade
Falcon Clan attempts to annihalate all traces of the Wolf
Clan and return to Terra. The Wolf Clan is not about to let this 
happen, and so the wars have raged for decades. <p>

The weapon of choice is the BattleMech, or 'Mech. These 30 ton
juggernauts pack more weaponry than a Terran tank
platoon. Yet, the 'Mech is nothing more than a heavily armed
trash compactor unless it is piloted by someone who is
skilled in the art. And that's where you come in, as a
Mechwarrior. Piloting the robotic behemoth you can fly  over a
small village, or incinerate that same village with a flick of
your finger.<p>

Piloting a 'Mech isn't all that easy. The Cockpit Control
Reference card that comes with the game reads like an actual
military equipment instruction manual. There are dozens of
commands and actions listed, and hitting the correct
combinations of keystrokes can become challenging in the heat of
battle. Luckily, there are a few simple commands on
the Novice Piloting Card that help the player learn basic
piloting and combat operations quickly.<p>

The graphics in Mechwarrior 2 are simply stunning, from the
opening battle scenes right down to the smallest explosions
and burning fires, everything is beautifully rendered. The
animations and movies flow smoothly, even on a simple double
speed CD ROM. Installation allows the user the option of
installing the movies and animations to the hard drive, which
isn't a bad idea when it comes to significantly speeding
gameplay.<p>

The missions in MW2 are  simple. Kill, maim, destroy. That sums
it  up. This game contains no mentally taxing missions
or puzzles.  There are  no scouting missions or likewise boring
scenarios to work through. Just complete wanton
destruction. Fortunately for us, the only destruction is of
equipment and other 'Mechs, no human slaughter (as is the
case with DOOM!, Heretic, and that whole genre of gore-fest 
combat games).<p> 


There are dozens of 'Mech designs and variants to choose from but
you have to earn the right to pilot them. Every
successful mission rewards the pilot with honor points. The
"honor system" is a throwback to the Dungeons and Dragons
(tm) type games' "experience point systems" wherein a player that
lives a long time and kills many enemies becomes more
powerful. As a pilot gains honor in MW2,  he also earns the right
to pilot  bigger, tougher 'Mechs and the ability to lead
squads (or "stars") of 'Mechs into battle.<p> 

Mechwarrior 2 is awesome.It's a complete multimedia gaming
experience. After installation I spent the first hour just
watching the mini-movies that are on the CD. The opening sequence
with 'mechs in combat is exceptional to watch. The
sound clips are equally of exceptional quality and the game
sounds are incredibly lifelike (though I'm not sure what a
particle projector cannon would sound like in real life).<p>

If you are looking for an awesome  shoot 'em up game with great
sounds, effects, graphics, and challenging missions,
MW2 is just what you the doctor ordered.<p>

<b><center><h3>A Harvard MBA - in your Computer?</h3></b><p>
<h4>By Martin P. Waterman</center></h4><p>
<center><img src="redline.gif"></center><p>     

Norman Wu spent years consulting with Blue Chip companies
imparting to them knowledge on how to be more
successful.  The problem was this was that his suggestions were
rarely implemented.  Frustrated, Wu went about to
design a software that would help managers not only identify
goals but actually see them through to successful
completion.  The result of this effort is a program called
ManagePro which was first released in 1990.<p>  

Like most things, at the heart of this software is something very
simple. Probably the best way to describe ManagePro
is that it is a marriage between a Personal Information Manager
(PIM) and a Database.  However, that may be over
simplifying things a little too much since the software is based
on proven processes that evolved from "Management by
Objectives" in the 1950's.<p>    

Using proven management practice, ManagePro helps managers with
their most
important responsibilities such as meeting goals, managing people
and solving problems.  Management objectives and
sub-goals are entered into a planner which looks very much like a
spreadsheet.  Goal and people status
boards, time lines, action lists, calendars and reports are
color-coded which prompt management and operatives through
proven successful management practices.<p>

Of course, all is elementary if the goals are unobtainable or
unrealistic which brings to mind the well-worn computer
adage; garbage in - garbage out. Doubling sales in a year may be
an obtainable goal.  However, doubling sales
in a few months will probably result in goals that no matter how
well monitored by the software may never have a
chance to be executed. I was surprised that the software even
prompts management to set realistic goals.<p> 

The software does offer advice through the Management advisor
which provides on-screen management tips and
techniques by experts.  However, management being management, I
wonder how many will follow the advice.  The
software does try to compel management to create clear and
measurable goals with
specific checkpoints which starts the process going.<p>

ManagePro at work<p>

This program is trying to shake of some off some of the earlier
criticisms that stemmed from the fact that this program
was awkward to use.  However, ManagePro has been through several
major changes and version 3.0 adds a
number of new features that have been requested by it's
customers.  This includes MultiLink which permits
organization-wide sharing of goal and progress data boosting
accountability throughout an organization.  Other features
include Job-specific Templates which give managers sample data
bases that reflect different job functions and industries
which give managers an easy place to start.<p>

The Project Management and Action Management modules have been
expanded to
include new features such as multiple budget/cost fields.<p> 

The secret of this software is that  so long as Mangers input the
correct information and manage the database, it does
not  allow projects to get sidetracked by delays, office
politics, neglect or any other negative influences that cause
projects
to go astray.   This is because  weak links are apparent since
there is accountability throughout the organization by all
who are involved (Should this program be mandatory for Government
bureaucracies?). Any backsliding is automatically apparent to
anyone in the
organization who has access to the database. If you are assigned
a task and it is not executed then management and your
co-workers know why the project is not being implemented as
scheduled.  In this regard, ManagePro fosters
team work within an organization particularly since linked
databases can allow the sharing of information across various
departments and levels of an organization.<p>  

From a managers standpoint, you can stay on top of your goals and
projects since you can find the status at the click of
a button.  The ManagePro Assistant scans your data and shows you
which task, goals, and people
activities require your immediate attention so that you can stay
focused on your objectives.  And since every boss (with
very few exceptions) has their own boss, you can print more than
thirty standard reports on goals, people and actions. 
If that were not enough, you can also create an unlimited amount
of custom reports.  Of course, as a manager you may
have to deal with some employee discontent among those operatives
that are not used to a high level of accountability,
supervision or those who resist change because it has always been
done a different way.<p>
     
Despite its faults, ManagePro has set a standard for management
software and is being used by over 65,000 managers
in business of all size.  One of the larger businesses that has
adopted ManagePro is Charles Schwab and Co. This
software has also won 8 top product awards and probably the
reason for the success of this software is that it is
continually adding more and more
useful features and evolving to meet the needs of managers.  For
some organizations, this software has been credited
with breathing new life into the company and catapulting them
into new areas of growth that were not
considered obtainable.<p>

Another interesting thing about this program is that is well
suited for an individual or single user to initiate and track
your goals. More
importantly, you do not have to be an experienced manager to use
ManagePro
and experienced users will already be familiar with concepts that
they have been taught or use.  ManagePro does not
take a great deal of muscle to use. You need at least an
IBM-compatible 386SX running Windows 3.1 with 4 MB of RAM
and 7 MB or free hard disk space along with a VGA monitor.  There
is
also a Macintosh version available.<p> 
ManagePro has a suggested retail price of $ 279.00 but can be
usually found for less than $ 200.00.  If you have an earlier
version of the product, you can upgrade for $ 99.00.  Manage Pro
is manufactured by Avantos Performance
Systems which also makes an award-winning product called Review
Writer which helps managers write employee
performance reviews quickly and easily.<p>

Continuing the search for unique and memorable holiday computer
gifts: How about the ultimate in fashion and
expression? A T-shirt with a clever computer phrase.<p>

ComputerGear's line of T-shirts displays dozens of the best
computerisms, including a few new ones. A short list of my
favorites:<p>

Will Program for Food.<br>
Byte Me. <br>
Insufficient Memory at This Time.<br>
Mac My Day. <br>
Seen My Mouse? <br>
Press Any Key.<br> 
So Much Code...So Little Time.<p> 

The 100 percent cotton shirts go for about $17. Sweatshirts cost
about $28 and come in a variety of colors. Children's
sizes are available at less cost. For a catalog, contact:

How about a pet?<p>

OK, so how about a dog? But what kind? Buying a dog for someone
is difficult at best. How about a virtual dog?<p>

Dogz, from PF Magic and distributed by Virgin Interactive
Entertainment, is billed as the first-ever pet that lives in its
owner's computer. Each pet has a unique brain, personality and
look. While you go about your normal business, Dogz
may scamper across your screen at any time. They might play
games like hide-and-seek (behind an open window or off the
screen), fetch, catch or just nap in the corner while you
work.<p>

This differs from a screen saver, which stops when you touch a
key or mouse. Dogz is always active. You can even teach
your Dogz to perform nifty tricks! Activating GuardDogz combines
traditional screen saver features with limited file
protection. Dogz is available in several breeds and can be
"adopted" at your local store or downloaded from <a
href="www.pfmagic.com/dogz/adopt">PF Magic</a> at their Web site.
Here you download a free adoption kit or take a Pup Quiz that
helps you decide which Dogz are right for you. Currently
available for PC only, the Macintosh version should be ready
first quarter of 1996. So what will they think of next? Catz, of
course! PF.Magic (415) 495-0400<p>

<b>CD-ROM magazines.</b><p>

I've noticed that bringing a magazine format to the multimedia
world of CD-ROM continues to be successful, especially
since most of today's computers have CD-ROM drives.<p>

You can watch exciting interviews and read fascinating articles
on just about anything imaginable. One of the latest
CD-ROM magazines is Blender, from Dennis Publishing. One issue
contains interviews with Traci Lords and Courtney
Love, music and movie reviews, editorial cartoons and more. A
one-year subscription (six issues) costs $29.95; three

<b><center><h3>Pipeline USA Offers More Internet for Less
Money</h3></b><p>
<h4>By Ted Wood</h4></center><p>
<center><img src="redline.gif"></center><p>
How do you get more people to use the internet? If you've got any
clue as to marketing the internet,  you have to make
it dirt cheap and incredibly easy to use.  Pipeline  USA has
succeeded on both counts, they offer unlimited internet
service for only $19.95 per month, and you get their connection
software free!<p>

A hookup to the  Pipleline couldn't be easier. The software is
packed on one floppy disk which installs in less than five
minutes. The installation routine takes you by  the hand and
guides you through the setup. With Pipeline USA, there
is  no need to learn about static and dynamic IP addresses or
anything of the sort. You only need to follow the on screen
instructions, choose your login, and sign on the 1-800 number.
After that, you choose your local dial in number. Since
most areas have only one point of presence (a dial up provider
number) this choice is relatively simple to make.<p> 

After you've installed the software and chosen a local POP, the
internet is yours to explore.  Since you have  unlimited
time for your $19.95, you can teach yourself how everything works
without having to watch the clock and worry about
incurring any extra time costs.<p>

The Pipeline USA software offers a full compliment of  internet
tools. FTP (file downloading only), Archie, World Wide
Web (through the built in Pipeline browser), email, usenet news,
and IRC (chat)  are all there for you to use. Some of
the tools are great (email is especially good) and others are
lackluster  (FTP and news).<p>

The software is incredibly robust. It  offers powerful
multitasking with few, if any, crashes. In Windows 3.1 and 3.11,
multitasking was a difficult animal to tame, yet the Pipeline USA
software handles it all smoothly, allowing for
downloading and performing other tasks simultaneously without a
hitch. Under Windows 95, the Pipeline software
performs incredibly well with no crashes or system lockups, even
while downloading several files and viewing other areas
at the same time.<p> 

When you log in to Pipeline USA you are greeted
with a miniature window (which is somewhat small
and hard on the eyes). This window is your basic navigation tool.
You may choose email, newsgroups, Web browsing, help,
or any of the ten pre-set categories listed in the navigation
window. The categories are helpful to new users, leading them
straight to specific sites on the internet to read the news,
check the weather, and basically see what's on the Web. Other
services (FTP and IRC) are listed in the pull down menus at the
top of the window. The navigation screen is always a
quick mouseclick away  in case you get lost and need to go back
to a home base.<p>

Most of the applications are quite good, with the email utility
leading the pack in quality and simplicity.  Sending email
through Pipeline USA is no more challenging than using US Postal
Mail. Just fill in the required info (address, subject,
etc.) and send it off with a mouse click. Attaching a file is
just as intuitive. Simply  select "attach file", choose the file
from a file manager-like dialog box, and the software will decide
if the file needs to be encoded and how it should be done.<p>

The newsgroup reader is easy to use but lacking in power.
Pipeline USA's  news server needs a larger selection for those
of  who  like to keep a large reading list. The newsgroups are
categorized making them more accessible to new users, but
serious users will be begging for more groups to be added.<p>

The FTP application for downloading files is fast and easy. Point
and click your way through the dialogs and you'll be
downloading files from the net in no time flat.<p>

The FTP application also sports a  search function. If you're
looking for a specific file, and you know  part of the name,
simply  perform a search for it. More often than not  if the file
exists  the search application will find it.<p>

Chat is straightforward Internet Relay Chat. If you don't know
much about IRC, you may want to ask a friend for help
or find a good book on it. IRC uses some of the more less than
obvious UNIX commands thus making it tricky to learn
and to use properly.<p>

Finally, there's the Web browser. This really needs work. It's a 
weak browser overall. It is fast, but it barely supports
current HTML standards.  It's not very impressive, but it's a
good starting point for a  beginner. Advanced users will
definitely plug their own favorite browser in (see the reviewer's
notes for info on this) for web surfing.<p>


Rating:<p>

If you're new to the on-line world and want a straight internet
connection instead of an on-line service (and the
outrageous bills!) Pipeline is an excellent starting point. As
you become more skilled, you'll outgrow the tools that come
with the software, but the newest version of the software (due
out late October) will allow you to basically plug your
favorite browsers, FTP applications, and such in and go. This
flexibility, ease-of-use and cost consciousness makes it a
good bet for someone new to the net.<p>

If you're an old hand at net cruising, the Pipeline  has
something to offer you. First off, it's hard to beat $19.95 flat
per
month. Also, as  previously mentioned, if you don't like the
utilities that come with Pipeline USA, just plug in your
favorites and go.<p>
For a business user, Pipeline USA could be just what you need. 
At less than $20 a month, it won't break the bank and
accounting will love you for it! Since all the software you need
comes on the install disk, there's no need to buy expensive
email applications or scour the net for shareware/freeware
applications. Pipeline is easy enough for anyone in the office
to figure out.<p> 

One final caveat :If you're looking for someplace to store Web
pages and maintain a personal FTP site, you'll be better
to find a local internet provider as Pipeline will only be
offering a single Web page for its users and it hasn't set a
limit
yet on the size (most likely less than 2 Megabytes per user).
Business accounts will soon be allowed to store pages on
Pipeline USA's server, but that is not currently available.<p>

Reviewer's notes<br>
This section is devoted to my personal experience with Pipeline
USA, your experience may differ.<p>

Installation:<br>  During the installation I received a message
stating "Inaut001.dll is out of date you may have trouble
connecting properly".  I found that this wasn't the case as the
software worked fine. So I called the technical support
office and found out that a small shipment of "bad" disks was
inadvertently sent out to the public. These disks contained
an older version of the above mentioned .dll file but the rest of
the software was new. According to technical support,
it wouldn't cause any problems but a fix was available via an FTP
download from Pipeline USA's FTP site. Getting the
new .dll was easy, I just connected to ftp.psi.net, went into the
pipeusa directory, and found the new Inaut001.dll. After
downloading it, you need only replace the old version with the
new, which is a simple swap in file manager.<p>

Connections:<br> I have not encountered any  problems logging in
to Pipeline. I have never received a busy signal when trying to
log in and I've never been disconnected once on-line. All files
that
I've downloaded are clean (non-corrupted) and the connection
speed is great. I've timed downloads from America Online's FTP
utility, my internet FTP software, and Pipeline's FTP
software and found them all to run about the same times. Using
the multi-tasking abilities of the software doesn't
drastically slow the downloading either, which is a great
plus.<p>

Technical Support:<br>

Fast and friendly, you can't beat their tech support staff. On
the phone, they were courteous and knowledgeable, online
they are the same. Every day on-line there are scheduled tech
support meetings between users and support staff. At
these meetings you can chat and ask questions about Pipeline USA
and any problems you might be having.<p>

Email requests for help were responded to within a day. Most were
very helpful, and some even suggested I meet them
in the chatroom to discuss my problems and learn about any that
others might be having. To see what types of problems
other users might be having, I paid a visit to the chatroom. My
visit found two users discussing problems with the staff.
The only real problem anyone seemed to have was in turning off
their modem's speaker when connecting. After several
visits to the chatroom, I discovered that people just didn't seem
to have problems with Pipeline USA, or they were so
simple they fixed them on their own.<p>

Software:<br>
As I've mentioned the software will be allowing users to plug in
their favorite winsock compliant applications. This
means you can run Netscape, Mosaic or any other winsock compliant
web browser and chat application you like. While
currently in beta, I was allowed to test this new package and it
performs very well. Adding an application is
straightforward (there's a special "Add Winsock Apps" item on the
navigation screen for this purpose).  Netscape and
Mosaic ran flawlessly and although Pipeline's tech staff advised
against it, I tried using my favorite FTP program
through Pipeline. Guess what? It worked! It was a little slower
than the integrated Pipeline FTP application, but it did
work.<p>

Winsock applications run through the Pipeline connection do seem
to operate a bit more slowly than when run through
a regular winsocket, but not so slow as to be considered "bad".
<p>

Pipeline USA is a solid, easy-to-use service at a great price. If
you're just getting your feet wet on the Internet, or you're
a seasoned 'net vet, you're sure to find Pipeline USA to be worth
subscribing to.<p>

VISA HOME-BANKING SOFTWARE: Visa International introduced its
home-banking software that allows bank
customers to balance checkbooks, pay bills and transfer money
between accounts.  Two banks have signed up so far to
offer the services to their customers -- Mississippi-based
Deposit Guaranty National Bank and Salt Lake City-based Zions
First National Bank.  Meanwhile, Visa Interactive is developing
other ways to offer home banking, including a
screen-phone, and is working with Worlds Inc. to develop 3-D home
banking software. (Investor's Business Daily 10 Oct

PENTIUM PRO RIVAL: NexGen has announced a new chip design in its
effort to go head-to-head with chip giant Intel
Corp.  NexGen's Nx686, which will be available in the second half
of next year, is reported to be both smaller and faster
than Intel's comparable Pentium Pro chip.  In addition, the
NexGen product will deliver better performance on 16-bit
systems such as Windows 3.1.  The downside to NexGen's product is
that it requires accessory chips and special circuit
boards, making it non-interchangeable with Intel chips.  (Wall
Street Journal 10 Oct 95 B6)<p>

TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SHAPED BY ECONOMICS: Claiming that social and
economic forces outside the computer
industry will affect technology more than R&D trends, MIT
economist Lester Thurow says that "if educated Chinese
workers can be employed for a fraction of what U.S. workers are
paid for the same task, that will have a huge impact."
(Computerworld 9 Oct 95 p78)<p>

SKILLED IMMIGRANTS NEEDED FOR HIGH-TECH WORK: A letter to
Congress from Microsoft CEO Bill Gates
(cosigned by CEOs of Hewlett Packard, Intel, Sun, and Texas
Instruments) says:  "The availability of computer and
software engineers on a timely basis is critical to our business
success.  Delays in design, development and production
mean a loss of market share that may never be recaptured."  The
CEOs are worried about immigration laws that would
deprive them of skilled labor.  Microsoft's labor force is 5-7%
foreign-born.  An emigration expert at the Carnegie
Endowment Fund observes that companies are perfectly capable of
moving operations offshore if the talent they need
is denied them.  (Financial Times 7/8 Oct 95 p9)<p>

DIGITAL STANDARD SET FOR CAMERAS: Apple Computer, Canon, Eastman
Kodak, Hewlett-Packard, LG
Semicon Co., Matsushita, Motorola, NEC, Polaroid, Seagate, and
Seiko Epson have banded together in an alliance to support the
CompactFlash memory cartridge technology as the standard for
digital cameras, computers, pagers and other related
technologies.  The small matchbook-size cartridge works like
reusable film in a camera, storing images that can later
be displayed on computers and printed out on special printers.

CD MATCH: The Interactive Multimedia Association is planning a
"CD Match" campaign this fall designed to prevent
some of the frustration suffered by the 30% of consumers who
purchased CD-ROMs for home use last Christmas only
to return them due to incompatible hardware.  The free software
will allow users to print out lists of their PC's
capabilities, which will correspond to special
labels on CD-ROM packages.  The software will be available free
on the Web. (Investor's Business Daily 10 Oct 95 A8)<p>

PC REPLACES TV AS AFTER-SCHOOL ENTERTAINMENT: A new study from
FIND/SVP shows parents in nearly
two-thirds of PC households reporting that their children watch
less TV as a direct result of using the family computer. 
That figure rises to almost three-quarters in homes with
CD-ROM-equipped PCs.  Young girls (up to 6th grade) actually
use the PCs more than boys, but that trend reverses itself among
older groups of children.  (The American Household
Survey, FIND/SVP)<p>

XEROX TO CONNECT COMPUTER, FAX, COPIER, PRINTER: Xerox is
introducing a new device to link office
computers, fax machines, copiers and printers.  The combination
machines offered by competitors such as
Hewlett-Packard and Ricoh do not equal Xerox's in terms of size,
complexity, power or cost ($20,000-38,000 for the initial
models).  (Wall Street Journal 12 Oct 95 B5)<p>

NETWORK SECURITY: The Internet has a well-known inherent security
weakness due to its use of the NFS (Network
File System) protocol, which does not have any way of determining
whether a file or message has been altered during
transmission. But executives at Netscape Communications say they
will make changes in the Netscape browser software
to allow a recipient of a downloaded program to check to see if
it's been tampered with.  (New York Times 11 Oct 95 C3)
The company has also announced a "Bugs 



Bounty" program offering $1,000 to the first person who can
identify a major security bug in the new beta version of its
Netscape browser software.  (Wall Street Journal 11 Oct 95 B6)<p>

PACKARD BELL SUES COMPAQ: Packard Bell Electronics has now sued
Compaq Computer, alleging unfair
competition, defamation and false advertising, echoing the
charges in Compaq's lawsuit filed against Packard Bell last
April.  The original suit had protested Packard Bell's practice
of selling computers that contained parts from returned
computers as "new."  Packard Bell settled in July for $1 million
and changed its warranty policy, while denying any
wrongdoing.  The information now prompting Packard Bell's
countersuit remains a mystery.  "We have filed a motion
to unseal that exhibit, so it may be a matter of public record,"
says Packard Bell's attorney. "It's in the public interest
to understand what these practices are... (Compaq) portrays
itself as an angel with respect to its (returned product)
practices, but Compaq's halo is going to slide down and become a
noose around its neck."  Packard Bell is seeking
punitive damages, reimbursement of lost income "due to the
campaign Compaq has waged against the company" and a
court order forcing Compaq to "run
corrective advertising."  (Houston Chronicle 11 Oct 95 C1)<p>

U S WEST TEAMS UP FOR ONE-STOP SHOPPING ON THE NET: U S West has
teamed up with Microsoft, Cisco
Systems, Netscape and Lotus Development Corp. to create a
one-stop service for companies that want to establish an
Internet presence.  The group will handle everything from
setting up Web pages to providing encryption for sensitive
messages.(Business Week 16 Oct 95 p52)<p>

SPIDERS ON THE WEB: It's getting crowded out there on the Web,
with dozens of spiders now competing over which
can find the most pertinent information the fastest on any
particular subject.  Some industry observers are looking down
the road and speculating that the gatekeeping function of spiders
-- software that traverses the Web and points to
information in response to a specific query
-- may ultimately supplant other information sources, such as the
Yellow Pages, newspaper ads and vendors of costly
legal or medical research. (Forbes 23 Oct 95 p210)<p>



AT&T WANTS TO BE YOUR LOCAL PHONE CO.: AT&T has for the first
time acknowledged publicly that it plans
to challenge its progeny on their home turf -- by competing
head-to-head with Baby Bells and GTE on local phone service. 
"We will fight for the right to give our customers a choice for
local service through every option open to us.  That includes
reselling local services, using alternate providers and building
our own telephone-network facilities," says Chairman
Robert Allen.  Analysts are watching AT&T's negotiations with
companies such as Time Warner and Metropolitan Fiber
Systems, whose cable lines could offer AT&T instant entree into
the local market, and some have predicted that AT&T
may try to merge with a major phone company such as GTE.  "GTE's
in all the profitable markets," says one.  "It makes
slam-dunk sense."  (Wall Street Journal 27 Oct 95 A3)<p>

NOVELL TO DIVEST WORDPERFECT: Novell Inc. has declared its
intention to sell most of the  software lines it
acquired when it purchased WordPerfect Corp. 16 months ago.  The
move reflects CEO Robert Frankenberg's belief that
Novell should concentrate on core networking applications. 
Speculation has cited IBM, Computer Associates and Oracle
as potential buyers, but the more likely scenario, according to a
Goldman Sachs analyst, is a buyout proposal from
private investors that would make WordPerfect an independent
again.  (Wall Street Journal 31 Oct 95 A3)<p>

SPEEDIER SERVICE FROM NETCOM: In an effort to speed up service,
Netcom Online Communication Services Inc.
is investing in high-speed network switches made by Cascade
Communications Corp.  The new switches will allow large
volumes of data to be transmitted
more quickly, and also will enable Netcom to track and manage the
data being transported.  UUNet Technologies and
Performance Systems International are also buying Cascade
switches.  "We've been talking about an information
superhighway, but our infrastructure is really just dirt roads,"
says Cascade's CEO.  (Wall Street Journal 30 Oct 95 B3)<p>

ORACLE AND AT&T OFFER BUSINESSES INTERNET PACKAGE: AT&T's
WorldNet Managed Internet Service,
which assists businesses ingetting on the Internet, will team up
with Oracle Corp., using Oracle's WebSystem software
to create and display pages on the World Wide Web. (Wall Street
Journal 30 Oct 95 B3)  Oracle's WebServer not only
stores, manages and distributes Web data, but is also tightly
linked with its Oracle 7 database program which is used
in about half the corporate databases worldwide.  "Our software
will take the Web from a system for
sharing files to one for building real client-server

BIG BROTHER IS STILL WATCHING: FBI REQUESTS MUCH LARGER
WIRETAPPING CAPABILITY The
Federal Bureau of Investigation wants Congressional approval for
a plan that would increase its wiretapping about
2,000% from current capabilities,  giving it the ability to
monitor as many as 1 in every 100 phone lines in certain
high-crime areas.  In contrast, fewer than 1 in 174,000 phone
lines received court-authorized taps in recent years. The
FBI says the plan is "absolutely essential for law enforcement
and public safety."  (New York Times 2 Nov 95 A1)<p>

INTEL INTRODUCES PENTIUM PRO: Intel is introducing its new
Pentium Pro chip, which it hopes will be the key
to penetrating the profitable computer workstation market.  The
chip requires a 32-bit operating system in order to
achieve high performance levels.  (New York Times 2 Nov 95 C2)<p>

NOT SO FAST THERE:  COMPAQ FINDS GLITCH IN CHIP: Compaq officials
say they will delay shipment of
Pentium Pro-based machines  for a few week because  they found it
is too fast for some older network cards.  "The
network slows down, or it completely drops clients off the
network," says a Compaq executive.  Intel agrees that Pentium
Pro-based servers don't do well when older network connection
cards are installed but says that "if you have a new
machine and a new card, there's no problem." (Houston Chronicle 2
Nov 95 C1)<p>

NEW YORK TIMES CORRECTS WIRETAP STORY: Correcting its front page
story on the FBI's plans for expanding
national wiretapping capability (New York Times 2 Nov 95 A1;
Edupage 2 Nov 95), the newspaper says the plan would
allow monitoring of 1 in every 1,000 phone lines (not every 100,
as mistakenly reported).  In a letter to the Times from
FBI director Louis Freeh says, "We have not and are not asking
for the ability to monitor 1 out of every 100 telephone
numbers or any other
ridiculous number like that.  To obtain that many court orders
and conduct that extent of wiretapping would be nearly
impossible."  (New York Times 3 Nov 95 A1,A14)<p>

MAC CLONE OUTSHINES MAC: The speediest PC running the Macintosh
operating system these days is made by
Power Computing Corp., the first company licensed to churn out
Mac clones.  Power Computing says Apple's comparable
machine -- the Power Machintosh 9500 -- is as much as 20% slower
than the PowerWave 604/150.  It's also more
expensive, by about $1,700.  "We are much smaller, so we're much
quicker than Apple is," says Power Computing's CEO. 
The company says it's on track to sell 100,000 clones during its
first year of production, which ends in May.  (Information

VIRUS-BLOCKER: McAfee Associates has a new product called WebScan
that identifies
virus-tainted programs before they're downloaded and warns the
user not to continue.  Security experts say WebScan
is the first product that prevents viruses from infecting a

after it's already occurred.  (Wall Street Journal 6 Nov 95

GMAT GOES DIGITAL: Next year students taking the Graduate
Management Admissions Test will trade in their No.
2 pencils for computers at colleges and Sylvan Learning Systems
Inc. test centers.  The computerized version of the test

WEBMASTERS IN GREAT DEMAND: A Web Week survey reports that
"Webmasters at big companies generally enjoy
responsibility, authority and respectable remuneration."  The
typical webmaster is male (87.5%), in his 30s (55%), earns
more than $45,000 a year (57.5%), and often more than $65,000 a
year (37.5%).  Rather than being nerdy troglodytes
who emerge from their dens only for another meal of nachos, Cheez
Whiz and Jolt cola, Web Week found that many
webmasters play a
leading role in developing their companies' online strategies. 
And many of them don't like the name "webmaster,"
suggesting instead webmeister, webmasochist, or "all-knowing and
-seeing ruler of time, dimension and space" as
alternatives.  (Tampa Tribune 6 Nov 95 A2)<p>

PBS ONLINE: The Public Broadcasting Service plans to build 200
Web sites linking its 347television stations by next
March.  PBS will provide space on its national server for all
stations, but each station is developing its own Internet
strategy, and individual stations have the option of using their
own on-site computers and in-house staff to produce Web
pages.  About 56 stations currently have their own home pages.

WINDOWS 95 PENETRATION AT 6%: A survey of 1,201 households by
market research firm Odyssey shows that
Windows 95 is running computers in 6% of PC households.  But
while 92% of respondents had heard of Windows 95, only
10% said it was likely they'd be buying the new program -- 53%
said it was extremely unlikely they'd be switching from
their current operating system.  The survey also found that 22%
of Windows 95 households had signed up for Microsoft

CAN AFRICA COME FROM BEHIND ON THE INTERNET? Only 12 of Africa's
54 countries now have a link to the
Internet, but that doesn't mean the rest can't catch up quickly. 
World Bank official Peter Knight says that "Africa
doesn't have huge investments in copper wiring, and in sense that
is to its advantage.  They can go straight into things
like fiber optics and wireless communications, and if they do it
right,overnight they can be pretty close to the leading
edge."  (New York Times 17 Nov 95 A8)<p>

SOFTWARE PIRATE NABBED IN L.A.: A big-time software pirate was
arrested in Los Angeles last week and
charged with two felony counts of fraud and trademark violations. 
Authorities
seized an estimated $1 million in illegally copied software,
high-speed duplicating equipment and $15,000 in cash. 
Thomas Nick Alefantes, who calls himself "Captain Blood,"
allegedly sold his wares through advertising in trade

APPLE, SAGAN MAKE PEACE: Apple Computer and astronomer Carl Sagan
have reached an "amicable" settlement
over Apple's use of Sagan's name as an internal project
code-name.  When Sagan objected last year, Apple renamed the
project "BHA," allegedly short for "Butt-Head Astronomer."  Sagan
then sued for defamation of character, lost the case
and appealed.  The settlement ends the legal wrangling, and both
sides say they're happy.  (Wall Street Journal 16 Nov

<b><h3><center>Zip Drive Reviewed</b></h3>
<p><img src="redline.gif"></center><p>
Iomega's new Zip drive is a stylish piece of blue hardware that
is both versatile and affordable.<p>

Zip is an external storage device available in two versions: a
parallel-port version for PCs and a SCSI version that works on
either a PC or a Macintosh.
Its special removable disks, which are only slightly larger than
3.5-inch
floppies, are capable of storing a whopping 100 megabytes of data
each. You
can take them with you, store them out of the way when you're not
using them,
and transfer information between machines with them. Best of all,
since the
disks only cost around 20 bucks, adding another 100 megabytes of
storage
space whenever you need to is no big deal.<p>

While the Zip Drive isn't as fast as today's hard drives, its
average
seek time of 29 milliseconds and 60-megabyte-per-minute
throughput (20
megabytes per minute on the parallel-port version) come close
enough. The
convenience and the space I save on my hard drive make the
performance hit
worth it.<p>

Available for PC and Macintosh; $199.95 estimated retail for
drive and one
storage disk, $19.95 for each additional disk; from Iomega; (800)
697-8833,
(801) 778-1000.<p>

<b><h3><center>Phase Change Drive</b></h3>
</center><p>
<center><img src="brassbar.gif"></center><p>
CD-ROM drives provide an efficient way to distribute 650MB of
data; but if
you want to record large files yourself, you need a CD recorder,
which runs
from $2,000 to $5,000. Now Matsushita, through its Panasonic
subsidiary; and also marketed by TORAY of America, presents you
with another option, the Phase Change Drive. It plays standard
discs and records onto optical cartridges.<p>

The mechanism works both as a quad-speed compact disc reader,
with a
600MB-per-second data transfer rate, and as a magneto-optical
device for
recording data to an optical cartridge. The phase change drive
fits into a
normal-size drive bay in any PC. The drive tray accepts both
optical
cartridges and regular CD-ROMs, without caddies.<p>

These drives sold for around $800-$1,000 when they first hit the
market a few months ago. You can now find them for about
$600-$650. Panasonic's technology reduces the costs by using a
magneto-optical recorders currently list for much more.
Panasonic's
technology reduces costs by using one laser to record data,
instead of a
magneto-optical drive's combination of a laser and magnetic
subsystem.
Panasonic has also developed a more sensitive disc media that a
low-power
laser can record to. The same laser also reads the CD-ROM<p>. 

Like CDs, the phase change optical cartridges hold up to 650MB;
unlike CDs,
you can erase and reuse the optical cartridges. The optical
cartridges encase
a reflective polycarbonate disc in a plastic sheath. The blank
media should
sell for around $50.<p>
The drives do not record onto standard compact discs or to the
blank CD media
marketed for CD recorders.<p>

<b><h3><center>Windows Programmers You Love to Hate</b></h3></center><br>
<center><h4>By Mark Lautenschlager</center></h4><p>
<center><img src="bargold.gif"></center><p>
It was only a few columns ago when you read my ranting and raving
about careless Windows programmers who didn't bother to check,
during the install process, and see whether or not you had a
later version of some library or device driver than the one they
shipped with their program. Instead, they would slam-dunk the
version they were shipping over the top of what you had,
frequently breaking other things in your computer system.<p>

I called the process "installation retrograding," and allowed as
how any Windows programmer who admitted to the practice in my
presence was going to receive a punch in the nose. Time marches
on, as time will do, and now I have a new whipping post in the
Stupid Human Tricks category.<p>

This time, I'm out to get the executives, probably in marketing,
who decided to put those misleading stickers on the boxes of
Windows 3.1 programs. You've seen them: Works With Windows 95!,
Runs great on Windows 95, or the even more vague For Windows 3.1
AND Windows 95. They even change the boxes themselves to include
System Requirements for Windows 95.<p>

How about a little truth in advertising? I'd love to see a box
sticker that said something like this:<p>

Okay, we freely admit this isn't a 32-bit Windows 95 program.
But we just haven't had time to learn Windows 95 programming
yet, and we don't want to be left out of the hoopla. So we've
tested this program on Windows 95, and although it slows the
system down like any 16-bit program will, we don't think it
will crash. At least not very often.<p>

In the meantime, look for the Microsoft Windows 95 Logo seal. It
carries the words "Designed For" over the Windows 95 logo and the
words "Microsoft Windows 95" underneath it. This assures you the
program you're buying is a 32-bit native Windows 95 application,
ready to be preemptively multitasked and uninstalled, should it
turn out to be 32-bits of junk.<p>

And tell the nimrods in marketing that we're on to them!

<title>HP Laserjet 5l</title>

<h3>Hewlett Packard LaserJet 5L: The Laser vs Bubblejet Dilemma
Continued</h3>
Martin P. Waterman<p>

Last week I was at a one of those large warehouse electronics outlets.  In the section that was full
of  computer printers I was witness to a customer having a salesman expound on various printer
features in the great Bubblejet vs LaserJet debate.   I could not help but ponder in how many
stores,
in how many cities, towns and homes this same debate must be raging.   I knew that I also
pondered
the same question as have many of my friends.  The last time a debate was so encompassing was
that
"less filling" vs "tastes great" episode.<p>

The Laser Printer has always been a coveted prize.  When their first appeared their price and
prestige
was almost beyond measure.  Now, often at about $ 600.00 a pop, laser printers have become
affordable.  In the last issue, I reviewed the color HP Deskjet 660C.  This issue, I review the HP
5L. 
I had looked forward to this review because, I needed to know which type of printer was best for
my
needs.  With so many Editor's Choice Awards and other kudos, it is not a question if the HP 5L is
a good printer.  It cost about a third more than the Bubblejet and there were also hidden costs for
both printers to be considered.<p>

<b>The Installation:</b><p>

The 5L was the easiest printer I had ever installed and although HP claims that the printer is " the
industry's easiest laser printer to install and use, with a setup time as quick as 15 minutes." I had it
up and running in about half that time. The printer has only one button.  I plugged in the power
cord,
hooked up the cable and then shut off the computer since that is what the instructions specified
when
using Windows 95.  I turned on the computer and it notified me it had found a new printer.  It
prompted me to put in the software and viola, I was printing a few minutes later. <p>

This is the sort of plug-and-play performance and ease that was promised with new hardware and
Win
95.  Other installations were not so smooth.  I recently installed a double speed CD-ROM in the
same
computer that can only be described as a plug-and-pray operation.<p>

<b>The Features</b>: <p>

The HP 5L printer is touted as being for small businesses/ home office market (SOHO) but has
also
found a home among those who appreciate high quality printing.  This model was designed for
fast,
high volume printing and features 600 x 600 dots-per-inch (dpi) output.<p>

The 5L does not look like your traditional box-style laser printer.  The slim vertical design takes
up
less space and it is the first  LaserJet to  feature HP's new PrintSmart, a suite of technologies that
delivers faster and easier printing for Windows users. <p>

This was one of the first things I noticed about the printer.  Even with a Pentium, print jobs with
the
color Bubblejet would slow the computer considerably, even with straight black output.  Not so
with
the 5L which did not slow or interrupt my work.<p>

One of the reasons to choose a LaserJet is for the superior print quality. I do a number of
newsletters
and the true 600 x 600 dpi printing without the loss of performance experienced in other printing
technologies is a big advantage. Improvements to HP's Resolution Enhancement technology (REt)
result in smoother, sharper curves and greater clarity for text and graphics. This technology
produces
a print. quality that goes beyond the traditional dpi benchmark, providing very high quality
printing. 
In fact, one of the newsletter's that I had outputted had the guy who does my printing thinking it
was
800 dpi or higher.<p>

I was surprised that the printer proved to be so economical.  The cost per page is less than two
cents,
and EconoMode brings the cost down to one cent per page by reducing the toner used. The
printer
also can use a wide rage of paper types and weights including recycled stock.<p>

Another thing I liked very much about the LaserJet was the faster performance.  Four to six pages
per minute has me spoiled compared to the output speed of the Bubblejet.  Often, I need to print a
letter, a resume and other documents quickly in order to get them out in the day's mail.  I don't
like
waiting five minutes for documents to print while my computer slows down..<p>

Part of the fast speed is  the result of HP's Enhanced LaserJet Printing System for Windows as
well
as HP's exclusive no-wait fuser technology, which allows a document's first page to print without
the
warm-up time needed by other laser printers. These technologies enable a first-page-out time of
just
20 seconds, increasing the printer's output performance beyond its engine-speed specification. 
<p>

Another factor that speeds the printing is HP's Memory Enhancement technology provide that
permits
faster printing of complex documents and a quicker return to application. These speed
enhancements,
along with a faster processor and accelerated I/O handling, are designed to  save small-business
customers time and money. <p>

The printer is also Energy Star certified for low power consumption, with a PowerSave sleep
mode
that conserves even more power when the printer is not being used.  The LaserJet 5L printer
features
a 100-page input and output trays that  accommodate a wide range of media, such as postcards
and
envelopes. A single-sheet feeder allows customers to print special media without removing other
media from the input tray, while an alternative straight-paper path ensures wrinkle-free printing of
envelopes, labels, special stock and transparencies. You can also can stack up to 10 envelopes or
sheets of  custom media in the main paper tray. The printer has a 4,000-page monthly duty cycle.
<p>

<b>The Verdict:</b><p>

After testing the color Bubblejet, I decided to purchase one.  At times I have wondered if I made
the
correct choice.  If you have kids, then a color printer is a must particularly since most like paint
and
draw programs. While the laser was hooked up I missed being able to do color such as for a
Valentines Day Card.  <p>

Another thing I very much liked about the color printer was I could do a demo or a proof to a
customer of what their flyer, newsletter or business cards would look like.  However, the
resolution
for the Bubblejet was not as crisp as the laser.  I really liked the speed and that the printer was
easy
on the computer's resources. The lower cost for output was also appreciated.  In hindsight, I wish
I would have purchased the laser since the far majority of my output does not require color.  Also,
since I do some desktop publishing, the quality was a big plus. <p>

<p>

Of course, my friends who have young children think I made the best choice as they are always
sending over disks so I can print their color drawings for them.  Ultimately, I would like both
printers. 
The cost of both is but a fraction of what a laser used to cost, however, my priority in computer
expenditures would probably be for more memory unless business justified the purchase.<p>

<h3>Four Tax Preparation Programs Reviewed</h3>
<p>

Here comes tax time right around the old corner. Taxes affect us all each and every day in many
ways, but we all seem to think that April is the hardest month and April 15th the worst day of the
year.  The old saying goes that nothing is certain but death and taxes and we regard them both
with
equal dislike and dread. Our computers can't help us live longer (at least not yet) but they can help
us quite a bit when it comes to tax time.<p>

With the help of tax-preparation software, your computer can calculate how much your tax bill
comes
to, or better yet, how much you'll get back from the IRS.  Tax preparation software makes
completing your returns not only easier but more cost-effective. The programs act as electronic
administrators, catching mistakes and ensuring a more accurate return. They also often point out
missed exemptions or overlooked deductions; which could result in sometimes minimizing what
you 
have to fork over to Uncle Sam.<p>

If you keep your financial records and checkbook on your computer using a program such as
Quicken, Microsoft Money or Kiplinger's Simply Money, it makes perfect sense to computerize
your
tax filing as well. Most tax-prep programs will import information, such as expenses or income,
from
on-screen financial managers, saving you time and making it easier to fill out the forms.<p>

OK, you're the type of person who cringes when you think about the IRS. You want nothing to
do
with taxes more than handing your accountant a shoe box overflowing with receipts and W-2
forms,
signing the completed papers, licking the stamps and dropping everything off at the post
office?<p>

Tax-preparation software can also help you; it'll organize your records more efficiently, enabling
you
to give your tax preparer everything they need to get the job done fast. Completing your return
using
a tax preperation software program and then having your accountant review and correct it,
instead
of asking him or her to start from scratch can save you money (anywhere from 30 to 80 percent
off
an accountant's fee).<p>

Using tax-preparation software is not a new thing, many taxpayers are already sold on it. In 1993,
software publishers sold 2.8 million copies of tax-preparation software for federal and state
income
taxes, according to the Software Publishers Association (SPA) in Washington. For the first half of
1994, tax software developers sold 1.7 million units, a 24 percent jump over the same period in
1993.
Intuit, the developer of TurboTax, estimates that 3 million of us will use tax software to prepare
returns this year.<p>

Tax software clearly sells. But do the programs deliver? We decided to look at Can they really the
four top-selling tax-preparation programs (Parsons Technology's Personal Tax Edge, 4Home
Productions' Simply Tax, MECA Software's TaxCut and Intuit's TurboTax). We used the
Windows
versions, but three of the four programs are also available in other formats. All four programs are
updated each year and take into account the current tax rates and laws as provided by the IRS.
They
include all the forms and schedules you'll need to file. And, to varying degrees, they contain tips
and
advice that will alert you to mistakes, uncover deductions and warn you if certain decisions are
likely 
to trigger that dreaded audit.<p>

<p>

The ways in which the programs convey this information varies, but certain features are common
to
all. For example, all use a system of alerts, warning you as you go if you're filling out the forms
inaccurately. For instance, TaxCut explains that low-balling your income can backfire if people in
your occupation generally make a lot more than the figure you report. In addition to on-screen
advice
while completing the return, the programs offer review functions to scan your completed return
for
missed deductions, possible audit flags and ways in which you can lower your tax bill. All offer at
least two ways to handle the tax-preparation process: an "interview mode," which asks you
questions
and then plugs your answers into the appropriate line on the appropriate forms; and a "forms
mode,"
which lets you fill in the forms yourself. Some tax-preparation software includes supplemental
advice
and information. As an example, Simply Tax incorporates tax tips from The Ernst &amp; Young
Tax-Saving Strategies Guide (John Wiley &amp; Sons). The CD-ROM version of TurboTax
includes
advice from Marshall Loeb, former managing editor of Money, editor-at-large at Fortune and
author
of Marshall Loeb's Money Guide, and Mary L. Sprouse, author of The Money Income
Handbook.<p>

Finally, all four developers offer to pay  any IRS penalties related to computation errors in the
software (of course, they won't pay for any errors or mistakes you made in claiming income etc.).
And should you be audited after using TaxCut, a tax professional from H &amp; R Block will be
assigned
to help you prepare for the IRS hearing and will accompany you at no additional cost, regardless
of
whether the audit was triggered by your use of the program.<p>

To put the programs through their paces, we developed a complex but typical tax scenario for a
fictitious family of four: John and Mary Doe and their two children, Fred, 16, and Debbie, 9.
Mary,
an internet consultant has a home-based business with a 1994 gross income of $35,000. Her office
expenses are fairly typical: telephone, advertising and promotion, meals and entertainment, and so
on.
Her husband, a State worker, earned $50,000 in 1994. The couple's two dependent children are
still
in school, but both have savings accounts. The Does own a home, which they bought in 1988 for
$200,000. <p>

The family's tax situation covers typical topics for a middle-income family: interest and dividend
income on investments, home-office deductions, charitable contributions, a mortgage deduction
on
their home and interest income from each family member's savings account. We also had Mary
make
the maximum contribution to a Self-Employed Pension/Individual Retirement Account (referred
to
in tax lingo as an SEP/IRA).<p>

The software we reviewed was beta, or pre-release, versions of the programs. The government
often
makes changes in the tax laws right up until the end of the year, and tax programs can't be
finalized
until all the new laws are in place. (Complete and updated versions are usually available to
consumers
by late January or early February.) <p>

The result? Even though the version of TurboTax that we reviewed was missing a good deal of its
tax-help information, we liked it best of the four programs. TurboTax's straightforward
explanations
and its ability to lead taxpayers by the hand through the the tax-preparation process made it seem
like
a CPA was doing the return. TaxCut finished right behind TurboTax. Although TaxCut's easy
data
entry features and on-screen tax help were quite good, it lost points for poor manuals, both for
the
program and for tax preparation. Personal Tax Edge came in third while Simply Tax was just as
simply awful as it was in last year's reviews.<p>

<p>

If you're comfortable using your computer, then there is no reason why you can't complete your
return using one of these programs. One other nice plus is the time factor. The Internal Revenue
Service estimates that it took an individual taxpayer about seven hours and 24 minutes to
complete
and file Form 1040 for 1993 (including time spent reading up on how to complete the form), and
that
doesn't include preparing any additional forms. In 1988, the first year the IRS tracked preparation
time, the figure was only six hours.  Using the software to prepare a return took much less time
that
the IRS average; from one hour to five hours and 45 minutes to prepare the returns for our
fictional
family. <p>

<h3>Individual Reviews:</h3>
<b>Simply Tax</b><p>

Simply Tax is simply awful. It has a busy look that, when coupled with its disjointed
question-and-answer, or "interview," process, makes it both unattractive and difficult to use. The
program was cluttered and confusing and we give it a big thumbs down. While the program has
some
good points for innovative ideas  it seemed to them to be an experiment gone awry. Our main
complaint centered on the program's complex on-screen presentation. For example, in the
"interview
mode" (which in other programs is typically the easiest way for users to enter data), the program
confronts you with two windows: one containing the interview question, another with background
information on that question. After you answer the question, a "What Now" window pops up and
tells you what to do next or adds further details to the question and/or background
information.<p>

Computer Associates, which makes the program, calls this "context- sensitive help," but we felt it
was
too much - bombarding the user with all the windows, questions and information.<p>

Like other programs we tested, Simply Tax is designed as an on-screen notebook with tabs at the
side
of the screen. The tabs include such items as Welcome, Last Year, Import, Interview, Pathfinder,
Validation, Tax Savings, Filing and Cleanup; an icon view bar, which opens and closes windows
such
as Tax Form, Interview, Explanation, IRS Instructions, The Ernst &amp; Young Tax-Saving
Strategies
Guide 1995 and What Now; the icons themselves;  two ways of preparing a return (interview and
forms); and pull-down menus above the icons. It sound confusing and it was confusing. <p>

The interview process had neither rhyme nor reason to it. Instead of asking questions in a logical
fashion (by tax-form line or topic, for example), the program asks questions in seemingly random
order. And if that's not disorienting enough, Simply Tax repeats questions several times in the
interview process. <p>

Another poor feature was movement through the program. One touch of the Tab key or click of
the 
mouse doesn't move you to the next data field; often, you must do both. Overall, don't buy this
one. <p>

<b>TaxCut</b><p>

TaxCut finished second-best in our tests. It had a straightforward approach that avoids coming
across
as either patronizing or overly simplistic. In contrast,  "TurboTax was very remedial. It seemed to
cater more to the complete idiot in terms of taking your hand and really leading you through it.
Although TaxCut came up second against TurboTax, the main difference between the two
programs
was the printed manuals for both the program and tax preparation. TaxCut's lower overall score
was
due to "skimpy."  tax documentation, which measures how much information the program
provides
about tax-return preparation, and program documentation, which explains how to use the
software. <p>

TaxCut had great audit alarms and data input. The program's audit feature evaluates your finished
return and prepares a report telling you what information is missing, pointing out possible
problems
and giving tax-saving suggestions. From the report, you can go directly to the related area on the
appropriate tax form to correct the problem.<p>

The program uses a file-folder analogy it calls "The Navigator." Each folder has a name
tab--Start,
Q&amp;A, Forms, Review, Audit and so on--and you simply click on the tab to enter the section.
Everything is exceptionally well organized and laid out very logically. <p>

Another nice feature was the ability to remove the program from your hard disk after tax season,
but
not before it prompts you to leave behind a copy of your completed tax return. This way, all you
have
to do the next year is install the latest version, and you don't have to worry about the program
eating
up disk space all year long.<p>

<b>Personal Tax Edge</b><p>

Personal Tax Edge finished third overall in our tests, largely because it provided users with too
little
information about the types of deductions they could take. It's very straightforward, but doesn't
go
out of its way to make things easy for the user. Personal Tax Edge received its highest grades for
flagging audit problems and ease of use.<p>

While Personal Tax Edge was easy to use, it has plenty of room for improvement. The program's
inability to highlight and type over numbers (you have to backspace over mistakes) was a pain,
and
the audit flagging missed some key deductions that it should have flagged as potentially a
problem.
One nice feature was the ability to compare the returns of a couple filing jointly or separately,
without
having to fill in the same data twice. This feature lets couples easily see which filing status results
in
a lower tax bill. The on-screen checklist of possible audit problems, which users can scroll for
ideas
about how to prepare a better return--and avoid a meeting with the IRS was also a nifty
feature.<p>

One potentially serious problem that should be fixed by the time you buy the program in stores
involves the way in which Personal Tax Edge calculated home-office space. The program used
.05
percent in its calculations rather than the correct 5 percent.<p>

<b>TurboTax</b><p>

Using a fill-in-the-blank technique, the EasyStep Interview asks for key facts and figures about
your
business or personal situation. The Interview has built-in smarts; for example, it won't ask you a
series
of questions if they don't apply. Your progress is tracked by the Information Navigator, which
prompts you when you leave out important items. A great audit flagging feature alerts you to
potential probelms with deductions you have entered.<p>

You'll find all the major IRS business publications available at a mouse click as well as Tax Savvy
for
Small Business by tax attorney Fred Daily. TurboTax for Windows is available in both a disk and
deluxe CD-ROM version. It includes everything you need to prepare your return and file whether
you're a sole proprietor or an ordinary taxpayer The EasyStep Interview leads you through the
process, fills out the forms as you provide the information, questions and prompts as you go
along,
does all the calculations, and then checks everything before you print the return.<p>

<p>

The Tax Center feature in TurboTax Deluxe provides a video library of more than 90 outstanding
videos that feaure Marshall Loeb and Mary Sprouse on such topics as family, investments,
vehicles,
house/rental, and business issues. <p>

The Tax Library includes How to Pay Zero Taxes by Jeffrey Schnepper, the Money Income Tax
Handbook by Mary L. Sprouse, 30 IRS publications, and a section on tax strategies that make this
aspect of the program a gold mine of help and information. <p>

TurboTax even color codes information appearing on the forms so you'll know whether you or
the
program entered it or whether the details were transferred from a federal to a state return. The
program allows you to print your return on plain paper and the Final Review feature verifies that
everything is in the right place.<p>

With all these features it's easy to see why Turbo Tax was selected again this year as the best
tax-preparation software program.<a href="http://www.adobe.com/Apps/PageMaker/"></a><p>

<h3>Broderbund's "The Amazing Writing Machine" and "James
Discovers Math"</h3>
Ted Wood<p>

Kids love computers. Kids hate homework. Unfortunately, it's a fact of life that rarely can we get
kids
interested in computers and homework at the same time. Now, from Broderbund (the company
that
brought us the award winning "Printshop" series) come two new programs which aim to make
homework as fun as using a computer.<p>

<p>

<b>The Amazing Writing Machine (AMW)</b><p>

<i>System Requirements:</i> 386/33mhz (486 recommended) running Windows 3.1 or higher, 4
MB RAM,
SVGA, Double Speed CD ROM, 11 MB Hard Disk space<p>

The Amazing Writing Machine (AMW)  is designed as a tool to get kids to write more. And write
more they do, and more, and more, and more. With the help of this program, kids can create
diaries,
notebooks, stories, letters, poems, and so on. Although any word processor allows kids to create
these sorts of projects, few are as fun as this one.<p>

AMW is an interactive word processor. It comes up with hints and "bright ideas" for kids to use
in
developing their work. A collection of famous quotes, facts, and even riddles are included to help
push kids to really develop their writing projects. There is even a secret code feature which allows
kids to send "secret messages" to one another.<p>

The layout options are incredibly fun to use. The program comes with a large variety of design
templates and project which allow kids to plug in their own graphics and text without the worry
of
using more advanced (and complicated) layout tools. Kids can paint and illustrate their stories
with
the Kid Pix painting tools .<p>

AMW is really an excellent way to get kids to spend a lot more time on their homework and enjoy
doing it. OK, so it may be recommended for ages 6-12, but I know of at least one 25 year old
who
had a great time working with it!<p>

<b>James Discovers Math</b><p>

<i>System Requirements:</i> 386DX or higher running Windows 3.1x, 4 MB RAM, Double
Speed CD-ROM, SVGA, Windows compatible sound device<p>

James Discovers Math is a really nice attempt at getting younger children interested in math. It's
chock-full of learning activities from Sing along, games, and puzzles. The basic core of the
program
is a group of ten skill building activities designed to make math more interesting to kids age 3-6
years.<p>

James, a little English boy, is your guide through this program. James is a happy guy, singing,
smiling,
laughing and talking to kids as they navigate the different exercises. If you are slow in responding
to
questions, James will prod you along, answer correctly, and he cheers. Answer wrong, and he's
still
your friend.<p>

<p>

The ten skills James tries to teach kids are: Addition and Subtraction, Counting, Estimation,
Measurement, Number Recognition, Pattern Matching, Problem Solving, Scale, Shape
Recognition,
Sorting, Spatial Visualization, and of course, Telling Time.  Each activity is geared towards
teaching
kids one or more of the skills at a time and they all do a good job of it.<p>

Through music and interaction kids can really pick up a good deal of skills from this program.
After
a short time though, they may tend to lose interest as the games get repetitive and James gets to
be
irritating in his cheerfulness. To some kids, there's nothing worse than another giggling kid telling
you
it was OK to get something horribly wrong. Turning off the sound won't help either, since tips
and
instructions are contained in James chit-chat with the players.<p>

I'd recommend this to anyone hoping to increase their childrens'interest in math, but don't expect
their
interest in this program to last long. It's a good starting point, but it should be followed up by
another
advanced program.<p>

<h3><i></i>Adobe PageMaker 6.0 for Windows 3.1 &amp; 95</h3>
Martin P. Waterman<p>

Without beating around the bush, this program is going to cost you. <p>

The first hit, if you purchase the full version will be about five hundred dollars depending on
where
you purchase the software.  If you survive the first financial blow, be prepared that you may have
to
upgrade your hardware to run the beast.  Adobe PageMaker 6's recommended requirements are a
Pentium or greater processor, Microsoft Windows 95, 16 MB or more RAM, 40 MB of Hard
Drive
Space, High-resolution 24-bit or greater Super VGA or XGA and a CD-ROM drive.  It will run
on
a lot less but if you want to create graphic intensive documents or have more than one application
open be prepared for life in the slow lane.<p>

PageMaker has sold over a million copies in 31 languages and is the world's leading page layout
software.  This is a high end Desktop Publishing Program with all the bells whistles and powerful
tools to create dazzling documents. <p>

Many of the magazines for which I write are created using PageMaker.  More importantly, most
of
the presses that I use also use also use PageMaker. Personally, this saves me a great deal of
money
on output devices since the printers can take my disks and print to output devices far beyond my
budget, and in many instances go directly to negatives or plates.   One of the main reasons I chose
PageMaker over its counterparts being Corel Ventura and Quark was the fact that in this area at
least,
PageMaker is what is used by the printing industry.  <p>

Consistent with so much of the software market, the high end DTP products are quite similar with
each one adding a few new tools and eclipsing the other with each new release.  Xerox's Ventura
has
found nice company now that it has been acquired by Corel.  Conversely, now that Aldus
PageMaker
is in the Adobe family of products this also further strengthens its position in the market.<p>

If  your design requirements are not too elaborate, you can find much less expensive yet versatile
programs in the form of  Microsoft Publisher, PagePlus from Serif, PageMagic from NEBS or
TurboPublisher from IMSI. In  fact, many word processors such as WordPerfect and Microsoft
Word
can produce a pretty mean newsletter and layout.  <p>

<i><b>Making Pages</b></i><p>

I was introduced to PageMaker 5 while producing a seasonal newspaper.  It was an initiation by
fire
and after a friend showed me how to use the 5 most often used tools in a ten minute tutorial I was
on my way.  I found the program easy to use but trying to learn about and master new tools was
difficult because the manuals were hard to understand.  No so with PageMaker 6.  Learning is fun
thanks to the CD tutorial that demonstrates how the features are used.  Many people have asked
me
if PageMaker is difficult to learn.  My stock answer is "No, not if someone is there to show you
how.<p>

The CD-ROM tutorial in not only that someone, it is a group of people knowledgeable on the
working, shortcuts and even expert tips on using this program.  This in itself will save hours of
frustration, manual flipping or worse, the non utilization of tools due to poor documentation. The
manual, though 450 pages in length is also easy to understand.  This is refreshing and I found that
I
looked forward to learning about this program.  The package also comes with a Print Publishing
Guide that does an excellent job at explaining the process of creating color publications.<p>

There are many new tools in PM6.  In the Prepress and Printing category PageMaker has added
an
automatic trapping feature that produces extra clarity.  Trapping adjustments are made
automatically
and compensate for potential gaps between two adjoining colors which occurs more than it should
through misregistration at the printers.  Trapping can also be set manually.<p>

If you create large documents such as catalogs, magazines or even newsletters, you can now
create
multiple master pages.  This allows you to quickly use repetitive design elements throughout your
document.  This was one of the most requested features and if you are able to use this feature will
find the financial sting of the price is well compensated for in the savings of time.  In fact, many of
the new features streamline the process with many new time saving elements.  For instance, the
File
menu now automatically lists the last 8 saves which was a much needed feature.<p>

One of my favorite new features is the Polygon tool which allows for the quick creation of
multi-sided
objects.  Another time saver is the Align Objects Command which allows you to preview and
align
overlapping text, graphics and other objects.  There is also a Group Command which allows you
to
lock a number of elements into a single unit.  This new unit then can be moved and edited but
can't
be deleted.  You can also crop images, text and drawn images right in PageMaker using the
Masking
feature.  If you do a great deal of production work with other people, you can ad non-printing
objects
such as production notes and comments.  Of course, you can also make notes to yourself.<p>

If you are producing full color pages, PageMaker has CMS or Color Management System.  This
allows for a closer representation of the original color of your image from a scanner to the
monitor. 
It is best that you disable CMS until before you need it since it will slow your system dramatically
since it is used each time a screen is redrawn.<p>

Anticipating the future, PageMaker now has a number of tools for on screen publishing.  This is
for
creating documents for CD-ROM Publishing, Home Pages for the Internet (HTML) and shared
documents to be published over a network.<p>

Opening the Adobe PageMaker package was sort of like Christmas.  There was a version of
Adobe
PhotoShop LE, and Adobe Acrobat Distiller PE.  Of course one of my favorite features was the
Kodak Photo CD Mailer where I can send 12 slides or negatives and for $13.95 get them back of
a
Kodak Photo CD ready to use in PageMaker and other applications.<p>

Most editors despise gushy reviews.  However, using the new tools I shaved 10 hours off the
production time of a newsletter I do for a large mining concern.  In addition, the time that was
spent
was less tedious.  I do have some gripes.  PageMaker does have trouble importing some type of
graphics which meant I had to spent time converting them in other program. Usually, I would
import
into Corel Draw and then cut and paste to the Windows clipboard thus creating a WMF or
Windows
Metal File.<p>

You can also create PDF (Portable Document Format) files that can be used across a number of
platforms such as Windows, Macintosh and Unix from inside PageMaker.  Of course this feature
uses
other Adobe technology.  It seems that at every turn Adobe is trying to push their other products
and
technology on you.  Also, for the price, I would have liked to see a bundle with other Adobe
full-fledged products such as PhotoPaint, Illustrator and other higher end Adobe applications 
much
in the same way Corel 5 was bundled and included Corel Ventura and Corel Draw.  They did
include
a disk with more than Adobe typefaces but you have to pay to unlock them.  They do, however,
give
you two packages free for registering although I have trouble being convinced it is a $ 75.00
value.
If you are interested in investigating this program, you can do what I did before I took the 
plunge. 
On the Internet, go to the news group alt.aldus.pagemaker and lurk so that you can follow
thepraises
and criticisms of this product.  It is also an excellent place to get your questions answered by a
large
community of users and DTP professionals. If you are interested in high end DTP another good
group
is comp.publish.prepress.  All the important DTP programs are discussed in this group.  Of
course,
on the WWW you can also visit Corel Ventura at <a href="http://www.
corelnet.com/corelnet/corel/products/ventura6.htm">http://www.
corelnet.com/corelnet/corel/products/ventura6.htm</a>, Quark Express at <a

<h3>Working with MacInTax</h3>
Tiff Bailey<p>

This year there are fewer tax preparation programs on the market due to consolidations and buy
outs.
For Macintosh computers one popular program is MacInTax from Intuit.  It comes in two
editions;
plain on three high density disk and a Deluxe edition on CD-Rom. The list price is $39.95 and
$49.95
respectively. State modules are $24.95. Cheaper by mail order, but many over the counter dealers
have an edition with a $5 rebate coupon enclosed. MacInTax  requires System 7 or greater on at
least
a Mac LC with a minimum of 6 MB of Ram and 6 MB available hard disk space. Installing the
Deluxe
edition from the CD requires 18 MB of hard disk space. I ran the Deluxe edition directly from the
CD
drive in a Performa with 8 MB  of RAM and had no problems.<p>

I spent President's Day weekend doing what MacInTax  can't do; the sorting of receipts and
statements from a shoe box. The program uses an interview technique to guide you through the
process of completing the various work sheets, automatically transfering the information to the
appropriate form as you provide the requested information. As you might expect, the CD-ROM
edition is loaded with help screens, sidebar videos and exact IRS publications. <p>

The process can be jump started if MacInTax  was used last year and if you use a financial
package
such as Quicken, also published by Intuit. The instructions call for loading in information from last
year's return before getting information from Quicken. This was not working until I moved last
year's
file from a floppy disk to the same folder where the '95 file was saved. A new file has to be saved
somewhere on the hard drive because the CD-ROM is read only. By double clicking on the saved
'95
tax file I was able to interrupt the interview sessions without starting over. Starting Quicken I
made
an export for use by MacInTax  and saved it in my '95 folder. The Quicken financial files have
certain
files that are designated as being tax related. Based on your situation you can fine tune these
categories to load into specific lines of the tax forms. As the tax form line items may change from
year
to year this may no be worth the effort. I used the default assignments and didn't notice anything
missing.<p>

On one occasion the step by step interview seemed to get out of sync with the form showing on
the
screen. I backed up a few steps, saved the file and normal progress returned. The step by step
method
prompts for saving the file occasionally but I would do it more frequently. When you think you
are
finished or any time you can switch to a forms view or initiate a review by MacInTax.<p>

The programs comes with all the information to file the return via paper, a PC format or 
electronically. I was able to print my return on a dot matrix ImageWriter with satisfactory results.
The
instruction booklet and the program explain the PC format and give details on filing electronically.
There is an additional charge of $14.95 to file electronically via Intuit. The IRS still does not trust
the
computing public. They apparently want another review before the data enters their computers.
Intuit
does this service either directly via modem or via an on-line service such as American Online or
Compuserve. Electronic filing plus automatic deposit will assure a refund within 10 weeks as
opposed
to twenty plus, but it should be worth it. There will still be a form with signatures plus W2's sent
by
snail mail. New York State still expects returns via mail even with their new imaging system.<p>

Some people think they are getting something if they get a big refund, but the IRS pays no
interest
and should not be used as a bank. The IRS expects to have about 90% of your tax bill at the end
of
the year. MacInTax can help check this balance with its tax planning feature. Either the
withholding
amounts can be adjusted or an estimated tax paying schedule can be set up.<p>

Personally, my tax situation is such that I still visit a tax preparer. Use of MacInTax saves some
time
with the tax pro plus I gain confidence that I haven't missed anything. Also the same software
package can be used by other members of the family with less complicated returns.<p>

<h3>Capitalism Reviewed</h3>
Ever since I was a kid I wanted to own a megacorporation; something with huge factories and
fleets of trucks gong cross-country with my family name on their sides, delivering products to
waiting consumers standing inline ready to buy. Sure, the magazine is sort of like that, with
readers from all over the world coming to the web site each month to read what Tri-City 
Computing has to say, but I decided to play the game anyway.<p>

Capitalism from Interactive Magic gave me the chance to be a corporate bigwig. I was able to
build a factory, import my raw materials, set up a sales force and run an advertising campaign on
TV that was more frequent than those annoying infomercials that dot the airwaves late at night. 
But, unfortunately for me,  my products didn't sell and my company came close to ruin. And yet,
I had a great time playing this game.<p>

Capitalism is not Monopoly. It's a  cut-throat supply and demand simulation, that is as detailed as
any business-school textbook. Business is war, and in this battle, you get to pick an
enterprise--from department store or factory to farm or mine or even a newspaper, then determine
a location to begin business and hope you can survive to rise atop your competitors. You must
build inventory, manufacturing, sales, and advertising departments; import goods or resources;
develop marketing plans; improve your company's technology and productivity and most
importantly, outsmart your competitors before they bring you to ruin. You can try your hand in
the stock market (but be careful) and even merge with other companies. And all the while,
computer generated competitors are there workings, conspiring and plotting at your expense;
ready to stab you in the back and take over your holdings at a moments notice. Sounds a lot like
real-life corporate wars doesn't it?<p>

The displays look like SimCity, with multiple windows and maps. Game play is sort of difficult;
you have to plow through a lot of information and delicate options that are all but hidden. Not to
worry, several step-by-step tutorials help you get your company going. <p>

Capitalism will be most enjoyed by those of you out there who have business backgrounds or
revel in details.  But it can be a lot of fun and a great introduction to anyone who wants to know
what it's like to run a corporation and all of the many tasks involved. <p>

 Sure my corporation was lost in a hostile takeover bid, but I was able to pick myself up, start
over and this time I'll use a different marketing strategy and before long I'll build that publishing
empire I always wanted - I hope.<p>

<h3>Busy People's Books</h3>
Ted Wood<p>

Reviews of :<p>

<i>The Internet For Busy People </i>By: Christian Crumlish<p>

<i>Access For Busy People</i> By: Alan Neibauer<p>

Publisher: Osborne/McGraw-Hill<p>

Suggested Retail:  US$22.95<p>

We're all short on time these days. Between work, school, kids, and everything else, there's simply
no time to sit down and study all the latest software. It's simply too difficult to find time to study
up on how the Internet works, or how to get that latest upgrade of Microsoft Access working.
<p>

Now, thanks to the writers at Osborne, there's a new series of books dedicated to our fast paced
lifestyles, the "For Busy People Series." This series is  designed to get you up and running in the
least amount of time with the least amount of technospeak. The layout of these books is generally
the same, each chapter begins with a "Fast Forward" section which cuts right to the chase with
simple information on how to accomplish a given task. <p>

The Fast Forwards are more of a "this is how you complete the task", they're not in depth in any
way. The rest of the chapter deals with "why you had to follow those steps to complete the task."
Each chapter is filled with sidenotes (referred to as Shortcuts, Habits &amp; Strategies,
Definitions,
and Cautions) to help you quickly pick up those small details that you might otherwise miss. The
Cautions are especially useful as are the Shortcuts. All the books in this series are written in a
quirky, and highly opionated tone. Each author puts forth his views of certain applications, ideas,
features and the like adding a wonderfully funny flavor to each chapter. <p>

<b>The Internet For Busy People:</b><p>

The Internet For Busy People serves as an excellent primer for anyone looking to learn about the
Net and some of the more common internet software packages. Starting with an overview of the
Internet, and moving on quickly through email, gopher, and finally the World Wide Web, the
author does an excellent job of informing the reader by keeping the language simple and
straightforward. Veteran net-users won't find much new information in here, but "newbies" will be
glad to have a copy around. <p>

The greatest flaw in The Internet For Busy People is its  lack of any Apple Macintosh 
information. All the software covered deals strictly with Windows (or, more precisely Windows
95) platforms and leaves Macs completely out of the picture. Although the software covered is
available for both Windows and Mac platforms, all the descriptions and illustrations are geared
towards Windows 95 users.<p>

<b>Access for Windows 95 For Busy People: </b>Learning Access is a time consuming task
(some
would prefer the term "chore") that some will never have time for. It's a very powerful and slick
database application that requires a good bit of skill to master, and a good bit of perseverance to
learn.  <p>

Access For Windows 95 for Busy People is a good way to get started on the path to learning
Access 95 and becoming truly proficient with it. The Busy People format of Shortcuts, Fast
Forwards, and Cautions lends itself easily to the subject matter. <p>

This book is definitely a must have for anyone struggling with Access 95. While I'm certainly not
an avid user of Access, this book did quite a bit to help me further my understanding of it. <p>

One of the best things about this book is the heavy use of actual screen shots from Access 95.
Instead of having to slog through lengthy text describing a task, there are handy screen shots that
walk you step by step through the task. With this book being so heavily graphics oriented, I'd
recommend it over buying an expensive videotape  on learning Access. <p>

While it won't make you a master at Access 95, this book does quite a bit to make you more
confident with it.<p>

<title>memory prices falling</title>

<h3>Memory Prices Are Finally Falling As Chipmakers Begin To Catch Up</h3>
Tony Ardito<p>

Prices on memory chips have finally come down after stubbornly refusing to fall at the same rate
as
other computer parts and chips; This stagnation of memory prices has kept computer prices
artificially
high for some time now. <p>

As an example of falling prices, 4 megs of RAM cost about $140 around Christmas, that same
RAM
recently was selling for about $101 and this week I have seen it fall to $80-85. These price drops
were long overdue for consumers whose PCs are starving for memory because of Windows 95,
multimedia and because the cost to purchase RAM has just been too high.<p>

Historically prices had been falling 20-30% per year before the stabilization set in. This yearly
decline
is because manufacturers learn how to make the chips more efficiently. Chipmakers also improve
thier
miniaturization techniques so that the newest generation of chips can pack a lot more circuitry
into
the same amount of space, leading to chips with much better performance features and higher
density
for the same cost as the older, slower chips. When switching to the next generation, prices can
crash
as one or more manufacturers drop prices in an effort to gain market share. <p>

Intel Corp. Recently was the victim of falling prices when it announced that it had bought too
many
memory chips during the 4th quarter and would have to write off the value of the chips by $50 to
$70
milliion. The chips in their stockpile were no longer worth what they had paid for them.<p>

Adding RAM to a computer speeds up its performance and are also necessary to run the latest
multimedia, graphic and sound heavy programs. Prices for RAM have remained high over the last
three years , due in part to a brief period when RAM was in short supply as a result of a chip
factory
in Japan having been destroyed by a fire. And also because of the heavy demand for RAM in the
today's popular multimedia computers.<p>

During this period of  high demand and low production, price actually rose. Average prices per
meg
where $25.31 in 1992, while average prices per meg in 1994 were up to $27.69. So, even though
the
price of hard drives and microprocessors had fallen during the last 3 years, the artifically high
price
of RAM erased most of the benefit to the consumer. <p>

New RAM chip plants have been built and the supply of RAM is high. Some other  reasons for
this
price decline are the fact that AT&amp;T got out of the computer business and dumped a lot of
chips on
the market at dramatically discounted prices. AST Research also miscalculated what kind of chips
would be in demand for Christmas and it was forced to unload a lot of chips. Spot-market prices
on
excess chips sold by brokers and contract prices on bulk chips sold to computer manufacturers
has
also dramatically declined in recent months. In addition the new 16 megabit chips are being
phased
in to replace the older 4 megabit chips.<p>

What remains to be seen is whether the reduction in RAM prices will be passed along to the
consumer
buying a system or if systems prices will remain the same or even rise to compensate for the drop
in
RAM prices. For those of us looking to upgrade existing systems, things look pretty good for the
next few months. I for one plan to make some upgrades while prices are around $20 per meg.<p>

<h3>Get a Job? Professional Assistance for Job Seekers</h3>
Martin P. Waterman<p>

ResumeMaker Deluxe CD hails from Individual Software and is touted as being the # 1 best
selling resume software with
career planning.  At first, I was skeptical about reviewing this software.  Of course, being in an
area where jobs are scarce
I was also suspicious of a program that makes the bold promise off being able to "Get you the
Job" .    <p>

The program was not high on my list to review until a friend who had recently graduated from
business college with a
Diploma in Office Technology saw it on my shelf.  "Just what I needed; a guinea pig!" I thought
to myself so we put the
product through its paces.  Of course, at that time, I had also not realized that the software had
been nominated for several
awards.<p>

This program proved to have both very good and some annoying features.  I will start with the
bad points.  The program
specifies that it will run on either Windows 3.1 or higher or Windows &aelig;95 providing you
have a 386-Based 33 MHZ or
better processor, 8 MB of RAM a Double Speed CD-ROM Drive, 256 VGA Adapter or higher
and a sound card.  I tested
the program on two machines the fastest of which was a Pentium 100 with 16 MB of RAM and a
Double Speed CD ROM. 
All worked well but with all this muscle, the videos ran painfully slow forcing stuttering and long
delays often in the middle
of sentences. This was particularly disappointing because the virtual interview is one of the best
features of this program. 
It exposes you to numerous questions you are likely to be asked along with numerous suggested
answers and their rationale. 
This coaching prepares job seekers for  interviews by exposing them to practically any question
they are likely to encounter,
even inapproprate ones,  so that they can be prepared for any eventuality.  I particularly like the
parts of the interview that
dealt with salary negotiation and the workplace environment and other topics that are difficult but
often come up during an
interview.<p>

I found that when I switched my scxreen rsolution to 1024 x 768 that the video image and sound
improved probably owing
to the smaller screen size. However, it was still jerky at times especiaslly at the beginning.  I have
run CD-ROMS with
similar sized video with little problem.  My video card only has 1 MB of RAM and this may have
contributed to the jerky
motion.  It is unfortunate that the video component of the program does not always run optimally. 
I also ran it on a 486DX
66 with 8 MB RAM also using Windows 95 and the video quality was even worse.  Of course,
there is now a version of this
software on disk without the multimedia which will be appreciated for those without multimedia
capabilities.<p>

On the plus side, the program does an excellent job at providing the tools and even a good
measure of confidence needed
for the job seeker.  This includes step-by-step guides to creating resumes using a wide selection of
formats and focuses. 
Richard Fien, a career workshop expert and author covers 50 essential topics that relate to getting
a job. <p>

The program also includes a  section that guides you on thee creation of cover letters, thank you
letters, follow-up letters and
other types of letters you are likely to require.  Resume writing can be difficult but by choosing
prewritten paragraphs by
experts you can overcome the difficulties that many have putting their thoughts down on
paper.<p>

A full contact manager is also included to help the job seeker keep track of their activities
including contacts, companies,
addresses and appointments.  The program also includes 10 fonts and a career planner.<p>

My friend's verdict on the product - she liked it very much and is using it.  She did up her resumes
and merged the addresses
of the companies for which she was seeking employment right in the program which also includes
a word processor.   <p>

She says the program forced her to consider a number of factors such as accessing her strong
points and learning the latest
job seeking strategies which include the Internet.  "A little user unfriendly but I really like it" said
she.  Giving it the ultimate
endorsement she is recommending to one of her instructors at her Office Technology course to
consider the product as a
teaching aid for the module that includes resume creation and job hunting.<p>

My verdict is that this program does anticipate practically any question and circumstance that a
job seeker is likely to
encounter.  With the exception to the video problems, which were more aggravating than
anything else, I also liked the
program and give it my endorsement because it will help coach and prepare anyone who uses the
CD in the job hunting
process.<p>

<p>

Two other faults I found with this program is that it does not have an unconditional guarantee nor
does it come with a built-in
uninstall utility, two things for which I look whenever I purchase software.  <p>

The above was written about two months ago.  Since that time there has been some changes
worthy of reporting.  Probably
the best news is that the woman who used the product landed a job. In addition, she is still
receiving numerous letters from
firms saying they were impressed with the resume and that they would be keeping it on file for
future consideration.<p>

There has also been some changes to the product.  There is now a ResumeMaker Deluxe CD for
Macintosh making it the
only software of its kind for that platform.  It will have a street price of about $39.95, the same
price as the Windows version. 
<p>

There are also the two resume software options for Windows users; ResumeMaker Deluxe CD is
still available while a new
ResumeMaker with Career Planning on disk is a more affordable version with an anticipated street
price of $19.95. <p>

This is one of the most useful pieces of software I have seen in a while. For anyone seriously
considering a part-time or
full-time job this product may not get you the job your seeking but by giving you proven tools,
assistance and confidence
it will certainly up your chances.   If  you already have a job, this might be the tool to trade up to
bigger and better things.<p>

<title>Think Color</title>
</head>
<body><body background="peach.gif">
<h3>Need To Make An Impression:Think Color! </h3>
By Josephine Soto<p>

So, you're looking for an original way to grab the attention of someone with whom you
correspond.
Or perhaps your company needs an new eye catching brochure that's just a slight bit different than
the tired old look you get from printing on colored paper or using a color printer to highlight your
credentials. You need something original. Of course, it's still your credentials or the merit of your
proposal that's going to make it all sink or swim. Remember, it is the brochure or resume or
proposal
that makes the first impression of who you are or what your company does.<p>

Micro Format has a clever way to embed heat-sensitive liquid crystals into ordinary stationary.
The
"Hot Stuff" color-changing paper works with laser or inkjet printers. You print on Hot Stuff as
you
would on ordinary letterhead. The paper appears to be regular quality stock. However, wherever
your
fingers touch, the paper shifts color. <p>

At first, I looked like I had somehow smeared and faded the page, since the sheet was the teal to
yellow color scheme. But as I watched, the yellow areas quickly returned to the original teal. It
certainly made an impression -- which is exactly what you want to do right?.<p>

<p>

Hot Stuff comes in six colors: gray to white, blue to white, teal to yellow, orange to yellow,
purple
to pink, and green to yellow. The paper can also reveal hidden text and graphics when touched.
This
is done by setting a laser or inkjet printer to a shaded or lighter setting, via the printer's print
driver
or the word processing or graphics application you're using. It usually takes a little
experimentation.<p>

With most laser printers, you will have to use gray paper, since most lasers are gray-scale devices.
For example, you could print a company logo-even using the entire page, since it would be
invisible.
Then, print normally on the same page. When fingers touch the paper, the hidden print becomes
visible. <p>

Obviously, this paper isn't just for business. It would be perfect for greeting card programs like
Print
Shop or even to spice up a resume.<p>

Hot Stuff ($10) comes in 50-sheet packages. The Rainbow Package ($26.95) has 150 sheets, 25
each
of six colors.<p>

Mcro Format has a lot of other cool types of paper as well. One product, as assortment pack of of
most of their papers contains 10 sheets of color ink jet paper (very nice), 3 sheets of super color
gloss
paper, 5 sheets of super color+ (lets you print on both sides of the page, 5 sheets of as really cool
3-D
paper that lets printed images float on the page when viewed with those old 1950's style 3-D
glasses
(while the paper is nice, I can't imagine mailing a pair of those glases along with every brochure,
though it might make folks remember you), and 12 sheets of the hot stuff paper reviewed above,
all
for $15.. <p>

Micro Format:   (800) 333-0549 or (847) 520-4699<p>

<title>accounting programs</title>

<body><body background="peach.gif">
<h3>Four Helpful Accounting Packages Reviewed</h3>
<hr>
Knowledge of daily financial transactions, overall cash flow, and profit and loss projections are
indispensible things to be aware of if you're running a business; especially a home based one. You
really need to know if your billings won't cover the cost of higher home utility bills or insurance
premiums, not to mention all the other miscellaneous expenses that make your business sink or
swim; and you need to know this informaiton prior to sinking.<p>

OK, you didn't do well in that college accounting course and advanced financial calculations are a
nightmare for you to figure out. This doesn't mean you need to hire a high-priced accountant or
full-time bookkeeper to hold your hand. Having access to one of these financial types is fine but
for an investment of $120 to $300 can buy you an accounting program that lets you take charge
of home-business finances in a way that's practically painless. I don't recommend foregoing use of
an accountant or bookkeeper all together, but using one of the packages reviewed here can make
your life easier and allow you to prepare materials much quicker and accurately.  So that when
you do use an accountant for end of year transactions you cost for their time might be less if much
of the documentation has already been prepared prior to handing it over to them.<p>

The six programs profiled here--Great Plains Profit, M.Y.O.B., DacEasy Accounting With
Payroll, Peachtree Accounting, QuickBooks and QuickBooks Pro--are all excellent applications
that will help you keep track of financial transactions for your small business. Each has its own
particular strengths and weaknesses. Peachtree Accounting, for instance, supports a wide range of
inventory options, while M.Y.O.B. offers 99 options from a list to chose exactly what type of
business you are operating. As you read the review,  think about which of these areas is most
important to you and your business, and match the programs' strengths to your particular
needs.<p>

<i><b><p>

1. Setting Up accounts?</b></i><p>

All six programs supply you with a chart of accounts for your particular type of business. For
example, if you produce a product, you'll need to maintain accounts for finished inventory as well
as the raw materials that go into creating that inventory. <p>

Each program asks you to access the chart of accounts that best suits your needs by choosing
your type of business from a list. All of the programs  include enough choices to ensure most
people find either their specific business or an acceptable general entry (such as "consultant" or
"manufacturing"), but as mentioned above, M.Y.O.B. is outstanding in this area. It provides 99
choices, more than three times the number offered by QuickBooks. M.Y.O.B. let me select
"freelance writer" rather than the more generic  "consultant." So I was able to work with income
accounts for writing and royalty revenue, which more accurately reflects my business needs. <p>

Some types of accounts cross almost any business type, whether it's product-or service-related.
Regardless of the business type you select, all six packages set up accounts that support
transaction entries for purchase orders, as well as for credit-card or check purchases. They also
list customer orders, produce invoices and track payment collections.<p>

<p>

M.Y.O.B., Peachtree, QuickBooks and QuickBooks Pro all include guides that make setup easier.
Peachtree provides a graphical accountant to be your on-screen buddy. He explains explains
sticky terms such as accrual accounting as opposed to cash accounting and many other boring
accouting terms and methods. The advice is good and very helpful to both the novice and
knowledgable user. <p>

Once you set up the appropriate chart of accounts in M.Y.O.B., Peachtree, QuickBooks and
QuickBooks Pro, you can add the names of customers or vendors, their addresses, and the
applicable credit terms as needed for a particular transaction.<p>

DacEasy and Great Plains Profit take a different approach: Before you can start recording items
such as sales or purchases, you must set up a roster of your existing clients and vendors, the
amount they owe you or you owe them, and their purchase or sales history. This approach
prevents you from jumping right into either program, however,  Great Plains Profit does a better
job than DacEasy of helping you through the information gathering process.  As an example, a
pop-up entry screens in Great Plains Profit gives examples that help you determine how to classify
vendor groups (wholesaler, retailer and so on); just clicking on the "Next" button in these screens
leads you to the next level of data you'll have to supply.<p>

<p>

<i><b>2. Keeping Track of It All</b></i><p>

All six programs include reporting functions that help you find out if your business is running in
the black or in the red. Each program also supplies balance-sheet reports that present you with a
easy to understand view of business assets, liabilities and capital. Each program also allows you to
generate eports on specific areas of your business; for example, you could run one that provides a
report of your Acounts Receivable, identifying customers whose accounts are past due.<p>

Each of these software packages simplifies justr how you can produce a basic report. Peachtree
for example, lets you click on the Reports tab at the bottom of the screen and then choose an icon
for Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Payroll, General Ledger, Financial Statements,<p>

Job Cost, Account Reconciliation or Inventory. QuickBooks, QuickBooks Pro and Great Plains
Profit provide an alternative to reports by letting you monitor some vital information as graphs.
These charts visually display data such as your income and expenses, net worth, and accounts
payable or receivable..<p>

<p>

<i><b>3. Managing Inventory<p>

</b></i>If your business is one that sells or manufactures products, the goods on hand at the end
of a
given period (most companies typically operate on a monthly basis) are your biggest concern.
Inventory is your greatest asset; you'll need to know its current value to determine the cost of the
goods you sold during the period and your resulting profit.<p>

Be sure to choose accounting software that supports the technique you're already using to value
your inventory on paper. While no one technique is better than another, remember that you're
making a long-term commitment, so it's important to be comfortable with your choice. There are
three main inventory valuation techniques. Say you operate a small craft store and have stocked
up on Christmas tree decoratign kits for the holidays; Great Plains Profit, QuickBooks,
QuickBooks Pro and M.Y.O.B. all will average the cost of the kits you purchased to figure the
value of the inventory on hand. This technique, known as average costing, is the simplest method.
DacEasy offers average costing, plus the option to value those kits you have remaining at the end
of a period based on the most recent units purchased (FIFO, or first in, first out). Peachtree
supports these first two methods as well as a technique to value inventory based on the kit (LIFO,
or last in, first out).<p>

<p>

<b><i>4. Billing for your Time</i></b><p>

Many professionals, such as consultants, writers, archeaolgists, architects and lawyers bill
customers for the time they spend on tasks--making phone calls or preparing legal documents, for
example. Small-business accounting programs build in various features to help you track how you
spend your hours. With QuickBooks and QuickBooks Pro, for instance, you can tally your hours
by turning on Time Tracking in the Preferences menu. A weekly time sheet lets you record the
hours you've spent completing various activities, and charge payroll costs to a particular customer
or job--say, Bob James' divorce case. M.Y.O.B. has a contact log, while DacEasy has a
call-tracker feature that lets you keep track of time spent with a customer for billing purposes.
When you dial a client using DacEasy, the call tracker will even track the number of minutes your
phone conversation lasts.<p>

<p>

<b><i>5. Tracking Job Costs</i></b><p>

All of the programs reviewed have job-costing features. If your a contractor you'll need this
feature to record the costs you incur for materials used at a particular job site. QuickBooks Pro
packs the most impressive set of job-costing features of all of the programs. It allows you build
estimates for customer jobs. Later, it lets you turn them into invoices, including modifications to
accommodate costs that may have exceeded (or failed to meet) original expectations. The
software has all the tools you need to fashion more accurate bids on jobs, show total profitability
by job or activity, and compare estimated job costs vs. actual expenses.<p>

<p>

<b><i>6.  Managing Payroll</i></b><p>

Hiring employees can indicate that your business is beginning to do well. But it can also be a real
pain when having to deal with tax forms such as W-2s and 1099s, and calculating FICA and
federal tax withholding. Depending on your business, other factors may enter into the equation:
Do you pay commissions to a salesperson? Do you have a 401(k) program to help employees
prepare for retirement? Although you can always contract with a service bureau to handle your
payroll, these accounting programs make the task easy enough to consider doing it yourself. For
instance, you can subscribe to a program's payroll tax table updates to get the latest information
about federal and state withholding rates on a floppy disk. M.Y.O.B., for one, offers as many as
four such updates a year in the appropriate electronic format for $29.95 each. By getting these
updates, you'll ensure that you're in compliance with all withholding amounts, even if the rates
change during the year. Some of the programs reviewed do not include full-fledged payroll
capabilities. Great Plains Profit requires that you buy a separate program called Great Plains
Payroll. For a small firm that has straightforward payroll needs, however, any of the programs can
print paychecks with the correct withholding rate, and they'll all keep track of your liabilities for
tax agencies. Peachtree, though, is your best choice if you need to include 401(k) deductions for
pensions, or pay employees whom you define by groups (such as those receiving hourly wages, or
those whom you'd pay for a specific task.This program is also a great choice if you need to track
your employees' pay by customer jobs, or enter vacation time on workers' paychecks. The
software builds in well-rounded features that handle all these options efficiently.<p>

While these programs won't make your business sucessful, they may save you some time. And
since we all know that time is money,  having any extra of it may just let you put more effort into
pursuing business success. <p>

product, called QuickTax 1040A/EZ.<p>

Internal Revenue Service statistics show that 42 percent of all returns filed  for the 1993 tax year
were either 1040A or 1040EZ forms. Most individuals who have less than $50,000 of income
from
wages, salaries, tips, unemployment compensation, interest or dividends and do not have itemized
deductions (example: no home mortgage or independent-contractor expenses) qualify to do a
1040A
or 1040EZ and can use QuickTax.<p>

For taxpayers with more sophisticated needs (i.e., those who itemize deductions and use the 1040
tax
return), Intuit continues to provide TurboTax and MacInTax, America's best-selling individual
and
small-business tax-preparation software, available from retailers or directly from Intuit.<p>

AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE<p>

Internet users need only to visit  Intuit's World Wide Web site to find QuickTax. Customers will
be
able to download the software, which includes more than 30 forms, schedules and worksheets, in
about 6 minutes (using a 28.8-bps modem). QuickTax even includes the IRS extension form for
taxpayers who elect to file after the April 15 deadline.<p>

EASY TO USE:<p>

QuickTax uses an intuitive checklist format that makes completing the tax return easier than ever.
Users answer simple questions about their income and  expenses, and they are then presented with
the appropriate forms for entering the data.<p>

The software does all the calculations, which are guaranteed accurate. If the user pays an IRS
penalty
because of a calculation error in the software, Intuit will pay the penalty and any interest. Once
completed, customers can print their QuickTax 1040A/EZ tax return for mailing to the IRS.<p>

QuickTax works with TurboTax States for Windows, which are available separately for every
state
that has an income tax. Customers also can upgrade to TurboTax next year if their filing needs
become more complex.<p>

QuickTax is available at Intuit's World Wide Web site, which can be found at the following
Internet
address: &lt;<a href="http://www.intuit.com/ quicktax">http://www.intuit.com/
quicktax</a>&gt;. Customers also have the option of obtaining
QuickTax by mail by calling 800/964-1040.<p>

QuickTax will run on any typical 386sx or higher, 486 or Pentium PC with 4MB of memory
running
Windows 95 or Windows 3.1.<p>

<h3>Financial Advice Is As Easy As 123</h3>
Bill Franklin<p>

Unless you're very wealthy you probably spend a lot of time worrying about money. Nagging
financial
questions echo over and over in your head: Am I spending too much of my salary? How can I
afford
that big house? Do my investments make sense? Can I afford my kids' college bills? Will I be able
to
retire to Arizona comfortably? Will my family be financially secure no matter what happens to
me?
These are very tough questions (ones I ask myself every day), and the answers may be elusive for
those of us that aren't experts in the finace department. <p>

Don't fret though, there is help for those of us that were not economic whizs, now you can have
your
own economist/financial consuler under your own roof (and no, you don't need a spare room for
this
guy). A wealth of  financial programs featuring the sage advice of financial professionals lets you
gather the information you need to make sound decisions about your money. With just a few
clicks
of your mouse, you can call up quizzes or worksheets that help you review your financial picture
or
create a budget, read up on ways to minimize your tax bill, ask how to set up a pension or IRA or
figure out how what type and much you should spend on insurance or save for retirement.<p>

These programs fall into two main categories: personal finance managers, such as the CD-ROM
version of Quicken Deluxe 4 for Windows or Managing Your Money; and dedicated
financial-advice
software, such as the Charles J. Givens Money Guide and Jonathan Pond's Personal Financial
Planner.
The other programs also feature financial heavy-hitters: Marshall Loeb, editor-at-large for
Fortune
magazine and author of the annual Marshall Loeb's Money Guide, co-hosts Quicken's financial
advice
section with Jane Bryant Quinn, columnist for Newsweek and author of Making the Most of Your
Money. And Managing Your Money has featured some input from Andrew Tobias, author of The
Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need. <p>

The strategies Givens and Pond outline in their respective books form the basis of some of the
advice
included in Money Guide and Personal Financial Planner. But the software format enables you to
locate the specific information you need much more quickly than you could using a book index.
And
the programs' worksheets do the math for you when, for example, you want to calculate the
long-term savings of refinancing your mortgage against the short-term closing costs. Givens' and
Pond's packages also feature customized financial advice. Quicken and Managing Your Money
have
a different advantage: After you get the information you need, you can often easily jump to
another
feature in the program and put what you've just learned into practice.<p>

All the experts except Tobias appear in video clips in the CD-ROM programs (Managing Your
Money comes only in a Windows floppy disk format; Money Guide and Personal Financial
Planner
are also available in Windows floppy disk versions without video.) In most of the clips, the
experts
appear simply as "talking heads," but Money Guide also includes more active segments--for
instance,
clips of a man writing out his financial wish list in a park.<p>

Don't expect the money mavens to wow you with a surefire way to rake in untold millions.
Rather,
they offer sensible advice about managing your money responsibly. They all teach their lessons
well,
and they effectively hammer home the most important point of all: The ultimate goal is to learn
enough to become your own financial expert.<p>

<p>

<b>MANAGING YOUR MONEY</b><p>

Andrew Tobias's commentary in Managing Your Money's text-only financial adviser is solid (and
free
if you're already using the software to balance your checkbook or track your savings). You reach
the
adviser from the program's main menu; the advice nicely balances general information about
finances
with tips on how to use Managing Your Money to apply Tobias's advice. Search for "about
escrows,"
for example, and you'll get both a summary of what escrows are and helpful hints on how you can
use
the program to set up a mortgage escrow account. Other tips, such as how to buy bonds, offer
specific information to help you decide if the strategy is right for you. <p>

Tobias sprinkles his advice with useful resources (including phone numbers) for more information
on
mutual funds, auto insurance, deep-discount stockbrokers and more. Managing Your Money's
financial adviser is somewhat more thorough than Quicken's Ask the Experts feature (see below),
and
it's as easily accessible, encouraging users to look for financial advice as they handle regular
money
management. <p>

<b>QUICKEN DELUXE 4 FOR WINDOWS CD-ROM</b><p>

The CD-ROM version of Quicken uses its Ask the Experts feature to deliver sound financial
advice
that's well integrated with the program's money management tools, such as Quicken's estimates of
the benefits of various home or auto loan options. Jane Bryant Quinn and Marshall Loeb dispense
advice in five categories: Financial Basics (saving, borrowing and so on), Long Term Goals
(financing
your retirement and the kids' college education), Home Ownership, Investments and Taxes. You
can
click on questions that highlight major financial concerns for each topic (such as "How do I
develop
a plan for savings?"), and the answers are concise and explicit. For example, Loeb offers an
excellent
90-second explanation of mutual funds. A narrator then directs you to Quicken's mutual-fund
register
to see how such funds are currently performing. While this quick question-and-answer format
makes
it easy to digest the program's advice, it precludes in-depth study of any single topic. And, despite
the tie-in to the main program, it doesn't use the data you've entered into your own Quicken
accounts
to make recommendations about how much money to put into mutual funds and how much to
keep
as cash. <p>

One of the best things about Ask the Experts is that Quinn and Loeb occasionally agree to
disagree.
There's no better way to realize the importance of financial self-reliance than to see that even the
mavens don't have magical access to all the right answers.<p>

<b>CHARLES J. GIVENS MONEY GUIDE</b><p>

You know you haven't done a perfect job managing your finances, but you're not exactly sure
how
to make it better. Charles J. Givens wants to help. He's going to tell you exactly how financial
plans
often go awry, warn you about some costly errors you could make in the future and explain ways
you
can avoid them. In the invaluable Ten Biggest Money Mistakes section, Givens comes on screen
to
tell you about common mistakes people make when buying a home, car or insurance, filling out a
W-4
form and more (the floppy disk version uses text instead of video clips). For example, Givens
details
the pitfalls of buying credit-life or disability insurance for a loan. The deals sound good--credit-life
pays the loan if you die, and disability insurance pays if you can't work. But there's a catch, and
it's
a big one--you'll overpay by up to 800 percent for the insurance you get when you could have
bought
annually renewable term life insurance for the same benefit. You can then call up a sobering
worksheet to calculate how much you're spending on credit-life and disability insurance each year.
<p>

After the shock wears off, you can hop into the Ask Charles Givens section by simply clicking on
a
button. Here, you can get quick answers to some common financial head-scratchers as well as
more
specialized questions. Parents whose children work as models, for example, may want to know if
their
child can file a tax return as the head of the household. If you're eager to expand your financial
knowledge, this section can help.<p>

The program's Wealth Management feature lets you jot down your financial dreams and goals,
learn
about record-keeping and analyze your fiscal picture. It's useful, but not as well integrated with
the
rest of the program as it could be. Nevertheless, even if you skip this part, your money has been
well
spent.<p>

<b>JONATHAN POND'S PERSONAL FINANCIAL PLANNER</b><p>

If you're seeking a detailed plan for managing your finances, Jonathan Pond's Personal Financial
Planner fits the bill. The software blends extensive financial information with quizzes, checklists,
worksheets, personalized strategies and action plans. In the CD-ROM, video clips highlight and
augment tips pulled from the accompanying text. The program is organized into chapters on
topics
such as taking stock of your financial situation,  reducing personal risk with insurance and
profiting
from wise investments. The answers you supply to the quiz questions deliver a customized
financial
strategy. The first quiz, for example, grills you about everything from your short- and long-term
financial goals to whether you'll need to collect Social Security benefits before age 65. Your score
determines the order in which Pond suggests you read the chapters; they might be shuffled so that
if, say, you indicate you're comfortable with tax regulations and tax-advantaged investing, you
won't
have to read the chapter on minimizing taxes until the very end of the session. <p>

The advice isn't always finely tuned to your particular situation--for example, Pond recommends
that
you pay off your monthly credit-card balance, whether it's $20 or $2,000. But in other cases, his
tips
are splendidly specific--he'll tell you, for instance, that your life or disability insurance coverage
doesn't really meet your needs, and he'll spell out the amount of additional insurance you need.
<p>

The program, which includes a financial glossary (see sidebar on page 200), ends with a Smart
Planner Report that summarizes your financial goals, why they're important and how to reach
them.
It's a good idea to print out the report and keep it on hand as you plan a financial strategy. In fact,
the best way to build a solid financial plan may be to choose more than one of these programs. At
the
very least, personal financial management software such as Quicken and Managing Your Money
can
help you track your spending and savings, even if the expert advice they offer isn't always specific
enough for your needs. In that case, it may be worthwhile to spend a few extra dollars to add a
dedicated financial adviser such as Money Guide or Personal Financial Planner to your software
collection. The detailed information in these packages can be a wise investment to help you and
your
family live comfortably now and in the coming years. Even more important, you can finally put an
end
to those nagging financial questions echoing in your head. <p>

<title>The Dig Reviewed</title>
</head>
<body><body background="peach.gif">
<h3>The Dig Should Have Stayed Buried</h3><br>
Tony Ardito
<hr>
The Dig, a new space adventure from Lucas Arts, that features an original story concept by
Steven
Spielberg, just doesn't hit the mark. I've liked some past Lucas Arts titles like Dark Forces, Sam
and Max
Hit the Road, Full Throttle, Rebel Assault, though none of them have really caught me up in a
"gotta
play them" frenzy. And following suit, The Dig just doesn't grab me and make me want to play it.
The game is too loosely connected with difficult puzzles, a badly laid out story line, and really bad
dialogue - but the graphics aren't too bad.<p>

The Dig begins with a large asteroid on a dangerous collision course with Earth (like some of
those
old 1950's SciFi movies). As Earth's only hope, a space-shuttle expedition is sent to knock the
asteroid out of its crush-the-Earth trajectory by placing small nuclear explosives on its surface. 
The
asteroid, however, is actually an alien spaceship that accidentally transports the shuttle crew (i.e.
you
the player) to a planet at the other end of the galaxy. Now you must find your way home. I
probably
should have just shut the game off right then and there and found my own way home, but no, I
decided to play on.<p>

This may be Lucas Arts but it sure isn't like any of their Star Wars games. The character
development
is weak and the graphics need improvement. The game depends on its puzzles to succeed. And
those
puzzles rely more on patience and persistence than cunning or creative thinking (I'm remembering
my dislike for those stupid puzzles in Myst). For example, it took me a long time to figure out
that
holding down the mouse button had a different effect in some areas than clicking and letting go.
Many
times, I found that I could solve the puzzles but was unable to interpret the ambiguous graphics
and
actually find needed items because they seem to meld with the scene's backgrounds.<p>

I will have to say that the video clips are pretty nice but the game lacks playability and it just isn't
fun
at all. Save your money here and avoid this one like the plauge. <p>

If you don't heed my warnings and do want to try it for yourself,  the game is available on CD for
Windows 3.x and Mac; distributed by LucasArts Entertainment; (800) 985-8227, (415) 472-3400;
<a href="http://www.lucasarts.com">http://www.lucasarts.com</a> (check out the web site for a
demo of the game and find out how lame
it
is for yourself).<p>

<h4><center>A look at what's happening in the computer industry and on the Internet.</h4>
</center>
<b>MAJOR TELECOM BILL PASSED BY CONGRESS:</b> Major telecommunications
legislation,
passed last week by both houses of Congress and certain to be signed by the President, is
expected
to transform the long-distance and local-service telephone carriers, the cable TV operators, and
the
electric utilities, all of which now will be able to compete against each other with relatively few
restrictions.  Expected to herald an age of innovative new products and services, the legislation
has
been hailed enthusiastically by almost every segment of the communications industry, though it is
being criticized by consumer groups, which predict rising prices for cable and phone services, and
by
civil liberties groups, which say the bill's penalties for using the Internet to distribute "indecent
material" to minors represent an abridgment of the constitutional right to free speech.  (New York
Times 2 Feb 96 p1)<p>

<b>SPINDLER REPLACED BY AMELIO AT APPLE:</b> Yielding to pressure from investors
angry
about the company's battered state, Apple's board of directors has ousted Michael Spindler and
replaced him with Gilbert F. Amelio as chief executive officer.  To take the position, Amelio
resigned
as president and CEO of National Semiconductor. a company that he has been credited with
"turning
around."  (Wall Street Journal 2 Feb 96 A3)<p>

<b>ANOTHER GLOBAL TELECOM ALLIANCE:</b> Telecommunications companies
Deutsche
Telekom, FranceTelecom and Sprint are forming an alliance called Global One in order to provide
worldwide voice, data and video services for corporate clients;  international consumer services
(such
as calling cards); and international transmission and support to other international carriers.  Global
One will be competing against two previously formed global alliances:  Uniworld, formed by
AT&amp;T
and four European telecom operators;  and Concert, formed by British Telecommunications and
Sprint.  (Financial Times 1 Feb 96 p16)<p>

<b>AMERICA ONLINE ADDED TO GERMAN INTERNET INVESTIGATION:</b> America
Online
says that AOL Europe, which it runs jointly with Bertelsmann AG, has become part of a probe by
some German prosecutors of anti-Semitic and neo-Nazi mail on the Internet.  CompuServe and a
European online service already have been questioned by the investigators.  (Atlanta
Journal-Constitution 3 Feb 96 D3)<p>

<b>JAPANESE COMPANIES PREPARE ASSAULT ON U.S. PC MARKET: </b>Toshiba is
moving
beyond the laptop into the U.S. desktop market, with a new line of home PC models scheduled
for
the fourth quarter of 1996, in time for Christmas sales.  Sony and Hitachi both have declared their
intentions to market to U.S. consumers, and Fujitsu is expected to make a similar announcement. 
Toshiba currently holds a 20% market share in the U.S. notebook market, and the company's PC
division general manager says he wants Toshiba to be the world's fifth-largest PC maker by 1998,
and
the third largest by 2000, up from No. 9 today.  (Wall Street Journal 2 Feb 96 B4)<p>

<b>DEAD INFORMATION ON THE WEB: </b>Futurist Paul Saffo predicts the transformation
of the
Web in the next 12 months:  "The Web as we know it today is dead.  It's dead in two ways:
because
it's going to mutate into something else very quickly and be unrecognizable within 12 months, and
secondly, it's dead because all it's got on it is dead information.  Sure, there are links, but the links
just
lead to more dead information.  It's a big information mausoleum.  But with things like Java, you
get
animation.  The information is alive...  Today, if you think about it, it's really quite bizarre.  You
dial
into a Web page. There may be a thousand other people at that page.  But the only way that you
even
know anyone else is there is that the server is slow.  The next big change is going to be finding
ways
to put qualities that we associate with MUDs today into Web pages so that you can interact with
people."  (Upside Feb 96 p26)<p>

<b>"EVERYONE REMAIN CALM": </b>The Denver-Rocky Mountain News reports that
management
at the new $5-billion Denver airport forgot to install an intercom system for the subways that
trundle
passengers from concourse to concourse, so when the computer controlling the subways broke
down,
there was no way to communicate with the trapped passengers.  The city has now rectified the
situation by purchasing six electronic bullhorns.  (Telecommunications Policy Report 28 Jan 96
p10)<p>

<b>BYE BYE BLACKBIRD: </b>Microsoft Corp. will halt work on its Blackbird software,
which would
have enabled independent companies to create proprietary information content for the Microsoft
Network.  Microsoft's online service strategy has increasingly shifted toward the Web, and away
from
the idea of proprietary content.  The company now plans a new version of Blackbird called
Internet
Studio, which will be compatible with standard Web format.  Some MSN content providers
weren't
too happy with the announcement:  "It's catastrophic," says one. "It's one thing to migrate the
technology and it's another to abandon it." (Wall Street Journal 5 Feb 96 B3)<p>

<b>DIGITAL'S STRONGARM CHIP:</b> Digital Equipment Corp. has unveiled its
StrongARM
microprocessing chip, which it hopes will serve as the foundation for low-cost Internet terminals,
interactive video games, cellular phones and hand-held computers.   Oracle Corp., which currently
is developing an inexpensive Internet appliance, is exploring the option of using Digital's chip in
its
device.  "StrongARM represents the kind of technology that will put a web appliance within the
reach
of the mass-consumer market," says Oracle's VP of network computing. The new chip is priced at
$29 and runs on AA batteries.  (Wall Street Journal 5 Feb 96 B3)<p>

<b>PRODIGY LOWBALLS THE INTERNET</b>: Prodigy Services is launching a new
marketing
experiment, offering Internet service at a measly $1 an hour to new subscribers in the
metropolitan
New York area.  The company hopes to expand the offer nationally later this spring, and also
plans
to start a partnership program that would allow other companies to use the Prodigy network to
brand
their own Internet access services.  "We want to line up a lot of companies to third-party market
this
for us," says a Prodigy VP.  (Wall Street Journal 5 Feb 96 B3)<p>

<b>SPEEDIER GRAPHICS ON COMMERCIAL SERVICES:</b> Tired of watching the
hourglass,
waiting for those fancy graphics to download?  America Online, CompuServe and Prodigy all plan
to do something about it.  Prodigy's Web browser allows users to interact immediately with text
material while graphics download in the background, and AOL has announced a similar product
for
release sometime this year.  The upgrade will not affect Internet use, however. CompuServe's
approach involves fewer graphics in the first place:  "Is it more important that operations take half
as long or have twice as many pretty pictures?" asks a CompuServe spokesman.  "What we hear
is
that people don't want to wait."  (St. Petersburg Times 5 Feb 96 p15)<p>

<b>ANOTHER GLOBAL TELECOM ALLIANCE: </b>Telecommunications companies
Deutsche
Telekom, France Telecom, and Sprint are forming an alliance called Global One in order to
provide
worldwide voice, data and video services for corporate clients;  international consumer services
(such
as calling cards);  and international transmission and support to other international carriers. 
Global
One will be competing against two previously formed global alliances:  Uniworld, formed by
AT&amp;T
and four European telecom operators;  and Concert, formed by British Telecommunications and
MCI. 
(Financial Times 1 Feb 96 p16)<p>

<b>APPLE PRICE CUTS AND REBATES: </b>Apple is cutting the prices of its
consumer-oriented
Macintosh Performa computers by as much as 12% and is extending a rebate program on printers
and
monitors.  The company also announced it is developing a version of the Linux operating system
which will run along with the Macintosh operating system on a single machine.  &lt; <a
href="http://www.mklinux.apple.com">http://www.
mklinux.apple.com</a> &gt;  (New York Times 6 Feb 96 C6)<p>

<b>DEBATE OVER FREE SPEECH ON THE INTERNET: </b>Is the Internet like TV and
radio -- or
like newspaper and bookstores?  Supporters of the anti-"indecency" provision of the major new
tele-communications legislation think it's more like the broadcast media -- whereas the American
Civil
Liberties Union and other civil-liberties groups think it's more like print media, and that efforts to
restrict free expression on it should be kept to an absolute minimum.  At issue the telecom bill's
provision that would make it a crime to transmit (or allow to be transmitted) "indecent" material
over
a computer network to which minors have access.   Indecency is defined in the bill as "any
comment,
request, suggestion, proposal, image or other communication that, in context, depicts or
describes,
in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or
excretory
activities or organs."  (New York Times 8 Feb 96 A10)  In Canada, a committee from the
Information Highway Advisory Council is reviewing existing Canadian laws, but there are no
plans
to follow Washington's example by trying to bring about legislation to regulate adult materials on
the
Internet. (Toronto Star 7 Feb 96 A10)<p>

<b>ONLINE BILL-PAYING STILL HAS A WAY TO GO:</b> While banks are touting the
ease of
online bill-paying, the reality is that unless a merchant has installed the equipment necessary for
true
electronic payments, the online bill-payment companies often end up sending paper checks
through
overnight mail.  "People expect it to be faster and more accurate, but it's put together with
chewing
gum and baling wire behind the scenes," says the editor of Online Banking Report.  The problem
is
classic chicken-and-egg -- merchants don't want to bother with online systems until more
customers
use them, and customers won't use them until more merchants are online.  (Wall Street Journal 7
Feb
96 B1)<p>

<b>CAR LOANS IN CYBERSPACE:</b> IBM and Chase Manhattan Bank are developing a
system for
processing car loans over the Internet, and hope to install the system at 200 dealerships by the end
of the year.  Reynolds &amp; Reynolds, a software company, is developing a similar system. 
Loan
processing and approval under such systems will take only ten minutes for an applicant with a
strong
credit history.   (New York Times 8 Feb 96 C4)<p>

<b>PACKARD BELL GETS CASH, ZENITH DATA</b>:  Packard Bell has arranged a
complicated deal
with France's Cie. des Machines Bull and Japan's NEC Corp., which will result in a $650 million
cash
infusion and Packard Bell ownership of Zenith Data Systems.  "This gives Packard Bell breathing
room that they desperately need and it was one of the very few scenarios where Packard Bell
could
get themselves out of a corner and still retain control of the business," says an analyst for
Dataquest.
The move would give Packard Bell instant access to Zenith Data's big corporate and government
accounts, and could propel it past No. 1 Compaq Computer to become the largest PC vendor in
the
U.S.  (Wall Street Journal 7 Feb 96 A3)<p>

<b>INTERNET USAGE POLICIES: </b> Neal J. Friedman, a specialist in online computer law,
says that
"employees are under the misapprehension that the First Amendment applies in the workplace --

<b>APPLE TURNOVER:</b> A new calm appears to have cover over Apple headquarters, in
spite of the
fact that its operating loss in the second fiscal quarter will surpass its first quarter deficit.  The
company say it has discontinued all merger talks with other companies (including Sun), and now
plans
to go it alone, under the new leadership of Gil Amelio, the new chairman and CEO who replaced
ousted Michael Spindler.  Amelio has been credited with turning around National Semiconductor,
which he left in order to take his current position with Apple.  Apple's announcement departs
from
its usual practice of refusing comment on merger talks, and was made because it thinks rumors
and
speculation have been hurting sales.  Vice Chairman A.C. "Mike" Markkula says:  "I have
completely
lost faith in the press to report anything even near the truth."  (Wall Street Journal 9 Feb 96

<b>PHONE COMPANIES GET READY TO COMPETE:</b> With the new
telecommunications
legislation now passed and signed, the providers of long-distance and local phone services are
rapidly
moving ahead with plans to compete against each other in offering a full range of communications
services.  AT&amp;T CEO Robert Allen says his company will offer local, long-distance and TV
services,
and will be leasing local telephone capacity from the Bells and other local service providers, as
well
as developing local (and possibly wireless) communication networks of its own. Two regional
service
providers, Bell Atlantic (in the mid-Atlantic states) and NYNEX (in New England and New
York),
may counter AT&amp;T's moves by merging or forming some sort of alliance.  Bell Atlantic's
president
says: "We've got to figure out how we can offer long-distance and local service in competition
with
the likes of AT&amp;T.  In between where we are today and something that falls short of a full
merger,
there are things that make sense."  (New York Times 9 Feb 96 A1)<p>

<b>OPEN UNIVERSITY ON THE INTERNET:</b> The British Open University, whose
pioneering work
in distance learning has served as a model for institutions around the globe, now is making some
of
it courses available over the Internet to English-speaking students internationally.  &lt;<a

<b>NETSCAPE, SILICON GRAPHICS TEAM UP FOR 3-D</b>: Netscape Communications
and Silicon
Graphics have endorsed the Moving Worlds standard for 3-D images on the Web, using Sun
Microsystems' Java networking language to animate objects.  The move is significant in its
opposition
to Microsoft's proposed Active VRML language, which would work with Java, but not with most
other existing software.  Netscape reports it has more than 50 companies signed on to support
Moving Worlds, and Microsoft plans to publish a list of its endorsers next month.  (Wall Street
Journal 13 Feb 96 pB5)<p>

<b>COMPUSERVE LAUNCHES INTERNET-ONLY SERVICE:</b> CompuServe has started
a new
Internet-only service called Sprynet, offering unlimited access for a flat fee of $19.95 a month.  At
the same time, the company announced it initially would block Sprynet customers from access to
more than 200 online forums where sex-related issues are discussed, becoming the first big
Internet
service provider to restrict that kind of information.  Meanwhile, AOL's chairman announced
America
Online's Internet-only GNN business has attracted more than 100,000 customers in the past 90
days.

<b>VIRTUAL UNIVERSITY SLATED FOR 1997:</b> The Western Governors' Association,
led by Gov.
Roy Rohmer of Colorado and Gov. Mike Leavitt of Utah, are rapidly pulling together plans for a
western virtual university and now say they expect to begin admitting students by the summer of
1997.  The Education Management Group, a subsidiary of Simon &amp; Schuster, has donated
$150,000
to the planning effort.  (Chronicle of Higher Education 16 Feb 96 A21)<p>

<b>NEW PROCESS YIELDS STURDIER, FASTER CHIPS</b>: Engineers at the University of
Illinois
have discovered that a simple substitution in the computer chip manufacturing process could
increase
chips' lifespan by 10 to 50 times, or alternatively, allow them to operate at faster speeds.  By
treating
a chip with deuterium instead of hydrogen in the final stage of the manufacturing process, the
resulting product is better able to weather the battering it takes from the electrons that store and
transmit messages.  "The tantalizing thing will be to use the trade-off between lifespan and
performance to make the chip work even faster," says one researcher, who estimates the
substitution
process would add only about $1.50 to the cost of a wafer of chips. (Investor's Business Daily 15

<b>A NEW ENTREPRENEUR'S RESOURCE ON THE NET: </b>The U.S. Business Advisor
offers
small businesses online access to guides and government forms needed to comply with regulations
or apply for government-backed loans or other federal assistance.  The new service, unveiled
Tuesday
by Vice President Gore, supplies "one-stop access to federal agencies that regulate and assist
business," says Gore.  It's expected to be the first in a family of electronic products aimed at
"customer groups" such as veterans, travelers, the research community, and state and local
governments.&lt;<a href="http://www.business.gov">http://www.business.gov</a> &gt;(Wall

<b>ONLINE SERVICES TO PEAK IN TWO YEARS?</b>: A new study by Forrester Research
predicts
that the popularity of commercial online services such as America Online and CompuServe will
peak
by 1998, with a total of 16 million subscribers.  That number will drop to about 15 million the
following year, and will continue to fall as more businesses migrate to the Internet.  Companies
that
pursue the strategy of offering Internet services directly, such as AT&amp;T, MCI and Microsoft,
will
likely reap the benefits.  (Investor's Business Daily 20 Feb 96 A13)<p>

<b>COMPAQ AND PACKARD BELL SETTLE LAWSUIT:</b> Compaq and Packard Bell
have settled
the legal actions begun after Compaq accused Packard Bell of obtaining a competitive advantage
by
including used parts in computers sold as new.  One of the attorneys said the lawsuit was dropped
because of the likelihood that state and federal regulators would soon force computer companies
to
disclose when a new machine includes recycled parts.  (Houston Chronicle 24 Feb 96 1C)<b><p>

H&amp;R BLOCK AND SEARS END THEIR INTERNET LOVE AFFAIRS</b>: H&amp;R
Block, the
tax-preparation company, is spinning off its online subsidiary, CompuServe as a new public
company,
saying:  "The separation of CompuServe will unlock the value we have created through both of
these
strong franchises and will better position each entity to growth opportunities in their respective
markets."  (New York Times 21 Feb 96) ...Meanwhile, Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. will sell its
50% stake
in Prodigy, which it owns in partnership with IBM.  "We have concluded that this investment does
not represent an asset that should be part of our portfolio over the long term," says Sears' CEO. 
IBM
is considering whether to buy Sears' 50% or divest its own share of the venture.  (Wall Street

for its new
Web site, located at &lt;<a href="http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/

<b>AT&amp;T TO OFFER INTERNET ACCESS: AT&amp;T</b> Corporation will offer
dial-up access to the
Internet through its Worldnet service.  Pricing will "be aggressive enough to make the industry sit
up
and take notice," says an AT&amp;T spokesman.  An update on New York Times Online says
AT&amp;T will
give free subscriptions to its existing customers if they use the network for less than five hours a
month, or charge existing customers $19.95 a month for unlimited Internet access. (New York

<b>$500 BOX DOESN'T WORRY ANDY GROVE: </b>When asked about the impact that the
$500
Internet PC might have on Intel's PC business, CEO Andy Grove says :  "Remember, the PC is
not
a thing.  It's an organic phenomenon -- like a river, it flows.  It constantly adapts to underlying
technology changes, user demands, even market surprises.  For instance, desktop conferencing
was
not anticipated.  The profound and pervasive use of messaging mail wasn't anticipated. 
Commercial
online services were not anticipated.  And now the Web.  The PC has perfectly adapted to all of
these. 
Now compare that to the $500 box, which is a restricted viewing device that is going to have a
restricted use...  I don't think it will ever hit the tens-of-millions-of-units-a-year volume.  And if
I'm
wrong, and they do, it will take several years for that to happen.  Just think how great the PC will
be
in several years."  (Forbes ASAP 26 Feb 96 p63)<p>

<b>AT&amp;T INTERNET SERVICE IS NOT-READY-FOR- PRIMETIME: </b>After
announcing with
great fanfare its intention to offer Internet service to the masses, AT&amp;T now is saying its
technical
system still needs some work.  The long-distance giant still needs local computer nodes to collect
data
traffic and is lacking Internet software for Mac and Windows 95 operating systems.  The service
now
probably won't be available until mid-April or May, putting AT&amp;T at a disadvantage with
regard to
competitors MCI and Sprint, which are proceeding with their own Internet marketing plans.  Even
when it gets its technical systems operation, AT&amp;T will still have a long way to go in
developing
expertise in technical customer support, says an industry editor, who notes it's a lot harder to
answer
a computer inquiry than it is to service a phone bill complaint.  (Wall Street Journal 1 Mar 96
B2)<p>

<b>PC PRICE WAR, CONTINUED: </b>Compaq Computer announced it will slash prices on
selected PC
models and boost promotions in yet another round of the PC price wars.  The strategy will hurt
Compaq's short-term performance, but it's taking satisfaction in the knowledge that its
competitors
will bleed with it.  "This provides us with the opportunity to be the leader in setting price and
setting
position," says Compaq's CFO.  "To the extent that hurts our competition, well that's what it's
designed to do."  "It's really a mutual suffering...The end result is you have fewer credible
companies
left in the business by the end of the year," says an industry analyst.  (St. Petersburg Times 2 Mar

<b>INTEL WORKS ON PENTIUM PRO PROBLEM</b>: Intel Corp. says it will work with
computer
manufacturers to correct a problem in the Pentium Pro chip set that causes some Pentium
Pro-equipped computers to operate much slower than they should.  The company says it doesn't
know how many computers are affected, but estimates it's a very small number.  "We're working
with
computer makers to be sure any user who has a concern about this situation gets their problem
resolved," says a company spokesman.  (Investor's Business Daily 1 Mar 96 A4)<p>

<b>CHIP THIEVES ARRESTED IN CALIFORNIA POLICE STING</b>: More than 45 arrests
were
made in Silicon Valley this week as the result of a sting operation to catch thieves who, according
to the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Jose, have been plaguing high-tech companies with "very
sophisticated, armed takeover robberies where people go in with handguns, long guns, and
semi-automatic weapons in a sort of paramilitary style, armed with duct tape and Flexicuffs, and
in
a very short time steal chips."  (New York Times 1 Mar 96 A8)<p>

<b>APPLE PULLS THE PLUG ON eWORLD:</b> Apple Computer has announced that its
eWorld
online service will "cease operations" March 31.  The move is CEO Gilbert Amelio's first
high-visibility step toward restructuring Apple operations since he took over last month.  Officials
close to Apple say the computer maker now is contemplating offering a portfolio of different Web
sites and services narrowly targeted at specific industries, such as education, where Apple is still
strong.  (Wall Street Journal 4 Mar 96 B3)<p>

<b>NETSCAPE TRIMS PRICES IN COMPETITION WITH MICROSOFT</b>: Netscape
Communications has slashed the price of its low-end Internet server software by 40%, and made
drastic cuts in prices of other versions in an effort to combat Microsoft's recent giveaway of a
rival
program as part of its Windows NT operating system.  Netscapes FastTrack Server, targeted at
small
businesses and nontechnical users, now costs $295, down from $495. (Wall Street Journal 5 Mar

<b>PCWORLD LIKES MAC/OS: </b>Though PCWorld magazine's main focus is on
IBM-compatible

<b></i>NEW NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR BUGS DISCOVERED:</b> Two researchers at the
Open Software
Foundation have discovered a couple of flaws in Netscape's latest version of its popular Navigator
Web-browsing software, and have received $1,000 each from Netscape for their trouble. One flaw
takes advantage of various loopholes in Netscape's JavaScript control language, that could allow
a
Web site to peruse the hard disk drive of a user browsing the site.  Operators of the Web site
could
discover the names of files, but not read the contents.  The other bug allows a Web site to force a
user's machine to send an e-mail message to another computer, violating the privacy of users who
wish to keep their e-mail addresses to themselves.  Netscape will issue a new version, Navigator
2.01,
next week. (San Jose Mercury News 5 Mar 96)<p>

<b>PUBLIC INTERNET KIOSK</b>: Can't stay off the Net?  San Diego-based Atcom Inc. has

components,
along with Seagate technology.  (New York Times 7 Mar 96 D8)<p>

<b>3-M FLOPPY IS A HOG FOR DATA</b>: 3-M's LS-120 floppy computer disk, with more
than 80
times the storage capacity of conventional floppies, will hit the shelves April 2.  The company
hopes
its new disk and drive, developed in cooperation with Compaq Computer, Matsushita-Kotobuki
Electronics Industries and O.R. Technology,  will become the new industry standard.  Key to that
strategy is the ability of the LS-120 drive to read conventional 1.44 megabyte diskettes.
"Backward
compatibility is a major advantage of LS-120 technology," says the head of an industry analysis
firm. 
The new disks have a suggested retail price of $19.99, and the drives will be available as an option
on Compaq computers for an additional $210.  (Investor's Business Daily 5 Mar 96 A9)<p>

Tidy Webs </h2>
<h3>Tiff Bailey</h3>
<hr>
You and your Mac have been surfing the web for a few months. At every session you add a few
bookmarks to your web browser's field. Now its time for some more serious work and you want
to return to some previous sites. You open the bookmark menu and see a mess of names, all in
the order of the date that you last visited them. The oldest at the top and most recent ones at the
bottom. At least the scroll bar keeps the list on the screen. If you're having problems keeping
everything arranged, then you may be in need of some kind of web page organizing tool. <p>

CE Software has developed just such a tool, called WebArranger, which allows you to capture,
organize and control your web world. WebArranger is available for review at CE Software's web
site,<a href=" http://www.cesoft.com/"> http://www.cesoft.com/</a>. The latest version is rev
2.0 and lists for $79.95. There is a 30 day
demo version which takes about 1.5 hours to download at 14.4 K baud. <p>

The minimum system requirements are: 4 megs of hard disk space, 12 megs of RAM, system 7.1
or above, and a TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol) connection to the
Internet. It is also coded to operate in an accelerated mode on a Power PC. <p>

The latest version comes with WebWacker, which is a utility that will download a complete web
site file for later viewing off line.<p>

The object-oriented database engine at its core gives you an incredible range of customization,
functionality, and performance. <p>

From WebArranger you can bring in the bookmark file from the web browser, sort the topics,
make comments a site and then export the bookmark file back to the web browser.  <p>

Did you ever visit a site and forget to tag a bookmark? WebArranger will even display the history
of all your web sessions, each and every page.<p>

WebArranger allows you to integrate all your web applications; e-mail, file transfer agent, news
reader, into one location. Start WebArranger first then call up other tools as needed from one
screen. No need to return to finder or the Apple menu to start other applications.<p>

One of the neatest features is the Grabber(TM). Let's say you are off-line and reading an
attachment to an e-mail letter which lists a bunch of URLs (uniform resource locators or web
sites). The Grabber allows you to highlight the name of the URL with a few key strokes (mine is
set at Command-Option-C). Unlike cut/paste you can continue to collect URL's or e-mail
addresses. The next time WebArranger is started this "Grabbed" information will be loaded into a
topic for use at the next online session, even if the Mac is shut down for a time.<p>

There are other features as well, setable reminders to re-visit web sites, and in-depth search
functions. To help learn the application, sample folders and topics are included. The manual is
designed to be updated by visiting CE Software's home page. This new revision comes with a
Web Validator Agent that will notify you if a URL is no longer active. For your other life,
WebArranger ships with an Organizer Folder already set up to manage your personal
appointments and To Do lists. Want to tidy up everything, get WebArranger from CE Software,
800-523-7638.<p>

<h2>Some Popular Windows, Mac, and Dos Word
Processing Programs Reviewed</h2>
<hr>
<p>

<p>

Besides the operating system that runs your computer, you probably use your word processing
program more than any other program on your hard drive. You use it to write letters, memos,
business proposals, reports, grocery lists and even on occasion to layout a magazine. That good
old
word processor program is in use every day, if not every hour. Today's word processing programs
offer a wealth of features never imagined when WordPerfect first hit the market some 17 years
ago.
Today's programs come with spell checkers, grammar correctors, wizards that lead you through
every step of the way in creating that perfect proposal or document and powerful desktop
publishing
and drawing features.<p>

Our review takes a look at the current Windows, Mac, and DOS offerings from Novell-
WordPerfect,
Lotus, Microsoft,  WorldSoft, DeScribe and The Technology Group. All of the programs
reviewed
are capable, powerful packages and there is little difference between the basic features they all
offer.
There are however, certain differences in how one program handles a feature from another and it
is
on these details that you need to base your decision on which program to purchase. <p>

You need to decide which features beyond the basics are important to you and your business? Are
you looking for a program with extensive desktop publishing or world wide web features or just
one
that will let you produce simple brochures through use of a template? Do you need a program that
will correct your spelling while you type, or one that has coaches and Wizards that will help you
along the way? Some of the programs we reviewed have all of these enhancements, but choosing
one
for you now revolves around what you have to spend. The fancier you go, the more the program
will
eat up your software budget. <p>

The next thing to consider is which operating system are you using and what's available for it.  All
of the Windows-based word processor programs from Microsoft, Lotus, and Novell-
WordPerfect
require at least 8MB of RAM to launch and operate but really need 16MB for a crash-free
operating
speed. <p>

The Windows applications all take up large amounts of your hard-drive space as well. A typical
WordPerfect for Windows installation requires 32MB;  as does a full installation of Word; and a
Lotus Word Pro installation uses a whopping 41MB. So, before you decide to upgrade to one of
these programs make sure your computer has both the hard drive space and the RAM needed to
operate them.<p>

As Windows (both 3x and 95) has emerged as the unopposed leader of word processing
platforms,
this platform has the widest selection of programs available. Microsoft Word for Windows, Lotus
Word Pro, and DeScribe are 32-bit applications. This means that these word processors were
specifically designed to take advantage of Windows 95 and it's 32-bit technology. WordPerfect
and
XyWrite remain 16-bit applications that run under both Windows 3.1 and Windows 95. <p>

<p>

If you're a Mac user the pickings are mighty slim for a new/upgraded word processing program.
Only
Word, WordPerfect and WorldWrite have issued anything in the way of upgrades in recent times.
The
other main contenders, Claris MacWrite Pro and SoftKey WriteNow, remain at versions 1.5 and
4.0,
respectively. One interesting piece of information to potential Claris purchasers: Claris recently
reduced the price of MacWrite Pro from $249 to $49, so this might be the bargain you've been
looking for.<p>

We will begin the reviews by looking at word processing programs designed for Windows,
followed
by Mac programs and last but not least, one Dos (yep, I said Dos) program.<b><p>

<u><p>

WINDOWS PROGRAMS: </u><p>

WordPerfect 6.1 for Windows</b><p>

Having started it's life as a DOS program almost two decades ago, WordPerfect for Windows still
is hard to beat. Version 6.1 is now over a year old, and while it might be a bit outdated compared
with the newest versions of Word and Word Pro, it still remains an excellent program (I am using
it
to put this article together). If you're not planning on making the transition to Windows 95, then
WordPerfect 6.1 is the word processor to choose. Novell had announced that they were ready to
put
out WordPerfect 7 for Windows 95, which would support long file names, tabbed dialog boxes,
Internet publishing (6.1 also supports Internet Publishing with an add-on feature), and so on.
However, with Novell's sale of  WordPerfect to Corel, the newest version is on hold. Corel has
announced that they will put out a new version, called CorelPerfect, but no date for availability
has
been set.  <p>

Despite Novell's sale of the division, WordPerfect's file management system still ranks among the
best
of the programs reviewed. In addition to copying, renaming, and deleting a file within
WordPerfect,
you can open a copy of a file and leave the original alone. QuickFinder is a speedy search tool that
combs your files for words or phrases, then indexes its findings. QuickList lets you build a list of
documents you frequently use, and the View option lets you preview a document before opening
it.
A powerful "coach" feature takes you step by step through almost any of the features or functions
of the program<p>

Like other word processors, WordPerfect lets you customize the interface and display to your
liking.
You can label toolbar buttons with text instead of graphics. You can also add buttons to launch
macros or run other Windows applications. The toolbar changes as you run macros or launch
other
operations within the program. As an example when using the add-on Internet Publisher, the
toolbar
displays such things as options to create links, add graphics, change text into html etc.<p>

The software offers strong desktop publishing capabilities. TextArt creates a multitude of curved,
spiraled and slanted text effects for headlines and layouts. Another module automatically adds
drop
caps. WordPerfect's automation also extends to editing and formatting. Grammatik 6,
WordPerfect's
grammar-checker, not only spots bad grammar but offers to correct it. This function is can be a
little
tedious, but it well worth the effort as it makes many useful suggestions on how to punch up your
text. Document Experts(templates and such), similar to those found in Word's Wizards, generate
memos, newsletters, fax sheets, and similar documents. WordPerfect ships with more than 50
templates for such documents, including brochures, newsletters, resumes, business cards and press
releases.<p>

Online help is alive and well here, meaning fewer trips to the instruction manual (I've opened it
about
3 times in over a year of using the program). WordPerfect's Coaches walk you through such tasks
as creating headers and importing graphics, and Upgrade Expert helps you make the transition
from
other word processors.<p>

As mentioned above, WordPerfect 6.1 has a free add-on feature called Internet Publisher. Once
installed, the program runs as a template allowing you to bring in text and graphics and with the
click
of a button turn it into an html document. It works pretty well, though it seems to add a lot of
extra
&lt;p&gt; paragraph tags and a few other crazy tags here and there among the file. Of course,
even though
it makes an html document, you still need to do all of the other steps necessary to get it on the
web -
so please don't think, wam, bam thank you mam, you'll have a site on the web; It's not that easy.
<p>

It's hard to believe that WordPerfect has been around for nearly 17 years, but WordPerfect 6.1 for
Windows clearly shows the advantages of experience. Feature rich, powerful, and very easy to
use,
WordPerfect for Windows approaches perfection. Let's only hope that Corel can keep the product
perfect. Judging from their previous successful experience with redesigning products purchased
from
another company (Ventura Desktop Publishing), I think they will do a fine job on WordPerfect.
<p>

<b>Word for Windows 95</b><p>

Word for Windows has improved over the years like a fine wine. Microsoft has taken Word for
Windows 6.0 and enhanced and fine-tuning many of its existing features. Sure, there's some new
stuff
added to the program, but mainly it's a prettier version of Word for Windows 6.0 .<p>

Word is one of the easiest program to learn and use, thanks to loads of automated features and
exceptional online help. It also has a really great looking interface. The new Answer Wizard is a
prime
example of the great online help: Type a question in plain English, and Word produces an answer.
Thus typing, "How do I insert a graphic into my document?" reveals not only a set of instructions
but
also numerous related topics. Similarly, Word's new Tip Wizard follows your actions within the
program and suggests better ways to accomplish tasks.<p>

Word 95 adds more IntelliSense features while improving existing ones. AutoCorrect now catches
and corrects a greater variety of typos and can convert certain characters into symbols. Word's
nifty
on-the-fly spell-checker works as you type, drawing a wavy red line under words the
spell-checker
doesn't recognize. Right-click on the offending word and a pop-up menu appears with a selection
of
correctly spelled alternatives. <p>

Because Word doesn't use frames for text and graphics, it's not ideally suited to desktop
publishing
tasks, although it does offer a robust array of drawing, charting, column, and table-generation
tools.
You can download Internet Assistant, a free utility, from Microsoft's World Wide Web site
(<a href="http://www.microsoft.com">http://www.microsoft.com</a>) and use it to turn Word
into a Web browser and HTML editor for
creating Web pages. This program doesn't work as well as the one for WordPerfect, however it
does
do a fair job and with some work you can make a decent html document.<p>

Word's clunky File Find utility has merged with the File Open box, making for a better file
management system. Files created with Word 95 are compatible with Word 6.0, and vice versa.
And
a great selection of Wizards and templates are easily accessible via tabbed dialog boxes, round out
this excellent word processing package. <b><p>

DeScribe 5</b><p>

DeScribe Inc.'s word processor is this article's bargain product, even with it's less than perfect
interface. With a list price of $49, DeScribe ships with a 500-page manual and a CD that contains
DeScribe for Windows 3.1 and the 32-bit versions for Windows 95, Windows NT, and OS/2
Warp.
Regardless of your operating system, your documents are compatible with any version of
DeScribe.
The prograsm comes with a great number of features and tools. However the interface is
somewhat
clumsy to use. If an application's interface is important to you, consider another word processor
for
your purchase.<p>

By employing frames to contain and arrange all text, graphics, and tables, DeScribe does
double-duty
as a desktop publisher. Learning to manage these frames takes time. DeScribe's  Frame Manager
makes easy work of modifying frame attributes, such as altering a frame's margins, borders,
shading,
and even print/nonprint status. Furthermore, DeScribe's excellent unlimited-undo feature makes it
easy to recover from word processing blunders. A pop-up slider bar displays what your document
looked like in previous states, allowing you to see the results of the undo before you actually
choose
it.<p>

DeScribe's crudely illustrated toolbars are loosely grouped by function, such as editing and layout,
but only one can appear onscreen at a time. Toolbars that are too long to fit onscreen don't wrap
around to a second line; rather, they stay partially hidden, requiring you to scroll to reveal what's
offscreen. To reveal a button's function, you must click on it with the right-button. <p>

DeScribe allows you to customize its toolbars, but the process isn't nearly as easy as in, say, Word
Pro. If  you have a tight budget but have plenty of time to deal with an awkward interface and a
thick
manual, DeScribe could certainly fit your bill.  <p>

<b>Word Pro 96 for Windows 95</b><p>

Lotus AmiPro users have been waiting three years for a major upgrade to the very good but
limited
Windows word processor. With Word Pro the wait is over. The program has a new name, a new
look, and a number of new features;  in other words, Word Pro 96 has arrived and it's gunning for
Microsoft Word. Word Pro's attractive interface supports virtually unlimited customization. Every
Word Pro feature can become a button on a toolbar, and every toolbar can take up residence
anywhere on the screen. <p>

The program resembles Microsoft Word, but Word Pro outshines its chief competitor in many
areas.
For desktop publishing tasks, Word Pro has features similar to Word's charting, drawing,
equation,
and table tools and excels with its frame-based layout abilities. Both programs offer on-the-fly
spell-checking and automatic error-correction, but only Word Pro's spell-checker  situates itself at
the top of the screen without blocking the text as it operates. Finally, Word can't match Word
Pro's
slick Special Views, which displays outline, thumbnail, and other views of a document onscreen at
the same time. A SmartMasters function  allows a user to fill in preformated templates to add a
professional appearance to memos, newletters, labels and correspondance.<p>

Two notable features truly standout in Word Pro. The first is its built-in Internet support. (Both
Word
and WordPerfect require you to download the add-on utility.) In addition to importing World
Wide
Web files (html documents), you can design and export Web pages complete with tables and
graphics.
The second major item is Team Computing, which refers to Word Pro's group editing features.
These
allow multiple users to work on the same document, revising it and collaborating toward a
finished
product. To accomplish this, Word Pro incorporates document versioning, which stores multiple
versions of a document with all edited versions stored in a single file to save hard drive space.
When
all editing is complete, Word Pro quickly consolidates the various revisions into a final document.
If
your business depends on group editing, Word Pro is the choice for you.<p>

Word Pro's online help resembles Word's Answer Wizard. Using Ask the Expert, you type in
plain-English questions and Assistants walk you through various tasks. Despite all this, the
program
takes some time to master. Also, be prepared to sacrifice 41MB of your hard drive for a typical
full
installation.  <p>

Despite a few oversights, Word Pro is, in our opinion, a better buy for use with Windows 95 than
Microsoft Word thanks to its redesign, intuitive features, and excellent word processing
functionality.
In other words, Mr. Gates needs to send his people back to the drawing board for yet another
update
on Word for Windows to be able to adequately compete with Word Pro 96.<p>

<b>XyWrite 4.12 for Windows</b><p>

XyWrite, long a favorite of DOS users and writers, who praised its its command-line editing
capabilities and compact design now comes as a Windows program. The favored features exist in
XyWrite for Windows, but a few too many DOS roots remain. The most glaring is XyWrite's
inclusion and use of Bitstream Speedo fonts, an outdated font-handling technology. XyWrite
supports
Windows TrueType fonts, but it doesn't include any in the package. Not to worry though, your
Windows program contains quite a few fonts itself.<p>

The XyWrite interface is admirably clean. This is a great word processor if you like to maximize
your
viewable work space. In the default setup, a toolbar and formatting bar span the top of the screen,
leaving the rest open for editing. The View menu lets you add a ruler and command/ information
line.
Pressing F5 changes the information line into a command line, where you can perform XyWrite
functions just by typing a few letters. <p>

XyWrite lacks the fly-out tool tips common to most Windows applications. Fortunately, by 
moving
the mouse pointer over any button, a description of it appears on the information line. Also, if
you're
a Dos-user at heart and hate to leave your keypad to use your mouse, you'll love XyWrite's wealth
of keyboard commands.<p>

XyWrite's file management capabilities are terrific. Other word processors should make it as easy
to
copy, move, rename, and delete files. XyWrite's Open File box, however, is a mess; it lists every
file
in a directory, rather than just XyWrite files. <p>

XyWrite also ignores several other Windows conventions, including right-button menus and an
undo
feature. However, it does include a multilevel undelete function, but it's awkward to work with.
Working with graphics is an equally frustrating exercise, so if you use your word processor to
design
newsletters, you should probably avoid XyWrite.<p>

Overall, XyWrite is a comprehensive program that's still trying to shake off its Dos heritage.
Perhaps
future versions will embrace the Windows environment better, but lets hope they keep its speedy
operation, impressive file management, and compact size.<p>

<p>

<b><u>MAC PROGRAMS</u><p>

Word 6.01 for the Macintosh and Power Macintosh</b><p>

Ready for a surprise? Word 6.01 for the Macintosh is little more than a mirror-image of its
Windows
brother. It looks the same and acts the same; in essence, it is the same program. But before Mac
users
start forming a lynch mob at Microsoft's decision to copy rather than create, let's take a look at
what
Word for the Mac  offers the user: There are nice customizable three-dimensional toolbars and
dialog
boxes, helpful Wizards and loads of templates, great cross-platform compatibility, lots of well
laid-out
pop-up menus, and workgroup editing features. So, though it's a Windows clone, I think it is one
you
can live with.  <p>

I do not think that any of the  other Mac-based word processor can even come close to matching 
Word's automation features. Such things as Word's AutoCorrect that fixes common typos as you
type. An AutoText feature stores commonly used text and graphics for quick insertion into
documents. Word lets you automatically format headings, paragraphs, tables, and even entire
documents using predesigned styles.<p>

While it won't replace your desktop publishing software (it isn't Quark), Word is useful for many
DTP jobs such as brochures and newsletters. In addition to Wizards that offer step-by-step help in
creating such documents as newsletters and fax covers, Word offers some very impressive
modules
for editing equations, graphs, and tables. There's also WordArt, which generates special text
effects
but works only with TrueType fonts.<p>

Newbies to Word and word processing will appreciate the fly-out descriptions/tips that appear
when
the mouse pointer rests over a toolbar button. Word's 100 levels of undo and redo also add a
comfort
buffer. By combining dozens of advanced features with an elegant, easy-to-use interface, Word
achieves what few other word processors can: accessibility for the novice and capability for the
expert.<p>

So what's the downside of this seemingly wonderful program? Will, like the Windows version,
Word
for the Mac hugers for quite a chunk of your hard-drive space. A typical installation on a Power
Mac
requires 13MB of hard-disk space, whereas a full installation takes a whopping 27MB.
Fortunately,
Word's setup program lets you decide which features to install so you can customize a bit. <p>

<b>WordPerfect 3.5 for the Macintosh</b><p>

WordPerfect 3.5 for the Macintosh has all of the features that made version 3 a great word
processor
and now adds some valuable new Internet publishing tools. The program ships with the Netscape
Navigator Web  browser. The program allows you to import Web pages into WordPerfect and
then
easily preview the pages you've designed. WordPerfect can also convert a document to the Web's
HTML format and it can export pages for uploading onto the Web.<p>

The real beauty of WordPerfect is it's uncomplicated interface. The  toolbar On/Off buttons spans
the top of the screen allowing easy access to most of the programs features and functions. You
just
click a button, and the corresponding toolbar appears; click again, and it vanishes. The program
also
has the  MacinTalk feature which can recite documents for visually impaired users. <p>

WordPerfect offers some very nice drawing, table, and equation-editor tools. You can also drag
and
drop data across different applications. The new Make It Fit feature automatically adjusts
margins,
font size, and other page elements to make a document fit the precise number of pages that you
select. If you're tired of faxing or printing a two-page document with one page of full text and the
second page with only a few lines, this feature easily fits the entire text onto a single page. The
spell-checker now incorporates a featue called QuickCorrect which corrects spelling errors on the
fly. <p>

WordPerfect's automated features aren't as numerous as those found in Word, but those  included
with the program are well implemented and definately  worth a look. <p>

WordPerfect's online help could be better, and the Search For engine was a tad slow. 
WordPerfect's
price is one of its most attractive features. For a little more than half the cost of Word, you can
own
one of the most powerful word processors around. <p>

On a side note, Corel has purchased WordPerfect from Novell. It is still to be determined if they
will
continue to support both the Windows, Mac and Dos versions of Word Perfect. I visited their
web
site and did see some information on Windows, Mac and Dos versions, but that may change, so
check
out the site when you have time for updated information. It can be found at by pointing your
browser
to:<a href="http://www.corel.com/"> http://www.corel.com/ </a>on the web. <p>

<b>Worldsoft's WorldWrite 3.0</b><p>

This is a very powerful Mac word processor that wasn't written for a different operating system
and
won't try to get you to move to a new one. WorldSoft has designed an elegant word processor
exclusively for the Macintosh that won't require a hardware upgrade. <p>

A recent conversation with their marketing department informed me that many of the Mac
technical
people at WordPerfect have made the jump to WorldSoft (also based in Utah) rather than head to
Canada as a part of WordPerfect's move to Corel ownership. <p>

WorldWrite requires much less RAM and hard disk space than do Word and WordPerfect, yet it
offers many of  the powerful features you'll find in those programs. Because WorldWrite's native
Power Macintosh and 68K-based version are both very  fast and can help you work more quickly
and
efficiently than Word or WordPerfect have been known to operate. <p>

WorldWrite also offers cleaner screen redraw and better performance than Word and Word
Perfect
do. WorldWrite offers full WYSIWYG when working with every aspect of a document including
graphics, headers, footers, footnotes etc. Both Word Perfect and Word often require you to go
into
sub-layers and other modules to preview a document and work with graphics, headers and
footers,
etc.<p>

WorldWrite's interface is clean  and easy to use, while also remaining true to the Mac
environment.
It provides buttons for some of the most-used functions, without cluttering up the screen
unnecessarily with an excess of tool bars and floating palettes.<p>

WorldWrite requires less hard disk space and RAM than the leading, full-featured Macintosh
word
processors. The full install for the Power Mac version is just 5MB, and it only requires 2MB
available
RAM. <p>

At a cost of $129.00 this feature packed product is a good deal for all of your Mac word
processing
needs. The price had been only $99 prior to last week -guess someone has to pay for those new
techies from Word Perfect right? <p>

<b><u>DOS PROGRAMS</u></b><p>

<b>WordPerfect for DOS 6.1</b><p>

For those of you out there who stead-fastly refuse to give Microsoft the right time, you'll be glad
to
know there's one contender that hasn't given up the fight. WordPerfect started as a Dos program,
and
with WordPerfect<b> </b>for Dos 6.1, it's still is a very good one. It offers almost every feature
of its
Windows counterpart, costs $100 less, and requires half as much hard-disk space. Still, the
handwriting is on the wall: An optional graphical interface turns WordPerfect for Dos into a near
spitting image of WordPerfect for Windows, complete with toolbars and TrueType fonts. In fact,
the
right-button pops up context- sensitive menus.  Again, I mention that the Corel web site
&lt;<a href="http://www.corel.com/">http://www.corel.com/</a>&gt; does have information on
a Dos version, so it looks like last hurrah for
this legend is yet to be heard. <p>

<b>IN CLOSING</b><p>

Our favorite Windows 3x word processors was WordPerfect. For Windows 95 both Word for
Windows 95 and Lotus Word Pro 96 are very good programs. I think Word Pro 96 outshines
Word
for Windows by a nose, but again, to each his own. Microsoft's feature-rich package is extremely
easy
to use and, unsurprisingly, takes full advantage of Windows 95's features and abilities. Lotus
Word
Pro 96 boasts a major overhaul from it's roots in AmiPro, great new innovations, and excellent
support for Windows 95, and it costs much less than Word. <p>

I will mention that while I like WordPerfect 6.1, and it does work fairly well under Windows 95,
the
time is coming when software publishers will not continue to produce 16-bit applications. Even
though Windows 95 has not been  universally accepted and many have yet to upgrade from
Windows
3x or have gone straight to Windows NT, many of the software publishers have taken the lead
and
are producing only 32-bit applications. <p>

In respect to word processing, Windows 95 does offer some advantages a very nice interface,
folders
within folders, and an improved file management system.  Windows 95's also offers long file
names
and Plug 'n Play capability. With long file names, you'll never have to deal with  documents
entitled 
conlettr.wpd , rather than conferenceletter.wpd ever again. With Plug 'n Play capability, adding
new
hardware is a snap. Built-in wizards easily run you through the steps for adding new hardware
without changing dip switches and other related problems.<p>

If you do make the change to Windows 95, make sure you have at least 8MB (16MB would be
better
yet)  of RAM in your PC and an extra 50MB of  hard-drive space because Windows 95 takes up a
lot of space. And yes, if you are a Mac user, you've already got Plug and Play and long file
names.<p>

For the Macintosh, both Word and WordPerfect are exceptional word processors. Word's slick
interface and excellent online help make it a bit easier to use, but WordPerfect is a definate
powerhouse. It's greatly improved, and features some very good tools for Internet-WWW
publishing.

<h3><i></i>Microsoft Word 7.0 for Windows 95, and Word 6.0 for Windows
3.11</h3>
<h4>Ted Wood</h4>
<hr>
<p>

<i>As with all things, each person has their own opinion, and so, we offer Ted's review of
Microsoft
Word for Windows 95 to go along with our featured article..</i><p>

I'm going to make a confession, I've never liked Microsoft Word in any of its incarnations (Mac,
WinWord, or Word for DOS). Until about 6 months ago, I was a true blue fan of Lotus' AmiPro.
Then, they went and "upgraded" it on me (it is now "WordPro"). Instead of simply beefing it up
for
the 32-bit world, they revamped the entire program. It wasn't the same to me, it had lost all the
advantages it had over other word processors. It was slow, ugly, and unfriendly. I was somewhat
distraught at what my new word processor was going to be now that I had committed myself to
the
32-bit world of Windows 95.<p>

So I switched to WordPerfect 6.1. While not 32-bit, it was still my preference over moving to
Word.
I loved WP's powerful formatting functions, its raw speed, and its library of ready-to-use
templates.
Yet it still wasn't what I needed. I was looking for something that would seamlessly integrate with
Windows 95 (especially the new OLE standards for drag and drop) and still be friendly.
WordPerfect
was nice, but it just wasn't as intuitive as AmiPro had been and it wasn't fully Windows 95
compliant
(it crashed on several occasions, too numerous to count). <p>

I had to do it, I had to give Word another chance. I started out slowly, loading up Word 6.0 for
Windows (not a 32-bit application). I figured this would be a good way of training myself to use
Word while preparing  to move up to the newest version. After reading through what seems like
the
world's largest and most hostile manual, I put it to the test. I started working on some articles and
found that well, maybe Word wasn't so bad. After a short time, I decided that it was actually
pretty
good. Friendly, fast, lots of options, and some powerful formatting tools. This would be great, if
it
were only 32-bit. <p>

So now it was time to move up to Word 7.0 for Windows 95. I've heard unverified reports that
Word
7.0 is not "fully" 32-bit, and that they pushed it out for production and left some 16-bit code in it.
Since I couldn't imagine how I would be able to detect this, I didn't bother trying. I just enjoyed
the
fact that Word 7.0 is simply awesome.<p>

To start with,  there are  the manuals. Can we say "fabulous"? No more struggling  through a 900
page manual trying to figure out how to cut and paste. The new manual is a lean 200+ page
"guidebook".  It starts out with simple instructions on very basic functions (opening and creating
files,
editing files, etc.) and by the end of the guidebook, you're putting together complex technical
manuals to share over office networks. It's a dream come true. The manual is well indexed,
allowing
you to jump to precisely what function you don't understand. The format is a simple "<i>do this,
then
this, then this and now this will happen</i>" style that makes quick work of learning Word 7.0.
It's about
time someone got it right!<p>

Then there's the program itself. When you first run Word 7.0, it's a somewhat frightening
experience.
There are icons and toolbars everywhere. Fortunately, help is a simple mouse movement away as
all
you need to do is move the cursor over an icon in the toolbar and a balloon caption appears telling
you what the button does. While not a revolutionary idea, it's certainly nice to have as a standard
function.<p>

The help system takes its cue from Lotus' Wordpro, with a simple "ask the answer wizard"
function 
allowing you to ask plain English questions and receive a list of related answers and links to help
files.<p>

<b></b>The toolbar, like the rest of Word 7.0, is easily customizable. Tabbed dialog boxes lead
you through
the process of adding and/or removing icons from the toolbars, removing toolbars, and setting up
template documents.<p>

The templates make light work of setting up a document's format. Just choose "New" from the
"File"
menu, and the creation dialog kicks in. This dialog allows you to choose what type of document
you
would like to create, and even see a preview of the format before you actually use it.<p>

The majority of the tools that you use in Word 7.0 are pretty standard fare. From spell checking
to
grammar, Word 7.0 has them all. Since Word 7.0 is OLE compliant, you can drag and drop your
Excel spreadsheets and information from Access databases right into your documents and these
components will be automatically updated whenever you change them in their original application.
So if you've got the monthly expense report in a document in Word 7.0, and you update the
report
in Excel, the report will be displayed in its new form in the Word 7.0 document the next time you
open it.<p>

Another nice touch that comes courtesy of Word 7.0's Windows 95 compliance is that you can
actually cut or copy chunks of a Word document and past them as a "scrap" to the desktop. Then,
when you decide to reuse that chunk of text, you simply drag it from the desktop to the file you'd
like
to plug it in to. It's very handy when putting together lengthy documents containing paragraphs
that
you need to replace in a different section later.<p>

As a final note, Word 6.0 and Word 7.0 can be used to create HTML documents (for publishing
on
the Internet's World Wide Web.) Creating HTML documents in Word is accomplished by adding
the
Internet Assistant (IA) , which is freely available for download from Microsoft's homepage
(http://www.microsoft.com). After downloading Internet Assistant, it's a simple matter to install
and
use it. You format your web page by selecting the HTML template (in Word 7.0) and then putting
typing it up as any other normal document.  IA does a very good job of plugging in all the
appropriate
HTML tags into a document and placing the images. It also features a Web Browser that allows
you
to go online and browse the Web while still staying within Word.<p>

To sum it all up, I'm a complete convert. Take it from someone who swore they'd never use
Word,
it's worth making the switch!<p>

If you are using Windows 3.1x, and are planning on staying with it, I would suggest making the
move
to Word 6.0 if you haven't already. If you have, you already know the benefits of it. If you're a
Windows 95 user, it's time to move up to Word 7.0 and see what word processing under
Windows
95 was meant to be like.<b><p>

<hr>
<p>
In honor of the opening of baseball season I decided to compile a list of baseball related sites
for this month's Cool Links page. Some of the sites are definately home run material while others
don't even get to first base. But give them all a fair chance cause my opinion might not be
yours.<p>

<p>

<b>Baseball On The Net:</b> This is a pretty cool site with a prototype Baseball Search Tool,
containing pointers to over 1200 Internet baseball resources with 2000 searchable keywords.
&lt;<a
href="http://www.skypoint.com/subscribers/ashbury/_hhdir/hhhotlinks.html">http://www.skypoint.com/subscribers/ ashbury/_hhdir/hhhotlinks.html</a>&gt;<p>

<p>

<b>Philip's Baseball Page:</b> Here you'll find info on Major League Baseball (MLB), National
League
Football (NFL) and National Basketball Association (NBA) teams. The Cactus League home
page covers baseball's spring training scene in Arizona.
&lt;<a
href="http://www.gulf.net/~gbamonte/baseball.htm">http://www.gulf.net/~gbamonte/baseball.htm</a>&gt;<p>

<p>

<b>Wayne's World - Sports - Baseball:</b> This page claims that by "Using the power of
computers
and telecommunications to provide baseball fans worldwide with instant access to scores and
play-by-play coverage for all Major League Baseball games, Our Web pages include detailed
descriptions of every play, as well as the current game situation, and are updated after every
pitch."  I think is does a pretty good job of living up to its claim.

<p>

<b>More Baseball links: </b>This site has a lot of links to baseball related sites including the
Arizona
Diamondbacks Homepage (expansion team in '98) and the New York Yankees Hall of Fame
page. &lt;<a href="http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/

<p>

<b>Major League:</b> It's all here -- the latest box scores, league leaders, standings -- but the
slickly
packaged Major League Baseball@Bat page, an official production, lacks soul. Obviously, you'll
find a bounty of online material, also including press releases.
&lt;http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com/mlb/&gt;<p>

<p>

<b>Baseball Archive Web Page:</b> Lacking graphics of any kind, the Baseball Archive Web
Page is a
utilitarian resource, featuring 1995 and 1996 schedules for each team, two separate
player-evaluation reports, and an FTP server.  &lt;<a

<b>Alt.sports.baseball.calif-angels: </b>This Usenet newsgroup is devoted to California Angels,

<h2>Spycraft: <i>The Great(est) Game</i></h2>
<h3>Ted Wood</h3>
<hr>
<p>

It just doesn't get any better than this! <a 
href="http://www.activision.com/">Activision,</a> after scoring a major 
success with
MechWarrior2, has followed up with Spycraft: <i>The Great Game</i>.  In Spycraft, you assume
the
role of a secret agent attempting to unravel an assassination plot by traveling the world collecting
clues, researching data, and interacting with characters.<p>

Spycraft is an amazing visual treat. With live action clips, 35mm film clips, and outstanding
animation, it brings the world of spies to life. As you get deeper into the game, you'd almost
swear that this stuff was really going on, and that it was up to you to save the world from a
possibly devastating revival of the Cold War. Many of the characters and events in this game are
real, or at least based on factual data, which makes it all the more believable and immersive.<p>
<img src="shooter.jpg" align="right">
Unlike the spy world of popular film this one is not populated with guns and action. Instead you
are forced to survive by your wits, although at times a gun does prove handy. In the early stages
of the game, you are taken to the CIA training base, known as "The Farm". Here you study up on
marksmanship, electronic surveillance, and a host of other espionage oriented techniques.<p>

After some intensive training, the quest to find the assassins  and halt their evil plot begins. As you
begin <b></b>to dig through image data, databases, news reports and more, you'll discover clues
and hints
to even more clues and hints, which in the end lead you to the trail of the assassins and
conspirators. <p>

"Expect no mercy and give none"  seems to be the dominant theme of this game ,with sticky
situations and even a few moral dilemmas popping up to make your life tougher. Torture,
coercion, sabotage, murder, it's all in there, and just when you think you've mastered those tools,
there's a slew of electronic devices at your disposal. In Spycraft you've got to use voice
recognition software, visual identification devices,  and the KAT (Kennedy Assassination Tool)
which I won't even try to describe. If you're "wired" (i.e you already have an internet connection
and either Netscape 2.0 or Internet Explorer 2.0) you can take the game on-line and find more
clues scattered about the actual World Wide Web.<p>
<img src="intelink.jpg" align="left">
This is an intense game, it gobbles up hours of free time as it becomes and addiction. Don't expect
to finish it quickly (I'm still working on it) or easily. It's too much fun to be one of those games
that you try to finish as quickly as possible, and if you're one of those who only enjoys finishing a
game, and not all the little adventures along the way, I'd suggest you skip Spycraft. It's designed
to be more of an experience than a quick game.<p>

If you're ready for the adventure of a lifetime, Spycraft is for you, but I have to warn you, this
game requires a serious system to run it properly. On my old 486, it runs okay, but I had to find
some workarounds (like using the DOS version instead of the Windows 95 version) to get it to
run at all. Make sure your system can handle the requirements, or you may end  up having to
return it, which would be sad, since this is such a great game I'd hate to see anyone miss it.<p>

<pre><i>System Requirements:</i> (both DOS and Windows 95 Versions come packaged
together)
General Requirements:
486 DX2/66 Processor
8 MB RAM
Double Speed CD ROM
30 MB Free Hard Drive space
VESA local bus or PCI Video
16 bit High Color SVGA Monitor and Video card
100% Sound Blaster Compatible Sound Card
Additional MS-DOS requirements
MS-DOS 6.0 or higher
Additional Windows 95 Requirements:
Windows 95 Operating System
100% Windows 95 Compatible system running ONLY the latest 32 bit drivers
for all hardware
</pre>
<i>If your system doesn't meet all the Windows 95 requirements, you can still run Spycraft under
DOS (or in DOS under Windows 95), it just takes some working around a few problems.</i><p>

<h2>1984 Revisited: As The Government Moves Toward
Internet Censorship, What's Next?</h2>
<h3><hr>
</h3>
First off,  I have to say that those people out there who like to prey on children for their sexual
kicks deserve the harshest punishments our legal system can provide. I do not want anyone giving
pornographic material to my child, whether it is printed, filmed, videotaped, or brought into my
personal computer though the Internet. On the other hand, I have never liked Government
sticking its nose into my personal freedoms either.<p>

That said, the Communications Decency Act, part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 signed
by President Clinton earlier this year, is in my opinion a poorly thought-out, unwarrented and
damaging piece of legislation that seems to have been created by persons who are ignorant about
both technology and  politics.<p>

I'm sure that many congressional supporters of the so-called "decency legislation" acted in what
they believe to be good faith, with a sincere desire to protect children from online-lunitics and
weirdos. But many feel that the law Congress just made is more harmful to our children than
anything they are likely to encounter on the Internet; and it may be dangerous for us adults as
well. It isn't a case of blocking indecent materials that bothers me, it's the fact that Congress can
take personal freedom or choice away in the blink of an eye. And let's face it, many of those in
Congress are not of the highest moral fiber  either. It is very sad that folks have used the Internet
to spread sex, but lets face it in our society (as much as we won't admit it) sex sells. We see it in
our advertising mediums, in books, magazines and at the movies and TV and adult orientated
CD-ROMs are among the top sellers in that industry.  I'm neither condemning or praising it, just
pointing out that the Internet is not the only place that kids can be tempted to "perverted" ideas.
Will Congress move to ban books and movies next, as some communities have already done?<p>

The law is also stupid, because it assumes that the U.S. Congress can regulate an international
computer network that is 99 percent private and that is composed of users who are from all over
the world. Already I have seen sites that have been banned in the US, popping up on foreign
servers, offering the same x-rated information they did before the law went into effect. Is the next
step to make a vain attempt to isolate the US portion of the net from the world? <p>

Additionally, the law assumes that the Government can provide a better moral compass for  kids
than parents can. Based n the many abuses and morally damaging things our government has done
around the world, I for one do not think they can provide much of a moral compass for anything.
It also discounts the effectiveness of such user-controlled programs as Surf Watch, which is so
thorough at blocking out x-rated sites (it looks for keywords and flesh colored graphics) that it
even blocks the White House's World Wide Web site from view because it contains the word
couples.<p>

Congress, must have sensed it was on shaky legal ground when it passed the Communications
Decency Act, because it made a special provision in the law for a "fast track" judicial review all
the way to the Supreme Court. Whether or not the law is struck down, the forces (mostly those
on the religious right I presume) that want to curb the spread of obscenity and indecency from the
Internet in order to protect our  children will surely not rest as long as the Internet continues to
expand and grow in importance.<p>

Here's why the Communications Decency Act and its inevitable successors represent a threat to
anyone who uses online systems, whether they work in a home office or simply use the Net to do
home banking.<p>

*To comply with the new law, both Internet and online service providers will be compelled to
track, and most likely divulge, our electronic travels through cyberspace to a far greater degree
than ever before. <p>

Online and Internet access providers will now have to do everything possible to make sure their
customers are identifiable. This means they might ask for a credit card when registering, and then
keep track of what those people do when they are online; such as keeping records about a
person's e-mail comings and goings. Providing information on an individual's work and play in
cyberspace could become as routine as the phone company's ability to provide law enforcement
officials with complete information on a person's phone calls. If this seems far-fetched to you
think about this. America Online and the other services give law enforcement officials access to
private e-mail files, as long as the government provides valid search warrants, which are becoming
increasingly common in cyberspace. I for one have nothing to hide, but I resent that fact that
someone may be able to track my movements through cyberspace as easily as following me
around all day. <p>

If we don't protect our individual freedoms here and now, we  risk losing more of them in the
future.  It would seem that the more access people have to new means of communication the
more government interference will arise. The first amendment to the Constitution states:
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people
peacefully to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances."  In a
Presidential election year I begin to wonder which part of the "make no law" portion of the above
amendment that Congress doesn't seem to understand.<p>

<h3>McKenzie &amp; Co.; Action Packed 5 CD Adventure Girls will Love! </h3>
<h4>Martin P. Waterman &amp; Krystal Ann Doiron</h4>
<hr>
<p>

It was Krystal's 12th birthday party and she and her friend Lisa came to me with an open Teen
Magazine pointing out an advertisement.  "You can get free software, can't you?" said Lisa.  I
told her to write down the information and I would talk to my editor.  I called Her Interactive, a
division of American Laser Games to find out why the girls were so excited.  My first thought
was that perhaps the company, known for their games which appeal to a predominately male
audience, wanted to make software for girls.  In these days of political correctness I am not trying
to suggest that some girls can't be equally vicious and effective at games, but one of the criticisms
of the software market is that there is a notably large absence of software for young girls.<p>

My assumptions were partially correct.  The mission of Her Interactive is to "create a multimedia
world for young women; a world inhabited by savvy goals with sure-she-can attitudes.  By
providing true gaming experiences, edutainment and a comprehensive on-line service, the
company hopes to inspire girls to explore the wonders of computer technology."  The company
describes their software as being "An interactive motion picture game" and its goal is to increase
the number of female multimedia gamers from a dismal 12%.<p>

When I called the company, I talked with Gail, the PR woman.  When I told her I wanted to
review the program there was an uncomfortable pause.  I added that "Krystal, a twelve year old
girl would be doing most of the reviewing".  She was relieved.  An important component of the 5
disk set is how to do make-overs and the software comes complete with lipstick. <p>

The software has three elements.  Interacting with cool friends, shopping and make-overs and fun
mini games.  It also comes with a super bonus music CD with twelve newly released songs by
four bands being the Strawberry Zots, Poet, Cool Notes and Tee Green.<p>

After Krystal had spent some time on the game, I put some questions to her. After all, kids are the
toughest and often the best critics. <p>

Martin:  What is your favorite part of the program?<p>

Krystal:  My favorite part of the program is playing McKenzie &amp; Co which is the interactive
movie where you meet the guys and all that.  There are two characters, Kim or Carly and you
choose which one you will be.  I went out with Brandon as Carly and we went out for lunch at a
restaurant.  I went out with Derrick also as Carly and went to the music store.  As Kim, I asked
out Steven but he said no.<p>

Martin:  I understand you went shopping?<p>

Krystal:  Yes, but before you go shopping or put on make-up you have to have a date.  You can
also put on make-up in the bedroom. I went to the Bayview mall to five or six stores.  One time I
had two hundred and some dollars and bought jeans, shoes, top, shorts, and a prom dress  I also
bought a bathing suit in the sport shop.  You get to try them on and see how the different
combinations look on you before you buy them.<p>

<p>

Martin:  What about the makeup?<p>

Krystal:  You go in the bedroom and you have to click the mirror.  And then it zooms up and then
you click the little make-up case and then it shows her face.  Then you click on mascara, eye liner,
lipstick and then chooses shades.  It is kind of like a paint program.  It is one of my favorite parts
of the program. <p>

Martin:  What else did you like?<p>

Krystal:  I liked the answering machine and the telephone because you click it and you can talk to
your friends and call them back on the telephone.<p>

<b></b>Martin:  What did you think of your online friends?<p>

Krystal:  They were cool.<p>

Martin:  Did you like the music CD?<p>

Krystal:  I listened to the whole CD.  I did not care for it.<p>

Martin:  What about the games?<p>

Krystal:  I was on easy level and they were still hard.  There was algebra and we had not taken it
yet.  The history questions were also hard because they were Shakespeare.  There were not any
games that I really liked.   <p>

Martin:   Anything else you disliked about the program?<p>

Krystal:  I don't like that there is so many CD's because there is one for each guy and you keep
having to go back and forth between the guy CD and the main CD.<p>

Martin: Anything else interesting happen to you in the interactive movie?<p>

Krystal: I quit school and when I got home my parents grounded me for a year.<p>

Martin:  Would you recommend the program to your friends?<p>

Krystal:  Yes, because it was interesting and fun.<p>

The game also comes with information on breast cancer awareness and part of the proceeds from
all Her Interactive products are donated for breast cancer research and other related programs. 
<p>

The requirements of the game are not kid stuff.  Recommended muscle is a 486 DX2 50, 8 MB of
RAM Multimedia system as well as local bus graphics and card with VESA compatible drivers. 
They also recommend a Pentium for optimum performance.  The program will run under both
Windows 3x and Windows 95.  The game is rated for ages 6 right up to adult.  The software sells
for $ 59.95.  A demo disk is available for about $ 3.95.<p>

<b>NET DAY CELEBRATED</b>: President Clinton and Vice President Gore participated in
ceremonies
to celebrate Net Day, an effort to wire 20% of California's public schools to the Internet by the

of this school year.  About 200 private companies, coordinated by Sun Microsystems, participated
in the event, and more than 3,000 Net Day kits were mailed to California schools, each worth
about

Netscape
Communications has cut a deal with CompuServe to license its Navigator browsing software,
allowing CompuServe's 4 million subscribers to use Navigator to surf the Web.  Key to the
CompuServe deal is access to Netscape's Mac version of Navigator.  The nonexclusive pact
undermines Microsoft's much narrower arrangement with the online provider for its Internet
Explorer
browser.  CompuServe says it plans to offer subscribers a choice:  "Our strategy is to be
browser-neutral so that people can use whatever browser they want," says a CompuServe official.

<h2>Compadre Is User Friendly</h2>
<h3>D.J. Haynes</h3>
<hr>
<p>

Compadre from Three D Graphics is an extremely useful product. Designed to function as an
extension of Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, Compadre offers a vast assortment of
everything you need to create fantastic PowerPoint presentations. Including templates, textures,
video clips and music, sound effects and buttons; all fine-tuned to within the Windows 95
environment.<p>

So you ask what makes this CD-ROM any different from all the other collections of clip art,
textures and the like. Well, this program was designed specifically to integrate with PowerPoint
for Windows 95. It comes with a Windows 95 Setup Wizard that creates shortcuts to all of the
CD elements in convenient places within a PowerPoint folder. So we have ease of use here plus
an outstanding assortment of items that will help to make your PowerPoint presentation look
great, run smoothly and wow your audience.<p>

The CD contains 152 tiling textures for just about every background or fill look you could ever
want. The textures are grouped into type categories such as wood, stone or marble textures.
Thumbnails of each group are easily viewable to help make your selection process a simple one.
<p>

There's also 120 design templates that can be used in several ways with PowerPoint. They are
grouped into 45 types, each with three or four templates in each type. <p>

The program ships with 35 music clips in both Midi and Wav format. While 35 clips should allow
for a wide range of choices for all of your musical presentation needs this part of the program falls
somewhat short. The standard fair of classical music such as the 1812 Overture and Beethoven's
5th are here as is a collection of Christmas and religious tunes, a few opera selections and some
tried and true stuff like Auld Lang Syne or Hail to the Chief. What's missing are any nice
selections of jazz, hip hop, rock or new age stuff. In today's multi-cultural world your
presentations have to appeal to a wide range of people and Compadre misses the mark here.<p>

Compadre includes 96 sound effects in .WAV format. The selection here is pretty good and
should suffice for most of your presentation needs.<p>

A selection of 23 video clips in the Microsoft .AVI Video for Windows format are included on
the disk. The clips are provided in "postage stamp" size (120x160 pixels) at 15 frames per second.
They are resizable to suit your needs. Here again, the selection is pretty standard fair and nothing
remarkably outstanding. An airplane flying, a flag waving, a building imploding, cars racing,
fireworks, etc.<p>

There are 1400 multimedia buttons with the program. They are small Bitmap files that can easily
be placed within a PowerPoint presentation as active buttons. Yes, 1400 buttons is a big selection,
but Compadre has separated them by type and made it easy for you to choose the exact color and
style button for your needs. <p>

The program also comes with 8 sample presentations that run through the motions and show all
of the bells and whistles that Compadre has to offer a user.<p>

Even with the lame music clips, I found this program to be quite useful in creating PowerPoint
presentations. I however have found another use for this program as well. With the wide selection
of textures, templates, buttons etc this CD-ROM has a wealth of materials that can be used in
creating web pages. While many of the textures and buttons can be found searching the web, here
is a wide selection all rolled into one CD-ROM. The program comes with a nice printed manual
that lets you take a look at most of what it has to offer before you even crack open the disk. At a
cost of $49.95 the price is well worth the amount of items that the CD-ROM comes packed with.
If you are doing both PowerPoint presentations and web pages then this is the CD-ROM for you.
<p>

A demo of Compadre can be found on the web at: <a href="http://www.
threedgraphics.com/compadre">http://www. threedgraphics.com/compadre</a>.
Microsoft also maintains a web site for PowerPoint users at: <a

</b><h2>Rapid Application Development: A Look at Microsoft
Visual Basic and Layout from Objects Inc.</h2>
<h3>Ted Wood</h3>
<hr>
<p>

Rapid application development (RAD) has long promised to be a boon to the computing
community. The idea is to develop a method of designing software so that the whole process is
quick, painless, and nearly effortless. The tools used should be easy to learn, powerful, and  allow
the designer to interface his/her freshly minted application with other applications, databases, and
file types.  <p>

Microsoft has long understood the need for a wide base of programmers of all skill levels, and so
several years ago they introduced what is considered by many to be one of the best tools available
in the RAD field, Visual Basic (VB). VB, since its inception, has allowed application designers to
create a wide variety of programs and make them available much more quickly than they would be
had they been developed under more traditional programming methods. While some of the more
"serious" programmers have long considered Visual Basic a "toy" and not a serious design tool,
many are now finding that when it comes to designing programs for use on a Windows based
system, VB simply can't be beat in terms of speed, ease of use, learning curve, and simplicity. <p>

Another company, Objects, Inc. has taken a shot at making programming even easier than Visual
Basic does. A few years ago this company released their own software development tool which
was dubbed Layout. Layout takes programming to an entirely new level of simplicity.<p>

Traditional programming code (which is even used in Visual Basic) is thrown out the window
completely. Instead of the user needing to understand programming code (or just code for short)
the developer uses a flowchart to design applications. All the commonly used pieces of code (for
example, code to call up the printer and have it print out your data file) are pre-compiled for the
user and is referred to as a "Blackbox". These chunks of code (which you never actually see the
code itself only a description) are placed into a flowchart, designed by the programmer. User
interfaces (Windows, input boxes, etc.) are referred to as "cards".The programmer, actually
"designer" may be more appropriate, plugs all the Blackboxes and cards  necessary to the creation
of the application into the flowchart in order. According to the manuals,  Layout promises that
just about anyone can put together powerful, useful applications in a short amount of time.<p>

I've had a chance to use both Visual Basic 4.0 Standard Edition, and Layout 3.01 (the most recent
version) both for Windows 95 (Layout will also work fine under Windows 3.1x). <p>

<b>The Documentation:</b><p>

Hands down Visuall Basic 4.0 wins. The manual is clean, precise and comes filled with useful
examples. If you're not a fan of paper manuals, there are  copies of the manual stored in the Help
Files on the CD.  The examples are well explained, simple to set up, and actually quite fun to use.
The on-line tutorials are uncomplicated  and well worth taking the effort to walk through.<p>

Layout's documentation, while not the worst I've ever seen, could certainly use some work. The
package comes with a total of five books consisting of a "Read me first" booklet,  two small
startup guides, one tutorial style manual, and one programmer's reference. The startup guides are
not of much use, they are more of an introduction to what Layout is, the ideas behind it, and a
short history. The tutorial manual is fair, but it does not give nearly enough useful examples to
learn from. These tutorials are incredibly simplistic  and scarcely scratch the surface of how to use
layout for designing powerful applications. Worst of all, some of the screen shots used in manual
must have come from a previous version of the software as I could not find the same  screens
anywhere when I was using Layout.<p>

The programmer's reference is nice, but does not nearly give the reader enough information about
the Blackboxes, cardfiles, and samples supplied with Layout. The reference attempts to explain
what a Blackbox is used for and sometimes cites a brief (very brief) example of it in use.
Unfortunately, the example is usually more cryptic than the explanation.<p>

<b>The Software</b><p>

Visual Basic 4.0 wins again. The interface is smooth and slick, showing the user how a real design
tool should look. The Toolbox is simple to understand, and by passing the cursor over any icon
on it will give you the name of the tool itself. The names of the tools (or Objects) are straight
forward enough so that you get a instant idea of what the tool will do when plugged into the
application.<p>

With VB 4.0 you first design the user interface, then plug in the code to make everything work.
The interface is designed on "forms" , which are essentially windows containing buttons, text,
images, etc.  After placing the controls necessary on the interface, the next step is to write code
for the events that occur. For example, if there is a command button titled "Click me for Help",
the programmer must attach a piece of code to the button so that it responds in some manner to
the user's mouseclick.  Being event-driven (as Microsoft refers to Visual Basic's methodology)
allows the programmer to create a logically flowing application. You can build a program in small
pieces by first designing and coding each event, then putting all the events together on an
interface. Of course, you will  have to learn the essentials of BASIC programming under Visual
Basic, but the language is easy to grasp. With the help of the manual (and perhaps one of the
"Visual Basic for Dummies" books) the whole process becomes rather effortless. That's not to say
VB 4.0 will make someone a master programmer overnight, but it's an excellent way to start
learning the fundamentals and then work your way up to powerful designs.<p>

Layout promises ease, but delivers mostly frustration. It seems to suffer from over-simplifying the
programming process.. Without the ability to truly manipulate code, it becomes a disappointing
experience. <p>

The user interface in Layout is created by designing cards, which in turn may contain links to
other cards, controls, text, images, or pieces of code in the form of Blackboxes. It seems simple
enough, you need only open up the card editor, place the necessary buttons, controls, boxes, etc.
on the card and save it. Unfortunately, it's just not that easy. First, the card editor is sluggish and
overbearing. It takes several steps to create a simple click button, and it only gets worse. The
toolbox, which contains all the elements needed for designing a card, is nowhere near as clean as
the Visual Basic toolbox. Each button is an unlabled icon, and passing the cursor over one (in an
attempt to see the label pop up, as it does in VB4.0) accomplishes nothing. The buttons just sit
there staring at you, mocking your attempts at using them. Page 36 of the manual  lists all the
buttons and their related uses, but who is going to keep the manual handy all the time? I admit
that it is possible to memorize each button, but being realistic, it shouldn't be necessary, and some
of us are simply forgetful.<p>

Writing code in Layout simply means attaching a Blackbox to a card, or inserting a Blackbox into
the flowchart where it is needed. Again, this is easier said than done. Some Blackboxes cannot be
attached to cards and some are designed only to be used with cards. If you attempt to attach an
incompatible Blackbox to a card, the system responds by stating the impossibility of this attempt,
and that you should attempt to build a procedure that uses the Blackbox and attach the procedure
to the card. Soon, you end up buried in procedure after procedure, all in an attempt to simply get
the Blackbox to activate when you need it.<p>

<b>The Test</b><p>

After studying the manuals for an equal amount of time and tinkering with the tutorials and
sample  applications, I set about creating my  own application.   The   test application was to be a
very simple invoicing program. The program would have no pull down menu bar. For sake of
simplicity it would consist only of click buttons, input boxes (for text information), and a few
drop down list boxes. The program would allow the user to create a file for each customer, assign
each a file number, and each file would contain an invoice history which would be accessed
through the drop down list. <p>

Using Layout, I quite honestly never finished this project, and never got very far. After three
weeks I managed to create a workable interface. Beyond that, I couldn't get anything to work
correctly. I found myself cheating  by stealing chunks of the sample applications and using them to
create mine. I have nothing against "recycling" code, but I don't think it should be the only way
one can complete a project. The project was deemed an abysmal failure.<p>

Next it was VB's turn. After four days of coding I had a fully functional interface, about 50% of
the actual application coded, and was  considering expanding the project to interface with
databases. <p>

VB 4.0 allows you to interface easily with databases (preferably Microsoft Access) so this idea
didn't seem too far fetched or complex. I have yet to recycle code from VB's tutorial applications,
and probably won't need to. I actually look forward to working on more projects in VB.<p>

If you're looking to get into programming or seeking a RAD tool to make your life a little easier,
Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 is definitely worth looking into. It's ease of use, superior
documentation, and overall effectiveness are well suited to a fast-paced programming
environment.<p>

Layout, on the other hand, suffers from trying to be too much for too many people. It's almost
overzealous in its efforts to simplify things. The ability to manipulate code is too limited, the
Blackbox concept too confining, and the documentation lacking. Perhaps if I had understood
what some of the Blackboxes were doing behind the scenes I would have found it a much more
useful tool. Instead, I found that it takes too much out of the designer's hands thus constricting
the design environment.<p>

<h2>Business Encyclopedia</h2>
<h3>Craig Crossman</h3>
<hr>
<p>

Over the years, I've looked at many reference collections on CD-ROM. Some are well thought
out, in content and organization. Others simply take reference works and shovel them onto a
CD-ROM (better known as shovelware). <p>

A new series of small-business reference materials, from Allegro New-Media, is rich in content
and layout, probably due in part to Allegro teaming up with Entrepreneur Magazine to produce
the six new CD-ROM titles in the business collection.<p>

The headliner, entitled Small Business Encyclopedia ($59.95), offers help to new and existing
businesses. The encyclopedia covers many aspects of business: writing a business plan, the do's
and don'ts of buying a business, evaluating franchise opportunities, home-based businesses, legal
forms, paying yourself, SBA loans and start-up financing.<p>

The CD also includes over 100 forms and spreadsheet templates. Examples include "Planning
Tools" such as a revenue model, capital equipment summary and demographic comparisons, and
"Management Forms," which offers production schedules, time logs and a performance
report.<p>

"Legal Tools" supplies applications for patents and trademarks; additional categories include
marketing, finance, credit forms, accounting, sales and inventory.<p>

The CD also has full-motion video that deals with subjects like business ethics, family-run
businesses and strategic planning.<p>

Everything is well-organized with an easy-to-use interface that lets you select topics.<p>

Also in the Entrepreneur Magazine CD series are Guide to Raising Money ($29.95), 1000
Business Forms and Letters ($29.95), 25 Hottest Businesses for the '90s ($29.95), Top
Low-Investment Businesses for the '90s ($29.95) and Best Part-Time Businesses for the '90s
($29.95). Each title offers a video guide to its features. <p>

<h2>Learn along with Pooh and Friends</h2>
<h3>Rob Penny</h3>
<hr>
<p>

Everyone seems to love that fat little honey bear Winnie the Pooh, and in  Winnie the Pooh and
the Honey Tree, kids join the willy-nilly silly ol' bear as he hunts for his favorite nectar. Along the
way they can learn about words, play games, sing songs, and even learn a few words of
Spanish.<p>

This Disney Animated Storybook CD-ROM can be read by your child on screen or thay can listen
to it read to them. The words are highlighted as they are spoken. Kids can also listen to the
definition of a word.<p>

The disc features five sing-along songs, including the "Winnie the Pooh" theme song, as well as
four games that introduce kids to learning skills. In one game, Piglet asks your child to help find
toys that Christopher Robin wants to play with. "I'm looking for something green that floats in the
air," says Piglet. When your child clicks on the green balloon, it disappears and they are 
congratulated on their success in choosing the right object.<p>

The animations that kids activate by clicking on objects change with subsequent clicks. One click,
for example, causes a troop of ants to march into Pooh's honey jar. Click again, and smoke from
Pooh's campfire changes into a cloud and drenches the marching column, causing it to abandon its
mission. The animations are all very colorful and well drawn, but hey it's Disney right.<p>

The program is best suited for three- to six-year-olds, but like Pooh, kids of all ages will love it.

<h2>The Cardinal 28.8 External V.34 Fax Modem</h2>
<h3>T. Accetta</h3>
<hr>
<p>

The other day I called a computer mail order firm to see what monitors they had in stock. With
the
help of my new modem I was also able to view information on those monitors while I spoke to a
sales
person who answered my questions. This was accomplished thanks to the Cardinal 28.8 External
V.34 Fax Modem's VoiceView feature, which allows voice and data transfer during a single
phone
call, it was very easy to preview information on buying a new monitor from a mail order house
right
over the phone/PC while I spoke to the sales person.<p>

The technology behind how this modem operates is know as Digital simultaneous voice and data
(DSVD). It basically  lets modems send and receive data over  a phone line, while callers are
talking
on the same line. A few retailers are beginning to use this new interactive service to enhance their
sales operations. I have also seen some technical support hotlines begin to use it to diagnose PC
problems while talking on the line with the machine's owner. However, for this to work, both
parties
must have the VoiceView software and a DSVD modem. So, there are not a lot of these two-way
conversations going on yet. <p>

The Cardinal modem I tested is designed to do double duty as an answering machine and fax
server.
Using its FaxWorks Voice and Data Communications software, it's easy to set up any of 999
voicemail boxes, with an individual greeting for each one. The software also lets you set up a fax
server. This allows your PC to become a valuable tool for your business (like it isn't already right).
Customers can call your PC and press a code to request a document be sent to their own fax
machines. The service is easy to set up, but you must save documents as graphics files in order to
transmit them by fax.<b>.</b><p>

Now I know what you are saying about Cardinal modems, and I will admit that I have seen some
of
their eariler products and they were not that good, but this device is a first-rate, DSVD Hayes-
compatible modem. I'm sure you can buy a US Robotic or a Hayes or some other expensive
modem
that will do the same job. But, for $210 (Windows 3.1, DOS, Macintosh) from Cardinal
Technologies, (800) 775-0899, (717) 293-3000 this modem is a real workhorse. <b><p>

<h2>MORE MODEMS...</h2>
<h3>Bill Franklin</h3>
<hr>
<p>

This month we decided to take a look at some 28.8bps modems now on the market. Most of the
units tested are all built around an identical set of chips from Rockwell International, which
incorporate data, fax, and telephony (mainly voice-mail) capabilities. All the modems include both
data and fax capabilities. However, only some of them have voice-mail features. All the modems
come bundled with a handful of "free trial" packages for the major online services. Some come
with more complete Internet software. The modems tested are all pretty good values, ranging
from an low of $149.99 to $299. A year ago, these prices would have only bought you a slow
14.4-kbps modem.<p>

<i>AmQuest, AM2814IV-HY</i><p>

AmQuest is a fairly new company on the block. The AM2814IV-HY is a solidly built internal
V.34 internal modem that comes packaged with Cheyenne's BitWare V/F/D (Voice/Fax/Data)
software for Windows, offering full voice mail, along with Fax-on-Demand and pager capabilities.
External and speaker jacks are located on the rear panel; you can also use your telephone to
record messages and retrieve your voice mail.<p>

The DIP switch for changing modem settings (COM port and IRQ) is easily accessible through
the rear panel. The AM2814IV-HY isn't Plug and Play-certified, but it wasn't difficult to set up on
a Windows 95 PC.<p>

<i>Best Data Products, 2834VF SMART ONE</i><p>

This modem is an internal V.34 unit that's easy to install and easy to use, but provides few extra
features. It comes with BitWare F/V/D software for full fax, data, and voice-mail capabilities, and
offers back-panel switches for setting COM ports and IRQs. The 2834VF isn't Windows 95 Plug
and Play-compatible, but its manual is particularly clear and helpful for resolving setup
problems.<p>

<i>Boca Research, V.34 OFFICE COMMUNICATOR</i><p>

At a street price of $222, the V.34 is a good value for small business owners. It's packed with a
number of features including voice mail (including caller ID support) and fax, a full-duplex
speakerphone and Radish VoiceView for switching between voice and data on the same call.  <p>

Installation in a Windows 95 systems was a breeze because the hardware is certified for Plug and
Play. It wasn't much more difficult under Windows 3.1, because the unit comes with software that
tests your PC for free resources and sets the modem up automatically. There are no DIP switches
or jumpers to mess with. The manual is very well laid out and helpful. <p>

In addition to coming bundled with the standard free-trail AOL and CompuServe software, The
Office Communicator also provides the Internet Passport CD-ROM, which contains a suite of
Internet software (including Netcom NetCruiser) and trial subscriptions to various Internet service
providers. <p>

<i>Creative Labs, MODEM BLASTER 28.8</i><p>

This one seems to be aimed at serious game players who want shared-modem gaming playing
features. It comes bundled with a CD-ROM that includes the games Descent Destination Saturn,
WarCraft Special Edition, and the shareware editions of Doom and Heretic. At $150 this is a
good low cost entry to the internet.<p>

Also included is Delrina 4-in-1, a nicely designed suite of WinFax Lite, DOSFax Lite, and COMit
Lite for both DOS and Windows. This modem uses jumpers that aren't accessible when your PC's
closed up, and it's not Plug and Play-certified for Windows 95. But the manual is very capably
written, and there is a good technical support staff - though the number is not toll free.<p>

<i>Hayes Microcomputer Products, ACCURA 288 V.34/V.FC + FAX<p>

</i>Even though Hayes has had its problems lately (like filing for bankruptcy and being targeted
for
takeover attempts by several companies), they are still the company that started the modem
movement and almost all modems today are still labeled as  "Hayes compatible."<p>

The Accura 228 V.34 + Fax is the external version of Hayes's low-end V.34 modem. It's compact,
very easy to install, and works fine. Hayes's own Smartcom data and fax software comes with the
product. Don't look for voice-mail features cause they aren't here. The cost is high, $260 but it is
the industry standard right?<p>

<i>Microcom, DESKPORTE 28.8P</i><p>

Microcom isn't a well-known name, but it is as much a standard setter as Hayes: The MNP
(Microcom Networking Protocol) used for error correction and data compression in all the
modems covered here is licensed from the company.<p>

Sporting a street price of about $250, the Plug and Play-certified external DeskPorte 28.8P is on
the expensive side, especially since it doesn't have voice capabilities (and they can't be added) and
doesn't come with data communications or Internet software. It does, however, come with
FaxWorks.<p>

Unlike any other modem covered here, the Microcom has both serial and parallel port connections
on the rear panel. Thanks to this nifty feature, if your computer's serial port doesn't have a
high-speed UART chip, you don't have to upgrade your serial port. Instead, you can connect the
DeskPorte to your PC's parallel port (using an included cable) and load a special driver from
Windows. There is a downside: You won't be able to use your printer unless you have a second
parallel port on your PC.<p>

<i>Practical Peripherals, PRACTICAL CLASS 288 MINITOWER II V.34<b></i><p>

</b>The MiniTower II is a solid external modem from a subsidiary of Hayes. The MiniTower
doesn't
include voice capabilities, but it does have QuickLink II software for fax and data
communications. This one is O.K., but nothing to write home about. <p>

<i>Supra, SUPRA SIMPLE INTERNET</i><p>

Supra Simple Internet was one of two complete Internet packages available for our review. Supra
(owned by Diamond Multimedia) has a reputation for making low-price, high-value modems, and
Supra Simple Internet is no exception. <p>

Supra Simple Internet pretty much has it all, including fax and voice-mail software. But as its
name implies, Internet connectivity is the centerpiece of the package. A CD-ROM contains the 
Mosaic browser. The automatic installation utility shields you from the daunting technical details
of  installing the Web browser and network support software, but the downside is that it connects
you only to Spry/CompuServe for Web access. If  what you crave is easy setup and automatic
access to the Internet at a great price, Supra Simple Internet's a great way to start exploring the
Web.<p>

<p>

<i>U.S. Robotics, SPORTSTER VI FAXMODEM WITH PERSONAL VOICE MAIL<p>

</i>U.S. Robotics is the largest modem maker is the world, and its Sportster line has become the
de
facto standard for low-cost, high-quality modems. The QuickLink Message Center software gives
the Sportster full data, fax, and voice-mail capabilities. Included in the package are NetCruiser
Internet software and a complete 150-page book on exploring the Web.<p>

It consistently connected the first time, every time, and stayed connected at maximum speed. It
costs quite a bit more than its competitors, but its additional features make it well worth the
difference. <p>

<i>Zoom Telephonics, V.34 INTERNET COMPLETE</i><p>

Zoom is one of the world's largest suppliers of low-cost modems. As the name implies, its V.34
Internet Complete is another kit designed to get you traveling on that fabled Information Highway
in short order. Although the internal modem included in the kit has full-fledged data
communications and fax capabilities (no voice mail, though), the only software that comes with
the kit is Internet-related. As with Supra Simple Internet, you need only install the modem and
load the software.<p>

Internet Complete includes the Global Network Navigator (GNN) web browser and connects you
to the Internet through the GNN network, which is a local phone call in most metropolitan areas.
The first 30 days are free; charges after the trial period were being updated at press time. Check
before you give GNN your credit card number.<p>

The Internet Roadmap, a useful 325-page book, is included with Internet Complete. Like Supra
Simple Internet, Zoom's Internet Complete offers an easy and economical way to get connected to
the Internet, but it limits you to using GNN as your Internet service provider. <p>

<i>Prices varying from store to store and from mail order house to mail order house. So shop
before you buy and ask others what they think of the modem they are using. <p>

Also check with your internet provider, they sometimes might have a modem for sale through
them that is known to work well with their setup. </i><p>

<h2>WinFax PRO 7.0 Reviewed</h2>
<hr>
<p>

For Windows 95 users looking for a great way to send, receive, and manage faxes through their
PC, Delrina's WinFax PRO 7.0 is a purchase worth making. Previous WinFax users will be
pleased with the improvements in interface and options, while new users will be surprised with the
functionality and ease of use.<p>

<b>What's New</b><p>

WinFax PRO 7.0 offers many advancements over previous versions of the program. It is Win95
compatible, which brings faster, 32-bit performance. WinFax also utilizes Win95's plug-and-play
capabilities, making installation and connections to other peripherals simple. <p>

WinFax is a total communications solution. No longer is it only a fax program; now it lets you
send and receive E-mail using Win95's Microsoft Exchange (which isn't all that great, but is better
than no email at all).<p>

Delrina's CommBar is a new feature that remains open on your desktop, reporting the status of all
communication events, including fax and E-mail. The CommBar includes icons that give you the
ability to send and receive faxes, view online help, and create a cover page.<p>

A Send Fax Wizard guides you through sending your first faxes, while new halftoning techniques
let you fax gray-scale images. Version 7.0 also lets you move, copy, and delete individual pages
from faxes when viewing them. Xerox's TextBridge 3.0 OCR engine is included with the
program, making it easier to convert a fax image file into text.<p>

You can send recurring faxes, as well. Say, for example, you send a newsletter to the same people
each month. By scheduling a recurring fax and  making the updates to the newsletter file each
month, the fax can be sent automatically. You can schedule WinFax for remote retrieval when
you're away from the office. The software also will forward faxes, notify your pager when a fax is
received, and print confirmation notices after a fax has been sent.<p>

<p>

<i>Faxing Options<p>

</i>The WinFax program includes a toolbar that allows one-button access to send faxes, and a
Phonebook that lets you store the names, addresses, and phone numbers of clients. WinFax lets
you send faxes through the main screen as well as from any Windows application. Simply click on
the Fax icon or select the WinFax printer. Then enter the recipient's name and fax number or
choose the entry from the Phonebook, and the fax will be sent. Faxes can be sent by attaching files
you have created in other applications, too.When sending any fax, you can choose from more than
100 pre-designed cover pages, including special business, cartoon, personal, and general pages. If
none of the pre-designed cover pages suits your taste, you can create your own with WinFax's
Cover Page Designer.<p>

WinFax can be programmed to receive faxes either manually or automatically. In either case, the
CommBar can notify you when a fax has been received. You then can choose what to do: view,
print, save, or delete it. <p>

All faxes are placed in either the Out-box, Receive Log, or Send Log. From these logs, you can
select and view an entire fax at once. With OCR capabilities, you can make additions and changes
to faxes then resend them. If a fax was not transmitted, you can resubmit it. Faxes also can be
held or scheduled for later delivery to save on long distance phone charges or save time when
composing numerous faxes.<p>

Services such as Fax Broadcast and Fax Mailbox let you send the same fax to several people or
create your own private mailbox that receives personal faxes and stores them confidentially.<p>

Turn your computer into a complete phone system with voice mail, fax-on-demand, telephone,
and answering machine functions by purchasing TalkWorks, a $15 addition to WinFax.<p>

By incorporating old winners, like one-button send and a graphical status monitor, with new
features, like the CommBar and TextBridge 3.0, Delrina has developed an award-winning
package for only $75 Delrina also offers a CommSuite package for Windows 95 users. The
package includes WinFax PRO 7.0, WinComm PRO 7.0, CyberJack 7.0 and the TalkWorks
product all in one for a price of about $100. <p>

WinComm PRO acts like the Windows 95 dialer allowing you to conect to BBSs and online
services easily. It also offers FTP, terminal emulations for TelNet and modems. It also features
and image viewers to view files as download them.<p>

CyberJack is an integrated internet package. It lets you browse the web, send and receive e-mail,
FTP files, read news groups, participate in real-time chat plus locate sites by using the "CyberJack
Guidebook"; which comes preloaded with hundreds of web sites, FTP sites, news groups and IRC
chat channels to check out. <p>

<h2><center>EASTER EGGS IN WINDOWS 95</h2>
<hr>
<p>

</center>
Easter  eggs, of course are those hidden developer files found in many programs. An example
would be the cheat codes for Doom that give you full ammo
or life. Here are some new Windows 95 Eggs for your amusement. Most Eggs usually display
credits for the folks who worked on the program. Some
have fancy graphics effects. Some even have sound! I wonder how much wasted disk space if any
these things take up. Might be an interesting cfuture
column.<p>

There are actually two Windows 95 Easter Eggs.  Here's the first one. (Be sure to enter just what
I've put in quotes here, exactly as it is. And remember,
don't type the quotes.) <p>

1. Right-click on the desktop and  choose New and Folder.<p>

2.  Name the folder "and now, the moment you've all been waiting  for".<p>

3. Right-click on the folder and rename it "we proudly present  for your viewing pleasure".<p>

4. Right-click again and rename it "to The Microsoft Windows 95 Product Team!"<p>

   Now double-click on the folder  to see the   Egg.<p>

If that doesn't work, try this method: name the folder "Anything. {986DADA0-42A0- 1069-
A2E7-08002B30309D}". If that doesn't work, you just can't
see the Egg on your computer. Some folks report this is so.<p>

The  other Egg in Windows 95, one that's lesser known and harder to see 
can be found by trying the
following: When the mouse pointer first appears as
Windows 95 is starting (the screen should be black at this point), press these keys in order:
Ctrl+F6+Right Shift+ Del+ Right Mouse Button.<p>

What you see, if you can get this to work, is Bill Gates's horse, Nugget, in full color.       <p>

<h2><b>In Search of Merlin</b></h2>
<p>

Well, it looks like IBM decided to change the way that it handles Beta testing. The first beta of
"Merlin", the next
release of OS/2 Warp, is a controlled "closed" beta. This means that you fill out an application
form and IBM
decides whether you are qualified to beta test it. If you are, you will receive the beta. If not, you
receive nothing.
This is not unusual in the computer industry. The second beta, which should happen about four
weeks later, will
be an "open" beta, where you can call an 800-number and for about $15, IBM will ship it to you. 
<p>

<p>

Qualified testers should receive the first beta about the time this article shows up at your local
computer store.
If you haven't already signed up for the beta, feel free to start your journey at
<a href="http://www.cincyteamos2.org/">"http://www.cincyteamos2.org/"</a>
where you can find the link to sign up for it. Make sure you read all the instructions and fill out
the form
completely.<p>

<p>

If you plan on testing the Voicetype Dictation features in Merlin, you will need a special type of
noise canceling
microphone. The details on the microphone are listed at the site where you sign up for the
beta.<p>

<p>

If you are a tester, be sure you do your best, and report everything to IBM as soon as possible.

<h2>Browser Wars Heat Up</h2>
<p>

Not too long ago, a browser was just someone who hung around a newsstand or bookstore without buying
anything. Now, thanks to the World Wide Web and the explosion of Web technology on corporate networks,
the browser has turned into a pretty indispensable piece of software used by millions daily.<p>

<p>

Netscape Navigator owns 70 percent of the Internet browser market, but Microsoft's Internet Explorer is
closing in fast. Each has a free, downloadable version available for a trial period. So which one should you
use? In my humble opinion, most likely you need both. This is mainly due to the different features that each
browser has to offer.  <p>

<p>

Netscape 2.0's open-ended plug-in structure allows developers to create interactive embellishments that bring
the Web to life. Support for the Java programming language, for instance, lets you view dynamic visual and
audio elements - like talking clocks and animated cartoon characters. And now, inline plug-ins like media
players, filters, and other applications can be seamlessly integrated directly into the browser. For example, the
Adobe Acrobat plug-in lets you view graphically rich pages that reflect precise font and image control. So
when you read an online newspaper it will look just like the hard copy.<p>

<p>

Frames are another new feature of version 2.0. They allow developers to create pages displaying multiple and
independently scrollable frames on a single screen. This lets you freeze an element, like a site's table of
contents, and keep it on your screen as you burrow down. For an example, check out the Atlantic Records
site (WWW. ATLANTIC-RECORDS.COM/). Finally, Netscape 2.0 is platform independent - it runs on
Windows 95, Windows 3.x, Mac OS, and UNIX.<p>

<p>

Microsoft's Internet Explorer, on the other hand, requires Windows 95. It's downloadable for free at
Microsoft's home page, WWW.MICROSOFT.COM, and available on the Plus Pack for Windows 95. This
Mosaic-based browser supports all of the standard hypertext functions, including tables.<p>

 <p>

One of Internet Explorer's strengths is the ease-of-use afforded by its  integration with Windows 95. Once
you've configured Win 95 with your Internet provider or set up your Microsoft Network account, just click
on the Internet Explorer icon, and you're ready to begin surfing the Web. <p>

<p>

Internet Explorer's Win 95 integration is also revealed in the browser's novel approach to bookmarks. Your
favorite sites are stored as shortcuts in standard Win 95 folders, which means that you can manipulate them
with Win 95's basic file operation utilities (copy, move, delete, rename, and so on). It uses the standard Win
95 video player, and ships with Real Audio, a sound player that lets you listen to streamed audio built into
Web pages. You can easily add audio to your site and also scrolling marquee of multi-colored text. Check
out the magazine's site at http://www.albany.net/~tricity/mast.html for a look at the background music and
scrolling marquee features.<p>

<p>

While Netscape's open-ended structure for multimedia and other enhancements will let you view fancy
embellishments as they appear, Internet Explorer will also get you around the Net in style. It offers
tremendous functionality from its tight integration with Windows 95.<p>

<p>

Netscape Navigator 3.0, with commercial release scheduled for July, is an incremental improvement on the
already very good 2.0 version. Internet Explorer 3.0, which should be released in late summer, is a huge leap
from Microsoft's current model.<p>

<p>

Planned changes to the new browsers include feature like CoolTalk, which allows voice conversations, typed
chat, and the sharing of ``white-board'' screens. These screens let people take turns making changes in a
drawing or in text while others watch. Netscape has also added a security feature called digital signatures that
automatically identifies you to servers, a crucial step for business transactions on the Net. The new browser
runs faster, has improved multimedia abilities, and is much more efficient at running network applications
written in Sun Microsystems' Java language.<p>

<p>

Microsoft's current Internet Explorer 2.0 lacks many of the features of even Netscape's Navigator 2.0, such
as the ability to split a screen into multiple, independent ``frames.'' The new version, however, matches
Netscape 3.0 feature for feature--then adds a few of its own. Its basic screen setup, which will instantly feel
comfortable to Windows 95 users, is very flexible, allowing you to customize, resize, and move tool bars and
menus. In addition to voice, chat, and white-board sharing, Microsoft NetMeeting lets two or more people
on the Internet work together in a Windows application, such as Microsoft Word or Lotus 1-2-3. And
Internet Explorer has a built-in feature that allows parents to cut off kids' access to undesirable sites.<p>

<p>

The stage is now set for a major battle for your desktop between Netscape and Microsoft. Netscape, which
sells primarily to companies, thinks that corporate systems departments will favor Navigator because it offers
less reliance on Microsoft and because it works more or less identically on a variety of systems, including
Windows, Macintosh, and UNIX.  What they might not realize is that most of these corporate systems
departments are already quite reliant on Microsoft for most of their operating system needs.<p>

<p>

Netscape says that it has no intention of supporting ActiveX and believes the whole market is moving toward
Java. I think it is more that they hope the whole market is moving towards Java.<p>

<p>

Microsoft, which is giving its browser away, is appealing directly to end users, whether in the home or in
Corporate America. It also has struck deals to make its latest Internet Explorer the browser of choice on both
America Online and CompuServe. And by the end of the year, Microsoft will release a new version of Win95
and Windows NT, code-named Nashville, that will make Internet Explorer part of the Windows desktop. Of
course, Netscape is betting that you'll prefer Navigator anyway. But if Microsoft can deliver on its promises
in timely fashion--always a big if--I'm not sure you'll see any need to go beyond Internet Explorer.<p>

<p>

Netscape Navigator 2.0 (and the beta 3.0 when available) can be downloaded from
http://www.home.netscape.com A commercial version is available for $49 (free 90-day trial) / Netscape,
415-528-2555<p>

<p>

Internet Explorer 2.0 Downloadable free from http://www.microsoft.com or available in Plus Pack ($40)

<h2>Animate the Web</h2>
<h3>By Bill Franklin</h3>
If you've ever tried to add any multimedia to your web site then you know there's a serious
problem with online
multimedia: It's too darn big to work decently with given the speed of a 28.8-kbps modem. But,
there is a
solution to this delima; CelAnimator 1.0 from FutureWave lets you build interactive, animated
graphics that won't
make Web surfers grind their teeth while fat bitmaps crawl across the wire slower than my aunt
Tilly drives her
car to the market.<p>

As its name implies, CelAnimator builds cartoonlike animation, using compact, vector-based
graphics that permit
swift downloads and sharp images.Animations get down to 15K and hover under 100K in many
cases. Web
surfers can view CelAnimator elements by installing a royalty-free Netscape Navigator
plug-in.<p>

CelAnimator comes with everything you need to create vector drawings, add basic text, and edit
scenes. A simple
drag-and-drop interface is augmented by a series of effective step-by-step tutorials that let you
practice creating
animation, managing layers, and so on. You orchestrate animated scenes by using a frame-based,
time line
interface similar to the ones found in video editing packages. To create a new scene, you draw or
import graphic
objects, create motion paths, and set beginning and end points. Key frames, rotation controls, and
other options
provide further detail, and multiple layers help you manage your work. You can import from
other vector formats
(such as WMF, EPS, and DXF), but not from CorelDraw's proprietary CDR format.<p>

With its compact files and streaming graphics, CelAnimator seems particularly well suited for logo
animation and
button customization. For example, you can create buttons that appear to squish when
pressed--without adding
by significantly to the size of your HTML page. Anti-aliasing eliminates jaggies, while support for
hot spots lets
you reward users with an animation when they click on a spot. <p>

Of course, FutureWave is not the only company to take advantage of vector graphics.
Micrografx, for instance,
offers QuickSilver, a plug-in for Navigator that also lets you view fast vector graphics on the
Web; but you must
use the company's ABC GraphicsSuite as the creation tool. So while<p>

CelAnimator can't create immersive 3-D worlds, won't support audio, and does require a plug-in,
it delivers
refreshing interactivity without annoying delays--on its own. <p>

CelAnimator 1.0 WIN 95, NT, MAC<p>

<h2>America Online Settles Suits Over Billing Practices</b></h2>
<h3>By Tony Ardito</h3>
<p>
<hr>
America Online Inc. will give away millions of hours of on-line time to some subscribers to settle a 11
class-action suits against America Online for alleged improper billing practices. <p>

<p>

Max W. Berger of New York and other lawyers representing America Online customers said that the settlement
had received preliminary approval by the San Francisco Superior Court.  Final approval is expected after America
Online customers are notified and a public hearing is held in San Francisco. <p>

<p>

Customers of America Online between July 15, 1991 and March 31, 1996, may be eligible to receive some free
on-line time or cash compensation. But, Berger said, it will be mainly heavy users of the service during that time
who will benefit the most. <p>

<p>

Anyone using America Online for five hours or less pays the monthly minimum charge of $9.95. Only customers
charged more than the minimum amount, Berger explained, qualify as members of the "overcharged" class. <p>

<p>

Industry analysts estimate that 60 percent of America Online's 5 million subscribers use the service for less than
five hours a month.  <p>

<p>

Under the settlement, all members of the affected class who are America Online subscribers when the free time
is given out will receive one free hour of on-line time. In addition, subscribers who paid the company more than
$300 during the time covered by the settlement will receive additional free time. <p>

<p>

Former subscribers who paid at least $300 in the settlement period will be eligible for cash compensation; but
must contact AOL for details. The total payout by America Online as part of the cash settlement process will not
exceed $500,000. <p>

<p>

The litigation covered a number of practices by America Online. But the plaintiffs' lawyers said the core of their
case was the practice of adding 15 seconds to customers' on-line time for the purposes of billing, and also
rounding up to the next minute. <p>

<p>

For example, Berger said, 46 seconds of time spent connected to the service would be a minute and one second,
after adding the 15 seconds. Then, the minute and one second would be rounded up to two minutes. <p>

<p>

"A company can charge whatever it wants," Berger said. "But the heart of our case was that there was
insufficient disclosure." <p>

<h2>Back up Your Hard Drive Or Suffer the Consequensus</h2>
<h3>By Edward Lansing </h3>
<p>

Lesson One - Back up your hard drive. Lesson 2 - Back up your hard drive. 
Lesson 3 - I didn't back up my hard drive and it crashed. It's age-old sage advice: Back up your computer's
hard drive. Yet few PC owners do, possibly because it takes too much 
effort, or perhaps because it requires an investment in additional hardware and software. But now a new star appears on the horizon and
those of you who have been putting it off have run out of excuses because several new World Wide Web-
based services are making backup a nearly effortless task -- at a cost of course. <p>

<p>

DataSafe of Framingham, MA., SureFind in Pittsburgh, PA., and McAfee Personal Vault from McAfee in
Santa Clara, Calif., are services that use on-line connections to back up and restore data to a hard drive,
automatically at pre-scheduled intervals. All are available now. A fourth service, the HotWire Internet
Backup Service of Allentown, PA., will enter their beta test phase within the next few weeks. <p>

<p>

Despite their simplicity, none of the available services is inexpensive compared with some PC peripherals. For
example, some devices for backing up hard drives -- including Iomega Corporation's Zip and Ditto drives --
and their media can be bought once for less than $300. Personal Vault, DataSafe and Surefind can cost from
$120 to almost $700 a year, depending on the kind of service purchased. <p>

<p>

Using these services could be a time consuming affair, as well, because of bandwidth constraints. Files from a
computer's hard drive are sent to, or received from, these services at the speed of your PC's modem.
Normally, a standard 14.4 kbps modem transmits data at the rate of 4.5 megabytes an hour. If you transfer
your data for backup in this manner I suggest investing in a 28.8kps modem.<p>

<p>

Almost anything can trigger a problem that will lead to serious regret if you haven't backed up the important
data in your computer: a virus, a hard disk  crash, even switching a Microsoft Windows 95-based PC off
before the operating system has had a chance to shut down properly. That last scenario will cause a
catastrophic change in a file known as the Master Boot Record, and the only solution might be reformatting
the hard drive and reloading all applications from scratch -- minus data files if you haven't backed them up. <p>

<p>

<b>DataSafe </b><p>

<p>

DataSafe, which officially debuted on July 8, makes backing up a hard drive nearly automatic. After an initial
setup process in which the user sets a schedule and picks an encryption password, the DataSafe software will
compress and encrypt the data, then dial in to hard-drive arrays maintained by Connected (DataSafe's parent
company), either through the World Wide Web or directly through a telephone number that is part of
CompuServe's network. <p>

<p>

Later, at intervals set by the user, the software scans the PC's hard drive, determines which pieces of files
have changed, then sends only those fragments to the storage centers.  The DataSafe software will
automatically distinguish between data and applications.  <p>

<p>

The DataSafe software is available for free for Windows 95 and 3.1 now. A version for Apple Macintosh
computers is expected to be released in August. <p>

<p>

For the first 30 days the service is free, too, and users can back up as much as 30 megabytes of
uncompressed data. After the free period, a charge of $14.95 a month buys the right to upload 15 more
megabytes of new or changed uncompressed data each month. <p>

<p>

Backing up additional data during the first paid month costs 25 cents per megabyte. In subsequent months,
backups of additional data cost $1.50 per megabyte.  Another plan, for $19.95 a month, allows incremental
backups of 20 megabytes per month, and a $24.95 plan permits backups of 25 megabytes per month. <p>

<p>

Restoring data is included in the base monthly charge, but for an additional $24.95, Connected will create an
archival CD-ROM that contains every version of every file it has stored. 
There are two advantages to buying the disk. First, it would be faster to retrieve very old files from the CD-ROM than via modem. Second, "you
can feel confident about cleaning your hard drive." <p>

<p>

To be safe, all data the service receives is stored at two "mirrored" sites at different locations around the
country. Therefore, if data is somehow lost at one site it can be accessed at the other. <p>

<p>

To add to the service's convenience, Connected will allow any user to authorize that the stored data be
shared with other DataSafe users, with colleagues, or with a computer that didn't send the data. In the last
scenario, a user might back up a desktop computer but access the stored data with a portable computer.  <p>

<p>

Connected also is planning to add additional services to its basic offering. Three or four will be added within
the next six months. The first will be virus protection. Others will include application fixes and driver
updates. The additional services are expected to cost nominally more.  <p>

<p>

<b>SureFind </b><p>

<p>

In principlet, SureFind is identical to DataSafe, but there are a few substantial differences that set this service
apart. One is that after the initial backup of 100 megabytes of data, 
SureFind backs up completely any files that have changed, not just fragments of files. Also, data sent to SureFind is stored on optical discs, not
hard drives, and at only one location. (As an extra precaution, SureFind 
backs up the data from the optical disks to tapes.)  <p>

<p>

However, SureFind, does not allow users to back up data through the Internet. Only a direct-dial linkup
through CompuServe's network is available.  SureFind can cost much more than DataSafe. Although a basic
subscription costs only $9.95 a month, it permits backups only once a week, and only up to five megabytes
per backup. A midrange plan costs $24.95 a month and allows three backups a week. Backing up five times
will cost $54.95 per month. Both extra storage beyond five megabytes and 
data recovery cost 50 cents per megabyte. Moreover, a $5 minimum applies to all data recoveries. Only the most expensive plan includes one
recovery per month at no additional cost.  <p>

<p>

Whereas DataSafe uses 56-bit key DES encryption, SureFind uses the slightly less robust 40-bit key DES
technology.  And unlike DataSafe, SureFind offers no mechanism for a user to allow anyone else to access
his or her data, or for the user to access it from more than one registered computer.  Finally, SureFind had no
plans to offer a version of its software for Macintosh computers.  <p>

<p>

Backups through the Internet will probably be offered within the next 60 days, he said, and next fall the
company will offer backup service for Novell and Windows NT network servers. <p>

<p>

<b>McAfee Personal Vault </b><p>

<p>

McAfee Personal Vault, a third on-line data backup and retrieval service, is similar in many ways to both
DataSafe and SureFind, but different in one key way: the service requires users to purchase McAfee's
WebStor program, a backup utility, for about $50 retail. <p>

<p>

Like DataSafe, the Personal Vault service stores backed up data on hard drive arrays known as "RAID
storage subsystems." And like SureFind, it backs up the backups to tape. The price of the service is $10 a
month or $120 per year, including 10 megabytes of storage and an 
unlimited number of recoveries at no additional charge. <p>

<p>

The only problem I see with backing up your files in this manner would really have to do with what type of a
server your internet provider is using. If it is a secure server then sending your files via modem should be OK
and hopefully noone will be able to hack into the copy or tamper with them. If your provider is using an
unsecure server then I would be very hesitant to send my company's data over modem for backup.<p>

<h2>Will Cable Reign In Your Future?</h2>
<p>

Even though it seems that for some folks the Internet has taken a front seat over TV these days; offering
mountains of information just for the surfing, the cables companies have not yet rolled over and played dead. In
fact, the Internet seems to have given cable companies their first breakthrough product in more than a decade:
the cable modem. Cable subscribers across the country will get a taste of truly high-speed access to the World
Wide Web by the end of 1996. On average, a cable modem will transmit data downstream to a home user's PC
at 10 mbps--dramatically faster than today's average modem speed of 14.4 kbps and ISDN connections at 128
kbps.<p>

<p>

Numerous manufacturers have lined up to provide these modems, including  Motorola, Hewlett-Packard,
Scientific-Atlanta, 3Com, Zenith Electronics, Cisco Systems, and General Instrument. An equally impressive
roster of companies (including Time Warner and TCI ) want you to engage them as your service provider to
bring content to a PC near you.<p>

<p>

How soon will these high-speed connections reach your neighborhood? The answer depends on how quickly the
cable industry can overcome the infrastructure obstacles, such as upgrading cable networks for two-way
communication. Industry estimates vary, but the latest figures from modem manufacturers state that between 5
and 10 percent of the nation's cable lines can support the upload (or return path) of digital data through the cable
modem at an average speed of 768 kbps (which is about one- tenth the speed of the download). His is still
extremely fast when compared to our current 28.8 kbps modems or even 128kbps ISDN lines.<p>

<p>

Many current modem models can be configured to send information upstream through a phone line, albeit at a
much slower rate that places the connection at the same pace as today's existing 14.4-kbps and 28.8-kbps speeds.
But recent deregulation in the industry and passage of the federal Telecommunications Act in February have only
added to the competition between  the Baby Bells and the cable companies, making this format an unattractive
prospect.<p>

<p>

The last thing cable companies want to do is give phone companies more business. Instead, they plan to roll out
their services at the same rate they upgrade their networks. According to Lewis, the average cost of upgrading
cable plants to handle two-way communication is about $75 per subscriber, which explains why cable giant Continental Cablevision has budgeted about $50 million this year to bring its
Internet service to market. Continental hopes to have 20,000 paying subscribers within a year of launch.<p>

<p>

Unlike today's Internet access providers--which act strictly as gateways to allow you access to third-party
content, cable companies plan to offer a host of services aside from connections to the Internet, taking an
approach similar to online services such as America Online and CompuServe. When Time Warner launches its
service later this year in San Diego, Akron, and Elmira, New York, it will include dedicated local content,
shopping, Internet access, and school and government information, along with specialty content that takes
advantage of the high-speed connection.<p>

<p>

What's the cost of all this great new service? When the services become available, pricing for consumers will
initially follow the model set when cable set-top boxes were first offered. Consumers will probably pay between
$30 and $40 per month to rent the cable modem and access the Internet and online services, with higher fees for
premium content. To gain widespread acceptance, cable companies will at first subsidize the roughly
$500-per-modem cost. Cable companies do not plan to eat these costs forever, though, and they realize that
long-term profits depend on bringing these modems to the retail channel for consumers to buy, as they would
other peripherals.<p>

<p>

Industry sources say that the cable modems will be available for purchase in about two-three years The main
obstacle to creating a mass market for cable modems is that as yet there is no agreement as to standards for the
modems and for the equipment on the cable company end that will link to PCS. Two groups are tackling this
issue. One includes Motorola and six of the top cable companies in the country. Hewlett-Packard, Intel, former
AT&amp;T unit Lucent Technologies, and Hybrid Networks have consolidated into a competing camp.<p>

<p>

On the other side<p>

<p>

Cable modems may be the equipment of the future (according to the cable companies of course), but the nation's
local phone giants want to grab you as a customer today, before the cable companies jump into the fray.
Although integrated services digital network (ISDN) technology has been available for years, the phone
companies have just begun to emphasize it in the last few months, lowering monthly access charges and
advertising the services like they were the best thing since sliced bread.<p>

<p>

Major Bells such as Pacific Bell and Bell Atlantic are now offering Internet connections at regular modem speeds
and at the ISDN rate of 128 kbps, but their push may be a case of too little too late. With cable modems on the horizon promising much faster access rates, market research firm International Data Corp. estimates that the
window of opportunity for ISDN before cable modems begin devouring the market may be as brief as two years.<p>

<p>

Another technology, asymmetrical digital subscriber line (ADSL), may hold greater promise for phone companies
as cable modems begin to appear. ADSL transmits data through a regular phone line downstream at 6.144 mbps
and upstream at 640 kbps, which makes the technology more competitive with its cable counterpart. Companies
such as GTE and US West have run ADSL trials delivering multimedia content to homes, but the technology
remains expensive,  and phone companies may have a hard time bringing 
ADSL to market as a product before going head to head with cable modems.<p>

<p>

Regardless of the outcome, users can expect a number of high-bandwidth options to help deliver rich multimedia
content to the desktop.  And, you can be sure that very soon you'll be getting those annoying calls at dinner
asking which internet provider/cable company you're using. <p>

<h2>Memory Prices Still Dropping</b></h2>
<p>

Do you have a fast CPU, fast video card, and fast CD-ROM drive, but slow Windows? Sound
impossible? Well,
that's just what you have if your system doesn't have enough memory. For example, if you're
running Windows
3.x, you should have at least 8MB of RAM, and if you've upgraded to Windows 95, you should
really have
16MB of RAM.<p>

<p>

Increased memory does more than just speed up Windows' performance: It also lets you keep
more applications
open simultaneously, as well as load larger and more complex files. This will improve everything
you do with
your computer, not just the work-related activities.<p>

<p>

Installing RAM yourself is literally a snap, and with prices at just around $10-12 per megabyte
(compared with
$50 a year ago), there's no reason to avoid this simple upgrade. The hardest part is determining
what type of
memory to get for your system. Your computer probably uses single in-line memory modules
(SIMMs), but you'll
need to know more than that. To find out exactly what kind of RAM your system uses, look at
the owner's
manual that came with your computer, call your computer vendor, or call the technical support
number of your
manufacturer. Most of today's PC's are using 72pin SIMMs, though there are still some around
(like mine) that
use the older, and more expensive, 30 pin SIMMs. The cost of the 30 pin SIMMs has not
dropped as
dramactically as that of the 72 pin because 30 pin SIMMs are not being mass produced anymore.
So, they are still
siting around $90-100 for 4mb's. <p>

<p>

Remember to shop around a bit for the best price on the SIMMs - the cost will fluctuate a bit
from store to store. <p>

<h2>MOUSE TALES: A column about the Macintosh</h2>
</b><h3></b>By George Herman<b></h3>
<b><p>

</b>BANG! CRASH!<p>

<p>

Well, that is an exaggeration. When a computer "crashes" it makes no noise at all - it just declares its absolute
independence and refuses to obey any instructions, from mouse, keyboard, or whatever. The Macintosh may
display an unwelcome alert message decorated with a picture of a round bomb, to let the user know that the Mac
has "bombed out." Or - and for me at least, this has become more likely in System 7.5 - it may just quietly  freeze,
so that the mouse does not move the cursor, keyboard commands do nothing, and even the keyboard shutdown
key has no effect at all when pressed.  <p>

<p>

This is one of the things the salesman doesn't mention, nor do the computer enthusiasts who are recruiting new
users among their friends. But the crash is part of living with a computer - any computer. Bill Husted, a columnist
for the Denver Post, discussing loyalty among Mac versus Windows fans in his April 6, 1996 column, said, As
far as operating systems, Windows 95 is still likely to lock up or crash once or twice a week. My Macintosh,
running System 7.5.3, has about the same record. In fact, you have to be grateful that neither is powering a
heart-lung machine. When I first installed System 7.5 on my nice new Power Mac it was crashing  so often that
my wife said, I'm glad you got a new computer, but why didn't you get one that works? Eventually I found the
culprit, an extension that conflicted with other extensions, and life was much more predictable - but not
absolutely crash free!<p>

<p>

The bomb alert box provides a Restart button, with the black outline that tells you it will respond to the keyboard
Return key as well as a mouse click. Most of the time, this gets the computer back in business. But when the
device freezes, no announcement is made. <p>

<p>

It is sometimes possible to get a frozen Mac gracefully back into normal operation by forcing the frozen
application to quit. A forced quit is managed from the keyboard, so it does not matter if the Mac is not
responding to the mouse. The command is given by holding down both the Option and the Command key and
pressing Escape (esc). Sometimes that will get the frozen application out of the way and the Mac back to normal,
but remember that sometimes.<p>

<p>

The only  sure way to regain control is to turn the computer off at the switch, wait a few seconds, and turn it on
again. In System 7.5 this restart brings up an alert box that says "This computer may not have been properly shut
down..." which makes me want to answer, "Did you think I hadnt noticed?" <p>

<p>

Once having recovered control by restarting, it is a good idea to check out the hard disk with either Apples Disk
First Aid or the Norton Utilities. Occasionally this will reveal a need to repair the organization of the disk, which
either program will do for you if you let it. It is also a good idea to save work in a word processor, graphics
program, or spreadsheet at frequent intervals while working. Then if there is a crash, the only work lost is that
completed since the last save!<p>

<p>

Why not make a computer that  doesnt crash? Thats easier to say than to do. As computers and software
become more complex, the likelihood of bugs not known before release to market increases. In software, the
response to this is a new version, in which those bugs have been eliminated - but new ones may lie hidden. Some
varieties of software seem to be especially prone to bugs not found in the design and devlopment process. World
Wide Web browsers more often contain bugs that freeze the machine than word processors, for example.  The
solution is to try a different browser or wait for version 2.<p>

<p>

The Macintosh is designed to allow the user to customize its operation easily, among other things by adding 
extensions to the system folder. This creates a possible source of system crashes. Extensions are additions to the
basic operating system software that expand the capacities of the computer beyond its original system design.
Many  identify themselves at startup by displaying an icon at the bottom of the screen. Some were installed when
you (or somebody) installed the system folder in your computer. Some you may have added since then.
Unfortunately, it is possible to add an extension which cannot live in peace with one that is already there. Then
they fight and the Macintosh loses the fight. If there is some operation that often causes the Mac to crash, you
can test the possibility that this is caused by coflicting extensions by starting up with all extensions disabled. At
startup, or after choosing Restart from the Special menu, hold down the Shift key until you see the box that
announces "Welcome to Macintosh. Extensions off." If that cures the Mac of its tendency to crash, you know
an extension is the villain. Now you have to figure out which one. <p>

<p>

There is a nice package on the market called Conflict Catcher which helps greatly with this task. For a while, at
least, Apple was including it free with every purchase of System 7.5. Does that say any thing about their
confidence in the stability of the new system? If you do not have Conflict Catcher but are using system 7.5 the
Extensions Manager control panel allows extensions to be enabled or disbaled one at a time until the culprit is
found. Since extensions are loaded at startup, the computer must be restarted to make such changes effective.<p>

<p>

Tracking down the sources of system crashes is too complicated a subject to be covered in a single column. There
are good books on using the Mac that tell more, but an experienced friend or a user group are the best tools
available! The chief lesson of this column is - don't panic. Crashing is a part of the normal life of the computer.
It does not mean the computer has died - only that it needs treatment.<p>

<h2>UPDATE YOUR SOFTWARE WHILE YOU SLEEP</h2>
<p>

Juat like cars, to run properly, personal computers demand a bit of maintenance and a periodic tuneup. An
increasingly confusing problem for PC owners is keeping up with the free updates, or ``patches,'' that
software makers issue for their programs. Even if you have painstakingly registered every program  with the
manufacturer, you can still miss an update because a software maker may not have the resources to send free
fixes to everyone. CyberMedia Inc., a software maker in Santa Monica, Calif., says it has a way to help PC
owners keep their software in top form by getting updates via the Internet.<p>

<p>

The company is working on a program called Oil Change for IBM-compatible PCs. The $70 program will
scan a PC's hard drive for the version number and revision dates of every piece of software it finds. It will
then automatically compare that data to the information in its master database and alert the owner when an
update or patch is needed. If the owner wants Oil Change to make the fixes, the program will dial into the
appropriate software maker's Web site and get the appropriate free updates. What's more, since the program
can dial into the Internet, Oil Change also automatically updates itself, pulling the latest list of software
patches from CyberMedia's own Web site. Oil Change should be available by September.<p>

<p>

Editor's Note: While this may sound like an interesting program I for one have to be a bit worried about my
computer connecting with other computers on it's own. We will have to wait and see how secure such a
program is before we could recommend it to our readers.<p>

<h2>Technology News and Industry Updates</h2>
<p>

<b>New Digital Camera Ships:</b> ACS Innovations will next week ship a $250 digital color camera that the company
hopes will take a slice of the videoconferencing and image-capture market that Connectix Color QuickCam now
dominates.  The Compro Digital Color Internet Camera can be used either for videoconferencing or capturing
images without the use of a separate card or power supply. The camera can capture a still image with a resolution
of 640 by 480 pixels at 16.8 million colors. Motion video can be captured at 160 by 120 pixels. <p>

<p>

The Internet Camera package includes a camera head and adjustable stand, parallel port pass-through interface,
and a drivers for existing videoconferencing and image rendering programs that support AVI and TWAIN
interfaces.<p>

<p>

<b>Apple Polishes its Color Mac Printer:</b> Apple's new Color StyleWriter 2500 is not only faster than the model
2400 it replaces, but it offers better print quality, costs about $40 less, and throws in roughly $150 worth of
popular software for creating color documents. <p>

<p>

The printer, which works only with Macintosh computers, is literally a snap to set up: Just push the color print
cartridge into place. The unit, which measures about 8 inches high by 14 inches wide by 9 inches deep, offers
color reproduction of 720 by 360 dots per inch--the 2400 printedcolor at only 360 by 360 dpi. The new model's
tray accepts 100 sheets of plain paper, 50 sheets of coated paper, 20 transparencies or 15 envelopes.<p>

<p>

On the downside, te Color StyleWriter 2500's speed is only 5 pages per minute in black and white and two-thirds
of a page per minute in color. The new model conserves energy, shutting down when idle, then restarting
automatically when you hit the Print command.<p>

<p>

Color StyleWriter 2500 buyers also get a bonus CD-ROM featuring Mindscape's Cardshop Plus!, StickerShop
Plus!, Calendars and other programs that put the printer to good use, plus 12 extra TrueType fonts to expand
on the 64 that come with the machine. $379 (Macintosh) from Apple Computer, (800) 776-2333, (408)
996-1010, http://www.apple.com. <p>

<p>

<b>MSNBC Loses Identity for a Day:</b> Somebody at MSNBC forgot to tell InterNIC, the organization that
oversees the registration of domain names, that the check was in the mail. <p>

<p>

Last week, InterNIC announced that they would block access to sites that hadn't paid the $100 domain name
registration fee. They made good on their threat by blocking access to the MSNBC site all day on July 7th, when
the a joint venture between Microsoft and NBC was set to preview its site. No word on who shelled out  the
money, but the site is back online.<p>

<p>

<b>America's Online Job Bank Continues Growth:</b> Secretary Robert Reich yesterday issued a challenge to
America's major corporations to put their job openings where the people are -- the Internet and the Labor
Department's online Job Bank. Reich made his challenge as he officially opened the Joint Employment and
Training Technology Conference (JETT*CON), the first ever technology conference focused on workforce
development. By Bill Pietrucha. US Labor, July 10th, 1996. The Labor Secretary also announced that IBM has
become the first major US corporation to post its job openings -- some 24,000 listings each year -- on "America's
Job Bank."<p>

<p>

America's Job Bank joined the Internet in February, 1995, with just 78,000 jobs posted, Reich said, and has now
grown to more than 500,000 job listings. Most of the jobs listed on the bank at http://www.ajb.dni.us are
full-time listings, and approximately 95 percent are in the private sector, Reich said. <p>

"America's Job Bank is hot, hot, hot," Reich said in his opening remarks. "It's one of the Internet's most visited
sites, with more than six million hits a month." The job listing service is a free service that links employers to job
seekers. It collects, connects, and continuously updates job openings from 1,800 nationwide employment service
offices and from private companies which enter openings directly on the job bank. The bank also links to 80
private placement agencies and directly links to openings on corporate home pages.<p>

<p>

Each job listing on the job bank, created and financed by the Department of Labor's Employment and Training
Administration, contains: a brief job description; salary information; education, skill and experience requirements;
and the city and state where the job is located. Press Contact: Nancy Coffey, US Department of Labor,

<b>PC Stats:</b> People of all ages are getting tangled in the Web, but the median age of users on the Internet is 34.
The Gender gap: In a recent technology poll, 4 out of 10 men surveyed owned a PC, while only 1 out of 4
women owned one. Of those surveyed at a recent Smithsonian exhibit in Los Angeles who were born before
1971, more than 60 percent believe the computer will be the most important device in their lives by the year
2000-- above TVs, cars, and telephones.<p>

<b>Apple Polishing:</b> Macintosh owners waiting for Copland, the long-delayed overhaul of the Mac operating
system, may get a small break. Apple Computer Inc. now plans to release one last upgrade to its 5-year-old
System 7 late this year. The new version, code-named Harmony, will integrate an assortment of bits and pieces
that Apple has released, including improved networking and Internet tools, as well as some Copland features.
Copland, the first version of Mac OS designed specifically for the PowerPC chip, isn't slated to ship until late '97.<p>

<b>Coming To A Walmart Near You: </b>The Canadian equivalent of Kinko's is teaming up with Wal-Mart
Supercenters to open graphics and communications centers at outlets of the all-American discount chain. Le Print
Express International plans to offer services including duplicating, binding, laminating, and printing at Wal-Mart
stores throughout the United States. <p>

<p>

The first of eight centers scheduled for this year opened today in Lubbock, Texas, with 100 more planned by the
end of 1997. "Wal-Mart is well positioned geographically in terms of our goals and objectives," said Roy
Whiston, president of Le Print Express. "They are a very well established organization with an excellent
reputation." <p>

<p>

The purpose of providing this type of service in Wal-Mart stores is to reach out to the growing number of home
businesses, Whiston added. "Home-based businesses are very difficult to locate because they are not listed in the
yellow pages under H, and it seems very logical that a lot of home-based business people would be shopping at
Wal-Mart," he said.<p>

<p>

<b>Hotel Postcards Give Way to Email:</b> In planes, you get free peanuts. With rental cars, maybe an upgrade to
a convertible. Now, in a sign of our newly digitized times, frequent stays at Marriott Hotels, Resorts, and Suites
will net you free email.  Acknowledging that any high-powered business person worth their cellular phone now
has to have email, Marriott Hotels has added free email accounts to its list of bonuses awarded to members in
its Honored Guests Awards and Marriott Miles programs. <p>

<p>

The deal comes from a cross-promotional agreement announced today by the hotel chain and Juno, a free Internet
email service funded by advertising. The service is available to anyone who signs up for it, but the agreement
means that Marriott will be promoted to members through interactive advertisements on the Juno service. Users
are required to indicate their interests and provide demographic information when signing up, information studied
by advertisers to target consumers. <p>

<p>

<b>Microsoft In Love Hate Relationship With Java:</b> The company, which first announced plans for the tool in
March, initially gave Java the cold shoulder when Sun Microsystems introduced it to the Internet last year. Since
then, Microsoft has gone through a wholesale conversion to Java, developing a souped-up engine called a
just-in-time compiler that will be incorporated into its Internet Explorer browser and, later this year, Windows
itself. The company has also attempted to position Java as a partner for, not a competitor to, its ActiveX Internet
framework.<p>

<p>

With Visual J++, formerly code-named Jakarta, Microsoft intends to cover all its bases by providing tools for
the growing community of Java developers. The product will pit the company directly against Borland
International, Symantec, and SunSoft, all of which are working on or have released their own Java development
tools.<p>

<p>

Microsoft, however, hopes to distinguish its tool by providing developers with facilities for linking applets and
ActiveX components. The company is also working with Sun to improve the language, though it denied that it
would extend Java in ways that would be proprietary to Windows.<p>

<p>

During beta testing, Visual J++ will be available for free downloading.  Pricing has not been announced for the
final version of the product, which will ship in the fall. Http://www.ms.com/<p>

<b>Excite Merges With Magellan: </b>The merger between the companies that own Internet directories Excite and
Magellan is a likely harbinger of an anticipated shakeout in the cluttered search engine market. <p>

<p>

Many financial analysts believe that the market for advertising-supported search engine sites is too crowded and
the services too difficult to differentiate to support more than a handful of companies. <p>

<p>

"The window of opportunity in the public market may have closed after Infoseek," which went public two weeks
ago, said analyst Keith Benjamin of investment house Robertson, Stephens &amp; Company. "Everybody's
acknowledging that it's going to be a tough race, and consolidation in this industry seems inevitable." <p>

<p>

Nevertheless, Benjamin has assigned a "buy" rating to Excite stock, which closed today at 8-3/8, up 1/8 of a
point. Competitor Yahoo was also up, by 2-3/4 points at 21, while Lycos was up half of a point to close at
11-1/8. <p>

<p>

Industry observers said that the merger is a smart idea for Excite. "They've got a lot of momentum in terms of
presence not only with general links to their site but with companies adopting their technology to search their
own public Web sites," said Ross Rubin, editor of the newsletter Internet  Business Report. The main advantage
that Magellan will bring to the consolidation is a Web site directory with 40,000 reviews and one of the top three
site-rating systems, according to Rubin. <p>

<p>

The merger of the two companies, which were headed in opposite directions, will create the second-largest
Internet search engine, adding the rating system and directory of The McKinley Group's Magellan On-Line Guide
to Excite's search service. The combined service is expected to assume the Excite brand. <p>

<p>

The deal is valued at roughly $18 million, a figure based on the average trading price of Excite for the last 30
days. Excite raised more than $39 million in an initial public offering in April.  Despite a big boost in audience
share when Netscape Communications added Magellan to its often-visited Net Search page in April, the
Sausalito, California-based McKinley has recently run into trouble. <p>

<p>

First, a venture to go public didn't gain sufficient interest from investment bankers, according to today's Los
Angeles Times. Then a proposed merger with multimedia publisher Novo Media Group of San Francisco fell
through. Then the McKinley directors, sisters Isabel and Christine Maxwell, ousted the company's president three
days ago.<p>

<b>3m Invents a Better Mouse Pad: </b>3M, the company that transformed the office with products such as Post-it
notes and Scotch transparent tape, has developed the 3M Precise Mousing Surface, an innovative mouse pad
designed to enhance computer mouse and user performance. <p>

<p>

Based on 3M's patented microreplication technology, the 3M Precise Mousing Surface offers enhanced tracking
performance from a super-thin mouse pad. The surface allows users to maintain accurate contact between the
mouse, the pad and the software, making mouse movements faster and more exact. <p>

<p>

The thin, flat surface has a special shape, based on 3M hand/motion studies, that allows the user's hand to be in
a natural, relaxed position when moving the mouse. This provides maximum comfort and gives users the ability
to finely control cursor placement. <p>

<p>

Diwa Ratnam, new products laboratory manager, 3M Consumer Stationery Division, said the mousing surface
gives the user the ultimate in "WYPYWYG" (pronounced "WIPPY-WIG") -- Where You Point Is Where You
Go. <p>

<p>

The low-profile design of the mousing surface holds securely to the work surface, making traditional foam pads
feel cumbersome and outmoded.   Microreplication is a core 3M technology used to create microscopic, precisely
shaped, three-dimensional structures on surfaces such as plastic film. A magnified side view of the 3M Precise
Mousing Surface displays rows of peaks and valleys. This design allows the trackball to roll over the structure's
"peaks," while hand oil, dirt and dust fall into the "valleys." This keeps the trackball clean and rolling smoothly. <p>

<p>

The 3M Precise Mousing Surface is available at major consumer, computer and office product retail outlets such
as CompUSA, Micro Center and Elek-Tek, and through direct mail merchandisers. Available in an abstract indigo
and black design, the new mouse pad has an approximate U.S. retail price of $15. For more information, call
1-800-3M-HELPS (1-800-364-3577), send email to innovation@mmm.com or visit the 3M web site at

<b>Double Agent: </b>It sometimes seems that the more RAM you put in your computer, the more Windows 95 wants.
Ever wonder where it goes? Agent 95 from Connectix (800 950-5880) is a $60 utility that can tell you what
applications are using the RAM. (One look at the memory consumed by Web browsers such as Netscape
Navigator should persuade you to close them when not in use.) Agent 95 also helps you tune your system for
optimum performance, and a RAM compression program may give you some modest performance improvement.<p>

<p>

<b>Metrobeat Purchased: </b>CitySearch, a local information provider with national aspirations, will today acquire
Metrobeat, publisher of a popular New York City information Web guide, according to The New York Times. <p>

<p>

CitySearch, with backing from Goldman, Sachs, AT&amp;T Ventures, and several private investors, is attempting
to create a national chain of local Web-based city guides. The company already operates sites in Raleigh-Duram,
North Carolina, and Pasadena, California, and plans to establish sites in some 30 cities by the end of 1997. <p>

<p>

But the company will soon find itself fending off some deep-pocketed competitors, most notably Microsoft,
which plans to open a similar service in New York and several other cities sometime next year. Microsoft also
made an unsuccessful bid to acquire Metrobeat, according to the Times.  No terms of the acquisition were
disclosed.<p>

<p>

<b>America Online Expands Internet Services:</b> AOL expnded its menu of Internet services today with the launch
of a Web-hosting service called PrimeHost. <p>

<p>

AOL's is out to redefine itself as a new media company with a long list of complementary but separate services,
rather than focus solely on its the online service that has been its cash cow. Last month, AOL became the
advertising broker for Netscape Communications' highly popular Web site and  then expanded ad sales on its own
proprietary service.<p>

<p>

Now, AOL is muscling in on the Web-hosting market, a rapidly growing field that does all the
server-maintenance grunt work for companies that want sites but not the hassle of servers, storage, and
bandwidth. <p>

<p>

Up to now, Internet service providers and a few expensive ad agencies have been the primary sources for hosting
third-party Web sites, often in deals bundled with design and promotion. But AOL is leaving the site design to
its customers, preferring to simply open up its extensive infrastructure to outside companies. <p>

<p>

AOL will offer three levels of hosting service: <p>

--Domain. This will set up small businesses with a unique domain name and Web address and up to 50MB of disk
storage. This service will cost $199 in start-up fees, plus $100 for a two-year domain name registration, plus a
$99 monthly fee. <p>

--Commercial. This service, targeted at small and medium-sized businesses, allots up to 100MB of disk storage
and lets users add forms and data collection to their Web sites for connecting the hosted sites to back-end<p>

databases. The price is $249 for start-up fees, plus the $100 domain name registration and another $199 a month.<p>

--Dedicated. Tailored for large businesses, this version includes dedicated server hardware and software with at
least 4GB of storage. The service costs $499 to start up, $100 for the domain name, and $1,799 per month. <p>

<p>

For each service, PrimeHost will register the domain name with InterNIC, provide seven-day-a-week customer
support, and monitor site usage. All customers also get remote authoring tools and pre-designed templates to
build commerce-oriented sites. <p>

<p>

Meanwhile, other Web-hosting companies are already struggling to differentiate their services from each other's.
A chain of hosting bureaus called USWeb today teamed up with the Recreational Software Advisory Council to
add RSAC's content rating system to all sites created by USWeb. <p>

<p>

The rating system, called RSACi, requires a Webmaster to fill out a detailed questionnaire on specific content.
The answers are then translated into a rating for categories such as sex, nudity, violence, and hate speech.
Browsers then read those codes and block or limit access to the page, according to the limits set in advance by
the user. <p>

<p>

<b>Digital Camera Extras:</b> As digital cameras and scanners get cheaper, many PC owners are adding pictures to
homemade newsletters and documents. But playing around with those digital images is often a chore, forcing
neophytes to deal with such concepts as ``gamma correction'' and ``saturation.'' Kai's Power GOO, a program
developed by MetaTools Inc. in Carpinteria, Calif., makes it easy not only to adjust digital images but also to add
special effects.<p>

<p>

Unlike most image-editing programs, which manipulate pixel by pixel, the $50 Power GOO uses mathematical
formulas across the entire image. That allows users to see the effects of their manipulations in ``real time.'' To
give the Mona Lisa a bigger smile, just click on Power GOO's ``nudge'' button, then drag the corners of her
mouth farther up. Owners can save a series of images to make a ``GOOie,'' or digital movie, that can be shared
with other PC owners. Kai's Power GOO is the first consumer software from MetaTools, which has a strong
following among serious graphic designers. Power GOO runs on Apple Computer Inc.'s Power Macs and
IBM-compatible PCs running Win95. It also comes with Eastman Kodak Co.'s new digital cameras.<p>

<p>

<b>The Plextor 8Plex:</b> Buckle up: The era of eight-speed CD-ROM drives is finally here. The Plextor 8Plex series
unleashes its multimedia magic at literally twice the rate of the average quad-speed drive.<p>

<p>

We took Plextor's 8Plex internal model for a spin. The 5.25-inch drive has a Fast SCSI interface and ships with
its own SCSI data cable and an Adaptec AHA-2940 SCSI controller (the same one that's found in Adaptec's
Power Storage hard drive kit, reviewed above, with similar speed advantages).<p>

<p>

The 8Plex rises to the challenge of today's software--especially when running games directly from the CD-ROM
drive. For instance, when we ran Descent II and Rebel Assault II with full-motion video and music segments in
a quad-speed drive, the games tended to drop frames during video segments. But with the 8Plex, which transfers
data at about 1.2 megabits per second (as opposed to 600 bits with most quad-speed drives), we couldn't tell the
difference between video run off the disc and clips run off the hard drive.<p>

<p>

The 8Plex has smarts, too: The drive uses only about 10 percent of your computer's CPU brainpower, which
helps speed overall performance. The now-common six-speed CD-ROM drives are fine for most of today's
software, but they're already huffing and puffing when running some of the more advanced multimedia software
on store shelves. If you're a game fan upgrading your CD-ROM drive, it may pay to look ahead of the curve.

<p>

<b>Intel Accelerates Release of 200-mhz Pentium:</b> Three months ago, Intel anticipated bringing out its superfast
200-MHz Pentium chips by the end of the year. Looks like it's Christmas in July, because the chips are already
here--and home computer manufacturers are speeding up their production to deliver models that use the
screamers by this summer.<p>

<p>

At press time, IBM was all set to add a 200-MHz Pentium system to its Aptiva line in June (prices hadn't been
determined). While the difference between 200- and 166-MHz performance in everyday computing may not set
many home PC shoppers' hearts racing, the new Aptiva adds other goodies that put the extra muscle to good use.
For starters, the system features TheatreSound, complete with high-power stereo speakers and a subwoofer, and
Total Image Video, which delivers full-screen, three-dimensional action--pop the 3-D version of the included
MechWarrior 2 disc into the six-speed CD-ROM drive and you'll be floored by the realistic detail. The optional
Home Director makes it possible to let your computer control everything from the time your coffeemaker starts
percolating to when the lights come on in your house. The program can even record your appliance usage over
a three-day period and duplicate it when you're on vacation, making it look like someone's at home.<p>

<p>

Meanwhile, AST's Advantage! 829 (below; $2,799, or $3,099 with monitor) pads its 200-MHz powerhouse with
treats of a more conventional sort: 16 megabytes of RAM, a 2.5-gigabyte hard drive, an eight-speed CD-ROM
drive, full-screen MPEG video playback, and sharp "3-D sound" via wavetable synthesis. IBM, (800) 426-3333,
(914) 765-1900, http://www.ibm.com. AST, (800) 876-4278, (714) 727-4141, http://www.ast.com.<b><p>

<h2>GET CONNECTED APPLE'S WAY</h2>
<h3>By Tif Bailey</h3>
<p>

About the time of the demise of e-World, Apple began offering the Apple Internet Connection Kit which listed
for $89 but can be found for as little as $35. It has the basics of everything that's needed to connect a Mac to the
net either via a dial-up modem or as part of a local area network. It is expected that you have an internet service
provider(ISP). Indeed, unlike a lot of bundles it does not come with demos and offers of free time from any
online service.<p>

<p>

It can be purchased on standard floppies or Compact Disk. It comes with a sixty page "Getting Started" booklet
which is quite helpful for the beginners. I would guess that many newbes are turned off by the two inch think
introductory books. It comes with individual internet applications for the World Wide Web, E-mail, Newsgroups,
File Transfer Protocol(FTP), and Telnet. The web tool is Netscape Navigator 2.0 with an online manual furnished
in Adobe Acrobat. The E-mail program is Claris Emailer Lite. NewsWatcher is the news reader and Fetch is the
FTP program. Rounding out the suite is NCSA's Telnet program.<p>

<p>

The recommended configuration is System 7.5 or later running on a 68030 processor chip or better. At least 8
megabytes(MB) of random-access memory is needed with 12 recommended. Hard drive space needed is at least
10 MB with 21 MB recommended. Finally a Mac compatible modem running at 14,400 bps or faster. With the
built in sound capability of most Macs a color monitor greatly enhances Web page viewing. Depending on the
form of the software, a high density floppy drive or a CD-ROM player will be needed. The software must be
installed on the hard drive for operation. <p>

<p>

An installer program on the CD puts everything where it belongs. Once installed and the Mac restarted the
applications must be configured as needed by the ISP or network system administrator. Apple also furnishes
telephone support but they cannot guess at the settings needed by the internet service provider. When, speaking
with the ISP be sure to ask for someone who knows the Mac TCP and ConfigPPP setup procedure for their
service.<p>

<p>

Macs have been used to connect to the internet before it was open to the public, with all the tools brought
together in one package it is even easier now. My old Mac Plus can do e-mail, newsgroup, telenet, and FTP
applications but it can't surf the web. The Connection Kit is made for the newer Macs, to be sure.<p>

<p>

<i>Thanks Tif, see you next month.</i><p>

<h2>YOU MAY NEED MORE STORAGE THAN YOU THINK:<i></h2>
<h3></b></i>By Craig Crossman<b><i></h3>
<b><p>

</b></i>QUESTION. My new computer came with a 1 gigabyte drive and I thought that this was all the space I would
ever need. Was I wrong! Who would believe? One thousand megabytes and I'm already running out of room!
I was considering adding one of those removable drives like the Zip Drive and wondered if you would share your
thoughts about this.<p>

<p>

ANSWER. I'm hard pressed to think of a place where the old adage "No matter how big it is, you'll eventually
want a bigger one" more accurately applies.<p>

<p>

I can remember when having a 30-megabyte hard drive was a big deal. And given that most programs were well
under a single megabyte in those days, that was all you needed. But today's graphical operating systems with their
complex applications demand numerous megabytes. Just a word processor can easily take up well over 30
megabytes of storage space.<p>

<p>

A little over a year ago, I reported on Iomega's Zip Drive. This removable hard disk stores 100 megabytes of data
on a single replaceable cartridge that you insert into the drive. When it fills up, pop it out and add another. The
Zip Drive has proven to be a huge success.<p>

<p>

But Iomega hasn't been resting on its laurels. They just recently introduced the Jaz Drive. The cartridge is nearly
the same size as the Zip but one Jaz cartridge stores 10 times more, which equals one full gigabyte of storage.
And the Jaz Drive is as fast as most of today's speedy fixed hard disk drives.<p>

<p>

Jaz comes with a plethora of software utilities, including an easy to use "one button" backup application. But the
most interesting one is called Guest. Given the portability of the Jaz Drive, it is conceivable you might want to
take it with you and plug it into someone else's computer. Running the Guest program installs all of the necessary
drivers and modifications to the operating system. When you are finished, Guest acts like a well-mannered guest
and automatically removes any and all modifications. When you remove Jaz Drive, no evidence remains it was
ever there.<p>

<p>

Jaz is available in external or internal models and supports several interfaces, such as parallel port, EISA and
SCSI. Jaz comes with a gigabyte cartridge that contains both Macintosh and PC software, since Jaz works on
either platform.<p>

<p>

The Jaz Drive sells for $599, with each gigabyte cartridge selling at $99 from Iomega<p>

<p>

IBM UNVEILS CORDLESS MODEM<p>

<p>

It's not my habit to write about products that haven't yet made it to the market, but I saw a nifty new IBM
modem technology at the New York PC Expo. Basically, it's a cordless modem that works just like cordless
phone. <p>

<p>

Now why didn't I think of that? About the size of a pocket calculator, you can operate the modem up to 100 feet
away from the nearest phone jack without plugging in a phone cable. The unit works with your existing built-in
modem, third-party modem cards and external modems. It requires no special software, so it works with any
platform such as the PC or the Macintosh.<p>

<p>

The yet-to-be-named modem uses the cleaner and more reliable 900-megahertz frequency used by today's
top-of-the-line cordless phones. It supports speeds up to 28.8 bits-per-second. You can see it in action on IBM's
web site: www.research.ibm.com. IBM expects to have a product available by the end of the year. <p>

<h2>Help for your Home Office</h2>
<p>

I know we all like to make fun of the Postal Service, but these days, snail mail doesn't creep along at a glacial
pace the way it used to. And when you use overnight services such as FedEx or UPS, packages are just two steps
behind your e-mail. But although most e-mail servers send error messages when e-mail doesn't go through, I've
never known FedEx to call when my package didn't make it to its destination on time.<p>

<p>

To make sure you're on top of your overnight service, get online. Both FedEx (www.fedex.com) and UPS
(www.ups.com) offer free tracking software and easy-to-use tracking services on their Web sites. In addition,
FedEx provides free shipping software to its customers. Just call 1-800-gofedex for info and the free software.<p>

<p>

If you want your office to run even more smoothly, check out Mindscape's Home Office Assistant, a new bundle
of utilities and reference works for small business. The package includes shipping and tracking software, tools

<h2>How do you pay for the HelpDesk?</h2>
<h3>Theodore A Isabella</h3>
<p>

A recent article in a trade publication about the HelpDesk function started me thinking. The first thing I noticed
about the article is that it seemed to miss the point.  Please don't misunderstand me, I'm not intending to
criticizing the authors of the article.  However, it was obvious to me the authors were not writing from a
pragmatic perspective, in others words they had <b>NOT</b> been there, done that.<p>

<p>

The content of the article made me realize how far off the mark perspectives are relative to what the HelpDesk
does  pragmatically.  For example,  I'd be willing to bet if you asked 10 budget managers (folks who pay for IS
services) what the HelpDesk is you'd get 10 different answers.<p>

<p>

What's important to remember is I'm talking about the same folks whom, when the numbers start to get squeezed
and they start looking at cutting costs, utter words like, " I don't get any value for the HelpDesk...".  Which
points to a basic misunderstanding of what the HelpDesk is all about.  Another point, and I think more important,
has the HelpDesk mission ever been defined for their business?<p>

<p>

<p>

What might be a useful exercise for these managers to experience is to have them endure the consequence of their
thinking.   They'd learn calls for help are not too dissimilar to water and electricity, both follow the path of least
resistance.  When someone needs help they will find it, and it's that effort which costs money.<p>

<p>

Putting aside the revenge factor and turning our attention to a more scientific approach, I propose what might
be more helpful is for leadership to study the <u>content</u> of the calls for help.  Such an examination would be helpful
in identifying why there is a need for a HelpDesk in their business.  It would also be practical in helping to define
the mission of the HelpDesk (how the HelpDesk folks are to put metal on target).<p>

<p>

My personal experience indicates studying the calls will produce 3 broad categories, answering the singular
question - "What are the major causes of calls for help?"<p>

<p>

	(1)  Leadership's lack of commitment to training.<p>

	(2) The lack of understanding about the need for formal and on-going 				training.<p>

	(3) The placement of complex technology into the hands of folks who are inadequately trained 		to use it - let alone how to leverage it to make critical business decisions.<p>

	<p>

These 3 categories can be summed up using 3 key words, <u>commitment</u>, <u>understanding</u>, and <u>inadequate</u>.  With
these key elements in mind, while not losing sight of the aforementioned categories, let's ask another
question, "what is the HelpDesk for?"<p>

<p>

The answer will vary but there will be one overriding theme.  When a user calls they want a live voice and an
immediate answer to their questions (no matter how rude they are).                                                                 
                         <p>

Using this as a jump-off point let's examine the calls from the callers perspective - how users REALLY use the
HelpDesk.  I think we'll find a very interesting trend.  I postulate that most calls for help are really calls  for on-demand training.<p>

<p>

Don't believe me?  Stop by your local HelpDesk and listen to some calls.  You'll find most of the calls will begin
with phrases like, "how do I do..?"  or, "can you tell me how?"  Most user are NOT calling to report a problem. 
For example, "the printer on the second floor stopped working", or,"my hard drive is making a funny noise". 
The point is, most callers call to get a <u>correct</u> <u>answer</u> to a question on how to use a specific application, (notice
also, I used the words correct answer).  A fine example of this is a caller wanting to know, "how do I do a mail
merge in Microsoft Word?"  Incidentally, I don't mind admitting I've answered that question by telling the user
to call Mr. So and So's secretary.<p>

<p>

 I'm sure many folks reading this article are shaking their heads saying... "SO?  Isn't that what a HelpDesk is
for?"  My response is, ask the folks who are paying the bill?   Ask them - what is their expectation?  Then, based
on their expectation, staff the HelpDesk accordingly.  Making the callers pay for the level of service they
budgeted for can really help them see reality.<p>

<p>

The budget managers mentioned earlier could avoid most of what they pay for in HelpDesk costs if those making
the call took a moment to read the user guide which came with the software.  That's why  it's important for
budget managers to understand the costs associated with what they are wiling to pay for.  Do they want experts
for on-demand telephone training?  If so, they need to be prepared to pay for that service.  Or, do they insist their
business need requires only someone to answer the phone so the printer on the third floor can be restarted.  In
this case, they need to accept the level of service they are paying for.<p>

<p>

A critical message that's important for IS managers to get across to their peers is, it is unethical to pay for one
level of service and demand another.  Not to mention the audacity it takes to pay for a low level of service and
then complain about it.<p>

<p>

Here's what I propose to fix the problem.  First, leadership, at the highest level, must make a commitment to
think of IS (or computing in any form) as a manufacturing process, raw material in, finished product out. <p>

<p>

Second, stop making IS justify its existence.  Try running your business without the use of computers or the folks
who understand how to use them.  When you force IS to justify its existence you waste their time and your
money.  One of the biggest wastes of money I can think of is forcing IS to count CPU clicks so they can "charge
back" usage.  You decrease capacity as well as impact CPU horsepower. <p>

<p>

Third, train your users well and continually.  Insist your managers train their people.  Make them accountable
for the competency of their people in the use of the technological environment particular to your business.  Or,
make them pay accordingly to staff the HelpDesk appropriately.  By the way, it's very easy and inexpensive to
make budget managers face the reality of paying for HelpDesk staff.  The HelpDesk can require a charge-code
for each call it receives and then send a monthly bill to the Accounting Department.  You watch what happens
after the first month!  To do something like this would take about 5 minutes on a standalone desktop unit.<p>

<p>

Finally, those at the highest level of business leadership must reshape their idea of IS in general.  Specifically in
relation to this article, they need to rethink their view about the HelpDesk.  The demand by a CEO for IS to
qualify, in dollars, the service IS is delivering, is NOT valid.  However, what is valid is the CEO to demand IS
deliver a cost effective product.  Big difference.<p>

<p>

This kind of thinking requires leadership to think about IS in more traditional terms.  How can IS  deliver a
product which meets the essential and critical business needs?  This traditional thinking requires leadership to also
think of IS in a more centralized way.  Centralization, in spite of what the opposition says, saves money and
controls costs effectively.  A very important residual effect of Centralization is how it help's a business narrow
its training focus.  It does this by driving  a business to a standard environment.<p>

<p>

A fine example of this is the Client Server environment.  Just because  technology has matured to computers
smaller in physical size does not necessitate the need for centralization. 									After all, centralization is a synonym for control.  Centralized control over protecting data means essential
business critical data can be recovered.  Centralized control over Operational Procedures means there is a
company wide perspective on system design, deployment, and how they are leveraged in the drive to improve
profits.<p>

<p>

How does all this dovetail into what I'm addressing in the article?  Centralized control over how money is  spent
on the deployment of technology is a key component to understand.  For example, the Accounting Department
loves the  PC's it uses but the Marketing Department has other ideas.  Marketing's critical business needs are
better served using Macintosh's.  Armed with this truth the Marketing Department goes out and purchases
Macintosh's.  The next day calls start to come in to the HelpDesk asking "how do I start this thing up?"  "Start
what up?",  the HelpDesk technician responds. You as the CEO made sure your HelpDesk was qualified in the
current systems used in your company - that is PC's.  Heck, you thought a Macintosh was an Apple.  Now, what
do you do?  Shouldn't be there in the first place!<p>

<p>

Think it couldn't happened?  I once responded to a caller that complained that since she came back from vacation
"her" Macintosh would not turn-on.  I arrived at the scene and walking over tapped the power-on button on the
keyboard. The Mac powered up normally.<p>

<p>

The woman sat in stunned silence.  "What  did you do?"  She asked.  At this point I asked her to demonstrate
how she turned the Macintosh off when she was ready to go home and how she turned it on when she arrived
back the next morning.  She reached behind the monitor and turned the monitor off.  Turns out, the temporary
worker who covered in her absence was more familiar with Macintosh computers and shut it down and started
it up normally.  Whereas the company employee had no clue - she had been turning the Macintosh's monitor off
and on for two years - ever since she received it!<p>

<p>

<p>

All this drives me back to my earlier points;  (1) Leadership's lack of commitment to training.  (2) The lack of
understanding about the need for formal and on-going training.  (3) The placement of complex technology into
the hands of folks who are inadequately trained to use it.<p>

<p>

Business leadership must reshape its view of IS.  It must make a commitment to training.  And most important,
as far as this article is concerned, it must establish a clear mission for its HelpDesk, while communicating what
that mission is to every employee.  Staffing it according to the funding it receives.<p>

<p>

There was once a TV commercial advertising oil filters for cars, its motto was "pay me now ($5.00) or pay me
later (new engine)".  HelpDesk costs are similar, its just a matter of where and when.<p>

<h2>Color Printers For Less Than $200</h2>
<h3>By Jenn T.</h3>
<p>

If you're thinking of stepping up from a black-and-white printer, green is invariably the first color that comes to
mind, given all the cash you may think you need to spend. The good news is that Canon has lowered the price
on its BJC-210 ink jet model to a level that won't make you see red.<p>

<p>

Now selling for $199, the BJC-210 churns out four pages per minute in black and white (with a maximum
resolution of 720 by 360 dpi) and 0.27 ppm in color (at up to 360 by 360 dpi). The top-loading printer, which
tips the scales at slightly less than six pounds and fits within the dimensions of a legal pad, can handle 100 sheets
of plain paper, 15 envelopes or 40 transparencies. The included Color Advisor software will help ensure that your
printouts have the right balance of tones.<p>

<p>

To give you the impetus to experiment with Color Advisor, the BJC-210 comes with the Creative CD-ROM,
which includes print projects from Hallmark Connections Everyday Greetings, Crayola Art, Stationery Store,
Pattern Maker, Sticker &amp; Label Store, and more than 300 clip-art images and TrueType fonts. For $9.95 more,
you'll get the Starter Kit of paper samples (coated, transparency, backprint and high-gloss) and T-shirt iron-ons.<p>

<p>

Finally, to guarantee that your reduced investment goes a long way, the printer carries a two-year warranty.

<b><h2>Politics on the Web</h2></b>
<h3>A.  Accetta</h3>
<p>
<hr>
The ranks of presidential hopefuls have thinned, but the online rhetoric from both candidates and top influencers
is so thick that it's time to but your boots on to avoid stepping in the political bs out there. Cyberspace is full of
political sound bites, video clips, and staged photos, plus reams of campaign promises, position papers, and
walk-on-water biographies of favorite sons who want your vote.<p>

<p>

Incumbent (Mr. 40% of the vote) Bill Clinton doesn't yet have an official re-election Web presence because he
won't formally enter the race until later this year. But, as the Clinton 
section of the <a href="politicsusa.com/PoliticsUSA/campaign96/candidates/clinton.html.cgi">PoliticsUSA site</a> 
points out, he is accepting campaign
contributions in the meantime. If you can't wait for Bill's campaign to become official, you can at least visit the
virtual equivalent of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue at <a 
href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">www.whitehouse.gov.</a> Too bad it can be 
almost as hard to
get into as the real thing. Once there be sure to check out the message from Socks, the official cat of the
Whitehouse. <p>

<p>

Supporters of the still-hopeful Pat Buchanan have built a 
tradition-flavored site at <a 
href="http://www.buchanan.org">www.buchanan.org.</a> The
sepia-toned photo on the opening page suggests an earlier, simpler time, or maybe that fake looking old
Confederate money kids used to play with. "Pat Buchanan Is Our Braveheart!" was one headline when we
checked out the site. Sorry, but Pat's one guy I would not want to see in a Scottish kilt, though who knows, in
private he may look very nice in a dress..<p>

<p>

Speaking of die-hards, Ross, I am not going to run again, Perot is still raising hell at
<a 
href="http://www.competition96.com/perot/perot.htm">www.competition96.com/perot/perot.htm</a>, 
and the Libertarians--who have had a significant presence on the Net
since its early days--are holding forth at <a 
href="http://www.libertarian.com/96/">www.libertarian.com/96/.</a><p>

<p>

As for the Republican front-runner, a trip to <a 
href="http://www.dole96.com">www.dole96.com</a> 
will get you a "personal message" (uh-huh) from
the candidate, access to a library of Dole-iana, and--hold on--screen savers of the senator or, if you prefer, his
schnauzer Leader(woopie!!). A Bob Dole screen saver? Get it any way and 20 years from now you can sell it as
a political memento from the days of the web.<p>

<p>

As always if you go to any of the many search engines on the web and type in keywords like politics, you'll get
a great deal of sites that you can check out. The ones above are just the tip of a very big iceberg.<p>

<p>

<i>Editor's Note - just as the article was going to print this new info became available so we have added it here
for you.</i><p>

<p>

The Clinton-Gore organization put up its site on the Internet's World Wide Web on July 3, 1996.  Dole campaign
officials say their Web site, begun last September for the Republican 
primaries, will be overhauled in two weeks (so get the screen savers now 
before they are gone for good). For Clinton/Gore Go to: <a 
href="http://www.cg96.org"> http://www.cg96.org.</a><p>

<p>

Both sites are partly marketing gestures intended to emphasize that their candidates are men of the future, at ease
with modern technology. <p>

<p>

The Clinton-Gore site has photographs of the candidates that change every few seconds and animated graphics
depicting job growth and budget reduction under Clinton. Audio and video 
clips are available. And button-shaped campaign logos and poster-style graphics can be printed out. <p>

<p>

The new Dole site, campaign officials say, will have some of those features and will also enable the user to tailor
the site based on issue or location. <p>

<p>

In the presidential election, officials of both campaigns agree, the Internet is still mainly experimental. A single
television advertisement in New York or Los Angeles might well be watched by more people than would tap into
a political Web site in months. Since the Dole site went up last September, it has attracted only 400,000 visitors.
Yet, the people who tap into a Web site are more involved than television viewers. The Dole campaign has signed
up more than 6,500 of its 30,000 volunteers through the Internet. <p>

<h2>Descent II</h2>
<p>
<hr>
Drop everything and get ready to dive into a second rollicking ride through the tortuous mine
shafts of Descent. Descent II has the 360-degree range of motion, the warp speed,
and the
crunching heavy-metal soundtrack that made its predecessor a hit, but adds both a new arsenal to
increase the
adrenaline, and a "guidebot" (an intelligent mechanical device) to help newcomers find their way
around.<p>

<p>

Descent II takes you through six worlds; your goal is to work through the five mines in each, find
each mine's
main reactor, destroy it, then race through the emergency exit before you're blown up with the
rest of the mine.
You'll pick up deadly cannons and battle 30 robotic enemies along the way.<p>

<p>

It's no easy feat. Unlike games such as Doom, Duke Nukem 3D and Hexen, in which levels exist
on only
horizontal planes, Descent II lets you fly in any direction. Start traveling forward through one
mine shaft, then
look up and you may see a passage in the ceiling. Miss it, and you're likely to pass up a host of
new weapons,
power-ups, enemies and, in this version, a new wrinkle--hostages who are waiting for you to
rescue them.<p>

<p>

Fortunately, your new friend, the guidebot, is a great bloodhound. Once you find the little blue
bot on each level,
it can sniff out items and passages you've missed. Of course, for every new ally, there's bound to
be a new enemy,
too. In this case, you'll have to watch out for the thiefbot, who will gleefully run off with your
weapons and
power-ups.<p>

<p>

The fresh arsenal, hostages, added complexities and two new bots are great improvements to an
already superior
game, and the pounding soundtrack is a perfect match: Guitars hammer away at a dizzying tempo
that matches
the speed with which you fly through the mines. Any way you slice it, Descent II really rocks.<p>

<h2>Alphabet Express - For PC/MAC</b></h2>
<p>

What do trains, alligators and education have in common with your preschooler? The answer is School Zone's
TM activity-packed CD-Rom, Alphabet Express.<p>

<p>

Riding the Alphabet Express with Mr. Conductor (a friendly green alligator) as their guide, little ones journey
through activities of dot-to-dot games, hidden letter scenes, point and click programs, mazes, songs, and their
all time favorite; coloring pages. Along their jaunt, their play becomes learning, and learning becomes fun.<p>

<p>

Not your ordinary point and click program, Alphabet Express is an adventure that will keep little fingers busy
and their minds chugging along. Learning the ABCs does happen to be as easy as pointing and clicking, but the
fun doesn't end there. There are 78 coloring pages for Rembrandt Junior to color and print, or simply print out
to color the Crayola way. Your little one will help the doggie firefighter douse the fire by matching letters to
sounds. And after a hard day fighting fires, tiny tots can relax by clicking on the featured movie, starring, of
course, the alphabet.<p>

 <p>

School ZoneTM Publishing Company specializes in education publications, and has been honored by the Parent
Council for its work in Alphabet Express. You are no doubt wondering that burning question that all parents ask
before they lay out the money for a new software program for their children; will it keep MY child busy long
enough for me to get a few minutes of peace? The answer is a resounding "yes." And except for the littlest ones,
the Alphabet Express journey is one they can handle on their own, with the help of green Mr. Conductor. Mr.
Conductor's interactive audio directions talk your tiny one though each destination on the rail, without the need
for heavy parental supervision.<p>

<p>

Your second burning question is no doubt the same as a friend of mine, can a normal parent install the program
with ease? Rest assured that Alphabet Express's CD-Rom is parent- friendly, and unlike that bicycle with two
thousand moving pieces that takes all Christmas Eve to assemble, Alphabet Express takes just minutes to install
and play.<p>

<p>

Every time I go to my neighborhood computer store it seem like low-priced computer games are a dime a dozen,
but if the game play isn't satisfying, the program's no bargain and you feel like you wasted your hard-earned
bucks. Some of the games I've bought (too numerous to list here) have been real dogs. I couldn't even give them
away at a recent garage sale.<p>

<p>

There are however a few good ones out there. One such "good buy" is The Maxis Collector's Series which boasts
eight proven winners on disc, now marked down to just $14.95 each, including the ever-popular SimCity Classic,
SimFarm Classic, SimEarth Classic and SimAnt Classic (Windows 3.1 CD-ROM, Macintosh CD-ROM); stars
on the diamond and in the sky with Baseball for Windows and Discover Astronomer (Windows 3.1 CD-ROM);
and, for kids, Zaark and the Night Team: The Quest for Patterns, and Zurk's Li'l Safari (Windows 3.1 CD-ROM).
Maxis, (800) 526-2947, (510) 933-5630, <a

<p>

Watch for next month's review of a cool collection of classic text games that have just been reissued by
Activision. The collection is entitled 30 Classic Text Adventure Masterpieces. Text you say! Yes, text and some
of them are just as entertaining as the shoot-em ups of today. So, read the review next month and give em a
chance. <p>

<h2>Microsoft Continues To Buy Up Web Products</h2>
<p>

Adding to its collection of miscellaneous Internet tools, Microsoft today licensed a scrapbook tool from the
ForeFront Group that will let users drag and drop text and graphics--complete with working hyperlinks--from
a Web site into their applications. <p>

<p>

Called GrabNet, the tool creates a scrapbook on the desktop for storing copied text and graphics from Web sites,
which can then be duplicated into all manner of applications while maintaining all of the hyperlinks and other
HTML coding of the original. <p>

<p>

Microsoft hasn't figured out exactly what it's going to do with GrabNet yet: it will add support for the tool into
its Windows 95 desktop applications, but it's not sure which ones. Company representatives also aren't sure if
the tool would let users automatically launch browsers from within applications that contain the pasted-in
material. But the deal is consistent with Microsoft's recently developed habit of licensing any interesting Net tools
that might come in handy.  <p>

<p>

The deal marks the second time Microsoft has licensed ForeFront technology. Last February, the software giant
licensed the WebWhacker offline browsing tool for inclusion in its Internet Jump Start CD for classrooms. The
companies did not disclose terms of the licensing agreement.  <p>

<h2>Cyberdog &amp; System Updates </b></h2>
<h3>By Tif Bailey</h3>
<p>

Apple recently announced its own web browser, Cyberdog. Even though it's available for downloading on the
web it's not for everybody. The "read-me" makes it clear that Cyberdog is for a Power Macintosh with a least
8 megabytes(MB) of memory, 16 MB recommended, with Virtual Memory turned on, running System 7.5 or
higher with OpenDoc version 1.0.4 being required. These system elements are required before Cyberdog is
installed. Also MacTCP 2.0.4 or later or OpenTransport 1.1 or later with TCP/IP must be installed as well.<p>

<p>

If you have a Power Mac, where do you get OpenDoc and MacTCP? Well, OpenDoc can be down loaded
from Apple's web site, http://support.info.apple.com/, at the same time you get Cyberdog. OpenTransport
comes on the CD with System 7.5 Revision 2 update. Because Apple's FTP sites were so busy with the
system update, they made it available to registered users for FREE. Just like the good old days when system
updates were available at user group meetings or from friendly dealers.<p>

<p>

OpenDoc is a cross-platform technology; documents created with OpenDoc can work across different
computer platforms, including Mac OS, Windows, UNIX, and OS/2.<p>

<p>

There are several system update numbers being announced. System 7.5 Update 2 and System 7.5.3 Revision
2. Note the numbers and key word "Update" and "Revision." Some Macs are being shipped with System
7.5.3 installed. This system level may or may not be right for you depending on the Mac you have. System
7.5 Update 2.0 updates any computer running System 7.5, 7.5.1 or System 7.5.2 and consists of
approximately 14 floppy disks or CD equivalent. <p>

<p>

The installer on the CD for System 7.5, Update 2 takes care of the Mac model applicability. Hence, it is the
most generic and applicable for everyone. System 7.5.3 Revision 2 is for specific computers and consists of 2
floppy disks of information. Most of the changes affect Power Books and Power Macs.<p>

<p>

There are more details and frequently-asked-questions at the Apple 
Information Web site,

<h2>Virtual Coffee Houses: Welcome to a Whole Different Kind of
Espresso Bar</h2>
<h3>By Frank Jossi</h3>
<p>

On a vacation in Boston last summer, I wandered into Cybersmith, a space-age coffee gallery just around the
corner from Harvard Square in Cambridge. With fifty computer terminals surrounded by expensive cherrywood
cabinets and a bookstore and coffeehouse/deli where you order via a monitor, Cybersmith felt like something out
of The Jetsons.<p>

<p>

Dubbing itself a "cyber cafe," Cybersmith offers access to the Internet, online services, CD-ROMs, virtual-reality
devices, and entertainment systems including the Sony Playstation and FaceMorpher. Customers buy a plastic
Cybersmith credit card with three to twenty dollars worth of time and take off into cyberspace.<p>

<p>

Time Flies...<p>

<p>

I found time moved quickly-five dollars bought me just fifteen minutes of Internet access, barely enough to fully
appreciate REM's home page or check out CNN's offerings while carefully sipping coffee to avoid any spillage
on the keyboard. Cybersmith's machines cost around twenty cents a minute-or twelve dollars an hour-which must
be the highest hourly Internet connection in greater Boston.<p>

<p>

The cafe even provides a brochure with a mission statement proclaiming that computers "signal a change in
society" as great as the transformation brought about by the Industrial Revolution. The store's push is to give
computer users a chance to test new products, receive training, and surf the Internet while enjoying the concept
of community that is allegedly blossoming in cyberspace.<p>

<p>

Cyber cafes have become an international Internet trend that mixes coffee, conversation, and the Net. Japan,
France, Great Britain, Australia, and other countries now boast self-appointed cyber cafes. (For a complete list,
check out Java Link: Ye Olde Internet Cafe &amp; <a href="http://astro.ocis.temple.edu/~ghinkle/
java.html" Coffee Resource Page</a>. These cafes range from ones like 
Cybersmith to coffeeshops like the one in my St. Paul neighborhood
that offers Internet access at a slow baud rate on just one terminal.<p>

<p>

Come As You Are<p>

<p>

Midrange in the world of cyber cafes is CyberX, a grungy cafe in Minneapolis with a backbeat provided by
Nirvana. Located in a neighborhood of Generation X cutting-edge cognoscenti, the cafe offers four computers
with large terminals hooked into a T1 telecommunications line in an atmosphere that's a touch severe for my
tastes.<p>

<p>

On a midwinter visit to CyberX, I found the place deserted, perhaps because the grunge "background" music was
cranked to an excruciating, conversation-killing level. But the monitors were large enough for our party of three
to easily see and the T1 connection offered the kind of surfing speed I've rarely experienced on the Web.<p>

<p>

While I have now seen several full-fledged and semi-wired cyber cafes, I question whether these niche players
on the java scene will survive. Part of the ideology of the cyber cafe-besides linking two growing passions of
American life, coffee and computers-is to attempt to create a community in real time and place rather than just
through the bland text of electronic mail or newsgroups.<p>

<p>

But in fact, many people who spend their lives working on computers-as I do-try to get as far away from the
technology as possible in our free time. We go to cafes to slow down, reflect, converse, argue, read, view a
neighbor's artwork on the walls, sit in solitude, and gossip. Computing and Net surfing, on the other hand, are
mainly conducted in the solitude of home or office, and friendships often are forged by exchanging email
messages and perhaps then meeting in person to talk.<p>

<p>

Asking someone to go cyberspace hopping at a cafe is a little like asking someone to watch you read a book. The
visual dynamics of computing don't lend themselves well to interpersonal interaction-the box isn't big and much
of the Net is still text driven. And computing traditionally has not been an instrument of social interaction outside
of electronic mail and newsgroups.<p>

<p>

The High Cost of Surfing<p>

<p>

Finally, the cyber cafes I've visited have a big mark against them in terms of cost. The five-to-seven-dollar an
hour charges are double to triple what Internet service providers charge. Considering that Net surfing can be
addictive, a Nethead could go broke quickly at those rates. At least at sports bars, the owners don't charge for
watching television.<p>

<p>

As for that sense of community, I only met one person while using my neighborhood cafe's computer terminal.
I helped him find a home page-a strange one on alternative energy-and then suggested he add it as a bookmark
on the Netscape browser. "No thanks, I don't want anyone else to know about it. That could be dangerous," he
replied. Huh? He then jumped off to other sites before I could tell him of the Net's tradition of information
sharing. <p>

<p>

America certainly needs a greater sense of community, but I doubt that cyber cafes-if they last-will create
anything more than an entertaining diversion.     <p>

Minnesota.)<p>

<h2>Microsoft Previews Office 97 And Ships Direct 3D</b></h2>
<p>

REDMOND, WASHINGTON, U.S.A., 1996 JUN 13 (NB) -- Microsoft Corp. Continues to unroll its Internet
strategy with Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bill Gates' preview of Office 97. The software giant also
began shipment of its Windows 95 games technology, Direct 3D.<p>

<p>

Microsoft Office 97, a suite of desktop applications reportedly used by 22 million users, features Internet/intranet
connectivity with hyperlinking, searching, and navigational functionality. By tying the product to the Internet,
Microsoft intends to focus on collaborative computing. The area covers the ability to create, share, and analyze
documents simultaneously between two or more users.<p>

<p>

To further facilitate collaboration within a corporation, Microsoft introduced Microsoft Outlook, an addition to
Office 97. Outlook provides an integrated environment for managing e-mail, schedules, tasks, contacts, and files.
It is designed to work with Microsoft Office 97 for tight integration with other desktop applications.<p>

<p>

Addressing the need to combine desktop and Internet technologies, Pete Higgins, group vice president of the
applications and content group at Microsoft, said, "Intranets provide a great infrastructure for communicating,
but they are only as valuable as the information they contain. Office 97 delivers a powerful solution for business
users who want to take advantage of intranets. The addition of Microsoft Outlook now makes it possible for
Microsoft Office users to seamlessly integrate communications with their desktop information, everything from
financial data to electronic forms to calendar information.<p>

<p>

The new Office 97 allows users to create hyperlinks to and from any Office file. These links can link any Office,
hypertext markup language (HTML), or third-party file on any internal or external Web site, as well as any file
server. For searching, the new suite offers Web FindFast, which enables users to search for any key word or
property within an intranet using full-content index searching. Web FindFast can search across multiple servers
and a broad range of files, including both HTML and Office files." <p>

<p>

To highlight navigation, Office Web toolbar provides easy travel between linked documents. Users can use the
forward and backward buttons to move between documents, as well as link to other frequently visited locations.
Office also supports ActiveX (object linking and embedding) Technologies, which means Office files can be
viewed with Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 or a Netscape Navigator plug-in. This enables users to have
powerful tools,  including all toolbars and menus of Microsoft Excel, Word, and the PowerPoint presentation
graphics program, integrated within their browser. Users can also create and save documents in HTML.<p>

<p>

Microsoft says Office 97 and Outlook will ship before the end of the year. Microsoft also released the final
version of Direct 3D, a gaming technology which will allow game developers to create "arcade- quality" games
for Windows 95. More than 30 new games based on Direct 3D are expected by the holiday season. A long list
of the most popular game developers, including<p>

Activision, Sony Interactive Technologies, Sega, Superscape, Viacom, Electronic Arts, Psygnosis, and others,
support the new technology. Along with games, Direct 3D will also provide, what Microsoft calls, a redefinition
of Internet graphics and multimedia.<p>

<h2>Earthseige II </h2>
</b><h3>By Rob Smith</h3>
<b><p>

</b>Earthsiege II (ES2) is the latest entry into the giant robot combat genre, made popular by
Robotech and
Battletech. It is the third such game published by Sierra On-Line, the first two being BattleDrome
and Earthsiege.
As can be guessed from the title, it is the sequel to the original Earthsiege.<p>

<p>

The game is set in the twenty-sixth century and deals with the conflict between human beings and
the Cybrids,
robotic servants/war machines originally built by man. The Cybrids (Cybernetic-Hybrids) were
originally
constructed for use in construction and other heavy work. The military later modified them for
use as weapons
of war.<p>

<p>

Following in the tradition of The Forbin Project, the Terminator movies, and several Star Trek
episodes, the
Cybrids decided that human beings were unworthy of controlling the Cybrid destiny and launched
a war to wipe
out the pesky humans. The fight to liberate the Earth was covered in Earthsiege. <p>

<p>

Earthsiege II covers the Cybrid counterattack, the attempts of the humans to keep them off Earth
and the attempt
to destroy the Cybrids once and for all. (Unfortunately for mankind, this will fail, as there is at
least one more
game planned for the Earthsiege universe, Mission Force: Cyberstorm. It appears to be more of a
tactical game,
such as X-Com. <p>

<p>

Installation of this game went quickly and painlessly. It is a native Windows 95 game and it is
Autoplay enabled.
Just stick the CD in the drive and it will bring up a menu to install or play the game automatically. 
ES2 uses
Microsoft's DirectX drivers and will install them if you do not have them. <p>

<p>

There is not much else to tell. It takes the information from Win95 to set up video drivers,
joysticks and sound
card settings. One quick note...all of the documentation is online, except for a reference card
listing the
commonly used commands. <p>

<p>

You have a couple of different options to play this game. You can play a campaign, which is a
series of linked
missions, or just do a quick one-shot mission which has no bearing on any other missions. The
quick, one-shot
scenarios are fun, but the real meat of this game is the campaign game.<p>

<p>

In addition to piloting your Herc (the name given to the giant robots/tanks that you drive/pilot),
you must also
manage the building and repair of different weapons and Hercs. To get more raw materials, you
have to scavenge
them off the battlefield, therefore you must give great care to taking out Cybrids. It is better to
cripple one and
bring it down, than to utterly destroy it, because the deadly course of action will not give you
more resources
to increase the capability of your forces.<p>

<p>

When you are on a mission, you do so from within the cockpit of the Herc you are piloting. This
will be familiar
to anyone who has ever played Mechwarrior I or  II, ES I or II, Battledrome, or any number of
flight simulators
or car racing games. Here is where you pilot the Herc, select weapons, select targets, give orders
to other
members of squad, and so on. <p>

<p>

You can pilot with either a joystick or keyboard and you can select what controls you want to run
specific parts
of your Herc. You can have the joystick do movement, and control the swiveling of the torso
(think: tank turret)
with the keyboard or vice versa. If you have a joystick with a toggle hat on top, you can use it to
control
movement of the Herc or its torso. <p>

<p>

The one option not available that I would have liked is the ability to use the mouse to swivel the
torso. On the
plus side, it does have an auto-targeting feature, which will center the torso, and hence the guns,
on an enemy
unit. You can then use the normal torso controls to make fine adjustments in your aiming,
allowing to target legs,
or to just plain lead the target so your shots will actually hit it. (This is a necessity when shooting
at flyers, they
move so fast that they are gone by the time your shot gets to them.).<p>

<p>

One of the more interesting Hercs is actually not a humanoid robot, but an attack jet/plane/
skimmer called the
Razor. The controls for this are very simple, similar to that of most WW I flight sims, and it is a
lot of fun to fly
and blast things with. However, you really need a joystick to get any real control with it.<p>

<p>

One of the big complaints with the first Earthsiege was the inability to set the difficulty. That has
now been
changed, with multiple settings available so you should be able to set the challenge to your liking.
Now, for the
good and the bad. Actually, they are much the same thing. ES2 is a gorgeous game, but it requires
some hefty
hardware in order to run it. It can run in either 320x200 or 640x480 resolutions, either in full
screen or even in
a window. Graphically, it puts Mechwarrior II to shame, but it does require more horsepower to
run the game. <p>

<p>

I primarily ran it on a 486DX4-100, and it ran very well in 320x200 with 
all details on maximum. In 640x480,
it still ran pretty well, unless there were a lot of explosions or several Cybrids on screen at the
same time. Flying
the Razor was pretty much impossible at the higher resolution, as the screen updates came only a
couple of times
a second. Please note, this is with all the details set to maximum.  I did run it on a Pentium 120
and ran
everything at high resolution with max detail and the game ran smooth as glass the entire
time.<p>

<p>

Now for the bad news. Performance aside, the only real shortcoming this game has is a lack of
multi-player
options. It has no network or modem support. This is not a real issue for most people, but if you
need it to justify
a purchase, you will not find it here. I do not feel that its lack is sufficient reason to not get this
game and I find
the regular missions rather fun. However, here's hoping multiplayer makes it into Earthsiege
3.<p>

<p>

If you have the hardware and like action games, then  this is a tough one to pass up. I personally
found the
gameplay much more engrossing than Mechwarrior 2, and would recommend this game to anyone
interested in
the giant robot genre or for those who just like to blow things up.

<h2>The Sky's The Limit</b></h2>
<h3>By A. Accetta</h3>
<p>

With the summer months here and later bedtimes for the kids, now is the  ideal for introducing your children to
the wonders of the night sky. The problem is, most of us can't tell the Big Dipper from a whole in the wall.
However, with a little help from your family computer, you can guide your kids through a more extensive
exploration of the stars above, and perhaps even awaken in them a lifelong love for astronomy.<p>

<p>

There's a lot of space exploration software on the shelves of your local software store, but not all of it will help
you prepare for actual outdoor stargazing. There is some observatory software, which turns your personal
computer into a sophisticated (albeit small-scale) planetarium that lets you see how the sky appears at any time
from anywhere on Earth -- including your own backyard. <p>

<p>

Observatory or planetarium software also allows you to output the display to your printer so you can create star
charts personalized for the time and place of your family's stargazing outing. It's probably best if all things
astronomical start off with a bang, so we'll use my favorite planetarium program to make a star chart (and date)
for seeing one of the most exciting events in the summer sky -- the Perseid meteor shower.<p>

<p>

Meteor Magic<p>

<p>

Meteors, or shooting stars, are bits of dust and rock floating in space that fall into the Earth's atmosphere.
Traveling at up to 60 miles per second, they flare brightly before they burn out, leaving long incandescent trails
across the sky. On any dark, clear night, you can see meteors if you look long and hard enough -- you might see
one or two per hour if you're lucky. What makes a meteor shower special is that you can see one or two meteors
per minute. Even the most fidgety kid will sit still for that.<p>

<p>

The Perseid meteor shower lasts about a week and reaches its peak on the night of August 11 or 12. Its radiant
--the point in the sky from which the meteors appear to emanate -- is in the constellation Perseus, which is how
the shower got its name. Unlike some meteor showers, which vary from year to year, the Perseid shower is as
steady as clockwork, making it a dependable attraction year in and year out; so the kids won't be disapointed
by a no-show. To view it, you need to make a star chart that shows where to find Perseus on the night of August
11.<p>

<p>

Make Your Map<p>

<p>

I used RedShift2 to make a star chart my family can use to find Perseus, but there are other programs better
suited to beginning stargazers, such as Astronomer for Windows and Distant Suns -- "First Light." All the
programs work in roughly the same way.<p>

<p>

Enter when and where you plan to view the shower. My family and I plan to view the Perseids while from the
western desert of the U.S. I set my location in the program by clicking n a map (other programs may only let you
pinpoint a nearby city; all let you enter points of longitude and latitude, which you can get from any map). <p>

<p>

After pointing to a location that corresponds roughly to the mid-pont between Tucson and Phoenix, I next
entered the date (August 11, 1996) and time (9:00 p.m.).<p>

<p>

Adjust the display. Like most planetarium programs, RedShift2 has lots of options that add objects to the star
chart that would only confuse things, so you should turn off the display of deep-sky objects, planets, asteroids,
comets, and everything except for stars, constellations, and the horizon.<p>

<p>

Locate Perseus. Next, you use the location function of your program to center the constellation Perseus on your
display. With RedShift2, I access the Find Object menu under Controls, select Constellation, and scroll down to
Perseus. Immediately, RedShift2 centers Perseus on the screen. <p>

<p>

Prepare and print the star chart. You'll want two star charts to help you find Perseus -- one wide-angle view with
little detail to help you get your bearings, and a second, more detailed chart for pinpointing the location of the
meteor shower. For the first chart, you want to see only bright stars, so set the magnitude level to 4 (magnitude
is a measure of star brightness; the brightest stars have magnitudes of -1 and 0, while stars above 6.5 are not
visible to the naked eye). You also want a wide-angle view to orient yourself, so make the view about 120
degrees wide and center it vertically about 30 degrees above the horizon. (With RedShift2, use the Zoom control
to set the zoom factor to .5, and use the Center On control to set the altitude to +30 degrees.) For the close-up
view, set the magnitude filter to 6, the field of view to 60 degrees (zoom factor of 1 in RedShift2), and the
altitude to +15 degrees. <p>

<p>

Once you've printed your star charts, you're ready to view the Perseids.  Now print your star chart. Print copies
for each child as well. Remember, visual effects will help hold their attention during this endevour. The first chart
makes it easy for you to orient yourself, as it identifies the Big Dipper (Ursa Major), the North Star, and
Cassiopeia, the bright constellation shaped like a W just above Perseus. The second chart shows more stars and
gives you a detailed view of the sky near Perseus. The radiant of the shower is close to the point where Perseus,
Cassiopeia, and Camelopardalis meet. Circle this spot on the detailed chart, so you'll know where to focus your
gaze when you're out in the field. <p>

<p>

Tour the Planets<p>

<p>

While you're out viewing the Perseids, you should check out the planets that are visible that night. You can find
out what planets are visible by turning on the display of planets and planet labels from within your program,
changing the view to due south (set the azimuth to 180 degrees in RedShift2) and the field of view to 180
degrees (zoom factor of .3 in RedShift2). This<p>

gives you a view of the sky that includes the ecliptic -- the imaginary line that traces the orbit of the sun against
the background stars. The orbits of all the planets lie close to the ecliptic.<p>

<p>

<p>

Print this display. From the chart, you see that at 9:00 p.m. on August 11, Saturn is just rising in the east, while
Jupiter is high in the sky, directly south. Neptune, Uranus, and Pluto are also up, though these are not visible to
the naked eye. With binoculars, you can make out the four largest moons of Jupiter (the Gallilean satellites) and
a smudge on both sides of Saturn. The smudge is the rings, seen nearly edge on. If you're worried that light from
the moon might interfere with your meteor and planet viewing, you can check its location for August 11.<p>

<p>

A planetarium program is one of the few types of software that are perhaps more fun and useful away from the
computer than they are when you're actually using them. For more fun this summer, invest in a planetarium for
your computer, and enjoy the sights of the universe.<p>

<p>

To work as both an educational tool and an observation aid, a planetarium package must at a minimum let you
enter the date, time, and location you'd  like to go stargazing, let you select where you want to look in the sky
and how wide your field of view will be, and let you print out star charts you can use outdoors.<p>

<p>

RedShift2 (Mac and Windows CD-ROM, $55; Maris Multimedia, 510-933-5630) is my personal favorite; it's
the most comprehensive program I've used. Though it may be a little intimadating for the beginner to use. <p>

<p>

Astronomer for Windows (Windows disk, $14.95; Expert Software, 800-759-2562) is not as comprehensive as
RedShift2, but it makes it easier for beginners to find the things they want. And at less than $15, it is an
inexpensive way to get into astronomy. Expert Software also offers a CD-ROM version of the program for
$19.95 that adds video clips and images of celestial objects.<p>

<p>

Distant Suns -- "First Light" (Windows CD-ROM, $65 street; Virtual Reality Laboratories, 800-829-8754) has
an easy-to-use Aim tool that lets you easily  center the sky display, and it comes up with a list of the planets
currently in the sky whenever you start the program. Best of all for beginners, it hides the Expert menu items until
you feel you're ready for them.<p>

<p>

If you're unsure whether a planetarium program is for you, you can try SkyMap, the best shareware planetarium
program for Windows. If you're using a Mac, check out MP Astro. Both programs are available in the Software
Libraries of  America Online.<p>

<h2>Internet Phone On Packard Bell Platinum PCs</h2>
<p>

PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., 1996 JUL 9 (NB) -- VDOnet has announced that Packard Bell will
include VDOnet's VDOPhone in its new line of Platinum Series PC's. According to the company, this is the first
major personal computer maker to offer video telephony as a standard feature.<p>

<p>

Anyone who purchases a new Packard Bell Platinum Series PC will be able to have video telephone
conversations over the Internet or regular phone lines.<p>

<p>

An early prototype of the VDOPhone was launched in April, enabling anyone with a dial-up modem and regular
phone line to have full-color videophone conversations over the Internet. To date, over 50,000 users all over the
world have connected to VDOPhone.<p>

<p>

Buyers of the Packard Bell Platinum PC will be able to connect to other VDOPhone users worldwide via regular
phone lines and the Internet.<p>

<p>

According to VDOnet, making a VDOPhone call is as simple as sending or receiving an e-mail, enabling any two
PC users worldwide to talk to and see each other in real time.<p>

<p>

"The inclusion of the VDOPhone in a major new personal computer line elevates the potential of the PC as a
communications appliance," said Asaf Mohr, VDOnet's president and chief executive officer (CEO). "Video
telephony now can become a reality among mainstream PC users."<p>

<p>

The VDOPhone uses VDOnet's technology, which offers video compression for use on regular phone lines. It
is optimized for the Internet, since it adjusts to the available bandwidth on-the-fly. The company says that this
is called "bandwidth scalability" and is important because video being transmitted over the Internet needs to be
able to dynamically accommodate changes in bandwidth.<p>

<p>

VDOnet says its bandwidth scalability is a result of two technologies: a scalable compression algorithm that not
only can compress video down small enough to run over the small bandwidth portions of the Internet, and a set
of communications protocols, which maintains the video as it makes its way through the Internet.<p>

<p>

VDOnet is a developer and marketer of products and technology that allow video broadcasting and video
telephony over the Internet, using regular telephone lines and private networks. VDOnet was launched in the fall
of 1995 and has two primary products: VDOLive for Internet video broadcasting, and VDOPhone for Internet
video telephony.<p>

<p>

According to the company, VDOLive is being used by nearly 150 sites to develop video, including sites for PBS,
CBS News, and Paramount Digital Entertainment.<p>

<p>

VDOnet Corp. was founded in 1995 and today has offices in the US and Israel. It has now raised $10 million in
funding from private sources, including Battery Ventures, and NYNEX.<p>

<h2>Philips &amp; Sony To Deliver WebTV Device This Fall</b>: </h2>
<p>

Demonstrating what could be the number one Christmas present in 1996, WebTV Networks debuted a high
resolution, high-speed Internet "experience" displayed on a standard television and a regular phone line.
Philips and Sony, WebTV's first partners, plan to deliver WebTV units this fall.<p>

<p>

While specific pricing has yet to be announced, tentative pricing places a WebTV device in the range of $200.
Phil Goldman, cofounder of WebTV Networks, said, "This is an historic moment for television viewing.
People have talked about Internet appliances, but we have the technology and network for mass consumer
use of the World Wide Web. Existing Internet appliances are PCs with fewer parts."<p>

<p>

What is WebTV? It is a set of technology standards for a hardware device which allows consumers to display
a high-resolution World Wide Web and allows them to "surf" the net. Secondly, WebTV is a subscriber-
based network which organizes the Web in a manner designed to reduce the Web's complexity.<p>

<p>

Users may also choose to use an onscreen keyboard.  John Matheny, manager of systems software at WebTV
Networks, said, "Users can register in just a few moments and be on the Web. WebTV offers full Web
access, e-mail, electronic commerce, storage, MPEG-2 (Motion Picture Experts Group type 2) audio, on a
display designed for living room use."<p>

<p>

Consumers will be able to switch from television programming to the Web and they also will participate in
online commerce through a port on the device which accepts smart Visa and Mastercard cards. These cards
will automatically allow a user to complete purchases across the World Wide Web.<p>

<p>

Addressing one of the main criticisms of Internet appliances, WebTV officials said the Web devices will have
a PC card slot which will allow users to add additional storage and adopt future Internet bandwidth
improvements.<p>

<p>

Steve Perlman, cofounder and president of WebTV Networks, said, "WebTV works better in newer
televisions. but in our office we have a 1963 console television which displays WebTV content."<p>

<p>

The company is also changing the way people connect to the Internet. A user's subscription fee, yet to be
announced, includes Internet access. Users no longer have to choose an Internet service provider (ISP).
WebTV selects the "best" ISP with a local access number and connects users. "We will actually  pick the
ISP," said Perlman. "If one ISP is busy, we will go to another and provide the fastest connection possible."<p>

<p>

Earlier this year. Nintendo hinted that its Nintendo 64 SGI MIPS RISC-based games console will be adapted
for Internet access. Today, Perlman said, "Our MIPS RISC processor-based system will outperform the
Nintendo 64 and transmit data at 33.6 kilobits-per-second." Nintendo had said earlier its processor was faster
than 10 Pentiums.<p>

<p>

Both Sony and Philips plan announcements about their set-top devices in the coming months. Within 18
months, a television set with built-in WebTV access and features is expected to be on the market.<p>

WebTV maintains a Website at http://www.webtv.net<p>

<h2>FormGen Aquired By GT Interactive</h2>
<p>

Taking Duke Nukem's offer to "come get some," GT Interactive has decided to buy Duke's distributor, FormGen,
for a stock swap worth $1 million. <p>

<p>

If you've been following the industry news, you know that FormGen traditionally distributed Apogee's 3D Realms
PC titles, such as Duke Nukem 3D. However, GT Interactive recently obtained the rights to distribute the
Nintendo-64, PlayStation, and Saturn versions of Duke Nukem and a PC expansion disc called Duke Nukem
Forever. The natural question is: why buy FormGen when GT Interactive already has a lock on 3D Realms'
biggest hit? <p>

<p>

"Our first and foremost goal was to increase our publishing business," responds Allyne Mills, GT's vice president
of communications. GT Interactive has always been known as a distributor, but apparently its goal is now to
become a major publisher. "Our strategy is to acquire other publishing studios in various categories in the
industry in order to expand that business," says Mills. <p>

<p>

FormGen is an obvious choice because of its relationship with Apogee/3D Realms and the huge success of Duke
Nukem 3D, but GT Interactive is also attracted to FormGen's publishing experience in the shareware industry.
With this deal, GT also gains the distribution rights to several 3D Realms titles, such as Shadow Warrior, which
were not included in GT's earlier distribution agreement with Apogee that scored the company the console and
PC expansion disc rights to Duke Nukem. <p>

<p>

So what does FormGen gain from the deal? Mills says FormGen will profit from GT Interactive's distribution
power and marketing muscle.  As you may know, GT Interactive is the distributor of recent id Software games,
such as Doom II, Ultimate Doom, and Final Doom. And now, beyond distributing all 3D Realms titles, GT also
has an agreement with id Software to handle the overseas distribution of the full version of Quake and the U.S.
distribution of the sequel (tentatively titled Quake II), which is scheduled to ship in '97. <p>

<p>

"Certainly we're thrilled to be able to publish two of the industry's strongest products in the action category," says
Mills. "But we're publishing for other platforms and categories, including children's titles." <p>

 <p>

GT Interactive is apparently making good on its promise to broaden its publishing power. FormGen is the second
company GT has acquired in as many weeks. It recently bought budget software developer and publisher The
WizardWorks Group for approximately $40 million in stock.<p>

<title>CorelDraw 6 Reviewed</title>
<meta name="CreatedBy" content="WP Internet Publisher 6.1">
</head>
<body><BODY BGCOLOR="#DDD9A2">
<h2><b>CorelDRAW 6  Suite for WINDOWS 95</b></h2><br>
<h3>By A. Accetta</h3>
<hr>
<p>

As a veteran user of CorelDRAW 5, I found it to be a very useful and powerful package of
applications and
utility features that worked well for most, if not all of my graphic needs. When I heard that Corel
was going to
release an new version made exclusively for Windows 95 I anxiously awaited the release of
CorelDRAW 6,
figuring that it would be even better than CorelDRAW 5. After using it for a few months now, I
am very pleased
with it's performance.<p>

<p>

Heralded as the world's premier 32-bit, Windows 95 graphics application, CorelDRAW 6 was to
offer
fully-featured software applications for illustration, photo-editing and bitmap creation, business
and multimedia
presentations 3D rendering and animation; all with the speed and accuracy of 32-bit architecture.
Don't get me
wrong, CorelDRAW 5 was a great program, but after suffering through the many bug fixes (the
version I was
using prior to CorelDRAW 6 was CorelDRAW 5F) and making the switch to Windows 95, I
wanted more from
my graphics package than the 16-bit CorelDRAW 5 could offer. I truly think that CorelDRAW 6,
while not
perfect, lives up to it's claims pretty well.<p>

<p>

The program is more than just a fancy upgrade to CorelDRAW 5. It is a complete revamping of
the product.
Gone, for example, is Corel Ventura, the powerful but clunky and difficult-to-use desktop
publishing program
included in previous versions.  The company has said they will be selling Ventura as a standalone
application in
the near future. Gone also is CorelShow and CorelGraph. They've been replaced by Corel
Presents, a 35mm slide
and electronic screen show application that gives programs like Microsoft PowerPoint and
Harvard Graphics a
run for their money.  In addition to a full-featured graphing and charting module and an excellent
slide-designing
system, Corel Presents offers a host of templates, animation files, and sound effects.<p>

<p>

The program ships as four CD-ROMs packed with four core graphics applications, a squad of
utilities, and
several thousand pieces of clip art, scanned photographs, fonts, and miscellaneous multimedia
files. The full
installation can fill almost 200 MB of disk space (average installation is around 100MB, up from
the 60MB of
CorelDRAW 5). So although every application and feature isn't 100% perfect, the staggering
number of features
makes this one hard-not-like package.<p>

<p>

NEW features in the CorelDRAW 6 suite include 32-bit Architecture that provides support for
long file names,
multi-threading, accuracy to 0.1 micron and MDI (Multi-Document Interface). As a Windows 95
compatible
program, extensive right mouse button support provides easy access to preference setting and
property sheets,
while enhanced support for OLE component software technology helps increase efficiency across
applications.
CorelDRAW 6 is also compatible with many other applications: New import/export filters include
the following:
icons and cursors, PP4, PSD, WVL, FLI and AVI.  The suite also includes more than 80 import
and export
filters that support AI, EPS, PSI (Interpreted), GIF, PCD, all standard bitmap formats such as
PCX, BMP and
TIFF, word 6.0, WordPerfect 6, RTF, PowerPoint, Freelance, Harvard Graphics, FLC, MPG,
WAV and VOC.
A very nice, and much needed, new feature, is the ability to open more than one document at a
time. You can
also drag and drop between Windows or different views of the same document. Corel Color
Management system
has also been enhanced and now includes a Wizard to guide users through the setup.<p>

<p>

Corel has done a good job of optimizing the remaining elements of CorelDRAW 6 for the new
operating system.
The new Windows 95 tab folder-style dialog boxes and roll-ups take a little getting used to but
they are quite
helpful. CorelDRAW 6 supports all Windows 95 functions, such as long file names, as do all the
other programs
in the suite. Best of all, as a 32-bit application, CorelDRAW 6 is a lot faster than its
predecessor.<p>

<p>

As in previous versions, CorelDRAW 6 handles vector drawing while Photo-Paint deals with
image editing.
Since Corel acquired Photo-Paint a few years ago, the program has undergone an amazing
metamorphosis,
becoming an easy-to-use image editing program nearly up to par with Adobe's industry-standard
Photoshop. In
addition to revamping the interface to bring it into the Windows 95 fold, Corel has thrown in a
few new
special-effects filters and a very nice 32-bit core. Photo-Paint has also bolstered its special-effects
capabilities. It
offers more than 70 automated effects, all of which you can adjust via a dialog box. Oddly,
Photo-Paint fails to
apply the effect to hidden portions of the background image or to other objects. So if you move
an object after
applying an effect, you'll reveal an unedited area that appears inconsistent with its surroundings.
And if you can't
freely reposition an object for fear of exposing background abnormalities, you automatically lose
the number-one
benefit associated with floating objects. However, if you remain aware of this problem you can
work around it by
adding the effects to an object and then inserting it in place. <p>

<p>

The old CorelMove has been replaced with Corel Motion 3D, a full-featured and powerful
three-dimensional
animation program. It allows you to create striking animations, such as flying banners or logos,
pulsating bullets,
and about any other graphic you chooses. For creating static three-dimensional graphics,
CorelDRAW 6 includes
CorelDream 3D, a modeling application fashioned after Ray Dream Designer.<p>

<p>

These new applications are more powerful than their predecessors. While Corel does try to retain
some of the
same interfaces and rolldown menus and bars that users found in previous versions, mastering
these new
applications involves more than just learning some new features. The new applications in the suite
look and
operate very differently from the ones they replace.<p>

<p>

Corel does however try to make all of the applications in this suite work similarly to each other.
Tools perform
the same function from application to application. And, best of all, the two most popular
applications in the suite
-- CorelDRAW and Corel Photo-Paint -- work almost exactly the same, apart from a few new
features and the
adaptation to Windows 95.<p>

<p>

One new feature that I really found useful was the Knife and Eraser tools. These utilities let users
slice objects,
cut along an irregular path slice filled objects into closed paths and erase sections of objects.  The
Polygon tool
gives users the ability to easily create live multi-sided objects such as polygons and stars.  Other
new tools
include Panning, Spiral, Graph Paper, Angular Dimension Lines and Connector Lines.<p>

<p>

Corel's "more is better" attitude toward software bundling makes CorelDRAW 6 a tremendous
value. This
upgrade contains a whopping 25,000 pieces of clip art and clip media, including 1,000 full-color
images for use
with Photo-Paint, and more than 1,000 Bitstream TrueType and Type 1 fonts. There are also
several
CorelDRAW 6 and Corel Presents templates along with sample files for both CorelDream 3D and
Corel Motion
3D.<p>

<p>

A complete description of the applications and features that CorelDRAW 6 ships with is included
below:<p>

<p>

The following full-featured applications which are tightly integrated through 32-bit architecture, a
common
interface and Windows 95 features:<p>

<p>

CorelDRAW - A vector-based drawing application.<br>
Corel PHOTO-PAINT - a paint and photo retouching application.<br>
Corel PRESENTS - a NEW business and multimedia presentation application.<br>
Corel DREAM 3D - a NEW 3D modeling and rendering application.<br>
Corel MOTION 3D - a NEW 3D animation application.<br>
<p>

Granted, learning CorelDRAW 6 can be a challenge, and the program gobbles up a lot of
hard-disk space. But
any one of the programs in this suite makes the package worth the $695 list price tag (about $550
average price),
not to mention all those clip art images and fonts. The bottom line is that you won't need any
other image or font
collections;  nor any other graphics programs, for that matter.  Best of all, if you already have a
previous version,
you can upgrade for an unbelievably low price of  $249.<p>

<p>

System Requirements: 486DX2 (66MHz recommended, but I think a low-end Pentium, such as a
75mhz is really
the minimum required);  16MB of RAM; Windows 95; a mouse or tablet; VGA monitor (256
colors
recommended); and a CD-ROM drive (2X recommended, but use at least a 4x if you can). <p>

<h2>More Mac Web File Organizing Tools</h2>
By Tiff Bailey, Internet Road Service<p>

<b><p>

</b>In my last column I wrote about an Internet organizing tool called WebArranger.. Since that time
similar tools have come to my attention. One commercial product and a Hypercard stack.<p>

<p>

The Mac organizing to tool is called GrabNet by The ForeFront Group. It works with a web
browsing application, currently Netscape, to collect and organize Uniform Resource Locators
(URL). There is a 30 day trial version available at <a href="http://www.ffg.com/">http://www.ffg.com/</a>. A permanent edition
costs a reasonable $19.95 plus shipping and handling. It can even be purchased directly on-line via
a credit card and password protected download thus eliminating the shipping and handling
expense.<p>

<p>

The file organizing structure is similar to the Mac Finder, so getting used to GrabNet is easy.
While browsing, GradNet adds an icon to the menu bar that allows access to the program. Each
Web site visited can then be pasted into GradNet via the clipboard. Once GrabNet is up and
running URL's can be "grabbed" and placed in a folder. At the same time, snapshots of web sites
can be captured as well and filed with the text information. After an on-line session, personal
notes can be added to each URL object <b></b>collected with GrabNet. This is helpful because not all
URL addresses indicate the full content of the Web site or what was personally interesting.
Bookmarks from Netscape can be imported to GrabNet for organizing off line and the accessed
again during the next session. The Mac's "Balloon Help" was not incorporated, but there is an
extensive Help Guide available on the menu.<p>

<p>

The Hypercard shareware stack is called, W.W.W URL Sites by Steve Nearman of Virginia. It is
available on America On Line in the hypercard software section. Being shareware Steve expects a
nominal donation of $1 or e-mail on its use. With Hypercard running in the background while
browsing, URL's can be added to the stack by copy and paste. Each card has buttons to add a
new card, copy, print or open the selected URL via a web browsing application. There is also a
field to add notes about the web site. Once in the stack, the URL information is searchable or can
be sorted using the database capabilities of Hypercard. A Mac with limited memory can run
Hypercard in the background at the same time as a browser application.<p>

<p>

Web browsing continues to inspire software developers resulting in another commercial product,
GrabNet, plus a filing tool for Hypercard. <p>

<h2></h2>
<h2>Delorme Software: Take the High Road to Quick Trip
Planning</h2>
Ted Wood<b><p>

<p>

</b>If you've ever been faced with planning a trip you know what a hassle it can be. Getting just the right
maps, the correct route, and finding good places to stay can become a major chore.  Now, thanks to
the clever programmers at Delorme, if you own a computer those problems may just go away.<p>

Delorme has three great software applications that make planning any trip a breeze. With minimal
effort you can plan, organize, and map out your route, side trips, places to stay, and just about
anything else that makes traveling easier. Map 'n' Go, Phone Search USA, and Street Atlas USA are
available for purchase as three separate programs, but together they can work to make an awesome
team.<p>

<p>

Phone Search USA is the simplest of the trio. With Phone Search USA you can look up anyone's (as
long as they're listed in a phone book within the United States) phone number. The search system is
very simple to use, you need only enter a name, address or combination of these and decide what area
of the United States you wish to search. <p>

<p>

The more information you can give the computer, the better your chances of success are. There are
three CD ROM's with this program, each one corresponding to an area of the US, so when you've
decided what area of the US to search, you insert the corresponding CD, hit "Search", and you're
off. The program will find all entries related to the search data you've given it.  <p>

<p>

The search results (if there are any) are displayed on screen in a clean, easy to read format that lets
you select individual items and obtain more information about them. Then, by clicking on the "Map"
button, the program will jump to your copy of Street Atlas USA (if you have one) and begin the
process of locating the specific address on a map. Which brings us to Street Atlas USA. Street Atlas
USA is one of those really great tools that anyone who travels should have around. Simply select the
town or area you'd like a street map of, tell Street Atlas USA to produce a map, and you're instantly
given a clean, full color map of the area. <p>

<p>

This is a great product if you're constantly trying to locate where your client lives or works, and it's
just fun to play with when you're bored. I had a really good time finding all the little towns in upstate
New York and mapping them out. If you're not sure where the town that you're looking for it, Street
Atlas USA has a built in search function (that looks and acts exactly like the one in Phone Search
USA and Map 'n' Go) that's easy to use and incredibly accurate. The mapping tools allow you to
zoom in or out, make notes, and print out your results. If you need to move around the map, you
simply click on a section you'd like a better view of, and the map pans in that direction.<p>

<p>

If you need to plan a trip, Delorme has you covered. With Map 'n' Go, you can plan a trip anywhere
in the US and chart your course with breaks, hotels, and even travel speeds. <p>

<p>

Map 'n' Go has a well thought out toolbar which allows you to find maps by area code, phone
numbers, and zip codes. Choose the "route" icon and you'll begin the process of mapping out your
journey. Simply select your starting and ending points, travel preferences, and set up road speeds, and
let Map 'n' Go do the rest. You can tell Map 'n' Go to chart a course based on the fastest route, the
shortest route, or a preferred/custom route. The custom route is perhaps the most useful form of map
as you can choose which types of roads (toll roads, for example) to avoid, and which types you prefer
to use. The route planner can also be set to reflect your anticipated speeds on each type of road. The
program <b> </b>doesn't care if you want to break the speed limit, so you can set it for a speed that reflects
how you actually drive. Although breaking the speed limit is not recommended , the computer will
still chart your course according to the speed you've chosen. <p>

<p>

Once the computer has created a route for you, it displays it on a larger overview map. From here,
you may zoom in on specific areas and find out about rest stops, accommodations, and other valuable
information. The accommodation data is fairly current and very detailed. It lets you know which
hotels/motels allow pets, serve meals, and more.<p>

<p>

<b>The Test</b><p>

<p>

The only way to really judge a program is to run it through a practical test, and with Delorme's
software, I had a killer test ready. You see, I'll be getting married in Oregon this June, so my fianc&eacute;
and I needed quite a bit of mapping help. My beloved wife-to-be  (Krista) and I set up the tests and
she ran them on the software (to help me get a non-technical person's point of view).<p>

<p>

Firstly, we needed to plan a route across the US (from Troy, NY to Prineville, Oregon). So we set
up Map 'n' Go to plot a route. Well, it made a very interesting plan the first couple of tries. For some
reason it kept setting us up to drive on Route 20 all the way across America. If you've driven Route
20 locally (In Albany, NY) then you know, there's no way you'd want to take it cross country. After
several hours, and a lot of work, Krista finally achieved some measure of success. By breaking the
trip down into smaller sections, and being more detailed about the starting leg of the trip, she finally
managed to create a workable route using Interstate 90. She had also set up a list of hotels to stay
at along the way, and had a travel estimate of 3  days (yes, the software can estimate your travel
time on a given trip!) at sub warp speeds. When we printed the map, it was amazingly detailed and
in gorgeous color. As is to be expected, it took several hours (three to be precise) to print out the
maps, as there were 45 pages of them. I expected as much considering the length of this trip.<p>

<p>

Although a little flustered by her adventures with Map 'n' Go, she still likes it, and I've caught her
tinkering around with our route just for the fun of it. <p>

<p>

The next test was Street Atlas USA's chance to shine. We needed to produce a quality map of the
town (Prineville, Oregon, in case you're wondering) where our wedding is set to be held. Now,
Prineville is a pretty small town and we didn't really expect Street Atlas USA to have much of a map
for it. Were we ever surprised. Not only was the map well illustrated and thoroughly detailed, it was
too detailed for our use. We found that it had ever single street, alley, and side street detailed on the
map. We found no reasonable zoom ratio to work with that would give us the right scale map for our
purposes.  Does that mean we dislike Street Atlas USA?  No, not at all, we actually liked it quite a
bit, it was just that in this one test, it was a little too precise for our needs! <p>

<p>

Lastly came the test for Phone Search USA. We needed to look up some old friends here and in
Oregon. We jumped right in and were amazed at the wealth of information contained on these CD
ROM's. I tried looking up about a half-dozen or so of my old Army buddies and found most of them.
The ones I couldn't find generally had moved quite a bit or had unlisted phone numbers. The Phone
Search USA test was clearly a success.<p>

<p>

Overall, I'd recommend all three of these programs to anyone who has a need for quality, timely
maps, travel information, and phone numbers. Though I would like to know how Delorme plans to
update the Phone Search USA directories at year's end. I'm wondering if they'll have new CD's
available at a discount for previous users, or if we'll be able to download updates somehow (though
these would probably end up being massive and cumbersome files to handle this way).<p>

<p>

<i>System requirements:</i><p>

All three require the following minimum configurations:<b>                               <p>

</b>386SX/33 or faster running Windows 3.1 or higher <p>

4 MB RAM<p>

4 MB Hard Disk Space (3 MB for Map 'n' Go)<p>

Dual Speed (2X) CD ROM<p>

VGA Display<b>                           <p>

   </b><p>

It is recommended that for maximum enjoyment of these programs that you have:<p>

A Microsoft Windows compatible mouse<p>

A color printer<b><p>

<h2>Old Favorites Play Another Round</h2>
By Edward Lansing<p>

Just when you thought you had played the last round of golf with that old Links CD, out comes a
new crop of updated editions to some best-selling PC golf programs.<p>

<i>Golf Tips: Breaking 90</i><p>

Veterans of Golf Tips: Breaking 100 who are ready to shave another 10 shots off their scores can
now put Golf Tips: Breaking 90 in the CD caddy.<p>

As in Breaking 100, you can follow the lessons in order, or visit the various workshops to shore
up specific weaknesses in your game with advice from pros and live-action swing analysis. As
you'd expect, Breaking 90 tackles more advanced topics than its predecessor, including how to
add power to your drive and improve the accuracy of your pitch shots.<p>

$59.95 (Windows 3.1 CD-ROM, Macintosh CD-ROM) from Diamar Interactive, (800)<p>

234-2627, (206) 340-5975. <p>

<b>Links links and more links</b><p>

If you tee up with Microsoft Golf or the Links series of games (both the same game really), you
don't have to play the same holes over and over. Access Software, maker of the Links programs,
has developed add-ons that let you play additional famous fairways. The courses are easy to
install and automatically appear as options at the beginning of the game. Access aims to issue a
new course every 12 weeks; 16 had been released at press time, including Banff Springs, Cog Hill,
Devil's Island, Innisbrook, Mauna Kea, Pebble Beach and Pinehurst. <p>

$29.95 each (DOS and Mac) from Access, (800) 800-4880, (801) 359-2900. <p>

<b>PGA Tour '96</b><p>

Designed to simulate golf as seen on TV, this program comes <b></b>complete with a whispering
announcer, an audience that claps or groans on cue, and a choice of 56 real-life pros who appear
on your PC screen.<p>

$64.95 (DOS CD-ROM) from EA Sports, (800) 245-4525, (415) 571-7171. <b><p>

<h2>NBA Jam Tournament Edition and College Slam
Basketball</h2>
By: T. Accetta<p>

<p>

Hoop lovers will jump for joy with these two very entertaining programs, which let you challenge
a friend or your PC to a full-court game of two-on-two. NBA Jam's graphics are amazing:
On-screen competitors not only look just like real pros, including Patrick Ewing, Grant Hill and
Scottie Pippen, but they also reflect the players' strengths and weaknesses-as an example don't
expect the relatively short Spud Webb to dunk over 7-foot Hakeem Olajuwon.<p>

The setting and action are pretty realistic with the exception of the slam. Players vault over the
hoop as if they had springs in their sneakers, stuffing the ball and landing with twirling,
spinning-even flaming-finishes - is it realistic - No way!. <p>

College Slam substitutes 44 NCAA teams for the pros. There are no identifiable players, but you
can name the athletes yourself and adjust their abilities to emulate real college stars-or to mirror
your own schoolyard skills. You can play a 20-game season with a 16-team elimination
tournament, or cut to the chase with a "Final Four" competition.<p>

Both programs have their share of fun features. If you sink a basket while standing on one of the
court's Hot Spots, you get bonus points. Or, grab a Power-Up icon on the floor to gain special
powers temporarily: One icon boosts speed, while another enhances a player's ability to make
those monster jams. College Slam has a few extra icons, including one that makes your man
invisible, and another that turns him into a Tasmanian Devilish whirlwind.<p>

<b></b>Play improves dramatically if you use a joystick or game pad; a keyboard makes control tricky.
Also, be aware that you may have problems running these DOS games under Windows 95; to
sidestep any potential snafus, use a DOS boot disk.<p>

$54.95 each (DOS CD-ROM) from Acclaim Entertainment, (516) 759-7800. <a href="http://www.att.com/worldnet"></a><p>

<h1>THREE SPORTS GAMES REVIEWED</h1>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>NHL Power Hockey</h2>
NHL Power Play Hockey 96 appears to have everything that a hockey fan would love: NHL
league and tournament play, international competition, statistics in 11 categories, multi player
capability, and very nice graphics. However, appearances can be very deceiving. When you
actually play the game you'll find it doesn't deliver the full hockey experience - but come to think
of it, what sports game actually gives the full "any sport" experience?  On the plus side, you can
play in one of two modes - simple Exhibition <p>

Mode (for novices) or in Season Mode (for experts). <p>

Special key combinations let you control wrist shots, flips, slapshots, pokes, and checks. But
unfortunately you can't bounce your opponents off the boards or send them running for the
nearest dentist with this game; and there aren't any fights (I can hear the purest out there yelling
in unison, "it can't be hockey without the fights"). The sound effects are muffled, and the music's
not very good either (well that's almost like a real hockey game - never really heard much in the
way of great tunes at the rink either).  <p>

Though it's nice looking and playable, Power Play 96 fails to immerse you in the game. For what
it is, mindless entertainment, it's ok as a thing to do when you've got a little free time - but it isn't
realistic hockey plain and simple.  NHL Power Play Hockey 96 for DOS (yes, it will play on
Windows 95 -but it only worked for me when using DOS mode) from Virgin Interactive for $55 <p>

1-800-874-4607<h2></h2>
</b><h2><a href="http://www.att.com/worldnet"></a>Shoot Hoops with the Pros</h2>
Most basketball simulations seem to be all about sprinting up the court and showing off in
uncontested monster jams. NBA Live 96's five-on-five play is far more realistic because it requires
strategy, passing, and play-calling skills to beat the NBA's elite teams. After learning the simple
controls, I was hooping it up with Hakeem Olajuwon, Shaquille O'Neal, and Scottie Pippin.<p>

<p>

Although the court action is fast and authentic, NBA Live 96 falls a few three-pointers shy of
all-star status. The low-resolution animated players look slightly amateurish next to the otherwise
exciting graphics, and I was disappointed by the lack of modem support, which left me with no
option but to play an eternal home-court game. Available on CD for DOS; $59.95 from
Electronic Arts; (800) 245-4525, (415) 571-7171 <p>

<h2>FIFA 96 Soccer</h2>
By: D. J. Haynes<p>

FIFA 96 Soccer is way ahead of the field with it's excellent graphics, smooth gameplay and an
impressive array of options. You can compete at either the pro or semi-pro level; play on dry,
damp or drenched turf; and assemble your squad strategically from hundreds of players with
varying skills and speed. Players are not limited to shooting and tackling, you can have your
teamamtes lob the ball, launch delicate drop passes, rainbow-kick and make other delicate moves.<p>

<p>

The game has two play modes. In action mode, FIFA 96 is a fast-paced arcade game for
experienced and quick hands. Simulation mode slows the action to a more realistic pace-which
gives people with less-nimble fingers a chance to outrun a computerized opponent and pull off
fakes and tackles. You can battle the computer, or four people can play on two PCs connected via
modems or a network.<p>

<p>

FIFA (the Fedration Internationale de Football Association) is the sport's global governing body,
but the program's international accent goes beyond the name: You can play in English, Spanish,
French, Italian, Dutch or Swedish, and match teams from leagues around the globe. The only
thing missing is the fans don't trash the stadium after the game.<p>

<p>

The one problem with the program is that there are just too many options to choose from. Be
prepared to spend some time learning this program inside and out. And memory can trip you up,
too; the game wouldn't work on my PC with 12  MB of RAM, but it ran without a hitch on my
other system that has 16 MB of RAM.<p>

<p>

$49.95 (DOS CD-ROM) from EA Sports, (800) 245-4525, (415) 571-7171. <p>

<h1>75 Seasons: The History of the NFL</h1>
</b>If you're a die-hard football fan, this disc is a natural. The earliest days of the pro game in the
1920s right up to the present day are chronicled in photo, film and statistics all in one action-packed disk.<p>

The program kicks off with black-and-white, grainy newsreel films from the 1920s and '30s, then
traces the league's development right up to today's stunning full-color, slow-motion television
footage. All the legends of the game appear in text, audio and more than an hour of narrated
video, along with the records of teams and players. The names mean almost as much to our
cultural history as they do to the sport itself: Joe Namath, Terry Bradshaw, Jim Brown, Joe
Montana--and, yes, even the pre-"I'm not a murderer", O.J. Simpson.<p>

The program's history lessons are solid: Starting with the roots of the NFL (which began life as
the American Professional Football Association in the early '20s), the program covers every team
to compete in the league, observations about coaching innovations over seven-and-a-half decades,
rules changes, the public's growing fascination with the sport, and the impact of television on its
boom. <p>

But the program scores best with its wonderful video library of football's greatest moments. Over
and over, you can watch Tom Dempsey kick the longest field goal in NFL history (63 yards) or
see Walter Payton break the all-time record for rushing yardage.<p>

This disk is a must have for the football lover in your family or for anyone wanting to be able to
better communicate with someone who is.<p>

$34.95 (Windows CD-ROM, Macintosh CD-ROM) from RealTime Sports, (800) 554-4420,
(212) 395-9800.<p>

<h2>RAM Chip Production Drops</h2>
<p>

A host of major memory chip manufacturers are scaling back production plans for Dynamic RAM chips, the
main memory used in all personal computers, in the hopes of stopping a precipitous drop in prices that has
halved the cost of upgrading PC memory. <p>

<p>

NEC will scale back production of 16-megabit chips from 11 million units a month to 9 million, according to
the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's largest economic daily. <p>

<p>

Prices have hit rock bottom. They really can't go any lower," said a spokesman at L.A. Trade, a memory
reseller in Torrance, California. Prices for 16MB of DRAM four months ago hovered between $300 and
$400, but this amount of memory now sells for as little as $145, said the spokesman. <p>

<p>

And in more good news for the PC-buying public, some PC vendors are also passing on memory price
reductions. A Hewlett-Packard spokesman said that memory prices have "contributed" to its decision to
reduce prices on its desktop PCs. <p>

<p>

Currently, the 16-megabit DRAM chips themselves, which are sold to distributors and PC manufacturers,
trades at just over $15, down from $45 early this year. And supply is still outstripping demand by about 15
percent, according to estimates. <p>

<p>

In the past, NEC, Hitachi, and the other Japanese manufacturers were used to coordinating their production
plans to largely control pricing. But with large Korean manufacturers now in the game, such monopoly has
become more difficult. <p>

<p>

And now fledgling Taiwanese memory manufacturing operations are hoping ramp up to large-scale
production and intensify price competition even more. Some observers believe that this is pushing the
Japanese and Korean manufacturers to cooperate to drive down prices in an effort to stop the Taiwanese from
gaining a foothold in their market.<b><p>

<h2>AT&amp;T Wants To Be Your Internet Provider</h2>
By Danielle Lambert<p>

AT&amp;T's new Internet service is well worth taking a look at, particularly for anyone who already
uses the company as its long-distance provider. But be prepared to be patient. It takes between
four-six weeks to get the CD-ROM version of AT&amp;T's WorldNet Service in the mail. The
company apparently wasn't prepared for the customer response it received after announcing the
service last February. At one point reports from AT&amp;T said that orders for the software were
arriving at the rate of nearly 15 a minute.<p>

Once the disks arrive, installation can move quickly and quite smoothly. That is, it can if you don't
happen to be using another Internet service provider. And the installation program warns quite
clearly that to install WorldNet alongside another ISP running Netscape as an Internet browser
can create conflicts. I quickly found out that warning is accurate. It's strange that this happened
because I regulary have three-five browsers on my system at any one time, Netscape 16-bit,
Netscape 32-bit, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mosaic, etc and have never had any conflicts
before.<p>

<b></b>Not to worry though, there is some relief for this problem. The recommended action is to remove
the version of Netscape you have running and to install WorldNet with its Netscape version.
However, there is an option to keep your present provider and install AT&amp;T's program with a
work around so you can run both systems at the same time. It involves changing the command
line for my service provider's icon in Windows so there is no conflict between the two Netscapes.<p>

I called WorldNet's "800" technical-assistance number to clarify the changes I needed to make.
The hold time before a person answered was about 10 minutes, less than I expected for the
volume of calls they were reportidly receiving.<p>

After that minor problem was fixed, installation did go quickly and smoothly. In addition, to
WorldNet access, you get Eudora Lite for e-mail and some online instruction manuals for
Netscape and Eudora. There also is an online-registration process that requires a credit-card
number.<p>

Signing onto WorldNet and using Netscape presented no initial surprises, except, perhaps, the
speed of the response. Even graphics-heavy World Wide Web pages loaded reasonably quickly.
And jumping to other WWW sites didn't slow the system (I was using a 28.8k modem). However,
on several occasions, the connection was broken and the program redialed the WorldNet's
number. <p>

When I called tech assistance, holding fewer than five minutes this time, I was told that sometimes
the server gets overloaded and drops a connection. It seems to be a transient problem, because the
past few times I logged on,there were no recurrences.<p>

WorldNet's Netscape comes loaded with bookmarks, so you can jump to a variety of Web pages.
I could probably do without most of them, but it's interesting to see what AT&amp;T thinks I might be
interested in.<p>

<p>

If you don't want to use WorldNet's browser, you can use your own after the program is installed.
However, tech service won't support any except the original.<p>

AT&amp;T residential long-distance customers who sign up before Dec. 31 get five free hours a
month for a year. You might want a stopwatch beside your computer, because there is no way to
tell, short of calling AT&amp;T WorldNet, how much time you have been online.<p>

AT&amp;T residential customers also can upgrade to unlimited access for $19.95 a month. If you
aren't an AT&amp;T customer, the unlimited access is $24.95. To subscribe, call 800-WorldNet.<p>

While I am still partial to my local service provider, with which I've suffered through at lot of
frustrations, I think AT&amp;T may deserve at least a try. One good point about AT&amp;T is that you
can live anywhere, even if you move, and still keep the same provider.<p>

<h2>The Lusty Month of May</h2>
By Tiff Bailey, Internet Road Service<b><p>

<p>

</b>May and June bring graduation events for high school and college students. One of the things
students lust after is a computer. National sales of computers have slacked off making retailers and
mail order houses suggest some terrific buys. My advise is to buy a Macintosh with at least 8 Megs
of Ram, a 28.8 Modem, with the largest hard drive and as much pre-loaded software as you can find.
However, for the student the best advice might be to wait.<p>

<p>

For the college bound student the college bookstore may offer the best deal. Some colleges include
a computer as part of the tuition as it is expected that papers and home work will be submitted to the
professor via the school's network. Indeed, many technical schools offer on-line tutorials anytime of
the day or night. A computer in the dorm room makes it possible avoid long walks to the computer
resource area. At test time there may not be enough PC's for all the students, especially during
daylight hours. Distributed computing via networks and PC's have eliminated the batch processing
on the school's main frame of yesteryear. This trend is evolving to the use of notebook size computers
taken to classes for recording notes or laboratory work. Even the college graduate may find the
bookstore the best place to buy  a computer before heading to real world.<p>

<p>

<p>

Most colleges are connected to the Internet which, as minimum, allows sending and receiving e-mail
from home. It is easy to dash off a note about family events rather then finding a pen, paper, envelope
and stamp. In return parents will get the usual plea, "send money" a lot faster.<p>

<h2>And Now For Something Completely Different...</h2>
<p>

World's First Official Monty Python Website. Your wwwone-stop wwwarehouse for .comedy and
wwwit.<p>

Starting June 36th, you and your loved ones will finally have the chance to enjoy authentic and
healthy Monty Python a la modem. And you can be assured that this time it's the real thing; not
that imitation Python full of additives and preservatives that's been floating around cyberspace for
years. That's because PythOnline, unlike other Python websites, is the first to have the approval
and participation of the Monty Python members themselves (like Eric Idle, who is the project's
spiritual leader and one of the taller original Python members).<p>

"I'm looking forward to getting this website up and running," says Idle. "Finally we (Monty
Python) will be able to have some control over the quality and accuracy of information about us
(Monty Python) that's put out there (on the Web, not Monty Python). It'll be good for us (Monty
Python) as well as everyone else looking for a new and dependable Python (Monty) source."<p>

To create the site, Monty Python has joined forces with 7th Level.  7th Level has already
developed two CD-ROM games with Monty Python - the award-winning Monty Python's
Complete Waste of Time and Monty Python and the Quest for the Holy Grail, which will be
available in July.<p>

In addition to featuring all your favorite classic Monty Python sketches, characters, film bits and
music, PythOnline will be bursting at the seams with new comedy, characters, games and gags.
And since this will be the only official Python website, never-before-seen material from Python
members, as well as any new material they might be working on, will be posted for the pleasure of
Python fans. And don't forget the vast compilation of fascinating Python trivia that will be
available on this site, and this site alone.<p>

Of course PythOnline will serve all your Python shopping needs, offering the most comprehensive
selection of desirable and somewhat less than desirable Python memorabilia. And because Python
fans are notoriously cheap, the store will afford them the opportunity to create a personal wish list
of items that other people can purchase for them.<p>

What's more, every PythOnline visitor will be given the chance to join the Spam Club - their
passport to the inner circle of everything Python. In addition to countless other benefits, each
Spam Club member will receive regular updates on what's happening in the world of Monty
Python, what new projects are in the works, and, as a special treat, will be granted access to
secret pages of the website not available to the general public. (And maybe get to see some
naughty bits.)<p>

Although PythOnline prides itself on being the only truly certifiably official Monty Python
website, other Python sites, if deemed worthy, are eligible to receive the official Python seal of
approval, and will be invited to become a part of the effort to purify Python consumption for
everyone.<p>

<p>

So don't be shy. We're really quite nice. Whether you're a net surfer, a net bather, a net wader, or
just a screaming, little net sissy-who's-afraid-of-the-water, come visit PythOnline. Starting June
36th. Please mark it on your calendar and be sure to check it out as long as "you're not dead yet!"<p>

<h2>The Thrill Is Here: On the Road with B.B. King</h2>
I've always liked the way B.B King, gravely throat and all, makes music. There's something about
the way he plays his guiter (named Lucille) and the song "The Thrill is Gone" that always got me
dancing. Now you can learn more about Mr. King and his music with this interactive CD-ROM.
Strolling down memory lane with legendary bluesman B.B. King is a lot like spending an evening 
with a favorite uncle. In his new "interactive autobiography," On the Road with B.B. King, the
musician reminisces about the good old days, talks about beloved family members and old friends,
laughs at himself-and occasionally tells fans something that they didn't already know.<p>

The disc takes us to some of B.B.'s favorite haunts, both real (his hometown of Indianola, Miss.;
Beale Street in Memphis; and B.B. King's Blues Club in Los Angeles) and imagined (Lucille's, a
"cybermuseum" named after King's guitar; and the Airport, where you'll take off on guided aerial
tours of cities that have special significance in King's life). All five areas contain colorful paintings
from African-American artists; the images conveying the essence and energy-if not the exact
look-of each place.<p>

Unfortunately, the road doesn't last forever; in fact, the entire journey ends after just a couple of
hours. At all the locations, you'll see a slide show and hear King tell you, briefly, about the people
or places. Occasionally, he'll share a longer story-like the time he and his buddies borrowed his
father's Buick to get to a gig and ended up wrecking the car. But mostly, each slide passes by with
minimal detail: "This is the church where I used to sing with the quartet. It was a great place to be
on a Sunday. Nothing like it."<p>

Still, King is a jovial companion-even when he's recalling low times, such as his grueling work on
a plantation-and his many fans will savor the tour while it lasts. The CD-ROM may not be any
sort of landmark in new media, but for better or worse, it does adhere to one old-time
show-business axiom: Always leave 'em wanting more.<p>

$39.95 (Windows 3.1 CD-ROM, Macintosh CD-ROM) from MCA Interactive, (970) 339-7309. <a href="http://www.att.com/worldnet"></a><p>

<h2>Search Tools For Finding Web Sites</h2>
<p>

I'm sure you've all surfed the net and used many of the various search engines that catalog web
sites, but here's a brief list any way. Search engines make it easier for us to find a site or sites with
the information we are looking for. They are the travel guides of the web and without them we
would just be fumbling around with no way to really know what sites were out there. All of these
services are free once you're on the Web. They all perform the same function, but they do have
subtle differences.<p>

<p>

All4one Search Machine  (<a href="http://www.easypage.com">http://www.easypage.com</a>) Type in a request and it's sent to four
search engines--Alta Vista, Lycos, WebCrawler and Yahoo; the results are displayed on a single
page on your screen.<p>

<h1>Job Hunting on the Web</h1>
With College out, and many graduates looking for a place to earn enough money to start paying
those student loans back we offer these four helpful web sites (which will link you to many other
useful sites).<p>

<b>The Business Job Finder </b><p>

Address:<a href=" http://www.cob.ohiostate.edu/dept/fin/osujobs.htm"> http://www.cob.ohiostate.edu/dept/fin/osujobs.htm</a><p>

<h2>Help For Your Small Business/Home Office</h2>
</b><p>

Here are a few web sites that are helpful for the small business/home office user (and also the
home computer user). <p>

<p>

<i>FREE Software for the downloading:</i><p>

<p>

Jumbo: Address:<a href=" http://www. jumbo.com"> http://www. jumbo.com</a><p>

The best shareware/freeware library in cyberspace. Why? Jumbo's easy-to-use search tool helps
you find what you need in the nearly 50,000 files in categories such as business, education,
graphics, and games. A brief description of each file is included. The files actually reside on
servers around the world; Jumbo acts like a giant switchboard to give you links to all the sites
holding the particular program. Select the site closest to you for the speediest download.<p>

<p>

Windows95.com: Address: <a href="http://www.windows95.com">http://www.windows95.com</a><p>

Its selection of freeware isn't quite as comprehensive as Jumbo's. Nevertheless, Windows95.com
is worth a visit, primarily for its innovative interface that includes Windows-style icons and a
Taskbar. <p>

<p>

Microsoft : Address: <a href="http://www.msn.com">http://www.msn.com</a><p>

If you want free Microsoft software, head to the company's Web site. The Windows software
library is well organized, with a separate section for downloading Microsoft Office macros, the
Internet Explorer 2.0 Web browser, and the new 3.0 Beta version, utilities such as the Microsoft
Word Technical Dictionary, and a self-running Microsoft Office for Windows 95 demo.
(Microsoft Network users should head here, too. MSN itself is sadly lacking in comparable
content.) <p>

<p>

Netscape Navigator 2.0.  With advanced features such as framing and progressive rendering of
graphics, and with more proprietary extensions than its competitors can offer, Netscape Navigator
2.0 is the best Internet browser available.<p>

<p>

Tapping into this extra power, many companies have used Netscape server tools to create their
Web sites. In fact, "Netscape Enhanced" has become a common sign along the information
superhighway. (free trial version at<a href=" http://www.home.netscape.com"> http://www.home.netscape.com</a>)<p>

<p>

<i>Business related sites:</i><p>

<p>

MarketPlace: Address: <a href="http://www.mktplace.com">http://www.mktplace.com</a><p>

At this site, MarketPlace hands over some of Dun and Bradstreet's valuable data. For instance,
you can do a market analysis of practically any industry in the United States, obtaining detailed
information that includes market share, company size, and geography. Or use the Marketing
Services Directory to search for businesses by zip code--say, public relations services--and get
back a list of companies located in your area. <p>

<p>

Small Business Administration: Address: <a href="http://www.sbaonline. sba.gov/index.html">http://www.sbaonline. sba.gov/index.html</a><p>

The U.S. Small Business Administration has an amazingly comprehensive Web page supplying not
only a hot list of government links but also more than 500 freeware, public domain, and shareware
business programs. If you're just starting out in business, check out the online Gopher site
workbook, the Business Plan Road Map to Success. The site also supplies electronic Small
Business Administration loan application forms, plus a ranking of commercial banks by state and
lending activity.<p>

<p>

Government Printing Office Access: Address: <a href="http://www. access.gpo.gov/index.html">http://www. access.gpo.gov/index.html</a><p>

Take advantage of the dazzling array of free databases available from the feds. With over a dozen
Federal Depository Library gateways, this site allows keyword searches on, say, the 1995 and
1996 Federal Register and Congressional Record, Government Accounting Office reports,
Privacy Act Notices, and other documents. Want to see what the government has to say about
software and foreign affairs? Find out with GPO Access's  Government Information Locator
Service, a search engine that gets data from over 20 agencies, including the Office of Management
and Budget, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission, to
name a few. <p>

<p>

<i>Virus detection programs:<p>

</i><p>

One top antivirus choice is F-Prot Professional--it's fast, accurate, and free. F-Prot runs from
DOS or Windows and intercepts viruses before they wreak havoc. Get your copy at<p>

<h2><u>TECHNOLOGY NEWS AND TRENDS</u></h2>
<b><p>

UNIVERSAL COMPUTER:</b> Saying "this is not a P.C" but rather "an appliance that is
dramatically cheaper and easier to use," Oracle CEO Larry Ellison heralded the "network
computer" (a cheap and simple alternative to personal computers) as "the first step beyond
personal computing, to universal computing."  Oracle has announced technology partnerships
with a group of about two dozen companies, including Mitsubishi, Nokia, Acer, Motorola,
Digital, Cirrus Logic and Corel, that will either manufacture or contribute hardware or software
components to a network computer, designed to receive its applications software from the
network on an as-needed basis.  IBM and Sun are expected to join Oracle and Netscape in an
endorsement of standards for the network computer.  (New York Times 16 May 96 C2)<p>

<p>

<b>AGRICULTURE NETWORK SOWS SEEDS OF SUCCESS</b>: Forty chemical and agricultural
companies are teaming up to develop an intranet and secure Web site that will allow subscribers
to access to databases on regulatory and industry issues, conduct electronic data interchange
(EDI), and perform electronic funds transfer (EFT) over the network.  The PowerAg Network
will also provide full access to the Internet. Web site will enable agricultural chemical companies
to manage inventory more efficiently, reducing an annual overproduction of $1.5 billion worth of
tightly regulated chemicals.  "It's eating the industry alive," says the president of the consortium
sponsoring the effort.  (Information Week 6 May 96 p42)<p>

<p>

<b>IBM IN HOME BANKING:</b> IBM is working with 10 large financial institutions to form a
company to provide a complete home-banking service.  INET, as the venture is tentatively called,
would compete directly with banking services offered by Microsoft and Intuit.  (Wall Street
Journal 15 May 96 B6) <p>

<p>

<b>ELECTRONIC BANKING COULD BE BIG BUSINESS:</b> A new study by San Francisco-
based Killen &amp; Associates predicts electronic transaction revenue growing to more than $10
billion by the year 2000.  The company suggests that rather than just concentrating on the
payment side of electronic commerce, however, banks and others should help merchants with
order fulfillment and shipment -- markets that are still up for grabs. (Investor's Business Daily 16
May 96 A8)<p>

<p>

<b>AOL TEAMS UP FOR E-COMMERCE:</b> America Online has cut deals to license encryption,
digital signature, and electronic transaction and funds transfer technologies from a variety of
companies, including CyberCash, IBM infoMarket, RSA Data Security, Terisa Systems and
VeriSign.  "These new relationships will provide the building blocks for a secure electronic
commerce platform," says AOL's VP of product marketing.  The online service plans to integrate
the electronic commerce technologies into both its online service and its Global Network
Navigator Internet access service.  (Investor's Business Daily 16 May 96 A9)<p>

<p>

<b>INTERNET IN AFRICA: </b>Speaking by satellite to a conference in Johannesberg, U.S. vice
president Al Gore announced a five-year program to improve Africa's access to the Internet. 
Details of the program, estimated to cost about $15 million, are being finalized.  Ollivetti CEO
Carlo di Benedetti told the conferene: "The developing world now has a rare opportunity to make
a quantum leap ... to close the gap between rich and poor, not through traditional industrial-sation, but by joining at the same level in exchange of skills and know-how."  (Financial Times 15
May 96)<p>

<p>

<b>HITACHI PLANS TO SHAKE UP LAPTOP MARKET:</b> Hitachi Ltd. is launching its new
notebook line this week, with machines built for connectivity (the C series) priced between $2,000
and $4,000, and multimedia machines (the M series) costing from $2,400 to $5,500.  One way
they plan to differentiate themselves is by cutting their product update cycle to six months:  "What
we're saying is that every six months we will do major launches.  The market is going to be
shocked by that.  Everybody has talked about bringing it down from a year to nine months.  But
we're bringing it straight down to six months,"  says Hitachi PC's CEO. (Investor's Business Daily
15 May 96 A6)<p>

<p>

<b>NINTENDO'S NEXT- GENERATION VIDEO GAME MACHINE</b>: Nintendo's new 64-bit
video game player will be available in the U.S. this fall for about $250, with performance levels
substantially higher than those possible on current personal computers.  With industry analysts
expressing skepticism that standalone single-player game players will prove competitive against
multi-player gaming via the Internet, Nintendo of America chief executive Howard Lincoln
responds:  "Like everyone else in the Industry we have an Internet strategy, but we can't say what
it will be yet."  (New York Times 16 May 96 C1)<p>

<p>

<b>NOVICES NEED NOT APPLY, SAYS PSINET:</b> PSINet will gear its online access service
toward experienced users rather than the mass market, citing the expense of providing customer
support to computer novices.  "We're going to no longer serve the low-end consumer," says the
companies CEO.  "We were not making money at that part anyway.  If AT&amp;T gives away training
to 80 million customers, we'll take their graduates.  I can make a billion-dollar company on their
crumbs." (Investor's Business Daily 13 May 96 A7)<p>

<b><p>

APPLE TO TAKE "SMALL STEPS" FOR MANKIND</b>: Declaring that his company is at a
crosswords where one path will lead it to a "decline into irrelevancy" while the other path will
return it to its mission of "changing the world," new Apple CEO Gilbert F. Amelio used his first
public strategy speech to promise a series of "small steps" that he says will restore the company to
its former prosperity.  As part of Amelio's new plan, Apple will focus on "megatrends" (such as
the Internet and multimedia products and services) and will refocus and simplify its product lines,
which will now be reorganized around four product groups: the Macintosh computer line;  the
"information appliance" business comprising products under $1000;  printers and modems;  and
the Advanced Technology Group devoted to "alternative platforms" such as the CHRP ("common
hardware reference platform") computer that Apple co-designed with IBM.  (New York Times 14
May 96 C1)<p>

<p>

<b>PRODIGY SOLD FOR $250 MILLION</b>: IBM and Sears have sold their Prodigy online service
for around $250 million to an investor group, recruited by Prodigy's current management team.
Mexico's Grupo Carso, owner of telephone giant Telefonos de Mexico, is part of the International
Wireless Inc. purchasing group.  (Wall Street Journal 13 May 96 B2)  Prodigy management will
retain their jobs under the sales agreement, and have voiced plans to concentrate on
Internet-related services and global marketing.  "The new Prodigy is going to be the world," says
Prodigy's CEO.  (Investor's Business Daily 14 May 96 A8)<p>

<p>

<b>NETWORK COMPUTER STANDARDS CLOSE TO AGREEMENT</b>: IBM, Oracle and Sun
Microsystems are working up technical specifications for a class of low-cost Internet appliances
that can be used to tap into the Web.  The new specifications will be licensed to any appliance
maker who wants them.  The joint effort is seen as a strategy to avoid a scenario where one
company overwhelmingly dominates the market, as is the case with Microsoft and PC operating
systems.  The technical standards will make it easier for software firms to write applications
programs, and will allow manufacturers to use a variety of operating systems or microprocessors,
so long as they work with Sun's Java.  (Wall Street Journal 13 May 96 B2)<p>

<p>

<b>BREWER TURNS BROKER</b>: Spring Street Brewing Co. soon will be cooking up deals instead
of hops, says company founder Andrew Klein.  After an initial foray into online stock trading a
couple of months ago when Klein <b></b>was granted SEC approval to offer Spring Street shares for sale
via a Web site, Klein now plans to "build the world's first investment bank and brokerage firm
dedicated to arranging the public offering of securities through the World Wide Web."  His new
entity, Wit Capital Corp., will offer businesses "an array of financial advisory services" and "will
act as an agent on the public offering of securities through the Internet."  (BNA Electronic
Information Policy &amp; Law Report 12 Apr 96 p15)<p>

<p>

<b>MORE COMPUTERS = MORE PAY?</b> A study by two professors at the Wharton School
indicates an inverse relationship between workers' and managers' use of computers and pay scales.
When managers' use of computers doubled, the workers' salaries increased by 3% annually. 
Conversely, when employees' computer use doubled, managers' pay rose by 3.5%.  The latter
results suggest that when computers are introduced into a company's operations, managers are
freed from some types of work and are able to take on more complicated duties, which often
increases their salaries.  (St. Petersburg Times 13 May 96 p13)<p>

<p>

<b>PCs IN EUROPE COST 34% MORE</b>: A new report from IDG Group says that after taxes, PC
prices in Europe average 34% higher than the U.S. for the same machine.  Still, sales are expected
to continue to rise, with an anticipated 6.4 million units sold this year, up from 5.4 million last
year.  (Investor's Business Daily 14 May 96 A9)<p>

<p>

<b>NEW CHIP FOR HIGH-SPEED COMMUNICATIONS:  </b>IBM and Hughes are planning to
use a new microchip combining silicon and germanium to develop extremely high-speed analog
communications products, such as a small radar system that could be installed in automobiles to
help prevent collisions.  (New York Times 13 May 96 C6)<p>

<p>

<b>MORE MAC CLONES:</b> Several Taiwanese firms are gearing up to produce Macintosh clones,
giving a boost to Apple efforts to build market share.  Umax Group began shipping its high-end
clones this month, with systems based on the 150-MHz and 180-MHz PowerPC chips, and IBM's
recent agreement to license the Mac operating system will allow it to sublicense MacOS to two
Taiwanese system makers. IBM doesn't plan to build the machines itself, but hopes that bundling
the Mac software with its PowerPC chip will encourage other component makers to comply with
the PowerPC platform, freeing clone makers from exclusive reliance on Apple for parts. 
(Information Week 6 May 96 p24)<p>

<p>

<b>APPLE WILL FIX FLAWED MACHINES:</b> Acknowledging defects in many of its Macintosh
Performa and Power Mac computers, Apple Computer has pledged to repair any faulty machines
over the next seven years.  Users have complained that the systems freeze up, and some of the
monitors change color intermittently.  The company also said it will fix problems found in some of
its Power Book laptops.  (St. Petersburg Times 9 May 96 E1)<p>

<p>

<b>SENATE ELECTRONIC COPYRIGHT BILL BACK ON TRACK:</b> Legislation on
copyright rules for the Internet, sponsored by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), is scheduled for
hearings and Hatch has made it clear he wants the bill to "move ahead."  The bill would make any
electronic copy of copyrighted material an infringement, and does not include a fair use provision
for libraries or educational institutions.  The Creative Incentive Coalition, a group of software
makers, publishers and entertainment companies, is supporting the bill, warning that without
protection, content providers will be reluctant to put material on the Internet.  The Digital Future
Coalition, on the other hand, opposes the legislation, saying it goes too far when compared with
protections for analog material.  "A few horror stories are not an appropriate guide to public
policy...  There is middle ground."  The DFC is urging specific amendments, including fair use
specifications, and  a statement that makes clear that a temporary copy of a program running on a
computer is not an infringement.  (Investor's Business Daily 9 May 96 A4)<p>

<p>

<b>COMPUSERVE &amp; NETSCAPE TO OFFER GROUPWARE:</b> CompuServe and Netscape are
joining forces to use the Internet to offer "groupware" that will allow workers throughout an
organization collaborate simultaneously on documents.  The product will compete directly with
Lotus Notes, a groupware program offered by IBM's Lotus group.  (Wall Street Journal 9 May
96 B5)<p>

<p>

<b>PEACE PIPE FOR MICROSOFT AND ADOBE:</b> After feuding for more than five years,
Microsoft and Adobe Systems have decided to collaborate on type font technology, and are now
working on a universal format called OpenType.  Both companies hope that others will back their
efforts to make OpenType the standard for software and the Internet. (Investor's Business Daily 9
May 96 A8)<p>

<p>

<b>NET MCTRIVIA:</b> Shortly after the McDonald's fast food chain began a $1 million-prize trivia
contest last month, answers started appearing on the Internet.  About a dozen Web sites have
sizable answer lists to the contest, for which prizes are being redeemed through May.  One
teenage McWebmeister explained: ''Everyone here in the office was playing the game. It was a big
deal for people to try to remember the answers.  The more I thought about it, the more I thought
what a great Web page, and the next thing I know I've got hundreds of people coming to my page
every day.''  (San Jose Mercury Center News 9 May 96)<p>

<p>

<b>WEB RATING SYSTEM UNVEILED:</b> The long-awaited PICS (platform for Internet content
selection)  system is now functional, allowing parents to screen and block content they deem
unsuitable for their children.  Thirty-nine Internet-related companies plan to offer their customers
software that enables them to filter out pages according to their own choice of tolerance level for
violence, sex, nudity and language.  Web page sponsors can get their sites rated, on a scale of
zero (innocuous) to four ("X-rated"), by filling out an electronic questionnaire.  Parents can set
the level at which content will be blocked and can also block all unrated sites.  A password gives
parents access to those areas they've blocked for their children.  (Investor's Business Daily 10
May 96 A18)<p>

<p>

<b>MICROSOFT &amp; NBC PLAN TO MARKET THE NEWS: </b>"The future of TV news is
personalized -- it's giving users the ability to draw on a huge source of information that will cater
and be customized to personal interests," says the president of NBC Cable.  To achieve this new
vision, NBC is developing a "circle of cross promotion" for MSNBC, the new venture between
Microsoft and NBC.  "MSNBC is very much a marketing vehicle. It's a conscious way to use the
brand power of a TV network to drive people to become online users and the online service to
become a regular part of the way people use television."  (Broadcasting &amp; Cable 6 May 96 p43)<p>

<b>STUDENT CHARGED WITH ONLINE CHILD PORNOGRAPHY:</b> A student at Adelphi
University in Long Island, New York, has been charged with using a university computer to
retrieve (from computers in Sweden and the Netherlands) photos of children engaged in  sex acts
and to retransmit the photos to people in the U.S. who requested them.  The charge of promoting
the sexual performance of a child is a felony and is subject to punishment by up to seven years in

<b>PENTIUM PRO PC PRICES POISED TO PLUNGE:</b> A senior Intel official predicts deep
cuts in prices for computers powered by Intel's top-of-the-line Pentium Pro microprocessor, from
an average of  $4,000 now to about $2,500 by the end of the year.  This trend is expected to
spark a new round of corporate upgrading, augmented by new Intel motherboard and chip set
technology that are both cheaper and easier to maintain than <b></b>current models.  The new
technology, called Desktop Management Interface, uses hardware and software standards
designed to facilitate remote diagnosis of PC problems and reduce repair and maintenance costs.

$500 INTERNET PC WON'T FLY, SAYS FORRESTER</b>: A new report released by Forrester
Research predicts that the $500 Internet PC "won't deliver" and aren't cheap enough to qualify as
a successful consumer electronics product.  "The technology is not good enough, the content will
be inadequate, and distribution will pose a substantial hurdle."  Forrester says that low-cost
full-feature PCs priced in the $1,000 range will present a more viable alternative.  (Investor's

<b>THE PC'S A PRINTING PRESS, NOT A TV:</b> Jonathan Wallace, co-author of "Sex, Laws and
Cyberspace," (Henry Holt, 1996) thinks Congress made a mistake in its attempt to ban "indecent"
content from the Internet:  "If Congress had taken a deep breath, it would have realized the
correct analogy for the Net is the printing press.  Every computer can be used as a tool to create
text or redistribute text created by others.  The analogy is so exact that there's no justification to
apply laws that are different than those for the printing press.  What Congress did instead was to
treat the Net like broadcast TV -- a grievous mistake." (Information Week 29 Apr 96 p12)  The
Communications Decency Act is now being challenged in court by the American Library
Association, whose legislative counsel Adam Eisgrau notes, "Fear plus ignorance shouldn't equal
public policy."  (Business Week 6 May 96 p58)<p>

<b>"THE FLOPPY IS OBSOLETE TECHNOLOGY"</b>: Kim Edwards, CEO of
removable-disk-drive-maker Iomega, says the days of the floppy drive are over:  "We believe that
the floppy disk is essentially obsolete technology.  It isn't big enough to do anything with, and it's
very, very slow.  Software is all shipped on CD-ROM.  In fact, it's really shipped on the hard
drive.  Gateway 2000 Inc., for example, preconfigures their machines with software right on the
hard drive.  Microsoft Crop. has announced that they're going to stop providing software on
floppies.  I think that's a huge signal.  But to make the Zip the floppy for the multimedia age,
we're going to have to do more than just sell the drive as an external box.  We've got to get inside
the computers."  The Zip drive, which sells for $200, uses special removable disks that hold 100
megabytes of data, compared with 1.4 megabytes on a conventional floppy.  Iomega's Jaz drive
stores one gigabyte on each disk.  (Investor's Business Daily 6 May 96 A6)<p>

<b>IBM LICENSES APPLE MAC/OS:</b> IBM has worked out an agreement to license Apple
Computer's Macintosh operating system, and although it doesn't plan to manufacture Mac clones
itself, IBM will be allowed to sublicense the system to other computer makers and will be able to
offer hardware components, such as the PowerPC chip and motherboards, to other clone
manufacturers.  "This will help Apple expand the low end of the market... where they've had
problems," says an industry analyst.  A similar agreement with Motorola, signed in February, will
allow Motorola to make and sell its own Mac clones as well as sublicense the system.  (Investor's

<h2>Old Time Baseball</h2>
By: Bill Franklin<p>

Ever wonder how Babe Ruth would fare against Nolan Ryan? The 69 Mets against any of the
legendary Yankee teams of yesteryear? Old Time Baseball's  arcade-style game lets any two
teams that played between 1871 and 1981 square off, and you can swap any of the 12,000 players
from those years to create dream matchups. <p>

The game's sheer beauty and consistent attention to detail is its main attraction; from the authentic
uniforms and billboards in the outfield, to the play-by-play of legendary announcers Curt Gowdy
and Mel Allen, to the encyclopedia's worth of information on players. One of Old Time Baseball's
best features is the ability is to play some of baseball's great moments, such as the 1944 World
Series featuring the two St. Louis teams. You get to play these games in really cool digital
versions of 16 legendary ballparks, most of which have long since been demolished by the
wrecking ball.<p>

The game needs 8 megabytes (MB) of RAM.  $59.95 (Windows 3.1 CD-ROM) from Stormfront
Studios, (800) 245-4525, (415) 479-2800. <b><p>

<td>

The founder of Boehringer Ingelheim, Albert Boehringer, was born in Stuttgart. He founded the company on July 31,1885, in Ingelheim am Rhein. The first products manufactured by a crew of 24 employees were cream of tartar and tartaric acid. The latter was used for baking powders and fizzy lemonades. The first pharmaceutical

that was developed, was Laudanon, a painkiller, with a composition of six different opium alkaloids.

After the good results of last year the most successful year ever in the history of the Company 



 Boehringer Ingelheim was able to improve even further upon that success in 1995. In spite of the 



adverse trends of almost every currency of relevance to Boehringer Ingelheim compared with the DM, 



on account of which some of the expectations for the past financial year were impossible to fulfil, 



the Corporations profit after taxes was up by a further 10 percent to DM 273 million.

Boehringer Ingelheim spent a total of DM 1,068 million on research 



and development in 1995. This represented 17% of sales of all 



Business Areas.<br>



As in recent years, research and development activities were 



again concentrated on Business Area Human Pharmaceuticals. For 



the first time in the history of the Company, expenditure passed 



the billion DM mark. Compared with spending in the preceding year, 



this is a rise of DM 127 million or 13%.<br>



Where our own research projects are in the initial stages or where 



a need is seen to support ongoing programmes with external 



know-how, the Company increasingly forms alliances with 



universities and specialized research companies.



<br>



In 1995 the following  future-oriented alliances were concluded: 



<dir>



<li><a href="reng_rad2.htm">Co-operation with<br>



Sequana Therapeutics, Inc.,<br>



La Jolla, California</a>



<li><a href="reng_rad3.htm">Co-operation with<br>



Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,<br>



Carlsbad, California</a>

Nach dem guten Vorjahr - dem bis dahin wirtschaftlich erfolgreichsten Jahr seiner Firmengeschichte -



 konnte Boehringer Ingelheim im Berichtsjahr 1995 diesen Erfolg noch einmal steigern. Trotz der negativen



 Entwicklung fast aller f&uumlr Boehringer Ingelheim relevanten Auslandsw&auml;hrungen gegen&uuml;ber der 



DM, die auch einige der Erwartungen f&uumlr das abgelaufene Gesch&auml;ftsjahr nicht ganz eintreten lie&szlig;, 



ist es gelungen, das Ergebnis nach Steuern des Unternehmensverbandes um weitere 10 Prozent auf 273 Mio 



DM zu verbessern.

Boehringer Ingelheim hat im Jahre 1995 insgesamt 1.068 Mio DM fr Forschung und Entwicklung aufgewandt. Das entspricht 17% der Erlse aller Geschftsgebiete. <br>



Wie in den Vorjahren lag der Schwerpunkt der Forschungs- und Entwicklungsaktivitten im Geschftsgebiet Humanpharma. Dort berstiegen die Aufwendungen zum ersten Mal in der Geschichte des Unternehmens die Milliarden DM-Grenze. Im Vergleich zum entsprechenden Vorjahresaufwand bedeutet das eine Erhhung um 127 Mio DM bzw. 13%. <br>



Wo die eigenen Forschungsvorhaben am Anfang stehen und wo die Notwendigkeit gesehen wird, die laufenden Programme durch externes Know-how zu untersttzen, geht das Unternehmen verstrkt Koopera-tionen mit Universitten und spezialisierten Forschungsfirmen ein. <br>



<br>Im Jahre 1995 wurden folgende zukunftsorientierte Kooperationen zum Abschlu gebracht: 



<dir>



<li><a href="rger_rad2.htm">Kooperation mit Sequana Therapeutics Inc., La Jolla, Kalifornien</a>



<li><a href="rger_rad3.htm">Kooperation mit Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc., Carlsbad, Kalifornien</a>

Vorjahr. Auf Deutschland entfielen 8.279 oder 36% der Gesamtbelegschaft, und 14.998 bzw. 



64% auf die brige Welt. Der Personalaufwand belief sich auf insgesamt 2.024 Mio DM, das 



bedeutet gegen-ber dem Vorjahr 



eine Reduzierung um 1%; die Pesonalkostenquote verringerte sich um 1,3% auf 31,5%.

Net sales amounted to DM 6,429 million, representing a growth of 



3% (1994:+9.5%). The highly satisfactory improvement of over 11% 



resulting from volume and price in- creases and growth of almost 



one percent-age point from the first-time consolidation of newly 



acquired companies were offset by conversion losses of 6.5% sustained 



as a result of the currency situation. We divested ourselves of our 



subsidiary BIOSCIENTIA with effect from 1 January 1995 by way of a 



management buy-out. We sold the medical devices business run by Boehringer 



Ingelheim KG in Germany and also the ACTILYSE business run by our Canadian 



subsidiary back to Genentech. The sale of these businesses eroded sales 



by a further 2.5% compared with the previous year.

Although income in the year under review suffered from the losses 



on conversion of the financial statements of our foreign 



subsidiaries, the success of our business activities paved the 



way for a rise in the operating income of the 



Corporation of DM 44 million to DM 675 million.<br>



The positive financial result in the year under review, at 



DM 43 million, showed a marked improvement upon 1994. In the 



preceding year, various circumstances, eg value adjust-ments 



of fixed-interest securities, had an adverse effect on the 



financial result. But, in 1995 it benefited from the release 



from valuation provisions for financial claims and from the 



revaluation of financial investments 



following the downward trend in interest rates.<br>



As in the previous year, the negative holding income at DM 



19 million (1994: - DM 52 million) was due primarily to expenses 



incurred as a result of the sale of subsidiaries and shareholdings.<br>



Tax expenditure in the year under review rose by about 40% to DM 



426 million. This represents a taxation ratio of almost 61%. 



As already indicated, net income after taxes improved by a further 



10% in 1995 to DM  273 million.

<td colspan=2>

1996 is expected to see further progress at Boehringer Ingelheim: 

extensive marketing activities are planned in connection with new 



product introductions. With the greatest investment volume to date, 



major strategic measures are to be implemented to shape the future 



of the Corporation. What is more, we intend to intensify our 



development efforts still further. These projects and measures 



are hoped to bring about a crucial improvement in the future 



efficiency and competitiveness of Boehringer Ingelheim.<br>







As regards net sales, the current year is only expected to see 



a minor increase in growth rates compared with 1995. Where there 



are hopes of increases in volume sales, these hopes are being 



dashed to some extent by price restrictions in important markets 



and adverse currency movements especially in the case of the Japanese Yen.<br>







Although we do not expect similar losses from the conversion of 



the annual financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries in the 



current year as were incurred in 1995, it will not be easy to match 



the success of the past two years in terms of profit in view of 



the prevailing conditions and projects we have described. Still, 



efforts in 1996 will concentrate on 



continuing the upward trend of the past few years.

Sales of Strategic Business Unit Ethical Pharmaceuticals were a

The 6% growth in volume derived from new introductions and the 



almost 8% growth from other products was offset by 



the negative exchange rate movements of currencies against the DM 



which amounted to 7% when sales in those currencies were translated 



into DM.<br>



The international ethical business and the international hospital 



business where the strategic focus is on intensive medicine posted 



satisfactory sales growth.

The development and restructuring of Strategic Business Unit 



Self-Medication continued in 1995. Sales  growth was almost 6% 



up on 1994. The negative exchange rate developments, particularly 



as regards the dollar, meant that the target of two-figure growth 



rates was impossible to achieve. This situation was further 



aggravated by the crisis in Mexico, one of the most important 



SM countries for Boehringer Ingelheim. SM sales as a percentage 



of human pharmaceutical sales rose slightly to around 12%. 



World-wide our activities are concentrated on the indication 



areas 1. cough and cold, 2. gastrointestinal and 



3. phytopharmaceuticals, vitamins and mineral products.

The restructuring which began in recent years was systematically 



continued and is beginning to yield the anticipated results. 



This restructuring involved concentration of the production sites 



and a considerable reduction in personnel both in Germany and 



abroad. The stream-lining of the product groups and the 



future-oriented development of the key sites in particular will 



entail extensive investment, especially in the production of active 



ingredients. This will amount to around DM 500 



million by 1999. Bearing in mind the one-off expenses incurred for 



the restructuring, the result in 1995 was satisfactory. 



In the medium term the new business strategy will ensure lasting 



profitability.

Global control of the Business Area, incorporating in particular 



key countries (USA, Mexico, Germany, France, Scandinavia), proved 



successful, as did concentration on the strategic target segments 



therapeutic specialties, antibiotics and vaccines. 



In North America the strategic alliance with NOBL in the US swine 



market, the improved market penetration with cattle vaccines and 



the successful development of BIVATOP (oxytetracycline) in the 



USA and Canada proved to be the principal factors behind the 



positive trend. We acquired the US company Fermenta on 1 October 



1995. The product range considerably helped us gear our business 



strategically to the US market and secure the leading position in 



the swine and cattle business. The European market showed positive 



growth in terms of both sales and income. This development was 



due in large part to the launch of METACAM in other European 



countries, to the very good growth of business in Scandinavia and 



to the growth of the small animals business in Germany. The 



successful launch of DIAKUR in Asia by our Japanese partner 



Sumitomo merits special mention.

Business Area Bakery and Foods was able to improve its position 



with both the artisan and industry sector, while increasing its 



earnings potential, in spite of the continued stagnation in 



consumption in Europe.<br>



The German business recorded slight volume growth in the artisan, 



the industrial and the export markets. France witnessed first 



steps towards consolidation of their market position in the 



artisan business following intensive integration and restructuring 



programmes at BI Alimentaire (BIAL). Satisfactory growth rates 



were reported in Spain and Scandinavia. In Austria lower market 



price levels were the result of the countrys entry into the EU.

A co-operation programme agreed between Boehringer Ingelheim and 



Isis combines the research and development capacity of the two 



companies in the field of cell adhesion  in an effort to find 



innovative drugs with which to treat a wide range of inflammatory 



diseases. Through this alliance with Isis, Boehringer Ingelheim, 



already one of the worlds leaders in cell adhesion, has secured 



access to highly promising technology such as antisense 



(specific inhibition of genetic information) and combinatorial 



chemistry (automatic parallel synthesis of chemical compounds).

Considerable progress was made in 1995 with respect to registrations.<br> 



Marketing authorization for the European Union can be expected 



soon for MOBIC (meloxicam), a new non-steroidal antirheumatic 



agent, which has shown considerably better mucosal tolerance in 



the gastrointestinal tract than other rheumatic agents in clinical 



trials. MOBIC is one of the first prod-ucts to be registered in 



Europe according to the "mutual recognition procedure. 



Other products for which the registration process has made good 



progress include a product based on tamsulosin, developed jointly 



with the Japanese company Yamanouchi and designed for the treatment 



of the symptoms produced by benign enlargement of the prostate, 



COMBIVENT, a combination of ATROVENT and salbutamol for the 



treatment of bronchial spasm associated with chronic obstructive 



airways diseases, and ATROVENT nasal for the treatment of 



allergic and non-allergic rhinitis. Marketing authorization has 



already been granted for ATROVENT nasal in a number of countries. 



In Japan, marketing authorization is expected in 1996 for 



DOMIN (talipexole), a medicine for the treatment of Parkinsons 



disease.

Since the beginning of 1995 the operating units Boehringer 



Ingelheim KG, Dr. Karl Thomae GmbH, Basotherm GmbH and Delta-Pharma 



GmbH have been under joint management following global restructuring. 



Business Unit Ethical Pharmaceuticals sales growth of 7% in the 



year under review has already begun to reflect the effects of the 



restructuring of the entire marketing and sales organization at 



Boehringer Ingelheim KG and Dr. Karl Thomae GmbH which we embarked 



upon at the start of 1995.<br>



Almost all the mainstays of our ethical business and the new 



introduction ANDANTE showed positive growth. Particularly gratifying 



sales growth was recorded by DITEC, BERODUAL, MUCOSOLVAN, DENAN, 



FUCIDINE and INHACORT. ERGO-LONARID and MEXITIL, however, 



experienced a drop in sales.<br>



In the hospital business, now also under joint management, special 



mention must be made of the growth of ACTILYSE.

At just under 3%, economic growth in 1995 was lower than anticipated. 



The national health service continued to put pressure on service 



providers to lower costs. In light of such circumstances and in view 



of the very conservative pharmaceutical market, it is becoming 



increasingly difficult to achieve growth with the older products or 



to post immediately satisfactory sales with new launches.<br>



Nevertheless, our endeavours to secure further market growth in 1995 



proved successful despite fierce competition. The positions of 



MOTENS and COMBIVENT as metered dose inhalers and as unit-dose 



vials were consolidated. The combined growth of our prescription and 



hospital business exceeded that of the market average. The vigorous 



growth in sales of 36% of our hospital business stemmed primarily 



from increased sales with ACTILYSE (+31%) and BONEFOS  (+31%). 



The Windsor Healthcare self-medication business showed 10% growth.<br>



Our Business Area Animal Health increased sales by 32%. It was not



 merely established products, but also the product launch of 



VIACUTAN and the continuing strong growth of METACAM which 



contributed to this result.

Boehringer Ingelheim launched the OPINA project in a move to allow 



our businesses and functions to be viewed and developed from a 



supraregional standpoint. One of the first results of the project 



work is the reorientation of our production concept (concentration 



of production from four down to two sites). By the year 2000, 



the North American pharma business 



should account for about one third of our world pharma sales.<br><br>

In financial year 1995, both our own pharma business and the 



inlicensed lines showed satisfactory growth rates. This was due 



mainly to the extraordinary success of ALESION.<br>



On the other hand, we fell slightly short of our targets for 



generics, OTC products and fine chemicals.<br>



The launch of DOMIN - an anti-parkinsonism agent - is scheduled 



for 1996. Registration is proceeding according to plan. An 



additional dosage form of MUCOSOLVAN retard is being developed in 



collaboration with Teijin and will be marketed by both companies 



under the name MUCOSOL L as of October 1996.

Obwohl das Ergebnis im Berichtsjahr in ganz erheblichem Mae mit Verlusten aus der Umrechnung der Jahresabschlsse unserer auslndischen Tochtergesellschaften belastet ist, lieen die Erfolge unserer geschftlichen Ttigkeit das Betriebsergebnis des Unterneh-mensverbandes um 44 Mio DM auf 675 Mio DM anwachsen.<br>



Das Finanzergebnis ist im Berichtsjahr mit 43 Mio DM positiv, was eine deutliche Verbesserung gegenber 1994 bedeutet. Im Vorjahr hatten sich verschiedene Sachverhalte, wie z. B. Wertberichtigungen auf festverzinsliche Wertpapiere, negativ auf das Finanzergebnis ausgewirkt. Im Gegensatz dazu ist das Finanzergebnis des Berichtsjahres 1995 durch die Auflsung von Wertberichtigungen auf Finanzforderungen und durch Wertaufholung bei den Finanzanlagen infolge der rcklufigen Zinsentwicklung positiv beeinflut<br>



Das mit 19 Mio DM negative Beteiligungs-ergebnis (1994: -52 Mio DM) ist, hnlich wie im Vorjahr, berwiegend durch Aufwendungen verursacht, die im Zusammenhang mit der Veruerung von Tochtergesellschaften und Beteiligungen angefallen sind.



Das Ergebnis vor Steuern konnte damit im Jahr 1995 um rund ein Viertel auf 699 Mio DM gesteigert werden.<br>



Der Steueraufwand erhhte sich im Berichtsjahr um rund 40% auf 426 Mio DM. Dies entspricht einer Steuerquote von fast 61%. Damit konnte - wie bereits erwhnt - das Ergebnis nach Steuern im Berichtsjahr 1995 um weitere 10% auf 273 Mio DM verbessert werden.

Das Jahr 1996 soll fr Boehringer Ingelheim weitere Fortschritte bringen: Im Zusammenhang mit der Einfhrung neuer Produkte sind umfangreiche Marketingaktivitten geplant. Mit dem bisher grten Investitionsvolumen sollen wichtige strategische Manahmen zur Gestaltung der Zukunft des Unternehmens in Angriff genommen werden. Darber hinaus werden wir unsere Forschungs und Entwicklungsbemhungen mit erhhtem Aufwand noch weiter intensivieren. Mit diesen Projekten und Manahmen wollen wir die Effizienz und Wettbewerbsfhigkeit von Boehringer Ingelheim knftig entscheidend verbessern.<br>







Bei den Gesamterlsen gehen wir fr das laufende Jahr von einer nur geringfgig hheren Zuwachsrate als im Berichtsjahr 1995 aus. Erwartete gute Mengensteige-rungen werden durch Preisrestriktionen in wichtigen Mrkten und durch negative Wh-rungskurseinflsse - insbesondere beim japanischen Yenteilweise wieder zunichte gemacht werden.<br>







Obwohl wir im laufenden Jahr nicht in dem Mae wie in 1995 mit Verlusten aus der Um-rechnung der Jahresabschlsse unserer aus-lndischen Tochtergesellschaften rechnen, wird es aufgrund der dargestellten Rahmenbedingungen und Vorhaben nicht einfach sein, auf der Ergebnisseite an die Erfolge der beiden Vorjahre anzuknpfen. Dennoch wird im Jahr 1996 Kernpunkt unserer Bemh-ungen sein, den Aufwrtstrend der Vorjahre fortzusetzen.

Der Auf- und Ausbau der Strategischen Geschftseinheit Selbstmedikation wurde im Jahre 1995 weiter fortgesetzt. Das Umsatzwachstum betrug gegenber 1994 gut 6%. Das Ziel einer zweistelligen Wachstumsrate konnte aufgrund der negativen Whrungskurseinflsse, insbesondere im Dollar-Raum, nicht erreicht werden. Hinzu kam die Krise in Mexiko, einem der wichtigsten Boehringer Ingelheim SM-Lnder. Der Anteil am Human-pharma-Geschft ist mit rund 12% leicht gestiegen. Weltweit konzentrieren sich unsere Aktivitten auf die Indikationsbereiche  1. Husten und Erkltung, 2. Gastro-Intestinal sowie 3. Phytopharmaka, Vitamin-/Mineralprparate.

Die Umsetzung der in den vergangenen Jahren eingeleiteten Neuorientierung wurde 



konsequent weitergefhrt und zeigt die erhofften Erfolge. Mit der Neuausrichtung 



waren eine Konzentration der Produktionsstandorte und ein erheblicher Personalabbau 



im In- und Ausland verbunden. Mit der Straf-fung der Produktgruppen und der 



zukunftsorientierten Ausrichtung vor allem der Kernstandorte, sind umfangreiche 



Investitionen, insbesondere in der Wirkstoffproduktion, verbunden. Sie werden 



sich bis 1999 auf rund 500 Mio DM belaufen. 1995 wurde unter Bercksichtigung der 



fr die Restrukturierung angefallenen Einmalkosten ein zufriedenstellendes Ergebnis 



erreicht. Mittelfristig wird die neue Geschftsstrategie eine nachhaltige Rentabilitt 



dieses Arbeitsgebietes sichern.

Die globale Steuerung des Geschftsgebietes, unter besonderer Einbindung von 



Schlssellndern (USA, Mexiko, Deutschland, Frankreich, Skandinavien) hat sich ebenso 



bewhrt wie die Konzentration auf die strategischen Zielsegmente therapeutische 



Spezialitten, Antibiotika und Impfstoffe. In Nordamerika erwiesen sich die strategische 



Allianz mit der Firma NOBL auf dem Markt fr Schweine in den USA, die verbesserte 



Marktdurchdringung mit Rinderimpfstoffen sowie die erfolgreiche Entwicklung von 



BIVA-TOP (Oxytetracyclin) in USA und Kanada als Hauptfaktoren fr eine erfolgreiche 



Entwicklung. Per 1. Oktober 1995 haben wir die US-Gesellschaft Fermenta akquiriert. 



Mit deren Produktpalette konnte die strategische Ausrichtung auf den US-Markt wesentlich 



verbessert und die Marktfhrerschaft im Marktsegment Schweine erreicht werden. 



Der europische Markt entwickelte sich sowohl bei den Erlsen wie auch beim Ergebnis 



positiv. Diese Entwicklung wurde getragen durch die Einfhrung von METACAM 



in weiteren Lndern Europas, einer sehr guten Entwicklung des Geschftes in 



Skandinavien sowie der Intensivierung des Kleintiergeschftes in Deutschland.



In Asien ist die erfolgreiche Einfhrung von DIAKUR durch unseren Partner Sumitomo 



in Japan besonders zu erwhnen.

auszubauen und die Ertragsfhigkeit zu steigern.<br>



Das Deutschlandgeschft verzeichnet leichte Volumenzuwchse im Handwerks-, Industrie- 



und Exportbereich. In Frankreich konnte nach langwierigen Restrukturierungsmanahmen 



bei BI Alimentaire (BIAL) die Prsenz im Handwerksbereich erstmals wieder verstrkt 



werden. Zufriedenstellende Zuwchse sind aus Spanien und Skandinavien zu vermelden, 



im sterreichischen Markt hat sich 



seit dem EU-Beitritt ein neues, merklich reduziertes Preisniveau etabliert.

Auf dem Gebiet der Asthmaforschung arbeiten Boehringer Ingelheim, Sequana Therapeutics Inc. sowie das Samuel Lunenfeld Forschungsinstitut des Mount Sinai Hospitals, Toronto, zusammen. Gemeinsames Ziel ist es, Gene zu identifizieren, die eine Rolle bei der Entstehung von Asthma spielen knnen. Sequana ist es bereits gelungen, zwei kleine Abschnitte auf zwei Chromosomen aufzu-finden, in denen sich jeweils ein mit der Krankheit Asthma zusammenhngendes Gen befinden knnte.

Auf dem Gebiete der Registrierung konnten im Jahre 1995 beachtliche Fortschritte 



erzielt werden.<br>



Fr MOBIC (Meloxicam), ein neues, nicht steroidales Antirheumatikum, das im Vergleich 



zu anderen Rheumamitteln in klinischen Prfungen eine berlegene 



Schleimhautvertrglichkeit im Bereiche des Magen-Darmtraktes gezeigt hat, kann in 



Krze in den Lndern der Europischen Union mit der Zulassung gerechnet werden. 



MOBIC gehrt zu den ersten Prparaten, die nach dem "gegenseitigen 



Anerkennungsverfahren" in Europa zugelassen werden.



Weitere Prparate, bei denen der Registrierungsproze gute Fortschritte gemacht hat, 



sind das gemeinsam mit dem japanischen Unternehmen Yamanouchi entwickelte Medikament 



mit der Substanz Tamulosin, das zur symptomatischen Behandlung der gutartigen 



Prostatavergrerung bestimmt ist, COMBIVENT, eine Kombination aus ATROVENT und 



Salbutamol zur Therapie von Spasmen der Bronchien bei chronischobstruktiven 



Lungenerkrankungen sowie ATROVENT nasal zur Behandlung allergischer und 



nichtallergischer Formen des Schnupfens. Fr ATROVENT nasal wurde bereits in einer 



Reihe von Lndern die Zulassung erteilt. In Japan wird 1996 die Registrierung von 



DOMIN (Talipexol), einem Medikament zur Behandlung des Parkinson-Syndroms erwartet.

Seit Anfang 1995 agieren die operativen Einheiten Boehringer Ingelheim KG, Dr. Karl 



Thomae GmbH, Basotherm GmbH und Delta-Pharma GmbH - nach einer umfassenden 



Restrukturierung - unter einheitlicher Leitung.<br>



Die von der Geschftseinheit Praxis/Klinik erzielten Umsatzzuwchse von 7% im 



Berichtsjahr zeigen bereits die Wirkung der Anfang 1995 vorgenommenen Umstrukturierung 



der gesamten Marketing- und Vertriebsorganisation der Boehringer Ingelheim KG und Dr. 



Karl Thomae GmbH.<br>



Fast alle groen Umsatztrger im Praxisgeschft und die Neueinfhrung ANDANTE 



entwickelten sich positiv. Besonders erfreulich waren die Umsatzzuwchse bei DITEC, 



BERODUAL, MUCOSOLVAN, DENAN, FUCIDINE und INHACORT. Rcklufige Umstze gab es 



dagegen bei ERGO-LONARID und MEXITIL.<br>



Im Klinikgeschft, das ebenfalls unter einheitliche Leitung gestellt wurde, ist besonders 



die Entwicklung von ACTILYSE hervorzuheben.<br>



Die Delta-Pharma GmbH verzeichnete erfreuliche Umsatzzuwchse. Fr das Jahr 1996 ist 



aufgrund der bernahme der Infusionslsungen der Firma Clyntec/Salvia eine hnlich 



gute Entwicklung zu erwarten.<br>



Auch das Ophthalmika-/Dermatika-Geschft der Basotherm entwickelte sich weiter positiv 



(+5%). Das Industriegeschft (Hautschutz/ Hautpflege) wurde zum 1. Oktober 1995 



veruert.<br>



Boehringer Ingelheim ist im deutschen Selbstmedikationsmarkt mit den Vertriebslinien 


Thomae mit den Hauptprparaten THOMAPYRIN, BISOLVON, und DULCOLAX, BI KG mit den 



Hauptprparaten FRUBIASE, BUSCOPAN und EFFORTIL sowie Pharmaton mit den 



Hauptprparaten GERIATRIC PHARMATON, GINSANA und SELEN plus vertreten. Anfang 1995 



wurde die Firma Planta-Subtil bernommen und dadurch das Portfolio um Prparate wie 



ANTISTAX und REUMALESS erweitert.

Das italienische Humanpharma-Geschft verzeichnete nach zwei rcklufigen Jahren 



im Berichtsjahr mit 4% ein geringes Wachstum. Dank einer guten Entwicklung von 



CATAPRESANTTS-Pflaster, LENDORMIN, MUCOSOLVAN und ZEPELINDUE, das unser lteres 



Prparat ZEPELIN ersetzt, konnten wir im italienischen Markt auch in 1995 Anteile 



gewinnen.<br>



BISOLVON LINCTUS wurde auf die Geschftseinheit Selbstmedikation bertragen, die 



jetzt im Markt an 4. Stelle steht. Die Pharmaton-Produkte trugen mit einer sehr 



positiven Entwicklung zu diesem Erfolg bei.<br>



Die Position von ACTILYSE und ALVEOFACT im Hospitalgeschft wurde weiter gefestigt. 



IMUKIN haben wir im Oktober eingefhrt.<br>



Gegen Jahresende erhielten wir die Registrierungen fr MOBIC, OXIVENT, DUOVENT 



Eindosisbehlter, ATROVENT Eindosisbehlter, ATROVENT Nasal und COMBIVENT; einige 



dieser Prparate werden 1996 eingefhrt.

wurden im ab-gelaufenen Jahr besonders intensiv im Fernsehen beworben.<br>



Auch fr den Bereich Industrie- und Spezialprodukte war 1995 ein erfolgreiches Jahr. <br>



Das Geschftsgebiet Back- und Nahrungsmittel konnte ein positives Ergebnis melden.<br>



Das Geschftsgebiet Tiergesundheit und die Geschftseinheit Feinchemikalien sind 



berdurchschnittlich gewachsen, der Umsatzzuwachs des Biosystem-Geschftes war

Im Hospitalgeschft steigerte ACTILYSE seinen Anteil am Markt der Fibrinolytika auf 70%.<br>







Die ATROVENT Eindosisbehlter, eingefhrt Ende 1994, erfllten unsere Erwartungen und 



trugen dazu bei, da die Anticholinergika zur Behandlung der obstruktiven Atemwegserkrankungen 



immer mehr anerkannt werden.<br>



Im Verschreibungsmarkt erhhten SURBRONC (MUCOSOLVAN), das grte Prparat im 



Indikationsgebiet Atemwegsprparate und BISOLVON ihren Marktanteil auf zusammen 18%.<br>



CALDINE (MOTENS), ein Calciumantagonist, erreichte im dritten Jahr nach Einfhrung ein

Unsere sterreichische Tochtergesellschaft Bender + Co Ges mbH Wien hat trotz schwieriger 



Rahmenbedingungen ihre starke Position auf dem Apothekenmarkt halten knnen. Das 



Krankenhausgeschft ist durch ACTI-LYSE und NAVELBINE (onkologisches Lizenzprodukt von 



Fabre) gewachsen. Die pulmologische Palette entwickelte sich durch BERODUAL und PULMILIDE 



gut weiter. Die bei Bender in Wien biotechnisch hergestellten Zytokine BEROFOR (Interferon 



Alpha) und IMUKIN (Interferon Gamma) hielten ihre starke Position. Im Hospital-Geschft 



wurde ORAMORPH, im SM- Geschft RHINOSPRAY plus erfolgreich eingefhrt.<br>



Im September 1995 wurden die neuen biotechnologischen Forschungs- und Produktionsanlagen 



bei Bender feierlich erffnet. Damit ist die wichtigste Phase der Umstrukturierung des 



Standortes erfolgreich abgeschlossen. Der Unternehmensverband verfgt nun in Wien ber 



eine hochmoderne Pilotanlage zur Herstellung patientenspezifischer Tumorvakzine sowie ber 



ein modernes Biotechnikum, in dem Humanproteine mittels gentechnischer Verfahren hergestellt 



erden. Neben den Interferonen Alpha, Gamma sowie TNF Alpha wurde in Zusammenarbeit mit 



Thomae die Herstellung von Interferon Beta fr Schering Berlin aufgenommen. Die Kapazitt 



reicht fr deren gesamten Europabedarf. Interferon Beta  wird fr die Behandlung der Multiplen 



Sklerose erfolgreich eingesetzt.

Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals konnte 1995 erneut ein berdurchschnittliches 



Umsatzwachstum in US-Dollar erzielen. Ausschlaggebend hierfr war vor allem der Erfolg 



von ATROVENT zur Behandlung von Chronisch Obstruktiver Bronchitis. Die hohe Umsatzsteigerung 



in US-Dollar um 30% wird jedoch in der DM-Betrachtung aufgrund der verschlechterten 



US-Dollar/DM-Relation abgeschwcht.<br>



Anfang 1996 wird ATROVENT Nasal in den US-Markt eingefhrt. Ende 1996/Anfang 1997 ist die 



Einfhrung von COMBIVENT vorgesehen. Von beiden Prparaten werden wesentliche Beitrge zur 



weiteren Umsatzentwicklung erwartet.<br>



Unsere Tochtergesellschaft Roxane Laboratories (Generika) mit Sitz in Ohio, die jetzt 



zusammen mit Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceutical eine "Business Unit Ethical Pharmaceuticals" 



bildet, konnte die Vorjahresumstze in US-Dollar um 20% bertreffen. Die Narkotika-Analgetika-Linie 



gewinnt in der Produktpalette dieser Gesellschaft immer strkere Bedeutung. Roxane wird 



diese fhrende strategische Position in 1996 weiter ausbauen. Die Akquisition des Eli Lilly 



Produktes METHADONE Ende 1994 trgt dazu wesentlich bei.

The healthcare reforms, debated now for several years by President 



Clinton, were blocked by the new Republican Congress elected in 1995. 



Nevertheless, the now much vaster "Managed Care"  market is sustaining 



the pressure on the pharmaceutical industry. Major US pharmaceutical 



concerns have responded by acquiring service companies such as 



"Pharmacy Benefit Managers" or the "Health Management Organization". 



This is an attempt to regain control of distribution channels, and 



hence more direct access to the decision makers (insurance companies, 



employers). The number of "fee for service" customers is falling 



noticeably and we expect over 70% of insured people in the USA to 



receive care one way or another from a "Managed Care" company by the 



year 2000.<br>



One of the most innovative responses to this transition is the 



development of "Disease Management Programmes". These involve 



extensive integrated systems on the prevention, diagnosis and 



therapy of diseases. Boehringer Ingelheim USA has a headstart 



here. It is possible to offer innovative products (Boehringer 



Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals) and generics (Roxane Laboratories) 



concurrently. Furthermore, we already enjoy a strong position in 



the respiratory market.<br>

Boehringer Ingelheim Canada was unable to match the sales posted in 



the previous year owing to the stagnation in the pharma market and 



its returning the rights to LYSATEC (t-PA). The government is 



struggling with a very high deficit and, above all, with the very 



close outcome of the referendum on Quebec sovereignty. Consequently, 



the rate of exchange of the Canadian dollar to the US dollar and the 



D-mark is not expected to improve. All the provinces are planning cost-containment measures (reference pricing, closed provincial formularies, therapeutic guidelines), which will greatly benefit generic companies. Their share of prescriptions is expected to balloon to 40% of the whole market within the next 2 - 3 years. 



In early 1995 the marketing rights to the hugely successful product 



LYSATEC (t-PA) were sold back to Genentech, which explains the drop 



in sales of DM 16 million compared with 1994.<br>



Although the patent on the ATROVENT inhalation solution has expired, 



the product withstood the competition from generics, posting a further 



6% growth.<br>



The goal of our ethical business to raise our market share in Canada 



is to be attained partly by our own efforts (introduction of 



COMBIVENT), and partly through the acquisition of new products and 



businesses.

<td colspan=2>



The currency crisis in Mexico hampered economic development throughout 



1995. The peso continued to fall against the American dollar despite 



international support. The necessary price adjustments were impossible 



owing to the poor purchasing power of the population which did not 



allow for much flexibility. In terms of volume, the pharma market 



showed a clear regression. It is still doubtful if the present 



government is strong enough to master the crisis. We do not expect 



any major improvement in the macro-economic situation in 1996. 



However, our confidence in the countrys ability to pull through is 



undiminished.<br>



Although Boehringer Ingelheim Mexico was able to improve its market 



share in this difficult period, sales fell by DM 92 million. 



The products launched in 1995, MOTENS (lacidipine), NOVATRIM 



(brodimoprim) and ILSATEC (lansoprazole) have further consolidated 



our position.

<B>$50 MILLION PROJECT KICKS OFF<BR> 
Boehringer Ingelheim shows confidence in city</B><BR>
<P>
Balloons, live music, speeches and a steak lunch for 400 were part of the festivities Friday as Boehringer Ingelheim held a groundbreaking ceremony to mark the start of its new <A HREF="a0080000.htm">multimillion-dollar expansion</A>.
<P>
Boehringer officials from as far as the parent companys headquarters in Ingelheim, Germany, were here to participate in the event that begins a new era for the international drug company.
<P>
Dr. Claus Rohleder, a member of the managing board of directors of Boehringer Ingelheim in Germany, said the acquisition of Fermenta Animal health last year and the construction of a state-of-the-art production facility in St. Joseph signal the companys intention to become a major player in the animal health industry.  Currently, the animal health segment of the international company is only about 89 percent of total sales, Mr. Rohleder said.
<P>
"This represents an investment in the future, and it represents change for a worldwide company.  We look at change as an opportunity," Mr. Rohleder said to the companys workers and guests.  "This will be a center of excellence that will generate greater sales and profits, built on a foundation of good people.  We are depositing our confidence in you."
<P>
Boehringer expansion and modernization plans, which will total about $50 million, will be constructed in two phases over the next five year.  Ground was broken Friday for the first phase, a world-class facility for manufacturing biological animal health products.  The new 80,000-square-foot manufacturing center, which will cost about $39 million, is expected to be ready by the spring of 1998.
<P>
The second phase of the expansion project involves construction of a 30,000-squre-foot research and development center.
<P>
When complete, the expansion will make St. Joseph on of  North Americas largest producers of animal health products.  Boehringer officials say the manufacturing facility will upgrade the companys production and regulatory compliance center to a world-class level, making St. Joseph-made products even more competitive in animal health markets worldwide. 
<P>
Boehringer officials have said the expansion will add to the companys 300-person  payroll, but how much is undetermined.
<P>
Participating in the dedication ceremony besides Mr. Rohleder were Werner Gerstenberg, president and chief executive office of all U.S. operations, based in Ridgefield, Conn.;  Dieterich Janott, head of global business operations, based in Germany; Fintan Molloy, president of Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health, based in St. Joseph; State Rep. Glenda Kelly and Mayor Larry Stobbs.
<P>
Ms. Kelly called the event a day of real celebration for our communitys spirit and future.
<P>
"You could have gone anywhere. Other states were competing for this facility",  she said.  "To all of you at Boehringer Ingelheim, we say thank you for choosing this community for your new state-of-the-art facility.  This community will be with you every step of the way."
<P>
Mr. Stobbs presented a key to the city to Mr. Molloy, Mr. Rohleder and Mr. Janott.
<P> 
"The thing we had that no one could compete with is those folks sitting out there in those chairs,"  Mr. Stobbs said, pointing to the employees.
<P>
Mr. Gerstenberg also had praise for the St. Joseph work force, which helped plan the new facility.
<P>
"We can talk about buildings, but our most important resource is our people,"  he said,  "Im proud of your positive mind set.  Youve embraced our vision.  Now you will help us become a world-class company."

<B>August 2, 1995</B>  <I>St. Joseph News-Press * Terry Raffensperger - Business Editor</I>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<B>Boehringer reaches accord to buy Fermenta</B><BR> 

<P>

Boehringer Ingelheim, a German-owned chemical pharmaceutical company, and Swedish-

owned Fermenta Animal Health, have agreed to a letter of intent for Boehringer to purchase 

Fermenta.

<P>

A statement released by Boehringer's corporate headquarters for U.S. operations in 

Ridgefield, Conn., said after a "due diligence" review of the proposed agreement by both 

sides, the deal was expected to be completed in October.

<P>

Both companies operate manufacturing facilities in this area.  Boehringer Ingelheim Animal 

Heath operates a research and manufacturing complex on 63-acres along the North Belt 

Highway at Gene Field Road that employs about 250 people.  The facility develops and 

manufactures serums and vaccines for cattle, horses, sheep, swine, dogs and cats, for the 

United States market.  

<P>

Boehringer officials in May announced plans to invest $50 million to expand and upgrade 

the St. Joseph operation so it could develop and make products that would be marketed around 

the world.  In 1994, Boehringer's animal health business had sales of about $165 million.  

The German parent company has annual sales of about $3 billion.

<P>

Fermenta's operations in the United States are based in Kansas City, which headquarters 

near KCI Airport.  But the primary manufacturing and warehouse facility for Fermenta is in 

Elwood, Kansas.  Fermenta employs about 270 people, with 170 of those at Elwood.  

Fermenta produces insecticides for cattle and animal anti-bacterials and other 

pharmaceutical products.

<P>

In the announcement released by Boehringer, Claus D. Rohleder, on the board of the 

German parent company and responsible for animal health operations, said he "welcomed 

the deal as a valuable contribution to Boehringer Ingelheim's strategy to expand its animal 

health business on a global basis."

<P>

<B>Agreement on the Transfer of Fermenta Animal Health to Boehringer Ingelheim</B><BR> 



<P>



Boehringer Ingelheim, a pharmaceutical company with headquarters in Ingelheim, Germany, and the 



Stockholm-based Fermenta AB, a holding company of Fermenta Animal Health in Kansas City, have 



concluded the due-diligence process and have reached an agreement on the transfer of Fermenta Animal 



Health to Boehringer Ingelheim.  The transfer was concluded on December 5, 1995.



<P>



Fermenta Animal Health in Kansas City, Missouri has at present 220 employees and is strong in 



antibacterials and therapeutic specialties with sales of more than US $57 million in 1994.



<P>



"Fermenta Animal Health has found in this transfer a long-term committed owner", said Fermenta's 



President and CEO, Kent Jinghall.  "Boehringer Ingelheim will continue with the full-product portfolio of 



Fermenta Animal Health improving customer value for cattle, swine, and other animal specifics", said 



Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health Managing Director, Dietrich Janott.  "This acquisition reflects our 



Animal Health strategy and our commitment to expand our veterinary business, not only organically, but 



also by acquisition.  It will strengthen our market position in the US with combined sales of about US $100  



million per year in this important market," said Dr. Claus D. Rohleder, Member of the Board of Managing 



Directors at Boehringer Ingelheim, responsible for Industry and Special products.



<P>



The production facility at Elwood, Kansas, will serve as a resource of supply for pharmaceutical, 



parasiticide, and medicated feed products, and investments are planned for further improvements to supply 



world-wide markets.



<P>



The terms of the agreement also include the businesses for Fermenta Animal Health in Canada and 



Belgium.  Financial terms of the transfer will not be published.



<P>



Boehringer Ingelheim's animal health business operates world-wide and focuses on the development, 



production , marketing, and distribution of therapeutic specialties, antibiotics, and vaccines.  With about 



160 companies and an annual turnover of more than 6 billion deutschmarks in the field of human 



pharmaceuticals, industrial and special products, Boehringer Ingelheim is represented on every continent.

<B>This module presents some basic functions of adjuvants as they relate to veterinary vaccines.  A brief, but simplistic approach to the basic immunologic functions of animals is presented to better understand the role of vaccines in the animal industry.  More exhaustive research in the literature is recommended to more thoroughly understand the immunological phenomenon in animals.

<P>

The approach used in this model is first to offer some definitions  for the various terms used in the science; secondly briefly offer some of the aspects of the commonly used adjuvants in veterinary science, and third try to relate some of the effects of the use of adjuvants associated with vaccines.

</CENTER>
<HR>
When it comes to bovine respiratory protection, you select a vaccine based on the situation.  Now, with the new Express<font size=1>tm</font> vaccines from Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health, Inc., it's an easy decision.  When you have both Express and Elite<font size=1>tm</font> vaccines, you have the best choice for every situation.
<DL>
<DT><LI><B>Introduction Express For Quick Immunity</B>
<DD>Sometimes cattle need faster protection than most all-killed virus vaccines provide.  thats when you use Express.  In contrast to killed virus vaccines, the Express line combines and IBR-BVD-PI<font size=1>(3)</font> modified live virus (MLV) with a BRSV killed virus.  The result is a powerful defense with a quicker onset of immunity for the MLV fraction.  The ability to deliver quick immunity is ideal for newly arrived feedlot and stocker cattle or dairy calves.  
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><LI><B>Safe MLV Protection</B>
<DD>The IBR-BVD-PI<font size=1>(3)</font> MLV in Express has an excellent track record of safety in dairy and beef cattle one week of age of older.  Some BVD researchers believe that Type I BVD will cross protect for BVD Type II and if MLV Type I BVD is used, it should provide protection possibly lasting a <A HREF="p_ee_4.htm">year</A>.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><LI><B>Proven BRSV Protection</B>
<DD>Express also features the protection for a BRSV killed virus.  Since the BRSV component of Express is a killed virus, it cannot shed or revert to virulence.  Express delivers three major features for protection against BRSV; a large antigenic mass, an inactivation process to preserve antigenicity, and a matrix adjuvant system that enhances the immune response.  
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><LI><B>Add <I><I>H. somnus</I></I>, If  You Choose</B>
<DD>On top of the MLV and killed BRSV defenses, Express 4-HS<font size=1>tm</font> gives you an option of adding <I>H. somnus</I> protection.  Our current vaccines - Express 4<font size=1>tm</font> and Express 4-HS<font size=1>tm</font> - let you choose.

<HR>
When safety in pregnant cows is your primary concern, Elite is the ideal choice.  Elite vaccines are made of an all-killed IBR-BVD-PI<font size=1>(3)</font>-BRSV virus.  The complete line includes Elite 4<font size=1>tm</font>, Elite 4-HS<font size=1>tm</font>, Elite 9<font size=1>tm</font>, and Elite9-HS<font size=1>tm</font>.  With Elite9-HS<font size=1>tm</font> you get both <I>H. somnus</I> and five strains of Leptospira in addition to IBR-BVD-PI<font size=1>(3)</font>-BRSV.

<DL>
<DT><LI><B>Safe For All Cattle</B>
<DD>All-killed Elite vaccines offer the safest respiratory disease protection for all cattle - from nursing calves to pregnant cows.  comparative studies show Elite has no adverse effects on milk production.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><LI><B>BRSV Direct Challenge Trials</B>
<DD>Several direct challenge studies confirm the efficacy of the killed viruses used in Elite.  As with Express, a study of Elites BRSV killed virus shows 100% efficacy against the recovery of BRSV.  
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><LI><B>BVD Direct Challenge Trials</B>
<DD>In an Elite BVD trial, white cell counts remained normal after virulent challenge in vaccinated cattle, while the control group showed a significant drop.  These results indicate a high degree of BVD protection.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><LI><B>IBR Direct Challenge Trials</B>
<DD>Elite has also been tested by direct challenge with the IBR virus.  The vaccinated group maintained a normal temperature range while the controls exhibited a temperature spike, indicating that vaccinated cattle received excellent protection against IBR infection.

The definition of each of this terms and how they relate to the use of adjuvants and vaccines are described in subsequent slides.

The primary definition of an antigen is found in the next slide.  It is important to understand that an antigen can be most anything that is foreign to the body in which it might be introduced.  The ability of the body to respond to an antigen is dependant upon many factors; some of which will be discussed later in this module.

The most potent antigens are made up of proteins; the larger the molecule, the more stimulation of the immune response.  There are some other molecules that will stimulate an immune response, but usually to a lessor degree:  polysachharides, lipopolysaccharides, etc.

As defined in this slide, vaccines are very important in the control and prevention of disease caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites, allergens, etc.  Potent vaccines can induce a high level of immunity that may last for a long time; other vaccines, by nature of their composition of antigens, may only protect animals for a short period of time.  The development of vaccines by manufacturers must consider the antigenic make  and the relative strength of antigens as they are being investigated.

In the veterinary industry, most diseases can be classified into 4 general areas as shown.  Although not all inclusive, when one looks at the array of vaccines that are available to the producer, most all of them cover the above areas.  The same holds true for other target species.

Traditional vaccines are derived from the manipulation of whole virus particles or soluble components of  the viruses.  Newer technologies and genetic engineering schemes will provide more sophisticated vaccines, especially viral, in the future.  Another exciting area is the making of the antigens in the laboratory rather than being made in nature.  This can open up a whole new way of manufacturing and developing safer vaccines.

All regulatory agencies, domestic as well as foreign, require that vaccines be made to be safe in the target species.  In addition, correlation studies in laboratory animals provides an important monitoring tool during the manufacturing process to determine how safe a process will be  in the formulation of vaccines.  It is important to consider the environmental  impact of vaccines, its uses, and  exposure to animals outside of the host species that the vaccine is intended.  This is especially important when developing and using modified live vaccines.

The potency of a vaccine is correlated to actual protection in the host animal species.  Usually a laboratory animal (because of cost of running a test) is used to judge the relative potency of each and every serial of vaccine that is manufactured.  All manufacturers of vaccines in the United States are required to test each and every batch of vaccine for  purity,  safety, and potency before it is released to the market place.  In addition, the government testing laboratory in Ames, IA, (NVSL) has the charge to monitor all  serials of vaccines produced and marketed.  They have a surveillance of each manufacturer, testing from 10-18% of all serials on a random basis each year.  They can elect to test more often.  This cross check helps to insure that the products that are being sold in the animal markets meet the minimum requirements, and that all manufacturers are judged the same way.

Purity in vaccines is very important in protecting the animal populations from contaminated or worthless products.  Good manufacturing processes require that a high degree of testing at virtually every phase of production is essential.  Every serial of vaccine that is produced undergoes rigid purity testing before being released to the market.  A checks-and-balances system is in place as the USDA randomly tests serials of vaccines for purity.

This is normally one of the most expensive parts of developing vaccines.  It requires the procurement of susceptible animals; the disease that one is trying to protect against must be able to  be demonstrated, and the vaccine that is being developed must be able to protect against the disease when challenged.  Most all countries in the world which have regulations demand this type of scrutiny of vaccines.  One exception to this rule is the manufacture and use of autogenous vaccines.  Normally, it is know known how efficacious an autogenous vaccine is, but purity and safety  must always be demonstrated.

Immnuoglobulins are made by the animal in response to an invasion of something foreign into its body.  In normal animals, the immune response is very efficient and functional; in compromised animals the immune response can be weakened or even non existent.  It is for this reason that  one has be consider the vaccination of normal healthy animals in order for the vaccines to work properly.  Sometimes this is difficult to determine, but  none the less very important.

The N terminal is the area where the receptor sites of the immunoglobulin molecule recognizes an antigen.  IgG makes up approximately 80% of immunoglobulins in the blood stream of most animals.  IgG are usually the protective antibodies in response to an antigen.  They work usually by tying up antigens, thus making them more disposable to phagocytosis, or they may actually destroy antigens in conjunction with compliment agglutinate antigens, or otherwise neutralize an antigen.

IgM is usually the first response to an antigen,  Measuring IgM indicates a recent exposure to the antigen (either by infection or transitionally by vaccines).  IgM makes up about 20% of the immunoglobulin population in most animals.  IgM can be protective, but many times they are not.

This graph shows the  relationship of passively administered antibodies compared to actively produced antibodies.  The passive antibodies provide quick and immediate response to diseases, but the antibodies do not survive in the body for a very long period of time (usually 2-5 weeks).  Examples of passive antibodies are maternal antibodies passed from mother to offspring, and antiserums produced in a different animal, but administered to animals that are experiencing a disease.  Active antibodies are longer lasting and have a memory effect in that immunoglobulins are made faster and to a higher level each time an antigen is introduced  to the animal.

This definition is admittedly very simple, but does provide a clue to the function of adjuvants in vaccines.  These substances or materials are important in some vaccines to make them potent.  Otherwise, the animal that is given a vaccine may not be able to be stimulated sufficiently to mount a protective immune response.  Not all vaccines have adjuvants incorporated into  the formulations.  For example, most modified live vaccines do not have adjuvants incorporated into the product because the organisms are still alive, and capable of reproducing in the animal for a fairly long period of time.  In contrast, inactivated or non-living vaccines must have some way of stimulating the animal after injection for a long period of time.

These adjuvants are very popular in the veterinary vaccines as well as in human vaccines.  They have the capacity to stimulate an animal to respond to antigens more effectively, but most of the adjuvants are fairly non-reactive.  These adjuvants act as a depot for the vaccine at the injection site, so antigen is slowly released into the blood stream for processing.  Generally this allows the vaccine to produce an immunological response for a longer period of time.

Vegetable oils are metabolized by animals and serve as a good adjuvant in some vaccines.  The oils stimulate a strong response of white blood cells to the area of injection.  These cells take up the antigens that are located within this injection site to produce antibodies.  The draw back of the use of vegetable oil adjuvants is that they may not produce a strong enough effect for a long period of time.

Mineral oils or petroleum-based oils are remarkable in their ability to stimulate a strong response.  The oils are not metabolized by the animal very well, so they tend to stay at the injection site for a long period of time.  Many times one will notice a swelling at the site of injection of vaccines containing mineral oil adjuvants.  The swelling is caused by the irritation of the oil, causing a very strong migration of the white blood cells to the area.  Mineral oil adjuvants produce some of the most potent vaccines that can be manufactured.  For all of the advantages in using these adjuvants, there is a concern that these adjuvants can caused serious tissue damage in food producing animals, making the meat less desirable for human consumption.  With proper training and education the administration of oil vaccines can minimize any damage and still provide a highly efficacious vaccine to the animals.

Still other classes of materials have been used as adjuvants; many very successfully.  As can be seen in this slide, there have been some rather strange substances used by vaccinologists to improve the efficacy of their vaccines.

The question that must be answered is how does an adjuvant actually work.  Although not fully understood even now, there are some important clues as to how the incorporation of adjuvants into vaccines produce  better response in animals.

Adjuvants are usually  incorporated into inactivated vaccines to try and increase the immune responses of animal.  One of the disadvantages of using killed antigens is that the antigens are not able to propagate inside an animal and constantly stimulating the immune system.  Adjuvants try to  stimulate the immune system in the absence of proliferating antigens.  There are some modified live vaccines in the market today that actually  have adjuvants incorporated into the product.  This is done to attract the immune cells quicker, thus making certain vaccines even more efficient.  It is known also that if an antigen can be presented  to the immune system for a longer period of time, the immune stimulation is heightened.

Endotoxins are a potent compound derived from gram negative bacteria.  They possess good adjuvanting qualities, but they also can stimulate hypersensitivity reaction in animals.  Endotoxins are important in the immune responses, and if controlled in the right way, can be safe for use in animals.  Proper use of certain adjuvants helps to reduce the adverse effects of endotoxins by trapping the molecules and releasing them in a slow manner.

After vaccination, the immune system kicks into gear at the site of inoculation or where the antigen is introduced into the body.  The migration of  macrophages to the site is very important  in stimulating the immune response. Some of the observable reactions are a slight swelling with miler adjuvants to significant swellings with some of the oil adjuvants. There may be reddening at the injection site, but this is usually transient.

This drawing depict s the humeral cascade immune response.  Helper T cells help to process the antibody producing cells to make not only memory cells which last for a long period of time in the body (usually in the bone marrow), but also proliferate plasma cells to make antibodies to fight off infections.  Adjuvants can work at the antigen/macrophage  interface to stimulate the migration of greater numbers of  macrophages to process the antigens.

The t-cell or cell mediated immunity cascade is depicted by this cartoon.  The difference between the CMI responses and the Humeral responses is that the T-cells produce lymphokines which seek out and destroy antigens, as well as attracting macrophages to the antigens.  All of these activities are at the host cell level rather than in the circulatory system.  Certain adjuvants can be directed to induce or enhance the CMI  system rather than the Humeral system.  Some oil adjuvants function in this matter.

The important aspect to understand about adjuvants, is that there must be an irritation set up at the site of injection to stimulate the migration of white blood cells to the area to process antigen.  The absence on irritation can mean the loss of a potent immune response in an animal, especially for the traditional adjuvants.

Experimental studies have shown this relationship, in both human medicine as well as veterinary medicine.  The down side to this observation is the size of some of the swellings, especially with mineral oil adjuvants, causes some concern for the animal producer or veterinarian.  If very severe, other adverse reaction may also appear.

This graph illustrates the need to have only purified components in mineral oil adjuvants.  HIghly purified components result in less distress to animals.  The green line is ideal as animals (mice are used as the indicator of effect) gain weight at normal rates.  The red line demonstrates the short lag effect in weight gains after inoculation.  These components are still acceptable for use.  The blue line demonstrates components that have a negative effect on the mice, and are therefore not used in the production of vaccines.  This test, called the Berlin Test, is commonly used in vaccinology to screen oil components for vaccine formulation.

Some newer technologies employ sophisticated processing of antigens and oil components to produce a highly stable vaccine, with a minimum of adverse reaction in the animal after injection.  Although hard to make, multiple emulsion vaccines are some of the best on can obtain with oil adjuvants.  Not only is there a long depot effect of the adjuvant, there is a high level of immune stimulation in the recipient animal.

One of the common myths that people have concerning oil adjuvanted vaccines is described in the above slide.  It is important to understand that the adjuvant plays a very minor role in hypersensitivity reactions.  It is the antigen that is introduced into the animal that sets up these types of reactions in some animals.

At one time there was a big concern about the use of oil adjuvants and their ability to induce cancers in injected animals.  There was some truth to this concern in earlier times when unpurified oil components were used in vaccines. Todays technologies using highly purified oil components reduces the cancer causing fear significantly.

This chart is very important in understanding the effects of vaccine failure as most producers  describe.   The important aspect of this chart is that many other factors are responsible for the apparent failure of any vaccine, while actual failure of vaccine represents a small  portion of the problems.

This short definition of bacteria may help one to differentiate the difference between bacteria (and on the next slide) viruses.  Other modules going into more depth of bacteria, their physiology, and ability to grow can be viewed to get a more thorough understanding of this science.

Viruses are much smaller than bacteria.  They cannot be seen under conventional microscopes (they require the used of electron microscopes).  Never the less, some very important economic diseases are caused by viruses, and their are effective vaccines to prevent diseases caused by these small organisms.

It is hoped that you may have gained some information about the use of adjuvants in the veterinary vaccine industry.  Of course one can go into greater in depth detail in virtually every aspect that was presented in this module.  You are invited to explore areas of interest to gain more understanding.

<h3>The company-logo of Boehringer Ingelheim</h3>

<center>
<img  src="images/logo.jpg" width=340 height=65 border=3>
</center>
<p>



The development of the company-logo during the past century. From the start of the

company to how it is used today. 

<P>



The logo of Boehringer Ingelheim is based on the central part of the imperial palace

of Charlemagne, who stayed in Ingelheim towards the end of the 8th century. His

first documented stay here was in 774.

<P>

A model of the Ingelheim imperial palace with the central section which has become famous throughout the district: this was the basis of the company logo.

<P>

At this moment Boehringer Ingelheim is working on a new corporate design, which will also include a change in the company logo.

<h3>Vision-statement on Value</h3>
<h4>Value will be our competitive advantage, 
our customers demand more for less.</h4>
The customers are objective, professional and more analytical. They have a balanced view of purchasing. 
The value of our customers demand is changing and will conyinue to change. We need to anticipate the 
value our customers will place on our products and services now and in the future. We will only be able to 
exceed our customers' expectations by being closer to them. We have to share their values, aspirations and 
problems. We need to understand how they use our products, how we can make them more efficient and 
effective and answer the needs of their customers. The closer we all are to our customers the easier it will be. 
We have to bring down the barriers between them and us and between ourselves. We have to be one group 
with a shared objective.

<h3>Vision-statement on Innovation</h3>
<h4>Innovation in everything will be our challenge. <BR>
We will only deliver outstanding value to our customers if we are innovative in everything we do.
</h4>
Our commitment is not to innovation for innovation's sake. Nor is our commitment simply to innovation in the research laboratory, but to every aspect of or business. We need to find innovative approaches to every task, every process and every role in the organisation. Everyone in the business can make a difference. Everyone can deliver greater value to their collegues, to their team, to their department and as a result to our customers. For us, value through innovation is not restricted to quantum leaps. We recognise that we can seem a small change to us may deliver enormous value to our customers. Innovation is an attitude and a way of life.

<H2>25 million dollar investment / ground-breaking ceremony for new pharmaceutical plant in Shanghai</H2>
<h3>Joint venture between Boehringer Ingelheim and SPC 
making swift progress</H3>
</CENTER>
In Pudong industrial estate just outside Shanghai the foundation stone has been laid for a new pharmaceutical plant to be run as a joint venture between Boehringer Ingelheim and its Chinese partner Sine Pharmaceuticals Corporation Limited (SPC), Shanghai. The ground-breaking ceremony was attended by prominent representatives of the Chinese authorities as well as by the Chairman of the Board, Dr Heribert Johann, and Dr Hans-Jrgen Leuchs, responsible for Corporate Board Division Technology and Pharmaceutical Manufacture in Ingelheim.
<P>
With the laying of the foundation stone for the new pharmaceutical production plant at an estimated investment volume of 25 million dollars, the Chinese-German partners have made rapid progress in connection with the joint venture founded in February of this year under the name of Shanghai Boehringer Ingelheim Sine Pharmaceuticals Corp. Ltd (SBISPL). As stipulated in the agreements, Boehringer Ingelheim will bear 60 percent of the total investment with SPC assuming the remaining 40 percent. The new pharmaceutical plant which will house production of a wide range of dosage forms such as ampoules, solutions, tablets and capsules, is due to start up operations in 1998.
<P>
The Boehringer Ingelheim Corporation expects the joint venture in Shanghai, which will benefit from SPC's indepth knowledge of the rapidly growing pharmaceutical market in the People's Republic of China, built up since its establishment in 1924, to generate further impetus for the pharma market in the economic area of Asia.

<H2>Boehringer Ingelheim and ISIS reach first milestone for ISIS 2302</H2>
</CENTER>
Results of the first Phase IIa clinical trial of ISIS 2302, in Crohn's disease, a form of inflammatory bowel disease, have encouraged Boehringer Ingelheim and Isis Pharmaceuticals to initiate a large, well-controlled, pivotal quality Phase IIb trial in the first quarter of 1997.
<P>
Boehringer Ingelheim made a milestone payment of $10 million to Isis Pharmaceuticals  for the completion of this first Phase IIa clinical trial of ISIS 2302. The payment comes in the form of an equity investment by Boehringer Ingelheim in Isis.
<P> 
ISIS 2302 is a key asset in the Boehringer Ingelheim/Isis collaboration in cell adhesion molecule-targeted drug discovery, development and commercialization, formed in 1995. ISIS 2302 is an antisense inhibitor of the production of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), a protein implicated in a broad range of inflammatory diseases. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trials were initiated in late 1995 and early 1996 in five indications - kidney transplant rejection, Crohn's disease, ulcerative  colitis, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Results from the Phase IIa trials in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis and kidney transplant rejection are anticipated over the next several months.
<P>
"Both Isis and Boehringer Ingelheim are very pleased to have reached this critical milestone in the development of ISIS 2302, and that the data from the Crohn's disease trials support the initiation of pivotal Phase IIb trials in this indication. We look forward to the completion of the four remaining Phase IIa trials," said Daniel Kisner, M.D., President and Chief Operating Officer at Isis. "We are especially encouraged by the indication that ISIS 2302 warrants additional testing as a treatment for Crohn's disease, one of the most debilitating and difficult to treat forms of inflammatory bowel disease. We expect to present the results of our Crohn's disease study in a scientific forum in the near future."
<P>
"These latest results for ISIS 2302 in Crohn's disease provide confirmation for Boehringer Ingelheim's interest in the therapeutic application of antisense compounds for inflammatory disease states", said Professor Rolf Krebs, Vice Chairman of the Boehringer Ingelheim Board of Managing Directors, who is responsible for the division Pharmaceuticals. "These results bring us one step closer to offering advanced therapeutic solutions."
<P>

<H2>BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM AND NOVO NORDISK SIGN RESEARCH AGREEMENT INTO DRUG TREATMENT OF OBESITY</H2>

</CENTER>

Boehringer Ingelheim and Novo Nordisk announce that they have entered into a multi-year agreement on research into drug treatment of obesity. Obesity plays a major role in the development of Type 2 diabetes, or maturity-onset diabetes, which typically occurs in adults above the age of 40.
<P>
The research agreement is focused on the discovery of new drugs which influence receptors on cells in the brain or in fat cells, thereby regulating food intake, energy expenditure or the number of fat cells, thus decreasing the fat accumulation in obese people.
<P>
The research agreement is supplemented by a basic framework for development and marketing which determines a fifty-fifty split of cost and profit sharing principle. All patents resulting from the collaboration will be jointly owned.
<P>
Bruce Carter, Corporate Executive Vice President, Novo Nordisk's Health Care Discovery and Development, says: "The collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim is another cornerstone in strengthening Diabetes Care, one of our core business areas. The know-how and technologies of our two companies complement each other perfectly. Therefore, we look forward to using our know-how and capacity in a way that will improve the development of drugs for the benefit of obese people with diabetes."
<P>
Prof. Rolf Krebs, Vice Chairman of the Board of Managing Directors of Boehringer Ingelheim and responsible for Corporate Board Division Pharma, commented: "Novo Nordisk, one of the world leaders in insulin and the treatment of diabetes and the biggest manufacturer of industrial enzymes in the world, is a welcome and strong partner who is highly eligible to support us in implementing our plans in the field of obesity." 
<P>
Novo Nordisk A/S is the world leader in insulin and diabetes care and also manufactures and markets a variety of other pharmaceutical products. Furthermore the company is the world's largest producer of industrial enzymes. Headquartered in Denmark, Novo Nordisk employs approximately 13,400 people in 54 countries and markets its products in 130 countries.
<P>
An international corporation with headquarters in Ingelheim (Germany), Boehringer Ingelheim operates in the pharmaceutical, biological, and chemical sectors. The  Boehringer Ingelheim Corporation is represented on every continent, with about 160 companies around the world. With its own research, production and distribution facilities, it ranks among the top 20 pharmaceutical companies in the world.

<CENTER><H2> Boehringer Ingelheim baut Forschung in Biberach aus 19,2 Millionen DM fr Toxikologie-Neubau
</H2>
</CENTER>
Im Zuge der Erweiterung der Pharma-Forschungs- und -entwicklungskapazitten bei der zum Unternehmensverband Boehringer Ingelheim gehrenden Dr. Karl ThomaeGmbH, Biberach/Riss, hat die Unternehmensleitung Investitionen von insgesamt 19,2 Millionen DM freigegeben; sie werden im wesentlichen fr die Errichtung eines zweigeschossigen Gebudetraktes verwendet, der unter anderem moderne Laboratorien fr die Aufklrung des toxikologischen Profils neuer Pharmawirkstoffe aufnehmen wird. Mit der Fertigstellung des Neubaus mit einer Nutzflche von 1.730 Quadratmetern wird im Sptherbst 1997 gerechnet. Anschlieend werden die bestehenden Laboratorien der Abteilung Experimentelle Pathologie und Toxikologie (EPT) umgebaut und modernisiert. Nach Fertigstellung werden insgesamt rund 100 qualifizierte Arbeitspltze zur Verfgung stehen.
<p>
Der Anschub des Projekts Neubau Toxikologie ist ein weiterer Beitrag zum Ausbau von Thomae als einem der Kernstandorte fr Pharmaforschung und -entwicklung im weltweiten Forschungsverbund des Unternehmensverbandes Boehringer Ingelheim.

<CENTER><H2> Boehringer Ingelheim: FDA erteilt erste Lizenz fr 
Biotechnik-Mehrzweckanlage in Europa</H2>
</CENTER>
Eine der grten weltweit lizensierten Biotechnik-Mehrzweck-Produktionsanlagen (Multi Product Plant) steht bei dem zum Unternehmensverband Boehringer Ingelheim gehrenden Pharmaproduzenten Thomae, Biberach/Riss. Nach einer mehrtgigen Inspektion durch die US-amerikanische Arzneimittelzulassungsbehrde FDA (Federal Drug Administration), die wegen ihrer strengen Prfungsanforderungen Mastbe setzt, hatte der Biberacher Pharmahersteller das begehrte Zertifikat erhalten. Damit wird dem Unternehmen nunmehr auch der Zugang zum bedeutenden nordamerikanischen Markt fr biotechniche High-Tech-Produkte sowohl aus dem eigenen Unternehmensverband als auch fr Biotechnikprodukte aus den Geschftsfeldern Lizenzprodukte ("Inlicensed Products") und Auftragsentwicklung ("Cooperative Manufacturing") erffnet.
<P>
Auslser der FDA-Inspektion waren die erfolgreichen Aktivitten zur Registrierung von Verluma, einem Arbeitskit zur in-vivo-Diagnose des kleinzelligen Lungenkarzinoms. Mit der Einfhrung des Diagnosemittels auf dem US-amerikanischen Markt durch den Marketingpartner DuPont Merck Radiopharmazeutika wird in Krze gerechnet.
<P>
Europas modernstes Biotechnikum mit rund 250 qualifizierten Arbeitspltzen war im November 1986 nach Investitionen von rund 150 Millionen DM in Betrieb genommen worden. Seither wurde der Biotechnikkomplex in Biberach mit weiteren Aufwendungen in der Grenordnung von 30 Millionen DM zur Mehrzweck-Produktionsanlage fr Biopharmazeutika ausgebaut.
<P>
Produkt der ersten Stunde war das 1987 weltweit zugelassene Prparat Actilyse zur Therapie des akuten Herzinfarkts, das inzwischen auch fr die Behandlung der Lungenembolie zugelassen ist. Neben diesem Anti-Thrombus-Mittel, mit dem Boehringer Ingelheim im Geschftsjahr 1995 Gesamterlse von gut 200 Millionen DM erwirtschaftete, werden bei Thomae eine ganze Reihe anderer gentechnisch gewonnener Substanzen biotechnisch hergestellt, so auch fr die Berliner ScheringAG das in der jngsten Vergangenheit zugelassene Prparat Betaferon zur Behandlung der schubfrmig verlaufenden Multiplen Sklerose.

<P>
In dem Umwelt-Report werden fr das Gesamtunternehmen Umweltschutz- und Sicherheitsergebnisse fr die Jahre 1993 bis 1995 verffentlicht, an denen man jetzt auch feststellen kann, inwieweit der Unternehmensverband in der jngsten Vergangenheit die Werte in den Bereichen Umweltschutz und Sicherheit verbessern konnte. So ist die anfallende Aballmenge im Zeitraum 1993 bis 1995 relativ zur Produktion um 12 Prozent gesenkt, die Recyclingquote auf ber 60 Prozent erhht worden. Bei den meldepflichtigen Arbeitsunfllen konnte im gleichen Zeitraum eine Verringerung um 25 Prozent erreicht werden.
<P>
Bis zum Jahre 2000 will der Unternehmensverband die Emissionen organischer Verbindungen in die Luft um 20 Prozent und die Gesamtabfallmenge um 15 Prozent reduzieren. Ferner soll - ebenfalls bis zum Jahre 2000 - der Energie- und Wasserverbrauch um 20 beziehungsweise 15 Prozent abgesenkt werden.
<P>										
Boehringer Ingelheim, das sich dem internationalen Responsible Care-Programm und einer stetigen Verbesserung von Umweltschutz und Sicherheit verpflichtet hat, investierte 1995 rund 40 Millionen DM (neun Prozent der Gesamtinvestitionen) fr Umweltschutzanlagen. Die Umweltschutz-Betriebskosten des Unternehmensverbandes lagen 1995 bei 70 Millionen DM, wovon etwa 30MillionenDM in Deutschland anfielen.
<P>
Insgesamt sind weltweit bei Boehringer Ingelheim gut 400 Mitarbeiter mit Umweltschutz- und Sicherheitsaufgaben betraut, die von rund 800 freiwilligen Sicherheits- und Feuerwehr-Krften untersttzt werden.
<P>
Neben der qualifizierten Beratung von Produktion und Technik, Forschung und Verwaltung ist das Auditieren ein unverzichtbares Instrument der Umweltschutz- und Sicherheitsarbeit. Boehringer Ingelheim hat bereits 1992 ein weltweites Umweltschutz- und Sicherheits-Audit-Programm mit 20 thematischen Modulen eingefhrt. Im Rahmen dieses Programms, das durch Inspektionen vor Ort und gezielte berprfungen begleitet wird, wurden ber 30 chemische und pharmazeutische Betriebe des Unternehmensverbandes auditiert. Ziel des Audit-Systems von Boehringer Ingelheim ist eine ganzheitliche Betrachtung und Bewertung aller sicherheits- und umweltschutzrelevanter Prozesse. Damit sollen auch staatliche Institutionen von Kontrollaufgaben durch Kontrolle in Eigenverantwortung entlastet werden.
<P>
Der Konzern-Umwelt-Bericht 1995 des Ingelheimer Unternehmensverbandes liegt in deutscher und englischer Sprache vor. Interessenten knnen ihn unter (Telefon:06132/77-20 90) anfordern.

<H2>Boehringer Ingelheim (Canada) Ltd. (BICL) announces five year, 
$10 Million high technology Investment in Ontario.
Twenty-one Permanent skilled Jobs created. </H2>
</Blockquote>



<P>

(Burlington, Ont.) --  Boehringer Ingelheim (Canada) Ltd. announced today the decision of its parent company Boehringer Ingelheim International, based in Germany, to invest approximately $10 million over a period of five years to establish a North American Information Technology "Centre of Excellence" at its Canadian headquarters in Burlington.  Ontario Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism, the Honourable William Saunderson participated in the announcement ceremony and delivered the keynote address.
<P>
Dr. Engelbert Gnster, BICL President and CEO commented that "the Regional Computing and Resource Centre will optimize and consolidate the information technology resource for Boehringer Ingelheim companies in North America across the functions of Customer Service, Finance, Distribution and Technological Pharmaceutical Manufacturing.  This will result in improved, efficient and cost-effective services for Boehringer Ingelheim's internal and external customers."
<P>
The initiative announced today is part of a larger Boehringer Ingelheim North American program to improve the way the company does business in Canada, Mexico and the United States.  By the end of the century, the Centre will provide information technology support for nine Boehringer Ingelheim company locations in North America.
<P>
While a portion of the new Centre will be implemented during the fourth quarter of 1996, it is expected to be officially open and operational by April 1, 1997.  There will occur a one-time initial investment of approximately $1/2 million and an on-going annual expenditure of approximately 2.8 million dollars per annum once fully functional by the end of 1999.  
<P>
More importantly, the Centre will create 21 permanent high technology/skilled labour positions in Ontario.
<P>
"This exciting initiative, by this leading worldwide pharmaceutical company, represents a tremendous contribution to Ontario" said Economic Development, Trade and Tourism Minister William Saunderson.  "By locating its Regional Computing and Resource Centre here in Burlington, Boehringer Ingelheim underscores Ontario's reputation as a centre for job creation, investment, high technology and excellence in the pharmaceutical industry."
<P>
Several locations in North America were considered for the Centre.  However, based on the results of extensive research into a number of different criteria including skilled labour availability, stability of infrastructure, cost of implementation, and current experience with Business Planning and Control System programs, Boehringer Ingelheim's Canadian headquarters in Burlington was chosen as the preferred site.

<H2>BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM SIGNS FOUR YEAR



$41.6 MILLION RESEARCH AGREEMENT WITH ONTOGEN



</H2>



<B>Partnership seeks to develop new technology to speed drug discovery</B>



</CENTER>



<P>



Management of Carlsbad-based Ontogen Corporation (California, USA) announced today that the Company has entered into an alliance with German-based pharmaceutical corporation Boehringer Ingelheim to jointly develop new automated hardware and software technologies for high-speed synthesis and purification of diverse chemical compounds for use in drug discovery activities. Under terms of the agreement, Ontogen will receive $41.6 million in research and development and milestone payments from Boehringer Ingelheim over a four year period. In return, Boehringer Ingelheim will receive exclusive rights to certain technologies emanating from the research agreement, as well as first right of negotiation on drug candidates resulting from undisclosed funded research.



<P>



"This agreement is another clear indication of the technological expertise Ontogen has established in compound synthesis and purification," said Barry Toyonaga, Ph.D., Ontogen President and Chief Executive Officer. "We are extremely pleased to partner with a company devoted to research and development such as Boehringer Ingelheim and we look forward to developing state-of-the-art technology that will help both companies discover new and exciting drug candidates."



<P>



"As we look to the future of drug discovery, we recognize that highly efficient methods of synthesis, testing and analysis of pure chemical samples will dramatically accelerate the drug discovery process," said Professor Rolf Krebs, Member of the Board of Managing Directors of Boehringer Ingelheim and responsible for the Corporate Board Division Pharma. "We believe that Ontogen's expertise in automation and compound synthesis technology coupled with Boehringer's expertise in solid and liquid phase chemistry will allow us to jointly create a state-of-the-art system for synthesizing and purifying compounds much more rapidly and efficiently than can be accomplished today."



<P>



Ontogen is a leader in the development of highly efficient methods of chemical synthesis, compound analysis, biological screening and data analysis. The Company applies its proprietary technology to chemical-based drug discovery for a variety of indications, including cancer, immune disorders and inflammation.



<P>



Boehringer Ingelheim is an international corporation with headquarters in Ingelheim, Germany, operating in the fields of pharmaceutical, biological, and chemical products. With about 160 companies, the Boehringer Ingelheim Corporation is represented on every continent. With its own research, production and distribution facilities it ranks among the 20 major pharmaceutical companies worldwide.

<H2>BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM INVESTS ADDITIONAL



$10 MILLION IN CAMBRIDGE NEUROSCIENCE



</H2>







Equity Purchase Reflects Advancement of CERESTAT<font size=1></font>  into Pivotal Trials for two



Clinical Indications



<P>



</CENTER>



Boehringer Ingelheim and Cambridge NeuroScience today announced that Boehringer Ingelheim is expanding its investment in Cambridge NeuroScience with the purchase of $10 million of Cambridge NeuroScience common stock. The investment follows the initiation in July of this year of a pivotal trial of CERESTAT<font size=1></font> in stroke patients, and the start of a pivotal trial in traumatic brain injury in March. The 900 patient international placebo controlled stroke trial was announced by the companies in July. Earlier this year, Cambridge NeuroScience and Boehringer Ingelheim started a separate pivotal trial of CERESTAT<font size=1></font> in patients with traumatic brain injury.



<P>



Boehringer Ingelheim is purchasing 1,237,624 shares of the common stock of Cambridge NeuroScience at a price of $8.08 per share. At the closing of the transaction, which is expected to take place in several weeks, Boehringer Ingelheim will own approximately 17% of Cambridge NeuroScience.



<P>



"This investment reflects the progress that the companies have made developing CERESTAT and Boehringer Ingelheim's confidence in Cambridge NeuroScience as a development partner," said Burkhard Blank, M.D., Head of International Project Management, of Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH.



<P>										



To date, over 450 patients and volunteers have participated in CERESTAT clinical trials over the last three years, including more than 350 treated with CERESTAT. The drug acts to prevent nerve cell death and brain damage following head injury or stroke by preventing excessive entry of calcium into nerve cells. It is known that nerve cell death following a serious head injury or stroke is triggered by excessive glutamate released from damaged nerve terminals, which stimulates the massive entry of calcium into nerve cells. There are approximately 500,000 victims of stroke in the United States annually. No effective drug therapy is available to treat these patients, or to prevent the nerve cell damage that occurs subsequent to a stroke or traumatic brain injury.



<P>



"The alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim has met all our strategic objectives for advancing the development of our lead product, and the two development teams have collaborated extremely well from day one," said Elkan Gamzu, Ph.D., Cambridge NeuroScience President and Chief Executive Officer. "We're extremely proud of their continued confidence in Cambridge NeuroScience and enthusiastic about the expanded commitment on both sides."



<P>



Cambridge NeuroScience and Boehringer Ingelheim entered into a collaboration in March of 1995 to jointly develop CERESTAT for stroke and traumatic brain injury. Under the terms of the collaborative agreement, Boehringer Ingelheim pays for at least 75% of the development costs and has exclusive marketing rights, subject to a royalty. Cambridge NeuroScience has the right to co-promote the product in the United States.



<P>



Cambridge NeuroScience, Inc. is a leading neuroscience company engaged in the discovery and development of proprietary pharmaceuticals to treat serious disorders of the nervous systems. The Company is developing a number of products to treat stroke, traumatic brain injury and chronic neurodegenerative disorders including multiple sclerosis and other neuropathies.



<P>



Boehringer Ingelheim is an international corporation with headquarters in Ingelheim, Germany, operating in the fields of pharmaceutical, biological, and chemical products. With about 160 companies, the Boehringer Ingelheim Corporation is represented on every continent. With its own research, production and distribution facilities it ranks among the 20 major pharmaceutical companies worldwide.



<P>											 



This press release contains forward-looking statements based on the current expectations of management. There are certain important factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated by the statements made above, including, but not limited to, the continued funding of the Company's development program from Boehringer Ingelheim under the Boehringer Ingelheim collaborative agreement, the rate of enrollment of patients in the Company's current and future clinical trials, and the acceptance by regulatory authorities of the Company's clinical trial outcomes as a basis for marketing approval.

<H2>FDA LICENSES VERLUMA<Font Size=1>TM</font> <BR>   SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER IMAGING KIT



</H2>



-NeoRx Receives $4.5 Million Milestone-



<P>



</CENTER>



The NeoRx Corporation (Nasdaq:NERX) today announced that the Food and Drug Administration licensed Verluma <font size=1>tm</FONT>, (kit for preparation of Technetium Tc 99 Nofetumomab Merpentan). Developed by Neo Rx, Verluma is a monoclonal antibody-based  diagnostic imaging agent used to determine the stage of disease in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). NeoRx thereby received a $4.5 million milestone payment from The DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Company, whose Radiopharmaceutical Division will market Verluma in North America, and pay NeoRx royalties on sales. Dr. Karl Thomae  GmbH (Biberach, Germany) an affiliate of Boehringer Ingelheim (Ingelheim, Germany), brought the manufacturing process to a commercial scale and successfully completed registration as the holder of the Biologics License to manufacture Verluma. 



<P>



Verluma is composed of a monoclonal antibody Fab fragment, linked by NeoRx's proprietary technology to Technetium Tc 99m, the most widely used diagnostic radionuclide. It was recommended for licensure by the Oncology Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) in December 1995.



<P>



"We are certainly very pleased with these developments," said Paul Abrams, M.D., J.D., NeoRx president and CEO. "We commend Thomae for efficiently handling their Biologics License Application. We now look forward to Verluma helping patients and physicians with critical decisions regarding choice of therapy and prognosis while also providing cost saving opportunities."



<P>



Verluma determines whether a SCLC patient has extensive stage disease (approximately 70% of all SCLC patients); patients with extensive disease receive  only chemotherapy, because the addition of expensive and toxic radiation does not improve their 3% long-term, disease free survival chances. Small cell lung cancer patients with limited disease are treated with chemotherapy and radiation and have a 20% or greater chance of long-term, disease free survival. Thus, determining stage has a major impact on therapy and prognosis.



<P>



A different formulation of the antibody used in Verluma is incorporated in NeoRx's Avicidin <Font Size=1></Font> product under development. Avicidin has shown promise in the treatment of certain tumor types in Phase I/II clinical trials.



<P>



NeoRx Corporation, headquartered in Seattle, develops targeted therapeutic products to treat oncologic and cardiovascular disease. Its lead therapeutic products under development, Avicidin and Biostent <font size=1>TM</font>  are in Phase I/II clinical trials.

<B>1  August, 1996</B>

<H2>Boehringer Ingelheim gives up research centre in Milan</H2>



</CENTER>







The Board of Managing Directors of Boehringer Ingelheim, one of the biggest German research-based pharmaceutical and chemical companies in the world with research and development (R&D) spending of over DM 1 billion (1995), has decided to continue its concentration of R&D activities with the closure of the research centre based in Milan which currently employs a staff of around 100. Details are still being negotiated with the company and the Italian chemical trade union. 



<P>



One major criterion swaying this decision was the restructuring of research and development strategies embarked upon at Boehringer Ingelheim some time ago; these foresee stepping up commitment in the USA and concentrating the research centres operating in Europe. 



<P>



A further pivotal consideration in the decision to give up research in Italy are the increasingly more difficult conditions which have been facing the research-based pharmaceutical industry in Italy over the last few years; this led to a slump in the price of drugs of more than 20 percent between 1992 and 1995. This situation is further compounded by the steady rise in the rate of inflation to almost 19 percent and the negative exchange rate of the lira/DM. These developments have had an extremely adverse effect on Boehringer Ingelheim business in Italy over the past years. 



<P>



The deteriorating pharmapolitical situation in Italy which has made it impossible in recent years to finance R&D fully from Boehringer Ingelheim business in Italy confirmed the company in its decision to discontinue research and development in Italy.

<B>26 June 1996</B>



<CENTER>



<H2>Boehringer Ingelheim announces a $14 million investment in innovative research & development resulting in the expansion of the Bio-Mga/ Boehringer Ingelheim Research Inc.'s facility in Laval, Quebec.



</H2>



</CENTER>



<B>Laval, June 26, 1996</B> - Dr. Paul C. Anderson, President of Bio-Mga/Boehringer Ingelheim Research  Inc., announced today an additional investment of $14 million dollars by the parent company Boehringer Ingelheim, increasing their significant research & development commitment in Quebec. This investment will result in the expansion of the Bio-Mga/Boehringer Ingelheim Research Inc. facilities located in Laval. Bio-Mga is Boehringer Ingelheim's center of competence in virology research and is dedicated to the discovery of new therapeutic agents that will provide crucial advantages and benefits to patients, doctors, and the health care system.



<P>



Dr. Anderson explained that of the investment of approximately $14 million, approximately $9 million will be used for the construction of the facility and $5 million for the purchase of research equipment. Since the current surface area of 61,000 square feet of the Bio-Mga facilities is already being utilized to its full capacity and will not be enough space to accommodate further growth, the facility will have to be expanded by nearly 30%. The new two-story, 145 by 69 foot building will be similar to the existing facility. It will include biochemistry laboratories, specialized equipment rooms, analytical chemistry laboratories and a highly advanced magnetic resonance scanning laboratory.



<P>



The expansion and research investment will position Bio-Mega/Boehringer Ingelheim Research Inc. as Canada's premier privately held pharmaceutical research facility. Since its foundation in 1984 by the Socit gnrale de financement du Qubec, an industrial holding company operated by the provincial government whose objective is to diversify the Quebec economy through advanced technology, Bio-Mga has employed a multi-disciplinary team composed of approximately nearly one hundred scientists.



<P>



Dr. Anderson was joined by Dr. Engelbert Gnster, President and CEO of Boehringer Ingelheim (Canada) Ltd. who confirmed that with this investment, Boehringer Ingelheim International has demonstrated confidence in the quality of research conducted in the Quebec facility. Several important dignitaries participated in the announcement including: the Vice-Premier and Minister of State for Economics and Finance, Mr. Bernard Landry, the President of Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrasturcture, the Hon. Marcel Masse, the Mayor of Laval, Gilles Vaillancourt, as well as many medical, scientific and business leaders in Quebec.

<H2> VIRAMUNE<font size =1> </font> RECEIVES ACCELERATED APPROVAL<BR> TO TREAT AIDS</H2>







<H3>Represents first drug in class to receive designation</H3>



</CENTER>











Rockville, MD -- June 24, 1996 -- The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today announced that it has granted accelerated approval for VIRAMUNE<font size=1></font> (nevirapine) for use in combination with nucleoside analogues for the treatment of HIV infected adults who have experienced clinical and/or immunologic deterioration.  VIRAMUNE is the first member of the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor class of compounds, which has a different mechanism of action and a distinct side effect profile than currently marketed agents.  Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed its new drug application (NDA) with the FDA on February 23, 1996.  VIRAMUNE is expected to be available by August.



<P>



	"We have much to learn about the most effective combination therapies.  VIRAMUNE adds a new option to combination therapy and provides physicians with the first of a new class of drugs to treat HIV infection," said Dr. Andreas Barner, Head of the Corporate Medical Division at Boehringer Ingelheim.	



<P>



	According to Prof. Rolf Krebs, Vice Chairman of the Board at Boehringer Ingelheim and responsible for the Corporate Board Division Pharma, adds VIRAMUNE "a new and valuable product to Boehringer Ingelheim's product portfolio."  The company seeks to gain approval for VIRAMUNE in Europe and other countries as quickly as possible.



<P>







	Accelerated approval is a regulatory mechanism which allows the FDA to grant early marketing status for a product based on laboratory markers such as CD4 cell counts (a reflection of immune system strength) rather than on clinical endpoints such as disease progression.  Clinical benefit must eventually be demonstrated for products receiving accelerated approval.  Trials designed to demonstrate the clinical benefit of VIRAMUNE in combination with other antiretrovirals are ongoing.  VIRAMUNE has been studied in humans since 1991.  



<P>



	Clearance for marketing of VIRAMUNE was based primarily on data from two major clinical trials enrolling 549 HIV-infected adults.  The first study, ACTG 241, was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial, in which researchers followed 398 patients for 48 weeks at 16 participating investigational sites.  All patients entering the study had advanced HIV infection with CD4 cell counts of less than or equal to 350 (mean CD4 cell count for these patients was 153).  The study compared the combination of AZT, ddI and VIRAMUNE to the combination of AZT, ddI and placebo.  Patients in this trial had received extensive prior nucleoside therapy.  The ACTG 241 study found that the combination of AZT, ddI and VIRAMUNE increased CD4 cell count significantly more than the AZT, ddI and placebo combination.  In a substudy of ACTG 241, viral load was measured.  In these patients the combination of AZT, ddI and VIRAMUNE reduced the viral load significantly more than AZT, ddI and placebo throughout the 48 weeks of the trial.  The clinical significance of changes in viral RNA has not been established.



<P>



	The second study, BI 1046, an international randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, investigated VIRAMUNE in previously untreated patients.  The six month results from this twelve month study were recently reported.  The study compared the combinations of AZT, ddI and VIRAMUNE; AZT and ddI; and AZT and VIRAMUNE in 151 HIV-1 infected patients with entry CD4 counts between 200 and 600. Patients randomized to AZT plus ddI plus VIRAMUNE as well as those receiving AZT plus ddI had improvements in CD4 counts through 24 weeks which remained significantly above baseline; however there was no significant difference between these arms.  The triple drug regimen containing VIRAMUNE decreased the viral load below the limit of detection in over 70 percent of the patients, which was significantly greater than either double therapy regimen.  Twelve month data is currently being analyzed.  At present, there are no results from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effects of VIRAMUNE with nucleoside analogues on the clinical progression of HIV-1 infection, such as the incidence of opportunistic infections or survival.



<P>



	The major clinical toxicity of VIRAMUNE is rash, with VIRAMUNE attributable rash occurring in 17% of patients in combination regimens in controlled studies.  Severe and life-threatening skin reaction have occurred in patients treated with VIRAMUNE including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS).  Overall, severe rash occurred in 7.6% of VIRAMUNE patients versus 1.2% of controls.  Patients who develop severe rash usually do so within the first 28 days.  A lead-in dose of one 200 mg tablet per day for two weeks has been shown to reduce the incidence of rash.  The standard maintenance dose is one 200 mg tablet taken twice a day.  Other common adverse events were fever, nausea, headache, and increases in liver enzymes.



<P>



	Since March of this year, the drug has been available to patients through an expanded access program, which allows access to promising drugs for serious diseases prior to marketing approval.  There will be a transition period for those patients enrolled in the expanded access program.  The company shortly will announce plans for a reimbursement assistance program.



<P>



	VIRAMUNE is a product of original research at Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., located in Ridgefield, CT.  In addition to Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, two other affiliate companies of Boehringer Ingelheim Corporation (Ridgefield, CT) -- BI Chemicals, Inc. (Petersburg, VA) and Roxane Laboratories, Inc. (Columbus, OH) -- are collaborating in the introduction of VIRAMUNE.  This collaboration capitalizes on Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals' extensive development and clinical capabilities, BI Chemicals' strength in the production of fine chemical substances, and Roxane Laboratories experience in the HIV/AIDS arena.  Boehringer Ingelheim Corporation is a member of the Boehringer Ingelheim worldwide group of companies, based in Ingelheim, Germany.  A privately-held company, founded in 1885, Boehringer Ingelheim is a major pharmaceutical, chemical, animal health, and bakery products manufacturer with operations in more than 100 countries around the world.

<H2>ANSAN, INC. ANNOUNCES ACQUISITION OF RIGHTS



TO DRUG FOR PANCREATITIS FROM BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM</H2>



</CENTER>







<B>ANSAN, INC. (NASDAQ, ANSNU, ANSN)</B> today announced that it has signed a licensing agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim to acquire the rights in the United States and the European Union to develop a new intravenous formulation of the drug apafant for all clinical indications. Apafant is a patented antagonist of platelet activating factor. Ansan said that its first clinical target would be acute pancreatitis.



<P>



Professor Rolf Krebs, Member of the Board of Managing Directors of Boehringer Ingelheim and responsible for the Corporate Board Division Pharma, said "We see this agreement with Ansan as a cost-effective means for rapidly expanding development activities for drugs originally discovered by Boehringer Ingelheim. Ansan assures responsibility for developing an intravenous formulation of apafant for new indications. Both companies have significant upside potential as a result."



<P>



In the United States and Europe, approximately 400,000 patients each year are diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. Approximately 15 % of these patients die. Currently there is no specific drug therapy available for this disease. Ansan indicates that antagonism of platelet activating factor has already been shown in animal studies to ameliorate the disorder and to reduce mortality.



<P>



Ansan has previously stated that one of its strategies for building its portfolio would be the acquisition of rights to develop existing drugs for new indications. "This agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim validates a key element of Ansan's business strategy," said Dr. Mark Moran, Ansan's President and CEO. "Boehringer Ingelheim has extensively evaluated the oral formulation of apafant in preclinical and clinical studies for other indications. As a result, we believe that Ansan will be able to initiate efficacy studies in patients with pancreatitis with its intravenous formulation immediately after filing the IND."



<P>



Ansan is currently engaged in the research and development of a number of patented small molecules intended to treat cancer, blood disorders, and other life-threatening diseases such as acute pancreatitis. Ansan acquires drugs through strategic inlicensing and then rapidly develops these new product opportunities to proof-of-efficacy in humans.



<P>



This press release contains forward-looking statements, involving risks and uncertainties that may or may not be identifiable in advance. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated. Apafant may prove to be ineffective or unsafe in treating pancreatitis or other disorders. Regulatory authorities may not share management's views regarding clinical planning. In addition, successful signing of the current agreement does not mean that additional, similar agreements for other products will follow. There may be additional risks. Interested parties are urged to review the risks detailed from time to time in Ansan reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1995, and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 1996.



<P>



Boehringer Ingelheim is an international corporation with headquarters in Ingelheim, Germany, operating in the fields of pharmaceutical, biological, and chemical products. With about 160 companies, the Boehringer Ingelheim corporation is represented on every continent. With its own research, production and distribution facilities it ranks among the 20 major pharmaceutical companies worldwide.

<H2>NEW TREATMENT FOR PROSTATE CANCER UNDER DEVELOPMENT



</H2>



</CENTER>



Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) and British Technology Group (BTG) have signed an agreement granting BI an option to an exclusive licence to develop and market the new compound, CB7630, for treating androgen-dependent disease.



<P>



CB7630 is mainly aimed at treating hormone-dependent prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is a common disease in the western countries with approximately 180,000 new cases each year. Because the incidence of prostate cancer increases with old age, effective treatment becomes a greater priority as the proportion of elderly in the population grows.



<P>



In 75 - 80 % of cases, tumours of the prostate respond to hormonal therapy. Current clinical interest has focused on the concept of total blockade of the effects of both testicular and adrenal androgen production using an anti-androgen and LHRH agonist in combination. Early research suggests that CB7630 will cause rapid and profound suppression of serum testosterone levels and it is hoped that it will provide a convenient, single orally active drug for use as an alternative to combination therapy.



<P>



CB7630 was discovered at the CRC Centre for Cancer Therapeutics at the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR), Sutton, UK. BTG funded much of the early development work and has filed patent applications in major territories worldwide. The Cancer  Research Campaign plans to conduct a Phase I clinical trial of CB7630 at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London. If BI exercises its option, BI will take full responsibility for subsequent development.



<P>



BTG will receive payments from BI linked to development milestones and a royalty based on sales. These revenues will be shared with the ICR and CRC under BTG's normal terms of business.



<P>



Dr Peter Bailey, Head of Biosciences at BTG said "CB7630 is an important addition to BTG's portfolio of cancer drugs in development by major pharmaceutical companies worldwide. There is a clear need for improved treatment of prostate cancer. We are delighted to have reached agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim to take CB7630 forward."



<P>



Prof. Rolf Krebs, Member of the Board of Managing Directors of Boehringer Ingelheim pointed out that Boehringer Ingelheim's interest in CB7630 was clearly in line with its strategic R&D focus of getting involved with innovative concepts in therapeutic areas with a high unmet medical need.



<P>



Professor Gordon McVie, Director CRC Scientific Department said: "The Cancer Research Campaign has a major programme on the development of new anti-cancer drugs and has established, at the Institute of Cancer Research, the CRC centre for cancer therapeutics, which is the largest multi-disciplinary unit for anti-cancer drug development in the UK. ICR, in conjunction with the Royal Marsden NHS Trust constitutes a world-class centre of excellence for cancer research."



<P>



BTG's business is the profitable commercialisation of technology. With nearly 50 years' experience of patenting and licensing technology to industry worldwide, BTG has considerable expertise in the protection, development and marketing of intellectual property. BTG holds around 10,000 patents and patent applications covering some 1400 inventions with approximately 500 licence agreements. It operates on an international basis with offices in the UK, USA, Japan and India.



<P>



Boehringer Ingelheim is an international corporation with headquarters in Ingelheim, Germany, operating in the fields of pharmaceutical, biological, and chemical products. With about 160 companies, the Boehringer Ingelheim corporation is represented on every continent. With its own research, production and distribution facilities it ranks among the 20 major pharmaceutical companies worldwide.

<H2>ROXANE LABORATORIES, INC. BEGINS MAJOR EXPANSION</H2>



</CENTER>











Roxane Laboratories, Inc. today announced plans to begin a major expansion of its facility located at 1809 Wilson Road. This announcement comes as a result of a 1995 announcement by Boehringer Ingelheim in the U.S. to consolidate its human pharmaceuticals manufacturing into two locations for the North American business - Columbus, OH and Mexico City.



<P>



Built in 1986, the Wilson Road site is a 300,000-square-foot office, laboratory, manufacturing and distribution  complex situated on 72 acres. The expansion will include a new distribution facility, additional quality control and analytical laboratories, enlarged areas for manufacturing and packaging as well as administration. The project is scheduled for completion in early 1998 and will represent an investment of more than US$ 100 million.



<P>



The expansion will provide additional employment opportunities for residents of the Columbus community as well as business opportunities for service related industries in the area.



<P>



"Our expansion plans are a tangible commitment to Columbus, with its vibrant business community and attractive  lifestyle for our employees and their families," said Gerald C. Wojta, President and COO, Roxane Laboratories, Inc. "We're delighted to grow with this diverse and exciting city."



<P>



State and local government officials were also excited by the announcement and the impact it will have on the economy in Columbus.



<P>



"With this expansion, Roxane Laboratories has chosen to further its local history by continuing to call Columbus 'home'  - Roxane Labs has been an integral part of the growth of our economic development  'landscape' for over 30 years. This decision accentuates Columbus as having one of the most vibrant economies in the nation and underscores our city's presence as a world-class competitor when it comes to retaining a leading technology and research company such as Roxane Laboratories," Mayor Greg Lashutka said.



<P>



"Roxane Laboratories' investment of over $100 million and the creation of a significant number of jobs over the long term is a tremendous economic boost to the Columbus area and the State of Ohio," said Lieutenant Governor Nancy P. Hollister.



<P>



Jonathan York, President of the Greater Columbus Chamber of Commerce, commented "The Chamber was excited to have the opportunity to work with Roxane Laboratories and their international executives to ensure expansion took place in Columbus. We are delighted they have chosen to make such a substantial commitment to the city."



<P>



Roxane Laboratories, Inc. is a leading manufacturer of ethical human pharmaceuticals with a special interest in products for pain management and palliative care of patients with cancer and HIV infection. The company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Boehringer Ingelheim Corporation, located in Ridgefield, CT, and part of the Boehringer Ingelheim worldwide group of companies, based in Ingelheim, Germany.

<H2>25 years of Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals 



US subsidiary of the German company on the road to success



</H2>



</CENTER>



Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., one of the subsidiaries of the Boehringer Ingelheim Corporation in the United States, will have been operating in 1996 on one of the biggest health markets in the world for a quarter of a century. 



<P>



Founded in 1971 in White Plains in the US state of New York as Boehringer Ingel-heim Limited/USA (Bilusa), the company has been signing under the name of Boehringer Ingel-heim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. since 1984. The activities of the company with its seat in Ridge-field (Connecticut) focus on the research, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. In business year 1995, the company, with 1,800 employees, achieved sales of DM 1,177 million after DM 1,074 million the previous year despite the difficult market conditions. Growth is considerably higher when viewed in US dollars, well above the general development on the pharmaceutical market. 



<P>



The range of innovative products, the most striking of which was Atrovent* for the treatment of chronic obstructive bronchitis, was responsible for the success of Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals in the year under review. This product line is to be supplemented this year with a nasal spray for allergic and non-allergic rhinitis. There are plans to launch Combivent* for the treatment of airways diseases at the end of 1996 / early 1997. Both products are expected to contribute substantially to a further improvement in sales. 



<P>



In spite of the reforms to the US healthcare system which are as yet difficult to foresee, the company is optimistic about its chances of contributing to the future growth of the US healthcare market with innovative products. On the whole, the economic area of North America, which includes the USA, Canada and Mexico, has proved over the past few years to be the economic area showing the most dynamic potential for the Boehringer Ingelheim pharma business. 



<P>



The press conference to present the Boehringer Ingelheim annual report, including a report of the size and structure of the Corporation's US business, is to be held in Frankfurt on 14 May 1996.

<H2>INTROGENE B.V. OBTAINS RIGHTS TO 



BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM'S DNA TRANSFECTION TECHNOLOGY















</H2>



</CENTER>



IntroGene B.V., the Netherlands-based gene therapy company announced today that it has obtained exclusive rights to the proprietary DNA transfection technology of Boehringer Ingelheim for the manufacture of Adeno Associated Virus (AAV) vectors.



<P>



Using Boehringer Ingelheim's transfection technology, a specific gene can be transferred across the cell membrane. The target gene is coated with transferrin, which then binds to receptors on the cell surface. This causes the cell membrane to surround the gene/transferrin complex and draw it into the cell as a discrete, membrane-bound package. Then, an added, inactivated virus breaks down the package releasing the gene. The gene then migrates into the nucleus and combines with the normal DNA of the cell.



<P>



IntroGene's AAV vectors have been shown to be highly efficient in transferring genes into cells, both in-vivo and ex-vivo, and by combining IntroGene's AAV vector technology with the gene transferrin technology of Boehringer Ingelheim it is anticipated that production can be scaled up so that commercial quantities of AAV vectors can be manufactured. In addition, using these two technologies ensures that the AAV vectors produced can be manufactured consistently and will satisfy international good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards. It is anticipated that this combination of technologies will successfully bypass the severe bottleneck faced by the industry, namely that AAV vectors can only be manufactured on a laboratory scale.


<P>



Under the terms of the agreement, IntroGene will carry out feasibility studies on the manufacture of AAV vectors by this method and will undertake phase I clinical trials of therapeutic products. Boehringer Ingelheim will give technical assistance and contribute to this research programme.



<P>



On successful completion of phase I trials, IntroGene will offer an exclusive licence to Boehringer Ingelheim for the commercialisation of the therapeutic product, arising specifically from this collaborative research, in return for royalty payments on all sales of that product.



<P>



This agreement extends IntroGene's leading position in the development of viral delivery systems, for therapeutic genes.



<P>



Prof. Dinko Valerio, Chief Executive Officer of IntroGene commented: "I am very pleased to be able to announce this agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim, which has one of the most active in-house gene therapy programmes of any multinational pharmaceutical company. Boehringer Ingelheim's non-viral delivery technology is a powerful addition to the "vector tool-box" which IntroGene is developing for the production of a wide range of gene therapy products. We anticipate that the Boehringer Ingelheim technology will allow us to manufacture commercial quantities of our AAV vectors which can be used as therapeutic gene products in many areas of high unmet clinical need."



<P>



Prof. Peter Swetly, Corporate Director Research and Development of Boehringer Ingelheim Vienna commented: "We have been enormously impressed by the quality of IntroGene's research and its ability to establish itself as one of the forefront companies in gene therapy. The combination of our own proprietary technology with IntroGene's offers exciting possibilities and we hope that this is just the first phase of a long and successful partnership."



<P>



Boehringer Ingelheim is an international corporation with headquarters in Ingelheim, Germany, operating in the fields of pharmaceutical, biological, and chemical products. With about 160 companies, the Boehringer Ingelheim corporation is represented on every continent.

<H2>BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM: ALLIANCE WITH TOP US CANCER RESEARCH INSTITUTES















</H2>



</CENTER>



The New York Branch of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (LICR), the Sloan-Kettering Institute (SKI), part of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center based in New York, USA, and Boehringer Ingelheim with headquarters in Ingelheim, Germany, announced today the signing of a collaborative research alliance aimed at identifying tumor stromal antigens and developing new therapeutics against cancer based on those findings.



<P>



LICR, SKI and Boehringer Ingelheim will study the biology of solid cancers, looking for insights into the role played by normal stromal cells, such as activated fibroblasts and blood vessels, in helping the cancerous cells secure their own supply of oxygen and nutrients, and to enable them to invade normal tissues and metastasize to distant organs. LICR researchers will focus on the identification of novel proteins expressed on the tumor stromal cells, primarily with the help of monoclonal antibodies. Boehringer Ingelheim will focus on biochemical and genetic studies to elucidate the molecular function of these proteins in cancer progression. Based on their findings, Boehringer Ingelheim, LICR, and SKI expect to discover novel control points in the biochemistry of cancer that will lead to the development of innovative therapeutics and diagnostics for the disease and related conditions.



<P>



In addition, Boehringer Ingelheim gains exclusive rights to develop and commercialize an antibody product targeting FAP, one of the specific tumor stromal antigens identified by LICR and SKI scientists. The antibody has demonstrated favourable biodistribution characteristics in preliminary clinical testing at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.



<P>



"We are very pleased to collaborate with Boehringer Ingelheim, a company that offers both outstanding capabilities in drug discovery and development, and broad access to pharmaceutical markets world-wide," said Dr Lloyd J. Old, Chief Executive Officer of the Ludwig Institute "Boehringer Ingelheim's strong discovery momentum in oncology as well as their interest in developing innovative, next-generation treatments, makes them an ideal partner for this project."



<P>



Prof. Rolf Krebs, Member of the Board of Managing Directors of Boehringer Ingelheim and responsible for the Corporate Board Division Pharma pointed out that the cooperation with the Ludwig Institute and the Sloan-Kettering Institute represents an important part of Boehringer Ingelheim's new discovery efforts in oncology. The targeting of tumor stromal antigens may lead to a specific treatment modality for solid tumors, such as breast, lung and colon cancers, that may spare normal tissues. Since this therapeutic approach should be broadly applicable to many different types of solid tumors, it has the potential for a breakthrough cancer medication.



<P>



Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research is a Swiss, not-for-profit corporation engaged in scientific and clinical research in the field of cancer. The research of the Ludwig Institute is conducted at branches, of which there are ten, located in seven different countries throughout the world.



<P>



In 1945, Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., and Charles F. Kettering, joined forces to establish the Sloan-Kettering Institute (SKI). Their research experience at General Motors led them to believe that similar research techniques could be implemented at Sloan-Kettering Institute to conquer cancer. 



<P>



Sloan-Kettering Institute has basic research programs in many areas of biology, genetics, biochemistry, immunology, and therapeutics. SKI's mission is to explore any and every avenue of research that offers promise of contributing to the solution of the cancer problem.







Boehringer Ingelheim is an international corporation with headquarters in Ingelheim, Germany, operating in the fields of pharmaceutical, biological and chemical products. With about 160 companies, the Boehringer Ingelheim corporation is represented on every continent. With its own research, production and distribution facilities it ranks among the 20 major pharmaceutical companies world-wide.

<H2>BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM: 33 MILLION DM FOR 



NEW RESEARCH BUILDINGS IN BIBERACH







</H2>



</CENTER>



The Boehringer Ingelheim is building  a new complex for pharmacology and pharmacokinetics investing 33 million DM in its subsidiary Dr. Karl Thomae in Biberach/Riss. The construction of the new building with a usable floor space of over 6000 square meters was officially started by Dr. Bernd Wetzel, Head of Research and Development in Germany on 18 December 1995.



<P>



The construction of these new premises which will cover six floors and are specially designed for the requirements of pharmacological and pharmacokinetic research, represents the first step in the concentration of the German pharmaceutical research and development activities (R+D) in Biberach. Within the framework of this project Biberach will be developed step by step as the center of Boehringer Ingelheim's research and development in Germany. Biberach will thus be one of the main R+D sites in the international Boehringer Ingelheim Corporation, which is investing for the first time over one billion in research and development worldwide. The main fields of research in Germany are diseases of the cardiovascular system, the respiratory tract, the central nervous system and tumour diseases.

Boehringer Ingelheim, a pharmaceutical company with headquarters in Ingelheim, Germany, and the Stockholm-based Fermenta AB, a holding company of Fermenta Animal Health in Kansas City, Missouri, have concluded the due-diligence process and have reached an agreement on the transfer of Fermenta Animal Health to Boehringer Ingelheim. The transfer was concluded on December 5, 1995.



<P>



Fermenta Animal Health in Kansas City, Missouri, and Elwood, Kansas, has at present 220 employees and is strong in antibacterials and therapeutic specialities with sales of more than US$ 57 million in 1994.



<P>



"Fermenta Animal Health has found in this transfer a long-term committed owner", said Fermenta's President and CEO, Kent Jinghall. "Boehringer Ingelheim will continue with the full-product portfolio of Fermenta Animal Health improving customer value for cattle, swine, and other animal species", said Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health Managing Director Dietrich Janott. "This acquisition reflects our Animal Health strategy and our commitment to expand our veterinary business not only organically but also by acquisitions. It will strengthen our market position in the US with combined sales of about US$ 100 million per year in this important market," said Dr Claus D. Rohleder, Member of the Board of Managing Directors at Boehringer Ingelheim, responsible for Industrial and Special Products.



<P>



The production facility in Elwood, Kansas, will serve as a resource of supply for pharmaceutical, parasiticide, and medicated feed products and investments are planned for further improvements to supply world-wide markets.



<P>



The terms of the agreement also include the businesses for Fermenta Animal Health in Canada and Belgium. Financial terms of the transfer will not be published.



<P>



Boehringer Ingelheim's animal health business operates world-wide and focuses on the development, production, marketing, and distribution of therapeutic specialities, antibiotics, and vaccines. With about 160 companies and an annual turnover of more than 6 billion deutschmarks in the field of human pharmaceuticals, industrial and special products, Boehringer Ingelheim is represented on every continent.

<H2>BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM SPENDS 18 MILLION DEUTSCHMARKS ON 



NEW AMPOULE FACTORY IN JAPAN 







</H2>



</CENTER>



In a ceremony attended by representatives of the Japanese government and officials, Boehringer Ingelheim opened a new ampoule factory at its subsidiary 



San-a Pharmaceuticals in Toride, about an hour's drive away from Tokyo. The company has invested 18 million deutschmarks in the new factory. After production of the first test batches at the beginning of 1996, it will become fully operational in April 1996.



<P>



Up to the end of 1996, only ampoules of the painkiller Buscopan will be produced at this state-of-the-art production facility. Then, from 1997 onwards, production will be stepped up to a total of 36 million ampoules per year and will also include the respiratory product Bisolvon.



<P>



Furthermore, the new factory has been designed in such a way that an additional line can be added later, allowing Japan's annual requirements for the two medications, some 45 million ampoules in all, to be met in full.



<P>



A newly developed system for the sterilisation of ampoules by microwave is the pivot of the new production technology in Toride. In this new system, the filled ampoules are heated by microwave in a single operation and thus sterilised. Until now, they have had to be taken out of the production process and heated and sterilised in a separate autoclave. Eisai's new microwave sterilisation system, first installed at Boehringer Ingelheim's subsidiary San-a Pharmaceuticals, greatly reduces throughput times, allowing each ampoule to be sterilised and checked under the same conditions. Abandoning use of autoclaves also helps streamline and cut the costs of production. The Toride factory is considered to be one of the most advanced ampoule production facilities in the world.

<H2>ISIS AND BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM SIGN DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT



TO FORM CELL ADHESION COLLABORATION;



ISIS RECEIVES $28.5 MILLION EQUITY INVESTMENT







</H2>



</CENTER>



Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISIP), Carlsbad, CA and Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany announced they have signed the definitive agreement and completed formation of a major collaboration in cell adhesion drug design, discovery, development and commercialization. On March 1, 1995, the companies announced they had signed a Letter of Intent to combine Boehringer Ingelheim's programs in cell adhesion with Isis' cell adhesion program. With the closing of the transaction, Boehringer Ingelheim and Isis have successfully structured a unique, combined program, based on the respective strengths of each partner, with the potential to lead the industry in creating novel cell adhesion-targeted drugs directed against inflammatory diseases.



<P>



Consistent with the terms of the agreement outlined in the letter of intent, Boehringer Ingelheim has made an equity investment in Isis of $28.5 million at a price of $15 per share.

<H2>SEQUANA THERAPEUTICS AND BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM 



FORM ASTHMA RESEARCH ALLIANCE







</H2>



</CENTER>



Sequana Therapeutics, Inc., based in La Jolla, California and Boehringer Ingelheim with headquarters in Ingelheim, Germany announced today the signing of a collaborative research alliance aimed at identifying genetic causes of asthma and developing new therapeutics based on those findings. The new corporate alliance builds on a collaboration established last year between Sequana and the Samuel Lunenfield Research Institute (SLRI) of Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) in Toronto, Canada to isolate, clone and sequence genes associated with asthma. 



<P>



In connection with the signing of the agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim, Sequana will receive an equity investment of $6 million. During the research phase of the alliance, Sequana will receive license fees, research funding and milestone payments which may total up to $ 32.5 million. In addition, Sequana will receive development milestone payments of up to $32 million upon the achievement of specific events. Boehringer Ingelheim will also pay to Sequana royalties on the sale of therapeutic products. In accordance with the agreement between Sequana and MSH, Sequana is obligated to share with MSH and other Toronto institutions the license fees, milestone payments and royalties received from Boehringer Ingelheim.



<P>



Sequana, SLRI and Boehringer Ingelheim will study the genetics of asthma, looking for insights into the molecular defects underlying the disease. Sequana researchers will focus on gene identification, while Boehringer Ingelheim focuses on gene expression and biology. Based on their findings, the companies expect to identify novel control points in the biochemistry of asthma that will lead to the development of innovative therapeutics and diagnostics for the disease and related conditions.



<P>



Under the terms of the agreement, Boehringer Ingelheim gains exclusive rights to develop and commercialize therapeutic products based on genes discovered through the collaboration, while Sequana retains the rights to develop and commercialize diagnostic products. 



<P>



"We are very pleased to collaborate with Boehringer Ingelheim, a company who offers both outstanding capabilities in drug discovery and development, and broad access to pharmaceutical markets worldwide," said Audrey D. Keane, Vice President of business development at Sequana. "Boehringer Ingelheim's strong existing focus in asthma and other respiratory diseases, as well as their interest in developing innovative, next-generation treatments, makes them an ideal partner for this project."



<P>



Professor Rolf Krebs, Member of the Board of Managing Directors of Boehringer Ingelheim and responsible for the Division Pharma pointed out that the cooperation with Sequana is focused on future-oriented research to find ways to prevent the development of inflammatory processes in the airways, and that this approach fits well with the research and development efforts of Boehringer Ingelheim in the field of respiratory diseases.



<P>



The research collaboration begun by Sequana and SLRI in September 1994 employs blood samples and clinical data acquired by the Canadian researchers from the 300 closely related inhabitants of Tristan da Cunha, an island in the South Atlantic belonging to the United Kingdom. These individuals exhibit one of the highest incidences of asthma in the world. Additional patient samples have been collected by SLRI and other Sequana collaborators throughout the world.



<P>



Sequana was founded to discover and characterize genes that cause or predispose individuals to common diseases. Sequana has developed a proprietary gene discovery technology which is based on positional cloning, a method that uses statistical analysis of disease inheritance patterns to isolate disease genes. The Company expects that identification of disease genes will provide insight into the causes of common diseases and facilitate the development of highly specific diagnostic and therapeutic products.



<P>



Established in 1985, The Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute of Mount Sinai Hospital, affiliated with the University of Toronto, is widely recognized as one of Canada's premier biomedical research facilities, with a research staff of over 380. The Institute has recently announced the establishment of a new Centre for Human Genome Research and Molecular Medicine focusing on polygenic diseases.



<P>



Boehringer Ingelheim is an international corporation with headquarters in Ingelheim, Germany, operating in the fields of pharmaceutical, biological, and chemical products. With about 160 companies, the Boehringer Ingelheim corporation is represented on every continent. With its own research, production and distribution facilities it ranks among the 20 major pharmaceutical companies worldwide.

<H2>ISIS AND BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM 



FORM A MAJOR COLLABORATION IN CELL ADHESION 



</H2>



</CENTER>



Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ISIP) and Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH announced today the signing of a letter of intent to form a collaboration in the area of cell adhesion. The collaboration will combine Boehringer Ingelheim's on-going programs and intellectual property in cell adhesion with Isis' cell adhesion program and its expertise in antisense and small molecule combinatorial drug discovery. The combined program will lead the industry in the design, development and commercialization of cell adhesion-targeted drugs to treat a wide variety of inflammatory diseases. The transaction is structured in a novel manner that creates an equal collaboration based on the respective strengths of each company.



<P>



The aggregate value of the collaboration to Isis is potentially in excess of $100 million. The major terms of the letter of intent are as follows:



<UL>



<LI>The collaboration shall combine the clinical and research programs of both companies in the field of cell adhesion 



<P>



<LI>Boehringer Ingelheim will make an equity investment in Isis of $28.5 million at a premium to current market value 



<P>



<LI>Boehringer Ingelheim and Isis will provide ongoing funding for the combined research and development program (except for the Boehringer Ingelheim compound BIRR1 which will continue to be funded by Boehringer Ingelheim)



<P>



<LI>Upon commercialization, Isis will receive a royalty with respect to worldwide sales of BIRR1 and will share equally in the operating profits associated with all future products of the collaboration 



<P>



<LI>In support of the combined programs, Boehringer Ingelheim will make additional equity investments upon meeting certain milestones and also provide a $40 million line of credit to Isis.



</UL>















This collaboration is subject to negotiation of a definitive agreement and is expected to close in the second quarter of 1995.



<P>



According to Prof. Rolf Krebs, Vice Chairman of the Boehringer Ingelheim Board of Managing Directors who is responsible for the Pharmaceuticals division, "Boehringer Ingelheim is seeking to develop innovative approaches to the treatment of various diseases. Our efforts are focused on securing the best technology for selected areas of in-house expertise. Cell adhesion is a very important target for Boehringer Ingelheim. We have extensively evaluated potential partners for our effort and are very pleased to be consummating this relationship with Isis. By allying ourselves with the creative and aggressive team at Isis, we expect to combine the elements of large and small company capabilities and use our combined resources in cell adhesion biology to create novel drugs to treat a wide variety of inflammatory diseases. By structuring the collaboration as an equal partnership we believe its value and productivity will be maximized for the benefit of both companies."



<P>



Dr. Stanley T. Crooke, Chairman and CEO of Isis commented, "Isis is pleased to form a collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, a leading international pharmaceutical company that shares our commitment to innovation and to cell adhesion. Boehringer Ingelheim has established a recognized leadership position in cell adhesion biology and therapeutics and was our first choice for a partner to create a world-class anti-inflammatory program. Boehringer Ingelheim will be a highly valuable partner for Isis in the development and commercialization of ISIS 2302 and future products arising from the collaboration. And, their financial support will greatly enhance Isis' ability to invest in our core antisense and combinatorial drug discovery technologies and support our shared goal of developing a product pipeline centered around key molecular targets involved in inflammatory disease."



<P>



Isis and Boehringer Ingelheim have highly synergistic and well-developed programs targeting multiple cell adhesion molecules implicated in inflammatory diseases. Isis is the leading company in the field of antisense drug discovery and has a strong effort in small molecule combinatorial drug discovery. Boehringer Ingelheim has a significant drug discovery effort in both monoclonal antibodies and small molecule drug discovery targeting cell adhesion molecules. The combined technology assets of the two companies form a cell adhesion capability that will set a very high standard in the industry.



<P>



The letter of intent provides that the collaboration will be structured such that both parties will share equally the commercial benefit derived from all development candidates that will be part of the joint effort including ISIS 2302, which is currently in Phase I clinical trials. ISIS 2302 is an antisense drug designed to inhibit Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1). ISIS will continue to lead the development of ISIS 2302.



<P>



In addition, Isis will receive a royalty from Boehringer Ingelheim's murine monoclonal antibody-based drug (BIRR1), which is currently in pivotal Phase III trials for the prevention of renal transplant rejection and stroke and Phase II trials for treatment of burns.



<P>



















Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) make up a large family of related proteins that are involved in a variety of cell-to-cell interactions and are potential targets for treating inflammatory disease. CAMs play a major role in the movement of white blood cells or leukocytes through the wall of the blood vessel as they make their way toward sights of inflammation. Excess-migration of white blood cells into tissue, however, can cause tissue damage and chronic inflammation. Over-expression of ICAM-1 is specifically implicated in a wide variety of inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, psoriasis, organ transplant rejection and inflammatory bowel disease. Inhibitors of endothelial cell leukocyte adhesion molecules may prevent the migration of immune cells from the vasculature into tissue and therefore modify the disease process with a more acceptable toxicity profile than currently available anti-inflammatory therapies.



<P>



Boehringer Ingelheim was represented in this  transaction by Vector Securities International, Inc. According to James Foght, Ph.D., President, Vector Securities International, Inc., "We feel that this collaboration between Boehringer Ingelheim and Isis may represent a new model for alliances between pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Boehringer Ingelheim and Isis have structured a collaboration which combines several technologies over multiple product generations into a single combined program. At the same time, this transaction recognizes the need of the larger partner to provide capital support while preserving a significant economic opportunity for the smaller partner."



<P>



Boehringer Ingelheim is an international corporation with headquarters in Ingelheim, Germany operating in the fields of pharmaceutical, biological and chemical products. With about 160 companies, the Boehringer Ingelheim corporation is represented on every continent. With its own research, production, and distribution facilities it ranks among the 20 major pharmaceutical companies worldwide.

<H2>25 Mio Dollar-Investition / Grundsteinlegung fr neuen Pharmabetrieb in Shanghai
</H2>
<h3>Joint Venture zwischen Boehringer Ingelheim und SPC geht zgig voran</h3>

</CENTER>
In dem vor den Toren Shanghais gelegenen Industriebezirk Pudong hat jetzt die Grundsteinlegung fr eine neue von dem Joint Venture zwischen Boehringer Ingelheim und seinem chinesischen Partner Sine Pharmaceuticals Corporation Limited (SPC), Shanghai, betriebene Pharmafabrik stattgefunden. An der Grundsteinlegung nahmen neben prominenten Vertretern chinesischer Behrden der Sprecher der Unternehmensleitung von Boehringer Ingelheim, Dr. Heribert Johann sowie Dr.Hans-Jrgen Leuchs, Leiter des Unternehmensbereichs Technologie und Pharma-Herstellung des Ingelheimer Unternehmens, teil.
<P>
Mit der Grundsteinlegung fr die neue Pharma-Produktionssttte mit einem veranschlagten Investitionsvolumen von 25 Millionen Dollar haben die deutsch-chinesischen Partner das im Februar dieses Jahres unter der Firmenbezeichnung Shanghai Boehringer Ingelheim Sine Pharmaceuticals Corp. Ltd. (SBISPL) gegrndete Joint Venture zgig vorangebracht. Den Vereinbarungen gem wird die Investitionsumme zu 60 Prozent von Boehringer Ingelheim bernommen, whrend die verbleibenden 40 Prozent von SPC getragen werden. Der neue Pharmabetrieb, in dessen Anlagen eine breite Palette von Arzneimittelformen wie Ampullen, Lsungen, Tabletten und Kapseln hergestellt werden, soll planmig 1998 die Produktion aufnehmen.
<P>
Der Unternehmensverband Boehringer Ingelheim erwartet aus dem Joint Venture in Shanghai, in das die 1924 gegrndete SPC eine profunde Kenntnis des schnell wachsenden Pharmamarktes der Volksrepublik China einbringt, auch Impulse fr das gesamte Pharmageschft in der Wirtschaftsregion Asien.

<H2> Boehringer Ingelheim: Forschungskooperation mit Isis auf gutem Wege
Weitere Beteiligungsinvestition von 10 Millionen Dollar</H2>
</CENTER>
Das Pharmaunternehmen Boehringer Ingelheim, das seit 1995 mit der Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in Carlsbad/Kalifornien auf dem Gebiet der Zelladhsion zusammenarbeitet, hat die Beziehungen zu seinem US-amerikanischen Partner mit einer zustzlichen Beteiligungsinvestition in Hhe von 10 Millionen Dollar weiter vertieft. Im Juli des vergangenen Jahres hatte das Ingelheimer Unternehmen bereits fr 28,5 Millionen Dollar Anteile der brsennotierten Isis erworben.
<P>
Zelladhsionsmolekle, die einen Schwerpunkt der Zusammenarbeit der beiden Unternehmen bilden, gehren zu einer groen Familie verwandter Proteine. Sie sind an zahlreichen Wechselwirkungen zwischen Zellen beteiligt und stellen potentielle Angriffspunkte fr die Behandlung von entzndlichen Krankheiten dar.
<P>
Eine Schlsselsubstanz der laufenden Kooperation zwischen Boehringer Ingelheim und Isis ist der Wirkstoff Isis 2302. Die Ergebnisse der ersten klinischen Prfung der Phase IIa mit dieser Substanz bei der Behandlung von Morbus Crohn, eine der schwersten und am schwierigsten zu behandelnden entzndlichen Magen-Darm-Erkrankungen, veranlaten beide Unternehmen, eine breit angelegte Basisstudie der Phase IIb fr das erste Quartal 1997 anzusetzen.
<P>
Die gut vorangekommene Forschungszusammenarbeit zwischen Boehringer Ingelheim und Isis ist Teil einer vom deutschen Unternehmensverband in den letzten Jahren eingeleiteten Kooperationsstrategie mit aufstrebenden Biotechnologie-Firmen, die zu innovativen Arzneimitteln fr die Behandlung verschiedener Krankheiten fhren soll.

<H2> Europisches Forum bei Boehringer Ingelheim gegrndet
Grenzberschreitendes Gremium aus Vertretern der 
Arbeitnehmer und Arbeitgeber</H2>
</CENTER>
Fr die europischen Standorte des Unternehmensverbandes Boehringer Ingelheim wurde unter der Bezeichnung "Boehringer Ingelheim European Forum" ein grenzberschreitendes Gremium aus 23 Arbeitnehmervertretern und acht Vertretern der Arbeitgeberseite gegrndet, in dem berregionale Themen, die fr die Arbeitnehmer von besonderem Interesse sind, behandelt werden sollen.
<P>
In dem nach einer freiwilligen Vereinbarung geschaffenen Forum werden 13.000 Mitarbeiter aus 14 Lndern (Belgien, Dnemark, Deutschland, Frankreich, Griechenland, Grobritannien, Irland, Italien, Niederlanden, Norwegen, sterreich, Portugal, Schweden und Spanien) vertreten.
<P>
Das Forum, zu dessen Sitzungen regelmig auch Mitglieder der Unternehmensleitung und des zentralen Managements eingeladen werden, soll die Plattform fr einen verstrkten konstruktiven Dialog auf europischer Ebene sein. Dabei werden folgende Themen im Vordergrund stehen: Wirtschaftliche und finanzielle Lage des Unternehmensverbandes; Trends bezglich der Beschftigungssituation; Fortbildung und Personalentwicklung; Gesundheit, Sicherheit und hnliche Fragen; organisatorische und strukturelle Vernderungen, insbesondere in Produktion, Forschung und Entwicklung.
<P>
Nach dem Vertrag, den das Unternehmen und die Mitarbeitervertretungen auf der Grundlage der europischen "Richtlinie ber die Einsetzung eines europischen Betriebsrates oder die Schaffung eines Verfahrens zur Unterrichtung und Anhrung der Arbeitnehmer" geschlossen haben, wird der Vorsitz des Forums immer mit einem Vertreter der Arbeitnehmer besetzt. Ulrich Zllner, Vorsitzender des Betriebsrates der Boehringer Ingelheim KG, wurde am 25. November 1996 von den Arbeitnehmervertretern zum Vorsitzenden gewhlt; stellvertretender Vorsitzender ist Klaus Stochl, Bereichsleiter Personal der Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, der Zentrale des Unternehmensverbandes. Der stellvertretende Vorsitzende erwartet, "da das European Forum wesentlich dazu beitragen wird, da es zu konstruktiven Diskussionen ber Themen kommt, die mehr als ein Land betreffen, und da unsere Mitarbeiter damit auch einen besseren Einblick in Prozesse der Entscheidungsfindung bekommen. Der verstrkte Dialog auf europischer Ebene entspricht unserem ausdrcklichen Bekenntnis zur offenen Kommunikation, die ein grundlegender Bestandteil unserer Vision und Fhrungsphilosophie ist."

<H2>Boehringer Ingelheim: Weiterer Ausbau des Tiergesundheitsgeschfts
39 Millionen Dollar-Investition in den USA
</H2>
</CENTER>Das Pharmaunternehmen Boehringer Ingelheim investiert im Rahmen des kontinuierlichen Ausbaus seines Tiergesundheitsgeschfts rund 39MillionenDollar fr die Errichtung einer neuen Impfstoff-Produktionsanlage in St. Joseph (Missouri, USA). Die neue Anlage in dem Schwerpunktstandort fr Tiermedizin des Unternehmensverbandes soll planmig im Frhjahr 1998 in Betrieb genommen werden, womit St. Joseph zu einem der grten Produktionssttten fr Tiergesundheitsprodukte auf dem nordamerikanischen Markt heranwchst.
<P>
Mit der Investition in St. Joseph signalisiert Boehringer Ingelheim, da das Unternehmen im Markt der Tiergesundheit eine gewichtige Rolle spielen will. Mit seinem Geschftsgebiet Tiergesundheit, das sich auf die strategischen Zielsegmente therapeutische Spezialitten, Antibiotika und Impfstoffe konzentriert, wurden im Geschftsjahr 1995 Gesamterlse von 250 Millionen DM erwirtschaftet. Fr 1996 werden Gesamterlse von 370 Millionen DM erwartet. 
<P>
Das Geschftsgebiet Tiergesundheit von Boehringer Ingelheim beschftigt weltweit insgesamt rund 1.000 Mitarbeiter, davon knapp ber 130 in Deutschland. Die wichtigsten Mrkte sind neben Europa vor allem Nordamerika und Fernost. Einen nachhaltigen Schritt zur Ausweitung des Tiergesundheitsgeschfts, insbesondere auf dem US-Markt, hatte der Unternehmensverband mit der im Oktober 1995 bernommenen Fermenta Animal Health vollzogen.

<H2>Boehringer Ingelheim steigerte Gesamterlse im 1. Halbjahr 1996 um 6,8 Prozent auf 3,4 Milliarden DM 



</H2>



</CENTER>



Das Pharma- und Chemieunternehmen Boehringer Ingelheim konnte seine weltweiten Er-lse im ersten Halbjahr 1996 im Vergleich zum entsprechenden Vorjahreszeitraum um 6,8 Prozent oder 209 Millionen DM auf 3.430 Millionen DM aus-weiten.



<P>



Nach Angaben von Dr. Heribert Johann, dem Sprecher der Unternehmensleitung, resultierte der Zuwachs hauptschlich aus Mengenwachstum und Neueinfhrungen von insgesamt 5,2 Prozent. Unternehmensakquisitionen brachten einen Erlszuwachs von 1,5 Prozent, whrend Whrungsfluktuationen mit 0,4 Prozent eine geringe positive Auswirkung hatten und der Verkauf von Unternehmen die Erlse um 0,3 Prozent minderte.



<P>



Wie weiter mitgeteilt wurde, stiegen die Erlse mit verschreibungspflichtigen Prpara-ten im Berichtszeitraum um 6 Prozent auf 2.865 Millionen DM, die damit fr 85 Pro-zent der Ge-samterlse verantwortlich zeichneten. Das Tiergesundheitsgeschft konnte seine Erlse um 53 Prozent auf 176 Millionen DM steigern, wobei die bernahme der Fermenta Animal Health in den USA im Oktober 1995 den strksten Ausschlag gab. Im Back- und Nah-rungsmittelgeschft blieben die Erlse mit 169 Millionen DM auf dem Stand von 1995. Die Erlse bei Chemikalien gingen um 8 Prozent auf 215 Millionen DM zurck, nachdem in der Berichtsperiode zwei Vertriebsvertrge in den Vereinigten Staaten beendet wurden. 



<P>



Fr Forschung und Entwicklung hat der Unternehmensverband in den ersten sechs Monaten dieses Jahres 578 Millionen DM aufgewendet, nach 501 Millionen DM im ersten Halbjahr 1995.



<P>

Der Personalaufwand belief sich insgesamt auf unverndert 31,6 Prozent der Gesamter-lse; die Personalkosten stiegen im Vergleich zum ersten Halbjahr 1995 um 7 Prozent, ohne Einbeziehung der Fermenta um 6 Prozent.



<P>



Nach Einschtzung von Dr. Heribert Johann knnten die Erlse im laufenden Jahr auf ins-gesamt 7 Milliarden DM steigen. Voraussetzung dafr sei allerdings, da die Wechselkurse stabil bleiben. Aufgrund steigender Forschungs- und Entwicklungsaufwendungen und zahl-reicher Marketingaktivitten fr Neueinfhrungen werde es schwieriger werden, den Ergeb-nistrend des Vorjahres fortzusetzen. Auf der Basis der jngsten Zahlen bestehe jedoch die berechtigte Hoffnung, da Boehringer Ingelheim das Niveau der letzten beiden Jahre nach-vollziehen kann.



<P>



Im Geschftsjahr 1995 hatte der Unternehmensverband das bisher beste finanzielle Ergeb-nis mit Nettoerlsen von 6,4 Milliarden DM und einem berschu nach Steuern von 273 Mil-lionen DM erzielt.

<H2>Boehringer Ingelheim: 40 Jahre in Finnland</H2>

</CENTER>

Die Beziehungen des Pharma- und Chemieunternehmens Boehringer Ingelheim zu Finnland sind gut entwickelt: Das Unternehmen ist im Oktober dieses Jahres immerhin bereits seit 40 Jahren auf dem finnischen Markt ttig; dies allerdings nicht mit einer eigenen Landesgesellschaft, die Pharma-Geschfte des Ingelheimer Unternehmens werden vielmehr von der zum grten finnischen Pharmakonzern OrionOy, Espoo/Helsinki, gehrenden Panfarma wahrgenommen. In der Panfarma hat das mit der Orion Pharma GmbH, Hamburg, auch in Deutschland vertretene finnische Pharmaunternehmen seine fr auslndische Pharmahersteller in Finnland - auer Boehringer Ingelheim sind dies Luitpold-Pharma, Parke-Davis und ALK (Dnemark) - betriebenen Aktivitten gebndelt. 

<P>

Nach eher bescheidenen Erlsen vor vier Jahrzehnten konnte Boehringer Ingelheim auf dem finnischen Markt im Geschftsjahr 1995 Pharmaerlse in der Grenordnung von 18,3 Millionen DM erwirtschaften. Die bekanntesten Prparate aus Ingelheimer Produktion in Finnland sind Arzneimittel zur Behandlung von Atemwegs- sowie Herz- und Kreislauferkrankungen wie Atrovent, Bisolvon, Silomat, Catapresan und Persantin. Im Bereich der Prparate zur Auflsung von Blutgerinnseln wie etwa beim aktuen Herzinfarkt hat Boehringer Ingelheim mit dem gentechnisch gewonnenen und biotechnisch hergestellten Medikament Actilyse einen berproportional guten Marktanteil in Finnland.

<P>

Nach amtlichen Angaben ist der Handel zwischen Finnland und Deutschland 1995 auf den neuen Rekordwert von insgesamt 13,3 Milliarden DM gestiegen. Whrend die deutschen Ausfuhren nach Finnland um 23 Prozent auf 6,6 Milliarden DM zunahmen, gingen die deutschen Einfuhren aus Finnland um 5 Prozent auf 6,7 Milliarden DM zurck.

<H2>Boehringer Ingelheim erhht Beteiligung bei



Cambridge NeuroScience



</H2>



</CENTER>



Das Pharma- und Chemieunternehmen Boehringer Ingelheim hat mit der Cambridge NeuroScience (CNSI), Cambridge (Massachusetts/USA) den Erwerb von 1.237.624 Stammaktien im Wert von 10 Millionen Dollar zum Preis von 8.08 Dollar pro Aktie vereinbart. Mit der Transaktion, die in den nchsten Wochen abgeschlossen sein drfte, wird sich der Beteiligungsanteil des deutschen Unternehmens an CNSI auf rund 17 Prozent erhhen, nachdem Boehringer Ingelheim bereits im vergangenen Jahr 1.250.000 CNSI-Aktien - zum Preis von 8 Dollar je Stck - erworben hatte.



<P>



Das im Januar bzw. Mrz 1995 unterzeichnete Kooperationsabkommen von Boehringer Ingelheim und CNSI beinhaltet die weltweite Entwicklung und Vermark-tung des von dem US-Unternehmen erforschten Arzneimittels Cerestat* zur Be-handlung von Schlaganfllen und traumatischen Hirnverletzungen. Eine erste magebende Studie mit rund 900 Schlaganfall-Patienten war im vergangenen Monat eingeleitet worden. Im Mrz dieses Jahres hatte bereits eine Studie begonnen, bei der die Wirkungsmechanismen von Cerestat* bei traumatischen Hirnverletzungen im Vordergrund stehen.



<P>



Das Medikament verhindert das Absterben von Nervenzellen sowie Hirnschdigung nach Kopfverletzungen oder Schlagan-fall, indem es einen bermigen Kalziumeintritt in die Nervenzellen verhindert. Er-fahrungsgem kommt es nach einer schweren Kopfverletzung oder einem Schlag-anfall durch bermige Glutamat-Freisetzung aus den beschdigten Nervenenden und dem dadurch ausgelsten massiven Einstrom von Kalzium in die Nervenzellen zum Tod dieser Zellen. 



<P>



Nach jngsten Schtzungen erleiden allein in den Vereinigten Staaten pro Jahr 500 000 Menschen einen Schlaganfall, weitere 400 000 traumatische Hirnverletzun-gen. Bislang gibt es kein wirksames Arzneimittel, um diese Flle zu behandeln.

<H2>Boehringer Ingelheim: Zehn Jahre "rzte-Betriebswirtschaft"



Wirtschaftliche Praxisfhrung vermittelt</H2>



</CENTER>



Die von dem zum Unternehmensverband Boehringer Ingelheim gehrenden Pharmaunternehmen Dr. Karl Thomae GmbH, Biberach/Riss, in Kooperation mit dem rzte-Apotheker-Wirtschaftsinstitut (Bonn) herausgegebene Zeitschrift "rzte-Betriebswirtschaft" gibt es jetzt seit zehn Jahren.



<P>



Vor dem Hintergrund der sich bereits 1986 abzeichnenden schwieriger werdenden wirtschaftlichen Situation der Arztpraxen gegrndet, war eines der Hauptziele der Zeitschrift, dem niedergelassenen Arzt angesichts wachsender wirtschaftlicher Zwnge und Erfordernisse bei der Fhrung seiner Praxis Hilfestellung anzubieten. Dieser Anspruch stand auch im Mittelpunkt des Themenangebots in den Jahren 1990 und 1991, als insgesamt 15 Ausgaben von "rzte-Betriebswirtschaft" speziell fr rzte in den neuen Bundeslndern herausgebracht wurden.



<P>



Seit ihrer Grndung sind insgesamt 97 Ausgaben der Zeitschrift erschienen; bei durchgngig 24 Seiten pro Heft entspricht dies 2.328 Seiten mit einem breit angelegten Themenspektrum, in dem aber Fragen der wirtschaftlichen Praxisfhrung einen eindeutigen Schwerpunkt bilden. Diese redaktionelle Ausrichtung will der Herausgeber von "rzte-Betriebswirtschaft", deren Auflage bei 28.000 liegt, auch in Zukunft beibehalten.



<P>



Fortbildung zum Thema Betriebswirtschaft in der rztlichen Praxis steht auch im Mittelpunkt des  - begleitend zu der Zeitschrift "rzte-Betriebswirtschaft" - initiierten "Thomae-Wirtschaftsforums", das ebenfalls seit zehn Jahren besteht. Neben betriebswirtschaftlicher Grund- und Fortbildung beschftigen sich die Programme des Wirtschaftsforums auch mit Aspekten, die den Arzt in seiner Funktion als Arbeitgeber berhren. Stark in den Vordergrund gerckt sind darber hinaus Existenzsicherungsthemen.



<P>



Die Bilanz nach zehn Jahren kann sich sehen lassen: Insgesamt etwa 60.000 Teilnehmer zhlten die rund 2.000 Seminare des Thomae-Wirtschaftsforums. Der Bedarf an Seminaren mit betriebswirtschaftlichem Hintergrund, mit Managementthemen und rechtlichen Fragen ist weiterhin gro. Das Themenangebot wird sich knftig auf zwei Themen pro Jahr konzentrieren.
