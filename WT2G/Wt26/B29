Reporters consider most risky products newsworthy, but tobacco gets far more coverage than any other risky 
product, including such illegal drugs as cocaine and marijuana. This is one conclusion of a special year-long, 
two-part study of news coverage of risky products. The study, conducted by the Media Research Center's Free
Market Project, analyzes network morning and evening news shows between August 1, 1995 and July 31, 1996. 
The study found:
<UL>
<LI> <B>Tobacco as a risk problem is overemphasized.</B></a><BR> Tobacco and smoking were the subject of 413 news stories, compared to 136 stories for obesity/fatty foods, 94 for auto safety, and 58 for alcohol. Tobacco even drew more coverage than cocaine, heroin, LSD, and marijuana combined, which were the subjects of 340 stories.
<P>
<LI><B> The media have allowed the Clinton Administration to use tobacco as a political weapon.</B> </a><BR>President Clinton was the driving force behind a good deal of the tobacco news. Eighty-five stories focused on his efforts to regulate tobacco. Only 45 of the stories about illegal drugs mentioned Clinton, and almost all of these references were positive.
<P>
<LI><B>There is a double standard in coverage of tobacco as a political issue. </B></a><BR>Jack Kemp's flip-flops on affirmative action and immigration were noted in five evening news stories during the 1996 Republican Convention. Al Gore's tobacco flip-flop -- politically exploiting his sister's smoking-related death after having boasted in 1988 about his tobacco farming history -- didn't receive any evening news coverage during the Democratic Convention.
<P>
<LI><B> Anti-tobacco sources far exceed pro-tobacco sources in terms of both quality and quantity.</B></a><BR> Reporters ran soundbites from 270 anti-tobacco/pro-regulation sources, compared to 116 from pro-tobacco/anti-regulation sources. They also gave anti-tobacco/pro-regulation sources the last word in 132 stories, compared to only 40 for the other side.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Recommendations:</H3>
<I>Reporters should be skeptical of both the tobacco industry and anti-smoking activists. Currently, they are 
skeptical of only one side -- the tobacco industry. And they should ask themselves: Is tobacco really more 
important and newsworthy than illegal drugs? </I>

Consumers face risks when they choose to buy and consume certain products. But the news media do not treat all of those risks the same. Tobacco, especially, receives far more total coverage with a far more negative tone than does every other risky product.
This is the finding of a special year-long Media Research Center study of news coverage of risky products and the industries which make and sell them. For the study, Media Research Center analysts reviewed all of the stories about several risky products on the morning and evening news shows on ABC, CBS, and NBC, as well as CNN's World News and World Today shows between August 1, 1995 and July 31, 1996. Tobacco and the tobacco industry received more negative coverage by far than any other risky legal product or its maker, such as dietary fat and the food industry, automobiles and the auto industry, alcohol and the alcohol industry, and pesticides and the chemical industry. Tobacco even received more coverage than illegal drugs. This media obsession with tobacco affected coverage of other issues as well, even coverage of the 1996 presidential campaign.

<P>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
Which is worse, a legal product that if used over many decades can be life-threatening, or an illegal product that can be of more immediate danger?
<P>
For America's news media, the answer is overwhelmingly the former. Over the twelve-month study period television news has devoted significantly more air time to reporting on tobacco than to reporting on cocaine, heroin, LSD, and marijuana combined.
<P>
There were 413 stories during the twelve-month study period about tobacco; there were 340 stories about illegal drugs. This disparity was present despite well-documented rapid increases in the use of illegal drugs over the past few years, notably among teenagers. It should be noted, too, that many of the stories about illegal drugs were brief anchor-reads about, for instance, the status of football star Michael Irvin's drug trial, not rising drug use.
<P>
Among the print media, the disparity has been even greater. A Nexis search of headlines in American newspapers found that the terms "tobacco or smoking or cigarette" were employed 9,067 times between during the study period. Over the same time period, however, the terms "cocaine or heroin or LSD or marijuana or illegal drugs" were used only 3,875 times. In other words, there were more than twice as many stories focusing on tobacco than there were stories focusing on illegal drugs.

<H4> Politics, Tobacco, and Illegal Drugs</H4>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
President Clinton has helped put the tobacco story on the map. Eighty-five of the television news tobacco stories were about the Clinton Administration's attacks on the tobacco industry. Almost all of these stories were upbeat about Clinton's attempts to regulate the industry, portraying him as courageously taking on a powerful industry. NBC's Bryant Gumbel, for instance, announced on the August 11, 1995 Today that "in a historic move the Clinton Administration has declared nicotine to be a drug and has proposed regulations aimed at curbing smoking by teenagers." According to CBS' John Roberts, on the August 10, 1995 This Morning, "President Clinton is stepping up federal efforts to harness smoking among teenagers. He'll detail some tough new measures today that are sure to put him at odds with the powerful tobacco lobby."
<P>
But when the issue was the increased use of illegal drugs, Clinton Administration officials were only mentioned in 45 stories, and most of these references were positive. Again, the disparity is revealing. The same reporters who are willing to accept Clinton's premise that government policies can discourage smoking behavior among the young demand little accountability from him for increased illegal drug use. And there was rarely even the suggestion in the media that the president was playing up the tobacco issue to hide how much illegal drug use had increased during his watch.
<P>
Among the print media, the same disparity was present. A Nexis search reveals that there were 1,819 stories between August 1, 1995 and July 31, 1996 that had "tobacco or smoking or cigarette" in the headline and a reference to Bill Clinton in the body of the story. Stories with the terms "cocaine or heroin or LSD or marijuana or illegal drugs" in the headline and a reference to Clinton in the body of the story numbered only 204.
<P>
This media's obvious distaste for tobacco continued after the study period and affected campaign coverage as the 1996 presidential contest heated up. Normally, when a politician radically changes positions on an issue, it's big news. For instance, there were five network evening news stories during the 1996 Republican National Convention about Jack Kemp altering his positions on illegal immigration and affirmative action once he became the Republican vice-presidential candidate. 
<P>
"The quarterback became the acrobat today," reported ABC's Jackie Judd on the August 14, 1996 World News Tonight. "Kemp was flip-flopping on long held positions." She noted that these changes "left at least one delegate here feeling abandoned" and that "Kemp's change in position on these core issues fights the very image that he's built for himself as an independent thinker." According to Dan Rather, on that same night's CBS Evening News, "Bob Dole has reversed himself on deficit reduction versus tax cuts. Jack Kemp has reversed himself on how he feels about immigration." Rather wondered: "Isn't that, or is it, going to make it more difficult to attack Bill Clinton on the character issue?"
<P>
But these bloodhounds sniffing out hypocrisy turned quiet when Vice President Al Gore radically changed his position on tobacco. In his speech to the Democratic National Convention, Gore said that his sister's death from lung cancer in 1984 prompted his anti-tobacco crusade. None of the networks pointed out that in 1988, he boasted to tobacco growers that "throughout most of my life, I raised tobacco. I want you to know that with my own hands, all of my life, I put it in the plant beds and transferred it. I've hoed it. I've dug it in. I've sprayed it, I've chopped it, I've shredded it, spiked it, put it in the barn and stripped it and sold it." There were no stories on the evening news shows during the convention about Gore's change of heart. The same reporters who derided Kemp for changing positions on immigration and affirmative action didn't find Gore's flip-flop on tobacco at all newsworthy.
<P>
<a name="fat">
<P>
<BR>
 <H4> Tobacco and Fat</H4>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
There was an even greater disparity between the number of stories on tobacco and the number on other legal products. On television -- during the same time period in which there were 413 stories about tobacco -- there were 136 stories about dietary fat and obesity; 94 stories focused on auto safety; only 58 stories were related to alcohol and health.
<P>
The disparity between reporting on tobacco and reporting on dietary fat and obesity is especially curious. The same health advocates who tell us that tobacco contributes to 400,000 deaths in the U.S. each year also report that obesity contributes to 300,000 deaths in the U.S. per year. It would stand to reason, then, that there would be about three-fourths the number of stories on fat and obesity as there were about tobacco. There weren't.
<P>
Reporters acknowledged the riskiness of obesity and dietary fat. "Obesity, of course, is a major health problem in this country," NBC's Tom Brokaw reported on the April 29, 1996 Nightly News. "It is estimated that it's responsible for 300,000 deaths a year from heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and the like." CBS' Jacqueline Adams reported that "for years doctors have known that during pregnancy, obesity can cause serious problems like diabetes and bleeding for the mother. But according to two new studies in tomorrow's Journal of the American Medical Association, obesity in the mother can also cause serious problems for the fetus," including birth defects.
<P>
One reporter, ABC's John McKenzie, insisted that even one high-fat meal, if eaten at an inopportune moment, can be dangerous. McKenzie told viewers about a University of Marylyand study  in which researchers "found that after a high-fat meal, arteries, when required to handle an increased flow of blood, could expand on average only 50 percent of normal. It means that under conditions of stress and exertion, people who already have constricted arteries may not get enough blood to the heart."
<P>
While reporters acknowledged this riskiness, they didn't give the risk of obesity and dietary fat nearly the same amount of coverage they gave to tobacco. There were only about one-fourth the number of stories about obesity and fat as there were stories about tobacco, even though obesity contributes to three-fourths as many deaths each year as tobacco.
<P>
<a name="complain">
<P>
<BR>
<H4>Complaints Against Tobacco</H4>
<P>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
There was also a different standard of judgment for the industries that make and sell other risky products. They were never subjected to nearly the same hostility that the tobacco industry endured. There were no stories, for example, about fast-food advertising enticing kids and others to consume products that may one day kill them. Nor were there any stories pointing out the medical costs of obesity. And no network reporter sought to outline the campaign contributions of companies which produce and sell alcohol. But the networks were all critical of tobacco advertising and campaign contributions, as well as the medical costs to society of smoking-related illnesses.
<P>
In stories about advertising, the assumption was clear: Cunning tobacco advertising entices unwitting youngsters into lifelong addiction to tobacco. ABC's Nancy Snyderman, for instance, reported "that 12-18 year-olds are in fact most influenced by [tobacco] advertising...and obviously we know that the earlier you smoke, the more addicted you are, the harder it is to break. So I think it's one more indication that advertising works."
<P>
But there are those both inside and outside the tobacco and advertising industries who question how effective -- and how constitutional -- proposed regulations on tobacco advertising could be. "How will banning tobacco ads possibly discourage smoking?" asked columnist James K. Glassman in the August 27, 1996 Washington Post. "LSD use rose 183 percent between 1992 and 1995, and I haven't seen any LSD ads recently." Such arguments were rarely heard on television news.
<P>
Another big tobacco story: The political donations of the industry and how those donations allegedly affected politicians' attitudes and actions toward tobacco. Reason magazine senior editor Jacob Sullum, writing in the July 29 National Review, asserted that in such reports, the assumption usually is "that tobacco companies had given Dole and the Republican Party a lot of money, so he was clearly in league with the devil." According to Sullum, such reports assume the industry buys votes and never consider "the possibility that politicians...might get tobacco money because they support certain policies, rather than the other way around."
<P>
Sullum is right. Linda Douglass, for example, on the June 27, 1996 CBS Evening News, told viewers that "Dole now is in the uncomfortable position of often siding with the tobacco industry just as cigarette makers are pumping unprecedented sums of money into the Republican Party." On the same night, NBC's Bob Kur, after quoting the Clinton campaign's charge that Dole was toeing the tobacco industry line, pointed out, with a large on-screen graphic, that the industry "gave nearly $3 million in political contributions last year, 85 percent of the money to Republicans." Industry -- especially tobacco industry -- contributions were all reporters cared about. The political contributions of trial lawyers or unions sparked little media interest.
<P>
Second-hand smoke was the focus of twelve stories. Reporters were much more likely to cover studies showing that second-hand smoke leads to health problems in non-smokers than they were to cover studies which questioned such data. Example: A November 14, 1995 Congressional Research Service study, while not declaring passive smoke to be safe, questioned some of the numbers put forward by second-hand smoke critics. The number of stories on the CRS study -- zero.
<P>
Reporters often mistook experts on health and medicine for experts on public policy. Bob Kur, on the April 9, 1996 Today, introduced viewers to a doctor who studied the effects of second-hand smoke on children. Kur didn't show any skepticism toward the doctor when he recommended that "smoking be banned wherever children are present and even suggests smoking be considered in child custody cases and foster home placements. With tobacco under increasing assault, [Dr.] DiFranza also believes a study like his could prompt a class-action lawsuit on behalf of children." Kur didn't allow other views into his story, such as the view that separating children from their smoking parents is a bit extreme or the view that much tobacco litigation is frivolous.
<P>
Journalists seem to have lost some perspective when reporting on tobacco. They not only air far more stories on tobacco than on other legal risky products, but they have allowed the Clinton administration to use smoking to deflect public attention from rising illegal drug use. Responsible reporters should not ignore tobacco, but they should not apply to it a standard which is harsher even than the standard they apply to illegal drugs.

<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
One subtle, but powerful, form of bias in the media has to do with selection and placement of soundbites from sources. The most obvious display of source bias is when reporters interview or use sources only from one side of an issue. Sometimes, however, a story is biased even when reporters have conscientiously produced soundbites from both sides. One side may consistently get the last word in a story, thereby giving it an edge. Or reporters may interview sources from one side that will be credible in the eyes of viewers and less credible sources from the other. In the case of tobacco reporting during the year-long study period, every one of these biases was present.
<P>
<BR>

<P>
<a name="number">
<P>
<BR>
<H4>Number of Soundbites</H4>
<P>
<p>[ <a href="#content">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
 In stories about tobacco regulation, tobacco advertising, tobacco lawsuits, campaign contributions from tobacco companies, and second-hand smoke, there were more than twice as many soundbites from those opposed to the tobacco industry than from those either supporting tobacco or opposing government regulation. In such stories, there were 270 soundbites from anti-tobacco/pro-regulation sources. There were only 116 soundbites from pro-tobacco/anti-regulation sources. In many stories, only anti-tobacco/pro-regulation sources were presented.
<P>
Example: The introductory story for the May 23, 1996 CBS Evening News. The story was about a class-action lawsuit against the tobacco industry that had just been thrown out of court and a new study which indicated that smoking had increased among young blacks. Correspondent Jim Stewart's story included a soundbite about the lawsuit from John Banzhaf, an anti-smoking activist, who said: "I think this is a significant setback for the victims, but it is not a reprieve for the tobacco industry. We'll simply bring the cases in state court rather than federal court." He also interviewed Rep. John Lewis about tobacco sales to black teens. "I think there has been a deliberate, systematic effort on the part of the tobacco industry to target black teenagers." Stewart noted that many blamed advertising for the increase in smoking. He didn't make room in his story for comments from those who think tobacco lawsuits are frivolous, or from those who think advertising doesn't explain teen smoking behavior.
<a name="word">
<P>
<BR>
<H4> Getting the Last Word</H4>
<P>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
The last soundbite in a story is often the most important. The exeprt who is quoted last often gets the chance to refute the best argument presented from the other side. In the stories about tobacco, anti-tobacco/pro-regulation sources were given the opportunity to speak last more than three times as often pro-tobacco or anti-regulation sources. In 132 stories, most of which were about either lawsuits or proposed regulations, anti-tobacco/pro-regulation sources were given the last word. In 40 stories, pro-tobacco/anti-regulation sources were given the last word.
<P>
In one typical story, CBS's Bill Plante first ran a soundbite from Bill Clinton arguing that further regulation of tobacco is necessary because "cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are harmful, highly addictive, and aggressively marketed to our young people." He then ran a soundbite from "tobacco-state lawmaker" Wendell Ford, who said: "The administration has chosen litigation over compromise." Plante's next soundbite was from Clinton arguing that voluntary measures won't work: "First of all, there'd be no way to enforce it. Secondly, the history of voluntary agreements with the tobacco industry is not good, to put it mildly." Steve Parrish of Philip Morris, then told viewers: "Make no mistake, the real issue and the real agenda here is prohibition." Plante's final soundbite was from FDA Commissioner David Kessler, who said the issue was solely about children: "If you don't start smoking by 18 or 19, you don't start smoking."
<P>
In each case, Plante let soundbites from Clinton Administration sources counter whatever arguments anti-regulation spokesmen brought up, without giving the anti-regulation side the same courtesy.
<a name="credible">
<P>
<BR>
<H4> Credibility of Sources</H4>
<P>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
In the stories about tobacco, television news reporters almost always went to anti-smoking sources that would likely be more credible in the eyes of viewers than the sources interviewed on the pro-tobacco/anti-regulation side. An August 3, 1995 CNN World News story about President Clinton's attempts to regulate the industry is an example. Correspondent Wolf Blitzer first ran a soundbite from President Clinton, who asserted that the best way to improve the health and health care of Americans is to stop teen smoking.
<P>
Then Blitzer ran a soundbite from George Dessart of the American Cancer Society. "Trusting the tobacco industry to set and enforce the same limits voluntarily," argued Dessart, "flies in the face of the industry's record, of its best interests, and of its motives." Blitzer then allowed the Tobacco Institute's Walker Merryman a chance to respond: "If the Food & Drug Administration gets involved in tobacco regulation there can be only one result, and that's a ban on the product." Finally, Blitzer ran a soundbite from North Carolina Representative Charlie Rose, who asked, "Why not take the word of the cigarette companies that they will join in a government partnership to keep tobacco products away from kids?"
<P>
Is this balance? Blitzer interviewed two sources from each side of the regulatory debate, and he even gave an anti-regulation congressman the last word. But both of those featured on the anti-regulation side of the debate had a personal interest in opposing regulations. This, of course, didn't make what they had to say wrong, but it certainly would taint their opinions in the eyes of viewers, unlike the source affiliated with the American Cancer Society. Blitzer should have also interviewed an expert, perhaps from a university psychology or marketing department, who would have questioned the efficacy of regulations on advertising.
<P>
In some cases reporters cannot be expected to find credible sources on both sides. For example, balance does not require reporters to find and interview scientists who claim that smoking is not risky behavior. But on such issues as tobacco regulation, tobacco advertising, tobacco lawsuits, campaign contributions by the tobacco industry, and second-hand smoke, there is a real debate with independent experts arguing, for instance, against the regulation of tobacco and against lawsuits aimed at the tobacco industry.
<P>
Usually the only people opposing tobacco regulations who were interviewed were those with a vested interest in stopping regulations, such as tobacco-industry spokesmen or tobacco-state politicians. Such sources should be interviewed. But they are not the only ones who oppose increased regulation. Other disinterested experts should be interviewed as well. Reporters who don't interview credible experts on both sides of such issues are not giving their viewers the entire story.

<BODY bgcolor="#ffffff" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<center><img src="/mrc/images/checkbox.gif" <br>
<p></center>
In every recent presidential election the media have tilted their coverage toward the liberal nominee. One poll by the  <!--a href="/may96pg1.html"-->Freedom Forum found 89 percent of Washington reporters voted for Bill Clinton in '92. 
<p>
We fully expect the media to again portray Congressional Republicans as out-of-touch extremists and the Democratic incumbents as mainstream moderates. 
<p>
The Democrats will portray themselves as the last defense against a takeover of the presidency and Congress by far-right extremists out to destroy 
the environment, starve the poor, and throw the elderly on the
 streets.
  The media will let them get away with this by failing to highlight Clinton's liberal policies. 
<p>
To neutralize this bias, the MRC launched a $2.8 million effort to expose liberal media bias during the 1996 election campaign. Read <a href="/mrc/reality/pcspeech.html">Chairman L. Brent Bozell's</a> speech.
<p>
<a href="/mrc/reality/realchek.html">Media Reality Check '96</a> will counter the media's liberal spin through our comprehensive media database of network news stories, our newsletters 
<a href="/mrc/mediawatch/welcome.html"><b>MediaWatch</b></a>, 
<a href="/mrc/nq/welcome.html"><b>Notable Quotables</b></a>, and 
<a href="/mrc/medianomics/welcome.html"><b>MediaNomics</b></a>, and our new book 
<a href="/mrc/bookstore/welcome.html"><b>Pattern of Deception</b></a>
, proving the media's pro-Clinton bias. 
<p>
In addition, several new projects are now or will soon be available on-line:
<p><ul>
<li>Two-page Media Reality Check '96 updates will be periodically 
sent via <a href="/mrc/reality/pressrel.html"><b>Fax Reports</b></a>
 to a list of over 1,500 media, political, public policy and grassroots contacts around the country, documenting examples of biased coverage and detailing study results proving bias.
<p>
<li>A daily <a href="/mrc/cyberalert/conv96.html"><b> Media Reality Check</b></a> newsletter to be distributed to delegates, talk show hosts, and reporters at the Republican Convention in San Diego and the Democratic Convention in Chicago. Through e-mail, faxes and on-site delivery in San Diego, we'll get our evidence distributed to talk show hosts, columnists, editorial writers, and reporters across the country.
 <p>
<li><a href="/mrc/cyberalert/welcome.html"><b>CyberAlerts</b></a> on campaign bias: Several times a week we'll deliver e-mail alerts on the latest biased quotes and trends to reporters, talk show hosts, columnists, and conservative activists. To sign up for CyberAlerts, send your e-mail address to <a href="mailto:mrc@mediaresearch.org">mrc@mediaresearch.org</a>.
<p>
<li><b>Press releases</b> will announce study findings, provide our reaction to bias as it occurs, and give warning shots to reporters before major events, telling them how to avoid biased coverage. 
<p>
<li><b>Convention Guide to the Media</b> will be distributed at the conventions to show through past quotes which reporters have been naughty or nice. 
<p>
<li><b>MRC Merchandise</b>: Bumper stickers, pens and magnets boldly displaying our message "I Don't Believe the Liberal News Media!" will be distributed to delegates at the national conventions and to the public.

<center><h1>The Media's Coverage of Election Night '96</h1></center>
<P>
<P>
<I><B>November 6, 1996:  MRC analysts are working furiously to get you the latest liberal bias spouted by the media on election night and during the post-election coverage.  MRC <a href="/mrc/cyberalert/">CyberAlerts</a>, studies, and reports will soon be released. Until then, here's the tip of the iceberg of the Election Night '96 coverage:</I></B><P>
<P>
<P>

NBC <I>Today</I>'s Matt Lauer to RNC Chairman Haley Barbour, 11/6/96:<BR>  
"Mr. Barbour, exit polls show us that the economy was still the number one issue on people's mind last night.  And although character and trust play a role, people choose candidates based on their handling of the issues.  With that in mind, what do you say to people now who look to Republicans in Congress and say, hey, move forward on key legislation. Don't get bogged down on investigations into the Clinton White House?"<BR>
<P>

CBS<I> This Morning</I>'s Troy Roberts, 11/6/96: <BR> 
"The pundits had written his political obituary, but last night Newt Gingrich oversaw a victory, just barely, as voters ratified the two-year-old revolution that changed the face of Congress.  The party retains control of the House, despite discouraging poll figures about its leader..."<BR>
<P>

ABC's David Brinkley talking to Sam Donaldson, Cokie Roberts, Jeff Greenfield, Lynn Sherr, Hal Bruno and Peter Jennings during the final minutes of <I>The '96 Vote</I>, 11/6/96: <BR>
"OK, fine, I'm not going to say much.  Among things I admire, almost near the top is creativeness, and everyone in this group has it.  It shows in your work, it shows in your thinking, and it shows in your speech, what you do, what you write, what you say, and it's one reason this group is so terrific.  Bill Clinton has none of it, he has not a creative bone in his body.  Therefore, he's a bore and will always be a bore."<BR>
<P>
<P>
More coverage coming soon!  <BR>

<TITLE>Bozell Press Conference</TITLE>

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h1> Statement of L. Brent Bozell III <BR>
Chairman, Media Research Center </h1></center>
<center><h3> <a href="http://www.conservative.org">ACU Press Conference</a><BR>
November 6, 1996</h3></center>
<P>
<P>
	In 1990 a group of conservative leaders - some present today - publicly predicted George Bush would lose his campaign for re-election because his administration had abandoned the mission of the Reagan revolution.  As the '92 campaign unfolded , and the lackluster, issue-less Bush campaign limped through the summer and fall, it became evident our prediction would be correct.<BR>
<P>

	Bob Dole had two diametrically opposite strategies to choose from this year.  Follow in the footsteps of Ronald Reagan with a conservative agenda outlining not just a vision of, but a specific agenda for, a limited government, a strong national defense and a commitment to family values - a strategy that led to two landslide elections; or follow in the footsteps of Bush, with  no vision,  and virtually no message.  It was stunning to see Dole for months reject the Reagan message, and adopt the Bush non-agenda.  And when, in the final days, he decided to move to the right, Dole, like Bush in '92, closed the gap.  But like Bush in '92, it was too little too late. <BR>
<P>

	Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.  Santayana would have made for a good political pundit this year. <BR>
<P>

	But there was another similarity.  In both campaigns, the GOP nominee made the same terrible miscalculation, assuming the national media, particularly the networks, would report on the elections in a fair and balanced manner. <BR>
<P>

	In 1992, Bill Clinton presented himself to America as a "New Democrat" and embraced a strongly conservative agenda in his campaign.  It was a farce, and those who knew this man's record said so.  The media, however, were silently, refusing to expose the charade - and no one was surprised when Clinton immediately launched a left-wing agenda in 1993, abandoning promise after campaign promise.  Also in 1992, reporters, contrary to the conventional mythology perpetrated by so many in the press, barely touched numerous Clinton scandals; some, like Whitewater, were ignored completely by the networks throughout the entirety of the campaign. <BR>
<P>

	Remarkably, Clinton pulled it off again this year.  After his Big Government agenda was so decisively rejected after two years, Clinton announced the era of Big Government was dead - and then took responsibility for it.  What followed in this campaign was dishonesty after dishonestly, twisting the facts, distorting the truth, even claiming on national television to stand in favor of issue after issue that he had, in fact, actively opposed!  But what made this situation even worse, the so-called Truth Squads in the media, again particularly on the networks, simply took a pass, and refused to expose the dishonesty. <BR>
<P>
 

	But where the coverage of ethical scandals was concerned, the record this year from the networks was simply abominable.  At this moment the Media Research Center is analyzing every single network news story in the past four years to determine how many Clinton scandals, or major developments within them, were completely ignored by the networks, either on their evening news or their morning news programs.  Having seen the initial data, I can tell you that when this report is released in a couple of weeks, the American public will be absolutely shocked at the sheer number of scandals covered up by the networks. <BR>
<P>

	The next few months will tell the story.  If in that period Clinton delivers on his campaign promises - tax cuts, a balanced budget, reduced federal government, a strong national defense, a ban on partial birth abortions,  support for the institution of marriage, school choice; and if the literally dozens of scandals swirling around this administration in general, and the Clintons in particular, all prove to be groundless as this administration contends, then there really is a Tooth Fairy.  But if Clinton returns to his left-wing agenda while the indictments begin to fly, no one standing here will be shocked; and the American public is going to demand to know why the networks did not report what they knew was going to happen.  I will be one of those demanding an answer. <BR>
<P>

<h2>MEDIA REALITY CHECK BLAST</h2>


Whitewater: The Story Reporters Loved to Hate
<p>

ALEXANDRIA, VA. &#173;&#173; In a study of nearly three months of network and news magazine coverage, the Media Research Center found that despite the suggestion that
the national media's only bias is in favor of &quot;a good story,&quot; the Whitewater story &#173;&#173; indictments, convictions, Senate hearings, and all &#173;&#173; is still the story reporters love to hate. The lack of coverage is matched by the disparaging tone members of the media have displayed toward Whitewater over the past few months. A representative sampling of these follows on page two.
<p>

First, among the study findings:<p>

From February 29 to May 20, the four TV evening news shows aired only 23 reporter&#173;based stories on Whitewater in more than 11 weeks. Only 13 reports came from the Big Three, compared to ten stories on CNN's The World Today.
Eleven of the 23 stories focused on the President's testimony.
<p>
The most stunning lack of coverage came from NBC Nightly News, which aired only one reporter&#173;based story in the entire 11 weeks &#173;&#173; on May 9.
<p>
The three network morning shows aired only 14 reporter&#173;based stories and five interviews in 11 weeks. Again, much of the coverage (nine of the 14 stories and
two of the five interviews) concerned Clinton's testimony.
<p>
None of the magazine shows covered the trial &#173;&#173; but then, from 1992 forward, all of the magazine shows combined have aired only two reporter&#173;based stories
on Whitewater. 
<p>
Although Time carried a long cover story excerpting James Stewart's Whitewater book Blood Sport, the news magazines devoted fewer pages to the Whitewater trial than they
did to the Jackie Onassis auction. In their May 6 editions, Time made the auction their cover story and gave it eight pages, Newsweek devoted six pages, U.S. News, two.

<p>
Some significant stories the networks barely or never covered: 

<p>
On February 29 and again on March 7, Senate Democrats blocked votes extending the tenure of the Senate Whitewater Committee. The Democrats held up further hearings until agreeing to a deal on April 18. One reporter&#173;based story on ABC's World News Tonight (and anchor briefs on ABC's Good Morning America and CNN) were the only coverage of the Democratic filibuster until the hearings resumed April 24.
<p>
On March 15, a federal appeals court removed Judge Henry Woods from a related case against Gov. Jim Guy Tucker and reinstated four fraud counts struck down by Woods,
finding the judge was too close to the Clintons. Despite several network stories and an entire Nightline on the credibility of independent counsel Kenneth Starr, the networks never covered the Woods story.                        
<p>
On March 24, an ABC News/Washington Post poll announced 52 percent of respondents believed the First Lady was not telling the truth about Whitewater and 49 percent said
they believe she acted illegally. While the Post published the poll, buried on page A16, ABC never reported it. 

<p>
When word leaked on April 29 that the FBI found Hillary Clinton's fingerprints on the long&#173;missing Rose Law Firm documents discovered in the White House, it drew
only four anchor&#173;read briefs.Second, there's a good reason why Whitewater has received so little coverage: Many reporters don't think it's worth covering or that it's been over covered.
<p>
Check out these recent quotes:
<p>
On Friday's Washington Week in Review (May 24) on PBS they discussed the RNC ad attacking Clinton for invoking the Soldier and Sailors' Act, prompting New York Times
columnist Tom Friedman to note the ad was created &quot;Right when Whitewater seems to be grinding to a halt as a legal issue.&quot; A few minutes later, moderator Ken Bode (also a CNN analyst), offered his view of why Republicans decided to run the ad: &quot;Whitewater is sort of diminishing, sort of fading away, it's kind of a shadowy
thing now, it's going away.&quot; 
<p>
Steve Roberts of U.S. News &amp; World Report, on C&#173;SPAN's Washington Journal, May 16: &quot;This kind of call which says, 'You're all liberals,' haven't been listening, they haven't been reading. Anybody, anybody, it seems to me, who
gives a fair reading, Brian [Lamb], of the press coverage of Bill Clinton's first three years, cannot say that the press has been easy on Bill Clinton. The press has beaten the hell out of Bill Clinton over and over again, and Whitewater, which that caller mentions, is just one example and day after day coverage of that issue, which is legitimate and should be there.&quot;

<p>
Time columnist Margaret Carlson and U.S. News &amp; World Report Editor&#173;in&#173;Chief Mort Zuckerman on CNBC's Cal Thomas show, March 24, 1996: 
<p>
Carlson: &quot;It's [Whitewater] out there, it's been out there, it's not going to have any more impact than it's already having.&quot; 
<p>
Zuckerman: &quot;I don't think there's anything there unless Kenneth Starr does come up with anything, and the fact that there is a trial going on I think is not going to be relevant to what the elections going to be all about, you can't run an election based on attacking the President's wife.&quot;

<p>
Eleanor Clift of Newsweek on The McLaughlin Group, February 10, 1996: &quot;If Ken Starr is a credible prosecutor he will bring this to a conclusion and the Clintons will be exonerated.&quot;

<p>
Margaret Carlson, Time magazine columnist and former White House reporter, on CNN's Capital Gang, December 23, 1995: &quot;As the curtains keep getting lifted there's nothing there! There's no big, you know, there's no big smoking gun. There's no magilla! And they keep going and not finding anything.&quot;

<a name="1">
1) CBS reporter Rita Braver doesn't want anyone to think
Republicans aren't just as guilty as Democrats when it come to
fundraising. On Sunday's Face the Nation (December 15), Braver
filled in for Bob Schieffer.
<BR>
<DD>
    Braver asked Gloria Borger of U.S. News & World Report: "We
counted this week, there are eleven different congressional
committees looking at Democratic fundraising, that's not to say
the Republicans don't have some problems, but that sounds like
it's going to be a pretty serious, time consuming issue."
<BR>
<DD>
    Borger responded by noting that "Today, on the front page of
The Washington Post, is a story about how the White House, as one
person said, has essentially become a Motel 6, renting out the
Lincoln Bedroom, giving it to people who are big contributors to
the party. This doesn't look good."
<BR>
<DD>
    Braver countered: "Is this any different than what happened,
because it seemed to me that I would over the years in Washington
run into some big, when Republicans were President, contributor
who'd say 'oh yeah, we spent the last night in the Lincoln
Bedroom.'"
<BR>
<DD>
    Borger disagreed with Braver's "everybody does it" line: "I
think it's more frequent though, I really do."
<P>
<a name="2">
2) Speaking of Sunday's Washington Post story, it didn't
exactly generate a lot of television news. The front page Post
story detailed how major contributors to the Democratic National
Committee are thanked with an overnight stay in the White House:
"The White House refuses to release guest lists, but three weeks
of logs turned over to Congress suggest the guest quarters were
in regular use." The Post story asserted: "So many big-money
donors have slept at the White House in recent years that one
Clinton fundraiser likens the executive mansion to a Motel 6."
<BR>
<DD>
Football killed NBC Nightly News in Washington, but neither
ABC's World News Sunday nor the CBS Evening News mentioned a word
December 15. Rita Braver filed a piece on the Chinese finding a
downed American plane from WWII. And CBS found time for a long
story from Jacqueline Adams on the discovery of a gene in the
fruit fly that controls sex and when altered causes male flies to
become bi-sexual.
<P>
<a name="3">
3) ABC, CBS and CNN fought to land top Clinton aide George
Stephanopoulos, but ABC News won the battle. The just-departed
Senior Adviser to the President will have a far greater role at
ABC than Bill Kristol, the former chief of staff for Vice
President Dan Quayle. While the Clintonite will spar with
conservative Kristol in discussions on This Week and Good Morning
America, The New York Times noted he also "is expected to do some
reporting as a correspondent." He'll produce longer pieces for GMA. 
<BR>
<DD>
How far were the other networks willing to go? As with ABC,
well beyond any position offered to former Reagan or Bush
administration political operatives. "A CNN source said
yesterday," The Washington Post's John Carmody reported December
12, "the cable network had been prepared to offer Stephanopoulos
his own weekend half-hour program and some other 'innovative
programming ideas.'" CBS News proposed a slot on Face the Nation
and a role in its upcoming Eye on People cable channel.
Carmody noted that ABC hopes "that if things go well,
Stephanopoulos's role can be expanded to include doing some
full-length programming for ABC-owned cable channels like Arts &
Entertainment and, particularly, the History Channel, where, said
Senior News Vice President Joanna Bistany yesterday, 'he can
explore the issues.'" If that's not enough, he'll "be available
in 1998 for political coverage."
<P>
<a name="4">
4) On ABC's World News Tonight on December 11 anchor Peter
Jennings introduced a story, as transcribed by MRC intern Joe
Alfonsi: "Now to children and poverty. There is a study today by
a private research group called the National Center for Children
in Poverty which believes that the government's official poverty
level is too low. And they find a disturbing trend about how and
where children are hurting."
<BR>
<DD>
Reporter Rebecca Chase began: "During the last fifteen years
this study found the number of children under the age of six
living in poverty grew from 3.5 million to 6.1 million. That's
one in every four children. And when families living on the edge
of poverty are included, using a cutoff of $28,000 a year for a
family of four, nearly half of all young children are living in
or near poverty. This means the United States has the highest
child poverty rate among industrialized nations."
<BR>
<DD>
Larry Aber of the National Center for Children in Poverty
then charged: "At the period of time when human beings are in
their most formative stages, we have the highest child poverty 
rates. We have the highest poverty rates. And we also make the
least public investments at that stage in life."
<BR>
<DD>
Of course the higher the income you define as poverty the
greater the number of children you can claim live in poverty. I
bet $28,000 -- about twice the official poverty level income for
a family of four -- goes a long way in many parts of the country.
And no word on whether the liberal group counted non-cash
benefits, such as Medicaid, food stamps and housing.
<P>
<a name="5">
5) In his new book titled "The Empty Church: The Suicide of
Liberal Christianity," Thomas Reeves argues that mainline
churches are becoming irrelevant as they cave into liberal
interest groups. Reviewing the book for the November 28 Boston
Globe, reporter Diego Ribadeneira was none too pleased with this
contention. He concluded: "For all their faults, mainline
denominations still lend an important moral voice to a nation
that seems to have become more mean-spirited toward the poor,
minorities, immigrants and gays. This moral dimension of liberal
Christianity is one Reeves fails to address."
<P>
<a name="6">
6) With the assistance of 57 judges across the country who
completed ballots in which they chose the first, second and third
best quotes in 18 categories, the MRC has just published THE BEST

<P>
Here are a few of the winners:
<ul>
<li><B>Good Morning Morons Award</B>
<BR>
"You write that you prayed more during your four years in office
than basically at any time in your life and yet I think it's fair
to say, and I hope this doesn't sound too harsh, I think it's
fair to say, you are consistently viewed as one of the more
ineffective Presidents of modern times....What do you think, if
anything, that says about the power of prayer?" <I>-- Bryant Gumbel
interviewing Jimmy Carter about his new book, Living Faith,
November 18 Today. [85 points]</I>
<li><B>Fear of the Competition Award (for Impugning Talk Radio)</B>
<BR>
<I>NBC's Bryant Gumbel:</I> "You mention talk radio. They [relatives of
Oklahoma bombing victims] have some very hard feelings about talk
radio and the hate being spewed by some of those on the far end
of the spectrum."
<br>
<dd>
<I>Bill Moyers:</I> "If anything, talk radio in that part of the world
is more anti-government today than ever. The airwaves are
saturated with hostility, it's just an unremitting vilification
of government. Sometimes it's, sometimes it's, you know, the
government makes mistakes and there are justifiable grievances
against government. But this is, this goes beyond that, it's
excessive. And these people take it like salt in the wound. They
drive around, they turn on their radio, they hear some vicious
attack on government, and they think, `You know, if you strike
the government, you kill my daughter.'" <I>-- Bill Moyers on the
April 12 Today promoting that night's Dateline on the families of
and victims of the Oklahoma City bombing. [105 points]</I>
<li><B>Damn Those Conservatives Award</B>
<BR>
"By being so nice to Pat Buchanan and treating him as a good guy
with bad policies, are we not all guilty of legitimizing his
views and putting a smiling face on a hateful voice?"<I> -- Today's
Bryant Gumbel on what he asked the show's political roundtable
off-air, quoted by Peter Johnson, Feb. 22 USA Today. [57]</I>
<li><B>If the Bias Fits, We Won't Admit Award (for Bias Denial)</B>
<BR>
"When you're talking about pure journalists, I mean reporters,
when you're talking about reporters, not columnists, I don't
think there's any liberal bias. I don't think there really ever
has been." <B>-- Los Angeles Times Senior Washington correspondent
Jack Nelson on CNBC's Politics '96, March 9. [71 points]</B>
<li><B>Quote of the Year</B>
<BR>
"In her Wednesday Commentary page column, Linda Bowles stated
that President Clinton and his former campaign adviser Dick
Morris both were `guilty of callous unfaithfulness to their wives
and children.' Neither man has admitted to being or been proven
to have been unfaithful. The Tribune regrets the error."  --
<B>Chicago Tribune correction, September 5. [88 points]</B>

7) The 1996-97 Family Guide to Prime Time Television is now
available from the Parents Television Council (PTC), a special
project of the Media Research Center. The 40-page booklet
provides a comprehensive study of this year's network prime time
fare -- from a family values perspective. The booklet evaluates

8) Last weekend liberal columnist Carl Rowan, who in his
new book tagged as "haters" everyone from Howard Stern to Rush
Limbaugh to Newt Gingrich to liberal columnist Richard Cohen,
made his last appearance on Inside Washington. Seen on PBS
stations around the country, the show is produced at Gannett-owned 
WUSA-TV in Washington, D.C. While panelists on shows like
the McLaughlin Group are paid a few hundred dollars per
appearance, Rowan had a bit of a better deal. 
<BR>
<DD>
Rowan is leaving because negotiations broke down over a new
contract. The December 13 Washington Post reported that Gannett
"insisted he take a 65 percent pay cut in his annual salary of
$123,00 and that he work without a contract."

$2,500 a week for a half hour show. Not a bad gig while it

Bryant Gumbel:
<blockquote>
<P>
 "You write that you prayed more during your four
years in office than basically at any time in your life and yet I
think it's fair to say, and I hope this doesn't sound harsh, I
think it's fair to say, you are consistently viewed as one of the
more ineffective Presidents of modern times."

Jimmy Carter:

 "Well, I think that's harsh and unfair, but you have
a right to your opinion."

What do you think, if anything, that says about the power of
prayer?"

<br>
"In the realm of honest graft, Clinton didn't do anything Bob Dole
didn't do; he and his party just did it with the seal of the White
House behind them." <DD>-- Time's Michael Duffy and Nancy Gibbs,
November 11.
<P>
"The intricate squalor of Democratic fundraising is the news of
the moment. But here's the big surprise: funny money is a
bipartisan indulgence. Here's another: Bob Dole -- gasp! -- is in
on the game. For most of his Senate career, Dole was the pro of
the quid pro quo. No one else has been more effective at working
the filigree of legislation, digging out just the groove to let
the American government's generosity flow unimpeded to his most
loyal supporters. And the GOP generally has engaged for years in
imaginative fundraising, and favors trading that would make
anybody blush." <DD>-- Time's Richard Lacayo, next page.
<P>
"Fortunately for Clinton, Dole had already blocked
campaign-finance reform and stuffed his pockets. (Ever hear of the
sugar-growing Cuban immigrant contributor or the $6 million fine
for a Republican with a money-laundering operation in Hong Kong?"

"Let's define what we mean by attacks on Kenneth Starr. It's fair
game to point out that he is a partisan Republican, that he
defends the tobacco interests...Yes! He got his job under very
seamy circumstances. That's fair game." <DD>-- Newsweek's Eleanor
Clift on the November 16 McLaughlin Group.
<P>
<br>
<b>vs.</b>
<P>
<br>
"Watergate was a criminal conspiracy conducted out of the Oval
Office. There is nothing even remotely like that alleged against
this President. We ought to wait and see what Ken Starr says. He's
the only one who has credibility, in my mind, in bringing forth
this investigation." <DD>-- Clift, later in the same show.

night coverage.

<CENTER><H3>Gorbachev, Impeccable Overachiever
</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<br>
"It mystifies Westerners that Mikhail Gorbachev is loathed and
ridiculed in his own country. This is the man who pulled the world
several steps back from the nuclear brink and lifted a crushing
fear from his countrymen, who ended bloody foreign adventures,
liberated Eastern Europe and won for the Soviet Union at least
provisional membership in the club of civilized nations. By the
standards of the West (and by comparison with the incumbent, Boris
Yeltsin), Mr. Gorbachev is a man of impeccable character." <DD>-- New
York Times foreign editor Bill Keller reviewing Gorbachev's
memoirs, October 20.

<CENTER><H3>It's Her Ideas, Stupid</H3></CENTER>
<P>

CBS reporter Rita Braver:
<blockquote>
<P>
 "But even abroad, Mrs. Clinton still
stirs up controversy at home. In a Time magazine interview she
talked about her plans to travel the U.S., monitoring the
administration's new welfare reform policies. Perhaps Mrs. Clinton
best expressed her own awkward situation when she told an
Australian audience that the only way for a First Lady to escape
criticism is to never express opinions or ideas."
</blockquote>
<P>
Hillary Clinton:
<P>
<blockquote>
"So it's a kind of difficult position and I think
the only answer is to just be who you are and do what you do and
get through it and wait for the first man to hold the position and
see how it turns out."

<CENTER><H3>Alger Hiss: Just Caught Up in Cold War Hysteria
</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<br>
"One of the most controversial men of the post-war years has died.
Alger Hiss, at the age of 92. He was a public servant of rising
prominence in the 1930s and 1940s when suddenly he was caught up
in a spy scandal and he was accused of being a member of the
Communist Party. In 1948 he was charged with helping pass State
Department secrets to the Soviets....Despite the support of many
prominent Americans, Hiss was sent to prison for almost four
years. It's a case that still divides many people in this country,
but at the end of his life Hiss considered vindication a
declaration by a Russian General, who controlled the KGB archives,
saying that Hiss had never been a spy." <DD>-- Tom Brokaw, November 15
NBC Nightly News. On November 18 Brokaw noted that "the Russian
General admitted he didn't have access to all records."
<P>
"Alger Hiss was an accomplished lawyer and a diplomat until a man
named Whittaker Chambers accused him of being a communist who
passed state secrets to the Soviets. At congressional hearings
Hiss defended himself against a young Richard Nixon. Hiss was
ultimately convicted of perjury. He lost his livelihood and his
marriage. He protested his innocence until the very end and last
year we reported that the Russian President Boris Yeltsin said
that KGB files had supported Mr. Hiss's claim." <DD>-- Peter Jennings,
November 15 World News Tonight. On November 19 Jennings issued a
"clarification," noting that "It was actually a member of Mr.
Yeltsin's staff, General Dmitri Volkogonov, who made the
statement. He later said that the evidence wasn't conclusive."
<P>
"Hiss was a Harvard-educated lawyer with a distinguished career in
government when he was accused in 1948 of helping pass secret
documents to the Soviets. The case attracted national attention
and helped spur a period of blacklisting and hysteria over the
communist threat." <DD>-- CNN Prime News anchor Linden Soles, November 15.
<p>
<BR>
<B>Reality Check: </B>
<br>
"For the last forty years...Hiss proclaimed his innocence. But
this year, the CIA declassified and released the so-called Venona
files, translations of actual intercepts of messages sent from the
Soviet Embassy in Washington back to Moscow. One, dated 30 March
1945, talks about the activities of a high level State Department
official turned Soviet agent code named A-L-E-S, Ales. His travel
schedule matched that of Alger Hiss. At the bottom of the cable,
there's a notation by an officer at the National Security Agency
saying Ales was probably, quote, Alger Hiss."<DD> -- Meet the Press
host Tim Russert, November 24.

<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>Very Questionable Sources of Information</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<br>
"This is the problem with the Internet: wonderful in some ways,
but more crazy conspiracy theories float around. If you get your
information from talk radio and the Internet, you believe a lot of
this nutty stuff." <DD>-- Newsweek's Evan Thomas on Pierre Salinger's
TWA 800 missile claim, November 10 Inside Washington.
<P>
"But in the end, one is left with a nagging sense that the
Dole-Kemp plan doesn't add up...and with a troubling question.
Having already tried supply-side tax cuts as the route to renewed
economic glory only to discover the nation strapped with
historically large deficits, why would we do it again?" <DD>-- Peter
G. Gosselin on the Dole-Kemp campaign manifesto Trust the People,
November 3 New York Times Book Review.

CNN's Brooks Jackson is usually one of the most balanced
and least gullible reporters on TV, taking on the campaign
rhetoric of both sides. But on Friday's (December 6) Inside
Politics he seemed to have let down his guard.
<P>
    Sitting beside substitute anchor Charles Bierbauer, he told
viewers: "Well, Charles, one of the more bizarre episodes may have
gotten a little less bizarre today. Back in October, attention
focused on the Buddhist temple in California where Democrats
raised $140,000 in an event attended by Vice President Al Gore.
The Wall Street Journal, back then, quoted a Buddhist nun who had
given $5,000 as saying the money was not hers, that it had been
given to her by the real donor who did not want to be identified.
But that would be illegal, so that was news, embarrassing to the
Vice President and to the Democratic Party. Now, that Buddhist nun
has changed her story and is saying the money was hers all along.
We are told she has filed a statement with the Federal Election
Commission, which is investigating, saying the money came not from
some secret donor but from her own savings and from offerings of
persons who supported her work at the temple, Charles."
<P>
<blockquote>
    Charles Bierbauer: "And, why do we suppose Brooks that she
might have once told the Wall Street Journal the money was not
hers?"
<P>
    Jackson: "We are told in this statement that she didn't know
quite how to handle a call from this national news reporter and
told what she hoped, or thought, was a harmless lie just to get
him off the phone. Turns out it was not so harmless."
<P>
</blockquote>
    How about a more logical scenario: When called by the reporter
she innocently told the truth. After DNC lawyers panicked they
came up with a legal explanation. Indeed, the December 2 Wall
Street Journal reported that "Democratic lawyer Peter Kelly"
became "closely involved with" allegations "that fraudulent
contributions may have been made to the Democratic Party during a
fundraising event at a Buddhist temple in California. 
<blockquote>    
<P>
"Mr. Kelly is a prominent Democratic fundraiser himself and
attended the temple event. After the controversy broke, he emerged
as the temple's lawyer...On the day that this newspaper published
a front page article quoting a Buddhist monk, Man Yah Shih, saying
she gave $5,000 at the fundraiser with money that wasn't hers, Mr.
Kelly called the woman and questioned her and was told
subsequently the same thing. Ms. Shih then left her temple for a
'retreat' overseas, from which she didn't return until after the
election. She now won't talk to reporters, referring all calls to
Mr. Kelly."

Here's a sentence apparently thought "outlandish" by New
York Times Supreme Court reporter Linda Greenhouse: "The powers
not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States
respectively, or to the people."
<P>
    That's the 10th Amendment. Here's her take on the Supreme
Court's review of the Brady gun control law. From the December 6
Washington Week in Review on PBS:
<blockquote>
<P>  
  "The Brady gun control law has been challenged, on of all
things, not on gun control grounds, but on federalism grounds, on
states rights grounds, because the bill has a provision that
requires local Sheriffs, the local law enforcement officials, to
do the background checks during the five day waiting period to
make sure a prospective gun purchaser is not a convicted felon.
And the local Sheriffs, backed by the National Rifle Association,
are arguing that this violates states rights because it in effect
is a commandeering by the federal government of the processes of
local government to make the locals officials do the Fed's work. 
And on the face of it, it sounds like a sort of outlandish
argument, you know, what local law enforcement officials do is
background checks, it's a very common kind of procedure. But this
argument has a lot of force these days because this case is part
on an ongoing review at the court and in the federal courts
generally about the whole relationship between the state and
federal government. So it's quite a potent argument, actually."

Sunday's Reliable Sources showed how the CNN program,
which is supposed to critique the news media, does anything but as
panelists pounce on anyone who dares draw attention to bias. 
<P>
    The December 8 guest panelist: former Washington Post reporter
William Powers, fresh from his inaugural New Republic piece on the
media. He's now a Senior Editor of the magazine. Regulars Marty
Schram of Scripps Howard, Bernard (I only own rust colored ties)
Kalb, Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post as well as Jane Shaw of
the Los Angles Times spent an entire segment attacking Powers. One
by one they argued how preposterous they found his thesis.
<P>
    And what did Powers assert? In his December 16 New Republic
piece he showed how the networks underplayed the Clinton character
issue during the campaign. After explaining how Clinton staffers 
convinced network producers to not air some stories, Powers 
explained:
<blockquote>
<P>
    "Why, besides the skill of its practitioners, has the White
House 'outreach' worked so well? Simply put, because Clinton and
his people are, to most journalists, culturally sympathetic. What
every conservative press critic preaches, and almost every
reporter denies, is largely true: the mainstream press is liberal.
Most Washington reporters share with the Clinton aides a language,
a value system, a set of buttons. Outrage at, say, 'partial birth
infanticide' is not one of the buttons of this class. Outrage at
'right-wing abortion activists' is.
<P>
    "When conservatives huff about the cabal of liberal
journalists that is constantly plotting to slant coverage, they
are right about the effects but wrong about the cause. There is no
plotting at all: liberal bias flows from principles so deeply held
they're mostly unconscious. All of which means that, had a
Republican President been up for re-election this year, facing the
same array of ethical problems Clinton faced, the scandals would
have gotten more ink. Recall the alacrity with which the
journalism establishment seized on the sexual allegations against
Clarence Thomas, John Tower and Bob Packwood."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Of course the MRC has never seen a plot, but it would be nice
if some media people of influence would realize this "unconscious"
bias before we put "former" before their name.

Thought you could escape from Bryant Gumbel after January
3, his last Today day? Friday's New York Post brought bad news.
The Post's Josef Adalian reported: 
<blockquote>
<P>
"There's an increasingly hard-to- ignore buzz among ABC News staffer that a deal between soon-to-depart 
Today show anchor Bryant Gumbel and ABC could be a match made in 
Nielsen heaven....Over the last few days speculation among ABC News 
insiders has become commonplace that...network execs are more than 
willing to guarantee Gumbel a 10pm Thursday newsmagazine showcase 
on ABC."

<a name="COLA">
1) A congressionally appointed panel reported Wednesday that
the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has overstated inflation, thus
leading to higher than necessary entitlement program payments. For
1996 they estimated the CPI was 1.1 percent too high. ABC and CBS
approached the issue not from the view of saving taxpayer money
but from the perspective of what recipients will lose and how such
an adjustment will mean more money for the government -- as if
it's the government's money that's being improperly spent. 
<P>
<DD>
    Here's how Peter Jennings led the December 4 World News
Tonight: "We begin tonight with money. Maybe a little less for
you, depending on who you are, and certainly a little more for
Uncle Sam."
<BR>
<DD>
    Reporter Lisa Stark then explained how "One third of the
federal budget is tied to the CPI, so cutting the official
inflation measurement 1.1 percent would lower all government
payments based on the cost of living, saving the government a
trillion dollars over the next twelve years. But cutting those
payments would affect 60 million Americans, including seniors who
stand to lose an average of $100 dollars a year in Social
Security."
<BR>
<DD>
    Patrick Burns of the National Council of Senior Citizens then
asserted: "It's a very simple, stealth, back door way of balancing
the budget. And it's really not based on science, it's based o
political opportunism."
<P>
<DD>
    Of course seniors wouldn't "lose" $100. They'll still get a
hike from the current payment.
<P>
<DD>
    On Wednesday's CBS Evening News Dan Rather, as usual,
forwarded the victim angle: "A plan officially proposed in
Washington today could effect the incomes of millions of
Americans, especially those older or at the lower end of the
economic scale." 
<BR>
<DD>
    Ray Brady elaborated: "From seniors to taxpayers, a special
congressional commission fired a shot today that could be felt by
anyone getting a government check."
<p>
<dd>
    Brady aired a soundbite from commission head Michael Boskin:
"The Consumer Price Index is substantially, substantially
overstating the true change in the cost of living by about 1.1
percentage points per year."
<br>
<dd>
    Brady continued: "Sound like economic gobbledygook? The
Consumer Price Index is the nation's main measure of inflation.
Government statisticians use it to figure out how much to pay in
food stamps, school lunches and Social Security, all of which go
up or down with inflation. Take the average Social Security check:
It will rise from $724 to $745 dollars a month in January, but it
would rise to just $737 dollars, a difference of eight dollars if
the congressional commission has its way."
<br>
<dd>
    Margrit Pittman, a Social Security recipient at a senior's
center illustrated the point: "For many people who come here,
eight dollars a month is a big loss. That may be the only eight
dollars they have to ever go to the movies."
<P>
<DD>
    There you have it. Transfer $13 per month more to Social
Security recipients, instead of $21 more, and they'll no longer be
able to see a movie. 
<P>
<a name="Dornan">
2) In his Monday (December 2) USA Today "Politics" column
reporter Richard Benedetto favorably examined the Carl Rowan and
Georgie Ann Geyer books which contend racial/ethnic tensions are
rising. Near the end Benedetto asserted: "Despite the authors'
bleak outlook, however, there were signs of hope in the last
elections." Benedetto cited three examples: First, five black
Congressmen won majority white districts; second, an Asian won the
race for Governor of Washington; and third:
<BR>
<DD>
    "Newly registered Hispanic-American voters provided critical
votes in many elections, most notably in the defeat of the
bombastic Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif."
<P>
<a name="foodstamps">
3) An editorial in the December 4 Washington Times noted
that Congressional Budget Office figures show "that the net effect
of welfare reform will be to increase annual federal poverty
spending by 7 percent per year through 2002." AFDC, food stamps,
Medicaid, SSI, child nutrition, etc. "will increase by 50 percent
from $198 billion in 1996 to $297 billion in 2002. With inflation
projected to average 2.8 percent a year, the 7 percent nominal
increase in federal poverty spending translates into an inflation-
adjusted increase of more than 4 percent a year."
<P>
<DD>
    That isn't the picture portrayed on network news. On the
Thanksgiving Day CBS Evening News substitute anchor Harry Smith
announced: "For the first time in decades the federal government
will no longer guarantee open-ended help to the poor. Case in 
point, food stamps. As Diana Olick reports, this could mean hunger
in America will grow, even in places famous for food and plenty of it."
<BR>
<DD>
    MRC intern Joe Alfonsi transcribed Olick's report from New
Orleans. She began: "In a city that celebrates every street
corner, where Cajun spice walks out of every doorway and century
old eateries lure patrons from all walks of life a drafty downtown
soup kitchen is preparing for an onslaught."
<br>
<dd>
   Olick went on to explain that "On March 1st, a provision in the
new welfare reform law will cut off food stamps to all able bodied 
adults ages 18 to 50 with no dependents, who don't have a job."
She found one not-so-hard working victim: "37 year old Denise Lee
has been on food stamps most of her life. She doesn't want to
work, but she's now planning to get a job. She fears though that
others will turn to crime instead to pay for food."
<br>
<dd>
    Denise Lee: "They say times is hard and crime is up and this
and that but they ain't seen nothing yet. They ain't seen
nothing."
<br>
<dd>
   Olick: "In the 35 year history of the food stamp program there
has never been a cut this drastic. More than one million people
nationwide will be affected. That's nearly 2,000 people in New
Orleans alone. But lawmakers say this cut is critical and the 
success of the welfare overhaul is riding on it."
<br>
<dd>
    Olick then allowed Ohio Congressman Robert Ney to argue: "This
is going to force the federal government, and the state
government, and the local government right down to the most local
levels to talk about how to help people, how to have opportunity."
<br>
<dd>
    Olick concluded "The cut in food stamps will force many people
to go to work. But in New Orleans, where there are more people
than jobs, some, like Denise Lee are worrying how they will carry
this new financial burden once the government stops carrying 
them. Diana Olick, CBS News, New Orleans."
<p>
<dd>
    Only at CBS is a 4 percent increase considered a "drastic
cut."
<P>
<a name="Atlanta">
4) Continuing CBS's victimization theme, MRC analyst Steve
Kaminski caught this story on homeless which aired on the December
1 CBS Evening News. Anchor John Roberts began: "All big cities
have homeless people, it's a growing problem marked by
controversy. What to do about it? Well, the city of Atlanta has an
answer: outlaw homelessness. But that approach, says Jim Axelrod,
is causing even more controversy."
<P>
<DD>
   Reporter Axelrod started by showing viewers a mother with kids
who must ride a bus each night to find shelter: "Like most
families, Xena Hampton and her kids have a bedtime ritual. Unlike
most families, their ritual is boarding a bus to find a bed.
Which, this night, takes them twenty miles away. They are
homeless, and now a new law could make them criminals."
<br>
<dd>
    Anita Beatty, homeless taskforce: "It's immoral, it's
unethical, it's, most probably, unconstitutional."
<br>
<dd>
    After another soundbite from a homeless advocate, Axelrod
continued: "The biggest problem Atlanta's homeless advocates have
with the new law is that most people targeted have nowhere else to
go. The shelters here, they say, have enough beds for one out of
seven people who need them."
<br>
<dd>
    Axelrod allowed Atlanta Council President Marvin Arrington
explain: "You've got to get up and go to work every day and that's
not being inhumane, that's caring about yourself and caring 
about the environment that you live in."
<br>
<dd>
    Axelrod also aired a clip of a Wendy's manager complaining
about a homeless man urinating in front of his restaurant, but
proceeded to end with a hit on the law: "Opponents of the law will
now head to the courts worried that Atlanta's solution to this
problem will soon spread across the country. Jim Axelrod CBS 
News, Atlanta." 
<br>
<dd>
We'll never run out of victims for CBS to portray.

Gumbel's Morning Devotions
<BR>
<DD>
<i>Bryant Gumbel:</i> "You write that you prayed more during your four
years in office than basically at any time in your life and yet I
think it's fair to say, and I hope this doesn't sound harsh, I
think it's fair to say, you are consistently viewed as one of the
more ineffective Presidents of modern times."
<br>
<dd>
<i>Jimmy Carter:</i> "Well, I think that's harsh and unfair, but you have
a right to your opinion."
<br>
<dd>
<i>Gumbel:</i> "It's not mine. It's what I perceive as a general view.
What do you think, if anything, that says about the power of
prayer?" -- Exchange on Today about Carter's new book, Living
Faith, November 18.
<p>
<dd>
Time Does DNC Damage Control
<br>
<dd>
"In the realm of honest graft, Clinton didn't do anything Bob Dole
didn't do; he and his party just did it with the seal of the White
House behind them." <i>-- Time's Michael Duffy and Nancy Gibbs,
November 11.</i>
<br>
<dd>
"The intricate squalor of Democratic fundraising is the news of
the moment. But here's the big surprise: funny money is a
bipartisan indulgence. Here's another: Bob Dole -- gasp! -- is in
on the game. For most of his Senate career, Dole was the pro of
the quid pro quo. No one else has been more effective at working
the filigree of legislation, digging out just the groove to let
the American government's generosity flow unimpeded to his most
loyal supporters. And the GOP generally has engaged for years in
imaginative fundraising, and favors trading that would make
anybody blush." <i>-- Time's Richard Lacayo, next page.</i>
<br>
<dd>
"Fortunately for Clinton, Dole had already blocked
campaign-finance reform and stuffed his pockets. (Ever hear of the
sugar-growing Cuban immigrant contributor or the $6 million fine
for a Republican with a money-laundering operation in Hong Kong?)"
<i>-- Time columnist Margaret Carlson, same issue.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Eleanor "Sybil" Clift
<br>
<dd>
"Let's define what we mean by attacks on Kenneth Starr. It's fair
game to point out that he is a partisan Republican, that he
defends the tobacco interests...Yes! He got his job under very
seamy circumstances. That's fair game." <i>-- Newsweek's Eleanor
Clift on the November 16 McLaughlin Group.</i>
<br>
<dd>
<b>vs.</b>
<br>
<dd>
"Watergate was a criminal conspiracy conducted out of the Oval
Office. There is nothing even remotely like that alleged against
this President. We ought to wait and see what Ken Starr says. He's
the only one who has credibility, in my mind, in bringing forth
this investigation." <i>-- Clift, later in the same show.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Fabulous Clinton Cabinet
<br>
<dd>
"Brian Williams, I have a question. You've been covering the
Clinton White House for some time. Do you think that there is any
more heroic figure, however not very visible, than Bob Rubin, who
is the Treasury Secretary?" <i>-- Tom Brokaw during NBC News election
night coverage.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Gorbachev, Impeccable Overachiever
<br>
<dd>
"It mystifies Westerners that Mikhail Gorbachev is loathed and
ridiculed in his own country. This is the man who pulled the world
several steps back from the nuclear brink and lifted a crushing
fear from his countrymen, who ended bloody foreign adventures,
liberated Eastern Europe and won for the Soviet Union at least
provisional membership in the club of civilized nations. By the
standards of the West (and by comparison with the incumbent, Boris
Yeltsin), Mr. Gorbachev is a man of impeccable character." <i>-- New
York Times foreign editor Bill Keller reviewing Gorbachev's
memoirs, October 20.</i>
<p>
<dd>
It's Her Ideas, Stupid
<br>
<dd>
<i>CBS reporter Rita Braver:</i> "But even abroad, Mrs. Clinton still
stirs up controversy at home. In a Time magazine interview she
talked about her plans to travel the U.S., monitoring the
administration's new welfare reform policies. Perhaps Mrs. Clinton
best expressed her own awkward situation when she told an
Australian audience that the only way for a First Lady to escape
criticism is to never express opinions or ideas."
<i>Hillary Clinton:</i> "So it's a kind of difficult position and I think
the only answer is to just be who you are and do what you do and
get through it and wait for the first man to hold the position and
see how it turns out." <i>-- CBS Evening News story, November 25.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Alger Hiss: Just Caught Up in Cold War Hysteria
<br>
<dd>
"One of the most controversial men of the post-war years has died.
Alger Hiss, at the age of 92. He was a public servant of rising
prominence in the 1930s and 1940s when suddenly he was caught up
in a spy scandal and he was accused of being a member of the
Communist Party. In 1948 he was charged with helping pass State
Department secrets to the Soviets....Despite the support of many
prominent Americans, Hiss was sent to prison for almost four
years. It's a case that still divides many people in this country,
but at the end of his life Hiss considered vindication a
declaration by a Russian General, who controlled the KGB archives,
saying that Hiss had never been a spy." <i>-- Tom Brokaw, November 15
NBC Nightly News. On November 18 Brokaw noted that "the Russian
General admitted he didn't have access to all records."</i>
<br>
<dd>
"Alger Hiss was an accomplished lawyer and a diplomat until a man
named Whittaker Chambers accused him of being a communist who
passed state secrets to the Soviets. At congressional hearings
Hiss defended himself against a young Richard Nixon. Hiss was
ultimately convicted of perjury. He lost his livelihood and his
marriage. He protested his innocence until the very end and last
year we reported that the Russian President Boris Yeltsin said
that KGB files had supported Mr. Hiss's claim." <i>-- Peter Jennings,
November 15 World News Tonight. On November 19 Jennings issued a
"clarification," noting that "It was actually a member of Mr.
Yeltsin's staff, General Dmitri Volkogonov, who made the
statement. He later said that the evidence wasn't conclusive."</i>
<br>
<dd>
"Hiss was a Harvard-educated lawyer with a distinguished career in
government when he was accused in 1948 of helping pass secret
documents to the Soviets. The case attracted national attention
and helped spur a period of blacklisting and hysteria over the
communist threat." <i>-- CNN Prime News anchor Linden Soles, November 15.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Reality Check:
<br>
<dd>
"For the last forty years...Hiss proclaimed his innocence. But
this year, the CIA declassified and released the so-called Venona
files, translations of actual intercepts of messages sent from the
Soviet Embassy in Washington back to Moscow. One, dated 30 March
1945, talks about the activities of a high level State Department
official turned Soviet agent code named A-L-E-S, Ales. His travel
schedule matched that of Alger Hiss. At the bottom of the cable,
there's a notation by an officer at the National Security Agency
saying Ales was probably, quote, Alger Hiss." <i>-- Meet the Press
host Tim Russert, November 24.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Very Questionable Sources of Information
<br>
<dd>
"This is the problem with the Internet: wonderful in some ways,
but more crazy conspiracy theories float around. If you get your
information from talk radio and the Internet, you believe a lot of
this nutty stuff." <i>-- Newsweek's Evan Thomas on Pierre Salinger's
TWA 800 missile claim, November 10 Inside Washington.</i>
<br>
<dd>
"But in the end, one is left with a nagging sense that the
Dole-Kemp plan doesn't add up...and with a troubling question.
Having already tried supply-side tax cuts as the route to renewed
economic glory only to discover the nation strapped with
historically large deficits, why would we do it again?" <i>-- Peter
G. Gosselin on the Dole-Kemp campaign manifesto Trust the People,
November 3 New York Times Book Review.</i>

<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>1)  </FONT>On Monday's CBS Evening News (November 25), 
Rita Braver reviewed First Lady Hillary Clinton's activities while
accompanying the President in Asia. Braver relayed that 
<P>
<blockquote>
"Her theme has been equality and opportunity for women, whether
speaking to thousands or to just a few. In Bangkok, she
comforted a former prostitute now dying of AIDS. And 
later made the point that if women are educated they are not
forced to turn to prostitution."  
 </blockquote>
<P>    
Following a clip of Mrs. Clinton, Braver continued:
 <P>
<blockquote>    
"But even abroad, Mrs. Clinton still stirs up controversy at
home. In a Time magazine interview, she talked about her plans
to travel the U.S., monitoring the administration's new welfare
reform policies. The White House immediately denied that 
the First Lady will have any formal role. Perhaps Mrs. Clinton
best expressed her own awkward situation when she told an
Australian audience that the only way for a First Lady to escape
criticism is never to express opinions or ideas."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Hillary Clinton:
<P>
<blockquote>
 "So it's a kind of difficult position and I
think the only answer is to just be who you are and do what you
do and get through it and wait for the first man to hold the
position and see how that turns out."
<P> 
</blockquote>   
Braver: 
<P>
<blockquote>
"And sources close to the First Lady say she is
still struggling to define exactly what her role will be in her
husbands next term. How to do work that is important 
but not controversial. Rita Braver CBS News, Bangkok, Thailand."
</blockquote>
<P>
    Hmmm. Maybe it's not that she expresses ideas, maybe it's
the socialist ideas that she expresses that people don't like.

A CyberAlert recipient alerted me to a November 25
Reuters story on the same topic that he saw in Yahoo, from where
I downloaded the story headlined "Hillary's Role on Welfare
Played Down."
<P>
    The piece, datelined Manila, began: "Hillary Rodham Clinton
was at the center of a new controversy on Monday after she
suggested she wanted a 'formal role' in shaping policy on U.S.
welfare reform."
<P>
    Several paragraphs later the Reuters dispatch asserted:
<P>
<blockquote>
    "A draconian welfare reform measure passed by the Republican
Congress and signed into law by Clinton at the height of the
U.S. presidential campaign in October ends a 60-year guarantee
of federal aid to the poor. It is expected to deprive at least a
million people of public assistance over the next few years."

 Monday's resignation by FDA Commissioner David Kessler
received full stories on all the evening newscasts November 25.
But NBC's Robert Hager provided the most glowing assessment of
the man who fought to expand the agency's regulatory power.
<P>
    As transcribed by MRC intern Joe Alfonsi, here's Hager's NBC
Nightly News story:
<P>
<blockquote>
    "Kessler was controversial from the start, loved going after
the big guys, set the tone immediately six years ago by telling
Proctor & Gamble to get the word 'fresh' off its frozen orange
juice. When the company ignored him, Kessler began seizing the
product. P&G backed down. Later Kessler reformed the way we
label all foods, developed a whole new system for listing fat,
cholesterol, and nutrients. Kessler had a law degree from the
University of Chicago and an MD from Harvard Medical. And he was
bipartisan too, appointed by the Republican Bush, kept on by the
Democrat Clinton."
</blockquote>
<P>    
Hager continued:
<P>
<blockquote>
 "But all this was prelude to his landmark
decision to go after big tobacco, some of the nation's
wealthiest corporations. Call cigarettes a drug, he said, and
regulate them. It had been assumed that Kessler would stay in
office to defend the new regulations from tobacco companies and
see the regulations implemented, perhaps some, by next spring.
But he's reportedly being pursued by several universities and
his wife, once a Manhattan lawyer, is known to have tired of
Washington politics. Also there was recent flap over some of his
expense accounts uncovering dozens of errors and forcing Kessler
to write an $850 reimbursement check to the government. And all
along Kessler had no shortage of detractors."
</blockquote>
<P>
    Following a soundbite from Newt Gingrich on how Kessler was
too cautious in approving drugs and praise from Congressman
Henry Waxman, Hager concluded: "So Kessler will move on, leaving
history to judge the difference he may have made in American
health."
<P>
    Hager spent so much time hyping Kessler's activities as
accomplishments that NBC viewers never learned the other side
from those who thought Kessler symbolized the worst of the
nanny-state. As a November 27 Boston Herald editorial argued:
<P>
<blockquote>
"He thought -- he said -- the brand name 'Fresh Choice' was
misleading. Never mind that right under the name it said 'made
from concentrate.' With no evidence of harm but anecdotes spread
by plaintiffs lawyers so cherished by the Clinton
administration, Kessler ordered silicone breast implants off the
market. After the publication of two impeccable studies that
demolished the case against implants, Kessler has declined to
end the ban, condemning thousands of women to inferior
substitutes."

 Discussing politics with husband and wife team James
Carville and Mary Matalin on the November 24 Meet the Press,
host Tim Russert asked Matalin: 
<P>
<blockquote>
    "A week before the inauguration in January, the Supreme
Court's going to hear arguments about sexual harassment charges
filed by Paula Jones. Stuart Taylor in the American Lawyer, a
long piece where he lays out the charges by Paula Jones against
Bill Clinton, Anita Hill against Clarence Thomas and says the
evidence involving Jones is overwhelming compared to that of
Anita Hill. Mary Matalin, how big of a political story 
and a media story is this going to be?"
</blockquote>
<P>   
 Well, so far it hasn't been much of one. As far as I've seen
it still hasn't been mentioned on Nightly News or Today. In
fact, the only broadcast network coverage it's gotten was in a
late October World News Tonight story in which ABC's Jeff
Greenfield used the lack of coverage given the blockbuster
article as an example of why conservatives see liberal bias.
<P>
<BR>
<a name="5">
<hr width=33% align=left>
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>5)  </FONT>Later in the same Meet the Press (November 24) Russert
played a tape of Whittaker Chambers on the old Meet the Press
radio show during which he accused Alger Hiss of being a spy.
<P>
    Two points here. First, reporters were as skeptical about
the guilt of Hiss in 1948 as they were this year when he died.
Second, after the clip, Russert actually laid out the evidence,
something Nightly News never did.
<P>
    From the Friday, August 27, 1948 at 10pm Meet the Press
radio show, here are some of the questions posed to Chambers:   
<P>
Nat Finney, Cowles Publications:
<blockquote>
<P> "I thought you left it a
little unclear as to whether you are certain in your mind, now,
whether Alger Hiss is now a member of the Communist Party or
not."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Chambers: 
<P>
<blockquote>
"I would not presume to say whether Mr. Hiss is or
is not a member of the Communist Party."
</blockquote>
<P>    
Finney:
<P>
<blockquote> "You mean to say that you have not made a check to
find out whether he, as you, has recanted."
</blockquote>
<P>    
Chambers:
<P>
<blockquote> "I have no possibility of making such a charge.
The House Committee on Un-American Activities subpoenaed me to
tell what I knew about the Communist Party at the time that Mr.
Hiss was a member. I have testified on that, I have not 
presumed to testify what he is now."
</blockquote>
<P>    
Tom Reynolds, Chicago Sun-Times:
<P>
<blockquote> "Are you prepared at this
time, to say that Alger Hiss was anything more than, in your
opinion, a Communist? Did he do anything wrong? Did he commit
any overt act? Has he been disloyal to his country?"
</blockquote>
<P>    
Chambers:
<P>
<blockquote> "I am only prepared, at this time, to say that he
was a Communist."
</blockquote>
<P>    
Reynolds:
<P>
<blockquote> "It seems to me then sir, if I may say so, that in
some respects this may be a tempest in a teapot. You say that
you think he was a Communist, you say he was a Communist but you
will not accuse him of any act that is disloyal to the United
States."
</blockquote>
<P>
    Chambers: 
<P>
<blockquote>"I am not prepared, legally, to make that charge.
My whole interest in this business has been to show that Mr.
Hiss was a Communist."
   </blockquote>
<P>
    Back to 1996, Russert explained that "Hiss sued Whittaker
Chambers for slander, for what he said on Meet the Press"
and Hiss was later convicted of perjury for his congressional
testimony "because the statute of limitations on espionage had
expired."
 <P>
    Russert then explained: "For the last 40 years until he died
last week at age 92, Alger Hiss proclaimed his innocence. But
this year, the CIA declassified and released the so called 
Venona files, translations of actual intercepts of messages sent
from the Soviet Embassy in Washington back to Moscow. One, dated
30 March, 1945, talks about the activities of a high level State 
Department official, turned Soviet agent, code named A-L-E-S,
ALES. His travel schedule matched that of Alger Hiss. At the
bottom of the cable, there's a notation by an officer at 
the National Security Agency saying ALES, A-L-E-S was probably,
quote Alger Hiss." 
<P>
    As you saw in past CyberAlerts, when Hiss died Tom Brokaw
said he was "caught up" in a spy scandal. NBC Nightly News made
no mention of the Venona files. In fact, when they were released
this past Spring, of the broadcast networks, only the CBS
Evening News did a story (by David Martin).

Under the heading "Conan goes to Canada...early" in the
November 30 Boston Globe "Names & Faces" column, reporter M. L.
Montgomery wrote: "Add Canada to Yogi Berra's list of places
where it gets late early: Late Night with Conan O'Brien will air
on CNBC at 10pm, giving the lad his first non-insomniac
audience. It'll air a month after U.S. broadcasts, but hey,
those Turkey Jokes will recycle nicely for Boxing Day."
<P>
    Send M.L. back to the copy desk. CNBC is a U.S. cable
channel and it will air O'Brien repeats nightly at 10pm ET
(that's 7pm in British Columbia). Reporter Montgomery has
confused CNBC, the Consumer News & Business Channel, with the
CBC, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
<P>

The last CyberAlert reported how Peter Jennings and Tom
Brokaw last Friday (November 15) suggested Alger Hiss was
vindicated before his death. Tom Brokaw said Hiss was innocently
"caught up in a spy scandal" and "considered vindication a
declaration by a Russian General...saying that Hiss had never
been a spy." Jennings claimed that "Boris Yeltsin said that KGB
files had supported Mr. Hiss's claim" of innocence.
<P>
    Since then I've come across another instance of a network
assuming he was victimized by anti-communism. On Friday's The
News with Brian Williams last week on MSNBC substitute anchor
Brigitte Quinn told viewers, as transcribed by MRC intern Joe
Alfonsi:
<P>
<blockquote> 
    "Alger Hiss was a symbol of the cold war and the McCarthy
witch hunts that haunted that era. And his public disgrace
propelled Richard Nixon to the White House. Hiss died today at 
a New York City hospital. He was four days shy of his 93rd
birthday. Hiss was a brilliant lawyer and teacher until 1948 when
a man named Whittaker Chambers accused Hiss of giving him State
Department secrets to pass to the Soviets. An ambitious
Congressman named Richard Nixon lead the prosecution against
Hiss, who was convicted and sent to prison. The publicity helped
win Nixon the vice presidential nomination in 1952. As for Hiss,
he fought for vindication for the rest of his life. In 1987 a
Russian General declared that Hiss was never a spy but a victim
of cold war hysteria."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Did she say 1987? Yes, she did.   
<P>
    On Monday's NBC Nightly News (November 18), Tom Brokaw issued
a correction:
<P>
<blockquote>
    "Last week on this program we reported on the death of Alger
Hiss, the establishment intellectual who was the center of a long
bitter debate about his Communist Party credentials and suspected
Soviet spy activity. Late in his life, we reported, he felt
vindicated by a Russian General's claim that there were no
records to support the claims that Hiss was a spy. However, the 
Russian General admitted he didn't have access to all records."
<P>
</blockquote>
    The next night, Tuesday, November 19, Peter Jennings got
around to noting his error. On World News Tonight he stated:
<P>
<blockquote>    
"We have a clarification tonight of something we reported on 
Friday. In the obituary of Alger Hiss, we reported that Russian
President Boris Yeltsin had said that KGB files supported Hiss'
contention that he had never spied for the Soviets as he insisted
all his life. It was actually a member of Mr. Yeltsin's staff,
General Dmitri Volkogonov who made the statement. He later said
that the evidence wasn't conclusive because there were other
Soviet intelligence agencies whose files were not available."
</blockquote>
<P>    
The networks have now conceded the evidence of his innocence
is not solid, but viewers never a got a full understanding of the
depth of proof of his guilt.

 Revelations about John Huang continue to make the front
pages of newspapers, but the television networks have nearly
blacked out the entire scandal. Last week we reported that of the
broadcast network evening shows only ABC's World News Tonight, on
November 12, reported that the Commerce Dept. had launched an
investigation of John Huang to see if he really cut off ties to
the Lippo Group. The last CyberAlert detailed how a series of
revelations in the Washington Post, Wall Street Journal and New
York Times never made it onto the ABC, CBS and NBC evening shows. 
<P>
    Picking up where that list left off, here's a run down on
coverage this week that I compiled with the assistance of MRC
analysts Steve Kaminski and Gene Eliasen. This review includes the
three evening shows, plus CNN's The World Today (10pm ET) as well
as GMA, This Morning and Today from Sunday through Thursday.
<P>
<blockquote>  
<UL>
<LI>  In five mornings, GMA mentioned Huang in one newscast one
morning. Today and CBS This Morning devoted half of one story.
<LI> In five evenings, ABC raised Huang in two anchor-read
items. CBS devoted one full story. In four nights (no Nightly
News on Sunday) NBC aired one anchor-read brief. 
</UL>
</blockquote>
<P>
<CENTER><H4>Sunday, November 17.</H4></CENTER>
<P>
The day after the front page of the New York Times reported that President Clinton 
had met with and discussed Indonesian policy with James Riady, the former employer
of John Huang. Also, the DNC announced that Huang was let go as
part of post-election reductions.
<P> 
       CNN's The World Today and ABC's World News Tonight: Brief
anchor-read mentions of Huang leaving the DNC. Nothing on Riady
on any show.
<P>
<CENTER><H4>Monday, November 18.</H4></CENTER>
<P>
 Los Angeles Times reported that Huang, who claimed he severed contact with Lippo 
when he joined Commerce, made 70 phone calls at Commerce to the Lippo Bank in
Los Angeles. The Washington Times reported that Huang lobbied to
open trade with Vietnam, a position advocated by his former
employer.
<P>
         In the morning, nothing on Today or This Morning. One
mention on GMA of Huang's firing. In the evening, nothing on CBS
Evening News and NBC Nightly News. On ABC Jennings did brief item
on the 70 calls. CNN's World Today aired full story by Bob
Franken on Huang-Lippo connections. Franken even noted the money
returned from an April fundraiser at a Buddhist Temple attended
by Al Gore.

 "Close Aide to Clinton Urged Less Candor Over Indonesian" declared

Bruce Lindsey advised describing Clinton's meetings with Indonesian billionaire 
James Riady as "social calls" though after the campaign the White House
admitted policy was discussed.

         In the morning, nothing on GMA, Today or This Morning. In
the evening, nothing on ABC, CBS or NBC. The specifics weren't
spelled out on CNN's The World Today, but Wolf Blitzer did report
on a Clinton press conference in Australia that took place at
about 9pm ET:
<P>
<blockquote> 
"Sensitive questions involving a former Democratic Party
fundraiser's activities continue to chase President Clinton here
to Australia, his first overseas trip since his re-election. At a
joint news conference with Prime Minister John Howard, President
Clinton warned reporters not to rush to judgment about all of
this, including his friend and former Democratic Party fundraiser
John Huang. He compared all of this to the highly publicized case
of Richard Jewell who was wrongly accused of planting a bomb at
the Olympic games in Atlanta."
<P>         
 Clinton: "...One of the things I would urge you to do,
remembering what happened to Mr. Jewell in Atlanta, remembering
what has happened to so many of the accusations over the last
four years that have bee made against me that turned out to be
totally baseless, I just think that we ought to make sure, we
ought to just get the facts out. And they should be reported
That's what I've encouraged everybody to do."
<P>          
Blitzer: "Mr. Clinton says he's encouraging all of his a
ides to fully cooperate and he denies that there's any official
stonewalling."

 The above press conference is still fresh news and the DNC announces that it has 
returned $253,000 to a Thai businesswoman who had donated funds that were
really from a citizen of Thailand.
<P>          
In the morning, nothing on GMA. Both Today and This
Morning devote half of one story to Clinton's Jewell analogy.
On CBS This Morning Bill Plante reported:
<blockquote>
<P>
          "....Mr. Clinton could not avoid the controversy over
		contributions to the Democrats by wealthy Asians. Asked if his
		staff had stonewalled the issue before the election, he replied
		that he had answered all the questions asked of him and then
		compared himself with Olympic security guard Richard Jewell."
<P>
          Clinton: "One of the things I would urge you to do,
		remembering what happened to Mr. Jewell in Atlanta, remembering
		what has happened to so many of the accusations over the last
		four years that have bee made against me that turned out to be
		totally baseless."
<P>          
		Plante: "In fact, the question of whether those
		accusations are baseless or not is likely to shadow Mr. Clinton's
		next couple of years, but he's not likely to have to deal with
		them again on this trip because the next three days in Australia
		are mostly R&R. And tomorrow he gets the chance to do what he
		really wanted to do and that's 18 holes of golf with champion
		Greg Norman."
</blockquote>
<P>
  Of course, a CBS viewer would have no idea what he
stonewalled.
<P>
          In the evening, ABC aired nothing, NBC's Tom Brokaw
mentioned the Thai money return and CBS Evening News actually
aired a full story. Rita Braver highlighted the Jewell analogy:   
<blockquote>
<P>          
"Questions keep swirling around former Lippo Group Vice
President, John Huang. Appointed by the White House to a high
Commerce Department post then transferred to a job as a top
Democratic National Committee fund-raiser. And at a news
conference, the President was asked about new allegations that
his staff deliberately delayed releasing information about
Huang's activities until after the election. A major issue, newly
disclosed White House meetings where Huang and his former Lippo
boss, James Riady discussed policy matters with Mr. Clinton. But
though some contributions Huang raised may have been illegal, Mr.
Clinton compared both Huang and himself to Richard Jewell, a man
the FBI incorrectly identified as a suspect in the Atlanta
Olympics bombing."
</blockquote>
<P>
          After a clip of Clinton claiming "I just think that we
ought to make sure we've got, you know, we ought to just get the
facts out," Braver offered a tough conclusion: "But many of those
involved in the controversy have refused to discuss their roles.
And privately, some White House aides are appalled because of the
appearance created by the unusual access of the Lippo Group." 
<P>

 Nothing on any broadcast network
show. I did not get a chance to check CNN.
<P>
    Concluding his November 18 story CNN's Bob Franklin
suggested: "John Huang may have lost his job, but neither he nor
the controversy he's the center of is about the fade away.
Congressional Republicans will see to that."

Jimmy Carter appeared on Today Monday (November 18) to
plug his new book, "Living Faith." Here's an exchange with Bryant
Gumbel in which Gumbel implicates prayer with Carter's poor
presidential performance:
<P> 
<blockquote> 
  Gumbel: "You write that you prayed more during your four
years in office than basically at any time in your life and yet I
think it's fair to say, and I hope this doesn't sound harsh, I
think it's fair to say, you are consistently viewed as one of the
more ineffective Presidents of modern times."
<P>    
Carter: "Well, I think that's harsh and unfair, but you have
a right to your opinion."
<P>    
Gumbel: "It's not mine. It's what I perceive as a general
view. What do you think, if anything, that says about the power
of prayer?"

Thursday night NBC Nightly News aired another segment of
its Who Cares series on charitable giving. Over video of the
Statue of Liberty, Tom Brokaw began:
<blockquote>
<P>
    "She's a symbol of hope for those seeking a better life, the
words given to us by poet Emma Lazarus. So, when the welfare
reform bill was passed by Congress this year, a bill that slashed
aid to legal immigrants, deep cuts, some $22 billion dollars
philanthropist George Soros reacted immediately, creating a $50
fund and he named it after Emma Lazarus."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Brokaw asked Soros:
<blockquote> 
<P>
"You just gave a lot of money for
immigrants because you worry immigrants, in the eyes of some
people in this country, pariahs."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Brokaw continued:
<P>
<blockquote>
 "His swift and deeply personal response to
the welfare reform bill comes at a time when many are asking
whether private giving can compensate for government cuts in
social services."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Brokaw did give Arianna Huffington a chance to explain the
benefits of personal charity, but it's amazing how year after
year there are "cuts in social services" yet the budget keeps
soaring.

Boston held its Achievement in Radio Awards luncheon
Wednesday. The master of ceremonies: Charles Osgood of CBS. The
Boston Globe's Susan Bickelhaupt reported Thursday: 
<P>
<blockquote>
"As he introduced Gina (he didn't share her last name) as the one who
would hand out the awards, he took note of the catcalls and
whistles that greeted her as she took the stage in a floor-length, 
backless green gown. He then asked her to turn around, telling 
the audience, 'There are two sides to people, a front and
a back.'"
</blockquote>
<P>
    As the Boston Herald's Inside Track column observed about
Osgood making "the shapely award presenter...model her

 Thursday the MRC's Free Market Project released a joint
study conducted with a group called Consumer Alert. The study
examined 13 magazines: Better Homes & Gardens, Family Circle,
Glamour, Good Housekeeping, Ladies' Home Journal, Mademoiselle,
McCall's, Parents, Prevention, Redbook, Weight Watchers, Women's
Day, and Working Woman.
<P>
    Following is the front page summary of the 12 page study. The
entire report will soon be on our <A HREF="http://www.mediaresearch.org/">web site</A>
, but for more information, to arrange an interview or to get a copy, e-mail

<P>
High-circulation women's and family magazines use most of their
ink to focus on lifestyle issues -- relationships between dating
and married couples, parenting, home decorating, fashions and
personal care, and dieting. Surprisingly, many also deal with
public policy issues relating to government activism and women's
and families' health and safety.
<P>
A joint Consumer Alert/Media Research Center study of 13 women's
and family magazines analyzed the October 1995 through September
1996 issues for their policy-oriented coverage. Part I of the
study reviewed whether expansion of government programs was
depicted positively or negatively. Part II looked at the
magazines' depiction of risk in discussing public policy issues
relating to health and safety. The study found:
<P>
<blockquote>
<UL>
<LI> In the 13 magazines studied, there were 115 positive
portrayals of government activism and/or calls for more. There
were only 18 negative portrayals and/or calls for less.
<LI> Twenty-three stories went beyond promoting bigger government
they also asked readers to lobby government officials on behalf
of expanded government programs.
<LI> In 56 articles or mentions of science and risk issues, 35 were
one-sided and did not acknowledge a skeptical view that the risks
depicted were minor and the alarmist views presented go against
mainstream science.
<LI> According to women's magazines, recycling is always good. Out
of 15 stories that mentioned recycling, there was not one
skeptical argument presented that sometimes recycling is
impractical and wastes resources.
<LI> Women's magazines featured numerous warnings about unsafe
drinking water, yet routinely bashed chlorine as unsafe, even
though chlorine provides the most effective protection against
waterborne diseases.
</UL>
</blockquote>
<P>
<B>Recommendations:</B>
<P>
<BR> 
Look for balance in coverage of public policy
issues. Note who the spokespersons are for a particular point of
view. Is there a pattern in who is depicted as the good guys (or
gals) and bad guys? Be skeptical of articles that provide only
anecdotal information instead of scientific evidence.

<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>1)  </FONT> Reporting the death of Alger Hiss, in the November 16
Washington Times, reporter Carelton Bryant noted that "Hiss's
supporters and detractors often have camped on opposite sides of
the political spectrum. Liberals, such as Adlai Stevenson and
John Foster Dulles, defended Hiss, saying charges against him
were the product of a communist witch hunt. Conservatives, such
as William F. Buckley and J. Edgar Hoover, castigated Hiss,
saying he was one of many left-leaning intellectuals swayed by
the communists' economic rhetoric during the Great Depression."
<P>
    Guess which point of view the networks took Friday night?
<P>
    On the November 15 <I>World News Tonight</I> Peter Jennings
announced:
<P>
<blockquote> 
    "We learned late today that a very controversial American had
died. Alger Hiss was an accomplished lawyer and a diplomat until
a man named Whittaker Chambers accused him a being a communist
who passed state secrets to the Soviets. At congressional
hearings Hiss defended himself against a young Richard Nixon.
Hiss was ultimately convicted of perjury. He lost his livelihood
and his marriage. He protested his innocence until the very end
and last year we reported that the Russian President Boris
Yeltsin said that KGB files had supported Mr. Hiss's claim. He
was 92 when he died today."
<P>
</blockquote>
    On CNN's <I>Prime News</I> anchor Linden Soles told viewers: 
<P>   
<blockquote>
 "Alger Hiss, the man at the center of a Cold War spy scandal,
has died at age 92. Hiss was a Harvard educated lawyer with a
distinguished career in government when he was accused in 1948 of
helping pass secret documents to the Soviets. The case attracted
national attention and helped spurn a period of blacklisting and
hysteria over the communist threat. Richard Nixon's political
career got a major boost after his aggressive efforts in Congress
against Hiss. Hiss was later convicted of perjury and spent the
rest of his life trying to clear his name."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Tom Brokaw, on NBC <I>Nightly News</I>, declared: 
<P>
<blockquote>   
 "One of the most controversial men of the post-war years has
died. Alger Hiss, at the age of 92. He was a public servant of
rising prominence in the 1930s and 1940s when suddenly he was
caught up in a spy scandal and he was accused of being a member
of the Communist Party. In 1948 he was charged with helping pass
State Department secrets to the Soviets. His case drew
unprecedented attention and he was pursued tenaciously by a
freshman Congressman -- Richard Nixon. Despite the support of
many prominent Americans, Hiss was sent to prison for almost four
years. It's a case that still divides many people in this
country, but at the end of his life Hiss considered vindication a
declaration by a Russian General, who controlled the KGB
archives, saying that Hiss had never been a spy. Alger Hiss, dead
tonight at the age of 92."
</blockquote>
<P>    
As for the vindication suggested by Jennings and Brokaw, both
were apparently referring to a 1992 statement from Soviet General
Volkogonov that the KGB archives contained no evidence that Hiss
had spied for the Soviet Union. But as even The New York Times
obituary on Saturday noted, "he conceded that he could not rule
out the possibility that some records have been overlooked or
destroyed."
<P>
    The New York Times story continued: "In 1993, Maria Schmidt,
a Hungarian historian doing research on the Hungarian secret
police, said she had discovered a stack of documents among the
files of the Interior Ministry in Budapest that implicated Mr.
Hiss as a communist spy."
<P>
    Finally, earlier this year the National Security Agency
released a 1945 message to Moscow from a Soviet spy in Washington
that identified a State Department official as an agent code-named 
"Ales." As the Times reported, "There was a notation by
someone at the National Security Agency suggesting Ales was
'probably Alger Hiss.'"

<FONT SIZE=+2>2)  </FONT> The November 13 CyberAlert reported that ABC's <I>World
News Tonight</I> on Tuesday, November 12 aired a story on the
Commerce Department launching an investigation of whether John
Huang raised money for the DNC while he was at Commerce and
whether he really cut off all contact with the Lippo Indonesian
conglomerate where he formerly worked.
<P>
    NBC <I>Nightly News</I> and CBS <I>Evening News</I> that night: No story. 
And the blackout has continued, a review of broadcast network
evening shows through November 16 found:
<P>
<ul>
 <LI>    The November 13 Washington Post reported the Commerce
Department investigation and that DNC Chairman Don Fowler
conceded the party failed the check the legitimacy of donors. The
Washington Times reported on page one that Huang met with Webster
Hubbell after Hubbell resigned but before he plead guilty: "At
the time of the meeting, Mr. Huang had been at the Commerce
Department for 15 days after his resignation as vice chairman of
the Indonesian-based Lippo Group. Hubbell was on the Lippo
payroll after his 1994 resignation and was negotiating with
independent counsel Kenneth Starr for testimony in the Whitewater
probe." 
</UL>
<P>
        Network stories: None.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> The November 14 Washington Post picked up the Washington
Times story on the Huang/Hubbell meeting and detailed how Huang
simultaneously worked at Commerce and raised DNC money.
</ul>
<P>
        Network stories: None.
<P>
    <ul>
<LI>A front page story in the November 15 Los Angeles Times
recounted how large donations to the DNC followed a few days after
businessmen met Huang at Commerce. Also on Friday, The Wall
Street Journal revealed that Mark Middleton, the White House aide
involved in fundraising in Taiwan with Huang, "entertained
clients or potential clients in the White House staff restaurant
after he left the government and set up his own consulting
company."
 </UL>
<P>
       Network stories: None
<P>
<UL>
    <LI> The Saturday, November 16 New York Times reported that in
an interview with the paper Clinton admitted "that he twice
discussed policy about Indonesia and China with James Riady, the
Indonesian financier, Democratic contributor and longtime friend
of Mr. Clinton who is at the center of several inquiries into the
influence of foreign money in Washington."

 On Friday The Washington Post's John Carmody reported:
"Senior presidential adviser George Stephanopoulos lunched in
Manhattan yesterday with ABC News President Roone Arledge and his
top aide, Joanna Bistany. Network sources say Stephanopoulos, who
has said he plans to leave the White House soon, is being
considered as a contributor to Sunday morning's This Week as the
program undergoes changes following David Brinkley's retirement
as moderator, and on other news programs, including Good Morning
America."

<P>
    Zelnick should know. As noticed by MRC analyst Gene Eliasen,
Zelnick had begun his story by himself falsely characterizing the

the Clinton operative, Williams set him up with some nice
softballs. Here are three of the November 6 questions:
<P>
<blockquote>
    -- "George, did the media last night and today make too much
of this magic 50 percent margin for the President, or was it
internally a big deal?"
<P>
    -- "George, recently in a New Yorker profile that I think
most would argue was very favorable about you, not only did you
mention potential plans to leave, you said, I'm paraphrasing, 'it
was time to grow up,' leading some of your detractors to say 
'what in goodness name was the senior counselor to the President
doing having not grown up, but being senior counselor to the
President.' If you can dispassionately critique your own
performance over the past four years, I'd like you to do so."
<P>
    -- "It was said of the welfare bill when it came up from the
Hill at the time that the choice for the White House was, and
this was a cynical view, either veto it as extreme or sign it and
fix it. Can you fix it?"

Washington Post editorial incorrectly argued that many NRA-backed 
candidates, such as Colorado's Wayne Allard, lost. Tuesday's Post 
ran this correction: "In the Colorado election to replace retiring Sen.
Hank Brown, Rep. Wayne Allard was the winner last Tuesday. In an
editorial Sunday we listed him incorrectly as having lost."
<P>
    A nice start, but as MediaWatch Associate Editor Tim Graham
pointed out to me the Post had also listed "Vince Snowbarger,
Kansas," as "among the other NRA favorites who lost." In fact,
Snowbarger won his House seat race 50 percent to 45 percent for
his Democratic opponent.

there is no time zone for which I am in. And sitting next to me

way to put it. And something must have sublimely set in,
grandmother reveries, or something like that, and the next thing
you know thirty minutes later I wake up and my nose is right in
the cleavage. We are not talking just leaning against, I'm just
buried in there, my little nose. It's true, it's a true story.
And one eye opened and you think 'where am I?' And then the other
eye opens and you look up and there she is, and she's absolutely
benign, like God sent me a pillow. It was beautiful, it was
beautiful."

<ol>
<li>   Discussing the GOP's performance, CBS reporter Bob Schieffer
charged that<a href="#1"> "the harshness of their rhetoric...frightened

<li>The Washington Post refuses to tell readers the <a href="#4">race of

<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>1)  </FONT> Past CyberAlerts have quoted examples of reporters
tagging Dole, Gingrich and conservatives as "harsh" and examples
of reporters stating as fact that it was the Republicans who
shut down the government, as if President Clinton had nothing to
do with it. Well, MRC analyst Steve Kaminski alerted me to a
media bias combo quote in which CBS reporter Bob Schieffer did
both. On the November 3 Sunday Morning Schieffer asserted: 
 <P>
<blockquote>   "Newt Gingrich has become sort of a logo for harsh
Republican rhetoric. I don't think there's anybody who would
tell you today that the Republicans maybe did not go a little
too far in the harshness of their rhetoric. They really
irritated a lot of people, poll after poll shows it, local
officials will tell you that, when they shut down the
government. They got the blame for that and I think in some 
ways it really kind of frightened people."

<hr width=33% align=left>
<P>
<BR>
  <FONT SIZE=+2>2) </FONT> UPN's "Star Trek: Voyager" episode last Wednesday,
November 6, revolved around the crew of the Voyager, which is
from the 24th Century, traveling back in time to 1996 Los
Angeles in order to avert the destruction of the Earth in the
29th Century. The cause of the future disaster: a Mr. Henry
Starling, played by Ed Begley Jr., who heads a computer company
ominously named ChronowerX.
<P>
    Because of a time-travel mess up Starling has obtained
technological know-how from a 29th Century spaceship. The
Voyager crew learns he's an evil businessman who became rich and
powerful by using this knowledge to create a new computer chip
in 1969 and dominate the new industry. They conclude the
"computer age of late 20th century shouldn't have happened." 
In order to keep the Voyager crew's arrival secret, businessman
Starling dispatches one of his goons to murder the astronomer
who alerted him to their arrival. 
   <P>
 Anyway, at one point the camera pans his office and full
screen for a couple of seconds is a picture on a table: a framed
photo of "Starling" shaking hands with President Richard Nixon.

<P>
<BR>
 <FONT SIZE=+2>3) </FONT> The November 10 Washington Post ran an editorial titled
"Slim Sales at the Polls for the NRA." A reliable source, a
CyberAlert recipient, urged me to check the editorial's content.
It reads in part: "Though the big campaign contributions from
the NRA flowed as usual this year, they didn't pay off the way
they once did. Some of the strongest opponents of responsible
handgun and assault weapon controls were among the losers."
Conveniently, the Post supplied a list of these losers: "Among
the NRA favorites who lost....In Senate races, Wayne Allard in
Colorado..."
<P>
    Wayne Allard, known to those outside the Post as Senator-elect 
Allard, captured 51 percent of the vote versus 46 percent for his 
Democratic opponent.            
<P>
<BR>
<a name="4">
<hr width=33% align=left>
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>4) </FONT> While we're on the Post, the November 11 Weekly
Standard observed: "The Washington Post has editorialized
against color-blind public policies, but it has embraced
colorblindness in an area where color presumably does matter --
in describing the appearance of individuals....we read in
October 26's Post of an abduction from a garage at Tysons II
Galleria mall near Washington: 'Police describe the suspect as
muscular, about 6 feet 1 inch tall and about 190 pounds, with
short dark hair and dark eyes.'...
<P>
    "In fact, the police described the suspect as muscular and
dark-skinned...so at least the warning posters at the mall said
the next day. But the police description was too politically
incorrect to be reproduced by the Post, which is evidently more
afraid of getting angry calls from black 'community leaders'
than it is interested in helping apprehend a rapist.'"
<P>    
Indeed, that's not an isolated example. The November 9 Post
carried an account of a street robbery in D.C. suffered by
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Here's the complete
description of the purse-snatcher as provided by the Post: "The
thief was a man of undetermined age who wore a white satin
jacket, police said."

<BR>
  <FONT SIZE=+2> 5)</FONT> Here are some poll numbers I never found the space to
run before the election. So, before they become antique:
<blockquote>
<P>
    -- A September poll of 1,000 registered voters for the
Freedom Forum (conducted by the Roper Center), found that most
who believe the media are biased think the media are biased to
the left: "Nearly one-third (31%) say coverage favors the
Democratic party, while 9% say coverage favors the GOP. More
than half (53%) regard coverage as balanced."
<P>
    -- Recall how the networks ignored many Clinton scandal
stories that newspapers covered? The same Freedom Forum/Roper
poll showed why that's relevant: "More than half of all voters
(56 percent) said they get most of their information about the
presidential campaign from television. An additional 30 percent
get most of their information from newspapers (17 percent),
radio (11 percent), or magazines (2 percent)." 
<P>
   -- A Pew Research Center for the People and the Press poll
released October 25 found: "A huge majority of voters (67%)
believe that among four leadership groups in the country, the
news media exerts too much influence on which candidate becomes
President, followed by business corporations (59%), labor unions
(45%) and the churches (15%)."

<FONT SIZE=+2> 6)</FONT> Friday the Late Show with David Letterman was taped at
the Warner Theater in Washington, D.C. As provided by CompuServe's 
E-Drive Forum, here's the Top Ten list for Friday, November 8:

<FONT SIZE=+2>1)  </FONT> On Friday's PBS Washington Week in Review NBC News
reporter Gwen Ifill offered her view on what the Republican
congressional leaders and Clinton will do next year: 
<P>
<blockquote>   "I don't see any of them talking about entitlement reform in
any real way other than to brand the other guy someone who's
interested in cutting your own mother off."
<P>
    Entitlement reform, as in Medicare? Where has Ifill been?
Isn't that an issue the Republican Congress tried to "reform" in
1995 only to be hammered by the media for non-existent "cuts"?

<FONT SIZE=+2> 2)</FONT> MRC analyst Steve Kaminski caught the loaded spin from
Time magazine on how Republican House members fared in Tuesday's
election. Writing the cover story for the November 18 issue that
was released last week, Michael Duffy and Nancy Gibbs asserted:
<P>
<blockquote>
    "Nearly half the casualties came from Gingrich's militant
class of 1994, who had pushed the Speaker hardest to the right
and demanded the deepest cuts in popular domestic programs in
their zeal for a balanced budget. Gone are at least six of 71
GOP freshmen, including Dan Frisa of New York, who was defeated
by Carolyn McCarthy, the widow of a victim of the Long Island
Rail Road shooting, who ran on a single-issue platform: gun
control."
</blockquote>
<P>
    I think 17 House Republicans lost by the latest count, so
really only about a third were freshmen. But let's do a little
math based upon Time's numbers. Six of 71 lost. That's 8.5
percent, meaning 91.5 percent of the House freshmen won. Quite a
repudiation of those "extremists." 
<P>
    Also among the Republicans who lost on Tuesday: Peter Blute
and Peter Torkildsen, two moderates who abandoned Gingrich on
some key votes and were gun control advocates.

<FONT SIZE=+2>3) </FONT> As mentioned in the last CyberAlert, on Thursday's
Larry King Live King said David Brinkley's election night
remarks reminded him of "wacko talk radio." Here's the complete
transcript of that November 7 exchange with guest Ted Koppel.
(Diane Rehmm is host of a 10am to noon talk show on a Washington
public radio station and her show is heard on NPR stations
around the country.)
<P>
<blockquote>
    Larry King: "How about the part where he said 'he's a bore,
always will be a bore.'? That sounds, someone called Diane
Rehm's radio show the other day, and this was the first I'd
heard of it, and I was driving along."
<P>  
 Ted Koppel: "I was listening to the same show, heard the same
call."
<P>
    King: "And it was a lady."
<P>
    Koppel: "Very nice lady."
<P>
    King: "And she was disappointed, very nice lady, a fan of
David Brinkley. She was very disappointed. And when I heard the
quote it sounded to me like it was Limbaugh or Liddy or Ollie
North. It was like wacko talk radio. It didn't sound like
Brinkley. In other words, Brinkley's always been irreverent, but
always kind of classy."
<P>
    Interesting to learn that while both King and Koppel listen
to a talk show, it's a public radio talk show.
<P>
    On Friday David Brinkley taped an interview with Bill
Clinton for airing on Sunday's This Week, his last show as host.
Brinkley, who had called Clinton "a bore" and said his election
night speech was full of "goddamn nonsense," began the
interview: "Before we begin I am reminded of something I wrote
years ago. 'It may be impossible to be objective,' I said. 'But
we must always be fair.' Well after a long day election day, and
seven hours on the set, what I said at the end of our election
night coverage was both impolite and unfair. And I'm sorry. I
regret it."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Brinkley had the class to apologize for interjecting his
opinion into a newscast. I await Bryant Gumbels's apology for 
insults against Republicans over the years.
<P>
<BR>
<a name="3">
<hr width=33% align=left>
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>4) </FONT> Reminding one of Nixonian thinking, last week Bill
Clinton promised to "cut out of American politics" his enemies. The
comment has hardly generated any media outrage. I've only seen
it on one TV show: CNN's Late Edition, and then only thanks to Bill
Bennett. On Sunday, November 10 host Frank Sesno raised it
during an interview with Bennett and Mario Cuomo:
   <blockquote>
<P>
 Frank Sesno to Mario Cuomo: "Mario Cuomo I need to ask you
about this, because amid all this hugging and this 'vital
center' and this other nonsense that we hear about that will
soon fade away as we actually get down to the reality, there is
this item that Bill Bennett actually caught in USA Today a
couple of days back that's a pick up from the Associated
Press quoting Bill Clinton as telling political supporters in
Arkansas that he 'will devote a lot of time,' I am quoting from
the paper here, 'going after detractors who pursued him on
Whitewater and other ethical questions.' He called political
attackers, quote, 'a cancer,' and vowed, quote 'to cut them out
of American politics.'"
<P>
    Cuomo: "Excuse me, that was President Clinton?"
<P>    
Sesno: "Yes. That is remarkable stuff. What do you make of
that?"
<P>
</blockquote>
    As Bennett observed, if the President were Republican such a
remark would cause "a firestorm" in the media.
<P>
<BR>
<a name="5">
<hr width=33% align=left>
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>5) </FONT> Speaking of what Sesno termed "nonsense," on the Don
Imus radio show on Thursday, November 7, NBC anchor Tom Brokaw
urged the Congress to forget doing anything conservative and
avoid investigations. Here are some of Brokaw's comments, as
transcribed by MRC intern Joe Alfonsi: 
<blockquote>
    Though voters kept the Congress in Republican hands Brokaw
saw no endorsement of the 1994 switch: 
    "I don't think it is a status quo election. I think there is
a kind of command, if you will, from the public to move to the
sensible center and let's get some things done....I don't think
that you can say that there's any ideological revolution as the
Republicans claimed two years ago nor do I think this President
can now say that he has this overwhelming mandate. I think what
people have cried out for is some return to common sense in
American politics. And I think that you see that reflected
already in Alfonse D'Amato, his evil twin, Skippy, apparently
has vacated his body and now he says we no longer need these
investigations of Bill and Hillary. I mean it's really one of
the remarkable turnarounds in contemporary politics."
   <P>
 Imus: "Isn't that really from Senator D'Amato covering his
own situation because he's got to run for reelection here in '98
and a lot of these exit polls here in New York suggest that
people well, hate him.
<P>
    Brokaw: "....I think that's what people want. I think that
they want politicians in Washington to solve the real problems
that are going on and when they make an assignment to a special
prosecutor or to the Justice Department, let them do that kind
of investigation....
   <P>
 "And you must remember, a lot of these new Republican
leaders, Trent Lott and others, have their own presidential
aspirations four years from now. They'll want to get things done
because I think that's the underlying message from the country
here - solve the problems. And yes there are some real problems
within the administration that need to be investigated, but
there are agencies and ways of doing that without tying up
Congress in these expensive hearings."
</blockquote>
<P>
<BR>
<a name="6">
<hr width=33% align=left>
<P>
<BR>
 <FONT SIZE=+2>6) </FONT> Finally, on the humorous front, here's a bit of what
Senator John Kerry told Katie Couric on Today Wednesday morning
after his re-election over Bill Weld: 
<blockquote>
   "The fact is that out of the last five Governors of
Massachusetts, four of them have been Republicans. People forget
that about Massachusetts. We are a reflection of the rest of the
country. We're fairly conservative, people want the same things
people want in the rest of the country."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Massachusetts conservative? Reflection of the country? This
the morning after Bob Dole got just 28 percent in the state. He
did worse only in Rhode Island. And, the day after the state's
two GOP House members were turned out. 
<P>
    As for Republican Governors, current Governor Weld is a 
Republican. Before him Democrat Michael Dukakis held the office 
for eight years and he succeeded Ed King, another Democrat who 
beat Dukakis in the 1978 primary. That means two of the last three 
have been Democrats.

1) A front page story in the November 7 Los Angeles Times
reported: "The Democratic National Committee said Wednesday that
it is returning one of its largest 1996 campaign contributions,
$325,000, to Yogesh K. Gandhi because it could not verify that he
was the source of the funds." On Thursday the DNC returned a
$50,000 donation to a Greek businessman. 
<BR><DD>
So how did the networks play this confirmation of the pre-election 
GOP charge that the DNC took money from foreign nationals, which 
is illegal? Not a word on the November 7 CBS Evening News or NBC 
Nightly News. Only ABC's World News Tonight covered it. Reporter 
Jackie Judd put the news at the top of her piece on Republican 
plans to investigate Clinton.
<P>
But Thursday's NBC Nightly News found time to report
D'Amato's announcement and to disparage the quest for information.
Jim Miklaszewski's story started with the news of cabinet
resignations, then moved to D'Amato. Here's the end of his
report: 
<BR><DD>
    Jim Miklaszewski: "One of the Clinton's chief antagonists in
Congress, Senator Alfonse D'Amato, announced his Whitewater probe
is over"
<br><dd>
    D'Amato: "I think if we get into this business of looking
like we're out to fish, to bring up something to embarrass the
President. I don't think that's good for the country."
<br><dd>
    Miklaszewski: "White House officials are under no illusions
and still expect Republicans to vigorously pursue investigations
on other fronts. But they're also encouraged that D'Amato's
announcement may signal an end to any high profile political
witch hunts. Jim Miklaszewski, NBC News, the White House."
<p>
When the Senate held four weeks of hearings chaired by
D'Amato in July and August 1995 NBC Nightly News ran a grand
total three stories.

<hr width=33% align=left>
2) Newsweek Washington bureau chief Evan Thomas has
discovered that Paula Jones may have some credibility. On the
November 3 Inside Washington the panel discussed the new American
Lawyer article in which reporter Stuart Taylor learned that "a
comparison of the Paula Jones and Anita Hill episodes suggests
that the evidence against the President is far stronger than the
media has let on -- and far stronger than the evidence against
[Clarence] Thomas."
<BR><DD>
On the show Evan Thomas explained: "There are two witnesses
here that matter, there are two friends of Paula Jones that she
spoke to right after the alleged incident. And they do not
generally make their story available to the press, generally.
They talked to one reporter from the [Washington] Post, Mike
Isikoff, and the Post worried about whether to do this story for
a long time, finally ran a kind of somewhat diluted version of
it, and nobody talked to these women. Now, Stuart has gone back
and talked to them and they paint a pretty bad tale."
<BR><DD>
Nina Totenberg, who first publicized Hill's unsubstantiated
an uncorroborated charges, then asserted: "There are two things
in this article: one is the examination of the evidence which is
fair game and not dramatically new but very interesting and
somewhat compelling. The other is the Anita Hill argument and I
would say that's apples and oranges. This woman is going to get
her day in court or she's going to settle, one or the other."
<P>
When the Jones story first came to light Evan took a bit
different approach. On the May 7, 1994 Inside Washington he
declared:
<br><dd>
"Yes, the case is being fomented by right-wing nuts, and yes,
she is not a very credible witness, and it's really not a law
case at all...some sleazy woman with big hair coming out of the
trailer parks...I think she's a dubious witness, I really do."
<P>
The American Lawyer article has been out for two weeks. So
what has Evan Thomas put in Newsweek. MRC analyst Steve Kaminski
reports nothing appeared in this week's or last week's issue.

3) Yesterday's CyberAlert reported how at the end of ABC's
election night broadcast David Brinkley noted the creativity of
his ABC colleagues, and then charged that "Bill Clinton has none
of it. He has not a creative bone in his body. Therefore he is a
bore and will always be a bore." I also predicted that his
remarks would become big news as the journalistic community
cringed at the anti-Clinton remarks. 
<P>
Well, Thursday's newspapers brought plenty of stories and a
remark earlier election night that didn't air on ABC's Washington
affiliate. Just after Clinton finished his speech, at about
12:30am ET, this exchange occurred, as printed in the November 7
Dallas Morning News. (Rush Limbaugh on Thursday also played a tape
of Brinkley's comments.)
<br><dd>
Brinkley: "I wish to say that we all look forward with great
pleasure to four years of wonderful, inspiring speeches full of
wit, poetry, music, love and affection. More goddamn nonsense."
<br><dd>
Peter Jennings: "You can't say that on the air, Mr. Brinkley."
<br><dd>
Brinkley: "Well, I'm not on the air."
<br><dd>
Jennings: "David, we are on the air."
<br><dd>
Brinkley: "Too bad. I told you I was leaving."
<P>
<DD>Thursday night the controversy led Larry King's CNN interview
with Ted Koppel. King called the remarks "mean-spirited," and
something he'd expect from "wacko talk radio" hosts like
Limbaugh, Oliver North or G. Gordon Liddy. [There will be more of
King's comments in the next CyberAlert.]
<br><dd>
All fall reporters regularly referred to Bob Dole as "harsh,"
but no controversy erupted. Back on the February 20 Today show
Bryant Gumbel derided Pat Buchanan as "Mr. Puke-anan." 
<br><dd>
I'm still waiting for the media consternation.

4) Here are some more quotes from election night coverage on
NBC and CBS, as collated by Steve Kaminski, Geoffrey Dickens and
Joe Alfonsi.
<ul>
<li><i>Dan Rather:</i> "How concerned is the President about the potential of his being, sort of, tied down as Gulliver was by the Lilliputians, by all this scandal investigation, ethics investigations that are bound to be unleashed?"
<li><i>Dan Rather to Senator Trent Lott:</i> "True or false, that part of the Republican agenda is now to try to paralyze the White House with so-called ethics inquiries?"
<li><i>Tom Brokaw:</i> "At one point Trent Lott was talking about unleashing some investigations of fundraising and other matters at the White House. Do you think he will pull back from that once reality sets in come January?"
<li><i>Dan Rather:</i> "The Colorado Senate race has been decided. Our CBS News estimate is the seat will remain Republican with Wayne Allard finishing with roughly 51 percent and Tom Strickland somewhat below that. The Democrats thought that Wayne Allard perhaps was, 'too far right' to succeed the retiring Republican, Senator Hank Brown. Turned out to be not the case, Allard wins it for the Republicans in Colorado."
<li><i>Up next, Rather labeled a Democrat, but not as "too far left." He used a milder tag for a Minnesota Senator:</i> "No surprises here, although Paul Wellstone, the Republicans had targeted him. They thought they had him. Frequently called the most liberal member of the United States Senate, but Wellstone has returned for a second term in Minnesota."
</ul>
<P>
Brinkley may have dumped on Clinton, but here's what NBC
viewers got after Clinton's speech:
<ul>
<li><dd><i>Maria Shriver:</i> "Tom, very emotional ending to his speech. Expressed a lot of gratitude. He said he was humbled by this victory. And I don't know if you could tell, Mrs. Clinton seemed to be brushing away some tears. A lot of hugging up on that stage. A lot of tears in this audience. A tremendous amount of emotion here this evening. A lot of young people with smiles on their face but holding each other. Certainly a night that I don't think anybody here will ever forget." <br><dd>    <i>Tom Brokaw:</i> "We're watching the two couples on stage now.  They are the icons of the baby boomer generation!" <br><dd>    <i>Maria Shriver:</i> "That's true!"  <br><dd>    <i>Tom Brokaw:</i> "Bill Clinton and Al Gore and Tipper Gore and Hillary Clinton. They're handsome families." <br><dd>    <i>Maria Shriver:</i> "They're picture perfect!" <br><dd>    <i>Tom Brokaw:</i> "Right!" 
<li><i>Brokaw after 1am ET:</i> "That's 30 Rockefeller Plaza overlooking the ice-skating rink and if Bill Clinton were here tonight he'd be down there skating to his heart's delight obviously because he's been re-elected President of the United States." 
<li><i>Brokaw:</i> "We're back. Thirty Rockefeller Plaza there. I half expect to see Jimmy Cagney singing 'Yankee Doodle Dandy,' and dancing between those flags."
<li><i>Brokaw:</i> "Brian Williams, I have a question. You've been covering the Clinton White House for some time. Do you think that there is any more heroic figure, however not very visible, than Bob Rubin, who is the Treasury Secretary?"
</ul>

5) On Wednesday night's Late Show with David Letterman
actress Marisa Tomei appeared. Here's part of the interview:
<br><dd>
Letterman: "Did you vote yesterday?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: "Yes."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "Are you happy with the outcome?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: "Yeah. I'm very happy."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "Have you ever met President Clinton?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: "Yes I have."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "Where'd you meet him? At the White House?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: "Yeah. I met him at the White House."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "What was that like?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: "It was very sexy, actually. It is that whole feeling."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "Sexy in what sense? You're not talking about the President?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: "Well, it's a round room, first of all, the Oval Office."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "He's an enormous guy, isn't he?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: [taken aback, assuming a reference to Clinton's penis size]
"I don't know. [pause] I'm sure. It's why I voted for him."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "I mean he's fat, is what I was driving at."
<br><dd>
Tomei: "Oooh."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "He is fat."
<br><dd>
Tomei: "I don't think so."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "He is fat and I'm going to continue to say so."
<br><dd>
Tomei: "No, he's healthy. He's healthy."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "No, they say, you know they released his medical
records like about a month ago to show that he was okay, he can 
run for another four years. And I'm telling you they fudged,
because they said he's 215 [Letterman laughs]. Two-fifteen is
when lunch ends for this guy."
<p>
The gender gap solved. All Bob Dole had to do was meet women in a "round room."

"Going into the homestretch, the campaign is taking on faint overtones 
of the old protection racket with Republicans increasingly sounding like 
the Capone gang, offering protection against Bugsy Clinton and his mob." 
-- ABC's John Cochran on House GOP strategy, October 27 <i>This Week</i> 
introductory story.

<blockquote>
"The government reports today that the economy slowed down over the 
summer. The Gross Domestic Product, which measures all economic 
activity, was up 2.2 percent, but that is less than half the 4.7 
percent growth in the second quarter. President Clinton who was 
campaigning in Michigan noted that many economists say a cooling 
off is necessary to keep inflation down and therefore, he thinks, 
the numbers were good news. Senator Dole on the other hand was in 
Tennessee earlier today, along with Mrs. Dole. He says the numbers 
are cause for concern. He went on to say if Mr. Clinton is re-elected 
there could be a recession." -- ABC anchor Peter Jennings, October 30 
<i>World News Tonight</i>.
<P>
<center><b>vs.</b></center>
<P>
Peter Jennings: "The [2.7 percent GDP] rate is more than economists 
had projected, but in many cases, less than meets the eye." 
Bob Jamieson: "The increase in economic growth was driven by a surge 
in consumer spending. The best news came from spending for big 
appliances and furniture, which rose by nearly nine percent. But 
many economists say the report is not proof the economy is taking 
a sharp turn for the better." -- <i>World News Tonight</i>, October 27, 1992.
<P>
"The government is out with its final official report on economic 
growth before the election. And it indicates a dramatic slowdown. 
In the third quarter of the year the U.S. economy grew at an annual 
rate of just 2.2 percent, that is less than half the growth rate of 
the second quarter. It didn't take long for the presidential candidates 
to put their own spins on today's economic numbers." -- Dan Rather, 
Oct. 30 CBS <i>Evening News</i>.

"Just one week before the election and the Bush administration says
the U.S. economy has turned the corner and started expanding again,
but there is some doubt about the accuracy of the figures, and even 
if they are accurate, they may be too little too late to help 
President Bush because it was also announced today that consumer 
confidence in the economy continues to fall." -- Rather on the 
October 27, 1992 CBS <i>Evening News</i>. The GDP figure was later 
revised upward to 3.9 percent for the 3rd quarter.
<P>
"The economy was slow, but steady going in the last quarter. Many 
economists were encouraged by that because it means inflation is 
under control and interest rates will stay low. But, Bob Dole has 
another vision." -- Tom Brokaw, October 30 NBC <i>Nightly News.</i>

"To take back the House of Representatives the Democrats need 19 seats.
And as of today it looks like they could win them. Democrats are taking 
special aim at the Republicans elected in 1994. They're endangered in 
part because their leader is so unpopular. With the help of millions
of dollars from organized labor, Democratic challengers constantly remind
voters that these freshmen supported Newt Gingrich and that together they 
shut down the government." -- ABC's Cokie Roberts, October 18 <i>World

<blockquote>
"Dole knows better. Columnist Matthew Miller has even fancifully suggested 
that the Senator's 15 percent tax cut proposal is really part of a secret 
Dole plan to have radical tax-cutting decisively repudiated at the polls. 
That way, the death of his political career can give life to the principle 
of fiscal responsibility that he devoted so many years of that career to 
advancing. If only." -- Newsweek's Jonathan Alter, Oct. 21.
<P>
"One of the roles of a journalist is to afflict the comfortable and 
comfort the afflicted. But after the debate ended, not one network news 
anchor or commentator noted the oddness of two presidential candidates 
hankering for tax handouts. Like Clinton and Dole, the anchors and 
television pundits earn more than 99 percent of all Americans. If 
those same TV commentators made say, $35,000 a year, they might 
have been more struck by Dole and Clinton's bantering." -- U.S. 
News Senior Writer David Whitman, October 21.
<P>
"By 1985, Reagan's economics had plunged the country into debt. 
Dole's all-out fight to lower the deficit became the defining battle 
of his career." -- Actress Blair Brown narrating <i>Frontline</i> on PBS, 
October 8.
<P>
"Just a year later, when he saw that supply-side economics had 
ballooned the deficit, Dole worked hard to raise government revenues 
by closing tax loopholes, and pushing through what was then the 
argest tax increase in history." -- Ken Bode narrating "Bob 
Dole's Odyssey" in CNN's <i>Democracy in America</i>, Oct 20.

<blockquote>
"Bob Dole is running around the country saying, `Where is the 
utrage?' Where is it? We now have the Democratic Party hiding 
this guy John Huang until after the election, who was out raising 
money. You've got rafts of big contributors all listing the same 
address, which is the Democratic national headquarters. Newsweek 
says you have the ambassador to Taiwan out there soliciting huge 
gifts from people, businessmen in Taiwan and you have Buddhist 
monks and nuns who have taken vows of poverty giving big amounts 
of money to the Democratic Party, and nobody seems to notice this. 
Somebody said the other day if the Republicans had done this the 
press would be killing them. Why are they getting away with this?"

<FONT SIZE=+2> 1)</FONT>   On <I>This Morning</I> on Wednesday, November 6, CBS reporter Troy Roberts began a story: 
<blockquote>
"The pundits had written his political obituary, but last night Newt Gingrich oversaw a
victory, just barely, as voters ratified the two-year-old
revolution that changed the face of Congress. The party retains
control of the House, despite discouraging poll figures about
its leader..."
</blockquote>
<P>
    That view, of the vote ratifying the GOP win in 1994, was
rarely heard on the networks. In fact, no story on the Wednesday
night ABC, CBS or NBC evening shows told viewers that almost all
of the "extremist" freshmen won.
   <P>
 Among the winners, Helen Chenoweth of Idaho. Back on the
October 12 <I>Capital Gang</I>, The Wall Street Journal's Al Hunt
predicted: "I think the Gingrich robots are going to pay a
price. I mean Helen Chenoweth, the militia momma, is toast.
She's gone. Absolutely."
<P>
    Then followed this exchange:
<blockquote>
    Mark Shields: "Helen Chenoweth better start working on her
concession speech."<P>

 Early in the evening, all the networks falsely reported
that Senator Bob Smith would lose in New Hampshire. CBS provided
an explanation for the Republican loss. Bob Schieffer explained:  
 <P>
 <blockquote>  "I think that most Republicans considered Bob Smith, the New
Hampshire incumbent, perhaps, one of their most vulnerable
incumbents. This is a very interesting case Dan, he's a very
conservative Senator in a state that's becoming more moderate.
Most people on the national scene will recall him as the one
that fought against abortion over the past 3 or 4 years and
always brought all those graphic photos out to the Senate floor.
But in our polling, our exit polling today we found that the
moderate voters, 61 percent of them said that they voted for
Dick Swett. This is a state that is simply becoming more
moderate. When we ran this poll I think that almost half of the
people in New Hampshire told us that they now consider
themselves moderate. This used to be a very conservative state
but it got too moderate, I guess, for Bob Smith." 
</blockquote>
    In the end he wasn't too conservative for a newly moderate
state as he won re-election.

<FONT SIZE=+2> 3)</FONT>
 Speaking of labeling, the networks provided plenty of it
Tuesday night. Senator Paul Wellstone got tagged "liberal" a few
times, but Republicans were described as conservative or "very"
conservative more often, especially on CNN. Some examples:
<P>
<blockquote>
    -- Peter Jennings on ABC: "And the other thing which would
be quite a change, at least in ideological terms, is the
projection you made for Brownback in Kansas. Much more
conservative than the Republicans that Kansas usually sends to
Washington."
<P>
    -- Bob Schieffer on CBS, reporting the Georgia Senate race:
"Max Cleland, the Secretary of State and triple amputee down
there, the most popular vote getter. He even gets more votes
than Sam Nunn over the last 10 years was running against Guy
Millner a very conservative Republican." 
<P>
    -- Bruce Morton on CNN: "And finally Louisiana. That's
Bennett Johnston's old seat, where the Democrat Mary Landrieu is
in a very, very competitive race with a very, very conservative,
but there're a lot of those folks in Louisiana, state
Representative named Woody Jenkins."
<P>
    -- Frank Sesno on CNN: "Onto Illinois now, where Dick Durbin
turns back a challenge from Al Salvi, a very conservative
Republican there, but Dick Durbin winning there."
<P>
    -- Sesno again: "This seat was the one that was vacated when
Robert Dole took his leave to campaign for presidency. Jill
Docking the Democrat against Sam Brownback, very conservative
Republican."
<P>
    -- Morton again: "Still up in the air, Louisiana, where very
conservative Woody Jenkins won that odd, everybody-in primary
that they have."
<P>
    -- Exchange on CNN. Frank Sesno: "Helms ran a series of
really tough ads hitting his opponent Harvey Gantt,
African-American, with liberal liberal liberal label again."
    Bruce Morton: "Well the famous line I guess, more liberal
than Bill Clinton. Gasp! Shudder! Too liberal for North
Carolina. Helms always runs mean ads. I talked to one man down
there who were saying if he was running against Jesus he'd find
a way to attack him."
<P>
    -- Ken Bode on CNN: "That was a very clear choice for the
voters of Louisiana. Mary Landrieu is a moderate at least,
probably a liberal. And the person she was running against,
Woody Jenkins, a state legislator so conservative that in
twenty-some years, twenty-some years in the state legislature,
he did not vote for a single tax increase."
<P>
</blockquote>
    As 1am ET approached, CNN anchor Bernard Shaw assured
viewers: "A lot of Democrats have criticized us in our coverage
and conversely a lot of Republicans have criticized us in our
coverage. Never once in our coverage of this campaign story have
we played favorites. We don't play favorites."

 In speculating about what factors led to Clinton's
comeback, reporters repeatedly committed the biased reporting
that aided Clinton's cause: stating as fact that the GOP shut
down the government without mentioning how Clinton refused to
sign the spending resolutions. Some examples:
<blockquote>
<P>
    -- Bernard Shaw on CNN: "Ken Bode making the point about,
and you Judy, that the President made this comeback, especially
after the disaster of 1994. The Republican Party actually helped
William Jefferson Clinton in that comeback, especially when they
voted to shut down Congress. The American people said the
Republicans went too far. We did not sent you to Washington to
shut down the federal government."
<P>
    -- Sam Donaldson on ABC on why Dole lost: "I think this was
set by two or three people. I think Alan Greenspan, who is the
Fed Chairman, helped engineer an economy that worked and it
worked for President Clinton. I think the Speaker of the House
Newt Gingrich helped engineer a shutdown of the Congress twice,
that scared the country and that worked against Senator Dole, it
wasn't Senator Dole's fault...."
<P>
    -- Troy Roberts on Wednesday's <I>This Morning</I> on CBS: "Often
abrasive, Gingrich never mastered the fine art of compromise. 
Less than a year after he rode into Washington in triumph, he
was on the defensive. His gambit to shut down the government
over the budget backfired. Seizing the moment, President Clinton
quickly became the voice of centrist reason."

scandals. So warned several network reporters. Some examples:

    -- NBC's Tom Brokaw in prime time: "There is also a theory,
however, that if the Republicans begin to engage once again in a
lot of investigations that it will not do well for them four
years from now. Because the country in all the exit polling that
we're seeing so far is saying, 'Hey let's get on with the
business of solving the real problems that we have out there.'"
<P>
    -- NBC's Matt Lauer to Haley Barbour, on the Wednesday,
November 6 <I>Today</I>: "Mr. Barbour, exit polls show us that the
economy was still the number one issue on people's mind last
night. And although character and trust play a role, people
choose candidates based on their handling of the issues. With
that in mind, what do you say to people now who look to
Republicans in Congress and say, hey, move forward on key
legislation. Don't get bogged down on investigations into the
Clinton White House?"
<P>
    -- ABC's John Cochran concluding his November 6 <I>World News
Tonight</I> story on the new Congress: "But both parties know the
public has a limited appetite for partisan head-bashing. And
today Senate Republicans said they had no plans to resume
investigations of the Whitewater affair. John Cochran, ABC News,
Capitol Hill."

    None too pleased with the passage of a proposition in
California to end racial discrimination, reporters tagged the
vote a step backward. Examples:
<P>
<blockquote>
    -- NBC's Maria Shriver to Jesse Jackson at about 12:48am ET:
"Affirmative action was a hotbed issue in this country, still a
big race on that subject going on about that in California. Did
you feel at times like we've turned back the clock on some of
these issues?"
<P>
    -- On Wednesday's <I>This Morning</I> co-host Jane Robelot
interviewed California Civil Rights Initiative chief Ward
Connerly:
<P> 
<blockquote>
"Good morning Mr. Connerly. Do you feel like Prop. 209
is going to stand up to the promised court challenges that it
faces?"
<P>
    Ward Connerly: "Absolutely, I think if you read the first
five words of the initiative, which say that the states shall
not discriminate. And by state I mean all governmental agencies
in the state. You recognize that it is already existing law and
the remainder of that first clause,  nor grant preferential
treatment to' and so on is really saying that discrimination
encompasses preferential treatment."
    Robelot: "But that's sort of living in an ideal world I mean
it's nice to say it on paper. If you look around at corporate
offices in America and in CEO's offices, you're gonna see very
few minorities and few women. Are we really ready to backtrack
on civil rights now, or on affirmative action?"

     Another election night, another night of wacky comments
from Dan Rather, aka Ratherisms:
<blockquote>
<P>
    -- "Phil Jones is at the Dole HQ in Washington. Phil if you
are a Republican and you're a Bob Dole supporter, seeing New
Hampshire and Florida both fall into the column for Bill
Clinton, is it scary enough to make you swallow your gum?"
<P>
    -- "In Kentucky, in the presidential race, this is the way
it looks. This is with 47 percent of the precincts reporting.
Bill Clinton leading Bob Dole by just about the margin of
cigarette paper."
<P>
   -- "Our CBS news estimates is in one of the nastiest, 
smelliest campaigns of them all -- a lot of people
thought the stench from this would gag a buzzard -- Jeff
Sessions, the Alabama Attorney General, has beaten back the
effort of state senator Roger Bedford, to fill the seat of
retiring Democratic Senator Howell Heflin." 
<P>
    -- "Now, we may see Michael Jackson's baby before we know
the final outcome of this race for the House of Representatives
tonight..."
<P>
    -- In New Hampshire, closest Senate race in the country,
this race between Dick Swett and Bob Smith is hot and tight as a
too small bathing suit on a too long car ride back from the
beach."
<P>
    -- "Reelection of President Bill Clinton is as secure as a
double knot tied with wet rawhide and here's why..." 
<P>
    -- NBC's Tom Brokaw got into the act, offering this
Brokawism: "Just one state now closing its polls at this hour.
It's the home state of the incumbent President of the United
States, the state of Arkansas. No surprise, Bill Clinton now our
projected winner there. For him to lose Arkansas would be like
Elvis losing his hair. He could go on but it just wouldn't be
the same somehow."

     Networks reporters regularly referred to Bob Dole's
"harsh" rhetoric and media professional didn't complain. But in
Thursday's newspapers you may be reading about a critical
comment about Clinton that David Brinkley uttered. At the very
end of ABC's broadcast, just before 1am ET, Sam Donaldson, Cokie
Roberts, Jeff Greenfield, Lynn Sherr, and Hal Bruno stood by the
anchor desk where Peter Jennings and Brinkley sat. 
   <P>
 Jennings asked Brinkley for a final comment. Referring to
the assembled ABC crew, Brinkley announced: "OK, fine, I'm not
going to say much. Among things I admire, almost near the top is
creativeness, and everyone in this group has it. It shows in
your work, it shows in your thinking, and it shows in your
speech, what you do, what you write, what you say, and it's one
reason this group is so terrific. Bill Clinton has none of it,
he has not a creative bone in his body. Therefore, he's a bore
and will always be a bore."
<P>
<BR>
<a name="ninth">
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>  9)</FONT>
     Finally, Wednesday's NBC <I>Nightly News</I> concluded with a
piece from Mike Boettcher on what people want in second term.
Boettcher began: 
<P>
<blockquote>
    "When the sun touched the Pacific, America had made a
decision. Bob Dole's work was over. Bill Clinton's had just
begun. There, in a California night school was the gender gap.
The all-woman sign language class wanted their support for
Clinton rewarded."
  <P>
  Woman in the class: "I want to see a President that stands
for what he believes in and not somebody who just wants to
please the people."
<P>
</blockquote>
    So, someone who doesn't want a President who molds his views
to match polls voted for......Clinton. 
<P>Incredible.

<FONT SIZE=+2> 1)</FONT> If you say something less than glowing about President
Clinton, then you are "harsh." On Monday (November 4) night's
World News Tonight, ABC anchor Peter Jennings told viewers:
<blockquote>    "Some of the harshest language about the President, again
today coming from Ross Perot. Mr. Perot made only one public
appearance today, in his home state of Texas."
</blockquote>
<P>
    And here's Perot's harsh comment: "Would you allow a man with
pending criminal charges to babysit your children? It's a joke.
You wouldn't think about it."

<FONT SIZE=+2>2) </FONT> In a short World News Tonight segment Monday night Sam Donaldson explained some of the changes in committee
chairmanships that would happen if Democrats take control of the
upper chamber. But only one Senator got an extremist tag:
<blockquote>    "At the Armed Services Committee, you'll find Carl Levin, far
less user friendly to the armed services, would be the chairman.
In Foreign Relations, Jesse Helms, the arch-conservative would no
longer be there. And in Labor and Foreign Relations, Ted Kennedy
would chair once again. If the President wants to try for health
care reform once more, he'd have a friendly committee there."

    Yes, he said "Labor and Foreign Relations" when he meant
Labor and Human Resources.

     <FONT SIZE=+2>3)</FONT> MRC analyst Steve Kaminski caught CBS reporter Bill
Plante adopting liberal spin as fact on Monday's This Morning.
Looking back at the 1996 campaign, Plante asserted at one point: 
   <blockquote> "You think the campaign began here, at the Democrats' made
for TV convention? No way. It really began with this year's State
of the Union address. The President already knew he'd have no
opponent in New Hampshire and the Republicans had just stumbled
badly by shutting down the government."

<BR>
    <FONT SIZE=+2>4) </FONT> On Saturday's Capital Gang on CNN both Margaret Carlson of Time and Al Hunt of the Wall Street Journal put their liberal
hearts ahead of their political brains. 
<P>
   Margaret Carlson offered this prediction on the House races,
as transcribed by MRC intern Joe Alfonsi: "Some of the Democrats
are going to suffer from the down draft from Clinton and the
money. Some of these freshman are going to go and that's great
relief. Helen Chenoweth, her evil twin, Andrea Seastrand in
California, J.D. Hayworth, Steve Stockman, the painter from
Texas." 
<P>
   National Review's Kate O'Beirne jumped in: "More women in
Congress Margaret, what's wrong with you?" Carlson countered:
"You have to reach a certain level of competence."
<P>
    O'Beirne then predicted the GOP would hold the House. Al Hunt
agreed, but: "All the reporting that I've done, suggests that
Kate is absolutely right and I think over 90 percent of the
incumbents are going to be re-elected because it's a good year
for incumbents. But my gut tells me that two dozen of those
Gingrich robots, the freshmen, are going to bite the dust and the
Democrats are going to pick up 25 seats. Mark I'm not sure I
believe it, but it's my prediction and I'm sticking with it."
<P>
    We'll soon know if Hunt's dream of a Democratic House will
come true.

<BR>
   <FONT SIZE=+2>  5) </FONT>Why are Generation Xers (those in their 20s) turned off
by Campaign '96? Here's the explanation of Tabitha Soren from MTV
as espoused on Monday's This Morning: 
   <blockquote> "This year you have two known quantities so young people feel
like they are dealing with people who are political insiders and
that generally turns younger people off. They really feel, our
polls show, that they are disinterested and even the people who
are voting are not really happy with their choices. They feel
like they're sort of choosing between which Menendez brother do
they like better. So, a lot of them also say they'd love to turn
to a third party if they thought they could win. But I think
that's keeping a lot of people away from the process."
</blockquote>
<P>
<BR>
    Between watching all the election night coverage and going to
an election night party, I probably won't have time to do a
CyberAlert for Wednesday morning, so expect the next CyberAlert
Wednesday night/Thursday morning.

<h3>Four items today:</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>NPR's Mara Liasson predicts that <a href="#second">in a second term Bill Clinton will propose many new government programs,</a> but that doesn't make him a liberal.
<li><a href="#donaldson">Sam Donaldson</a> says Republicans shut the government down and asserts: "I don't think this was a Republican conservative tide in 1994."
<li>Among the DNC donors listed in the report the Democrats initially refused to release: <a href="#celebs">Hollywood celebrities from Robert Zemeckis to Danny DeVito.</a>
<li>A TV <a href="#host">network host admits supporting George McGovern</a> -- when she was seven years old.
</ol>
<a name="second">
1) A lot of little government programs add up to big government
and putting mandates on business is the latest way liberals have found
to impose their views, but that's escaped NPR's Mara Liasson. On
Washington Week in Review Friday night on PBS (November 1) Liasson
assured viewers that Republican are wrong to tag Clinton a liberal:
<br><dd>
"There's this myth that if Clinton does get the Democrats back in
control [of Congress], he'll revert to the quote 'old Bill Clinton.' The 
Republicans would like you to believe he'll become a liberal again. 
I don't think that's going to happen. I think the White House has 
prepared a second term agenda that is geared with either a razor-thin 
Democratic majority in mind, or Republicans still in control. They are 
going to be able to get the same program through no matter what. And 
it's going to be these small, incremental things, teeny tiny proposals 
that he's made this year, nothing big, no big government programs."
<P>
<a name="donaldson">
2) Republicans and conservatives may gain House and Senate seats 
on Tuesday and Bill Clinton is winning by stealing conservative issues
and claiming credit for the accomplishments of Congress, but Sam Donaldson
doesn't think the country has moved right.
<P>
In the roundtable portion of Sunday's This Week with David Brinkley
Sam Donaldson went so far from reality that even Cokie Roberts felt 
compelled to correct him:
<br><dd>
    Sam Donaldson: "George is always seeing a conservative tide. If 
three county commissioners are elected in an off season and they 
happen to be Republican conservative, you say there's a Republican 
conservative tide. I don't think this was a Republican conservative tide 
in 1994."
<br><dd>
Cokie Roberts: "How come only Democratic incumbents lost and no 
Republican incumbents lost?"
<br><dd>
Donaldson: "Because I think it was the voters saying throw the 
bums out."
<br><dd>
Roberts: "But no Republican incumbents lost."
<br><dd>
Donaldson: "But I'm taking about conservative tide. There was an 
anti-Democratic tide, absolutely, Cokie. They said throw these Democrtaic 
bums out they've had all these years in Congress and we don't like it 
and we don't like our lives and they're in."
<br><dd>George Will: "Speaking for conservatives, let's just say 1994 is 
alright with us no matter what you call it."
<br><dd>Donaldson: "Are you going to shut down the government again, did 
that strategy work?"
<P>
<a name="celebs">
3) At a campaign rally in New Jersey on Sunday, actress
Whoopi Goldberg introduced the President. While she's on the
road for the campaign, her friends in Hollywood have been writing
some large checks. When the Democratic National Committee last 
week released a donor list they initially withheld, the Washington
Times checked to see who was among those making the $10.1 million
in donations that arrived in early October. Among the names:
<ul>
<li>TV producer Norman Lear: $80,000
<li>Movie director Robert Zemeckis: $50,000
<li>Actor Robin Williams and wife Marsha: $30,000
<li>Eagles singer Don Henley: $30,000
<li>Actor Danny DeVito: $5,000
<li>Movie Director Rob Reiner: $5,000
<li>Former 20th Century Fox owner Marvin Davis: $5,000
</ul>
Meanwhile, the October 31 Washington Post had this item
in a "day in the life" story on the campaigns:
<br><dd>
"3pm, Washington. Kevin Spacey, the movie actor is touring the
Clinton-Gore headquarters....The entire Clinton-Gore Washington
operation screeches to a halt. Eventually they get Spacey to
participate in a daily campaign ritual. The staffers have taped
a sheet a butcher paper to a door. On the paper, in crayon, somebody
has drawn the White House and the number seven -- as in seven
more days and it's over. As the Olympic fanfare blares from a
boombox, and the staffers cheer him on, Spacey jumps through the
paper like Superman."
<P>
<a name="host">
4) Opening the Saturday Today show on November 2, co-host
Jodi Applegate promoted an upcoming segment. In so doing she
showed that members of the media don't grow liberal with age, 
they start out that way.
<BR><DD>
Jodi Applegate: "Did you hear about the Weekly Reader poll 
that was out this week?"
<BR><DD>
Jack Ford: "Did you used to get them in school? I loved them."
<BR><DD>
Applegate: "Oh yeah. In 1972 I voted for McGovern, because  
'govern' was in his name. This was my thinking when I was seven 
years old. Anyway, they're uncannily accurate at predicting the 
outcome of the presidential campaign so we'll take a look at why 
that might be."
<P>
How much do you want to bet that she's voting for Clinton this 
year because she thinks the C in Clinton stands for "compassion"?

<h3>Five items today:</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>The <a href="#huang">revelation of John Huang's frequent white house visits</a> led Thursday's Good Morning America, but were not mentioned at all on Today or This Morning.
<li>Wednesday's <a href="#nbc">NBC Nightly News</a> did not include a word about Huang, but ABC and CBS did air stories on him.
<li>ABC's Jeff Greenfield explores <a href="#bias">whether liberal bias may explain</a> why scandals don't hurt Clinton.

<li>The November 4 edition of the MRC's <a href="#nq">Notable Quotables.</a> 
</ol>
<a name="huang">
1) <b>"DNC Fundraiser Huang Visited White House Often: Log Shows 
Him There 78 Times Since July '95"</b> declared the front page story 
in the Thursday, October 31 <i>Washington Post</i>. The <i>Washington Times</i> 
headline read: <b>"Huang Frequent White House Visitor: Also Got Unusual 
Security Clearance Waiver."</b>
<BR><DD>
So, did these headlines prompt stories on the network morning 
shows? MRC analysts Steve Kaminski and Jim Forbes told me not on CBS 
This Morning or NBC's Today. Only GMA, MRC analyst Gene Eliasen observed, 
didn't ignore the news. GMA co-host Charlie Gibson opened the show:
<BR><DD>
"The lead story involves campaign fundraising. More fuel on the 
fire of that story that has been catching heat in the latter days of 
the campaign. John Huang, the fellow who was at the center of that 
Indonesian fundraising connection for the Democrats. The people in 
the administration have been downplaying his importance, but now 
there is word he made more than sixty visits to the White House in 
the first part of this year, those visits ending right away when 
those stories about Indonesian fundraising broke, and we'll have 
that in our newscasts throughout the morning."
<P>
Tuesday morning on Good Morning America Gibson had wondered 
why there wasn't more coverage of questions about Democratic 
fundraising, suggesting that "if Republicans had done this the 
press would be killing them." (See last quote in Notable Quotables 
below.) The question remains for the other networks, but Thursday 
morning Gibson's reporting addressed his concerns.
<P>
<a name="nbc">
2) Thursday night NBC Nightly News failed to mention John 
Huang's name. Introducing a story on the Clinton campaign, Tom 
Brokaw announced: "For his part, President Clinton is attempting 
to cool off the controversies over his campaign contributions. 
NBC's Brian Williams is in California tonight ahead of the 
President's trip there."
<P>
But that was it. Williams said nothing about fundraising, 
instead reporting that "in Las Vegas he [Clinton] hit Dole on the 
tax cut plan. He reminded the audience about Dole's role, along 
with Gingrich, in shutting the government down during the winter."
<P>
Next, NBC aired a story from Lisa Myers on what will happen if 
Democrats win Congress. She began by noting that Dick Gephardt says 
"Democrats are more moderate than two years ago." She reported that 
"long time liberals who claim to have signed on to the new centrist 
agenda" would get the committee chairmanships. But she compared that 
to reality, asking Congressman Charles Rangel: "Are you committed 
to balancing the budget in six years?" Rangel shot back: "No."
<P>
On World News Tonight, Jackie Judd explored the latest on the 
John Huang front, noting the Republicans have asked if donors 
"were front men to donate money that came from illegal sources, 
and did large contributions influence foreign policy."
<P>
On the CBS Evening News Thursday, Dan Rather stated: "President 
Clinton's strategy to deal with the pre-election attacks is keep 
moving, change the subject and have aides handle damage control.
Case in point: Questions about John Huang, the Democratic fundraiser 
with easy access to heavy money interests in Asia. It now turns out 
Huang also had much easier access to the White House itself than was
previously disclosed."
<P>
Later in the show in a "Follow the Dollar" segment, a week after 
ABC did it, Linda Douglass examined John Huang's trail.
<P>
<a name="bias">
3) World News Tonight looked at why scandals don't damage 
Clinton and gave airtime to the liberal bias explanation. Peter 
Jennings introduced the October 31 story: "We have one additional 
report tonight on these many questions about the behavior, and in 
some cases the alleged behavior, of Mr. and Mrs. Clinton during 
these last few years. ABC's Jeff Greenfield tonight on what sticks 
and what doesn't and what may stick around."
<P>
<DD>Here's the end of Greenfield's piece:
<BR>
<DD>"Among Republicans, one of the most popular explanations for 
Clinton's invulnerability is a liberal media bias. And at least one 
journalist thinks the critics may have a point. A forthcoming article
in The American Lawyer magazine argues that Paula Jones' charges of 
sexual harassment against then-Governor Clinton are far more credible 
than those of Anita Hill against Judge Clarence Thomas. But the 
article's author says the Paula Jones case has been covered very 
differently."
<BR>
<DD>Stuart Taylor, The American Lawyer magazine: "Imagine if Paula Jones 
or someone just like her made allegations, just like this, with evidence
just like this, against Jesse Helms or Newt Gingrich."
Greenfield: "If the polls are right all these charges will have very
little impact on the election. But once the political season ends, they 
could cast giant cloud over a second Clinton term."
<P>
Indeed, though the American Lawyer piece has been out for a week,
as far as I know this is the first network mention.
<P>
<a name="cnn">
4) Five days before Americans vote CNN carried live coverage of 
TV talk show host Jenny Jones testifying in a Michigan murder trial 
instead of their daily politics show. CNN stayed with her past 4pm ET, 
the time for Inside Politics. She stepped down at about 4:20 and CNN 
carried Inside Politics a half hour late at 4:30pm.

introductory story.</i>
<P>
<b>The Bad News is Really Good, Good News Really Not</b>
<BR>
<DD>"The government reports today that the economy slowed down over the 
summer. The Gross Domestic Product, which measures all economic 
activity, was up 2.2 percent, but that is less than half the 4.7 
percent growth in the second quarter. President Clinton who was 
campaigning in Michigan noted that many economists say a cooling 
off is necessary to keep inflation down and therefore, he thinks, 
the numbers were good news. Senator Dole on the other hand was in 
Tennessee earlier today, along with Mrs. Dole. He says the numbers 
are cause for concern. He went on to say if Mr. Clinton is re-elected 
there could be a recession."<i> -- ABC anchor Peter Jennings, October 30 
World News Tonight.</i>
<center><b>vs.</b></center>
<DD><i>Peter Jennings:</i> "The [2.7 percent GDP] rate is more than economists 
had projected, but in many cases, less than meets the eye." 
<i>Bob Jamieson: </i>"The increase in economic growth was driven by a surge 
in consumer spending. The best news came from spending for big 
appliances and furniture, which rose by nearly nine percent. But 
many economists say the report is not proof the economy is taking 
a sharp turn for the better." <i>-- World News Tonight, October 27, 1992.</i>
<P>
<DD>"The government is out with its final official report on economic 
growth before the election. And it indicates a dramatic slowdown. 
In the third quarter of the year the U.S. economy grew at an annual 
rate of just 2.2 percent, that is less than half the growth rate of 
the second quarter. It didn't take long for the presidential candidates 
to put their own spins on today's economic numbers." <i>-- Dan Rather, 
Oct. 30 CBS Evening News.</i>
<center><b>vs.</b></center>
<DD>"Just one week before the election and the Bush administration says
the U.S. economy has turned the corner and started expanding again,
but there is some doubt about the accuracy of the figures, and even 
if they are accurate, they may be too little too late to help 
President Bush because it was also announced today that consumer 
confidence in the economy continues to fall." <i>-- Rather on the 
October 27, 1992 CBS Evening News.</i> The GDP figure was later 
revised upward to 3.9 percent for the 3rd quarter.
<P>
<DD>"The economy was slow, but steady going in the last quarter. Many 
economists were encouraged by that because it means inflation is 
under control and interest rates will stay low. But, Bob Dole has 
another vision." <i>-- Tom Brokaw, October 30 NBC Nightly News.</i>
<b>vs.</b>
<DD>"The President [Bush] tonight finally has an economic number that he 
can brag about, but at the same time consumers were checking in today 
and they're yet to be persuaded that this economy is turning around." 
<i>-- Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News, October 27, 1992.</i>
<P>
<b>Relaying Democratic Spin as Fact</b>
<BR>
<DD>"To take back the House of Representatives the Democrats need 19 seats.
And as of today it looks like they could win them. Democrats are taking 
special aim at the Republicans elected in 1994. They're endangered in 
part because their leader is so unpopular. With the help of millions
of dollars from organized labor, Democratic challengers constantly remind
voters that these freshmen supported Newt Gingrich and that together they 
shut down the government." <i>-- ABC's Cokie Roberts, October 18 World 
News Tonight.</i>
<P>
<b>Cheap Shot</b>
<BR>
<DD>"Which word are we talking about? The word to his first wife when he said, 
`Until death do us part?'" <i>-- CNN Talk Back Live host Susan Rook after the 
RNC's Ed Gillespie said Dole's "word is his bond." Quoted by Washington 
Post media reporter Howard Kurtz, October 21.</i>
<P>
<b>NBC: No Big Deal, Republicans Just as Bad</b>
<BR>
<DD>"Perot barely mentioned Republican Bob Dole, even though he also accepts 
contributions from overseas." <i>-- Gwen Ifill on Perot's speech criticizing 
Clinton's illegal foreign donations, Oct. 24 NBC Nightly News.</i>
<P>
<DD>"In a year when you talk about, corporations who give $25,000 chunks of 
money, why are people particularly outraged when people with last names 
like Cabrera and people from India and Korea and Indonesia and China 
all of a sudden get, there just seems to be a lot of foreigner bashing 
as a subtext in some of the criticism." <i>-- NBC News reporter Gwen Ifill 
on PBS's Washington Week in Review, October 25. Cabrera is now serving
 a 19-year sentence for smuggling 6,000 pounds of cocaine into the U.S.</i>
<P>
<DD>"Beyond the tedium of the day to day campaigning, there's another much 
more alarming development this year -- money. Huge amounts of money 
pouring into both parties, raising very serious questions about 
influence and conflict of interest." <i>-- Tom Brokaw opening the 
October 29 NBC Nightly News.</i>
<P>
"Of course Republicans, including Bob Dole and Jesse Helms, have also 
tapped into foreign fundraising. And none of these investigations will 
produce answers until months, or years, after election day." <i>-- Andrea 
Mitchell concluding her October 29 NBC Nightly News story.</i>
<P>
<DD>"On campaign finance, White House officials admit that both sides are 
dirty. The best defense: Republicans do it too." <i>-- Jim Miklaszewski, 
October 29 The News with Brian Williams on MSNBC.</i>
<P>
<b>Dole Was Okay When He Raised Taxes</b>
<DD>"Dole knows better. Columnist Matthew Miller has even fancifully suggested 
that the Senator's 15 percent tax cut proposal is really part of a secret 
Dole plan to have radical tax-cutting decisively repudiated at the polls. 
That way, the death of his political career can give life to the principle 
of fiscal responsibility that he devoted so many years of that career to 
advancing. If only." <i>-- Newsweek's Jonathan Alter, Oct. 21.</i>
<P>
<DD>"One of the roles of a journalist is to afflict the comfortable and 
comfort the afflicted. But after the debate ended, not one network news 
anchor or commentator noted the oddness of two presidential candidates 
hankering for tax handouts. Like Clinton and Dole, the anchors and 
television pundits earn more than 99 percent of all Americans. If 
those same TV commentators made say, $35,000 a year, they might 
have been more struck by Dole and Clinton's bantering." <i>-- U.S. 
News Senior Writer David Whitman, October 21</i>.
<P>
<DD>"By 1985, Reagan's economics had plunged the country into debt. 
Dole's all-out fight to lower the deficit became the defining battle 
of his career." <i>-- Actress Blair Brown narrating Frontline on PBS, 
October 8.</i>
<P>
"Just a year later, when he saw that supply-side economics had 
ballooned the deficit, Dole worked hard to raise government revenues 
by closing tax loopholes, and pushing through what was then the 
argest tax increase in history." <i>-- Ken Bode narrating "Bob 
Dole's Odyssey" in CNN's Democracy in America, Oct 20.</i>
<P>
<b>Charles Should Be In Charge</b>
<BR>
<DD>"Bob Dole is running around the country saying, `Where is the 
outrage?' Where is it? We now have the Democratic Party hiding 
this guy John Huang until after the election, who was out raising 
money. You've got rafts of big contributors all listing the same 
address, which is the Democratic national headquarters. Newsweek 
says you have the ambassador to Taiwan out there soliciting huge 
gifts from people, businessmen in Taiwan and you have Buddhist 
monks and nuns who have taken vows of poverty giving big amounts 
of money to the Democratic Party, and nobody seems to notice this. 
Somebody said the other day if the Republicans had done this the 
press would be killing them. Why are they getting away with this?"

<h3>Four items today:</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Here today, gone tomorrow. Tuesday night the three networks led with <a href="#stories">stories of Democratic fundraising.</a> Wednesday night neither ABC's World News Tonight or the CBS Evening News mentioned anything about Democratic fundraising. Only NBC Nightly News ran a piece.
<li>A tale of two campaigns. Third quarter GDP this year was below the rate in the same quarter in 1992. This year the networks gave a straight forward account, or offered a spin that favored Clinton. Announced one anchor: <a href="#slow">"The economy was slow,</a> but steady going in the last quarter. Many economists were encouraged by that because it means inflation is under control." That's not the treatment George Bush got four years ago.
<li>ABC's Charlie Gibson cited several Clinton scandals Tuesday morning and <a href="#pressing">asked why the media aren't pressing Democrats:</a> "If the Republicans had done this the press would be killing them. Why are they getting away with this?"
<li>A talk <a href="#host">show host and a former network news anchor</a> in bed together, add a little nudity on ABC, and you get... 
</ol>
<a name="stories">
1) The current issue of Newsweek includes a story about John 
Huang and a Clinton ally in Taiwan involved in questionable fundraising 
in that island nation. Wednesday's Los Angeles Times moved the story 
further. It began:
<br><dd>
"Mark Middleton, a little-known, 34-year-old ex-White House aide 
from Arkansas, was responsible for arranging a controversial encounter 
between President Clinton and Liu Tai-ying, the chief financial manager 
of Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang Party, in September 1995, officials said 
Tuesday." The LA Times went on to report that Liu offered to donate 
$15 million to the Clinton campaign, which would be illegal.
<P>
NBC Nightly News began Wednesday night (October 30) with three 
stories in a row on the campaign. In the third, Andrea Mitchell examined 
the Taiwan angle to the DNC/John Huang fundraising activities. She 
relayed allegations that a Clinton ally was "shaking down" Taiwan 
businessmen.
<P>
ABC or CBS coverage Wednesdsay night of this or any part of the 
DNC fundraising/Huang saga: Zilch. ABC didn't even air a full campaign 
story. CBS did relay Dole's newest target, as Phil Jones reported:
<BR><DD>
"Clinton White House ethical controversies also remained high on 
Dole's agenda. He took a swipe at Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary's 
government travel, while reminding supporters what they could do with 
the money from his 15 percent tax cut."
<BR><DD>
Dole: "You ought to take a vacation instead of Hazel O'Leary flying 
around the world at your expense."
<P>
<a name="slow">
2) In late October 1992 a 3rd quarter GDP of 2.7 percent was 
announced. October 30 of this year the 3rd quarter number was released: 
Just 2.2 percent. 
<P>
Wednesday night CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather announced the 
bad news: "The government is out with its final official report on 
economic growth before the election. And it indicates a dramatic 
slowdown. In the third quarter of the year the U.S. economy grew at 
an annual rate of just 2.2 percent, that is less than half the growth 
rate of the second quarter. It didn't take long for the presidential 
candidates to put their own spins on today's economic numbers."
<P>
Phil Jones did a story with Dole's reaction, followed by Rita Braver, 
who began: "Mr. Clinton did not mention the sharp economic slowdown in 
the last quarter. Instead, he looked at the overall numbers for the year 
and claimed things are just getting better..."
<P>
Up next, Ray Brady identified the culprit: falling consumer spending. 
Brady noted: "There's one irony here. On election day 1992 the economy 
was starting to pick up, but voters hadn't felt it yet. Remember that 
expression, 'It's the economy stupid'? And George Bush went down to 
defeat. On election day 1996 the economy seems to be slowing, but not 
enough so that most voters will be feeling it."
<P>
Why hadn't voters in 1992 "felt it"? Could it be because the media
kept putting the worst possible spin on 1992 economic news? Well, to
find out I sojourned into the MRC tape library. Let's start with CBS. 
On October 27, 1992, the day of the GDP announcement, Dan Rather 
asserted: 
<BR><DD>
"Just one week before the election and the Bush administration says
the U.S. economy has turned the corner and started expanding again, but 
there is some doubt about the accuracy of the figures, and even if they 
are accurate, they may be too little too late to help President Bush 
because it was also announced today that consumer confidence in the
economy continues to fall."
<P>
Reporter Susan Spencer reported in from the Bush campaign: "He crowed 
today at upbeat news of a third quarter growth rate of 2.7 percent, though 
some economists warned that may not hold."
<P>
Rather was right about the number being inaccurate, but not in the
direction he thought. It was later revised upward to 3.9 percent for
the 3rd quarter.
<P>
On September 4, 1992 anchor Connie Chung led the show: "Today's 
unemployment report from the government appears hopeful on the surface.
It says the nation's unemployment rate is down slightly for the second 
month in a row. But the latest decline is a result of a summer jobs 
program for teenagers. That program is about to end, and as Ray Brady 
reports, the picture ahead is bleak."
<P>
Brady: "...Bare minutes after the announcement, the Federal Reserve 
moved to cut interest rates to speed the economy. But those strikes and
layoffs at General Motors, and thousands of inner city kids soon to come
off those summer job payrolls. Those could mean bad news for next month's 
figures. After hitting a high of 7.8 percent for June, then dipping a 
tenth of a point again last month, most economists now predict next
month's jobless rate could hit 7.8 percent."
<P>
One month later, the rate fell from 7.6 to 7.5 percent. Let's go to
the October 2, 1992 CBS Evening News. Ray Brady skipped over his mistake
and offered a new reason to dismiss the good news: "Those unemployment 
lines did become a bit shorter last month, but economists say that's 
largely because many Americans simply stopped looking for work, so 
they're no longer counted as unemployed....The fact is, 17 months 
after the recovery started, the economy is stuck in neutral, partly 
because business is running scared. It's not expanding like in a 
recovery, but it is cutting back like in a recession."
<P>
In between the two unemployment reports, on the September 15, 1992 
CBS Evening News, Dan Rather began the broadcast: "Seven weeks now until 
election day and new figures out today indicate the economy is flat. 
The government officially reported today that retail sales plunged 
half a percent last month, biggest drop in five months, hardest hit 
appliances and automobiles. Another sign of a sluggish economy: 
consumer prices rose just three-tenths of a percent."
<P>
CBS was not the only culprit. Look at ABC and NBC.
<P>
<b>ABC's World News Tonight</b>
<P>
<DD>October 30, 1996:
<BR><DD>
Peter Jennings: "In politics today, the economy as viewed from 
two sides. The government reports today that the economy slowed down 
over the summer. The Gross Domestic Product, which measures all economic 
activity, was up 2.2 percent, but that is less than half the 4.7 percent 
growth in the second quarter. President Clinton who was campaigning in 
Michigan noted that many economists say a cooling off is necessary to 
keep inflation down and therefore, he thinks, the numbers were good news. 
Senator Dole on the other hand was in Tennessee earlier today, along with 
Mrs. Dole. He says the numbers are cause for concern. He went on to say 
if Mr. Clinton is re-elected there could be a recession."
<P>
<DD>October 27, 1992
<BR><DD>
Peter Jennings: "The [2.7 percent GDP] is more than economists had 
projected, but in many cases, less than meets the eye." 
<BR><DD>
Bob Jamieson: "The increase in economic growth was driven by a surge 
in consumer spending. The best news came from spending for big appliances 
and furniture, which rose by nearly nine percent. But many economists say 
the report is not proof the economy is taking a sharp turn for the better."
<BR><DD>
The next day, October 28, 1992, Jennings warned: "The President may 
complain about the news media, but the economic growth figures which he 
is so pleased about are not that definitive, according to a great many 
independent economic analysts."
<P>
<b>NBC Nightly News:</b>
<P>
<DD>October 30, 1996:
<BR><DD>
Tom Brokaw: "We're now down to five full days before the election 
and the President is mostly protecting his lead while Bob Dole is 
looking for any last minute opening. And today again he tried the 
national economy. The economy was slow, but steady going in the last 
quarter. Many economists were encouraged by that because it means 
inflation is under control and interest rates will stay low. But, 
Bob Dole has another vision. So, we begin tonight with NBC's David Bloom."
<BR><DD>
Bloom told how "Bob Dole predicted today that Bill Clinton's 
re-election would plunge the nation into another recession." Jim 
Miklaszewski then gave Clinton's more upbeat spin.
<BR>
<DD>October 27, 1992 Nightly News:
<BR><DD>
Tom Brokaw: "The President tonight finally has an economic number 
that he can brag about, but at the same time consumers were checking 
in today and they're yet to be persuaded that this economy is turning 
around. The good number is the Gross Domestic Product, that's the rate 
of economic growth July through September. It hit 2.7 percent, that's 
well above what most economists predicted. But in this unusual economy, 
that's not enough, not with another report out today showing a sharp 
drop in consumer confidence."
<P>
All this matches the Center for Media and Public Affairs finding
that "in September 1992, 98 percent of all sources on the evening news
criticized the state of the economy."
<P>
<a name="pressing">
3) Discussing the campaign with Cokie Roberts and Bill Kristol on 
Tuesday's Good Morning America, Charlie Gibson acknowledged media bias:
<BR><DD>
"Let me get to a second thing. Bob Dole is running around the country 
saying, 'Where is the outrage?' Where is it? We now have the Democratic 
Party hiding this guy John Huang until after the election, who was out 
raising money. You've got rafts of big contributors all listing the same 
address, which is the Democratic National headquarters. Newsweek says you 
have the ambassador to Taiwan out there soliciting huge gifts from people, 
businessmen in Taiwan and you have Buddhist monks and nuns who have taken 
vows of poverty giving big amounts of money to the Democratic Party, and 
nobody seems to notice this. Somebody said the other day if the Republicans 
had done this the press would be killing them. Why are they getting away 
with this?"
<P>
As noted above, Wednesday's World News Tonight didn't mention any of 
the topics raised by Gibson.
<P>
<a name="host">
4) So what are former CBS News anchor Connie Chung and husband Maury 
Povich up to? See for yourself, as USA Today's October 30 "People" section 
reported Povich's tale of the bedroom:
<BR><DD>
"Sharon Lawrence 'did me one of the great favors of all time,' the talk 
show host said on Tuesday's Fox After Breakfast. 'I've never met the woman, 
but the other night on the episode of NYPD Blue...her semi-nude shot. Connie 
and I were in bed and the shot comes on. I got very lucky. I really did. 
Thank you, Sharon Lawrence, until my dying day. One of the great nights 
of all time."
<P>
Wonder what happens when Maury orders up one of those pay-per-view 
cable movies?

<h3>Four items today:</h3>
<ol>
<li>The <a href="#dnc">Washington Post's front page story on the DNC's decision to not file a FEC report on early October activities, followed later Tuesday by a reversal of that decision, and all on a day when John Huang gave a videotaped deposition, prompted the three broadcast networks to lead with DNC finances</a> Tuesday night.  But the networks also relayed the Democratic spin: Republicans do it too. NBC reported that "White House officials admit that both sides are dirty."
<li><a href="#attack">CBS Tuesday night labeled a Clinton attack "one the harshest,"</a> but it was more than harsh, it was downright preposterous.
<li>The <a href="#nyt">New York Times charged Tuesday that Bob Dole wants to destroy 32 years of civil rights work,</a> but the newspaper counts employer paid continuing education as a "civil right."  
<li><a href="#gorby">Tom Brokaw, hosting Tuesday's MSNBC InterNight, called Mikhail Gorbachev "a courageous, far-seeing prophet"</a> and said he hopes Gorbachev returns to office. 
</ol>

<a name="dnc">
1) Viewers of Tuesday morning's Today learned that
Republicans are "doing the same thing." As transcribed by MRC
analyst Geoffrey Dickens, 
<P>
<DD><i>Katie Couric asked Tim Russert</i>: "Tim, let's talk about the big news this morning. It's that the
Democratic National Committee will not file its required final
statement of campaign finances by November 5th. Which is really
unheard of. Why are they doing this?"<BR>
<DD><i>Russert responded</i>: "Because they are afraid of what's in
there Katie, obviously. This has become an obscene process! It is
outrageous the amount of money that is pouring into both these
political parties! I do think the Democrats have probably taken
it to a new level, a lower level...."<br>
<DD><i>Couric then asked</i>: "Well Tim if Republicans are doing the
same thing what are people supposed to think?"<BR>
<DD><i>Russert</i>: "Well I think If anything comes of this is that the
American people and the media and other people of good intentions
in the political process will say,  Hey we embarrassed ourselves!
We elevated or lowered, excuse me, this political process to
levels of cynicism where the American people said,  Oh you all
take foreign money.' And they finally, finally do something to
clean up this mess. Because it has become a sewer Katie."
<P>
<i>On the CBS Evening News Tuesday night, Rita Braver concluded
her story from the trail with Clinton</i>: "Aides say he will
probably deliver a speech on campaign finance reform later in the
week, trying to paint Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich as the people
who stopped tougher laws."
<P>
<i>Tom Brokaw opened the October 29 NBC Nightly News</i>: 
    "If this campaign has an unofficial motto, it is this:  Wake
me when it's over.' But, beyond the tedium of the day to day
campaigning, there's another much more alarming development this
year -- money. Huge amounts of money pouring into both parties,
raising very serious questions about influence and conflict of
interest."
<P>
    <i>That led into story from Andrea Mitchell in which she
asserted</i>: "Of course Republicans, including Bob Dole and Jesse
Helms, have also tapped into foreign fundraising. And none of
these investigations will produce answers until months, or years,
after election day."
<P>
    Brokaw and Mitchell failed to distinguish between accepting
money from foreign nationals for campaign spending, which is
illegal, and getting money from Taiwan businessmen for a
foundation-run museum, as Helms did, which is legal.
<P>
    <i>Later, on MSNBC's The News with Brian Williams, NBC reporter
Jim Miklaszewski offered a nice spin that had the Clinton
campaign "admitting" the Republican are just a bad</i>: "On campaign
finance, White House officials admit that both sides are dirty.
The best defense: Republicans do it too."
<P>
<a name="attack">
2) Earlier in Rita Braver's piece cited above, she noted
that heckling from Ohio college students "provoked one of the
President's harshest attacks of the whole campaign on Bob Dole."
<P>
<DD><i>Clinton</i>: "I would be screaming too if I wanted a country that
took Head Start and Big Bird away from five year olds, school
lunches away from ten year years, summer jobs away from 15 year
olds and college loans away from 20 year olds."
<P>
    Harsh yes, but Braver could have noted the charge has no
basis in reality.
<P>
<a name="nyt">
3) <b>"Dole Attacks 32 Years of Civil Rights Laws"</b> declared a
October 29 <i>New York Times</i> headline. In an October 20 New York
review of Bill Clinton's civil rights record, reporter Steven
Holmes began: "In his nearly four years in office, President
Clinton has amassed a civil rights record rivaling that of any
President in the last 30 years." Holmes insisted that George Bush
and Ronald Reagan "often seemed hostile or indifferent to civil
rights issues."
<P>
As pointed out to me by MRC analyst Clay Waters, The New York
Times has a pretty broad definition of civil rights. In a box
beside the Holmes story, the paper listed "promises in the civil
rights area that President Clinton made as a candidate in 1992."
Here are some:
<ul>
<li>"Lift caps on damage awards in sex discrimination cases."
<li>"Work to pass Motor Voter bill."
<li>"Support statehood for the District of Columbia."
<li>"Require every employer to spend 1.5 percent of payroll for continuing education and training."
<li>"Expand Earned-Income Tax Credit."
</ul>
<a name="gorby">
4) Mikhail's Gorbachev's book tour brought him to MSNBC's
InterNight on Tuesday night, October 29. Tom Brokaw opened the
show:<br>
<dd>"It's likely that your view of Mikhail Gorbachev depends on
your point of view. From the perspective of the West, the former
President of the Soviet Union of course was a courageous, far-seeing 
prophet whose reforms set in motion the collapse of the Soviet 
dictatorship and the end of the Cold War."
<P>
    Thirty minutes later Brokaw concluded the interview with
another salute to the communist:<br>
<dd>"We always welcome you in this country, Mikhail Gorbachev.
We're especially pleased to have you tonight on InterNight. And
we offer our very best, of course, to Raisa Gorbachev and we hope
that you'll have a long and happy life. Perhaps one day again
we'll see you in political office in Russia. We know that you've
devoted your life to peace and to changing your country and those
of us who have gotten to know you count ourselves among the
privileged."
<P>
    From the perspective of a Western journalist, maybe, ignoring
both the internal collapse of communism despite Gorbachev's
efforts to save it and the role of Ronald Reagan.

<P>
<font size=+2>1)</font> On Friday's Washington Week in Review on PBS (October 25),
NBC's Gwen Ifill opined: "In a year when you talk about, corporations 
who give $25,00 chunks of money, why are people particularly outraged
when people with last names like Cabrera and people from India
and Korea and Indonesia and China all of a sudden get, there just
seems to be a lot of foreigner bashing as a subtext in some of
the criticism."
<P>
    It took Wall Street Journal Washington Bureau Chief Alan Murray
to tell her the obvious: "It is against the law for non-residents,
foreign companies, foreign governments to give money to political
campaigns. Now what's happening here is the money seems to be
legal residents, but some of them have admitted, I mean there was
this one woman who we talked to who admitted it wasn't her money.
Someone came and handed her $5,000, it was a money laundering
system."
<P>
    As for Cabrera, could it be that, well, he's now serving a 19-year
sentence for smuggling 6,000 pounds of cocaine into the U.S?
<p>
<br>
<a name="federal">
<p><br>
<font size=+2>2) </font> On Friday a panel of judges authorized independent counsel
Kenneth Starr to investigate whether former White House counsel
Bernard Nussbaum lied about his knowledge of Hillary Clinton's
involvement in the FBI files matter.
<P>
     On the October 28 Today Sunday morning, NBC's Tim Russert
insisted: "This is dead serious. I mean the ethical problems
of the Clinton Administration are now troubling even to the most
partisan Democrats. The incident you're talking about is that
the Attorney General of the United States, Janet Reno, requested
that the special prosecutor look into whether or not Bernard
Nussbaum, counsel to the President of the United States, lied
about Hillary Clinton's role in Travelgate. This is dead serious
stuff and I don't know how we can dismiss it nine days before an
election."
<P>
    So how much emphasis did the networks give this "dead serious"
development? In Sunday's Washington Post Howard Kurtz reported that 
"it was not reported by the three network evening newscasts" Friday 
night. 
<P>
    That's not quite true, but it was hardly a major story. The CBS 
Evening News didn't mention the news. On ABC's World News Tonight
anchor Forrest Sawyer read a brief item. And how did Russert's NBC,
where he is Washington Bureau Chief, treat a story that he insists 
can't be dismissed nine days before election day? NBC Nightly News 
offered viewers only a brief item read by anchor Brian Williams. 
<P>
    In his Post piece, Kurtz quoted Russert's reaction to Dole's
liberal bias charge: "I find it ironic that Dole is criticizing the
media for not covering all the stories we broke. Whether it's the 
Indonesian gardener or the Buddhist monks, he should be crediting
the LA Times, Washington Post, New York Times and Wall Street Journal.
I think his anger is misplaced."
<P>
    Hmmm. Which media outlets didn't Russert credit? Any of the 
networks, not even his own.
<p>
<br>
<a name="dole">
<p><br>
<br>
 <font size=+2>3) </font> Affirmative action and immigration have been winning issues 
for Republicans in California and by coincidence they are just the 
subjects that NBC's David Bloom has tagged "divisive." 
<P>
    After showing a clip of a Dole immigration ad, on the Saturday, 
October 26 NBC Nightly News, Bloom concluded: "But even many Republicans 
who believe Dole could have won here on a divisive issue like 
immigration, now say it's too late." The next night, Sunday, Bloom 
concluded his story from California: "Until now, Dole on the campaign 
stump, had largely shied away from divisive social issues like 
affirmative action for fear of alienating swing voters. Not anymore."
<p>
<br>
<a name="al">
<p><br>
<br>
<font size=+2>4)</font> In the beginning of the show story Sunday for This Week
with David Brinkley, ABC's John Cochran looked at how Republicans
are now separating themselves from Dole, suggesting to voters that
they need a check on a re-elected Clinton. He concluded with this 
bizarre analogy: "Going into the the homestretch, the campaign
is taking on feint overtones of the old protection racket with
Republicans increasingly sounding like the Capone gang, offering
protection against Bugsy Clinton and his mob."
<p>
<br>
<a name="cbs">
<p><br>
<br>
<font size=+2>5) </font> Finally, a little reality check for Clinton. Here's an excerpt 
from Friday's CBS Evening News story by Bill Plante:
<P><blockquote>
    Plante: "But while Mr. Clinton walks the high road on the stump. 
His advertising, all of which he personally approves, has been 
overwhelmingly negative. He courted young voters today with a message 
of hope. A new ad courts senior voters with a message of fear."
<P> Clinton ad: "You've worked you whole life and hoped for a secure
retirememt. That's why it's so wrong that Dole and Gingrich tried
to slash Medicare $270 billion."
<P> 
   Plante: "Never mind that the President's own budget would have
cut future Medicare spending almost as much."
</blockquote>
<P>
    Now that the election is in the bag for Clinton it's safe for the
networks to scrutinize his claims. 
<P>

<H3>Five items today:</H3>
<ol>
<li>In an address at the National Press Club on Thursday, <a href="#Perot">Ross Perot rejected the Dole campaign's overture to endorse Dole</a> and he criticized Bill Clinton's character. The three evening shows highlighted the first, but ABC's World News Tonight failed to report Perot's anti-Clinton comments. Both ABC and NBC charged that Bob Dole "lashed out" at Clinton." NBC's Gwen Ifill complained that "Perot barely mentioned Republican Bob Dole, even though he also accepts contributions from overseas." On CBS, Phil Jones said the Perot gambit demonstrates that Dole is "determined to try anything."
<li>After Wednesday's order proved fruitless, on Thursday a federal judge issued another order <a href="#huang">demanding the DNC to produce John Huang.</a> Of the broadcast network evening shows, only ABC's World News Tonight reported the effort to locate him.
<li>On CBS, Dan Rather offered an uncritical look at video of <a href="#devout">Bill Clinton hugging a "devout Catholic"</a> after convincing her that it was okay for him to veto the partial birth abortion bill.
<li>NBC's Lisa Myers contended on MSNBC that <a href="#tax">tax cuts are incompatible with balancing the budget.</a> By promising a tax cut, she charged, Bob Dole "seems to have cast aside the most enduring commitment of his 35 year career -- balancing the budget."
<li>Republican House <a href="#chenoweth">freshman Helen Chenoweth</a> told Tom Brokaw that she's "just a plain spoken Western woman." Brokaw countered on Thursday's Nightly News: "Not exactly. In her first term Chenoweth was a cheerleader for the New Right." 
</ol>
<a name="Perot">    
1) Thursday night (October 24) ABC's World News Tonight made
no mention of Perot's comments about Clinton's character. Instead,
ABC emphasized Dole's attack, saying he was "livid" when he 
criticized the media. Anchor Diane Sawyer announced: "In a speech 
in Florida Mr. Dole lashed out at the President and a lot of other 
people too."
<P>
<DD>Reporter Jim Wooten began: "Clearly frustrated by his stalled 
campaign, Senator Dole was fiercely critical today not only of the 
American media, but of the American public as well for not recognizing 
his virtues and the President's vices....As for the press, he was 
practically livid, telling an audience of the faithful in Pensacola
that the sins of the Clinton administration are being concealed by 
partisan newspapers and networks."
<BR><DD>
Dole: "Now we know the liberal media's not going to report on all 
these things because they want him re-elected. They like it the way 
it is. We need the media to tell the American people the truth and the 
truth is Bill Clinton ought to be voted out of office in a landslide."
<P>
    NBC Nightly News did run clips of Perot's attacks on Clinton, 
but in trying to lessen the damage to Clinton Gwen Ifill failed 
to distinguish between accepting money from foreign nationals, which is 
illegal, with getting money from U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies 
or from naturalized citizens, which is legal:
<BR><DD>
    Gwen Ifill: "Ross Perot attempted to blast his way back into 
contention today with a scathing indictment of President Clinton and 
the Democratic party's fundraising tactics, which includes accepting 
money from abroad."
<BR><DD>
    Perot: "If you love this country and your children, how could you 
even consider voting for a candidate that has huge moral, ethical and 
criminal problems facing him as our country has problems to solve."
<BR><DD>
    Ifill: "Perot barely mentioned Republican Bob Dole, even though 
he also accepts contributions from overseas."
<P>
    Next, David Bloom reported in from the Dole campaign. His piece
began:
<BR><DD>
    "Spurned by Ross Perot, an admittedly frustrated Bob Dole lashed 
out today at voters"
<BR><DD>
    Dole: "Wake up America."
<BR><DD>
    Bloom: "At President Clinton's ethics."
<BR><DD>
    Dole: "This is a disgrace."
<BR><DD>
    Bloom: "And especially at the liberal media, who Dole blamed for 
trying to engineer his defeat."
<BR><DD>
    Dole: "We need the media to tell the American people the truth, 
and the truth is Bill Clinton ought to be voted out of office in a 
landslide."
<BR><DD>
    On the CBS Evening News this is how Phil Jones concluded his story
on Perot and Dole: "Perot says he finds the whole Dole request to be 
weird. Was it an act of desperation? No says one top Dole aide. He 
calls it determined, determined to try anything."
<P>
<a name="huang">
2) Last Sunday, DNC General Chairman Chris Dodd promised that 
John Huang would be made available to the media. So far, no one's been
able to find the DNC fundraiser (and former Commerce Department 
official) responsible for bringing in the illegal $250,000 from 
South Korea and hundreds of thousands of dollars in other questionable
donations from overseas. On Thursday, a federal judge took action. As
reported by Brian Ross on Thursday's World News Tonight (October 24):
<P>
    Brian Ross on John Huang: "In Washington today, a federal judge 
ordered Democratic Party lawyers into court and told them to produce 
John Huang to testify in a civil lawsuit alleging favoritism at the 
Commerce Department for big Democratic contributors. The judge's unusual 
action came after Huang could not be found at his home in Glendale 
California or when U.S. Marshall's went to an address yesterday in 
Washington that the judge had ordered the Commerce Department to 
provide..."
<P>
    Reporter Mark Litke followed with a dispatch from Jakarta on 
the Lippo conglomerate's Asian empire and ties to Clinton.
<P>
    While ABC thus updated viewers on the Indonesian scandal, neither
CBS Evening News or NBC Nightly News mentioned the scandal or Huang's
name. (CNN's Inside Politics did offer an anchor-read brief.)
<P>
<a name="devout">
3) Over video of Bill Clinton along a rope line talking with a 
teenage girl who at first is crying, then is smiling and, finally, is 
hugging Clinton, Dan Rather announced on the October 24 CBS Evening 
News: 
<BR><DD>
    "In Louisiana President Clinton had this tearful encounter today 
with a teenager. She said she was a devout Catholic and was upset with 
the President's veto of a bill banning late-term abortions. The 
President spoke with her awhile, saying he had vetoed that bill after
talking with women who might have died without the procedure. As you 
see, this seemed to satisfy the teenager who said she felt better and 
would tell her mother 'it's okay to vote for President Clinton,' 
unquote."
<P>
   Of course, Rather didn't bother telling viewers that the bill 
Clinton vetoed had a life or health of the mother exception.
<P>
<a name="tax">
4) MSNBC's News with Brian Williams on Tuesday night (October
22) ran a profile of Dole by Lisa Myers. It began:
<P>
    Lisa Myers: "The heart and soul of Dole's agenda is his economic 
program, built around the bold, some say extravagant, promise."
<BR><DD>
    Bob Dole: "We'll have a President who will cut taxes 15 percent 
across the board for every taxpayer in America."
<BR><DD>
    Myers: "With that promise, that half a trillion dollar tax cut, 
Dole seems to have cast aside the most enduring commitment of his 
35 year career -- balancing the budget."
<P>
<a name="chenoweth">
5) Thursday night Tom Brokaw narrated an "In-Depth" segment
exploring big money from special interests pouring into congressional
races. His case study: The Idaho race of GOP freshmen Helen
Chenoweth (targetted by labor unions) vs. Democrat Dan Williams.
<P>
    Brokaw asserted: "Helen Chenoweth, a controversial first term 
Republican Congresswoman."
<BR><DD>
    Chenoweth: "I don't have a clue why they would target me. I 
come from an innocuous state. I'm just a plain-spoken Western woman."
<BR><DD>
    Brokaw: "Not exactly. In her first term Chenoweth was a cheerleader 
for the New Right. Voting against an increase in the minimum wage, 
trashing traditional environmental organizations. She was a hardliner 
on gun laws. So, she is a target of big labor and conservationists."
<P>
    Brokaw didn't make any negative comments about the views espoused
by the Democratic candidate. He concluded by noting that the two
candidates have debated, "But their campaigns are trapped in a cloud 
of money, saturating the air, polluting the political process, and 
that's a loss for everyone."
<P>
    So is a campaign trapped in a cloud of media distortion, polluting
the fair and balanced dissemination of political views.

<ol>
<li>Developments on the <a href="#foreign">foreign citizen fundraising</a> front continue, but TV network viewers don't hear anything about them. On Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times reported a major DNC donor had no money of his own to donate and a federal judge issued a subpoena for John Huang, now in hiding. None of the broadcast networks reported the first item; only one reported the second, but two found time to mention the sentencing of a Dole fundraiser. 
<li>NBC's Today on Wednesday reported nothing about the campaign during its two hour broadcast, but devoted a top of the show segment to a major crisis: Denial of <a href="#toilet">toliet paper to Detroit public school students</a>. 
<li>One Wednesday newspaper headline declared that Clinton is maintaining lead in California. Another the same day relayed that Dole and <a href="#catching">Republicans are catching up</a>.
test
<li>Dole's not gaining in the polls, so what's to blame. A CBS reporter Wednesday morning suggested "that his harsh <a href="#backfired">tactics may have backfired."</a> 
<li>A wealthy <a href="#actor">Hollywood actor and producer</a> identified, on Wednesday's NBC Nightly News, what ails America: Too much concern about making money. 
</ol>
<p>
<a name="foreign">
1) <b>"$325,000 Gift to Democrats Raises New Set of Questions:
Relative of Mahatma Gandhi Who Made Donation Say's he's Now in
Debt. DNC Calls Money Legal."</b> -- October 23 <i>Los Angeles Times</I>
front page.  
<P>
    It's illegal for foreign citizens to contribute to U.S.
campaigns, so the question in the case of Gandhi is whether
his donation really came from foreign nations.
<P>
    Keeping that in mind, here's the lead of the LA Times
story:<b> "The state of California says Yogesh K. Gandhi owes
$10,000 in back taxes. His California driver's license has
been revoked because he has failed to pay his traffic fines.
Claiming pauper status, he did not pay the $20 filing fee for
his divorce.
<BR><DD>"Yet Gandhi...gave a hefty a hefty $325,000 to the Democratic
National Committee....Gandhi emerged Tuesday as the latest in
a series of campaign donors whose contributions are raising
questions about the influence of foreign money in American politics.
Like the others, Gandhi's contribution was handled by John Huang,
the DNC fundraiser who brought in a series of six-figure donations,
some of which have proven illegal or suspect."</b>
<BR><DD>Speaking of Huang, he went into hiding last week to avoid the
media. On Wednesday, a federal judge issued a subpoena for him
to appear.
<P>
    How were these two developments reported Wednesday night? The 
LA Times story was not reported by any of the three evening shows
-- not ABC's World Nes Tonight, CBS Evening News or NBC Nightly News.
<P>
    Only NBC Nightly News reported the subpoena for Huang. On
the CBS Evening News Dan Rather noted, without offering any 
specifics, how the Clinton team were trying to ignore the foreign
money angle and had asked the FEC to investigate. Eric Engberg then
did a Reality Check on how it takes years for the FEC to complete
an investigation. 
<P>
    But immediately after Engberg's piece, Dan Rather announced that
Simon Fireman, a former Dole fundraiser, had been ordered to pay $6
million in fines for laundering money to avoid contribution limits.
NBC's Tom Brokaw also mentioned Simon as he introduced a piece by
Lisa Myers on soft money fundraising by both parties. 
<P>
<a name="toilet">
2) Thirteen days until the election, but on Wednesday
Today couldn't find time for any mention of the campaign, MRC
analyst Geoffrey Dickens observed. But Today devoted the second
segment of the 7am half hour to a major crisis in Detroit:
access to toilet paper in the schools. 
<P>
    Interviewing David Snead, superintendent of the Detroit 
schools, Bryant Gumbel became enraged at the new rules which
restrict how much toilet paper students can use. He demanded:
"Hang on one second! One second! I saw a quote, one second!
David Snead I saw a quote from Charlie Fobbs. He is your Director 
of Housekeeping and Grounds for your school district. He said,
his words, 'They need to teach them, the students, to use only
the amount they need.' Isn't the matter of how much toilet paper
one needs rather personal?" 
<P>
    Gumbel's latest definition of civil rights: Unlimited access
to toilet paper. How long until Clinton proposes a federal
"Equal Access to Toilet Paper Act"?
<P>
<a name="catching">
3) Two contrasting headlines from Wednesday October 23:
<BR><DD>
    On the front page of the Los Angeles Times: <b>"Clinton Keeping 
Solid Lead Over Dole in State"</b>
<BR><DD>
    On the front page of Investor's Business Daily: <b>"California 
Vote Is Back in Play: Shrinking Gap in Polls Spurs a Heavy GOP Push"</b>
<P>
<a name="backfired">
4) On Wednesday's This Morning on CBS reporter Sandra 
Hughes offered her opinion of why Dole isn't catching up.
As caught and transcribed by MRC analyst Steve Kaminski, this is 
how she concluded her October 23 story: <b>"Dole criticized Clinton 
for raising taxes and breaking campaign promises. But over the 
past few days, his tough talking rhetoric has been noticeably 
toned down even though Dole won't admit that his harsh
tactics may have backfired."</b>
<P>
    Maybe if the media didn't condemn as "harsh" every anti-Clinton 
comment made by Dole, his pointing out some of Clinton's character
problems wouldn't have "backfired."
<p>
<a name="actor">
5) Starting this week and through election day, NBC Nightly
News is running a series called <i>"Fixing America"</i> in which various
leaders in different fields tell what they think should be done.
Wednesday night's offerings included this from actor/producer
Henry Winkler, aka "The Fonz" in Happy Days back in the 1970s:
<br><DD>
    "I think that we have to humanize America. I think that the 
worst thing that ever happened to this country was the quarterly 
report. The pride of process. The pride of what we do and the 
people who do it, the population, are being moved aside just so 
that we can show a profit three or four times a year. I think 
we're going to bottom line ouservelves into oblivion."
<P>
    Remember that before you put any money down to buy a ticket
to one of his future movies.

<h3>Five items today:</h3>
<ol>
<li>On Monday and Tuesday nights the CBS and NBC evening <a href="#newscasts">newscasts did not run any stories</a>
from their correspondents traveling with Clinton and Dole. ABC didn't on Tuesday either, but Monday night ABC's Brit Hume
actually employed the term "harsh" to Clinton.
<li>The <a href="#fundraising">questionable fundraising sources</a> for the Democrats is getting some network attention. Tuesday night's World News Tonight included a story a  Florida drug dealer invited to a White House dinner.

<li>PBS's Frontline asks <a href="#press">"Why America Hates the Press."</a> But in one hour a reason left unmentioned: liberal bias.
<li>CNN's <a href="#rook">Susan Rook</a> cites Bob Dole's divorce as proof his word is not his bond.
</ol>
<a name="newscasts">
<hr>
1) Monday night CBS and NBC covered the day's campaigning with 
their anchors giving brief reports. NBC Nightly News ran a lengthy piece 
from Andrea Mitchell on the Indonesian money trail.
<P>
On the October 21 World News Tonight, Brit Hume reported President 
Clinton's reaction to the fundraising scandals. Hume offered a unique use 
of the term "harsh," applying it to Clinton instead of Dole:
<P>
<DD>"President Clinton though stayed as far above the fracas as possible. 
He personally said not a word about it as he campaigned in Ohio and Michigan
today. But his campaign thought enough of the matter to send out a spokesman 
to denounce Bob Dole on it in the harshest terms."
<BR>
<DD>Joe Lockhart, Clinton-Gore Press Secretary: "You know Bob Dole talking 
about campaign finance reform is like Dr. Jack Kevorkian talking about the 
sanctity of life. It doesn't work. He has no credibility."
<P>
<a name="fundraising">
<hr>
2) On Tuesday's World News Tonight (October 22) Brian Ross explored a 
convicted drug dealer who got a White House dinner for his $20,000.
<P>
<DD>Brian Ross: "At the very time twice convicted Jorge Cabrera was setting 
up his latest cocaine smuggling deal last December in the Florida Keys, 
Democratic fundraisers were arranging for him to attend a White House dinner 
with President Clinton. All it took was a $20,000 campaign contribution to 
the Democratic Party...."
<BR>
<DD>"A few weeks after the White House dinner federal agents raided Cabrera's 
hideout and seized more than 5,000 pounds of cocaine, leading to Cabrera's 
conviction in July. Still, the Democrats didn't return his money until last 
week when after a  reporter for Newsweek asked about it and the party finally 
checked into Cabrera's background. According to Cabrera's lawyer there are 
pictures of the drug smuggler at the White House and at another dinner here 
in Florida with Vice President Gore. But federal prosecutors demanded all 
copies and negatives of those photos and the Justice Department is refusing 
to make them public."
<P>

3) MRC analyst Steve Kaminski caught this humorous sequence during a 
story on Monday's This Morning on who Dole and Clinton might appoint to the 
Supreme Court. 
<P>
<DD>CBS reporter Troy Roberts: "Court observers believe a Bob Dole presidency 
would move the court to the right and President Clinton would stick with 
moderate appointments should he win a second term."
<P>
<DD>Clint Bolick, Institute for Justice: "Bill Clinton has tended to appoint 
very well qualified people but people who are quite liberal. I expect that he'll 
continue doing that if he gets a second term and the Republican Senate will have 
no option but to confirm those people." 
<P>
<a name="press">
<hr>
4) In most markets Tuesday night PBS aired an edition of Frontline 
titled "Why America Hates the Press." The show approached the subject from the 
left, using the James Fallows critique as its guide. There was plenty on the 
evils of the McLaughlin Group, celebrity journalism, reporters taking speaking 
fees and how awful it was for the Washington Post to put on the front page a 
story about Bob Woodward's new book.
<P>
One theme that was absent: Any consideration of how liberal bias might be 
turning people off. Just take a look at this list of those featured in the PBS 
show, as listed in the Washington Post's TV Week on Sunday:
<P>
"Michael Kelly, editor of the New Republic; the New York Times's R.W. 'Johnny' 
Apple; James Fallows of U.S. News & World report; Tom Brokaw and Andrea Mitchell 
of NBC News; Tim Russert, host of NBC's Meet the Press; McLaughlin Group panelists 
Jack Germond of the Balitimore Sun, Clarence Page of the Chicago Tribune; 
Howard Kurtz, Bob Woodward and David Broder of The Washington Post; Paul Taylor, 
a former Post reporter; and National Public Radio's Elizabeth Arnold and 
Cokie Roberts."
<P>
Not a conservative in the list. Fred Barnes snuck on a couple of times, but not
to discuss anything about bias.

5) CNN's Susan Rook took a nice little pot shot at Bob Dole last week. 
In his Media Notes column on October 21, The Washington Post's Howard Kurtz relayed 
an exchange from CNN's TalkBack Live (3-4pm ET), though he didn't provide a show date. 
<P>
After the RNC's Ed Gillespie asserted that for Bob Dole "his word is his bond," 
Rook shot back: "Which word are we talking about? The word to his first wife when 
he said, 'Until death do us part?'" Kurtz noted that after an audience member called 
it a cheap shot, Rook agreed: "Mea culpa. My apologies to Bob and Elizabeth Dole."

<h3>Three items today:</h3>
<ol>
<li>ABC's Cokie Roberts reported that <a href="#freshmen">Newt Gingrich and the House freshmen</a> "shut down the government."
<li>The <a href="#sandinistas">Sandinistas were just "socialists"</a> according to Peter Jennings. And ABC's Beth Nissen relayed that Daniel Ortega's theme song is Beethoven's Ode to Joy and his TV ads portray him as a "Latino Gandhi."
<li>The networks ignored the pardon issue for weeks and have yet to report anything about <a href="#livingstone">Craig Livingstone's assistant Mari Anderson</a> contradicting his story on the FBI files, but Washington Post reporter Howard Kurtz thinks a panel of reporters would have raised the topics in last week's debate. 
</ol>
<a name="freshmen">
<hr>
1) On Friday's World News Tonight (October 18), ABC's Cokie
Roberts explored whether Democrats might take back control of the
House. When conservatives complain that the media are
misinforming the public about Medicare cuts and how the
Republicans closed down the government, reporters counter that
they are only reporting what "Democrats say." Well, Roberts said
they "remind voters" of how Republicans caused the shutdown, as
if no responsibility for the shutdown can be placed on Bill
Clinton. Here's the beginning of her piece:
<P>
"To take back the House of Representatives the Democrats need
19 seats. And as of today it looks like they could win them.
Democrats are taking special aim at the Republicans elected in
1994. They're endangered in part because their leader is so
unpopular. With the help of millions of dollars from organized
labor, Democratic challengers constantly remind voters that these
freshmen supported Newt Gingrich and that together they shut down
the government...."
<P>
<a name="sandinistas">
<hr>
2) Later on Friday's World News Tonight, ABC previewed
Sunday's election in Nicaragua. Peter Jennings announced:    
"Under the heading of 'Whatever Happened To' we go to visit a man
who a decade ago was a very big thorn in the American side. The
United States sent hundreds of millions of dollars to Nicaragua
to defeat the Sandinistas and Daniel Ortega was their commander.
Ultimately the socialist programs of the Sandinistas and Mr.
Ortega fell out of favor. But there is a presidential election in
Nicaragua this Sunday and Daniel Ortega is back."
<p>
Reporter Beth Nissen found that "Daniel Ortega has changed
his tune. Literally, from militaristic Sandinista songs, to
Beethoven's Ode to Joy." And, she told viewers how "The new
Daniel is portrayed in his campaign ads as contemplative,
reverent, a man who cares deeply about the poor, a kind of Latino
Gandhi."
<p>
<a name="livingstone">
<hr>
3) In a Friday piece reviewing Wednesday night's
presidential debate, Washington Post media reporter Howard Kurtz
noted how the "average citizen" questioners didn't help Dole by
asking about Clinton's ethics. Kurtz then wrote: "If reporters had
been asking the questions, you can bet there would have been
aggressive demands to know whether Clinton planned to issue any
Whitewater pardons and who had hired Craig Livingstone and why
Dole was raising the 'character' issue and so on."
<p>
Hello. Has Kurtz been on Mars the past few weeks? Print
reporters, maybe. But which of the broadcast TV network reporters
who have yet to report the six month gap in the log book of who
accessed the FBI files, the fact that Livingstone's assistant
said he knew he was improperly obtaining Bush administration
files, and who never mentioned the pardon issue for more than a
week after Clinton raised the subject on the NewsHour, did Kurtz
expect to suddenly be interested in Clinton scandals? -- Brent
Baker

<H3>Four items today:</H3>
<p><br>
<ol>
<li><a href="#vargas">On Good Morning America, Elizabeth Vargas</a> asked Jack Kemp
about Bob Dole's hypocrisy in opposing Whitewater pardons after
having supported the pardoning of Casper Weinberger. But Vargas
and others in the media have ignored some key differences.
<li><a href="#shaw">To CNN's Bernard Shaw, raising ethics isn't a valid concern</a>
worthy of discussion. It's either an "attack" or an "insult."
<li><a href="#cbs">The co-host of CBS This Morning, however, offered</a> a
contrarian view Thursday. He suggested that the media are wrong
to consider negative campaigning off limits. 
<li><a href="#nq">The text of the October 21 edition of <I>Notable Quotables</I></a>,
jammed with the most biased quotes of the past two weeks,
including many examples of reporters calling Dole mean and
nasty.
</ol><br>
<a name=vargas>
<FONT  SIZE=+1>1)</FONT> MRC analyst Gene Eliasen caught a couple of interesting questions posed during Thursday's Good Morning America. Interviewing Jack Kemp and Leon Panetta, Elizabeth Vargas asked Kemp: 
<blockquote>"Senator Dole had pledged to keep this campaign on a
positive note. You, in your debate said yourself that negative
attacks are, quote, 'beneath Bob Dole.' Why then the decision to
launch specific, some would say negative, attacks last night?"
<br>
    Her next question: "Mr. Kemp, you do know that Senator Dole
also fought to get a pardon for Casper Weinberger several years
ago. It would seem that many, in the eyes of some, it's a bit
hypocritical to criticize the President for, for possibly
considering pardons this year."
</blockquote>
Like other reporters over the past couple of days who have
highlighted the Dole pardon hypocrisy theme, Vargas failed to
note some key differences between Weinberger and Whitewater.
Former independent counsel Lawrence Walsh raised the issue
Tuesday. But the October 16 <I>USA Today</I> noted that Walsh claimed
that Dole had "urged pardons for crimes of constitutional
dimension." Whitewater crimes hardly raise constitutional
balance of power issues. There is a difference between a
President pardoning business associates who committed crimes to
make money for themselves and a cabinet member indicted for
carrying out policies while in office.
<p>
<a name="shaw">
<FONT  SIZE=+1>2)</FONT> After Wednesday night's debate, MRC analyst Clay Waters
noticed, CNN's Bernard Shaw concluded the post-debate analysis 
by posing this question to the audience: "I only leave you with 
this question: Is a question about character and ethics a quote 
'insult,' or an 'attack'?"
<p>
<a name="cbs">
<FONT  SIZE=+1>3)</FONT> On the bright side, the media's attitude that anything
negative or critical said of Clinton is "nasty" or "harsh," was
noted by the co-host of CBS This Morning. Thursday morning
(October 17) Jose Diaz-Balart asked CBS analyst Kevin Phillips: 
<blockquote>
"It seems like everywhere else in the world, where there is
a democracy, people are allowed to talk about the other
candidate's failures as a politician. Here, it seems, that many
in the media call that name calling and personal attacks. Are we
in the media making too much of pointing out what seemed to be
just inconsistencies in a candidate?"</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"Good morning, everyone. The last debate of the national
political campaign is on tap for tonight in San Diego. Bob Dole
is not waiting for that debate to attack Bill Clinton's ethics.
With more on a campaign that is now getting meaner, NBC's Kelly
O'Donnell is standing by live in San Diego." -- Matt Lauer
leading off his October 16 Today newscast.
<p>
"Rita, true or untrue that they're preparing for a kind of
carpet bombing on character?" -- Dan Rather to Rita Braver on
what the White House faced from Bob Dole in that night's debate,
Oct. 16 Evening News.
<p>
"Was he borrowing the words of an over-enthusiastic supporter,
or did Bob Dole lower the level of civility a notch in his
contest with Bill Clinton?" -- Bernard Shaw on the "Bozo"
comment, October 8 Inside Politics.
<p>
"I know that was a major goal of the Dole campaign [in the
debate], to make sure people saw this compassionate side of Bob
Dole. Do you think that he is in some ways paying the price for
a Republican Congress that enacted, or tried to enact measures,
in the views of many were simply too harsh or too draconian?" --
Katie Couric to Elizabeth Dole, October 8 Today.
<p>
"Let me just turn to the presidential campaign very quickly. As
you've heard, Tim, it turned decidedly nastier in the Dole camp
yesterday. He was talking about a moral crisis. He refused to
answer a question if President Clinton was morally and ethically
capable of being President. You heard that Bozo exchange.
Effective strategy or is this going to come back to haunt him?"
-- Katie Couric to Tim Russert, Oct. 9 Today.
<p>
"In his harshest, most personal attack yet on the President, Bob
Dole today charged that the Clinton Administration is unethical,
that Bill Clinton himself is slipping and sliding away from
questions about possible illegal campaign contributions." -- NBC
reporter David Bloom, October 14 Nightly News.
<p>
"Senator Dole said he wasn't going to mention Whitewater, then
Whitewater did rear its ugly head last night." -- CBS This
Morning co-host Mark McEwen to Fred Barnes the morning after
the first debate, Oct. 7.

<CENTER><FONT  SIZE=+1><b>Phil Jones: CBS Hatchet Man</b></FONT></CENTER>
<blockquote>
"He's got to explain how his campaign centerpiece, the 15
percent tax cut, can be paid for without draconian cuts in
social programs. He wants to talk about the character issue, but
he can't get personal or look mean-spirited doing it." -- Phil
Jones on what Dole needed to do in the upcoming debate, October
4 CBS Evening News.
<p>
"I think that if I had to say probably where he was the weakest
and where he really needed to score was, he needed to explain to
the American people how this country can afford that 15 percent
tax cut, the centerpiece of his campaign, without these
draconian cuts. I don't think he has done that yet." -- Reporter
Phil Jones on CBS after the October 6 debate.
<p>
"It's a tough speech for him to make because he runs the risk of
looking desperate and mean-spirited." -- Phil Jones on Dole
raising Clinton's "public ethics," October 15 CBS Evening News.
<p>
"Attacking the President could be risky for Mr. Dole because of
the debate format. The candidates will be facing voters who are
asking the questions, not a reporter. Mr. Dole has never been
able to shed that image of a hatchet man that he got back in his
1976 vice presidential debate and the last thing he needs
tonight is a boo, a hiss, or a gasp from one of the questioners
who thinks he's being too mean." -- Phil Jones, October 16 CBS
Evening News.

<CENTER><FONT  SIZE=+1><b>Characterwise, It's Clinton Over Reagan</b></FONT></CENTER>
<blockquote>
"In the first two years this is a man [Clinton] who tried his
best to balance the budget, to reform health care, to fight for
gay rights, to support personal freedoms. Couldn't those be
considered doing the right things, evidence of true character?"
-- Bryant Gumbel to David Maraniss, MSNBC's InterNight, October
10.
<p>
"Lou, I know you feel as if Reagan had few, if any, character
flaws. But let me ask you this. When one sidesteps, or refuses
to acknowledge the consequences of their policies or actions,
why shouldn't that be viewed as a character flaw? Or when one
lies. For example, let me roll a clip and then we'll come back.
This one deals with Iran-Contra." -- Gumbel to Washington Post
reporter Lou Cannon, same show.
<p>
"While he appeared to be empathetic, his policies caused
enormous suffering for those who were least able to afford it?"
-- Gumbel to Cannon in discussion about Ronald Reagan, same
show.
<p>
"Elections, like actions, have consequences. Sometimes it's hard
to know what they might be. Did Americans know that electing
Ronald Reagan would send the deficit through the roof? Do we
know that electing Bob Dole would lessen drug use?" -- CNN
reporter Bruce Morton on Late Edition, September 29.

<CENTER><FONT  SIZE=+1><b>Hateful Hunt Hates Conservatives, Loves Liberals</b></FONT></CENTER>
<blockquote>
"I think North Carolina is a test in the great divide in the
Republican conservative movement. There's the politics of hope
personified by Jack Kemp and there's the politics of hate
personified by Jesse Helms." -- Wall Street Journal Executive
Washington Editor Al Hunt, October 5 Capital Gang on CNN.
<p>
"Kenneth Starr, the supposedly non-partisan independent counsel
investigating the Clintons, was the featured speaker yesterday
at a luncheon sponsored by right wing hatemonger Pat Robertson
[who runs the] Christian Broadcasting Network and Regent Law
School. By pandering to Clinton-haters, Mr. Starr appears to be
abandoning all pretenses of impartiality. He went into this job
with a reputation as a fair-minded conservative. He now looks
more like a political hit man desperately eager for a future
Supreme Court appointment." -- Al Hunt's Outrage of the Week,
October 5 Capital Gang.
<p>
"Whatever you thought of Jimmy Carter as President, he has been
a great ex-President, helping to avoid bloodshed from North
Korea to Haiti, bringing health care to children in Africa and
Latin America. Even Bob Novak has lauded some of these efforts.
The outrage? The Nobel Peace prize for years has given President
Carter the back of its hand. It can make amends next week and
give him what he deserves: the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize." -- Al
Hunt, September 28 Capital Gang.

<CENTER><FONT  SIZE=+1><b>Can't Tell What Peter Thinks</b></FONT></CENTER>

"There was a study released at Penn State University today that
you may hear a lot about this weekend. It purports to show a
connection between women who have had abortions and the risk of
developing breast cancer. And if you see it around, remember
this. It is not original research, but an analysis of 23 earlier
studies. And the National Cancer Institute says those individual
studies were actually inconclusive, and because of that, various
other scientists say today the Penn State report is flawed." --
Peter Jennings "reporting" a study which appeared in the Journal
of Epidemiology and Community Health showing that abortion is
responsible for 5,000 cases of breast cancer each year, October
11 World News Tonight.

"I was watching his acceptance speech in San Diego, which was
really the speech of his life, it was a very dramatic event. And
I'm standing there with one of our younger producers at MSNBC.
She's 24 or something and I said `What do you think?' She said,
`You know, he scares me.' And I said, `What do you mean he
scares you?' She said `It doesn't matter what he's trying to
say, it doesn't matter what the speech says or how well he's
doing it, all I hear him say is GET OFF MY LAWN! I have this
mental image. I'm playing with my friends on the rich guy's lawn
and the guy comes to the door, with his little pen, you know,

<p>
<li><FONT  SIZE=-1>But first, a quick correction: The quote from the CBS
Evening News cited in yesterday's CyberAlert was incorrectly
attributed to Bill Plante. In fact, the quote came from Phil
Jones.</FONT>
<ol>
<li><a href="#worried">Before Wednesday night's debate reporters worried</a> about
Dole's more aggressive plan. NBC's Matt Lauer said it meant the
campaign "is now getting meaner." On CBS, Phil Jones worried
that in a "town meeting" format, Dole may be seen as "being too
mean." Dan Rather warned that Dole planned to unload a "carpet
bombing on character."
<li><a href="#face">On Face the Nation, Bob Schieffer asked</a> if Dole's tax cut
proposal is responsible for "the economic mess that the country
is in."
<li><a href="#quiz">A quiz question</a>: A man identified as a "Democratic
strategist" has been making the rounds of TV shows to provide
the pro-Clinton spin. He is married to which network
correspondent who is covering the Clinton campaign?
</ol><br>
<a name="worried">
<FONT  SIZE=+1>1)</FONT> Today show news anchor Matt Lauer opened the 7am
newscast on Wednesday (October 16) by blaming Dole for causing a
mean campaign. As transcribed by MRC analyst Geoffrey Dickens:
"Good morning everyone. The last debate of the national
political campaign is on tap for tonight in San Diego. Bob Dole
is not waiting for that debate to attack Bill Clinton's ethics.
With more on a campaign that is now getting meaner, NBC's Kelly
O'Donnell is standing by live in San Diego."
<p>
On Wednesday's CBS Evening News, reporter Phil Jones showed
a clip of him shouting questions about debate strategy at Bob
Dole as Dole got into his car:
<blockquote>
   Phil Jones: "Ethics?"<BR>
   Dole: "Maybe."<BR>
   Jones: "Do you worry about it backfiring if you get into that?"<BR>
   Dole shook his head, and Jones then explained:<p>
   "Well, attacking the President could be risky for Mr. Dole
because of the debate format. The candidates will be facing
voters who are asking the questions, not a reporter. Mr. Dole
has never been able to shed that image of a hatchet man that he
got back in his 1976 vice presidential debate and the last thing
he needs tonight is a boo, a hiss, or a gasp from one of the
questioners who thinks he's being too mean."
</blockquote>
Introducing the next story from Rita Braver on the Clinton
beat, Rather asked: "Rita, true or untrue that they're preparing
for a kind of carpet bombing on character?"
<p>
<a name="face">
<FONT  SIZE=+1>2)</FONT> Most analysts suggest that Dole's 15 percent tax cut
plan has not been a more effective campaign issue because people
don't believe he'll follow through. Not Bob Schieffer. He thinks
Dole's problem is that people believe he's committed to the
supply-side theory behind the plan. 
<p>
    On the October 6 Face the Nation, Schieffer asked Ross
Perot: "You mentioned the economic mess that the country is in.
The keystone of the Dole campaign at this point seems to be a 15
percent across the board tax cut. That seems to go against a lot
of the things that Senator Dole has said in the past. I know
that you personally would not have gone in that direction. But
do you think that is one of the reasons that the Dole campaign
is running behind as it is now? What do you think of the 15
percent tax cut? Is it at all realistic? Could that be done?"
<p>
<a name="quiz">
<FONT  SIZE=+1>3)</FONT> Quiz answer: Rita Braver, the White House correspondent for
CBS News. Her husband: Bob Barnett, a Washington lawyer who
played George Bush in mock debates with Bill Clinton in 1992. In
addition to Clinton, he served as a debate coach for Michael
Dukakis and Walter Mondale. Wednesday night he appeared on CNN
both before and after the debate, identified on screen as a
"Democratic strategist."
<p>
How convenient. Rita Braver gets the Clinton spin at work
and at home.

   <FONT SIZE=+2> 2)</FONT> For the Monday, October 14 World News Tonight, Peter
Jennings and crew traveled to Detroit. They found a booming city
and reported that under Clinton America's cities are on the
rebound. Here's the introduction and beginning of their story of
the state of cities this election year:
<blockquote>
Peter Jennings: "Here in Detroit itself we've noticed a
difference. It was impossible to come here in years past without
the state of the city itself being an issue. Not this year, not
here. And as ABC's Dean Reynolds reports tonight, not in many
other places as well."</blockquote>
<P>
Dean Reynolds, over video of a building being torn down: 
<blockquote>
"In Detroit this morning it was down with the old. Down with the
high-rise symbols of urban rot to be replaced by new
neighborhoods. Twenty five housing developments have started
here since the Clinton Administration took office."
Mayor Dennis Archer: "There is a sense that there is a
relationship between the city of Detroit and Washington and that
it is positive."
<P>
Reynolds: "A decade ago during the Reagan era, according to the
Mayor, only one new house was built in the entire city."
</blockquote>
<P>
<BR>

<P>
<BR>
    <FONT SIZE=+2> 3)</FONT> For the October 6 Sunday Morning, CBS reporter Jerry
Bowen examined some hot House contests. As transcribed by MRC
analyst Steve Kaminski, here's how Bowen described the choice
voters face in a California district:
<blockquote>
    Jerry Bowen: "In the 22nd District along California's
central coast, freshman incumbent Andrea Seastrand is in the
fight of her political life. Challenged again by Democrat Walter
Capps, the college professor she defeated by less than 1 percent
of the vote last time. It is a contest of stark contrasts. The
55 year-old Seastrand: ultra-conservative, pro-life, pro-assault
weapons, anti-gay, anti-illegal immigrant."
<P>
</blockquote>
    After a soundbite from Republican Seastrand, Bowen continued: 
<P>
<blockquote>
"The soft spoken 62 year-old Capps, liberal down the line: abortion
rights, gay rights, gun control, opposed to the death penalty."
</blockquote>
<P>
    Has CBS ever come across an "ultra-liberal"?

<p>
<H3>Four items today:</H3>
<P>
<OL>
<LI><a href="#correction">A correction</a> and a clarification of previous MRC CyberAlerts. Plus, a fact checking error from ABC on Jack Kemp. 
<LI><a href="#flawed">A study shows a link between abortion and breast cancer,</a> but instead of giving equal time to study proponents and opponents, ABC declares it "flawed."
<LI><a href="#clinton">Thanks to Bill Clinton,</a> the President of CBS Entertainment relays, a father will be able to say good-bye to his dying daughter -- and you'll be able to see it in a prime time movie.
<LI><a href="#dole">NBC's David Bloom says Bob Dole issued his "harshest, most personal attack yet on the President."</a> ABC's John Donvan asked and answers: "Did Bob Dole attack Bill Clinton in harsh terms today? Yes he did. Plenty." Donvan concludes that by not getting too personal Dole may lose, but that's okay since "it lets the candidate play out this possibly climatic moment in his career more like a statesman, less like a nasty politician."  
</OL>
<a name="correction">
<H3>1) A clarification and a correction of two topics from MRC CyberAlerts from last week.</H3>
<P>
First, the October 8 CyberAlert reported that on Monday night
(October 7) ABC's World News Tonight and the CBS Evening News ran
fact check stories on the Dole-Clinton debate. In fact, CBS
Evening News did, but ABC's piece aired on Good Morning America,
not World News Tonight. In addition, CNN's Brooks Jackson did a
fact check piece for Inside Politics.
<P>
Second, the October 11 CyberAlert noted that unlike in 1992,
this year neither ABC's World News Tonight or CNN's Inside
Politics ran fact checking stories on the VP debate. That's
correct, but MRC analyst Gene Eliasen pointed out to me that
ABC's Good Morning America did run one Thursday morning.
<P>
<DD>ABC reporter Jack Smith asserted: "Both men indicated that
taxes are too high, right? But federal taxes as a portion of
household income are actually lower now than they were 15 years
ago. Kemp made this assertion."
<BR>
<DD>Jack Kemp: "Every time in this century we've lowered the tax
rates across the board revenues went up, not down."
<BR>
<DD>Smith: "Wrong again. The last time this was tried, in 1981,
real income tax revenues fell three years in a row and drove up
the deficit."
<P>
Reality Check: Following the 1982 recession, income tax
revenue grew consistently. As Norman Ture pointed out in Ed
Rubenstein's book The Right Data, "With the recovery beginning in
late 1982, budget receipts expanded rapidly, on the average by
slightly over 8 percent a year, through fiscal 1990."
<P>
<a name="flawed">
<H3>2) On Friday, a study appearing in the Journal of
Epidemiology and Community Health, was released.</H3> It showed that
abortion is responsible for 5,000 cases of breast cancer each
year. ABC's Peter Jennings Friday night (October 11) delivered
not a news report but a warning:
<P>
<DD>Peter Jennings: "There was a study released at Penn State
University today that you may hear a lot about this weekend. It
purports to show a connection between women who have had
abortions and the risk of developing breast cancer. And if you
see it around, remember this. It is not original research, but an
analysis of 23 earlier studies. And the National Cancer Institute
says those individual studies were actually inconclusive, and
because of that, various other scientists say today the Penn
State report is flawed."
<P>
Jennings did not have to worry: While on CNN's The World
Today Jeff Levine provided a full report about the study and its
critics, neither CBS Evening News or NBC Nightly News even
mentioned the study.
<P>
<a name="clinton">
<H3>3) CBS has turned a self-serving Clinton anecdote into a 
prime time movie.</H3> Here's an exchange from Friday's Late, Late
Show with Tom Snyder:
<P>
<DD>Les Moonves, CBS entertainment division President: "The President
did actually pitch me a movie of the week idea which we ended up
shooting....It's unusual when the President of the United States
pitches you, actually a wonderful movie of the week."
<BR>
<DD>Tom Snyder: "What was it, a young guy from Arkansas becomes
President?"
<BR>
<DD>Moonves: "No, it was about the Family and Medical Leave Act, a
true story that he was involved in where a young girl had visited
the White House. He'd come back from his morning jog, and this 13
year old girl was there in a wheelchair. The President went over
to her and she evidently was dying of leukemia and the father
went over to him and thanked the President for having passed the
Family and Medical Leave Act so he could be with his daughter.
She was going to die, but at least he could say good-bye. As the
President pitched it, I mean, he had tears in his eyes,
legitimately. It was very moving. We ended up shooting the movie
starring John Ritter as the father and the President appears in
it as himself."
<BR>
<DD>Snyder: "You will stop at nothing."
<BR>
<DD>Moonves: "I will. I'm shameless for ratings, what can I tell you.
But we're not allowed to show it until after the elections."
<P>
To get to the truth of the anecdote, do we divide by six or by two?
<P>
<a name="dole">
<H3>4) In the media lexicon, anything about character or illegality is harsh and/or nasty.<BR></H3>
 Two examples:
<BR>
<DD>Monday night (October 14) this is how David Bloom began his
NBC Nightly News story: "In his harshest, most personal attack
yet on the President, Bob Dole today charged that the Clinton
Administration is unethical, that Bill Clinton himself is
slipping and sliding away from questions about possible illegal
campaign contributions."
<BR>
<DD>The night before, on ABC's World News Sunday, anchor Carole
Simpson asked: "The candidates are back on the road, but will
they take the high road or the low road?"
<BR>
<DD>Reporter John Donvan observed: "Did Bob Dole attack Bill
Clinton in harsh terms today? Yes he did. Plenty."
<BR>
<DD>Dole: "Drug use has doubled because nothing has been done in
this administration. He's been AWOL. He's been AWOL before, but
now he's really been AWOL now."
<BR>
<DD>Donvan: "But did Dole get personal, dig into the President's
past, stir up the mud of Whitewater and other issues of
character? No, he isn't. And despite being urged to do so by some
members of his own party. Dole in person is still taking the high
road, hitting the President hard on his record but not going
after Clinton on his personal life and moral character. Some in
Dole's camp wish that he'd get nastier at this point with polls
delivering constant bad news to the campaign."
<P>
Following a clip of Dole saying he's "thinking about" being
tougher and a soundbite from Jack Kemp, Donvan concluded his
story: "Dole himself continues to be the gentleman on the stump.
That may make for a duller campaign than some would like, and
perhaps a losing one. But it lets the candidate play out this
possibly climatic moment in his career more like a statesman,
less like a nasty politician. John Donvan, ABC News, Hamilton New
Jersey."
<P>
Just what reporters want. Dole to lose while not damaging Clinton.

<p>
<br>
<a name="conservative">
<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size=+2>1)</font>On Thursday's CBS Evening News, reporter Phil Jones
concluded his piece on the Dole campaign with a conservative spin
on Kemp's debate performance: 
    "In private, off the record discussions, with both Dole and
Kemp aides there's a strong sense of disappointment in Kemp's
debate performance. They talk about missed opportunities, the
feeling that Kemp let the Vice President take credit for issues
like welfare reform. As one Dole aide asked cynically, 'Did he
study much?'"
<P>
<br>
<a name="extreme">
<P>
<br>
<br>
<font size=+2>2)</font>)Later in the October 10 CBS broadcast, Bob Schieffer
traveled to Ohio's 6th CD which encompasses the southern part of
the Buckeye state. For the House seat, Republican freshman Frank
Cremeans faces his 1994 opponent, Democrat Ted Strickland.
Schieffer stated as fact that the Republican House shut the
government down, ignoring the at least equal role of the
President in refusing to sign continuing resolutions or
appropriation bills. 
<P>
    Here's the second half of the story:
<P>
Schieffer: "Now the two are back for a re-match that typifies the
predicament many Republican freshmen are finding. The revolution
and its talk of changing things like Medicare backfired with some
voters. Just ask the Republican county chairman here."<br>
Roger Bennett, Clinton County Republican Chairman: "I think
they've lost confidence in Newt Gingrich."<br>
Schieffer: "Remember, he's the Republican, not the Democratic
chairman. Why is that? Did you just go too far?"<br>
Bennett: "I think he went too far and I think if you make a
mistake you back up and say, 'darn it I made a mistake,' and you
go back and do it over again the right way."<br>
Schieffer: "Where did he make the mistake? In shutting down the
government."<br>
Bennett: "I think that is the big thing because it involved all
the older people They were really concerned. It scared the
Dickens out of them."<br>
<P>
<br>
   Having established the GOP as the culprits for the shutdown,
Schieffer concluded by endorsing the Democratic candidate's view
that House Republicans are extremists:
<br>
Schieffer: "One reason Republican Cremeans, a Gingrich stalwart
in Washington, stresses the local angle here. Is your opponent
running against Newt Gingrich or is he running against you.
Cremeans: "Well, you'd have to ask him that. What I've tried to
do is represent the district."<br>
Schieffer: "For sure, his opponent promises the same. He's
learned a lesson too."<br>
Strickland: "And that lesson is that people want moderation and
when extremes are presented, whether they be from the left or
from the right, I think people have a tendency to turn away from
that."<br>
Schieffer: "Obvious perhaps, but as Fall comes to the heartland
and the election draws near, dozens of Republican freshmen are
running scared, wondering if it's a lesson they learned in time.
Bob Schieffer, CBS News, Chillicothe Ohio."<br>
<P>
<br>
<a name="fact">
<P>
<br>
<br>
 <font size=+2> 3)</font> After the 1992 VP debate, both ABC's World News Tonight
and CNN's Inside Politics ran fact checking stories which were
dominating by corrections of Dan Quayle. This year, The
Washington Post ran a piece October 10 citing errors made by Kemp
and Gore. The Post identified five errors made by Gore. But, this
year neither ABC or CNN ran a reality check piece.
<P>
    Of course, you can't always trust the fact checkers. Post
reporter Michael Weisskopf offered this "correction" on Kemp:
"Kemp...defended the tax proposal by arguing that every tax cut
in the 20th century has produced higher government revenue. But
many economists disagree. The huge Reagan tax cut in 1981
resulted in a tripling of the budget deficit over a dozen years."
<P>
   Talk about apples and oranges. Taxes were cut, but as the
numbers show, tax revenue grew faster than inflation in the
1980s. Spending soared even faster, leading to higher deficits.
<P>
<br>
<a name="pbs">
<P>
<br>
<font size=+2>4) </font> Speaking of Reagan bashing, MRC associate editor Tim
Graham caught some in Tuesday night's PBS Frontline special, The
'96 Choice. Actress Blair Brown, who narrated the show, stated:
"By 1985, Reagan's economics had plunged the country into debt.
Dole's all-out fight to lower the deficit became the defining
battle of his career."
<P>
<br>
<a name="night">
<P>
<br>
<br>
   <font size=+2>5) </font> With several presidential biographers as guests, on
Thursday's (October 10) MSNBC InterNight Bryant Gumbel explored
presidential character. Much of the show was devoted to defending 
Bill Clinton's character. Here are a few of Gumbel's questions:
<blockquote>
    -- Talking about Clinton, Gumbel asked The Washington Post's
David Maraniss: "In the first two years this is a man who tried
his best to balance the budget, to reform health care, to fight
for gay rights, to support personal freedoms. Couldn't those be
considered doing the right things, evidence of true character?"
</blockquote>
<P>
    He tried to balanced the budget?
<P>
  <blockquote>  -- "Do any of those things of which Bill Clinton is charged,
when it comes to character, have much to do with governing
effectively, or with leading?"
</blockquote>
<P>
    Having failed to mention anything about lying and Clinton,
Gumbel moved on to Reagan.
<P>
<blockquote>    -- To Reagan biographer Lou Cannon: "Lou, I know you feel as
if Reagan had few, if any, character flaws. But let me ask you
this. When one sidesteps, or refuses to acknowledge the
consequences of their policies or actions, why shouldn't that be
viewed as a character flaw? Or when one lies. For example, let me
roll a clip and then we'll come back. This one deals with Iran-Contra."
</blockquote>
<P>
<blockquote>
    -- A segment later, he returned to Reagan, asking Cannon if
it was true "that while he appeared to be empathetic, his
policies caused enormous suffering for those who were least able
to afford it?"
</blockquote>
<P>
<br>
<a name="bob">
<P>
<br>
<br>
 <font size=+2>6)</font> Appearing on NBC's Tonight Show Thursday night (October
10), NBC and MSNBC reporter/anchor Brian Williams told Jay Leno
the following anecdote (ALL CAPS = Williams impersonating Bob
Dole yelling):
<blockquote>
   Brian Williams: "I was watching his acceptance speech in San
Diego, which was really the speech of his life, it was a very
dramatic event. And I'm standing there with one of our younger
producers at MSNBC. She's 24 or something and I said 'What do you
think?' She said, 'You know, he scares me.' And I said, 'What do
you mean he scares you?' She said 'It doesn't matter what he's
trying to say, it doesn't matter what the speech says or how well
he's doing it, all I hear him say is GET OFF MY LAWN! I have this
mental image. I'm playing with my friends on the rich guy's lawn
and the guy comes to the door, with his little pen, you know, and
says GET OFF MY LAWN!'" 
</blockquote>
<P>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    Talk about image over substance. And not much sensitivity toward
the disabled. 
<P>

<LI><a href="#bozo">Dole's reaction to a man in a crowd calling Bill Clinton "Bozo"</a> generated media condemnation on Wednesday. Boston Globe and USA Today stories portrayed Bozo as part of a grand strategy. On Today, Katie Couric charged that the campaign "turned decidedly nastier in the Dole camp yesterday" and she blamed "the right wing" for his new strategy.

</OL>
<P>
<a name="bozo">
<B>1)</B> On Tuesday a man in a crowd yelled at Dole "Please
get Bozo out of the White House." Dole shot back: "Bozo's on
his way out." But to believe some media reports you'd think
Dole set out Tuesday to launch a new campaign strategy based
upon insulting Clinton. 
<P>
Here's the headline in the Wednesday, October 9 Boston
Globe: <I>"Dole Goes On Attack, Calls Clinton 'Bozo.'"</i> The
subhead: <I>"Comment Draws White House Retort."</I> 
<P>
USA Today's headline declared: <I>"Dole Quips That He'll
Beat 'Bozo.'"</I> The lead of Judy Keen's story: <I>"Bob Dole
politely called his rival 'Mr. President' during Sunday's
presidential debate. But on Tuesday, he referred to him as
'Bozo.'"</I>
<P>
On Wednesday morning's Today Katie Couric talked with
Tim Russert. Here's part of their discussion, as transcribed
by MRC analyst Geoffrey Dickens: 
<BR>
<DD>Couric: "Let me just turn to the presidential campaign
very quickly. As you've heard Tim it turned decidedly
nastier in the Dole camp yesterday. He was talking about a
moral crisis. He refused to answer a question if President
Clinton was morally and ethically capable of being
President. You heard that bozo exchange. Effective strategy
or is this going to come back to haunt him?"
<BR>
<DD>Tim Russert: "I don't think it's an effective strategy.
I was rather surprised. I think Senator Dole was very
effective Sunday night in raising his favorable rating with
the American people. He didn't move many votes but at least
he was looked at in a much more favorable light with his
sense of humor and quickness."
<BR>
<DD>Katie Couric: "But the right wing thought he wasn't
aggressive enough?"
<BR>
<DD>Tim Russert: "Well obviously he's responding to that
criticism and what he's saying is, 'My God, I haven't
reached 40 percent in the polls yet! I have 20 percent of
the Republican party still not voting for me. The only way
to get to them is by being more aggressive and negative on
Clinton.' The problem is Katie when you do that, what you do
is say to a large amount of women, the so-called gender gap,
they don't like that. And they have said repeatedly they
want a more positive campaign. It's a very risky, very risky
venture by Senator Dole."
<P>
<a name="soft">
<B>2)</B> Meanwhile, Al Gore gets a little nicer treatment.
Later on Wednesday, Today aired an interview with the Vice
President caught by MRC analyst Geoffrey Dickens. Here are
all the "questions" posed by Ed Gordon (a frequent host of
MSNBC's InterNight).
<P>
<DD>-- "Many can see that you have indeed been the most
powerful Vice President in our history. You satisfied with
the role that you played for four years?"
<BR>
<DD>-- "The debate is coming up. What do you want people to
come away with, after they watch you and Jack Kemp? What
should they know about Al Gore?"
<BR>
<DD>-- "Biggest difference between you and Jack Kemp?"
<BR>
<DD>-- "You want to be the best second guy you can. You're
there to help the President. Now having said that, do you
want the job in 2000?"
<BR>
<DD>-- "Any concerns that you all are overconfident with the
lead that the polls show and is there any concern that
because the lead is so large you might not be able to use
your coattails to usher in people into the House and the
Senate?"
<P>
Five questions, but Gordon couldn't squeeze in an
inquiry about Al Gore's hypocritical tobacco speech at the
Democratic convention.
<P>
<a name="race">
<B>3)</B> Speaking of sucking up to the VP, ever since a pro-Bush
independent expenditure campaign in 1988 highlighted
the Dukakis furlough of Willie Horton, for the media
Horton symbolized how the GOP "plays the race card."
Conservatives regularly pointed out, to no avail, how Gore
first raised the issue in a 1988 primary debate.
<P>
But in a story for CNN's AllPolitics.com Web site two
CNN reporters on Tuesday cited Gore's question not as an
example of racial politics but as a sign of Gore's
toughness. MRC analyst Steve Kaminski noticed the following
sentence in a VP debate preview story by CNN reporters Marc
Watts and Bob Franken:
<P>
<DD>"Gore can also fire off the tough question. In 1988, as
a Senator, he first raised what became known as the 'Willie
Horton issue' with Michael Dukakis during a primary debate."
<P>
In a February 13, 1992 CNN special on race and the
campaign, MRC associate editor Tim Graham reminded me, Ken
Bode placed all the onus on the GOP: "David Duke's
exploitation of white working class fears about blacks
echoes a theme from the 1988 election. This is the Maryland
State Penitentiary. Inside resides the most politically
notorious convict in America. William Horton, Jr., the focal
point of a major national campaign designed to exploit white
fear of black crime....The Horton case illustrates the
readiness of political leaders to exploit the racial
divide."
<P>
<a name="engberg">
<B>4)</B> Monday's CBS Evening News (October 7) included a
"Reality Check" segment by Eric Engberg on facts asserted
during Sunday's debate. Here's a piece of the story:
<P>
<DD>Eric Engberg: "Some facts got mangled."<BR>
<DD>Dole: "For the first time in history, you pay about 40
percent of what you earn, more than you spend for food,
clothing and shelter combined, for taxes under this
administration."<BR>
<DD>Engberg: "Exaggeration. The most recent government study
says the average household spends $16,000 on the basics, and
only $6,000 on all taxes, including state and local taxes
outside the President's control."<BR>
<P>
As Engberg would say, TIME OUT! On Tuesday the Tax
Foundation released a report showing Dole was correct and
Engberg was wrong. The Tax Foundation discovered that the
government report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics
"greatly understates taxes paid....Among the omissions, the
survey does not list the employee's share of Social Security
tax payments among taxes paid....Similarly, the BLS survey
does not report sales and excise taxes paid....Just as
important, the BLS survey results altogether ignore the
effect of indirect levies, such as business taxes, on
American households."
<P>
Factoring in all these taxes, the Tax Foundation
calculated that for households from $22,500 to $750,000
plus, taxes took a larger bite than the total for food,
clothing, and housing. The Tax Foundation found that
households in the $45,000 to $60,0000 category spent $16,000
as Engberg said on "the basics," but had a $25,000 tax burden.

We need a Reality Check for the CBS Reality Check.

<LI>On Tuesday<a href="#Dole"> Bob Dole</a> responded positively to a supporter in a crowd who yelled "Get the bozo out of the White House." The ABC and NBC evening shows focused on the remark as CNN's Bernard Shaw  wondered "Did Bob Dole lower the level of civility a notch?" 
<LI>Instead of exploring<a href="#FBI"> FBI file revelations and Whitewater,</a> the host of This Morning on CBS complained about how "Whitewater did rear its ugly head" during the debate. 
<LI><a href="#scandal">Clinton scandals</a> may not interest reporters, but Newt Gingrich had to answer six questions in a row about his ethics situation. On NBC's Today Matt Lauer asked whether he's "been completely forthright and truthful in providing information" to the House ethics committee and if he'll be forced to resign. 
<LI>Katie Couric asked<a href="#liddy"> Elizabeth Dole</a> whether Bob Dole is paying the price for a Republican Congress which was "simply too harsh or too draconian."

<a name="Dole">
<FONT SIZE=+2>1</FONT>) On Tuesday night (October 8) ABC's World News Tonight
and NBC Nightly News aired stories on the big spending by labor
unions to defeat freshmen Republicans. The CBS Evening News and
ABC's World News Tonight featured pieces with clips of their
correspondent interviewing Bob Dole on his bus.
<BR>
<DD>
The big news of the day: Bozo. A man in a crowd yelled at
Dole that he should get bozo out of the White House. Dole shot
back: "Bozo's on his way out."
<P>
CNN's Bernard Shaw opened Inside Politics: "Was he borrowing
the words of an over-enthusiastic supporter, or did Bob Dole
lower the level of civility a notch in his contest with Bill
Clinton?"
<P>
On World News Tonight, ABC's John Cochran began his piece:
"Under pressure from critics in his own party to get personal
with the President, today Dole said he's ready to do just that.
In a series of interviews Dole admitted he was too soft on the
President in their first debate, especially on White House access
to FBI files on well-known Republicans...."
<P>
Noting that Dole failed to demand that Clinton promise not
the pardon those involved in Whitewater, Cochran ran a clip of
Dole explaining: "It would seem to me, particularly in the first
debate, when there's this myth out there about the mean Bob Dole,
if I'd done anything that even appeared to be stepping over the
line, that would have been the story."
<P>
Cochran continued: "That was exactly what happened today when
a supporter asked Dole to please get the bozo out of the White
House. Dole said bozo's on his way out."
<P>
Of course, Cochran made it the story. He didn't have to. The
CBS Evening News didn't mention the exchange.
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<a name="FBI">
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>2</FONT>) Cochran didn't use Dole's admission that he went too
easy on Clinton on the FBI files as an opportunity to report how
an aide to Craig Livingstone had contradicted his story. But he's
not the only reporter with an aversion to Clinton scandals. On
Monday's This Morning (October 7) Mark McEwen discussed the
debate with Bob Beckel and Fred Barnes. McEwen told Barnes:
"Senator Dole said he wasn't going to mention Whitewater, then
Whitewater did rear its ugly head last night."
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<a name="scandal">
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>3</FONT>) NBC's Today has also failed to report anything on the
deposition from Craig Livingstone's aide (see October 6
CyberAlert for details). But, on Tuesday morning Today's Matt
Lauer repeatedly pressed Newt Gingrich about his ethics case. 
<BR>
<DD>
Lauer asked Gingrich seven questions about the debate and why
he's so unpopular, then fired six questions about Gingrich and
the ethics committee. Here are the last six question posed by
Lauer in his October 8 interview with Gingrich:

<blockquote> "Are you completely sure, Mr. Speaker, that you have been
completely forthright and truthful in providing information to
this committee?"<BR>
<DD>"But wouldn't it seem somewhat obvious that there must be
something that's disturbing or distressing them completely. Why
would Republicans, on the subcommittee, vote to expand the
investigation if they haven't found something that disturbs even
them?"<BR>
<DD>"But can you think of a logical reason why they would do
that?"<BR>
<DD>"Do you envision any circumstances, Mr. Speaker, under
which you might be forced to resign based on this investigation?"<BR>
<DD>"So if the ethics committee comes back and says Newt
Gingrich was not truthful with us in supplying information?"<BR>
<DD>Gingrich: "I don't think they can say that."<BR>
<DD> "If they did, would you consider resigning?"<BR>
<P>
<BR>
</blockquote>
<a name="liddy">
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>4)</FONT> In the next hour on Tuesday's Today, Katie Couric talked
with Elizabeth Dole. One of Couric's questions:
<blockquote>
"I know that was a major goal of the Dole campaign [in
debate], to make sure people saw this compassionate side of Bob
Dole. Do you think that he is in some ways paying the price for a
Republican Congress that enacted, or tried to enact measures, in
the views of many were simply too harsh or too draconian?" 

</blockquote>
<P>
<BR>
Maybe he's just paying the price for a biased media.

<li><a href="#moderate">By sticking to a moderate course in the debate</a> and
avoiding scandal topics that would enrage the media, Bob
Dole largely avoided media condemnation and earned praise
for his humor. But, not from everyone. NBC's Lisa Myers
tagged him as "harsh," CBS reporter Phil Jones said Dole
failed to explain how we can "afford" his tax cut and CNN's
Judy Woodruff asked Al Gore if Dole was "too negative."
<li><a href="#hunt">This past weekend Al Hunt labeled three conservatives</a>

<a name=moderate>
<FONT  SIZE=+2>1)</FONT> In an amazing break out of balance, Monday night
both ABC's World News Tonight and the CBS Evening News ran
post-debate "fact check" stories that took on assertions
made in Sunday night's debate by both Dole and Clinton.
<p>
In post-debate banter, Bob Dole largely avoided condemnations
for being too negative or too harsh, but there were some exceptions:
<p>
-- On Monday's Today (October 7) NBC's Lisa Myers raised
the "harsh" theme. Here's the quote caught by MRC analyst
Geoffrey Dickens: 
<blockquote>"I think he was strongest when he talked about his
proposals, tax cuts, opportunity scholarships for poor
children. He showed the wit and humor that those of us who
have covered Bob Dole know. The problem, I think, is that he
may have been a little bit harsh at times and that I don't
think that he really did enough to bring home a lot of
undecided voters."</blockquote>
-- During a special midnight (ET) Inside Politics after
the debate CNN brought on Jack Kemp and Al Gore. CNN's
Bernard Shaw did not ask Kemp negative questions about Bill
Clinton's performance, but Judy Woodruff did pose two such
questions to Al Gore about Bob Dole. As transcribed by MRC 
analyst Clay Waters, here are two of her inquiries:<blockquote>
<EM>Woodruff:</EM> "Bob Dole, as I mentioned a moment ago, among
other things, repeatedly again referred to the President as
being liberal. I mean, just, it seemed to come up throughout
the debate. Do you think the President was able to adequately
respond to what has apparently become a negative label?"<br>
<EM>Al Gore responded:</EM> "I think the American people want to
hear about ideas and don't want to hear candidates insulting
each other and hurling accusations and personal charges."<br>
<EM>To which Woodruff asked:</EM>"Well, do you think Bob Dole
was too negative tonight?"</blockquote>
-- Minutes after the debated ended, reporter Phil Jones
made it clear he was not satisfied with Dole's performance.
MRC analyst Steve Kaminski took down his reaction:
<blockquote>
    "I think that if I had to say probably where he was the
weakest and where he really needed to score was, he needed
to explain to the American people how this country can
afford that 15 percent tax cut, the centerpiece of his
campaign, without these draconian cuts. I don't think he has
done that yet."</blockquote>

<a name=hunt>
<FONT  SIZE=+2>2)</FONT> In Sunday's CyberAlert I reported how on Saturday's
CNN Capital Gang Al Hunt, Executive Washington Editor of the
Wall Street Journal, had disparaged three conservatives. He
said Jesse Helms represented "hate," Pat Robertson was a
"hatemonger" and Woody Jenkins was an "extremist."
<p>
MRC analyst Clay Waters reminded me of what Hunt uttered
the week before, on the September 28 Capital Gang:
<blockquote>
"Whatever you thought of Jimmy Carter as President, he
has been a great ex-President, helping to avoid bloodshed
from North Korea to Haiti, bringing health care to children
in Africa and Latin America. Even Bob Novak has lauded some
of these efforts. The outrage? The Nobel Peace prize for
years has given President Carter the back of its hand. It
can make amends next week and give him what he deserves: the
1996 Nobel Peace Prize."</blockquote>
<a name=times>
<FONT  SIZE=+2>3)</FONT> Sunday's CyberAlert also reported how <EM>The
Washington Times</EM> and <EM>Washington Post</EM> led page one with the
news that an aide to Craig Livingstone contradicted his
story on the FBI files. On Sunday, <EM>The New York Times</EM>
finally got around to reporting the revelation, but on the
bottom of page A30 under this vague headline: "New Testimony
Given on Republicans' Files."<p>
But at least <EM>The New York Times</EM> reported the news. I'm
still waiting to see the first broadcast network story.

<LI>In front of cameras in the Senate press conference facility on
Friday, Senator <a href="#orrin">Orrin Hatch </a> released the deposition of a former

venom, tagging a former Republican presidential candidate a

"hate." Special bonus: he trashes Kenneth Starr.

On Friday night's (October 4) CBS Evening News, reporter
Phil Jones explained what Dole has to do in the debate: "He's got
to explain how his campaign centerpiece, the 15 percent tax cut,
can be paid for without draconian cuts in social programs. He
wants to talk about the character issue, but he can't get
personal or look mean-spirited doing it."
<P>
    Avoiding a media tag of being mean-spirited will be pretty
tough. Just look at Thursday night's (October 3) The News with
Brian Williams on MSNBC.
 <P>   Williams announced: "We're going to take a look at the new
political ads that are out tonight. There are two of them. We're
going to begin with the latest ad from the Dole campaign which
takes the campaign into a bit of nasty territory. Here it is now
in its entirety."
<P>
<DD>    And here's the "nasty" ad:
<P>
<blockquote>Dole ad narrator: "How to speak liberal."<BR>
Clinton video: "I can tell you this. I will not raise taxes on
the middle class to pay for these programs."<BR>
Narrator: "That's liberal for I raised taxes right on the middle
class. How to speak more liberal."<BR>
Clinton: "People in this room still mad at me for that budget<BR>
because you think I raised your taxes too much."<BR>
Narrator: "That's liberal for I raised taxes even on Social
Security."<BR>
Clinton: "It might surprise you to know that I think I raised
them too much too."<BR>
Narrator: "That's liberal for I raised your taxes and got
caught."<BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
    Disjointed maybe, but nasty? Williams continued: "President 
Clinton is firing back with a new ad touting his achievements in 
office and once again tying Bob Dole to House Speaker Newt Gingrich."
<P>
    MSNBC showed the non-nasty ad which is all in color, except
for the video of Dole and Gingrich which is in black and white:
<P>
<blockquote>
Clinton ad narrator over video of scenes matching the text:
"Imagine. It's 11pm and you know where your kids are. At home.
President Clinton supports curfews so children are home and safe.
School uniforms to instill discipline. Ban cigarette ads aimed at
our children. Require teenage mothers to stay in school or lose
welfare.
<P> 
[black and white video of Dole next to Gingrich]: Dole and
Gingrich tried to slash school anti-drug programs. They'd take us
back.
<P>
[video in color of Clinton strolling under trees]: President
Clinton is looking forward. Helping parents to teach children
responsibility, protecting our values."
</blockquote>
<P>
<BR>
<a name="orrin">
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>2)</FONT>
The front page headline in the Saturday, October 5
Washington Times declared: "Livingstone Lied on 'Filegate,' Ex-Aide 
Implies." The Washington Post also made the news its lead
story: "White House Contradicted on FBI Files: Ex-Aide Tells
Panel Staff Knew of Checks on GOP Officials." The Los Angeles
Times ran a story inside, but Saturday's New York Times had not a
word.
<P>
    Having watched all three broadcast network evening shows
Friday night, this was news to me. ABC's World News Tonight, CBS
Evening News and the NBC Nightly News did not mention the
development.(CNN's The World Today co-anchor Linden Soles did do a
brief item on it with a soundbite from Hatch.) What did TV
viewers miss?
<P>    
Here's the opening of Post reporter George Lardner's story:
<blockquote>"A former executive assistant in the White House security office,
contradicting accounts by her old boss and co-workers, told
Senate investigators this week that 'everybody in the office
knew' in the fall of 1993 that they were obtaining FBI files on
'people who were no longer working there.'
"The aide, Mari Anderson, an ex-Clinton-Gore campaign worker,
said they even joked about some prominent Republicans still listed
as current White House pass holders."</blockquote>
 <P>
   Later in the story:
<P>
<blockquote>"Asked about a six-month gap in the security office log
maintained to show who checked out files, Anderson said she was
confident some pages were missing from the copy the White House
provided the committee. She said she distinctly remembered making
checkout notations in the loose-leaf log during that six month
period, from March 29, 1994, to September 21, 1994."
</blockquote>
<P>
    Nixon only "accidently erased" 18 minutes. 
<P>
   So, did the front page treatment in both of Washington's
newspapers prompt network interest? No. NBC's Today on Saturday
didn't mention the news, but did find time to report that the
maker of M&Ms is test marketing 18 new colors. Saturday night,
ABC and CBS evening shows were bumped by college football in DC,
but NBC Nightly News aired nothing.  
<P>
    Minutes later on CNN's Capital Gang National Review's Kate
O'Beirne made the revelations her Outrage of the Week, observing:
"It remains to be seen if this prompts the outrage from the
people in the press is so richly deserves."
<P>
    Not so far. Sunday morning Sam Donaldson at least did ask
This Week with David Brinkley guest Leon Panetta a question about
it.
<P>
<BR>
    UPDATE 1: Last week I reported that none of the broadcast
networks reported the September 25 revelation of the six month
gap in the log. MRC analyst Geoffrey Dickens has let me know that
CNN's The World Today (10pm ET) did air a whole piece that night
by Bob Franken.
<P>
    UPDATE 2: Last week I also reported that the networks failed
to note the FDIC report on how Hillary Clinton had deceived them.
Well, Friday night, a week and a half after the report made The
Washington Post's front page, it made NBC Nightly News, but only
through the hook of a chance to disparage Kenneth Starr for
speaking Friday at Regent University. 
 <P>
   NBC's Jim Miklaszewski reported: "Whitewater prosecutor
Kenneth Starr was invited to appear by outspoken Clinton critic
Pat Robertson and the audience was very conservative. The White
House claims that's proof Starr is out to get Clinton for
political reasons, but Starr says he'll stay the course."
<P>
    Miklaszewski went on to summarize the status of Starr's
inquiry into the First Lady. Miklaszewski described the
FDIC report and aired the White House rebuttal.
<P>
<BR>
<a name="al">
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>3)</FONT>
 On Saturday's Capital Gang (October 5) on CNN, Al Hunt,
Wall Street Journal Executive Washington Editor, was full of
hate. 
<P>
<blockquote>    -- "I think North Carolina is a test in the great divide in
the Republican conservative movement. There's the politics of
hope personified by Jack Kemp and there's the politics of hate
personified by Jesse Helms."<P>
    -- On Louisiana where Democrat Landrieu faces Republican
Jenkins: "In Louisiana, I think, Mary Landrieu is a bad
candidate, but she's going to win for three reasons. Woody
Jenkins is an extremist, Bill Clinton's going to carry Louisiana
and Newt Gingrich has scared those African-Americans. There'll be
a big black turnout."<P>
    -- His Outrage of the Week: "Kenneth Starr, the supposedly
non-partisan independent counsel investigating the Clintons, was
the featured speaker yesterday at a luncheon sponsored by right
wing hatemonger Pat Robertson, *whose Christian Broadcasting
Network and Regent Law School*. By pandering to Clinton-haters,
Mr. Starr appears to be abandoning all pretenses of impartiality.
He went into this job with a reputation as a fair-minded
conservative. He now looks more like a political hit man
desperately eager for a future Supreme Court appointment." 
    [* There is a word missing, but that's what he said.]

ABC <I>World News Tonight</I> anchor Forest Sawyer announced<BR>
Thursday night (October 3): 
<P>    "For days President Clinton has been dominating the news with
his efforts to ease the crisis between Israel and the
Palestinians. Today, Bob Dole decided to step onto center stage
with a harshly worded attack not only on the administration's
work in the Middle East, but its entire foreign policy. Senator
Dole called the past three years rudderless and illusionary. He
claimed the President has squandered American power. The
administration has so far answered softly, but says there is more
to come."
<P>
    Reporter John Cochran went on the tag the speech as
"scathing." He reported: "In a scathing critique of Clinton
foreign policy, Dole rolled off a long list of what he called
failures, going back to the 1993 effort to restore order in
Somalia."
<P>
    What was the administration's response that earned Sawyer's
"soft" description? CBS and NBC viewers heard Press Secretary
Mike McCurry's retort. He played off Spiro Agnew's "nattering
nabobs of negativism" line (not generally considered "soft") and
asserted that Dole foreign policy advisers are "nattering
naysayers of gloom." ABC didn't show viewers McCurry's soundbite.
<P>
    On NBC Nightly News, David Bloom also used the term "harsh"
to describe Dole's speech: "It was Dole's harshest critique yet
of what he called Clinton's failed foreign policy." But a bit
later in his story Bloom put the tone in a better light, noting
that "After reviewing his speech over breakfast with retired
General Colin Powell, Dole chose his words carefully. His tone
was measured. He was playing politics, but he wanted to appear
presidential."

CBS reporter Rita Braver profiled Al Gore Thursday
night. Her October 3 Evening News piece included this rather
bizarre sequence: 
<blockquote>Braver: "He's in on every key White House meeting and
decision. Just last month in his role as environmental guru, Gore
convinced the President to create a controversial national
monument in Utah. Of late, Republican have attacked him for making
a convention speech about his sister's death from lung cancer
caused by smoking."<BR>
Gore at Democratic convention: "It hurt very badly to watch her
savaged by that terrible disease."<BR>
Braver: "While for several years after her death he let tobacco
be grown on land he owned. Gore dismisses that attack as
politics, an attempt to sully a man so close to the President he
feels free to interrupt him."<BR>
Gore, going to microphone in front of Clinton: "Could I add a
word since..."<BR>
Braver: "But above all Gore sees his job as making the President
look good. And he's been amply rewarded. It's no secret that if
Bill Clinton is re-elected he wants Al Gore to succeed him."
</blockquote>
<P>
    So, CBS acknowledges the whole premise of Gore's emotional
convention speech was a fraud, but it's wrong to even raise the
subject because he's so powerful he can cut in front of the
President at a podium.

"Reporters want nothing more than, this year and four years ago,
to have a horse race. That's what we're in love with, is the
fight, the close call....So it's in our best interest to make it
look close, to make Bob Dole look good."

<B>Reality Check: </B>
<P>
"The former Senator argued that voters have a choice between two
different visions of government... The ex-deficit hawk returned
to the centerpiece of his campaign, a 15 percent tax cut.
Campaign aides claim they have private polls showing President
Clinton vulnerable on the tax issue. That's the reason for this
attack. But between now and election day the Republican nominee
has to do more than criticize. He's got to sell the Dole plan."
<DD>-- Reporter Phil Jones, September 24 CBS <I>Evening News</I>.
<P>
<BR>
NBC reporter David Bloom: "So now Dole, who's complained about
Clinton's campaign of fear, is taking a similar tack."
Bob Dole: "Secrets, secrets. Remember the FBI files that went to
the White House."<BR>
Bloom: "With the election just six weeks away, calling Bill
Clinton a liberal might soon look tame."<DD> -- September 24 NBC
<I>Nightly News</I>.
<P>
<BR>
"The same cynicism that may deflect attacks on Clinton seems to
work directly against Bob Dole, with many voters here calling his
15 percent tax cut idea a political gimmick....Many of the voters
we spoke with blamed Gingrich for last year's government
shutdown, for a mean-spirited attitude generally, and for
attempts to trim Medicare specifically." <DD>-- ABC's Dean Reynolds

"Why do you suppose it is that one year after his acquittal, most
white Americans at least, cannot accept the idea that he's out

<DD>-- Bryant Gumbel to O.J. Simpson lawyer Johnnie Cochran in part one of
three day interview series, September 30 <I>Today</I>.
<P>
<BR>
Gumbel: "Do you think if those two victims had been, say,
Marguerite, his first wife, and Al Cowlings, his best friend,
that there would have been the same amount [of media attention]?"
Johnnie Cochran: "Absolutely not. And I think any person who
wants to be honest about it would say the same thing."
Gumbel: "Why? Because America doesn't care about black victims?"
<P>
"Most white Americans still charge that O.J.'s jurors didn't do
their job. You talk about a rush to judgment. They would claim
the same. They would claim the verdict was race-based. Do you
think their judgment of those jurors is race-based?"

doesn't he just accept it and be himself? Try to hold the
Republican Congress and get rid of this book, and get rid of
these crazy 15 percent tax cuts and speak from the heart?" <DD> -- NBC
Washington Bureau Chief Tim Russert to Dole campaign manager
Scott Reed on CNBC's <I>Tim Russert</I>, September 22.
<P>
"Americans are forever grumbling about high taxes and big
government. You'd think promising a tax cut would be like giving
away free candy. What's not to like? Everybody knows what happens
when you eat too much candy. You get cavities. You get sick. You
get fat. A big tax cut may feel good but it can cause
problems...`Candy?' Dole says. `No thank you,' the voters reply.
`We're feeling much better now and we don't want to get sick
again.' Dr. Dole and Dr. Kemp are supply-side specialists. They
have a revolutionary theory that says `Candy is good for you!
More tax cuts, more growth. More growth, more income.' Now what a
terrific theory! And so what if Democratic doctors say they are a
couple of quacks. Gene [Randall], have some candy!"

"I think, generally speaking, most people would agree that the

Elizabeth Dole? It hasn't happened, and yet you see the
Republicans attacking Hillary Rodham Clinton, who I agree has
made mistakes, but they [Republicans] have no boundaries, and I
think that yes, both parties are guilty of using smear tactics --
it goes back to as I said the origin of American politics -- but
I think the Republicans are quite frankly, better at it than the
Democrats, and I think most people see that and believe
that....Why don't you recognize some of the hypocrisy on the part
of the Republicans?....Well, for starters, a rape victim up on

<LI><a href="#gumbel">Bryant Gumbel</a> wonders if OJ Simpson "will ever get a fair shake in this country?" It's one of several liberal questions on race he poses to Johnnie Cochran.
<LI><a href="#moderate">The newly moderate</a> President Clinton attends a fundraiser packed with aging 1960s lefties and Hollywood celebrities with animus toward Republicans. 
<LI><a href="#faithful">Incredibly, a major newspaper</a> says it was an error to report that Bill Clinton and Dick Morris have been unfaithful to their wives.
</OL>
<P>
<a name="gumbel">
<B>1) Wednesday's Today (October 2)</B> carried the third part of
Bryant Gumbel's interview with Johnnie Cochran. And as he did on
Monday, Gumbel again used the segment as an opportunity to
promote his liberal views on race.
<P>
<DD>Discussing how much media attention the first OJ trial
attracted, Bryant Gumbel asked: "Do you think if those two
victims had been, say, Marguerite, his first wife, and Al
Cowlings, his best friend, that there would have been the same
amount?"
<P>
<DD>Johnnie Cochran responded: "Absolutely not. And I think any
person who wants to be honest about it would say the same thing."<BR>
<DD>To which Gumbel shot back: "Why? Because America doesn't care
about black victims?"
<P>
<DD>After Cochran's reply, Gumbel inquired: "Most white Americans
still charge that OJ's jurors didn't do their job. You talk about
a rush to judgment. They would claim the same. They would claim
the verdict was race based. Do you think their judgment of those
jurors is race based?"
<P>
<DD>Then, after asking if the complicated case merited more
consideration that jury gave it in a few hour of deliberation, 
Gumbel wondered: "Do you think OJ will ever get a fair shake in
this country. Will people ever let him live out his life and
accept the fact that he was acquitted?"
<P>
<DD>Fair shake? He's a millionaire football player who
successfully led a second career as a sports commentator, actor
and commercial spokesman. He then murders two people but is found
not guilty. How unfair.
<P>
<a name="moderate">
<B>2) At Boston's Fleet Center Saturday night</B> the Democrats
and Senator John Kerry held a $2 million fundraiser starring
several celebrities.  
<P>
<DD>During the Democratic convention, NBC's Tom Brokaw insisted
that since 1992 Clinton and Gore "have slid across the political
spectrum to really right of center." Keeping that assurance in
mind, here's a bit of Boston Globe reporter Michael Grunwald's
September 29 story on the event: "Peter, Paul and Mary played
'Blowin in the Wind,' even though President Clinton has been
accused of doing just that. In fact, the legendary folk trio even
played 'Puff the Magic Dragon' -- and the President clapped along,
war on drugs notwithstanding....It was a long, strange trip at
the Fleet Center last night, as a parade of lefty rockers and
folkies brought back a slice of 1960s culture for a 1990s audience." 
<P>
<DD>These 1960s activists were in attendance to praise the
President. The Washington Post reported on September 30: "Mary
Travers said peace, justice and equality are still what the fight
is all about, while [Don] Henley praised the President for
protecting the environment and exhorted the audience to elect a
Democratic Congress 'so that there will be trees to hug,'"
<P>
<DD>Current stars also attended as the Boston Herald's Ed Hayward
reported that comedienne/actress Whoopi Goldberg announced: "I'm
glad to see some good-looking people in office. The other party
seems to have taken some ugly pills."
<P>
<DD>Isn't that the kind of language the media deem "nasty" when
uttered by a conservative?
<P>
<a name="faithful">
<B>3) The Internet Guild's Steve Allen caught this gem</B> while
doing a Nexis search. Under the "corrections and clarifications"
heading the September 5 Chicago Tribune corrected syndicated
columnist Linda Bowles: 
<P>
<DD>"In her Wednesday Commentary page column, Linda Bowles stated
that President Clinton and his former campaign adviser Dick
Morris both were 'guilty of callous unfaithfulness to their wives
and children.' Neither man has admitted to being or been proven to
have been unfaithful. The Tribune regrets the error." 
<P>
<DD>So, this is an "error" but reporting "slashes" in Medicare or
school lunches is just solid reporting.

<a name="20/20">
<B>1) On Friday night (September 20) ABC's 20/20</B><BR> ran Barbara
Walters' interview with the Clintons. Introducing the second segment,
co-host Hugh Downs announced: 
<P>
<DD>    "She is, perhaps, the most criticized, the most scrutinized,
First Lady in history. Everyone has an opinion about Hillary Clinton,
and Mrs. Clinton has heard them all. How has her marriage changed in
these four years? What are her concerns now, both personal and political?
Barbara continues now with the President and the First Lady, the world's
most powerful couple."
<P>
<DD>    During that segment, Bill Clinton said he might have Hillary
work on welfare reform during his second term, a suggestion that he
may scale back welfare reform to please liberals. But instead of pursuing 
the possibility that his signature was nothing more than election-year
positioning, in the next segment Walters asked him:
<P>
<DD>"Even your own aides, many of them, and advisers feel that the bill 
is too extreme. Two of your advisers recently quit. Under the new bill a
60 year old federal guarantee of aid to needy families will end. It's

"Dole decided only this morning to speak to the Christian

voters....Clinton's campaign spokesman said in a statement:
`Watching Bob Dole arm in arm with Pat Robertson speaks volumes
to the extreme agenda being pursued by the Dole-Kemp-Gingrich
team.' Bob Dole tried, perhaps even succeeded today, in
reinvigorating his Republican base. But a top Clinton campaign

That comes as no surprise to Bob Dole. Dole had been invited to
speak at the convention yesterday, but declined. He claimed he
was already committed to campaigning and the All-Star baseball
game. To those at this convention that was quite a stretch and
an insult to African-American voters....By not showing up here,
Bob Dole may reinforce those racial divides along party lines

<B>Fallows' Hillary Fan Club Application</B><BR>
"Is Hillary Clinton's predicament worse because she is a woman?
Probably so. From Primary Colors to Rush Limbaugh to Saturday
Night Live, the hostile stereotype of Hillary is the domineering
ice-woman, the one person who scares the Most Powerful Man in
the World. Bill Clinton has suffered when judged on the age-old
standard of masculinity: military service. But female observers,
from Camille Paglia to Maureen Dowd, have judged Hillary with a
catty ferocity they would not apply to men. A man with a prim
exterior can get into trouble, too, as Jimmy Carter could
testify, but he mainly risks being seen as a weakling. Such a
woman is an emasculating schemer." <BR>

<B>Intensely Competitive Puff Pieces About Gore</B><BR>
"George Bush fumed about jokes that he had put his manhood in a
blind trust to serve as Ronald Reagan's Vice President. The
young Dan Quayle never convinced the country he had the gravitas
to be Veep, let alone top man. But the cerebral, private,
intensely competitive Al Gore has managed the contortionist's
feat of projecting an almost perfect loyalty to his boss's
re-election without diminishing himself...Gore and Clinton, both
brainy, moderate Southerners with an abiding interest in the
plumbing of government, speak an easy shorthand and razz each
other like competitive brothers." <BR>
<DD><I>-- Time Washington reporter J.F.O. McAllister, September 2.</I>
<P>
"Though Al Gore relishes politics almost as much as his boss
does, tonight he is next door in the Old Executive Office
Building, doing what he really loves: thinking about complexity
theory, open systems, Goethe and the absence of scientific
metaphors in modern society. He's writing a speech, and the
elegant Ceremonial Office is strewn with pizza cartons and Diet
Coke cans...Clinton may lead the country into the millennium,
but it is Gore who truly embodies the new century's
possibilities and anxieties."<BR>

the vehicle of white supremacy in the South, beginning with the
Goldwater campaign and reaching its apex in Richard M. Nixon's
`Southern Strategy' in 1968 and 1972. Republicans appealed to
Nixon Democrats (later Reagan Democrats) in the northern
suburbs, many of them ethnic voters who had left the cities to
escape from blacks, with promises to crack down on welfare
cheats and to impose law and order, and they fought against
affirmative action." <BR>

<B>Clinton Makes Life Great, Dole Makes It Worse</B><BR>
"For most people in this country, life is awfully good. So
Clinton doesn't need to raise any issues. He just needs to point
to his record and promise more of the same. The people who don't
have a great life right now -- the 39 million people below the
poverty level, the 40 million people with no health insurance,
the 6.2 million people earning at or below the minimum wage --
are the people who really do have the issues. But Dole isn't
about to reach out to them, and they aren't about to vote for
Dole or the Republicans. That would make their plight worse, if

ambitious politician knows that the sure way to command press
attention is with sensationalism and extremist polemics. Newt
Gingrich built his power with media fireworks." <BR>

<LI><a href="#headline">A USA Today headline</a> blasts the Republican Congress for being "mean."
<LI><a href="#acceptance">Acceptance of the charge</a> that the media are biased in favor of Clinton has pervaded mass culture -- it was part of the opening skit on the season premiere of Saturday Night Live.

<a name="networks">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>1) Last week</FONT> I reported that the network evening shows had
failed to mention a FDIC report which concluded that Hillary
Clinton had drafted a real estate document meant to "deceive"
federal regulators. The FDIC report was released last Monday,
September 23. Through Monday night September 30 it had yet to
generate a mention on any of the broadcast networks.
<P>
<I>What else went unreported on network evening shows last week:</I>
-- On Tuesday, September 24 a House committee held hearing on
how the Clinton Administration let criminals become citizens. The
Washington Times story the next day began: "Immigration workers
yesterday told a House Government Reform and Oversight
subcommittee of  rampant' abuses in the Citizenship USA program
that apparently let thousands of immigrants with criminal records
become citizens."
<I>Network evening show coverage: Still waiting.</I>
<P>
-- On Wednesday, September 25. Senator Orrin Hatch revealed a
six month gap in the log listing who at the White House accessed
the FBI background files. The Washington Times bannered the news
across page one the next day.
<I>Network evening show coverage: Still waiting.</I>
<P>
-- also on Wednesday, The Washington Times reported that U.S.
Rep. John Mica had sent a letter to Clinton's drug czar demanding
release of a four month old Institute for Defense Analysis report
that concluded Bush's interdiction policy was far more effective
than Clinton's drug treatment emphasis. Just 9 percent of
Clinton's drug budget goes to interdiction.
<I>Network evening show coverage: Still waiting, but drug czar Barry McCaffrey is scheduled to respond at an October 1 House hearing.</I>
<P>
-- On Thursday, September 26, 170 members of Congress send a
letter to Clinton asking that he promise not to pardon any
Whitewater figures. In an interview last Monday on the PBS
NewsHour Clinton had said he thought Kenneth Starr was out to get
him and the President defended Susan McDougal's decision to
refuse to testify. The Sunday Washington Times had a story which
began: "House Democrats were prepared to shut down the government
if Republican demanded a vote on a resolution calling for
President Clinton not to pardon key Whitewater figures, Rep.
Spencer Bachus said yesterday."
<I>Network evening show coverage: One question from anchor John Roberts to analyst Laura Ingraham on the Sept. 29 CBS Evening News.</I>
<P>
What did they cover? Between last Thursday and Sunday each of
the network evening shows aired two stories on Newt Gingrich's
dealings with the House ethics committee. And on Sunday's Today,
co-host Jodie Applegate couldn't quite get her history correct,
asking Gingrich Press Secretary Tony Blankley:
    "Mr. Blankley, it was seven years ago that Newt Gingrich
called on Jim Wright, who was then the Speaker of the House, to
step aside because an investigation had begun into his affairs."
<P>
<I>Of course the investigation had more than "begun."</I>
<P>
<a name="headline">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>2) The House</FONT> wrapped up its work over the weekend. Monday's
USA Today headline over a page A13 story reviewing the session
under GOP control read: "A Lean, Some Say Mean, GOP Machine."
<P>
<a name="acceptance">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>3) Another sign</FONT> of positive progress: On the September 28
Saturday Night Live guest host Tom Hanks played Peter Jennings in
skit in which Jennings interviews Clinton, Dole and Perot. 
<BR><DD>Here's Tom Hanks as Peter Jennings: "Mr. President, we here
at ABC News are not in the business of making endorsements, but
everyone here is voting for Bill Clinton and I personally cannot
imagine how any decent person would not, in fact, do the same. In
light of this, which of your many achievements do you feel
important to emphasize as we head toward the election?"
<P>
<I>It's hard to tell parody from reality.</I>
<P>
<a name="clinton">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>4) Friday's Washington Post</FONT> "In the Loop" column relayed:
"Scuttlebutt at the Voice of America has it that former U.S. News
& World Report political reporter Steven Roberts is being wooed
to replace outgoing VOA director Geoffrey Cowan." New U.S. News
Editor James Fallows asked Roberts to step down a few weeks ago,
but the Post reported that "The VOA was thinking about Roberts
before new U.S. News boss James Fallows began the purge."
<P>
<a name="yes">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>5) On Monday's (Sept. 30) Today,</FONT> Bryant Gumbel began day
one of a three day series with Johnnie Cochran. While Gumbel did
ask about OJ's alibi and how even if the Los Angeles police
botched the investigation and employ racist, that it's hard to
believe a conspiracy, he also posed these two questions:
    "Comments that he has made to others would seem to indicate a
certain degree of, and not unjustifiably, a certain degree of
anger, bitterness. Has he expressed that to you?"
    "Why do you suppose it is that one year after his acquittal,
most white Americans at least, cannot accept the idea that he's
out walking around free, refuse to let him live his life?"
<P>
<I>Hmmm? Could it be that not everyone is happy that he got away with murder?</I>

<OL>
<LI><a href="#abc">ABC's World News Tonight</a>, which didn't report poverty and
income statistics when they were bad, highlighted them Thursday
night when they helped Clinton. And their one expert credited
the President.
<LI><a href="#what">What's wrong with liberalism,</a> CNN's Bernard Shaw asks plaintively.   
</OL>
<a name="abc">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>1) Bad news is news, not good news. Right?</FONT> Not at ABC when
the good news benefits Clinton.
<P>
    On October 6, 1994 the Census Bureau reported poverty had
risen to a three-decade high. ABC's World News Tonight: No story.
On October 5, 1995 the bureau reported a slight drop in poverty,
but the gap between richest and poorest grew. ABC's World News
Tonight: No story.
<P>
    On September 26, 1996 the Census bureau reports median income
up and poverty down. ABC's World News Tonight: Big story
crediting Bill Clinton.
<P>
    Peter Jennings opened the show Thursday night: "On World News
Tonight this Thursday, a bloody day between Israelis and
Palestinians. The Census Bureau says that Americans are earning
more for the first time in six years. Family income is up."
<P>
    Barry Serafin reported in his story that median household
income was up 2.7 percent, but still lower than 1989. Serafin's
story continued:
<BR><DD>"The number of Americans living in poverty fell. There were 36.4
million people below the poverty level, 1.6 million fewer than
the year before. The poverty rate for African-Americans dropped
to its lowest level since 1959, 29.3 percent. What does it add up
to?"
<BR><DD>Professor Frank Levy, MIT: "Things are slowly getting better and
the people feel OK about it. It's not nirvana, but it's certainly
not doom and gloom either."
<BR><DD>Serafin: "And there was certainly no gloom and doom at the White
House where the President pounced on the new figures."
Clinton: "The news is remarkably good, and I'd like to share it
with you."
<BR><DD>Serafin: "Citing the income gains the President declared that the
country is on the right track. He heralded progress on narrowing
the gap between the richest and poorest Americans"
<BR><DD>Clinton: "We have had the largest decline in the inequality of
incomes in America in 27 years."
<BR><DD>Serafin: "Census Bureau officials, however, said that decline was
so small it was statistically insignificant. Still, there was
praise for today's generally upbeat report."
<BR><DD>Levy: "Well I think the credit is shared between the President
and Alan Greenspan at the Federal Reserve."
<BR><DD>Serafin: "All in all the new numbers added to a very good day for
Bill Clinton."
<P>
<DD>The New York Times reported June 30 that "the share of
national income earned by the top 5 percent of households grew at
a faster rate than during the eight years of the Reagan
administration, which was often characterized as favoring the
rich." ABC's World News Tonight that night: No story.
<P>
<DD>Immediately following Serafain, Jim Wooten reported on Bob
Dole in Florida. Wooten noted that Dole correctly pointed out
that poverty rose in Florida, then reported: "Still, the Senator
had much less to say about the numbers than about a President he
says is lying to older Americans, telling them Republicans will
cut Medicare, trying to frighten them into voting Democratic."
<BR><DD>Following a Dole soundbite, Wooten continued: "Then Senator
Dole tried to raise a bit of fear himself about Mr. Clinton's
plans for a second term."
<BR><DD>Dole: "He'll raise taxes again on the America people if he's re-elected."
Wooten: "The Senator insists that his principle campaign themes -- his 
bad news message about a limping economy, stagnate wages, high taxes 
and heavy deficits -- will eventually change the shape of this election. 
So far they haven't, but he keeps trying."
<P>
<DD>They might have a better chance if ABC weren't endorsing Clinton's 
claims while countering Dole's by saying he's also employing fear. 
<P>
<a name="what">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>2) On the September 25 Inside Politics</FONT> CNN's Bernie Shaw
took up the Dole charge that Clinton is really a liberal. To put
Shaw's question in context, here's how the exchange went with
Republican strategist Charlie Black and Democratic strategist
Frank Greer:
<BR><DD>Charlie Black: "People don't mind name calling if you call them
conservatives, which is what Bob Dole is. Teenage drug use has
doubled because Bill Clinton reduced the size of the White House
drug office 83 percent. How can you say he's had a good record on
drugs? Bernie, here's the problem. Bill Clinton wants the federal
government to run your life. He wants to take more and more of
your hard-earned money and then he wants to reward you a tax
credit if you behave the way he wants you to behave."
<BR><DD>Frank Greer: "It's the same worn-out rhetoric that they tried to
use in Congress and it didn't work."
<BR><DD>Bernard Shaw: "I understand the desire to talk about issues. I
understand that. A very innocent question. What's wrong with
being a liberal?"

<H3> 1)</H3> On Tuesday night's (September 17) World News Tonight, ABC's
Jim Wooten reported from Arizona on Bob Dole's campaign. Wooten 
asserted:<P>

<DD>"It's one measure of Senator Dole's problems that he even feels it 
<DD>necessary to campaign here in Arizona, Barry Goldwater's ultra-
<DD>conservative backyard. But the race is close here, quite close."
<P>
    Not "usually safe for Republicans," but "ultra-conservative." How

<H3>2)</H3> The September 23 Weekly Standard includes a profile of chief
White House speechwriter Donald Baer who had been Assistant Managing
Editor of U.S. News & World Report when he jumped to the Clinton team
in 1994. Writer Christopher Caldwell explained how Baer got his job:
<DD>    "Clinton liked the articles Baer contributed to U.S. News during
the 1992 campaign. While other journalists -- David Shribman of The
Wall Street Journal, Joe Klein of New York, Ron Brownstein of the Los
Angeles Times -- ignored the more sensational aspects of the campaign
for enthusiastic grapplings with 'Clintonism,' Baer wrote with extreme
empathy about Clinton's background.
 <DD>   "'I think it's a southern thing' says one of Baer's journalistic
colleagues, who also knows Clinton. 'Being of the South and still being
rooted there, yet being driven and ambitious enough to prove oneself
in the larger world -- the two of them have a lot in common.' While
Baer has always been a loyal Democrat, he's not necessarily a liberal.
Like Clinton, he has an idiosyncratic, instinctive, generally 
progressive politics that winds up at beyond-left-and-rightism. This 
enthusiasm can appear like ideological non-commitment or caginess. 
One New Democrat who met Baer at a dinner last year described him as 
'bland beyond description, a fount of cliches. 'Clinton was the moral 
leader of the Universe,' and all that.'"

<BR>
<BR>
<BR><a name="study"> </a>
<H3>    3) </H3>Last week the MRC released its study of prime time network
coverage of the party conventions. We found four times more extremist
labels were applied to Republicans as Democrats, but Democrats were
tagged liberal twice as often as Republicans were called conservative.
In addition, virtually all of the questions to both parties came from 
the left as the networks portrayed both the Republicans and Democrats
as too conservative. 

<DD>    Last week the Center for Media and Public Affairs also released
its study. CMPA examined not prime time but the ABC, CBS and NBC
evening newscasts during the two convention weeks. Some of their
findings:
<UL>
<LI> "Journalists continued to crowd out the politicians, taking
up 12 times as much airtime as the newsmakers. Reporters' comments
took up 75% of the speaking time in convention stories, compared
to only 6% for the four nominees. Other party officials and delegates
accounted for 10% of the airtime."
<LI>  Both parties' policies got even worse press than their 
candidates -- three to 1 negative overall. Five out of six sources 
(83%) criticized GOP policies, and two out of three (67%) rejected 
the Democrats' stands."
</UL>
<P>
    The Washington Post's John Carmody summarized the finding: 
"Comments on the two issues most talked about -- abortion during
the GOP meeting, welfare during the Democrats' -- suggested a 
left-liberal bent."

<LI>On Tuesday's Today show <a href="#gumbel"> Bryant Gumbel </a> interviewed Susan McDougal
from  jail in Arkansas. But instead of pressing her on why she
won't tell what she knows (for which she's been granted
immunity), Gumbel sympathized with her plight and portrayed her
as a victim of Republican politics. He asked: "Have you any doubt
that Kenneth Starr and his deputies are pursuing an agenda that
is purely political?"
<P>
<LI> CNBC cancels the <a href="#cal"> Cal Thomas </a> show, a decision Thomas says will
only fuel conservative feelings that the media are liberal.

1. Susan McDougal has already been found guilty of fraud
and been jailed for contempt of court for over a week for
refusing to answer questions about Bill Clinton's knowledge of
the fraudulent SBA loan deal. From the September 17 Today show,
here are some of Gumbel's questions to her, transcribed by MRC
intern Matt Turosz:
<P>
    Gumbel: Mrs. McDougal, let me start with you if I might. How
bad has confinement been there in Conway?"
<P>
    Gumbel: "How are you being treated by the authorities and the
other inmates?"
<P>
    Gumbel: "There are those who are obviously hoping that in
prison will prompt a change of heart on you part. Are you having
any second thoughts about refusing to answer questions?"
<P>
    Gumbel then posed his one and only tough question: "According
to reports, you were charged with contempt after being asked to
testify, about whether Bill Clinton knew about an illegal loan or
the purchase of a piece of property with some loan proceeds. Why
have you refused to answer that question?"
<P>
    McDougal responded by claiming Ken Starr had lied to her
before and failed to come through on a deal: "He used witnesses
against me with perjured testimony. Would you buy a used car from
this man. I certainly wouldn't go into a hearing without my
lawyer, into a grand jury room, and answer questions he asked me.
He has lied repeatedly. I won't deal with him."
<P>
    Instead of challenging her, Gumbel summarized her view: "So
basically you don't trust his promises of immunity from
prosecution in exchange for answers to his questions?"
<P>
    McDougal responded: "...He has lied about me. He has lied
during the trial. He has lied after the trial. And he has said
many times give us a proffer, something against the Clintons,
something that we can use, and we'll make all your problems go
away. Well, I'm sorry, that's just not how America works, and
that not how I want to deal with him."
<P>    
Gumbel next queried "Is there any amount of time in jail that
might make your either (A) change your mind or (B) have second
thoughts about trusting Mr. Starr and his deputies?"
<P>
    McDougal answered: "I told you earlier, I become stronger
everyday in my conviction everyday that I sit here."
<P>
    Gumbel then asserted: "Have you any doubt that Kenneth Starr
and his deputies are pursuing an agenda that is purely
political?"
<P>
    McDougal: "I don't believe anyone in America doubts it....I
want to know were I can go to complain about these people's evil
agenda to overrun me to get to the President."
<P>
    Gumbel took the same approach in talking to her lawyer:
"Bobby McDaniel, you said that your client is being used as
political pawn. Have you any legal recourse but to sit there and
watch this unfold?"
<P>
    A couple of questions later Gumbel returned to McDougal and
again bought her premise: "Given that you think this is all just
a Republican witch hunt, do you expect the pressure to ease
somewhat after the election?"
<P>

2. On Monday CNBC announced the cancellation of the weekend
interview shows hosted by Cal Thomas, Al Roker and Gerry Spence.
Thomas's last show (6:30pm and 1am ET Sat. and Sun.) will air in
early October. The Washington Post's John Carmody on Tuesday
quoted Thomas suggesting that the decision will "further the
already deep suspicion among conservatives that the news media is
overwhelmingly liberal."
<P>
    I'll let you know when Thomas finds another outlet and,
hopefully, a more prominent time slot.

<B>Dear MRC Member</B>,
<BR>
<P>
What happened to the conservative revolution we were all so excited about a year and a half ago? On Election Day 1994 the GOP captured both the House and the Senate, Clinton's socialized health care plan had been demolished, his agenda was in ruins. Most conservatives were celebrating the death of liberalism. 
<P><blockquote><I>I wasn't. I publicly warned that the conservative movement had no idea what was about to hit it.</I></blockquote>
<P>And did it ever. The left-wing press launched the most vicious, dishonest character 
assassination campaign I've ever seen. Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, and others were vilified daily. The media flat out lied, thousands of times in 
fact, about the Contract with America, saying the "cuts" were going to put women and children, the poor and the elderly, on the streets -- hungry and naked. Clean air, clean water, our national parks -- everything was endangered. 
All because of those "tax cuts for the rich."
<P>You know I'm not exaggerating any of this.The left-wing press stopped at nothing in its attacks. Just look at how they accused the conservative talk radio community of responsibility for the greatest act of terrorism in U.S. history -- the Oklahoma City bombing. It defies belief.
<P>And look at the damage the liberal media caused. Today the Contract with America is 
in shambles. Newt Gingrich has the worst approval rating of any politician in America. And 
Bill Clinton -- considered politically dead one year ago -- is enjoying his highest ratings ever, and leading Bob Dole by 20 points according to some surveys.
<P><I><blockquote>The national press has turned much of America against our ideas by distorting 
everything we stand for. Theirs is an awesome power -- and they are using it.</blockquote></I>
<P>At a national press conference, which took place on June 5, I announced that the 
Media Research Center at <a href="http://www.mediaresearch.org">http://www.mediaresearch.org</a> 
has launched the biggest political counterattack in history to stop these `60s-era elitists once and for all. 
<P>The MRC has been quietly working on our<B> "Tell the Truth!" </B>campaign for months, 
test-marketing it to conservative activists and voters each week. In the past few weeks my staff and I have been interviewed for ABC's <I>Nightline</I>, CNN's <I>Crossfire</I>, CBN's<I> 700 Club</I>, C-SPAN, CNBC, and many other national media outlets. 
<P>A powerful forum for the MRC is talk radio. In the past month, we've conducted over 50 radio interviews which have aired on hundreds of stations, and reached millions of voters. MRC spokesmen have appeared on nationally syndicated shows like the 
<I>G. Gordon Liddy Show</I>, the  <I>Ollie North Show</I>, and the <I>Michael Reagan Show.</I> And, when Rush Limbaugh invited me to host his radio show recently, I used it to show millions of Americans just how distorted the left-wing press has become.
<P>And this is just the tip of the iceberg. We are combining our sophisticated media 
research operation with advanced technology to produce the most comprehensive and 
creative national campaign ever waged to confront, expose, and neutralize the liberal media.
<blockquote><I><P>The MRC <B>"Tell the Truth!"</B> campaign is hitting the liberal press in a way it's never been hit before. We have one message for the left-wing "news" media: Your days of 
unchecked bias are over. </I></blockquote>
<P>I am confident that this critically important campaign will end the media's non-stop 
attacks on conservatives, and put an end to their incessant support for Clinton and his ilk. Because of the urgency and importance of this campaign, your generous gift to the MRC is more vital than ever.<U> Thank you for helping us.</U>

<p>
<H3>    Only one item today:</H3>
<P>       
<BR>
    Bill Clinton snubbed the Christian Coaltion conference over the weekend, 
but the media reacted a bit differently than when Bob Dole decided to not 
address the NAACP. 
<P> 
    Friday night none of the network evening news shows mentioned Clinton's
decision not to appear, though all did pieces on the conference. The issue
came up only on CNN's Inside Politics. In July, all the networks aired stories
about Dole not going to the NAACP convention. (Dole made a surprise appearance 
at the Christian Coalition meeting on Saturday and offered an introduction to
Jack Kemp who had been scheduled.) 
<P>
    Neither ABC or CBS had an evening newscast Saturday night on 
Washington stations because of college football, but NBC did not
get bumped for sports, so let's compare NBC's coverage.
<P>
On the July 10 NBC Nightly News, Jim Miklaszewski reported from the
NAACP gathering:
<P>    
<DD>"No doubt this was a Clinton crowd. That comes as no surprise to Bob 
Dole. Dole had been invited to speak at the convention yesterday, but declined.
He claimed he was already committed to campaigning and the All-Star baseball 
game. To those at this convention that was quite a stretch and an insult to
African-American voters."
<P>    
After explaining how the crowd was very anti-Republican, Miklaszewski
concluded his story: "By not showing up here, Bob Dole may reinforce those
racial divides along party lines and fuel the anxiety among some Republicans 
that in this presidential campaign, Bob Dole may not be up to the challenge."
<P>
On Saturday night's (September 14) NBC Nightly News, David Bloom 
reported:
<P>
<DD>    "Dole decided only this morning to speak to the Christian Coalition 
despite worries inside his campaign that a bow to the religious right might
send the wrong message to moderate, swing voters."
<P>
    Bloom concluded his story:
<P>
<DD>    "Clinton's campaign spokeman said in a statement 'watching Bob Dole arm 
in arm with Pat Robertson speaks volumes to the extreme agenda being pursued 
by the Dole-Kemp-Gingrich team.' Bob Dole tried, perhaps even succeeded today, 
in re-invigorating his Republican base. But a top Clinton campaign official 
was all smiles, saying, 'if you see Dole, tell him thanks for me.'"
<P>
    Anchor Brian Williams then announced: "The Christian Coaltion claims 
almost two million active members and is a potent political force in 31 states, 
but its voice is no longer the lone voice for conservative Christians. NBC's 
Bob Abernethy has our report."
<P>    Abernethy then began his bizarre story on "conservative" Christians:
<P>
<DD>"The Christian Coalition's organization, money and grassroots activism have 
made it one of the most important voices in the country for conservative values, 
especially opposition to abortion. The coalition's success has troubled other
Christians who agree with many of its objectives, but are uncomfortable with
its partisianship, and with what seems to many critics its divisiveness and its
neglect of the poor. One group of coalition critics is the Call to Renewal. 
It heard today from children's advocate Marian Wright Edelman."
<P>
    Abernethy went on to look at Jim Wallis of Sojourners, a left-wing 
crusade. He never got to any "conservative Christians."
<P>
 Let me summarize the differences in approach to one major candidate 
failing to appear at one of the conventions:
<P>
<OL>
    <LI> Dole's snub is big news. Clinton's is not.
    <LI> Dole's decision was "an insult to all African American voters." 
Clinton's was not an insult to all Christian-American voters.
    <LI> Dole's address to the Christian Coalition "might send the wrong message 
to moderate, swing voters." Clinton's appearance before the left-wing NAACP did 
not.
    <LI> Dole's speech prompted NBC to air a bizarre story citing only liberals 
about how the Christian Coalition does not represent all conservative Christians, 
many of whom are "troubled" by its policy views. Clinton's NAACP address did 
not prompt NBC to do a story on how the NAACP does not represent all liberal 
African-Americans or even all African-Americans, nor any consideration of how 
the NAACP's policies "trouble" anyone.
</OL>
<P>
    Tom Brokaw insisted at a June National Press Club appearnace: "We've 
worked very hard to drain the bias out of what we do." Hard to tell.

	Bob Dole demanded that Bill Clinton release his medical records and complained that Clinton's
ads were little more than character assassination. Instead of examining the tone of Clinton ads, 
ABC and CBS portrayed Dole as the villain who has dirtied the until now clean campaign. Only
NBC looked at Clinton's role. On ABC's World News Tonight, Peter Jennings announced: "The campaign for President took a 
nasty turn today. First, Bob Dole departed from his standard stump speech in Kentucky, lashing out
at the Democrats for what he says they are saying about him, and negative advertising was the kindest 
thing Mr. Dole had to say." Reporter Jim Wooten showed clips of Dole complaining about Clinton and of Dole raising the medical records issue. Then he explained:
<P>
<DD>		"Press Secretary McCurry was asked by reporters today if the
		records would show indication of a number of diseases, including
		a sexually transmitted one. He said, no."
<P>
McCurry: "This has been put into play no doubt by those who seek to destroy the President. The President's physician reported on May 24th of this year he was in excellent overall health. Shecould not have done that if any of the allegations about diseases were true."
<P>
Wooten, concluding his piece: "It was bound to come to this no doubt as Senator Dole has been under considerable pressure from his campaign tacticians to begin attacking the President on
issues of personal character. So far he's resisted. Today may have been a signal that he's changing his mind."
<P>
  <DD><I>  So Dole's to blame for a reporter asking about a "sexually
transmitted" disease.</I>
<P>
    Then, Peter Jennings got to the second part of the how the campaign "took a nasty turn today" premise. Immediately after Wooten
finished he introduced the next story: "The President is going to
come under further Republican attack with the release next week
of the House Committee on Government Operations and Oversight's
report on the firings at the White House travel office."
  <P>  On the CBS Evening News Dan Rather followed the same Clinton
as victim theme: "Now for his part, Bob Dole re-opened one of his
favorite lines of attack today about President Clinton's health
records. Phil Jones is our man with the Dole campaign, Phil."
Jones provided a very short piece which dealt only with the
medical records issue, and concluded: "Dan, this campaign is
headed exactly where everybody expected it to go: personal..."
  Only NBC Nightly News bothered to show viewers what so upset
Dole. Tom Brokaw declared: "Bob Dole on the ropes and looking for
a way to boost his sagging campaign made it clear today he is
taking off the gloves in the war of the political airwaves."
    Reporter David Bloom began: "Stung by a barrage of negative
television advertising, Bob Dole today accused Bill Clinton of
running a campaign of fear, of engaging in character
assassination."
    After a clip of Dole, Bloom continued: "At the Democratic
National Convention two weeks ago the President made this
pledge:"<P>
<BR>
<DD>Clinton: "This must be a campaign of ideas, not a campaign of
insults. The American people deserve it."
<DD>Bloom: "But since then, the Dole camp claims the Democrats have
run only 42 positive ads with
<DD> 4,200 negative ads running across
the country."<BR>
<P>
Clips of Clinton ads, including: "If Dole sits here [Oval Office]
and Gingrich runs Congress what could happen. Medicare slashed. A
woman's right to choose gone."
  <P>
  Following another Dole soundbite of Dole and reaction from
the Clinton campaign, Bloom concluded: 
"Dole aides say the campaign will double its ad budget next
week, unveiling new attack ads blaming Clinton for rising teen
drug use, ads even tougher than this one."
Ad: "Bill Clinton said he'd lead the war on drugs and change
America. All he did was change his mind."
Bloom then ended his story by forwarding the "nasty" theme: "At a
Dole rally today the music blared 'get ready.' Get ready, that
is, for a very nasty campaign."

The Pew Research Center for the People and the
Press will be releasing the results of their survey of 1,508
people. Here are some of the more interesting findings:
<P>
<BR>
-- All in all, how would you rate the job the press has done
in covering the presidential campaign so far?
<P>
<DD>          44% Good
<DD>          29% Only fair
<DD>          13% Excellent
 <DD>         11% Poor
<P>
-- How much influence do you think news organizations have on
which candidate becomes President? (Posed only to the 1,141
registered voters in the sample)
<P>
<DD>          64% Too much
<DD>          30% About the right amount
<DD>           4% Too little
<P>
-- Would you say the press has been fair or unfair in the way
it has covered Bill Clinton's election campaign? (Again,
registered voters only, but this time sample of 565)
<P> 
 <DD>        67% Fair
     <DD>     24% Unfair
<P>
    -- Would you say the press has been fair or unfair in the way
it has covered Bob Dole's election campaign? (565 registered
voters)
<P>
       <DD>    65% Fair
<DD>           25% Unfair
<P>
    -- Who do you think most newspaper reporters and TV
journalists want to see win the presidential election -- Bill
Clinton, Bob Dole or Ross Perot? (Posed to sample size of 576)
<P>
         <DD>  59% Clinton
           <DD>17% Dole
<DD>            1% Perot
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
    So, the media are fair in coverage of both candidates, but the
public thinks that the media have too much influence on who wins and
perceives that reporters hope Clinton will win. Very confusing. --

<h4>Final Report on 1996 Television Network Convention Coverage:<br>

TV Analysts Label Democrats Twice as Often, But Fire Liberal
Questions<br>
Both Parties Too Conservative for the Networks</h4>
</center>

    Alexandria, VA -- The television networks substantially
increased the number of labels they applied to Democrats during
their 1996 convention over 1992, but at both the Republican and
Democratic conventions this year the networks demanded answers
to a barrage of questions from the left. For Republicans
gathered in San Diego, GOP intolerance on abortion was the
issue. For Democrats convened in Chicago, going too far to the
right on welfare reform became the media focus. Adding up both
questions and statements made by reporters to one another,
abortion or exclusion of pro-choice voices were raised as an
issue 55 times in San Diego, while viewers heard about welfare
reform 43 times in Chicago.<p>

    After producing a daily Media Reality Check '96 newsletter
during the August political conventions, the Media Research
Center's (MRC) news division staff organized its analysis of
prime time coverage into this special 15-page report. This
analysis covers ABC, CBS, CNN (starting at 8pm ET), NBC and the
joint NBC/PBS broadcast.<p> 

    <b>Key findings:</b><br>
<ul>
 <li>Democrats labeled liberal more often than Republicans tagged
conservative. Studies of the 1984, 1988 and 1992 conventions
found Republicans labeled much more frequently than Democrats.
In 1992, the MRC determined the networks applied 118
conservative labels during the GOP conclave, but just 38 liberal
labels during the Democratic gathering. This year, Republicans
were tagged 59 times (13 moderate, 30 conservative, and 16 more
extremist terms), but Democrats were labeled 119 times (44
moderate, 71 liberal and four more extremist terms).<p>

    In Chicago, Bill Clinton got 28 moderate labels and captured
about half as many liberal tags with 16. In San Diego, the
networks focused most of their labeling on conservative
delegates and speakers as Bob Dole went largely untagged --
three moderate and two conservative labels. The Republican
platform was never called moderate and the Democratic platform
was never described as liberal. See page 3 for a summary table
and graph, pages 6-14 for examples.<p>

<li>Convention attendees pummeled with questions from the left
side of the political spectrum. On 51 occasions in San Diego
Republicans were hit with questions from the left, especially
about intolerance and abortion, but they heard just six
inquiries from the right. Two weeks later instead of questioning
Democrats from the right, the networks posed 47 from the left,
the vast majority on how many Democrats opposed President
Clinton's decision to sign the welfare reform bill, but just 11
questions from the right. In this area the networks have grown
more biased. Four years ago, while the GOP got the same
treatment, hearing 131 questions from the left compared to 17
from the right, Democrats got a more even going over with 46
questions from the left and 38 from the right. See page 4 for a
table and graph, pages 7-15 for examples.<p>

<li>Republicans blamed repeatedly for displaying a negative
tone, but Democrats go unscathed despite some pretty vitriolic
speeches. In San Diego the networks characterized Republicans
with terms like "negative," "harsh," "strident" or "mean" or
described GOP speeches as an "attack," 34 times. Democrats were
hit with the negative descriptions just six times during their
convention, but even in Chicago Republicans got hammered more
with 23 references to GOP negativity. In 1992, the networks
questioned the Republican tone as too negative 70 times, but
never once raised the subject against Democrats at their
convention. See page 5 for a summary table and examples of the
contrast.<p>

<li>Controversies such as Whitewater and Travelgate barely
acknowledged. The Clintons are under active investigation by an
independent counsel, but the networks made only seven references
to Democratic scandals. NBC and the joint NBC-PBS broadcast
aired two mentions; ABC, CBS, and CNN, only one. Topics never
mentioned: the FBI files scandal, the Iran-Bosnia scandal, and
the special counsel investigations of Cabinet members such as
Henry Cisneros and Mike Espy. Controversies about Republicans,
such as questions about Elizabeth Dole's blind trust, were also
ignored.
</ul>

<center>
<h3><a name="best">Best</a> and Worst, from page 2 of the 15 page report:</h3>
</center>

<b>Best Network: ABC News </b><br>
    Posed the fewest ideological questions at both conventions,
had the least disparity in blaming the parties for being too
negative and, given the amount of airtime, were the most willing
to identify Democrats as liberal.<p>

<B>Worst Network: CNN</B><br>
    Failed to take advantage of their added airtime to offer
viewers something beyond just more of what the other networks
showed. CNN had the greatest disparity in the agenda of
questions posed, with 23 from the left to just three from the
right.<p>

<B>Best reporters</B><br>
<ul>
<li><B>Sam Donaldson, ABC News:</B> In San Diego he refrained from
gratuitous attacks on the Republicans for being too intolerant.
In Chicago, on the first day of the convention, Donaldson
offered a balanced appraisal of the party delegates, noting that
the Democratic delegates "are far to the left of the mainstream
just as the Republicans were to the right of the mainstream." In
the midst of hoopla over Bill Clinton's speech, only Donaldson
realized that while he gave a "great speech," the "record shows
that the next day he may give a different speech, change his
mind, trim it a little bit, do something else."<p>

 <li><B>Lisa Myers, NBC News: </B>One of the few reporters to pose
questions from both the left and right. In San Diego, she asked
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison from the right about how she "has
generally opposed efforts to cut off benefits to illegal
immigrants, particularly education and health benefits. Why
would hardworking American taxpayers pay for people who are here
illegally?" Then she asked her about how people who saw her
speech "found it too negative. They didn't particularly like the
degree to which you attacked the President. In retrospect, do
you think you went too far?" On the first night in Chicago,
Myers quizzed a delegate about whether liberals or New Democrats
control the party.<p> 

 <li><B>Brian Ross, ABC News:</B> Although CNN's Brooks Jackson appeared
early in prime time with stories on corporate contributions and
union influence, ABC's Ross deserves recognition despite the
fact his pieces did not air in prime time. In a series of World
News Tonight stories, Ross went after the big money contributors
to both parties. Ross raised unique issues, such as "the giant
media corporations...very much in the middle of the mix." In San
Diego he noted that "the ABC hospitality suite was a lobbyist's
dream." In Chicago he looked at one big donor: "His name is
Arthur Coia, who despite being president of a labor union the
FBI says has long been controlled by the Mafia...has become one
of the Democrats' top money people."<p>
</ul>

<B>Worst reporters:</B><br>
<ul>
 <li><B>Maria Shriver, NBC News:</B>  Seemed baffled why a rape victim
would have anything to do with the GOP and her interview with
Hillary Clinton following the First Lady's address was more like
two old friends sharing tales of their suffering than a
dispassionate interview. Just after Jan Licence addressed
Republicans about victim's rights, Shriver asked her: "But why
[speak] at a Republican convention? So many people have said
that they don't think this ticket, or perhaps this party, is
supportive of women's issues. Why make this stand here?"
Shriver's interview with the First Lady assumed Mrs. Clinton had
been unfairly attacked by Republicans. Shriver posed questions
like, "This has been a difficult couple of years for you. Did
that applause, the way you've been treated here, the way people
have been reacting to you, kind of make it all go away?" And,
noting GOP criticism of her book, Shriver wondered, "How did
that affect you when you heard about that?"<p>

<li><B>Judy Woodruff, CNN:</B> In San Diego she demanded that
Republicans explain why there weren't more female delegates, but
in Chicago instead of challenging Democrats on the appeal of
their pro-partial birth abortion stand, she worried about
welfare reform going too far. Woodruff peppered Mrs. Clinton
with six welfare questions, all from the left. She pleaded with
her to stop it: "Eleanor Roosevelt, whom you admire, mentioned
her again just now, said that much of the time she kept her
disagreements with the President to herself in private, but
there were times that she felt it was important to disagree
publicly. Does there ever come a time with you, and if not
welfare reform, then what?"<p>

<li><B>Tom Brokaw, NBC News:</B> Found Republican speakers threatened
to be perceived as too mean, took a pot shot at Ronald Reagan,
and portrayed Republicans as insensitive to rape, but praised
the speaking power of Democrats. In San Diego he warned that the
GOP knows "it has to lower the threshold of perceived meanness
on the part of the country." In Chicago, after Jesse Jackson's
speech which attacked conservatives, he admired how his words
grew "out of a very deep passion." Brokaw did at least mention
Whitewater in Chicago, but after the moving tribute to Ronald
Reagan in San Diego he took this swipe: "Ronald Reagan will have
to learn how history will judge his time in office -- the
deficits, the Iran-Contra affair." At the GOP conclave he told
rape victim Jan Licence: "This is a party that is dominated by
men," so, he wondered, "do you think before tonight they ever
thought about what happens in America with rape?"

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=6 FACE="Century Gothic">The Decline of the
Family Hour<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
Not so long ago the first hour of each night's prime time television
schedule -- the so-called Family Hour -- was reserved for wholesome
programs. This is now a thing of the past, mostly crowded out
by sexy sitcoms and steamy soaps, the likes of which as a rule
used to air later at night.
<P>
How much has the family hour changed since it was dominated by
such series as <I>Little House on the Prairie</I> and <I>The Cosby
Show</I>? In September and October of 1995, the Media Research
Center examined four weeks of 8-to-9-p.m. programming to determine
how much of it was, in fact, suitable for the entire family. We
found that very little of it was.
<P>
Among the study's findings:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Monotype Sorts">n</FONT>  Vulgar language,
usually unheard even late in prime time a few years back, is now
constant in the 8 p.m. hour. In 117 hours of programming, 72 curse
words were used. &quot;Ass&quot; (29 uses) &quot;bitch&quot; (13)
and &quot;bastard&quot; (10) were the most popular.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Monotype Sorts">n</FONT>  NBC was by far the
most vulgar of the networks. It had 1.26 obscenities for every
hour of &quot;Family Hour&quot; programming, more than double
the ratio of any other network. NBC's worst offenders were <I>Mad
About You</I>, with seven curse words, and <I>JAG</I>, with six.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Monotype Sorts">n</FONT>  Sexual material that
formerly was restricted to the 9-to-11 slot has migrated to the
&quot;Family Hour,&quot; where premarital sex is not only common
-- outnumbering portrayals of sex within marriage by a 8-to-1
ratio -- but almost always condoned. 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Monotype Sorts">n</FONT>  Fox had the most
sexual treatments per hour of any network (0.88), though all four
major networks were closely bunched in this category.
<P>
The networks' attempt to appeal to young adults has left children
(and their parents) underserved. The study's first recommendation
is a short-term, partial solution to this problem: one network
should counter the adult trend by offering family-oriented programming
between 8 and 9 throughout the week. 
<P>
In the long term, however, the goal should be for all networks
to voluntarily provide the viewing public with the across-the-board
haven it once counted on, and to broadcast in the first hour of
prime time only shows that parents and children can watch together.

<p>

<dd>When the American people gave Republicans the majority in both houses of Congress in 1994, many journalists and pundits called it a sea change, a transformation of the political landscape brought about by an upsurge of voter discontent.

<p>
<dd> In 1996, President Clinton was re-elected on a campaign platform that echoed much of the GOP agenda, and Republicans retained their majorities in both Houses for the first time since 1928. It is clear that American politics and government are being transformed not by sudden upheaval, but by the steady current of common-sense conservatism.
<p>

<dd> There is no longer any question that the nation wants smaller and more effective government, lower taxes, and a return to the values of freedom and responsibility. Exit polls from the election show that more voters identify themselves as conservative than liberal by a margin of almost two to one.

<p>

</table>

<p>

<dd> It is now up to elected officials on both halves of the political spectrum to fulfill the expectations so clearly expressed by American voters. Both presidential candidates campaigned on conservative principles, as did most winning candidates for House and Senate seats, Republican and Democrat alike.

<p>

<dd> One of the first priorities of the 105th Congress will be to work with the moderate Democrats who campaigned on conservative principles. Since the election, I have made more than 30 calls to the more moderate of the Democratic members of Congress to invite them to work with us on reforms at a pace the president can handle. We learned in the last Congress that Bill Clinton can't take change in big doses, and we'll continue to reduce wasteful Washington spending and unnecessary government programs, although at a somewhat slower pace.

<p>

<dd> The American people returned a Republican majority in both chambers in part because they know they can trust Republicans to hew to a conservative path and hold Bill Clinton to his campaign promises. One priority of the next Congress will be to help Bill Clinton keep the promises he has made to the American people.

<p>

<dd> Last year, Bill Clinton responded to the conservative call to balance the budget by promising voters a balanced budget with family tax relief. By law, he is supposed to submit a budget proposal to Congress in early February. We will thoroughly examine the president's budget to ensure that it lives up to the promises he made during the campaign. Now that the GOP has retained a majority in the House and increased its majority in the Senate, the president will find it difficult to back out of a real balanced budget agreement. And with the addition of two more GOP Senators, the American people are virtually assured passage of a Balanced Budget Amendment in the 105th Congress, perhaps even with the president's support.
   
<p>

<dd>The president has promised to get tough on crime and drugs, two of the biggest threats to America's families. The Republican Congress will make certain that crime stays on the top of the president's post-election agenda, and that during Bill Clinton's second term the nation will take the necessary steps to stem illegal drug use among our children.

<p>

<dd> Bill Clinton also promised to save Medicare from bankruptcy without imposing any untenable hardships upon Medicare recipients. As the polemics of this last election showed, Medicare can be used as a powerful political tool, but we will ensure that the long-term solvency of the program and the needs of Medicare recipients will supersede politics.

<p>

<dd> With its continued majorities in both houses, the Republican Congress will also be able to pursue those issues that speak to American families and their values, including -- with the stronger majority in the Senate -- an increased likelihood that we will be able to override the president's veto of the ban on partial-birth abortions. And, as promised by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a vote on a constitutional amendment to limit congressional terms will be the first substantive vote of the 105th Congress.

<p>

<dd>We will also move forward on Superfund reform so that the money now going to lawyers will go instead to speed the cleanup of toxic waste in neighborhoods across America. Building on last year's historic welfare reform, we will continue to replace dependency with opportunity through enterprise zones, public housing reforms, and opportunity scholarships. And now that we've seen union officials openly trying to buy Congress and foreign interests trying to buy the White House, we must address the role of money in politics before the next election.

<p>

<dd> The 105th Congress will also continue to maintain and develop effective congressional oversight and review of the executive branch. One of Congress's key constitutional responsibilities is to assess whether government programs work and how they might be improved.

<p>

<dd> The move toward conservative government has been a steady tide, and the 1996 elections exposed the erosion of support for decades of liberal policies. For the first time in many years, we will see not a battle between liberal ideas and conservative principles, but rather a debate over how to apply conservative principles to repair the damage caused by decades of Big Government liberalism.

<p>

<dd> Elected officials no longer argue over whether to balance the budget, but how and when; not over whether to shrink the size of the government, but by how much and to what aim; not over whether to eliminate harmful welfare programs, but over how best to end the cycle of dependency and reward work and personal responsibility.

<p>

<dd> Conservatives should be pleased that common-sense conservatism has occupied the center of political debate. There is no longer any argument over whether the American people want to move our country in a more conservative direction; only a debate over how quickly we can get there.

<p>

<dd>The lesson of the election is this: there will be no end to the era of Big Government until there is a Republican president, and there will be no Republican president until conservatives can say what America will look like in the post-Big Government era. The voters knew what they were doing. They elected a Democratic president who said the era of Big Government is over and, for insurance, a Republican Congress that actually believes it. They refused to put conservatives completely in charge because President Clinton persuaded enough voters that a Republican government would make tomorrow worse than today for everyone, except perhaps for men making more than $75,000 a year. So in the time of great change, the voters made sure not much will change.

<p>

<dd>The worst mistake conservatives could make would be to back away from a bold agenda. The country is moving our way. If we want to be a governing party instead of a congressional party, we must learn to paint a conservative picture of the future in a more compelling way than liberals paint theirs. All our recent presidential losses  --  1976, 1992, and 1996  --  have come because of our failure to do just that.

<p>

<dd>Our success has, in part, been our undoing. In 1964, Ronald Reagan defined our twin enemies: an evil empire abroad and an arrogant empire at home. Now we have won. The Cold War is over and the end of the era of Big Government has been proclaimed. In defeating our enemies, we have become good at saying what we are against, but not at saying what we are for. 
        
<p>

<dd>Our task is harder than that of liberals. Their message of hope is a feint to the right plus a trivial federal program. Our message of hope is a real step to the right plus a dose of inconvenience: expect less from government and more of ourselves. Our message is a lot of trouble. It would be nice to be able to hire someone else  --  say, the government  --  to save our children from drugs, make our streets safer, strengthen our families, and restore our values. But only we can. Our advantage is that our message of hope actually works.

<p>

<dd>We conservatives have our work cut out for us. We must learn to say what we are for in plain words. We need choir practice. We sing the right song, but we are embarrassingly out of tune when we get to the part about the future. Sometimes the voters must listen to us and think we don't have a clue. We need to stop sounding like a convention of Washington lawyers who have not yet heard, for example, that family life is harder because schools close at 3 p.m. and parents work until 5:30.        
        <p><dd>

Bob Dole was at his best when he explained that his tax cut would pay for four months of day care at Casey's General Store Child Development Center, in Ankeny, Iowa. The working mother at Casey's didn't need to believe in the tax cut to vote for Senator Dole. She did need to believe that he understood her struggles with day care. Eliminating the U.S. Department of Education and encouraging home schooling alone do not answer the education question for about 90 percent of American families. We must paint a vivid picture of how we will help create the best schools in the world.
        <p><dd>

In Congress, the greatest opportunities for conservatives are: (1) Enact the Balanced Budget Amendment; (2) make welfare reform work; (3) cut the capital gains tax in half; (4) eliminate chunks of overbearing laws and regulations and start over; (5) create a citizens' Congress with term limits. With a Democratic president, I hold no hope for two of the most important initiatives: a new tax system (I favor two low rates and just a few deductions) and a GI Bill for Kids that would convert federal money now spent on programs into scholarships that middle- and low-income students could use at any school.
        <p><dd>

The most ominous liberal initiatives? (1) Supreme Court Justice appointments; (2) a tilt toward labor; (3) more federal control of local schools.
<p><dd>

        I worry far less about what Bill Clinton will do than about what we will fail to do. We could become comfortable as a congressional party, a perpetual Republican insurance policy against the excesses of a moderate Democratic president. Some conservatives are even suggesting that the presidency has become miniaturized, barely worth having. This is very dangerous thinking.
        <p><dd>
The president's job is to recognize our urgent needs, develop strategies to deal with them, and to persuade at least half of us that he is right. The president should be the nation's agenda setter. Conservatives should see as indispensable a strong Republican president who can tell us where we are going and how we will get there. Without such a president, this country will never see a new tax system, parental choice among the best schools, a strengthening of national defense and of families, a balanced budget, or an end to the era of Big Government. 
        <p><dd>

What I fear most about Bill Clinton's second term as president is that conservatives will fail to do what is necessary to persuade at least half the people that tomorrow will be better than today only if we expect less of government and more of ourselves.

        The election of 1996 confirmed that the Reagan Republican coalition is the natural governing majority in the United States. In January, Republicans will hold a majority in the House of Representatives, an increased majority in the Senate, the governorships of 32 states that represent 75 percent of American voters, 51 percent of state legislative seats outside the South, and unified control of the governorship and state legislature in 12 states (compared with complete Democratic control in six).
<p><dd>
        Bill Clinton's re-election with a 49 percent plurality does not mitigate the depth of conservative strength any more than Eisenhower's twin victories or Nixon's 1972 landslide hindered the growth of government and the consolidation of the welfare state.

If the AFL-CIO spent a mere 10 percent of its members' dues on political activities this year, then it spent $600 million in "soft money," "volunteer" staff time, and phone and photocopy costs to supplement the well-publicized commitment of $35 million in television, radio, and mail attacks upon Republican representatives. Yet even this tsunami of money from unions, environmental groups, and even foreign interests could not erode the firmly entrenched gains of the Republican Party at all levels of government.
        <p><dd>
The failure of the Dole candidacy does not indicate that the tax issue has lost its potency. The 105th Congress will have 200 House members and 44 Senators who have signed and campaigned on the Taxpayer Protection Pledge against raising income taxes. And more than 700 state legislators have signed the state Taxpayer Protection Pledge forswearing <I>any</I> tax hike. Initiatives placed before voters on November 5 also spoke loudly to the tax issue: Florida voted to require a two-thirds supermajority of the people to enact any new constitutionally imposed tax  --  in effect, any state income tax. Nevada voted to require a two-thirds vote of the state legislature to enact any tax increase. South Dakota voted to require either a majority vote of the people or a two-thirds vote of the legislature for any tax increase. California voted to require a vote of the people for any local tax increase. Florida voters rejected a penny a pound tax on sugar to "save" the Everglades. Nebraska voters defeated an initiative sponsored by the teachers union to make "quality education" a "fundamental constitutional right." Oregon voted down an effort to expand a light-rail system.
        <p><dd>
Conservatives have several opportunities in the 105th Congress. First, corporate welfare spending should be eliminated. The abolition of corporate welfare spending saves taxpayers money, eliminates a source of corruption, and reduces the role of government in the economy.
        <p><dd>
The labor unions' misuse of compulsory union dues to play politics gives Republicans an opportunity to recreate the Kefauver Commission that examined corruption in labor unions in the 1950s. The <I>Beck</I> decision by the Supreme Court in 1988 specifically forbids the use of compulsory union dues for purposes beyond the negotiation and maintenance of a member's contract. Yet the Clinton administration refuses to enforce this right of workers and the labor union bosses have unconstitutionally spent money that does not belong to them. Congress must shine some sunlight on the inner workings of this corruption.
        <p><dd>
And Congress should continue three crusades. First, school choice: Clinton will veto a plan to give America's poorest families control over their education. But let's make this father of a child in private school publicly and repeatedly expose his own hypocrisy. Second, tort reform: Clinton's party is owned by the trial lawyers. Make him sing for his supper and publicly admit that he is bought and paid for by vetoing reform measure after reform measure. And third, the Republican leadership in the House has promised a vote every April 15 on a constitutional amendment to require a supermajority of two-thirds to raise any tax. Congress should continue this anniversary tradition.
        <p><dd>
The experience of the 104th Congress teaches us to continue to push for a balanced budget by 2002 with tax cuts. Placed in this box, Clinton cannot expand government and must reduce both discretionary spending and entitlement costs. In just two years, with this strategy, Republicans ended two seemingly immortal programs: the welfare entitlement and farm subsidies. And Republicans should continue to be both persistent and patient. The welfare state was not built in two years. It will not fall to the forces of freedom in two, four, or even six years.
        <p><dd>
The greatest dangers of a Clinton second term are his judicial appointments, his vacillation in world affairs, and his willingness to abuse and corrupt the FBI and the IRS to attack and harass his political enemies. Republicans will have to work hard and learn fast to ensure that our foreign policy does not implode and to keep Clinton's bureaucracy from continuing to misuse its power.

<p><dd>
        For the first time in 60 years, a majority friendly to small business has taken root in Congress. As measured by National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB), the 103rd Congress voted with small business about 55 percent of the time. That number shot up to 70 percent in the 104th Congress. We expect it to be even higher in the 105th Congress.
        <p><dd>

The 104th Congress was gratifying for those of us who spent the last 40 years fighting the legislation of anti-business majorities. At the end of the 104th Congress, NFIB recognized a record number of "Guardians of Small Business": members of Congress who voted with small business at least 70 percent of the time. But the 104th Congress was by no means perfect. It was necessarily partisan, and its reform-by-leaps agenda provoked opposition from the press and the White House. We at NFIB hope to see a more incremental approach to reform in the 105th Congress and a bipartisan approach to passing conservative legislation. 
        <p><dd>

The new Congress will have the opportunity to address fundamental issues such as tax reform, increased affordability and availability of health care, reform of the civil-justice system, elimination of the death (estate) tax for the family farm, ranch, and business, relief of crushing and unnecessary business regulations, and balancing the federal budget. The incremental steps on tax reform and health-care reform made at the end of the 104th Congress laid the groundwork for more changes in the 105th.
        <p><dd>

I am optimistic about this second term, based on President Clinton's statements during the campaign, in which he often mentioned small business, and his appointment of Erskine Bowles, former head of the Small Business Administration, as White House chief of staff. 
        <p><dd>

However, we are urging small-business owners to be alert to small steps by the administration that, taken together, could result in health-care "reforms" that kill businesses by a thousand cuts. We hope President Clinton will not seek to enhance his legacy by increasing mandated health benefits, loading the costs of those mandates on the backs of hardworking small-business owners and their families. This is not the way to make health care more available or affordable, and it would destroy jobs and endanger the health of our economy.
        <p><dd>

The president has indicated he wants to expand the Family and Medical Leave Act. This, too, would be an unnecessary mandate on small business. It will be a sad day in America when we need the government to facilitate parent-teacher meetings or doctors' visits. In small business, employees are often the family members of the owner, and those who are not family members are nevertheless treated as such. Small-business owners and their employees get along very nicely without help from Washington.
        <p><dd>

Congress should fight such mandates by simply drawing a line in the sand. Tell the president, with all due respect, that he cannot dictate the way Americans run their lives, and that he cannot pay for government solutions with payroll taxes. Conservatives need to build a bipartisan coalition that will turn back every attempt to expand the role of government and prevent the cumulative effect of a thousand deadly cuts.

        In 1994, the American electorate put liberalism to the sword and severely wounded the Democratic Party. The results were a clear mandate for change, but euphoric Republicans mistook it as a mandate for revolution. Now the 1996 election results are in, President Clinton has been re-elected, and the opportunity for swift and total change is over.

<dd>
        This is not to say that the country is any less conservative in 1996 than in 1994 or that the Republican Party is no longer in ascendance. In fact, the policies that President Clinton ostensibly embraced during his re-election campaign are clear evidence that conservatism is still setting the political and economic agenda in America and will do so for the foreseeable future.
        <p><dd>
The electorate's conservatism, however, is instinctive, not logically consistent or intellectually rigorous. The election of 1996 should remind conservatives that American voters generally care less about ideological labels and the impassioned pursuit of principle than about "getting the job done." The American people want their children to learn in school, they want to feel secure in their homes, they want to know they will be cared for in their old age, and they want a culture and economy that is family-friendly. Policy people and politicians covered in the dust and sweat of the arena may rejoice at calling this "conservatism." Average Americans call it looking out for their loved ones and their pocketbooks. 
        <p><dd>
On Election Day, the American people chose a president who worked hard to show he was looking out for their loved ones and their pocketbooks, too. Although conservatives may have had better ideas, Bill Clinton had compassion. He came across as the family physician, while conservatives were portrayed as eager surgeons. 
        <p><dd>
In the end, we failed to explain why our policies for devolution and privatization and less government were more compassionate. Ultimately, that is the reason why the electorate settled for the therapeutic model of Clinton's "Little Things Presidency," based on concerns like school uniforms, teenage smoking, illiteracy, and church burnings.
        <p><dd>
Voters may have reined in the Republican Party in 1996, but they objected less to the substance than to presentation and pace. The message from the American people is this: "Go ahead, but go slow. Offer us a competing vision that is convincingly compassionate, not cavalier. If you are saying less government is compassionate, tell us why. And, be careful on Medicare, on devolution of power to the states, on deregulation of the American economy, and a host of other issues. We only put Bill Clinton there to act as an emergency brake on any rash moves by a Republican Congress."
        <p><dd>
Humility, rhetorical moderation, and patience are the principal lessons that conservatives in the 105th Congress should learn from the failures and successes of the 104th. There is no presidential campaign on the horizon, so the 105th Congress should focus on policy, not personalities. It should aim to improve the lives of the average American by applying conservative principles to government policy, not by pillorying Bill Clinton. If the president wants to join in -- or even lead -- a conservative initiative, then conservatives should welcome him to the team. And whenever he reverts to his liberal instincts, conservatives should oppose him fiercely but without the bombast, arrogance, and hard-edged ideological rhetoric that so colored public perceptions of GOP legislative controversies during the first Clinton administration.
        <p><dd>
In terms of legislative opportunities, conservatives must defend welfare reform from the attacks that will inevitably follow Bill Clinton's reelection. Tax cuts and continued deregulation of the economy must remain priorities. The devolution of power to the states on everything from education to Medicaid must go forward. Term limits and a Balanced Budget Amendment are certain winners with the public and good policy to boot. And ensuring the financial stability of Medicare without alienating older voters or increasing taxes remains the Gordian knot of national politics. 
        <p><dd>
With or without a Republican Congress, the presidency is still the most powerful office in the world. There are other, more discreet ways for the president to advance a liberal agenda. The "gays in the military" policy was decreed by executive order, as were most of his foreign policy and national security initiatives. And, the president still retains the awesome power of appointing judges to the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts. A Clintonesque judiciary could undo conservative accomplishments in the Congress, in state legislatures, and through ballot initiatives. 
        <p><dd>
The 1996 elections were a lesson in compassion, not a repudiation of conservatism. We will achieve the dream of a generation of conservative governance once we offer our vision of effective compassion.

<dd>    Now, the people who brought us the Bush campaign of 1992 and the Dole campaign of 1996 are receding, temporarily, into the shadows. They have escaped, as Churchill would have said, "unsung and unhung." It is critically important that we conservatives understand why the Republicans lost in 1992 and 1996. If we listen to the liberal media, we will continue to make the disastrous mistakes that were made in these two dismal campaigns.

<dd>The morning after the election, a friend of mine told the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>: "The evolution of the Republican Party into a confident, conservative, aggressive, pro-family Southern and Western party is complete." I respect my friend's superb political skills, but this way of looking at the Republican future will only bring the party permanent minority status. Looking at the electoral maps of 1992 and 1996, we see that a party limited to the South and West will never regain the White House. Barry Goldwater joked about sawing off the Northeast, but Ronald Reagan carried New York and Massachusetts <I>twice</I>. I'll go with Reagan.

<p><dd>
        Our analysis of the 1996 results brings forth this startling conclusion: The GOP was defeated in the past two presidential elections because the Catholic vote collapsed. Exit polls will not tell us this. What we learn from them  --  and it is important  --  is who came to the polls and what they did. But the Family Research Council's examination of selected counties with high Catholic populations show that the GOP turned off huge numbers of Catholic voters who had been powerfully trending toward the conservative social positions of Ronald Reagan and George Bush in the 1980s. These counties may be the keys to the electoral lock.
        <p><dd>
It is not that Bill Clinton was so popular in these counties. (In many of them, Clinton's 1996 vote tally is little better than that of Michael Dukakis in 1988.) It is that the "bread alone" Republican campaigns of 1992 and 1996 were so unpopular. The GOP turned off voters by talking about money, only money, and avoiding family and social issues. The party must find a way to regain the support of "soccer moms," to be sure. But it can't afford to alienate the "bocce uncles" in ethnic Catholic communities either.
        <p><dd>
Partial-birth abortion is a horrific procedure. It shocks the conscience just to think of it. Even such liberals as Mary McGrory, Pat Moynihan, and Richard Cohen recoil from it. But Bill Clinton approves of it. His veto of the ban on partial-birth abortions was the cruelest act of any American president. Yet he paid no political price because the Dole-Kemp campaign refused to confront him about it. Joe Barrett, a perceptive analyst of the Catholic vote, says: "Bill Clinton knew the Republicans were afraid to confront him on partial-birth abortion. He knew he could get away with it." And he did. Dole might have turned to Clinton in the first debate and said: "You vetoed a bill to save unborn children at the very threshold of life. You approve of a procedure where the abortionist forces sharp scissors into the back of the child's skull and then inserts a catheter to suck out her brains. You say this is necessary because the child might have a handicap. Well, Mr. President, I know more about handicaps than you do. If I'm elected president, I'll sign that bill with my <I>left</I> hand."

<p><dd>
        On quotas and set-asides, Dole was not silent, only late and woefully incoherent. This is a powerful issue of justice. He could have made it a centerpiece of his national campaign. Instead, his message was garbled, confused, muted. Thus, while Dole got trounced in the Golden State, the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI) carried the state handily. Clinton was allowed to say he opposed quotas. When? The party that nominated him has imposed rigid quotas on its own delegations since 1972. His own Cabinet was an exercise in quota-mongering, employing the now famous formula: EGG  --  ethnicity, gender, geography.
        <p><dd>
The impact of these two vital issues on voters in crucial counties with large Catholic populations can only be imagined. Any inclination to write off the Northeast and Midwest, therefore, in the vain pursuit of a Southern and Western strategy must be resisted. 
        <p><dd>
Of course the Republican party must continue to be the party that Reagan built. Of course it must continue to strengthen its growing dominance in the South and West. It must stand for a strong defense, smaller government, and lower taxes. But it must stand for more than that. The sanctity of human life, the defense of marriage, the rebuilding of a vibrant and decent culture, these things matter most. If the Republicans cannot speak to these matters of the heart, they will never become the majority party. Indeed, the party may not survive at all.

<p><dd>
        The 1996 elections were a huge success for conservatives. The American electorate is still clearly trending to the right of center, and the 105th Congress will be the most conservative legislative body in the modern American political era. The newly elected Republican senators are decidedly more conservative than the Democrats (and Republicans) they replaced. 
        <p><dd>

The ideological makeup of the next Congress is no accident. The American people are telling Washington they still want a social safety net, but with greater emphasis on personal responsibility. They want a government that is smaller and more efficient. They are not comfortable with one-party control of the White House, Senate, and House because the GOP offered no vision and optimism in this election. But they overwhelmingly prefer a conservative direction to a liberal one. Just look at President Clinton's tack to the right in favor of a balanced budget, welfare reform that ends the federal entitlement to government assistance and shifts money and power back to the states, a tougher approach to crime, and even limited tax cuts. 
        

<p><dd>
Conservatives face a great opportunity now that Bill Clinton is worried about establishing his place in history and is willing to distance himself from congressional Democrats. We should, therefore, press for passage of a Balanced Budget Amendment (with a supermajority provision for boosting taxes), tax cuts, and entitlement reforms. 
        <p><dd>

True tax reform isn't likely with Bill Clinton in the White House. But the GOP must keep articulating a pro-growth vision for the future whose centerpiece is turning the initials "IRS" into "RIP"  --   Rest in Peace. In the interim, while we press for a capital-gains tax cut and a major increase in exemptions for children, we must keep our eye on the real goal: fundamentally overhauling the federal tax code and replacing it with a simple, fair, low flat tax. 

<p><dd>

        On Medicare, the GOP made an enormous mistake in the 104th Congress by constantly talking about increased deductibles, higher copayments, managed care, and "slowing the rate of growth." The key to communicating a positive message on Medicare reform is medical savings accounts. MSAs can give seniors more choices, more control, and more money in their pockets, without having to enter a dreaded HMO. We use a variation of MSAs at <I>Forbes</I> magazine. Even the United Mine Workers use MSAs. They work. It's time to make the case for MSAs before the American people. 
        

<p><dd>

It is also time to find our voice on Social Security reform. We must preserve the current system for those entering the system in the next 12 to 15 years. But we should start a new Social Security system for younger people, in which part of their payroll taxes would flow to their own Individual Retirement Account. Under this plan, they, not Washington politicians, would own the assets and invest them in the real American economy.
<p><dd>
Perhaps the most important lesson from the last Congress is that we must first explain to the American people the magnitude of the problems we want to solve before we try to legislate solutions. Next we must build support for our solutions by creating grassroots coalitions and getting our message directly to the public through paid advertising. 
<p><dd>
My biggest concern about the 105th Congress is that conservatives may lose their nerve. The status quo is our enemy. We should strive for steady progress over the next two years while we prepare public opinion for substantial reform of taxes and entitlements. We need to get back on offense, set the national agenda, and avoid getting sidetracked by liberals. For example, we shouldn't balk at trying to ban partial birth abortions. 
<p><dd>
        Congress will be tempted to place more limits on campaign giving. We tried that approach after Watergate and got the mess we have today. Instead, Congress should remove or substantially raise limits on individual giving as long as there is full and prompt disclosure. We should require independent campaign committees to make weekly disclosures of their spending and the sources of their money. Trust the voters to decide whether the candidate is selling his soul to some special interest. Do the same thing on campaign spending caps, which independent groups have already blown to smithereens. Stop the hypocrisy. 
        <p><dd>
The bottom line: Conservatives have a golden opportunity to force President Clinton to deliver on his conservative-sounding rhetoric. Carpe Diem.

        The conservative agenda of the 104th Congress was validated not only by the results of the 1996 election, but by the fact that President Clinton ran on much of the same platform. President Clinton knows a winning agenda when he sees it. What happens now? We carry it out. But this time, we must act as a long-term majority party. We must not act as though we have two years to win or lose. We will have to march to a more methodical pace.

<dd>As members of the first Republican Congress in 40 years, we changed the way Washington did business. Now both political parties agree that we must balance the budget by cutting spending, not by raising taxes. We all agree that the best decisions are made closest to the people, not by a remote government. We have all learned that the people want the government to perform its core functions better, and to stop wasting their money on programs that are no longer effective or necessary. Now most parts of the political spectrum supports a national effort to achieve strong families and revive "civil society" through personal responsibility and freedom.
        <p><dd>
This war of ideas is over. The people have chosen these ideas over bigger government. Now we must move patiently forward in implementing them.
        

<p><dd>

I see a number of opportunities for the 105th Congress. We must continue our push for a smaller, more focused, more efficient federal government concerned with core principles and functions. We should pass the Balanced Budget Amendment. We must also eliminate corporate welfare  --  those direct spending subsidies that only benefit very narrow groups. We should start by eliminating the two cabinet-level agencies that contain the most corporate welfare of all: the departments of Energy and Commerce. Obviously we must maintain the vital core programs of those agencies, including Nuclear Weapons Development, the National Weather Service, the Patent and Trademark Office, and the Census Bureau. But many others can be eliminated, privatized, or devolved to state and local levels of government. I support a proposal that would save $23 billion over five years by eliminating the Department of Energy and $6 billion for eliminating the Department of Commerce. These savings should be used to reduce the deficit and cut taxes.
<p><dd>

        Fundamental reform of the tax code and the IRS is also long overdue. Our tax code of 500 million words doesn't make sense to even the sharpest tax attorney. The code punishes families, entrepreneurs, and growth. There is also growing support in Congress to require every bill to cite precisely the constitutional authority for the statutory changes it proposes.
        

<p><dd>
My greatest fear for the 105th Congress is that the people elected on the conservative agenda will lose confidence in our own ideas even though they clearly reflect the direction the American people want to go. We should not retreat in the face of victory. We cannot afford, for the sake of our children, to continue spending as we have. We can preserve such programs as Medicare and student loans while still reducing government and adhering to core governing principles.
        

<p><dd>

I could not be more optimistic about the future of this nation. We are on the right track. We must press forward with confidence, compassion, wisdom, inclusiveness, and a smile. We must each look within ourselves for solutions to our terrible social problems of crime, loss of family, drugs, and welfare dependency. When we change individually, we will change the nation. I think people are beginning to realize that this, not more government, is the answer. This, above all else, is why the conservative movement is alive and well.

        We are in a dealignment, not a realignment. Old parties are weakening, many voters split tickets in pursuit of divided government, and new party loyalties are slow to form. The challenge for conservatives, then, is to articulate a simple, cogent message based on first principles and their applications to specific policies.

<dd>Please indulge a California example. The elections in our state were, in many instances, disappointing, with the Republicans losing their majority in the state assembly. But the silver lining was the passage of the California Civil Rights Initiative. CCRI will abolish race and gender preference programs sponsored by the state and local governments. The proponents' campaign was largely based on a single principle: It is wrong for a government to discriminate based on race. The underfunded campaign was led by a man of unwavering principle and an ability to articulate his principles in both speeches and soundbites. CCRI prevailed even in the face of a well-organized campaign of distortion abetted by the free media.
        <p><dd>
CCRI wasn't enough to deliver California to Dole. In fact, Dole's last-minute embrace of the bipartisan initiative probably drove away potential supporters, because his campaign egregiously mishandled the issue. If Dole had sparked a national conversation on the meaning of rights and citizenship in a free society, beginning at the Republican convention and continuing through the election, he would have done a great service to his party and his country.
        
<p><dd>

If conservatives are going to relimit government, or even halt the progress of Clinton's myriad of small welfare-state initiatives, they must convince the public that a government in a free society simply may not do certain things, even though some people would benefit from them. Affirmative action has benefited many people, proponents of racial preferences contend. The best response to this claim is not to deny it, but to ask, "So what?" It is wrong for the government to discriminate, therefore it should be proscribed from doing so.
        <p><dd>

This critique applies to many popular welfare-state initiatives, such as the recent debacle over raising the minimum wage, the violation by government of private-property rights, and intrusive education policies; conservatives must use it. Without a principled position, opponents of welfare-state programs easily yield to "yes, but": "<I>Yes</I>, I realize that all 212 federal job-training programs have been complete failures up to this point, <I>but</I> through careful study and the application of the latest social-science techniques, this latest one will succeed. Surely you don't deny there's a problem?"
<p><dd>

        The biggest danger facing Republicans in the 105th Congress is that they will be unable to fend off Clinton's endless string of targeted welfare-state programs, from expanded family leave, scholarships for community college students, mandates on health-care companies, health care for children, and so on. Aiding Clinton's cause is a sympathetic media establishment and a citizenry eager to receive its slice of the government pie. Our best hope of relimiting government is, as Amherst College professor Hadley Arkes is fond of saying, to start using principles we didn't even know we had.

        At the presidential level, Republicans proved in 1996 that you can't beat the Michael Jordan of political candidates with a tired Washington insider whose communication skills predated television, or even radio. At the congressional level, Republicans demonstrated they still have a chance to become a true majority party if they can convince Americans they are problem solvers and not merely stingy accountants obsessed with shrinking the federal fisc. We live in a post-partisan environment where it is difficult for a party to retain brand-name loyalty. Exit polls and the outcomes of various popular initiatives show the electorate often supports Republican solutions so long as they aren't identified with the GOP (as when Californians rejected higher tax rates on the rich while backing color-blind government).

<dd>Republicans need to show they really are for smaller government by abolishing the scandal-ridden Department of Commerce. Not only is the agency a slush fund for corporate welfare, but it also exemplifies the heart of campaign-finance scandals, which is the power of Washington to direct economic outcomes. Conservatives must also push to expand the concept of medical savings accounts that got a foot in the health-care door last year. The failures of the 104th Congress were writ in stone the day the Republicans decided not to take control of the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Tax Committee and adjust the ways they calculate budgetary and tax issues. They will continue to limit their liability to govern to the extent they leave the Congressional number-crunchers alone.
        <p><dd>
I worry that Republicans will try to bridge the gender gap by throwing many of their long-held principles into it. It's one thing to rethink how best to communicate why a smarter, smaller government can improve women's lives. It's quite another to buy Bill Clinton's salami-slice increases in state power because they fear the wrath of soccer moms and waitress moms. A majority of white women and married women voted Republican for Congress. There is no reason for panic on gender.
        <p><dd>
Unions  --  especially the teacher-monopolies that control public education  --  must be confronted. The last election proved they can't be placated. Congressional hearings and commissions must subpoena their records and expose how they spend their money. If just some of their members begin to publicly question where their dues are going, the unions' effectiveness in the 1998 elections and beyond can be curbed.
<p><dd>
        Finally, the GOP Congress must work even more closely with the 32 Republican governors to fashion legislation. Whether they cooperate and present a unified message to voters in the 1998 elections will dictate in large part if Republicans can cement and extend their grassroots gains.

<p><dd>
Two years ago, the Democratic Party was imploding. Democrats were losing elections almost everywhere. They even lost mayoral elections in Los Angeles, New York City, and Jersey City  --  places where there virtually are no Republicans. They had no platform and no agenda. They still have no platform and no agenda. Yet in 1996 they retained the White House, ran credible races for the U.S. House and Senate and gained 96 seats in state legislatures. How did this happen? 
<p><dd>
        There are three lessons for the GOP: (1) Message trumps no message; (2) at the margin, the female vote can be won with rhetoric and small policy changes; and (3) a new kind of strategic liberalism has emerged from the Democrats' desperate attempt to regain power. 
<p><dd><b>Message.</b> When Americans entered the voting booths last November 5, everyone remembered the Democratic message: Republicans want to cut spending for Medicare, Medicaid, and education in order to lower taxes on the rich. Very few people could remember Bob Dole's message. Why? A simple idea repeated over and over again is easily remembered, whereas complex ideas, each explained in many different ways, are not. 
<p><dd><b>Gender Gap. </b>
In the congressional elections, men favored Republicans by 9 percentage points; women favored Democrats by 10 points. Among suburbanites, men favored Republicans by 12 points; women favored Democrats by 6. Thus the gender gap can hurt either party. But Republicans must nevertheless be concerned. In 1996, many women who ordinarily might be expected to vote Republican (and whose husbands vote Republican) voted for a Democrat instead  --  perhaps supplying the margin of victory in many races. This tendency has deepened over time. Between 1992 and 1994, the preference for congressional Democrats grew from 6 to 10 percentage points among all women and switched from 6 points for Republicans to 6 points for Democrats among suburban women. 
<p><dd>

        What explains the gender gap? Apart from differences between the two parties over abortion, Democratic candidates repeatedly used the words "children" and "education" at their convention and in their campaigns, and addressed other issues of special concern to women. By all rights, candidates who are beholden to teachers unions should not be viewed as friends of children. Yet Bill Clinton successfully campaigned as the pro-education candidate. By contrast, Bob Dole's plan to abolish the U.S. Department of Education made him seem hostile to education. 
<p><dd>

        Clinton promised more money for breast cancer research and Internet access in all schools. He signed legislation to allow women to stay in the hospital for two days after childbirth. (In focus groups, women indicated that the two-day mandate was one of the most important reasons why they preferred Clinton.) President Clinton and Democratic congressional candidates also highlighted issues over which the federal government has virtually no control, such as school uniforms and report cards for schools. 
<p><dd>

        <b>Strategic Liberalism.</b> President Clinton may have declared that "the era of Big Government is over," but focus groups reveal that people do not equate health-insurance mandates with "Big Government." In this and in other areas, liberals have discovered that they can expand the power of government incrementally without appearing to be liberal, and can often woo women voters at the same time. 
<p><dd>

        During the campaign, the president demonstrated his capacity to advance ideas inconsistent with his own past positions and inimical to key constituencies in order to gain electoral advantage. The mandate for two-day hospital stays is a perfect example. It is completely inconsistent with the HillaryCare plan of 1993, which sought to encourage everyone to join health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and to allow health-care specialists to make such decisions based on medical needs and cost effectiveness. The mandate also goes against the president's managed competition constituency.
<p><dd>
        This is a new kind of liberalism. The old liberalism was special-interest liberalism. One could predict the agenda of old liberalism based on the demands of its special-interest constituents. Strategic liberalism is much harder to predict. Counterstrategies are much harder to devise. Moreover, since strategic liberalism involves a new way of thinking, initiatives could come from younger members of Congress rather than the leadership. Expect strategic liberals to begin the 105th Congress with mandates of special interest to women: annual mammograms with no deductible; no deductible for mastectomies; annual pap smears with no deductible; checkups for children with no deductible.
<p><dd>

        The onslaught will continue, as special interests descend on the Capitol: chiropractors, naturopaths, acupuncturists, <I>in vitro</I> fertilization centers, et cetera. At the same time, the administration will push for KidCare -- Hillary Clinton's health-care plan adapted for children. 
<p><dd><b>Conservative Response.</b> The conservative response to traditional liberalism has been a completely defensive strategy: resist and retreat, resist and retreat. This would be a disastrous response to strategic liberalism. Conservatives would die a death of a thousand cuts. After two years, marginal voters would come to believe that only liberal Democrats care about health care for women and children. 
<p><dd>

        The conservative counterstrategy must couple the traditional commitment to such "conservative" issues as lower taxes, deregulation, and privatization with a focus on such "liberal" concerns as health, education, environment, pensions, and other issues of interest to women. In each area, conservatives must offer an aggressive, free-enterprise agenda for solving problems.

        In 1994, conservatives were in a biblical frame of mind. After 40 years in the wilderness, House Republicans were finally crossing into the promised land of majority status. The 1996 election should prompt another look at the Bible, particularly the 41st chapter of Genesis. After Pharaoh discloses his dream about healthy cows and ears of grain consuming sickly ones, Joseph interprets its meaning: Egypt will enjoy abundance, but a famine will follow. During the fat years, Joseph tells him, make preparations to survive the lean years.

Republicans continue to hold 32 governorships, their highest level in a quarter century. Despite some recent losses in state legislatures, the GOP has held most of its 1994 gains. In Florida, Republicans now control both chambers in a Southern state for the first time since Reconstruction.
        <p><dd>
So just when power is starting to flow from Washington to the states, Republicans are waiting at the receiving end. Furthermore, GOP strength at the state level translates into a much deeper reserve of congressional candidates.
        <p><dd>
The GOP will probably do even better in 1998. In 33 of the past 34 midterm elections, the party holding the presidency has lost ground in the House. The historical pattern has been less consistent in the Senate, but Republican prospects look especially bright this time. They hold half of the 34 seats up in 1998, and only a couple of GOP incumbents face trouble. Meanwhile, Republicans could even beat several Democrats, especially extreme liberals such as Barbara Boxer of California. Early signs favor Republicans in state races as well.
        <p><dd>
The political community knows all about these trends, which makes the GOP's situation even cheerier. Access-hungry PACs will give heavily to Republicans. Many frustrated Democrats will retire, thereby opening a number of seats to strong Republican challenges.
        <p><dd>
Some optimistic conservatives have thus concluded that the GOP can expect a generation of political dominance. They should take another look at the 1996 returns, which offer clear signs of future trouble. In 1996, Republican House candidates got only 27 percent of the Latino vote nationwide. Previous elections yielded similar results, but the Latino electorate is growing in size and importance. Preliminary results suggest an increase in Latino turnout in 1996, at least in certain districts. The Clinton administration speeded up the naturalization of Latino resident aliens, and Democrats mounted a drive to get the new citizens to register and vote.
        <p><dd>
By 2025, says the Census Bureau, the number of Latinos will double from the current 27 million, accounting for 44 percent of the country's population growth. Not all will vote, but this dramatic demographic change will inevitably leave its mark at the polling booth. And if Democrats hold on to three-quarters of the Latino electorate, Republicans will have a growing problem.
        <p><dd>
Another trouble sign is regional. In the 1996 elections, the Northeast gave all of its electoral votes to Bill Clinton and accounted for two-thirds of the Democratic gains in the House. Among New England legislatures, Republicans control only New Hampshire, and they cling to the New York Senate only through gerrymandering. If Republicans begin to falter elsewhere, the Northeast will supply the Democrats with a firm base for revival.
        <p><dd>
In the 105th Congress, conservatives must begin a serious, long-term effort to counter such trends. They should take great care with their rhetoric: While adhering to a principled stand against illegal immigration, they must emphasize repeatedly that they are not criticizing Latinos who have arrived by lawful means. Through both legislative proposals and partisan communications, they must explain to Latinos how free-market policies benefit people who, like them, are climbing the economic ladder.
        <p><dd>
For the ecologically sensitive Northeast, conservatives need to develop the doctrine of free-market environmentalism. During the 104th Congress, Republicans stumbled when they attacked the EPA bureaucracy without explaining how they would replace command-and-control regulation with market incentives. Many voters concluded that Republicans were pro-pollution, not pro-reform. Now Republicans must show that cutting red tape does not mean befouling blue skies.
        <p><dd>
These efforts will require patience. Fortunately, conservatives have enough time, provided they remember what Joseph told Pharaoh.

<dd> Republican victories in the House and Senate would seem to indicate that the American people are moving in a conservative direction. Conservatives cannot assume, however, that a vote for Republicans is a mandate for their ideological agenda. They should remember that in exit polls during the 1994 elections, only 13 percent of voters surveyed said they had voted for Republicans. More than half had simply voted <I>against</I> Democrats. In truth, the election of 1994 was not a mandate for a Republican or conservative agenda, but an <I>opportunity</I> to develop a mandate. After that election, conservatives should have listened to the concerns of the American people. Instead, they became as insensitive to their constituents as the liberals they had replaced. It is clear, for instance, that the American people want smaller, more cost-effective government, but they didn't elect Congress to shut the government down.

<h3>Liberals defend their policies as "saving the children." This is the political equivalent of child abuse.<br>

<p>

<dd>Though conservatives are right in critiquing liberal policies, they must go beyond the role of opposition to offer a competing vision, communicated through powerful symbols. Time and again, liberals have defended a government-dominated agenda in the name of "saving the children." This is the political equivalent of child abuse. In fact, liberal policies have always focused on custodianship, usurping the roles of the family and community that provide a natural and sustainable system of support. They have, in effect, sentenced our nation's low-income children to a lifetime of dependency on government help. 
        <p><dd>
The conservative alternative cannot rely on ideological arguments about the excesses of government. We need a new vision to resurrect the family and the neighborhood as the primary support network for children -- as well as for adults in need. Such initiatives as the Community Renewal Act, parental choice in education, and charitable tax credits have been important steps in this direction.
        <p><dd>
Conservatives can learn a great deal from grassroots community leaders who embody conservative principles and values in their daily efforts to reclaim and revitalize their neighborhoods. One such example is Alverta Munlyn, a resident of a low-income neighborhood in Washington, D.C., where city services are notoriously inadequate. 
        <p><dd>

Although a city-run health center, which operates at a cost of $1.6 million a year, is just blocks away from Alverta's neighborhood, it has not met the medical needs of her community. Several elderly women have had their legs amputated because their diabetes went uncontrolled. One woman who was fearful that a lump in her breast might be cancerous was told that she would have to wait months to see a doctor. The clinic sometimes runs out of the insulin and syringes needed to treat diabetics and, at times, has been unable to deliver blood and urine samples to the city's medical lab because no drivers were available. The infant mortality rate, often considered a barometer of the health of a community, is four times the national average.
        <p><dd>

Alverta could not sit by as her neighborhood suffered. She developed a plan for alternative health care  --  a community-owned and operated clinic  --  and took steps to enact it. Networking with two private hospitals, Alverta secured the services of doctors as well as the use of their medical labs, X-ray facilities, and pharmacies. A site for a new clinic was chosen in an abandoned school building in the center of the neighborhood. Munlyn organized her neighbors, who raised $3 million, to prepare the building. The cost of operating this community health-care facility was projected to be one-third that of the existing clinic, saving the cash-strapped city $1 million a year.
<p><dd>
        With support from residents and city officials alike, Alverta's dream seemed close to being realized. But then it hit a roadblock: the unions of the city's service providers. A spokesperson for the 260 doctors who work for the city government warned that the clinic might interfere with plans to create a "public benefits corporation," and a labor leader from the union for city workers declared that such a clinic would result in a loss of jobs. Just two weeks after all players had signed on to this creative proposal to improve health care for the neighborhood, city officials changed their minds and blocked the health-care facility project.
<p><dd>
Conservatives need to make common cause with America's Alverta Munlyns. How much more powerful their arguments for the devolution of resources and authority will be when they stand side by side with grassroots leaders and declare, "Here are the principles and values we promote, embodied and implemented by a resident of a low-income community." They need to market themselves in a way that will illustrate that point and will help the community.
        <p><dd>

Conservatives tend to argue that private is better than public. But the issue is not public vs. private. It is effective vs. ineffective. The effectiveness often lessens as its size and its distance from the people it serves increases. Large private charities, large private hospitals, and educational institutions can be just as indifferent and insensitive as large government. Conservatives should be in the front line, pushing devolution from large institutions to individuals and community-based civic organizations. In return for the support they offer, they will enjoy greater moral authority, because the grassroots leaders with whom they partner are the embodiment of the principles for which they stand. 
When conservatives can stand shoulder to shoulder with grassroots leaders and design their programs in accord with a practical problem-solving neighborhood initiatives, then they will deserve popular support. Otherwise, they will not, and should not, get that support.

        In his new book, James Michener writes about the predictable course of civilizations. He cites eight states of existence: genesis, exploration, accomplishment, expansion, and then loss of courage, contraction, loss of mobility, and decline. This framework builds upon Will and Ariel Durant's warning in 1944 that "a great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within. The essential causes of Rome's decline lay in her people, her morals, her class struggle, her failing trade, her bureaucratic disposition, her stifling taxes, her consuming wars."
        
<p><dd>
America, this is our wakeup call. I believe Americans are listening, but are confused by what they see.
        
<p><dd>
In the last two elections, voters have shown their support for a conservative agenda: rolling back government, reasserting traditional values, ensuring economic opportunity for all, and lifting the heavy burden of bureaucracy and regulation from our entrepreneurs. They thought that both President Clinton and Republican members of Congress offered these conservative ideals.
        <p><dd>

President Clinton did, in fact, cherry-pick our ideas and principles and make them his own. Whether it's family values, law and order, lower taxes, a balanced budget or government accountability, voters in 1996 validated the so-called "extremist" agenda of the 104th Congress. The 105th Congress must seize this national momentum toward less government and more freedom.
        <p><dd>

I remain concerned, though, that we have yet to address the more difficult challenge outlined by Michener. We cannot reassert our principles at home without coming to grips with our global policies.
        <p><dd>

As we approach the 21st century, Bill Clinton has yet to set a foreign policy. The Clinton era has been marked by inordinate attention to far-flung places like Mogadishu, Somalia; Port au Prince, Haiti; and Sarajevo, Bosnia, while the future of our children depends on what happens in Tokyo, Bonn, London, Paris, Moscow, Mexico City, and Beijing.
        <p><dd>

Conservatives must help anchor our country's foreign policy to principles of stability, predictability, and a clear vision of what the world's lone superpower should do. Some conservatives see us in a defensive crouch  --  afraid to compete because we are doomed to lose. These conservatives favor trade protectionism, withdrawal from our overseas commitments, and isolationism.
        <p><dd>

I reject that vision. Our challenge is to establish a foreign and defense policy that is consistent with a bold, confident America not in retreat, as Michener warns, but standing tall astride the globe, expansive but not expansionist. Fundamental to such a policy is knowing when to put American lives at risk. Answering this question is the first step toward defining a coherent national security policy. Absent that, we lapse into an increasingly dangerous pattern: reinventing our national security policies, issue by issue, crisis by crisis.
        <p><dd>
We must develop a systematic policy for U.S. engagement, so that our actions in a crisis will be predictable for both our allies and our detractors. President Richard Nixon established that the United States would commit its military forces overseas:

<p><ul>
<li> To honor treaty commitments;
<p>
<li> To provide a nuclear umbrella to protect the world from weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, chemical, or biological);

<p>
<li> To supply weapons and technical assistance to other countries where warranted -- but not commit American forces to local conflicts; 

<p>
<li> To protect American citizens in a crisis.

</ul>
        <p><dd>
Together with former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger's doctrine of how to deploy force  --  overwhelmingly and confidently  --  these principles form a good foundation for a 21st-century security policy. Desert Shield and Desert Storm were based on these convictions. 
<p><dd>
        Yet President Bush's great victory stands in stark contrast to the way his successor has managed the civil war in Bosnia. Neither our allies nor our adversaries know what to expect of the United States. This vacuum of unpredictability pulled us into Bosnia. Our policy did not create the vacuum; the vacuum created the U.S. policy. We allowed others to set conditions for American leadership, and we ended up placing thousands of American troops in an area where we have no security interests. We must distinguish between a U.S. interest, which we do have in Bosnia, and a U.S. security interest, which we do not. Deployment of troops should hinge on the latter not the former.
<p><dd>

Integral to our conservative vision of engagement in the world must be a trade policy that is also continually advancing. NAFTA and GATT are good first steps, but there is more to be done. The future of our global leadership depends on free trade, and this administration's record is meager. We must strengthen the Western Hemispheric trade alliance and commit to an hemispheric free-trade agreement by the end of the century. Why not engage Japan and China with free and fair trade, instead of managing our trade relationships issue by issue, product by product? No engine of economic growth is more powerful than trade. It is waiting to be engaged. 
        <p><dd>

Finally, we have always helped victims of disaster  --  natural and man-made, and we should continue to do so. But we must distinguish between humanitarian efforts and national security interests, between our commitment to peace for others and our commitment to strength for our children's future.
        <p><dd>

America is obligated to continue to inspire democracy in other countries, as we have done for more than two centuries. We will accomplish this by promoting our virtues, expanding commerce through trade, and vigorously identifying and defending our vital interests, not by needlessly sacrificing our sons and daughters or draining our resources in ankle-biting civil wars.
        <p><dd>

This is our duty as Americans. And this must be our vision in Congress as we take the helm of America's journey into the new millennium.

        History will record the failure of the Democrats to win back control of either House of Congress as the story of the 1996 elections. Conservatives have successfully repelled the liberal counterattack following the 1994 elections, and on many fronts actually gained strength. Traditional Democratic liberalism is moribund.

<dd>Conservatives actually gained strength in many areas. In the U.S. Senate, conservatives gained seven seats, including Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Mike Enzi of Wyoming, and two from Kansas. In spite of the loss of 67 state legislative seats and control of some legislative houses, the party's gains of more than 600 state legislative seats in the last two years are essentially intact.
        <p><dd>
In the 90 or so referenda around the country, conservatives won, too. The California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI) leads the list, and tough tax limitations passed in half a dozen states while green initiatives failed. And it's no accident that the only two successful Democratic presidential candidates in the second half of the 20th century  --  Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton  --  were Southerners who campaigned as the most conservative of the candidates in the Democratic primaries, and then ran moderate-conservative presidential campaigns. President Clinton got elected in 1992 as the candidate of the middle-class income-tax cut who would "end welfare as we know it." In 1996, he wanted to balance the budget, fight crime, and end teenage drug abuse. 
<p><dd>
        So where to from here? Congress will likely begin by presenting the President with legislation that, at one time or another, he has supported. The middle-class tax cut is a prime candidate for prompt action. Fighting teenage drug abuse is another. In 1996, all the candidates talked about crime. It remains to be seen whether something can be done about it at the federal level without repeating the problems of the last crime bill. Continued, careful progress toward a balanced budget and regulatory reform are also good bets.
        <p><dd>
Liberals, frustrated with the political success of the "leave us alone" coalition, will probably eschew costly new governmental programs and embrace employer mandates and other indirect methods of satisfying their constituencies. Liberals will try to achieve their social objectives through employer mandates in the health-care arena as well as through the regulation of telecommunications and energy. Another danger is Jesse Jackson's suggestion at the Democrat National Convention that if only 5 percent of the $6 trillion in private pension funds could be tapped, social activists could reap a $300 billion windfall. Employers and employees, watch your pension funds!
        
<p><dd>
Besides conservative legislative successes, the elections of 1994 and 1996 will also encourage individual freedom, private solutions, and local responsibility to deal with our nation's challenges in the next two years. Already educational-choice initiatives and experiments are flourishing throughout the country. Educational-choice programs will continue until eventually, like the Berlin Wall, the government monopoly of our children's education will collapse into rubble  --  and with it the teachers unions.
        
<p><dd>
Nor is it any longer impossible to contemplate the first baby steps toward moving our nation's government retirement system slowly toward to a more private system. Over the next four years, these steps will comprise expansion of IRAs and 401(k)s and tax benefits for private systems. As this shift occurs, the next generation of Americans will realize that there is a better way to plan for their retirement than relying on the government. They will be its strongest supporters. 
<p><dd> 
A final prediction: Eventually the U.S. Postal Service will also be stripped of its monopoly and replaced by a more private system.
<p><dd>

        And what will be the legacy of the first Democratic president re-elected since Franklin Roosevelt? If he can avoid the perils of Whitewater, it seems a good bet that Clinton's finely honed political instincts will tell him which way the wind blows, and history will say, "Oh, he was there, too."

Conservatives should understand the following lessons from the 1996 elections: American voters (and the stock market) prefer divided government. For 30 of the past 50 years, at least one house of Congress has been controlled by a different party than that of the president, and this pattern will now continue for at least two more years. Most voters, I suggest, do not wholly trust either major party and prefer those policy outcomes that require a bipartisan agreement to those approved by a partisan majority.

<dd>The election strengthened the status quo distribution of political power. President Clinton was re-elected. The Republicans won a few seats in the Senate and lost a few seats in the House. There was no change in the number of state governors by party. The conservative-libertarian shift reflected in the 1994 election was neither repudiated nor strengthened; the voters are willing to give conservatives another chance but not an unlimited line of credit.
        <p><dd>
A final lesson is more a consequence of the passage of time than of the election: Almost all the old-guard Republican senators have now retired. The new Republican leaders in the Senate are younger, more conservative, and more like their counterparts in the House. This should make it easier to coordinate Republican policy positions and tactics between the House and the Senate.
        <p><dd>

Strategy for the 105th Congress should be based on a recognition <i>that the 104th Congress was unusually successful</i>. Congress approved several important reforms of congressional procedures that were part of the Contract With America and are likely to survive: subjecting Congress to laws that apply to other employers, limiting unfunded mandates, granting the president a line item veto, and establishing a process for reviewing and blocking major new regulations. The 104th Congress also approved the most important substantive legislation in 60 years affecting agriculture, telecommunications, and welfare. This record should prove that divided government is not a barrier to substantial reform. Conservatives made their major recent mistakes when they abandoned their principles to resolve some ephemeral crisis or to avoid controversy in the rush to adjourn.
<p><dd>

        My list of issues that the 105th Congress should address is too long to summarize briefly; those who are interested can read the new <i>Cato Handbook for Congress</i>. I do have a short list, however, of measures that conservatives should not initiate:
<p><dd>

<b>1. Do not initiate a Medicare reform proposal.</b> Clinton has fouled his own nest on this issue; let him sort this program out on his own without the cover of a bipartisan commission.
<p><dd>

<b>2. Do not press the social conservative agenda.</b> Most of these issues can and should be sorted out by state and local governments.
<p><dd>
        <b>3. Do not initiate new hearings on old scandals.</b> Let special counsel Kenneth Starr and the courts deal with these charges. The authority of Congress to hold hearings on the behavior of public officials is more valuable as a club in the closet. Try a cooperative strategy first; it might be productive, and you don't really want to deal with a President Gore.
<p><dd>

        The 1996 election set the stage for continued progress on the conservative agenda. I worry more about missed opportunities than setbacks. I doubt if Clinton will propose any major new domestic initiative; the danger of a misconceived foreign venture is much greater. The conservatives' biggest challenge is capturing the moral high ground from those who exhibit compassion by spending other people's money, from those who propose an expansion of government power in response to almost any perceived problem.

If conservatives are serious about reducing the cost and size of government, we must ask ourselves how government came to be so large and so expensive in the first place. The answer is that many conservatives were as happy as liberals to cede to government what had been the primary responsibility of individuals and charities.

<dd>Every study I've seen suggests that the premier problems in America are not economic and political, but moral and spiritual. Their solutions will not be found inside the Beltway, but inside the human heart. In fact, putting American families back together again would do more to solve social ills and reduce government's size and cost than any other proposal I've heard.
        <p><dd>So what's a conservative to do following a mixed-message election?

<p><dd> 
First, the congressional Republican majority must seize from Democrats the compassion issue, which has allowed them to denounce even reductions in spending increases as insensitive to grandmothers and little children. To do this, Republican leaders should call a summit meeting with the nation's religious leaders asking them to reclaim their former (even God-mandated) role of feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and visiting those in prison. The clergy should be given lists of those local families and individuals receiving public assistance and encouraged to begin the process of redemption in those lives. Marvin Olasky's <i>The Tragedy of American Compassion</i> could serve as a textbook for those who don't recall how religiously based societies fought poverty a century ago.
<p><dd>

        Nothing will kill liberalism and its costly programs quicker than a reduction in the perceived need for such programs. And nothing will rekindle compassion in people's hearts more quickly than a chance to help another person rebuild his or her life. Reducing the need for programs should at least parallel, if not precede, reducing the programs. Otherwise, Democrats will accuse Republicans of lacking compassion and reprise the battle over Medicare reform. When compassion is the issue, Democrats always win. But if the need for the welfare state is diminished, Republicans can cut programs and get credit for proper stewardship of the taxpayers' money.
        <p><dd>

Next, Republicans should continue to explain that the reason so many families earn two incomes is that one parent works to support the family while the other must pay the family tax bill. Bob Dole tried to sell that message during his campaign, but he was a poor salesman. The message, however, remains a good one -- if it is not seen as selfishness.
        <p><dd>

Freeing families from their huge tax burden would expand choices and opportunities and relieve some of the pressures that sometimes lead to divorce or neglect of the children. Such a policy could quickly close the "gender gap."
        <p><dd>
The 104th Congress suffered from nearsightedness. The Republican majority was so excited about the end of 40 years of wandering in the political wilderness that its exuberance overwhelmed sound judgment. Great social movements take time, but the GOP majority treated change like fast food when it should have found the time and ingredients necessary for a gourmet meal. Or, to use another metaphor, after four decades submerged under the welfare state, the conservative agenda rose too fast and suffered the political equivalent of the bends.
        <p><dd>
The biggest danger in a second Clinton term is the fate of the Supreme Court. Liberalism's worst excesses have come through the federal judiciary, not the legislative branch. The congressional majority should apply "strict scrutiny" to the records of Clinton nominees. A high rating from the American Bar Association is no reason for automatic confirmation, especially if the nominee's rulings favor Big Government at a time when voters want to reduce its size and cost.
        <p><dd>
Above all, Republicans must keep the public informed about what they are doing. Never again should they wait too long to respond to Democrat lies, distortions, and demagoguery. In addition to appearances on the regular news shows with their slanted questioners, Republicans should get their message out through year-round advertising on TV and in newspapers, pounding it home over the defenses of a hostile media, a disingenuous and sometimes lying Democratic leadership, and a shameless president.
        <p><dd>
Since the New Deal era, liberals have peddled a perverted form of the 23rd Psalm: The government is my keeper, I shall not want. Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of poverty, the Health and Human Services department is there, comforting me with food stamps and AFDC payments.
        <p><dd>

Republicans should counter this from the bottom up, highlighting success stories and role models and encouraging others to emulate good behavior. Congress might experiment with incentives in the form of tax credits or outright cash gifts to companies and individuals who succeed in relieving government of the burdens of maintaining a welfare state.
        <p><dd>

Congress cannot do any of this alone. The conservative movement should ask something of every American -- but without using the word "sacrifice." We are investing in our future and our children's future, not with more money, but with more of ourselves.

        Americans are deeply divided between two competing visions of government. One of them, clearly, is conservative -- limited government, deregulation, decentralization, lower taxes, and reduced government spending together forming a sometimes uneasy alliance with conservative positions on "social issues." The other vision is not easily characterized, partly because it is not yet fully formed. It is not liberalism -- liberalism cannot speak its name in American politics today. But neither is it liberalism-in-disguise, as many conservatives apparently believe. Elements of both the honest and the veiled liberalism survive, but their influence has diminished. The Democratic Party today not only wishes to be seen as having moved to the right; it <I>has</I> moved to the right. But that does not mean it has moved into anything like conservative territory.

<dd><b>The trouble behind.</b> The most conspicuous failure of the 104th Congress was its irresistible impulse to set its actions in a broader context. There is nothing wrong, and much right, about cutting taxes, cutting spending, deregulating. and so on. People like those things fine all by themselves. It is not necessary to try to persuade them that these changes are the Third Wave, or that they are consistent with libertarian philosophy, or that the streets should run red with the blood of counterrevolutionaries. Republicans had become so persuaded that they were speaking to Everyman's real concerns -- and they were, by the way -- that they imagined that they were doing so every time they opened their mouths. In this remarkably honest period in American politics, there was occasionally such a thing as too much candor. This is a case not for dishonesty, but for less matter and more art.
<p><dd>

<b>The trouble ahead.</b> It is impossible to know what legislation President Clinton might sign. Some have advocated waiting for him to make the first move on controversial issues like Medicare reform, so that Republicans won't take it on the chin in the realm of public opinion. This may work in some areas, but it lets Clinton pick the space he will work in.
<p><dd>

        Far better to let a hundred flowers bloom on the Republican side. Legislate, legislate, legislate. Keep sending him tax cuts until he finally likes one well enough to sign it, and then send him the rest anyway. There are, to be sure, certain practical obstacles, such as the senate filibuster wielded by Minority Leader Tom Daschle. But idle hands are the devil's workshop, so Republicans ought to busy themselves on Republican things.
<p><dd>

The danger for conservatives is that Bill Clinton and Al Gore may delineate and capture a political space somewhere to the right of the Left but to the left of the Right, and that this space contains enough votes to allow Democrats to rebuild a majority coalition. The new Democratic policy agenda is unlikely to contain anything like government-guaranteed health insurance, huge stimulus packages, or massive job-training programs. The more likely model for Democrats is the Family and Medical Leave Act -- a program that is mandate-laden but unbureaucratic, pitched to middle-class concerns, and much harder to attack than massive programs like ClintonCare.
        <p><dd>

The best way to avoid that trap, once again, is to keep Republicans at work on Republican things. If a united Democratic congressional caucus and White House reach across the aisle to Republicans more often than Republicans reach across to Democrats, then conservatism is in trouble.

        The electorate, sometimes a brutal tutor, has been kind to the Republicans. The lesson of the 1996 election is that the American people generally support the direction the party is traveling in, but are worried about the driving. Don't change direction, they are saying, your policies are sensible and necessary. But slow down and navigate more carefully. This republic is not the land of revolutionary jihads.

<dd>Three areas require attention: mindset, message, and messenger. Republicans must think and talk in the language, not of revolution, but of governmental reform and social renaissance. The past two years proved just how natural is the impulse among conservatives to oppose rather than propose. For decades, this tendency was well honed through the daily practice of confronting the totalitarian state abroad and the welfare state at home. The former is now functionally gone, the latter is at least ideologically spent. 
        <p><dd>

The challenge now is to create something new -- a humane and viable American society. The resuscitation of society is dramatically different work than the demolition of government. A society ravaged by cultural decay and social regression needs a politics of persuasion and prudence. Republicans must quickly evolve from political wrecking balls to architects of a prudently redesigned federal system and a revived civil society.
        <p><dd>

All this requires a different message. To use a football analogy, American politics is played between the 40-yard lines. The greatest gains for conservatism came in convincing the country that liberals had pulled America and the Democratic party too far to the left. These converts to conservatism were not looking to replace the ideological stridency of the Left with a rigid triumphalism of the Right. What they wanted was nonideological common sense, which is what conservatism has historically been about.
At stake is nothing less than a realignment that favors conservative ideas. America will be governed from neither the Left nor Right, but from the middle, albeit a middle dramatically redefined by conservatism. On a host of domestic policy issues -- welfare, crime, affirmative action, taxes, and decentralization -- today's center was yesterday's Right. Properly guided, these trends can be guided toward more important reforms, from downsizing government to voucherizing housing and health care to privatizing retirement programs. 
        <p><dd>

Finally, regarding the messenger, Republicans must think generationally. Half of Clinton's advantage was generational -- he embodied the <I>Zeitgeist</I> of the Baby Boomers, and to a lesser extent of Generation Xers. For the vast majority of the new electorate, the complexity and diversity of life obscures core certainties. The great temptation in an age of complexity is nostalgia. If the conceit of the Left is that it often ignores the past, the folly of some on the Right is thinking we can live in the past. 
<p><dd>

        The Republican party should skip a generation or two in its leadership to bring up talented women, minorities, and young people. To think that Republicans can govern for long on the Anglo vote alone is fantasy. The party must find a way to connect its principles to the aspirations of new generations and emerging constituencies. Hence the party would be unwise to nominate anyone over the age of 55 in the next presidential campaign. 
        <p><dd>

The greatest legislative priority of the new Congress must be entitlement reform. Republicans need to seize the historic moment to craft a bipartisan package to reform Medicare and Social Security. This is both a moral imperative and a political opportunity. There is a new antientitlement constituency forming, led by Generation X, which is deeply concerned about the crushing burden of debt it will carry. Entitlement politics are already beginning to shift as politicians are forced to pay greater attention to this emerging generation.
        <p><dd>

Republicans must also address the threat that judicial review poses to constitutional balance. Increasingly, the courts have arrogated to themselves the power to decide controversial moral and political questions. The result has been a serious erosion of self-government and of the credibility of the judiciary. To avoid a constitutional crisis, we will need to restore judicial restraint. This might well require congressional action to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts. Ultimately, the success of such efforts will depend upon increased conservative influence in America's culture-forming institutions, particularly the academy and the legal profession. 
        <p><dd>

Finally, we must recognize that many of our urgent national problems can't be solved through legislative fiat. Our efforts instead should be directed toward facilitating the efforts of citizens to solve problems at the local level. For example, Republicans need to develop and refine policies which encourage local involvement and private charity. The nation is on the verge of a historic turn-of-the-century civic and moral transformation, promising to curb teen pregnancy, renew fatherhood, recover character, and inspire faith-based charity.
        <p><dd>
Republicans have been in the classroom, cramming for two years of tests in parliamentary skills that the other party perfected over 50 years. Confounding the naysayers, it has received pretty decent grades and is now poised to excel.

        The election of 1996 demonstrated that when candidates articulate and believe in a conservative agenda, they generally win. When candidates take contradictory positions on major issues and convey with their every action that their positions are campaign props and not a reflection of their core beliefs, they generally lose. The American public clearly supports a conservative agenda of lower taxes, a balanced budget, and strong action against crime and drugs. The re-election of President Clinton is a testament to the essentially conservative message he adopted (tax cuts, balanced budget, welfare reform, school uniforms, et cetera), and to Bob Dole's implausible stand as a pro-growth presidential candidate.
<p><dd>

        In hindsight, it is clear that the crowning achievement of Republicans in the 104th Congress was the Contract With America. Their biggest mistake, however, was their failure to articulate a second Contract. Once the Contract votes were completed, congressional Republicans lost their momentum. And the GOP erred in selecting Medicare as the key issue of the 104th Congress. The Democrats were able to step into this vacuum with liberal issues such as health care and the minimum wage. Without a unified position, the Republicans were left looking defensive and divided.
        <p><dd>

Republicans must offer the public an agenda for the next two years. They would be wise to force President Clinton to offer a detailed Medicare rescue plan, but wait-and-see is not a sensible long-term strategy. The Republican agenda should include cutting taxes across the board, rolling back regulatory burdens that afflict small business and individuals, eliminating federal intrusion into education and the arts, combating drugs, and affirming the rights of parents.
        <p><dd>
As well, someone in Congress should step forward and defend the right of individuals to have fun. If adults enjoy smoking or drinking, let them. If we expect adults to sacrifice their lives on foreign soil and turn over half of their income to the government in taxes, they should at least be entitled to smoke if they so desire without fear of condemnation by the FDA or the president of the United States. Similarly, if someone likes to collect guns or hunt -- or even wear fur coats, let them. It is, after all, a free country. Politicians should stand up to the politically correct. Fun-loving Americans across the nation would applaud.

        Perhaps the most troubling aspect of the 1996 election is that half of the registered voters didn't bother to show up. The 1996 elections saw the lowest percentage of voter turnout since l924. That suggests that neither political party is connecting with the American public. Without recognizing it, both parties may already be on life-support systems. Most candidates refused to discuss the values-related issues that contributed to the large increase in turnout in 1994. Absent that, many voters saw little difference between the Republicans and the Democrats. Thus, when we hear about President Clinton's "mandate," it is helpful to keep in mind that only about 24 percent of the total eligible electorate voted him back into office.

<dd>Was Bob Dole's defeat inevitable as some of his supporters are now saying? The Zogby poll, the only one which was right on the money, suggested otherwise. A week before the election, Bill Clinton was attracting only 44 percent of the vote. Bob Dole was within striking distance. He simply didn't connect. Voters gave him every chance to tell them why he should be elected President instead of Bill Clinton. He never did so in a fashion that could be easily understood by the voters.
        <p><dd>

The election of 1996 is significant because it is the first time that Republicans have kept control of the Congress in back-to-back elections since 1928, and because Republicans held on to most of the ground they gained in state legislatures in the 1994 elections and subsequent defections by Democrats. It is extraordinary that Republicans lost only 67 state legislative seats nationwide (net), after gaining more than 600 seats from 1994 to 1996. Many of those losses were in New Hampshire's huge house of representatives, as well as in Vermont and Maine, so the actual number of chambers affected was relatively small. 
        <p><dd>

The election results of 1994 were not, as the media contended, a fluke, and not likely to be reversed soon. Indeed, 1998 will be the six-year-itch of the Clinton administration. Throughout U.S. history (except during the Civil War, every party that occupies the White House over an eight-year span suffers significant losses in the sixth year of that cycle. That means Republicans should be able to look forward to controlling the Congress at least until the year 2000. That fact alone will cause many older Democrats, who were used to power and who have been in limbo for the past two years, to throw in the towel in 1998. Republican opportunities will be legion, although the weakest Senate incumbents of both parties are up for re-election in 1998.
        <p><dd>

The 1996 elections have produced a more ideologically-polarized House and Senate. Newly-elected Republicans are more conservative than the retiring congressional incumbents they replace. Newly-elected Democrats are more liberal than their predecessors. As a result, fewer moderates remain in both chambers.
<p><dd>

        So now what comes next? So far, Republicans have behaved correctly since the election. It is time for Bill Clinton to take responsibility for governing the country. If he moves left, he will become again as unpopular as he was in his first term. If he moves right, he will enrage his base. Either way, Republicans would do well to make no moves until Clinton is forced to take a stand.
        <p><dd>

Organized labor is the big loser in the election. It spent a fortune (probably $300 million or more) to win back the Congress. It failed. The Religious Right saved the Republicans, but some in the GOP have already drawn the long knives to further disassociate the party from issues of concern to social conservatives. The Republican establishment risks precipitating a new party if they persist on alienating these conservatives.
        <p><dd>

Our military continues to suffer greatly under the Clinton regime. We have been blessed by not having any world threats we can't handle. It is amazing that we got through the first four years of Clinton without a major collapse. If Clinton stretches American forces any thinner, however, that collapse is nigh.
The most dangerous outcome of the 1996 election is that by the time he leaves office, Bill Clinton will have had the opportunity to appoint nearly 60 percent of the federal judiciary (if he lasts the whole term, and I believe he will not). He may get to appoint three more Supreme Court justices. If so, the Clinton legacy will linger for more than another generation. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott has warned Bill Clinton that he had better temper the sort of judges he is sending up for Senate confirmation. It will take only 41 of the 55 GOP Senators to block a confirmation.
        <p><dd>

And what of the Clinton scandals? Most Republicans are interpreting the elections as a message from voters to ease up on their investigations. I don't see it that way. Of course Republicans need to be careful how they go about their investigations, but I think it would be a dreadful mistake for the GOP to surrender this territory to Clinton.

<dd>Half the people who did vote chose to re-elect a moderate-sounding Bill Clinton because he is a man of the '90s and seems to understand us. But they retained a Republican House and Senate because the economy is doing pretty well and because President Clinton is a little loose with the truth and the national checkbook. 
<p><dd>
        The American people don't want their entitlements axed, but neither do they want to pay for loafers on welfare. They want regulatory barriers lifted, but not if it means relaxing environmental standards. 
<p><dd>
        Voters embraced a moderate to conservative campaign message. Gone were radical social policies and government-run health-care plans. Suddenly tax cuts were a good idea and the budget deficit could be reduced in less than 10 years. President Clinton was spouting lines like: "Families are the foundation of American life."
<p><dd>
        Voters heard a message they liked -- a conservative message of tax cuts, balanced budgets, welfare reform, tough crime policies, education choices, family values, and neighborhood and personal charity -- all items on the agenda of the 104th Congress.
<p><dd>
        So how did Bill Clinton replace his abysmal record with that of the 104th Congress? Conservative leaders in Congress failed to remind Americans in simple, compelling language, what they were doing and why they were doing it. They used the language of the head and forgot about the heart. Clinton co-opted the successes of the 104th Congress, got on his white horse, and took the high road to the White House, while his henchmen in Big Labor did the dirty work.
<p><dd>
        The lesson for the 105th Congress is that it was not the meat of the conservative message that troubled voters, but the presentation. The 105th Congress need not please everybody -- just the majority of voters who sent conservative lawmakers back to Congress and sent a conservative-sounding president back to the White House. 
<p><dd>
        Conservatives should call the president's bluff on his campaign promises. They should refuse to discuss compromises until Clinton offers the budget he discussed during the 1996 campaign. For example, the president said he would agree to balance the budget in seven years. This means the federal government will spend about a trillion fewer dollars between now and 2004. Conservatives should hold the president to his agreement. 
<p><dd>
        If the 105th Congress wants to take big or controversial actions, like wiping out a whole federal department, it must do so early and completely. If, instead, the budget for an agency slated for the scrap heap is merely cut, special interests will the opportunity to mobilize against those "mean conservatives." 
<p><dd>
        We can expect to see more of Bill Clinton's "triangulation" strategy -- steering a course between conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats. If Republicans do not have a clear game plan, Clinton will get 75 percent of what he wants and conservatives will get 25 percent. Both will declare victory. Conservatives need a sensible agenda with a compassionate public face.
<p><dd>
        The 105th Congress can expect labor unions and liberals to seek government-run health care. A unified front of special interests will try to block entitlement cuts and a Balanced Budget Amendment. The payoff for labor's campaign spending will be pension "reform" and federal protection from independent contractors. Stronger environmental regulations will be proposed. The National Education Association will insist that the federal government use the public-education system to provide health care and day care for all preschool children.
<p><dd>
        Liberals are opening a can of worms. But conservatives can use worms to bait their own hooks.

<dd>After seeing his grand health-care scheme go down in flames, while other initiatives such as the minimum-wage hike and the Kennedy-Kassebaum health-care reform sailed through the Congress, President Clinton and his allies will aim to expand government a little at a time. Instead of openly attempting to socialize health care or the workplace, for example, President Clinton will likely emerge during his second term as an "aggressive incrementalist." 
<p><dd>
        "Aggressive incrementalism" remains the president's most practical option to appease the Democrat Party's left wing. It is a crafty way to avoid the label of "Big Government liberal" while offering to ease the life of middle-class families. These initiatives -- mostly in the form of mandates on business -- will be sold individually as little ways that employers should help their workers. But as most businesses know, the weight of all these "little ways" add up to big costs. Of course, any new mandate on business, especially in the area of workplace issues, presents a new opportunity for employment lawyers to exploit these foggy areas of the law. President Clinton gets a "twofer" -- he pleases both Big Labor and the trial lawyers.
<p><dd>
        These incremental reforms include an expansion of the Family and Medical Leave Act; universal health insurance for children; a six-month health-care safety net for the "temporarily unemployed"; and a list of other health insurance requirements like mastectomies (following the recent law requiring 48-hour hospital stays for new mothers and mandating parity for mental-health coverage). And, of course, government agencies will move forward with their own aggressive rulemaking. From indoor-air quality to ergonomics and the like, Big Labor will be pushing government bureaucrats to micromanage our workplaces like never before.
<p><dd>
        President Clinton will likely move ahead with various executive orders to pay back key political supporters like labor and the environmental lobby. Chairman William Gould of the National Labor Relations Board will continue to act as a labor advocate rather than an impartial arbiter of labor law. For example, he will aggressively promote his "single-site organizing rule" to make it easier for unions to organize small businesses.
<p><dd>
        
The aggressive incrementalists can be stopped. With the passage of the Congressional Review Act and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, regulatory agencies have been curbed on paper, but Congress needs to make sure the agencies are complying with the new laws. Congress must show due diligence to ensure that regulators are not operating uncontrollably (as they now are). If it fulfills its oversight function aggressively, Congress has the tools to slow down the pace of regulation.
<p><dd>

        Now that everyone "agrees" that government is too big, conservatives have a great opportunity to further cut government spending. Corporate welfare is the perfect place to start, but Republicans and Democrats alike must join to wean their friends in business from the government dole.
<p><dd>

        Small businesses continue to support a big cut in the capital-gains tax. Cutting the tax in half is the best thing Congress and the president can do to spur growth. If an economic slowdown becomes the main issue of the 1998 mid-term elections, Clinton will deepen his party's losses in the House and Senate.  A cut in the capital-gains tax is his best insurance against the possibility that an economic downturn may threaten the health of both the economy and his party.

        The 1996 election was simply not a referendum on public policy. The Left learned in 1994 not to fight elections on the issues. President Clinton so obscured the policy differences between conservatives and liberals that the public did not perceive that any such differences existed. 
        <p><dd>
Unfortunately, most Republicans actually helped him in this regard; very few ran on the principles embodied in the party's Contract With America. Apparently intentionally, they failed to make the case that the Contract needed to be augmented and extended.
        <p><dd>
Exit polling suggests that those who voted for Clinton were not supporting any particular policy or even policy direction. Clinton voters voted primarily on personality issues and their perceived self-interest as members of a favored group. The old political bromides were correct on this point: In times of relative prosperity, voters seldom see a need to take any political risk or to tolerate significant change. Republicans failed to supply the incentive necessary to induce voters to inconvenience themselves. And, of course, Bill Clinton was the perfect candidate for a media-intense age marked by voter apathy. 
        <p><dd>
Clinton's core liberal constituencies hope that this lame-duck president will now have an unfettered opportunity to enact the liberal agenda. However, Republicans were granted legislative majorities to prevent this. Their task probably won't be difficult. For one thing, the press is much less likely to protect a president who faces no more elections and whose past behavior may very well yield Pulitzer Prize material to enterprising reporters. 
        <p><dd>
A much more perplexing problem for conservatives is how to achieve important public-policy goals such as the structural reform of Medicare, restraint of federal spending (including defunding the Left), tort reform, and the reduction or elimination of the federal role in education. These issues all involve tradeoffs between short-term political concerns and lasting results. Conservatives must figure out how to take their case directly to the people, emphasizing our courage and contrasting that with the shortsightedness of the president and his backers.
        <p><dd>
Conservatives need to explain to voters that we are not so much anti-government as ungovernment. For example, our vision of welfare reform is not improving the design of the program, but truly getting the government out of the business of inducing dependency. In education, we favor control by parents, not bureaucrats, and we believe that teachers and principals, not administrators, should set policy. We do not stop to calculate whether we can "pay for" tax cuts, but rather insist that we are reducing the ultimate government intrusion into personal economic affairs.
        <p><dd>

We also need to take our legislative victories wherever we find them and keep moving the policy debate to the right. Home runs are great, but they're not the only way to win. We should not fear to appear doctrinaire or radical when speaking the truth. We should always contrast ourselves with politicians and bureaucrats. Ours is a message of hope and optimism that can appeal to a public weary of business as usual.

<title>Speaker Gingrich Accepting the Speakership of the 105th Congress
</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<h3>Remarks by Speaker Gingrich</h3>
</center>

<blockquote><blockquote>

<P><br><p>


<P>Let me  say to those who voted for me, from
the bottom of my heart, thank you. To those who voted for someone else,
I hope that I can work with you in such a way that you feel that I am capable
of being speaker of the whole House and representing everyone. </P>

<P>To the freshmen and their families and all the young people who are
here today, you are part of a wonderful experience. Just as in less than
two weeks we will welcome the president for an inaugural, we here in the
legislative branch also celebrate a remarkable moment which the entire
world watches; a time when an entire nation voluntarily decides how to
govern itself and does so in such a manner that there is a sense among
the entire country that freedom is secure and that every citizen can participate.
</P>

<P>This is the 105th time we've done this as a country -- every two years.
The first one actually did not occur until April the 1st, 1789, because
while everyone was supposed to show up in March for the brand new Congress,
they couldn't find a quorum. And then they all came together. And there
are wonderful stories by people who were there written in their diaries
and their letters about the fact that they were just folks from all over,
of many different backgrounds. Back then they would all have been male
and they would all have been white and they would all have been property
holders. </P>

<P>Today we have extended democracy and freedom to levels that the Founding
Fathers could not have imagined. </P>

<P>And any citizen anywhere on the planet watching through C-SPAN and through
the networks and seeing this room and its diversity, can appreciate the
degree to which America opens its doors and its hearts to all people of
all backgrounds to have a better future. </P>

<P>In addition to the elected members, we are very fortunate to have a
professional staff on both sides of the aisle and a professional staff
serving on a nonpartisan basis. And let me say that I think that Robin
Carle stood well as the clerk of the House in representing all of us in
establishing with dignity. </P>

<P>And I thought that in the interchanges between she and Chairman Fazio
that the world could see legitimate partisanship engaged in legitimacy
-- legitimately, exactly the way it should be; in a professional, in a
courteous, in a firm way on both sides. And I think that's part of what
we have to teach the world. </P>

<P>In just a few moments, my dear friend John Dingell, who represents a
tradition in his district, who has fought all these years for all that
he believes in, who in the last Congress served so ably in helping pass
the Telecommunications bill, is going to swear me in. And I am going to
ask -- then I will have a chance to swear you in. But before that, if I
might, I'd say to my dear friend -- let me say my wife is here and my mother
and my relatives. </P>

<P>And two years ago, they were here with my father. He is not here today,
as I think all of you know. He was an infantryman. He served this country.
He believed in honor, duty, country. </P>

<P>Let me say to the entire House that two years ago, when I became the
first Republican speaker in 40 years, to the degree I was too brash, too
self-confident or too pushy, I apologize. To whatever degree, in any way
that I brought controversy or inappropriate attention to the House, I apologize.
</P>

<P>It is my intention to do everything I can to work with every member
of this Congress. And I would just say, as with telecommunication in Congressman
Dingell's case, on welfare reform, on line item veto, on telecommunications
reform, on steps towards a balanced budget, again and again we found a
bipartisan majority willing to pass significant legislation, willing to
work together. </P>

<P>There's much work to be done. I've asked Chairman Henry Hyde of the
Judiciary Committee to look at the issue of judicial activism. He has agreed
to hold hearings looking at that issue. </P>

<P>I think all of us should focus on increasing American jobs through world
sales. And I have asked Chairman Archer to look at the whole issue of taxation
and how it affects American job creation. </P>

<P>I've also asked the Ways and Means Committee to look at oversight on
NAFTA, on the World Trade Organization, because the fact is, we have to
move the legislative branch into the information age. If there are going
to be continuing bodies around the world, then Chairman Gilman in International
Relations and Chairman Archer and others have to get in the habit, I think,
of a kind of aggressive oversight, reporting to the nation on whether or
not our interests are being protected. </P>

<P>I've also asked Chairman Archer to prepare a series of hearings looking
at the entire issue of how we revise the entire tax code; whether we go
towards a flat tax or whether we replace the income tax with a sales tax,
or what we do; but to begin a process that, frankly, may take four to six
years, but is the right direction for the right reason. </P>

<P>Finally, I've asked Chairman Spence, on the National Security Committee,
both to look at the issue of national missile defense and to look at the
question of military reform. </P>

<P>And let me say to all of my friends on both sides of the aisle, we have
every opportunity through reform to shrink the Pentagon to a triangle;
we have every opportunity to apply the lessons of downsizing, the lessons
of the information age. And just because something is in uniform doesn't
mean it has to be saluted, but instead, we should be getting every penny
for our taxpayers, and we in the Congress should be looking at long-term
contracting as one way to dramatically lower the cost of defense. </P>

<P>But I want to talk about one other area. And here I just want to say
there's something more than legislation. Each of us is a leader back home.
And I want to just talk very briefly about three topics, and it's about
these children and their America, children on both sides of the aisle,
children from all backgrounds in every state. </P>

<P>I think we have to ask the question, as leaders, beyond legislation:
How do we continue to create one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty
and justice for all? I believe most Americans, whether native-born or immigrant,
still desire for us to be one nation. So let me briefly talk about three
areas that I think are vital. </P>

<P>Let me say first, I think -- I'm going to talk just for a second about
race, drugs and ignorance. First, let me ask all you: Do we not need to
rethink our whole approach to race? And let me draw the parallel to Dick
Fosbury. He was a high jumper. In the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, he
developed an entire new approach which is now used by everyone. Yet for
six years, the U.S. Olympic Committee rejected it. </P>

<P>My point is very simple. I don't believe any rational American can be
comfortable with where we are on the issue of race. And I think all of
us ought to take on the challenge as leaders, beyond legislation, beyond
our normal jobs, of asking some new questions in some new ways. After all,
what does race mean when if based on merit alone, ethnic Asians would make
up a clear majority at the University of California at Berkeley? What does
race mean when colleges recruit minorities in the name of inclusiveness
and diversity and then segregate them in their own dormitories? What does
race mean when many Americans cannot fill out their census forms because
they're an amalgam of races? And furthermore, if those of us who are conservative
say that bureaucracy and compulsion is not the answer, then what are we
going to say to a child born in a poor neighborhood with a broken home
and no one to help them rise, who has no organic contact to prosperity
and has no organic contact to a better future? </P>

<P>Now, I mentioned this in passing two years ago, and one of the failures
that I would take some of the responsibility for is that we did not follow
up. But I want to put it right on the table today that every one of us,
as a leader, has an obligation to reach out beyond party and beyond ideology
and, as Americans, to say, ``One of the highest values we're going to spend
the next two years on is openly dealing with the challenge of meaning that
when we say in our declaration that we are endowed by our Creator with
certain unalienable rights, including life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness, that every child in every neighborhood, of every background,
is endowed by God. </P>

<P>And every time America fails to meet that, we are failing to meet God's
test for the country we should be.'' </P>

<P>Let me say second about drugs; I think we have to redefine and rethink
our approach to drugs. One of my close friends had her 19-year-old sister
overdose, and her 19-year-old sister today is in a coma and celebrated
her 20th birthday in that coma. Drugs aren't statistics. As Charlie Rangel
told me at breakfast just two years ago, drugs are real human beings being
destroyed. Drugs are real violence. If we did not have drugs in this country,
the amount of spouse abuse, the amount of child abuse, the amount of violence
would drop dramatically. And so I want to suggest that we should take seriously
reaching across all barriers and establishing an all-out effort. </P>

<P>You know, the Columbia University Center for Addiction and Substance
Abuse has done a fascinating study. The center found that one of the best
predictors of whether a child will stay free of drugs is whether he or
she practices a religion. Joe Califano, Lyndon Johnson's former adviser
and Jimmy Carter's secretary of Health and Human Services, says that religion
is part of the solution to our drug problems and to drug treatment itself.
Alcoholics Anonymous refers to a ``higher power.'' I don't know what all
the answers are. But I do know that if we love these children, in addition
to fighting racism and reaching out to every child, we need to decide that
we are prepared to have the equivalent of an abolitionist movement against
drugs and to do what it takes so that none of these children end up in
a coma celebrating their birthday or end up dead. </P>

<P>Lastly, we need to pay closer attention to a word you don't hear much
anymore: ignorance. Traditionally, ignorance ranked with pestilence, hunger,
war as abominations upon humanity. But in recent years, the word ignorance
has been cleaned up and refined into some aspect of educational failure.
I mean by ignorance something deeper. It's not about geography in the third
grade. It's about learning the work ethic. It's about learning to be a
citizen. It's about learning to save. It's about all the things that make
us functional. It's about the things that allow virtually everybody in
this room to get up each morning and have a good life. </P>

<P>There are too many place in America where people are born into dysfunction,
educated into dysfunction and live in dysfunction, and we should find a
way to reach out in this modern era and use every tool at our tips, from
computers to television to radio to personal volunteerism, so that every
family that today happens to be dysfunctional has a chance within the next
few years to learn to be functional. </P>

<P>And I think we should take ignorance as as serious a problem as drugs
or race. </P>

<P>We in the Congress have one place; we have an obligation beyond any
other, and that's this city. And I want to commend Eleanor Holmes-Norton
for the leadership she has shown and the courage she has shown day after
day and week after week. She and Tom Davis and Jim Walsh worked their hearts
out over the last two years, and I believe it is fair to say that in some
ways, we have begun to make progress. It is not easy. It has to be done
carefully. It cannot violate the right of the citizens of this city. But
let's be candid, first, this is our national capital. We have a unique
obligation on both sides of the aisle, to care about Washington, because
we are today to Washington what a state government would be back home to
your town. We have an unusual obligation to Washington. </P>

<P>Second, it is our national capital. And people looked at me as though
I'd lost my mind a year and a half ago when I met with Mayor Barry and
I said, ``You know, our vision ought to be the finest capital city in the
world.'' And that ought to be our vision. </P>

<P>And furthermore, if we're going to talk honestly about race and we're
going to talk honestly about drugs and we're going to talk honestly about
ignorance, we owe it to every citizen of this District, every child in
this District, to have a decent chance to grow up and go to a school that
succeeds, in a neighborhood that is drug-free and safe, with an expectation
of getting a job in a community that actually cares about them and provides
a better future. And we should take on as a capital -- as a Congress, our
responsibilities to the District of Columbia, and we should do it proudly.
And we should not be ashamed to go back home and say, ``You're darn right
we're helping our national capital because we want you to visit it with
pride, and we want you to know that you can say to anyone anywhere in the
world: Come to America and visit Washington, it is a great city.'' </P>

<P>Let me close with this final thought -- and I appreciate my friend,
John, standing there. And I apologize for having drawn you forward, particularly
since you're standing on one foot. </P>

<P>But this has been a very difficult time. And to those who agonized and
ended up voting for me, I thank you. Some of this difficulty, frankly,
I brought on myself. We will deal with that in more detail later. And I
apologize to the House and the country for having done so. Some of it is
part of the natural process of partisan competition. </P>

<P>This morning, a very dear friend of mine said that he was going to pray
to God that I would win today, and I asked him not to. I asked him to pray
to God that whatever happens is what God wants, and then we would try to
understand it and learn from it. </P>

<P>Let me put that forward in the same thing for all of us as we approach
the next two years. I was really struck about a month ago when I walked
down to the Lincoln Memorial and I read the Second Inaugural, which is
short enough to be on the wall. And 12 times in that inaugural, Lincoln
refers to God. I went back and read Washington's first inaugural, which
is replete with reference to America existing within God's framework. I
read Jefferson's first inaugural -- since he's often described as a Deist
-- which refers to the importance and the power of Providence. All of you
can visit the Jefferson Memorial where he says -- around the top it is
inscribed --''I have sworn upon the altar of God Almighty eternal hostility
against all forms of tyranny over the minds of men.'' </P>

<P>We have much to be proud of as Americans. </P>

<P>This is a great and a wonderful system. We have much to be ashamed of
as Americans; from drug addition to spouse and child abuse, to children
living in ignorance and poverty surrounded by the greatest, wealthiest
nation in the world; to a political system that clearly has to be overhauled
from the ground up if it is going to be worthy of the respect we want and
cherish. </P>

<P>I would just suggest to all of you that until we learn in a nonsectarian
way -- not Baptist, not Catholic, not Jewish -- in a nonsectarian way --
until we learn to reestablish the authority that we are endowed by our
Creator, that we owe it to our Creator, and that we need to seek divine
guidance in what we are doing, we are not going to solve this country's
problems. In that spirit, with your prayers and help, I will seek to be
worthy of being speaker of the House, and I will seek to work with every
member sent by their constituents to represent them in the United States
Congress. </P>

<h2>Setting an Example</h2> 
<i>Jan. 3, 1997</i>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<p>

I usually refrain from commenting on people before they have been formally charged, but the recent news regarding Michael Irvin has me thinking -- Is there anyone in the public eye left that our children can look up too. 
<P>
It seems that wherever we look, another athlete or movie star has had another run-in with the law. Whether it is Irvin's cocaine problem and the latest rape incident, or the late Snoop Doggy-Dog with his gangster lifestyle, our children are witnessing the demoralization of America first hand.  Each time one of their favorite stars fall, a child must lose a bit of faith in humanity. It must be an incredibly confusing experience for a young child to see the man, who's image is plastered all over their bedroom walls, taken away in handcuffs.
<P>
Even I, as an adult, was affected a few years back, when I heard that Magic Johnson was living a lifestyle that exposed him to HIV.  Events such as these affect more than just the participants - they seem to cheapen our society piece by piece.  It has gotten so bad that most parents wouldn't want their children to grow up to be President.  For our society to be at the point where the office of the Presidency isn't highly respected is a sad commentary on our country.  
<P>
NBA player Charles Barkley, who often gets into trouble on the basketball court, likes to say that he doesn't have to be a role model.  Baloney.  Being a role model is not something one chooses, but being a good role model is.  As long as we inhabit this earth, children will look up to and emulate those they see on television.  Athletes and other celebrities must just accept this responsibility along with the millions that get paid by the parents of these children.
<P>
Some athletes have accepted this responsibility.  Jim Harbaugh, quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts, always starts every interview following a victory with the words "I want to thank my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ."  This is something that my children should be respecting - a man who has succeeded in sports and still understands his priorities.  The opposite, once again is exemplified by our favorite good Samaritan, Michael Irvin.  After winning the Super Bowl, he was on national television swearing and using the f-word with frequency.   I was completely embarrassed to be watching such a disregard for common courtesy.
<P>
Parents already have a difficult task in raising their  children.  They don't need to compete with Michael Irvine and his flamboyant lifestyle. The sad thing is that Irvin and the Cowboys might just win it all again this year.  Wouldn't that be a great lesson to teach our children?


<p>
God bless you in your efforts,<p>

<b><h2><CENTER>PHILLIPS FOUNDATION SEEKS APPLICANTS FOR JOURNALISM FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM</h2>
<h3>Working Journalists Eligible for $50,000</h3><br>
<hr size=3 width=50%></center><p>
</CENTER>
<blockquote>
Potomac, MD, November 12, 1996</b> -- The Phillips Foundation today announced that it is now accepting applications for the 1997 Phillips Foundation Journalism Fellowship Program.  Working journalists with less than five years of professional experience in print journalism are eligible to apply.  The Phillips Foundation offers one full-time $50,000 fellowship and two part-time $25,000 fellowships to undertake and complete a one-year project of the applicant's 
choosing focusing on journalism supportive of American culture and a free society.
<p>
The Phillips Foundation is a non-profit organization founded in 1990 to advance the cause of objective journalism in several ways, including this annual journalism fellowship.  The Foundation established this program to provide grants for projects to be undertaken by working print journalists who share the Foundation's mission to advance constitutional principles, a democratic society and a vibrant free enterprise system.  The Foundation awarded two fellowships in 1996:  a full-time fellowship to Stacy Mattingly for her proposal to write a book on a highly-charged school prayer case in northern Mississippi; and a part-time fellowship to Daniel Richardson to write a series of articles on the growing Patriot movement in America.
<p>
The three Trustees of the Phillips Foundation serve as judges for this annual competition.  The Trustees include:  Thomas L. Phillips, President and Chief Executive Officer of Phillips Publishing International, Inc.; Robert D. Novak, prominent national journalist and author of one of the longest running syndicated columns in the country; and Alfred S. Regnery, a Washington attorney and President of Regnery Publishing, Inc., a Washington, D.C.-based book publishing firm.
<p>
The Foundation is looking for journalism projects which are both original and publishable.  The winning projects will be delivered in four installments with the potential to be published sequentially in a periodical or all together as a book.<p>

Applications are now being accepted for the 1997 Phillips Foundation Journalism Fellowship.  Applications must be postmarked by March 1, 1997. The winner will be announced on May 6, 1997 at an awards dinner in Washington, D.C.  The starting date for the fellowship will be September 1, 1997.  Applicants must be citizens of the United States.
<p>
For an application, contact:  The Phillips Foundation, 7811 Montrose Road
Potomac, MD  20854, Attention: John Farley.  Phone:  301-340-2100.

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva"><B>Freedom.</B> That's the important conclusion of the <i>1997 Index of Economic Freedom</i>, published jointly by <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>, the prominent Washington, D.C., think tank, and <a href="http://wsj.com"><i>The Wall Street Journal</i></a>, the international financial daily.
<p>
The <i>Index</i> proves that the path to prosperity has the same starting point worldwide: economic freedom. The higher a country <A HREF="/heritage/index/rankings.html">ranks</A> on the <i>1997 Index of Economic Freedom</i>, the faster it is likely to grow, improving the living standards of its people. The more a government interferes in the free market, the slower the economy and the poorer the citizens.
<p>
In addition to lively essays by Heritage analysts and editors from the <i>Wall Street Journal's</i> Editorial Page, the Index provides country-by-country analyses of the world's economies. With up-to-date data on 150 countries, it's a practical, readable reference on tax rates, tariffs, banking, foreign investment codes, regulations, and more. 
<p>
The  <i>1997 Index of Economic Freedom</i> is an indispensable handbook for anyone who invests or does business abroad. And it's an essential guide to growth for those who want to understand why some countries prosper and others lag behind.

<b>This was originally posted to the Town Hall Forum (#3474)</b>
<P>

    TO: MY DEMOCRAT FRIENDS <P>
    FROM: MARK F. (THOR) HEARNE, II<P>
    DATE: OCTOBER 11, 1996<P>
    RE: THE CASE FOR CHARACTER<P>
<P>
<blockquote>
"Bill Clinton would rather climb a tree to tell a lie than stand on the ground to tell the truth." So said an Arkansas official familiar with Clinton on CNN during the 1992 presidential campaign. Democratic Senator Bob Kerry has said, "Clinton is an unusually good liar. Unusually good. Do you realize that?" Senator Kerry did not make this observation during the heat of a primary battle but this past January in Esquire Magazine. Kerry is not only a Democratic Senator, but is also a leader of his party and Chairman of the Democrat Senatorial Campaign Committee. Senator Kerry knows whereof he speaks. 
<P>
Forget what this says about Clinton - what does it say about us. We are told that Clinton is leading by a significant margin in his campaign to be our next president. (51% to Dole's 38% according to last week's Wall Street Journal/ABC poll.) We are told that "character" does not count. We are told that a candidate's "personal life" has no relevance to the office of President and has no "traction" as a political issue. Indeed, we are even made to feel ashamed for raising the issue. (On July 15th Clinton said, "I think character is a legitimate issue and I look forward to having that discussion." But, whenever the issue of character is mentioned Clinton dodges the discussion by claiming any question about his character is a viscous, Republican-motivated "personal attack.") 
<P>
    Consider the current best seller list. A list which includes an astounding number of books about the
    corruption of the Clinton administration. Boy Clinton, Unlimited Access and Blood Sport are
    only a few. But let's concede Clinton the benefit of his denials and explanations. Taking only those facts Clinton has acknowledged, and even
    granting him his spin on these facts, Clinton is far and away the most dishonest president or presidential candidate in the history of our nation. 
<P>
    Let us assume that only 10% of what is reported about Bill Clinton is true. Assume that only 10% of the reports of drug use, rampant promiscuity, financial fraud,  and blatant violations of state and federal law are accurate. Assume only 10% of the Wall Street Journal's four year, two volume documentation of Whitewater, Travelgate and FBI Filegate is not innuendo and conjecture. Assume that Clinton's unlikely explanation of Whitewater is correct. (It wasn't a crooked deal to funnel taxpayer guaranteed funds from a Savings and Loan into his political campaign. Rather, we are told, Bill and Hillary, naive in matters of money -- notwithstanding Hillary's wildly successful commodities speculation -- were duped by the crafty McDougalls into a foolish real estate investment scheme funded by kited checks and illegal loans. Frankly, even if valid, I fail to find any comfort in this explanation. Do we want a sharp crook or a financially unsophisticated waif in charge of our national economy?) 
<P>
    Granted even these assumptions, impeachment should be likely, reelection unthinkable. Consider the following: 
<P>
        Richard Nixon's administration collapsed, Nixon resigned the presidency and Chuck Colson
        was jailed over misuse of only one FBI file and the related cover-up. By contrast, Clinton and
        Craig Livingstone spirited away the FBI files of their political opponents by the hundreds,  and the
        cover-up and stone-walling continues. 
<P>
        Spiro Agnew resigned the Vice-Presidency over charges of tax evasion stemming from
        $16,000 he accepted from contractors when he was Governor of Maryland. By contrast,
        Clinton has conceded that he filed misleading tax returns that did not properly disclose illegal
        loans made by a now-defunct S&L,  the proceeds of which were used in his campaign for
        Governor. The reason he was not charged with tax evasion was that he released the tax returns
        after the statute of limitations had expired. Equally well established is the fact that Hillary
        enjoyed more than $100,000 in "profits" from commodities trading orchestrated
        by Tyson Foods in exchange for favorable treatment accorded Tyson Foods by her husband, 
        then the Governor. 
<P>
        Gary Hart bowed out of the 1988 presidential race because of one wild weekend in the
        Bahamas and a sleep-over in Washington DC. By contrast, Clinton is being sued in federal
        court for enticing a young woman - against her wishes -- into his hotel room, dropping his
        trousers and suggesting she engage in a lurid sex act. Clinton's known sex-partners could form
        a single-file line longer than the inaugural parade route. (At least JFK was honest about his
        philandering. During a 1961 meeting in Bermuda with British Prime Minister Harold McMillian
        Kennedy said, "I wonder how it is with you, Harold? If I don't have a woman for three days, I get terrible headaches.") 
<P>
        Ginsburg is not a member of the US Supreme Court because he used marijuana during
        college. By contrast, during Clinton's term national drug use has doubled due to Clinton's
        eviscerating drug enforcement. Remember also Jocelyn Elders, Clinton's selection for Surgeon
        General. In addition to her crusade to distribute condoms (for which she earned the moniker
        "the Rubber Maid") and to have mast. taught in public schools, she campaigned for the
        legalization of drugs. During her term as Clinton's Surgeon General, Elders son was convicted
        of felony cocaine and crack distribution. (If she couldn't keep her own son from pushing
        crack, how could she be expected to reduce national drug use?) It is simply beyond belief
        that, with someone of Elder's views as his pick for the nation's chief medical officer, Clinton
        expects us to believe he truly wants to battle illegal drugs. 
<P>
        On a personal level Clinton acknowledges that he used marijuana but claims he "didn't inhale".
        Yet in an MTV interview with high school students Clinton states that if he had it do over again
        he, "probably should have inhaled." Roger Clinton described his brother's appetite for cocaine
        by stating, "He (Bill Clinton) has a nose like a Hoover." (Referring to the vacuum cleaner not
        the president who preceded Roosevelt.) But, we can discount this allegation because Roger
        Clinton, along with Friend Of Bill Dan Lasater, have been convicted of felony drug charges for
        the distribution of cocaine. 
<P>
    (As an entry for the "How'd They Do That" file consider this: Roger Clinton served only two years
    for his cocaine distribution charges and Dan Lasater served only six months. Roger cut a deal with
    the prosecutor to testify against Lasater. Lasater was convicted but pardoned by Governor Clinton.
    (Clinton says the pardon was so Lasater could qualify for a hunting license.) However, even as
    Lasater was being investigated for drug dealing Clinton's Arkansas Finance Authority awarded
    Lasater authority to underwrite a $30 million bond issue. An undertaking for which Lasater pocketed
    $750,000. The purpose of this bond issue for which the state of Arkansas awarded $750,000 to a
    drug dealer? An Arkansas state police communication facility. Clinton's pardon of Lasater raises an
    interesting point. Why won't Clinton promise to not pardon Susan McDougal (who is currently in jail
    because she refuses to testify about Clnton's role in the Whitewater scandal) and other Whitewater
    defendants? Clinton has already indicated a willingness to put the power of a presidential pardon to a
    personal purpose. Clinton has pardoned Jack Pakis a Hot Springs, Arkansas bookie and close friend
    of the Clinton family. 
<P>
    Given this, why is Clinton the favored candidate for president? Have our standards for the office of
    president fallen this far this fast? What does it say about us and our esteem for our nation that we
    would trust Bill Clinton with the United State of America. 
<P>
    A question should be asked of each vice-presidential candidate in the upcoming debate. "Would you
    want your daughter to marry a man with the personal character of your running mate?" Recall the
    question to Mike Dukakis about how he would view the death penalty if his wife Kitty was raped.
    Well, why not a similar question to Hillary. How would she feel if Chelsea brought home a boyfriend
    with the same character and integrity as Bill Clinton? (Some may be upset with me for bringing Hillary
    into the discussion. After all, they may retort, she is not running for office. Would it have been fair
    they ask to deny Lincoln the presidency because Mary Todd was a lunatic? To which I reply, Yes, if
    Lincoln had threatened to put Mary Todd in charge of the Union Army as Clinton tried to do with
    Hillary and health care.) 
<P>
    Two responses, and only two responses, are possible. One, all the charges against Clinton are false
    and Clinton is, in truth, a noble and honest - though much maligned - man. (This is the official White
    House position.) Two, the charges are, in whole or part, true but it just doesn't matter. Clinton's
    character is irrelevant to his fitness to serve as president. 
<P>
    If you opt for option number one, "Clinton is a wrongly- maligned honest man", than you probably
    also thought O.J. Simpson was framed. Haley Barber's line, "Clinton may not believe anything, but his
    friends have convictions - for bank fraud, embezzlement, conspiracy..." resonates because it is true. 
<P>
    Two-thirds of the Rose law firm, the source of Clinton's closest colleagues including his wife, are either dead under suspicious circumstances (Vince Foster), in jail after serving in the Clinton
    administration (Webster Hubble) or under indictment or investigation by a special prosecutor
    (William Kennedy). A similar fate has befallen many of Clinton's other top advisors. Housing
    Secretary Henry Cisneros and Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy are currently subject to an independent counsel
    investigation; former Commerce Secretary Ron Brown was a subject of an independent counsel
    investigation prior to his death; Clinton understudy and friend Arkansas Governor Guy Tucker and
    Clinton business partners Jim and Susan McDougal have been jailed for 24 count conviction for bank fraud and
    conspiracy. Clinton testified on behalf of the McDougals and Governor Tucker. After the trial, jurors
    told reporters that they did not believe Clinton's testimony and several jurors stated that, based upon
    the evidence they considered, Clinton was definitely involved in the wrongdoing. 
<P>
    It is simply not possible to consider the incredible number of Friends Of Bill who are under
    indictment, under investigation by independent counsel, in jail or awaiting sentencing and conclude
    that all the charges against Clinton are false. 
<P>
    Clinton apologists reply that it is unfair to paint Clinton with the same brush as his jailed colleagues.
    Democrat Senator Chris Dodd claims that to view Clinton in light of his friends is to engage in "guilt
    by association". These defenders argue that Clinton has just suffered the misfortune of being
    surrounded by dishonest people and is not, himself, dishonest. This explanation, even if credible, is of
    little comfort. Do we want as president a man so lacking in judgment that he has a profoundly
    uncanny ability to choose as his closest advisors a collection of crooks and felons. 
<P>
    Bluntly put, Bill Clinton is an unmitigated, dissembling liar. What Clinton says is meant to deceive not
    to inform. During an interview on September 23rd with PBS's Jim Lehrer Clinton said, "There is not
    a single solitary shred of evidence of anything dishonest that I have done in my public life." Most of us
    hearing this proclamation would understand it to be a blanket denial of any wrongdoing. Clinton
    clearly intended to communicate this understanding. However, reread Clinton's statement. "There is
    not a single solitary shred of evidence...." Clinton does not deny dishonestly, rather he denies that
    there is any evidence of his dishonesty. Quite a different proposition. Continuing with a further
    qualification Clinton said, "...that I have done in my public life." The injection of "public life" presumes
    a distinction with Clinton's private life. Given the mountainous evidence of Clinton's dishonestly, we
    can only conclude that Clinton believes using drugs, funding his Arkansas gubernatorial campaigns,
    funding his presidential campaign, managing the White House travel office and FBI files and
    formulating national policy are all part of his private life. 
<P>
    Option Two, "Clinton is dishonest but character doesn't count when choosing the President", is
    equally untenable. Consider the purpose of the election. For starters, this November we will decide
    who will take the constitutionally prescribed oath next January. A candidate for president does not
    become president by winning the election. The candidate must also take the oath of office and does
    not become president until he does so. (Recall the photograph of Lyndon Johnson taking the oath of
    office in Air Force One on the tarmac in Dallas standing next to a blood- splattered Jackie
    Kennedy.) 
<P>
    We do not make much of oaths now days. Yet, the men who crafted our form of government,
    founded our nation and authored the Constitution placed great significance on oaths and,
    correspondingly, the integrity of the individual taking the oath. A man's honesty and integrity were
    vitally important to our founding fathers. Thomas Jefferson, founder of the Democrat party, wrote,
    "We mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor." Of what value is
    Bill Clinton's "sacred honor" and to what cause would he pledge it? (Obviously not his wife, nor his
    country when called to military service.) More importantly, would you believe him if he did? 
<P>
    This is a more troubling question for my principled liberal friends. (Especially for those who make so
    much of Republican scandals whether it be Watergate, Iran- Contra or the Teapot Dome.) The most
    outrageous Republican is a piker compared to the mythomaniacs, miscreants and poltroons which
    populate the Clinton administration. (Will someone please tell me George Stephanopoulos's job
    description and how whatever it is he does furthers the legitimate business of the presidency.) 
<P>
    Those Democrats who support Clinton (and their allies in the media who overlook the Clinton
    scandals) have lost the right to ever again mention Watergate, Iran-Contra or any other allegation of
    Republican corruption. 
<P>
    Most liberals acknowledge Clinton's fundamental dishonesty. However, they appear willing to
    tolerate or overlook his moral failings because they believe Clinton will advance a liberal ideology and
    Bob Dole will oppose the liberal's agenda. But, in choosing Clinton as their standard bearer, what are
    liberals saying about their own integrity and the validity of their ideology? 
<P>
    How can the noble ideals proffered by the liberal be reconciled with the tawdry and untrustworthy
    reputation of their candidate? What does is say about the validity of liberalism that the adherents
    chosen advocate is a consummate fraud? In choosing Clinton as their candidate (a candidate who
    liberals support because they believe he will govern with a liberal bent even though he publicly
    campaigns as a conservative) aren't liberals saying that their agenda is best advanced by disguising
    and concealing their ideology and, by implication, recognizing that if American voters truly
    appreciated the liberal agenda they will reject the ideology? 
<P>
    If I believed I had a worthy policy to advance I would not choose an unworthy spokesman to
    advance the policy lest the message be sullied by the messenger. If I was trying to sell a drug to cure
    cancer I wouldn't choose Jack Kevorkian to be my spokesman. 
<P>
    Indeed, Clinton's failure to keep the faith even with political bed-mates is why two high-ranking
    administration officials resigned when Clinton signed the Republican welfare reform bill that
    he had previously promised to veto. Abandoning Clinton is the only rational response available
    to honest liberals who truly believe in the merits of their ideology. 
<P>
        Others don't defend Clinton but disparage us.  They argue:
<P>
    "So what if Clinton lies, uses drugs and cheats on his spouse, most American's behave this way and it
    is hypocritical to hold a leader to a standard higher than the standard by which we measure our own
    behavior." 
<P>
    While I don't agree that Clinton's behavior is characteristic of the typical American, I will grant this
    point for the sake of argument. Granted even that assertion, I dispute the central premise. Americans
    aspire to greatness and have always been an optimistic people. Our leaders should be the best from
    among us not the worst. 
<P>
     The political results of a second Clinton term are certainly to be feared.  However, an even sadder result of a Clinton reelection would be that a majority of
    Americans would seem to believe that a man of Clinton's integrity is representative of the character of our nation. 
<P>
    It has been said that hypocrisy is vice's tribute to virtue. Well, if so, Clinton should be Master of
    Ceremonies for a Telethon for Virtue. Within hours of being elected president Clinton proclaimed
    that his administration would be the most ethical ever. This promise was made in the context of
    Clinton's campaign attacks upon the Bush administration that it claimed was unethical. 
    Clinton called attention to a State Department official who allegedly tried to pull Clinton's visa file to document Clinton's trip to the Soviet Union; a trip that was made while Clinton was leading anti-American rallies overseas. Clinton was "shocked" at the Bush campaign's "outrageous" use of official personnel and records to gain an advantage on a political adversary. Ironically,  Clinton can not understand why everyone seems so outraged by the hundreds of FBI files on Republican opponents that he and Craig
    Livingston had squirreled away in the White House. 
<P>
    What does it mean when the victor of this fall's campaign will take the oath of office to lead our
    nation into the next millennium? For me I want to believe the man who places his hand on the Bible
    and says, "I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United
    States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United
    States." 
<P>
    November 5th is national examination day. The question is one of character. Not Clinton's character
    but our character; our character as a nation and as individual voters. And, if the answer is Bill
    Clinton, we all fail. 
<P>

<H3>Three items today:</H3>
<P>   
<OL>
<LI><a href="#dole">On Tuesday Bob Dole</a> called Clinton a tax and spend liberal. Covering Dole's speech, CBS asserts that the "ex-deficit hawk" must "do more than criticize." NBC says Dole's latest themes reflect a "campaign of fear."

<FONT  SIZE=+2>1) Before the Economic Club of Detroit</FONT> on Tuesday Bob Dole
said Bill Clinton is a liberal bent on raising taxes. ABC's World
News Tonight on Tuesday (September 24) didn't mention the speech. 
<P>
On the CBS Evening News, Phil Jones charged that supporting a
tax cut means Dole is no longer concerned about the deficit.
Jones also worried that criticizing Clinton isn't the right
strategy. 
<P>
<DD>Jones reported: "The former Senator argued that voters have a
choice between two different visions of government."
<BR><DD>Dole: "He wants families to pinch their pennies so government can
spend more money. I've got a new idea. I want the government for
a change to pinch its pennies so the families will not have to
pinch theirs."
<BR><DD>Jones: "The ex-deficit hawk returned to the centerpiece of his
campaign, a 15 percent tax cut."
<BR><DD>Dole: "I know the critics say you can't do this, you can't cut
taxes and balance the budget. What they're really saying is that
they cannot do it."
<BR><DD>Jones: "Campaign aides claim they have private polls showing
President Clinton vulnerable on the tax issue. That's the reason
for this attack. But between now and election day the Republican
nominee has to do more than criticize. He's got to sell the Dole
plan."
<P>
After showing some of the same tax soundbites from Dole, on
NBC Nightly News David Bloom ran a clip of a new Clinton ad which
criticizes Dole's Senate record, emphasizing Dole's length of
service. Bloom then charged:
<BR><DD>"So now Dole who's complained about Clinton's campaign of fear is
taking a similar tack."
<BR><DD>Dole: "Secrets, secrets. Remember the FBI files that went to the
White House."
<BR><DD>Bloom: "With the election just six weeks away, calling Bill
Clinton a liberal might soon look tame. David Bloom, NBC News, Detroit."
<P>
<a name="hillary">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>2) "FDIC Report Says Mrs. Clinton's Work Was Used to
Deceive,"</FONT> declared the front page Washington Post headline on
Tuesday. The news was also played above the fold in The
Washington Times. But neither the Monday or Tuesday night ABC,
CBS or NBC evening shows mentioned the development. 
<P>
Post reporter Susan Schmidt's lead: "Hillary Rodham Clinton
drafted a real estate document that was used by an Arkansas S&L
to 'deceive' federal regulators in 1996 and pay more than $300,000
in questioned commissions to one of her law firm's well-connected
clients, a federal inspector general concluded yesterday. The
strongly worded report by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
inspector general found evidence that Clinton and her former law
partner Webster Hubbell were involved in dealings on behalf of
Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan that they have told federal
investigators under oath they cannot recall."
<P>
<a name="donaldson">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>3) An expert media observer</FONT> who had up close, insider
access to how the media covered Ronald Reagan's 1984 re-election
campaign says reporters are going a lot easier on Clinton this
year. The expert: Sam Donaldson. With Brit Hume out ill last
week, Donaldson returned to the campaign trail for the first time
since Reagan's years. And things have changed, USA Today's Peter
Johnson reported Monday (September 23):
<BR><DD>"Have the boys on the bus lost the fire in their bellies, the
one that fueled their cries of 'Mr. President! Mr. President!'
during President Reagan's years in office? ABC's Sam Donaldson
isn't saying, exactly, but suspects something's going on. Except
for CBS' Rita Braver, 'I have heard no reporter trying to ask the
President any question,' Donaldson said Friday....
<BR><DD>"What's this, Sam? Reporters going easy on Clinton? 'You're not
going to get me in a fight with these guys. They're my friends,'
said Donaldson, who covered the White House from 1977 to 1989.
'But there seems to a change in attitude or a different attitude
toward covering the President.'"
<P>
A USA Today reporter agrees. In his "Politics" column on
Monday, Richard Benedetto wrote:
<BR><DD>"As President Clinton's re-election campaign rolled through
six states in four days last week, it did so virtually unimpeded
by a White House press corps known for setting up roadblocks now
and then....He was left free to make a string of feel-good
speeches that won great play in the media and gave the desired
impression that the Clinton campaign is on a roll....
<BR><DD>"In 1992, a tough White House press corps rightly kept
President Bush's feet to the fire on domestic issues he would
rather have downplayed. But the 1996 crew appears less aggressive
with Clinton."
<P>We're bringing them to our side, one reporter at a time.

<LI> <a href="#dole">Bob Dole</a> is losing. What's to blame? The fact that he's failed
to nail down his conservative base? No, ABC says -- surprise,
surprise -- that he's moved "too far to the right."

<li> <a href="#gumbel">Bryant Gumbel</a> urges prayer for children because of the welfare

<p>
<br>
<br>
<a name="dole"></a>
<h3>1) </h3><dd>It could be argued that Bob Dole is losing because he
lacks conservative passion, that conservatives don't trust that
he'll follow through on his conservative promises. But that's not
a view ABC took Monday night. On the September 23 World News
Tonight reporter Dean Reynolds explored why Dole is behind in
Michigan's 8th congressional district, the Lansing area. In 1992
the networks didn't blame conservatives for Bush's impending loss
until October. This year ABC made an early start.
<dd>
    Reynolds found people happy with the economy and cynical
about the political process. Reynolds explained: "The same
cynicism that may deflect attacks on Clinton, seems to work
directly against Bob Dole with many voters here calling his 15
percent tax cut idea a political gimmick."
<dd>
    Following a soundbite from a teacher who asserted that you
can't cut taxes without increasing the deficit and who then
denounced Newt Gingrich, Reynolds relayed: "Many of the voters we
spoke with blamed Gingrich for last year's government shut down,
for a mean-spirited attitude generally, and for attempts to trim
Medicare specifically."
<dd>
    Reynolds then aired a soundbite from Ron Bell, a man on golf
course: "I think that anybody that came out as strong as Mr.
Gingrich did when he first came out regarding Medicare was
committing political suicide and I think the Republican Party
took too long before they tried to quiet him down."
<dd>Reynolds: "And Ron Bell is a life-long Republican."
<dd>    Interviewer, off camera: "Your party. Did it move too far to
the right?"
<dd>    Bell: "Yes, far too far to the right."
<dd>    Reynolds: "That may explain why Dole is having trouble
winning over women voters."
<dd>    Woman in restaurant: "I am a Republican and I'm having some
troubles with the platform because I'm pro-choice."
<dd>    2nd woman in restaurant: "I think abortion is not a political
issue. It has no business in politics."
<dd>    Reynolds: "And where there is support for Dole, it often
sounds lukewarm."
<dd>    3rd woman in restaurant: "I will support Dole and most
probably vote for him, but it would have been nice if we had a
different candidate.
<dd>
    Reynolds concluded his story: "Across Michigan's 8th
district, from the city streets to the fields of corn, the Dole
campaign is struggling, trailing and has six weeks to catch up."
<dd>
    So busy portraying Dole as "too far to the right," Reynolds
failed to consider that maybe voters don't believe his tax cut
promise because Dole has a long record of raising taxes over
conservative objections. Reynolds also failed to look at how
Reagan and Bush managed to win with a pro-life message.
<p>
<br>

<h3>2) </h3><dd>Monday's Washington Post "Reliable Source" column
revealed that "Former White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers,
35, and New York Times White House reporter Todd Purdum, 36, are
engaged after dating seriously for about a year." Myers is now
the liberal co-host of CNBC's Equal Time.
<p>
<br>
<br>
<a name="gumbel"></a>
<h3>3) </h3><dd>The Children Defense Fund's Marian Wright Edelman
appeared on Monday's Today show (September 23) to promote the
paperback release of her book titled Guide My Feet. It's a collection
of "prayers and meditations for children."
<dd>
    Bryant Gumbel asked her: "In light of the new welfare reform
bill, do you think the children need more prayers than ever
before?"
<dd>
    Yes, that when they grow up they won't have to watch biased
morning show hosts like Bryant Gumbel. -- Brent Baker

<H3> 1)</H3><DD>Ronald Reagan left office more than seven years ago,
but he's still fodder for liberal TV script writers. At the
beginning of Wednesday night's Rockford Files movie special on
CBS, "Jim Rockford" (a private investigator played by James
Garner, for those of you who missed the 1970s), arrives at a
birthday party for the father of a former girlfriend he hasn't
seen for 15 years. 
<DD>
Upon seeing Rockford, the father says to him: "I was glad to
hear Megan say that you might show. Hey, I bet the Reagan years
were good to you, huh? S&L investigations, defense contractor
fraud."
<DD>
Rockford responded: "Matter of fact."
<BR>

<a name="Dole"> </a>
<H3>2)</H3><DD>A few hours earlier Wednesday night (September 18) Dan
Rather opened the CBS Evening News: "Bob Dole unloads his
strongest attack yet blaming President Clinton personally and
directly for rising drug crime."
<DD>
He then began the show with this assessment of the themes of
each candidate that put Clinton in a more positive light: 
<DD>
"Bob Dole and Bill Clinton targeted each other today, on
each other's turf. In California Dole gave star billing to
President Clinton in a new attack blaming both the President and
Hollywood for what he says is a lax attitude on drug abuse.
President Clinton's theme today was let's protect the
environment, parks and public lands together. He used the Grand
Canyon as his backdrop to declare almost two million acres of
Utah off limits to developers."
<DD>
Reporter Phil Jones reported on Dole and included some doubt
about the effectiveness of Dole's anti-drug slogan and concluded
by noting that "only eleven percent blame the Clinton
administration for the [drug] problem." Rita Braver then
reported on Clinton move "to stake his claim as the
environmental President." But Braver didn't include any
consideration of how Clinton's move was an anti-property rights
land grab. ABC and NBC at least aired soundbites from upset Utah
Senator Orrin Hatch, but CBS aired no dissenting voice.

<BR>

<a name="CIA"></a>
<H3>3)</H3><DD>Thursday night's (September 19) InterNight on MSNBC
looked at the San Jose Mercury News story that the CIA 
coordinated cocaine sales in Los Angeles in the 1980s through a
Nicaraguan to pay for the Contras. The guests: the reporter
(Gary Webb), Jesse Jackson, a lawyer for a drug dealer,
Washington talk show host Joe Madison and his buddy, the wacky
as always Dick Gregory. The premise of course is that if the CIA
hadn't provided the drugs the residents of South Central would
not have become addicted to crack.
<DD>Here are a few of host Ed Gordon's less than probing
questions:
<DD>
    -- To Jesse Jackson: "Does it bother you that indeed, and I
think this is where you're going, the hypocrisy that might be
that those who backed the Contras at that time and said it was
for freedom fighters and the like would indeed turn their back
on this country's problems?"
<DD>
    -- To Dick Gregory: "Dick, I know that this is nothing new
to you in the sense of trying to keep people alert to what may
be going on across this country as relates to the government,
but as you compare it to things you've seen and heard in the
past where does this fall?"
<DD>
    -- To Joe Madison: "As Dick was saying, a conspiratorial
thing, something that is genocidal that many African-Americans
whisper and talk about that, or was it simply an economic
situation that they thought this was a quick way to make money
to send to the Contras?"

<H3>4)</H3><DD>Study, from the front page of the September MediaNomics 
published by the MRC's Free Market Project:
<DD><B>Tax Cuts Concern Reporters, Medicare Increases Do Not Deficit Chicken Hawks</B>
<DD>"At the Republican convention, Bob Dole pledged to cut income
taxes by 15 percent, balance the budget, and leave Social
Security and Medicare untouched. Tough-minded reporters believed
none of it and shared their skepticism with a national
television audience," writes the Weekly Standard's David Frum in
the September 9 issue of that magazine.
<DD>But then, according to Frum, "Two weeks later, the Democrats met
in convention and, to put it simply, lied through their teeth
about their plans for Medicare. They accused Republicans, in Al
Gore's words, of wanting to `give health insurance rip-off
artists a license to change Medicare, to let this program for
our seniors wither on the vine. That's why they want to replace
Bill Clinton. But we won't let them.' Those remarks are
blatantly untrue, both about the Republican plans and about
Clinton's own. And the media said...nothing."
<DD>Is Frum correct? Are reporters more skeptical of Bob Dole's tax
rhetoric than of Bill Clinton's Medicare rhetoric? Media
Research Center analysts reviewed all of the stories about
either tax cuts or Medicare on ABC's World News Tonight, CBS
Evening News, NBC Nightly News, and CNN's World Today during the
month of August. The MRC's findings: While network journalists
were ardent deficit hawks when reporting on tax cuts, they lost
their deficit-cutting zeal when Democrats denounced Republican
Medicare plans.
<DD>There were a total of 24 stories during the month that
questioned whether Bob Dole could both cut taxes and balance the
budget. Only two stories questioned whether Bill Clinton could
erase the deficit while not advancing Medicare reforms in his
second term.
<DD>The reaction to the unveiling of Dole's tax plan was the same
across the networks. "Since Dole would leave Social Security,
Medicare, and defense untouched," reported CBS News
correspondent Phil Jones, "it's still unclear what would be cut
in order to pay for his tax cut." According to CNN's Gene
Randall, "Bob Dole has produced an economic plan that is getting
mixed reviews even from Republicans. The bipartisan Concord
Coalition on Sunday warned against election-year tax-cut
Santas."
<DD>NBC's Mike Jensen offered that "most analysts say it's not good
economics. Bob Dole says about a fourth of the tax cuts would be
paid for by an expanding economy, but the rest would have to
come from spending cuts, and those haven't been spelled out
yet." Over at ABC, correspondent John Cochran claimed that "if
critics say Dole's tax plan would lead to budget deficits of the
size of those dating back to the Reagan era, then his campaign
simply isn't going to worry about it for now."
<DD>
But what about Bill Clinton and Medicare? Economics columnist
Robert Samuelson, in the September 4 Washington Post, pointed
out that in the upcoming years "the only way to avoid (or
minimize) much higher taxes, the [Congressional Budget Office]
said, would be a mix of an older retirement age, reduced
benefits and a shift of Medicare toward managed care. On
Medicare, the Republicans proposed precisely such a
shift...Clinton's demolition of this effort confounds the CBO's
sensible advice."
<DD>
Only two network reporters questioned whether leaving Medicare
alone could be compatible with balanced budgets. "A generation
of baby boomers begins retiring within a decade," ABC's Jerry
King pointed out. "So, the bad news is, unless the politicians
find a way to cut entitlement spending, today's deficit
reductions will be impossible to sustain." ABC's Jeff Greenfield
reported that "with the huge baby boomer generation retiring in
about 15 years, those entitlement programs could take every
single dollar of the budget."
<DD>
King and Greenfield were the only reporters concerned about how
to "pay for" automatic Medicare spending increases. If Bill
Clinton won't reform Medicare in his next term, why aren't
reporters asking him which taxes he will raise?

<h2><a name="quote">QUOTE OF THE DAY</a></h2><p>

<i>"They listened to those reports of the people turning down the
dials when negative responses were made in San Diego. He did it
on the high road. He said this was to be a campaign of ideas, not
insults, no personal attacks. And I think a final thought, Dan.
This was a convention that was well-planned and well-thought out.
They had their themes and they hit the mark every day. And the
President hit the mark tonight."<p>
 -- CBS reporter Ed Bradley,
after Clinton's speech.</i><p>

<h2><a name="nasty">"Nasty</a> Little Scandal" Prompts Some New Clinton Scrutiny;
 Dick Morris Story Mars Pro-Clinton Euphoria<p></h2></center>

    The networks generally praised Bill Clinton's acceptance
speech last night, but earlier in the evening coverage
concentrated on the resignation of Clinton campaign strategist
Dick Morris after revelations of a relationship with a
prostitute. The Morris news forced some networks to discuss
issues suppressed the first three nights: Clinton's character and
whether Morris pushed him artificially to the right.<p>

    "Two of the best and brightest of their political generation,
both baby boomers," marveled Tom Brokaw of Clinton and Gore.
ABC's Sam Donaldson offered: "Clinton always gives a great
speech, and this was another one of them. But the record shows
that the next day he may give a different speech, change his
mind." <p>

    -- CBS and NBC evening shows led with Morris, but ABC's Peter
Jennings seemed annoyed that he had to even mention the
allegations. "Here in Chicago," Jennings began World News
Tonight, "the President has been fine tuning, as they say, the
speech he will be giving to this convention and to the country
tonight. And he has a lot to be pleased about. A very upbeat
convention. A very successful train trip here with rising poll
numbers to accompany it. And a very important set of statistics
about the economy today, which he will certainly point to as
evidence that the country should re-elect him. And then along
comes a nasty little scandal to take the edge off the good news
at least for one day." <p>

    -- Questions about liberal influences on Clinton. Tom Brokaw,
on NBC Nightly News, asked Tim Russert "Does this open the door
then...to some of the President's old friends, who are more left
of center than right of center?" Dan Rather to Ted Kennedy in
prime time: "Bob Dole said today with Morris gone President
Clinton has only around him now liberal aides, and that's going
to hurt him?"<p>

    --  Character issue raised on CNN and NBC, which were the
only networks to detail the Morris story. On the 7pm ET Inside
Politics, Judy Woodruff inquired of Vernon Jordan: "Does it say
anything about the President's judgment that he would turn again
and again over 20 years to a man like Dick Morris with the sort
of personal problems that he allegedly has?" As prime time began,
only CNN's Bernie Kalb and NBC's Lisa Myers noted the Star
reported Morris used a Clinton campaign hotel room and that he
allowed the woman to listen in on phone calls with Clinton.<p>

    -- The rank hypocrisy of Al Gore's speech Wednesday night
went unmentioned Thursday morning and evening. Gore said his
sister's death from lung cancer in 1984 prompted his anti-tobacco
crusade, but in 1988 he boasted of growing and selling tobacco.
The only exception came on CNN's Crossfire which showed the 1988
clip of Gore.<p>

<center><h2><a name="ted">The</a> Orator of "Robert Bork's America" Goes Negative Again 
Ted Kennedy's Hit Speech Goes Uncriticized</center></h2><p>

    Reporters continued to miss the hypocrisy of Clinton's
proclamation of an "ideas, not insults" campaign when matched
with the attack-dog rhetoric of podium speakers. Last night, Ted
Kennedy used the exact same literary device that two weeks ago
fueled media criticism of Republican Senator Kay Bailey
Hutchison. <p>

    Said Kennedy of the GOP platform: "It is the radical wish
list of the education-cutting, environmental-trashing,
Medicare-slashing, choice-denying, tolerance-repudiating,
gay-bashing, Social Security-threatening, assault-rifle-coddling,
government-closing, tax loophole-granting....minimum
wage-opposing Republican majority that dominated the delegations
in San Diego" <p>

    -- NBC's Lisa Myers asked Hutchison in San Diego: "Do you
think you went too far?" On PBS, Tom Brokaw said last night:
"Senator Edward M. Kennedy, still in full voice after all these
years in the United States Senate. The proud champion of the
liberal cause, addressing this convention hall once again as he
does every four years."<p>

    -- On CNN,Bernard Shaw asserted: "Sixteen years ago in New
York's Madison Square Garden, Sen. Edward Kennedy rallied the
Democratic Party. Tonight, he has done it again in Chicago." Ken
Bode added: "You need a partisan speech, one that puts it to the
other party. You get it at any convention. Ted Kennedy does it as
well as anybody could do it. Elder statesman of the party.
Eloquent."<p>

   -- CNN's Bill Schneider found code words: "What they're trying
to do is take advantage of Dole's age and portray him as sort of
out of it. He's kind of irrelevant. He's kind of a dupe. That the
ideas are the sinister ideas of Newt Gingrich, and even Jack Kemp
with his supply-side ideas." But that attack theme drew no
criticism.<p>

    -- Later, CNN's Judy Woodruff interviewed Kennedy: "Do you
really believe that the Republicans are as dangerous, that Bob
Dole is as dangerous, as you described in your remarks?" Bernard
Shaw queried: "You had a who's who of names tonight: Pat
Buchanan, Newt Gingrich, Jack Kemp, Rush Limbaugh, Ralph Reed,
Pat Robertson. What were you driving at?"<p>

    -- On CBS, where Bob Schieffer asked Sen. Hutchison in San
Diego how she felt being "Attack Dog Hutchison," Dan Rather
interviewed Kennedy last night but failed to ask him about the
speech or its tone.<p>


<center><h2><a name="convention">Convention</a>-Inspired Ratherisms</center></h2><p>

    Special events often inspire the folksy aphorisms known as
Ratherisms: <p>

    This is your classic case of two pounds of politics in a
one-pound bag. This hall is only a third the size of the Houston
Astrodome, where the last Republican convention was held." -- 
Dan Rather, leading off Republican coverage, August 12.<p>

    -- "She's expected to hit President Clinton rhetorically with
everything short of a tire tube." -- Rather on Kay Bailey

    -- "It looks like California's Governor Pete Wilson is out of
the doghouse. You know from his view he's been put so far back in
the doghouse they had to FedEx him daylight." -- Rather during
August 14 Republican convention coverage. <p>

    -- "The Vice President of the United States, Albert Gore Jr.
of Tennessee, age 48, is about to give an address in which he is
widely expected to hit Republicans with everything short of a
window weight." -- During August 28 Democratic convention.<p>

    -- "The consensus in the hall is that Albert Gore has scored
with what Harry Caray, the famous Chicago baseball announcer,
might call a home run ball." -- Rather during CBS Democratic
convention coverage, August 28. <p>

<h3>Dick Morris, Family Man</h3>

    Just a day before the Dick Morris prostitute story broke, USA
Today ran a profile. Susan Page's front page piece Wednesday
included this line: "He is a small man and a dapper dresser,
openly devoted to his no-nonsense wife."<p>


<h3>Moderate Liberalism</h3><p>

    Wednesday's New York Times insisted the Democratic Party
defined centrism, but the story listed some very liberal views.
The Democratic "platform takes a middle ground between the
unfettered capitalism and government-enforced morality es- poused
by Republicans and the welfare-state economics and Aquarian
values that once formed Democrats' image," reported David
Rosenbaum.<p>

    Four paragraphs later Rosenbaum summarized the "middle
ground" policies: "The Democrats call for government-paid
abortions for poor women, full civil rights for homosexuals, a
strong commitment to public schools, gun control, tobacco
regulations, a continuation of affirmative action programs and a
greater emphasis on environmental protection than on the
development of resources."<p>


<h3>Welfare Worries</h3><p>

    Clinton's promise to "fix" welfare reform didn't prompt
questions about his backing down on a promise. Instead, reporters
pressed from the left. On CBS last night Ed Bradley cornered U.S.
Rep. Ron Dellums: "I know you saw it not as welfare reform but
more as a budget cut. What does he have to do to fix it?" And,
"The President is expected to say tonight that he's going to
propose a $3.5 billion jobs program for welfare recipients, is
that enough?"<p>

<i>"But with these guys coming [Jesse Jackson and Mario Cuomo], it
was kind of like your young love coming back and oh, I remember
when I was, you know, young and in love with this guy who was
totally unacceptable, and I did the right thing by marrying the

<center><h2><a name="ignoring">Networks Forget 1988 Tobacco-Growing Boast 
Ignoring Al Gore's Inaccuracy, Nastiness</a></h2></center><p>

    The networks delivered praise for Al Gore's speech last
night, ignoring his factual inaccuracies and failing to note how
he had boasted of growing tobacco as recently as 1988, four years
after the death of his sister from lung cancer. After Gore's
talk, in which he explained that his sister's death motivated his
anti-tobacco views, the networks did talk to tobacco-state
delegates. NBC's David Bloom spoke to a Tennessee delegate who
"does not agree with this demonization of this industry."<p>

    "Well, Dan, in a word it was a barnburner," gushed Bob
Schieffer on CBS last night. Though Gore said Republicans wish to
allow "more poison in our air and drinking water," Schieffer
didn't find him nasty: "This was an old-fashioned poli- tical
speech, the kind of speech that politicians used to give before
politics turned so nasty with all those commercials on
television." Though Peter Jennings noted the "attack dog" role of
a VP, no one  mentioned how Gore falsely accused the GOP of
"cutting" Medicare, of wanting it to "wither on the vine," or his
claim of 100,000 new cops on the street. Last Sunday
Scripps-Howard pegged the number at 12,000.<p>

    The New York Times reported July 3 that in 1988, Al Gore told
an audience of tobacco farmers: "Throughout most of my life, I
raised tobacco. I want you to know that with my own hands, all of
my life, I put it in the plant beds and transferred it. I've hoed
it. I've dug in it. I've sprayed it, I've chopped it, I've
shredded it, spiked it, put it in the barn and stripped it and
sold it." No network mentioned this boast, but ABC, NBC and CNN
did suggest hypocrisy. Jennings noted that "tobacco companies are
here in Chicago wining and dining the hierarchy of the Democratic
Party." NBC's Tom Brokaw recalled that "the Gore family were
tobacco farmers." On CNN, Judy Woodruff suggested that Gore "was
responding to what was said in San Diego," where his tobacco
roots were highlighted.<p>

    -- Clinton's week of new spending promises hasn't generated
a flurry of questions about how his plans will be paid for, but
Dole's tax cut plan led to concern in San Diego about its impact
on the deficit. One exception: Early in prime time last night
CNN's Charles Bierbauer reviewed Clinton's spending plans and
noted "Republicans say that is the road back to big government."<p>

    -- In stark contrast to San Diego, the networks failed to
describe Tuesday speeches as harsh or mean attacks. The morning
shows didn't raise the idea in interviews with Democratic guests.<p>


    -- The power of unions within the Democratic Party finally
gets highlighted as ABC's World News Tonight and CNN in prime
time examine their role. See page 3. But for CBS the problem
isn't union influence moving the party left, but how President
Clinton is too conservative for the rank and file. <p>

<center><h2><a name="no">More Raves for Jackson & Cuomo, Citations of GOP "Sniping"
No Snarling Partisan Negativity in Chicago?</p></center></h2></a>

    Wednesday marked Day Two of ignoring negativity from the
podium in Chicago:<p>

    -- On ABC's World News Tonight, Peter Jennings argued: "There
was a rather personal attack on President Clinton by Mr. Dole."
In the ABC clip, Dole said: "Tonight they'll bash Republicans.
Tomorrow night the President will sound to everybody 'If you're
for it, I'm for it. If Bob Dole's for it, I'm for it. If Jesse
Helms is for it, I'm for it. Whoever is for it, I'm for it, and
that's why you should re-elect me, because I don't have any
philosophy, I don't have any beliefs, I don't have any
commitments." Sounds a lot like network complaints about welfare
reform.<p>

    Jim Wooten raved over Jackson and Cuomo: "For a quick moment,
deja vu...That old-fashioned voice, full-throated, fierce,
raising the rafters worth of Chicago conventions...This was a
glimpse of conventions past, when liberals were still the lions
of the party and rhetoric roared....And the delegates, most of
them much more liberal than their convention projects of their
party, celebrated this little touch of yesterday." Wooten said
Hillary "answered Republican sniping at her book on raising
children."<p>

    -- CBS Evening News correspondent Bob Schieffer echoed
Wooten: "During the Republican convention, the Doles disparaged
Mrs. Clinton's book It Takes A Village, saying instead it takes a
family to properly raise a child."<p>

    -- NBC's Tom Brokaw called Jesse Jackson "The father who
began on the outside looking in, the fiery liberal voice of
protest and change...The old lion still has his roar."
The Wednesday morning shows took the same approach to negativity:<p>

    -- CBS This Morning co-host Jose Diaz-Balart suggested: "Mrs.
Clinton, you know, has been the target of a lot of attacks by the
Republican Party. She decided not to answer them, although she
did say it takes a village."<p>

    -- On NBC's Today, Jim Miklaszewski proclaimed: "This was the
night for the liberals. Jesse Jackson electrified the delegates,
exhorting them not to abandon Democratic liberal traditions."
Bryant Gumbel asked: "Would it be fair to say she wasn't as
strident, as hard-edged last night as usual?" Miklaszewski
dissented from the media's party line: "If you listen closely, I
thought she was just as hard-edged as ever."<p>

    -- ABC's Good Morning America co-host Charles Gibson
explained: "Mrs. Clinton expressed the core idea of the evening,
that government ought to be a proactive positive force, that idea
given forceful voice by two liberal icons who opposed President
Clinton's signing of welfare reform...the First Lady relied not
on her legal experience -- there would be no harsh edges on this
night -- but on her experience as a mother to push for new
legislation."<p>

    ABC interviewed Leon Panetta, and NBC interviewed the First
Lady, but asked no questions about negativity. Two weeks ago, the
morning shows all decried "bashing":<p>

   -- CBS This Morning co-host Jane Robelot reported August 14:
"It was unofficially Bash Bill Night last night in San
Diego...Speaker after Republican speaker went after the man with
a vengeance, including the keynoter, Susan Molinari."<p>

   -- "Congresswoman Susan Molinari took on the role of attack
dog last night, using her keynote address to attack the
President," Bryant Gumbel led off NBC's Today.<p>

    -- Good Morning America anchor Elizabeth Vargas asserted:
"Some of the harshest words were from Kay Bailey Hutchison, who
tried to paint the President as a tax-and-spend liberal." Charles
Gibson added: "Polls will tell you these days that people do not
want much partisanship in their politics, but they got it at the
Republican convention last night. There were attacks on President
Clinton's credibility, integrity, even his eating habits."<p>


<center><h2><a name="where">Broder</a> Sounds A Rare Skeptical Note on Clinton, Welfare Fixer
Where Are Welfare Questions from the Right?</center></h2><p>

    Clinton officials assured conventioneers that he will "fix"
welfare reform after the election. That prompted The Washington
Post's David Broder, on CNN Tuesday night, to explain that
Democrats will be "the slickest sales people in the country" if
they cast Clinton as welfare's savior: "That's as logical as
saying that the guy who fumbled the ball on the two-yard line
ought to be put back in because he's the one who might carry it
through the next time." The networks have yet to suggest that his
welfare fix assurance might mean he really hasn't moved right on
the issue. Instead, liberal questions on welfare reform continued
on Wednesday night: <p>

    -- CBS reporter Ed Bradley asked Rep. John Lewis: "It's going
to be difficult, given the positions he's taken, particularly on
welfare, to get some people out?"<p>

    -- CNN's Gene Randall inquired of NAACP leader Kweisi Mfume:
"Do you think the President's signature on the welfare rights
bill will do him any harm politically in the African-American
community?"<p>

   -- On CNN Bob Franken asked Sen. Daniel Moynihan: "You of
course are very angry about the President signing the  welfare
legislation. But you haven't talked about it here. Why?" She
followed up: "Can the President, as many people suggest, fix the
welfare legislation in a second term?"<p>

    -- At the top of Tuesday's Nightline on the plight of
Chicago's poor, Ted Koppel warned: "They live literally in the
shadow of the convention in Chicago, but with their benefits now
in doubt, many feel betrayed by the President and the Democrats,
and look forward only to uncertainty."<p>



<center><h2><a name="labor">Labor's</a> Political Intolerance, Mob Ties Surface on TV
ABC, CNN Touch on Unions' Peculiar Politics</center></h2><p>

    While the labor unions have yet to receive the sort of Darth
Vader treatment reserved for Republican interest groups like the
Christian Coalition or the NRA, some reporters have presented
critical looks at the exercise of union power.<p>

    -- Last night, CNN became the first network to address the
issue of the unions' political intolerance, taking dues money
from Republican union members to elect Democrats. Reporter Wolf
Blitzer asked AFL-CIO chief John Sweeney: "Many of your members
are Republicans. How do you explain to them that you're using, in
effect, their dues to help elect Democrats?"<p>

    -- CNN campaign finance reporter Brooks Jackson delivered a
story last night on the unions' political campaign in which he
observed: "So Bill Clinton says the era of big government is
over? Not at the Democratic convention, where unionized
government workers are suiting up for battle against
Republicans."<p>

    -- On Tuesday's World News Tonight, ABC's Brian Ross
reported: "In the world of big money and Democratic politics on
public display this week in Chicago, this man holds a special
place. His name is Arthur Coia, who despite being president of a
labor union the FBI says has long been controlled by the Mafia,
the Laborers International has become one of the Democrats' top
money people, raising millions and gaining him special access to
the Clinton White House....In the last two years, the Clinton
administration has gone all out to court Coia and his union money
with invitations to the White House and an appearance by the
First Lady at a big union conference."<p>

    Ross added detail: "In an abrupt change of plans that raised
questions about whether the union's money to the Democrats had
bought it some kind of sweetheart deal, prosecutors dropped the
allegations and instead quietly negotiated a deal with Coia that
let him keep his job and put him in charge of cleaning up the
union."<p>


<center><h2><a name="sidebites">SIDEBITES</a></center></h2><p>

<h3>Base Bias</h3><p>

    CBS Evening News is taking two different approaches to the
passionate poles that create each party's base. The day before
the Republican convention, CBS reporter John Roberts suggested
"hard-line anti-abortionists" controlled the Republican Party:
"Delegates are pursuing their own agendas and forcing party
leaders, including Dole, to fall into line behind them...so far
he rogue elephants seem to be calling the shots." <p>

    But on last night's broadcast, reporter Harry Smith's piece
on unions didn't talk about ideologically extreme unions pushing
around the party, but how Bill Clinton has failed to be liberal
enough for them:<p>

    "It still takes steel to make America's cars. It still takes
labor to get a Democrat elected President. But talk to the union
rank and file, and you'll find that their enthusiasm is less than
red hot.... We talked with United Auto Workers in Dearborn,
Michigan this week. Their biggest gripe: Bill Clinton's support
of the North American Free Trade Agreement...Organized labor will
invest millions of dollars to get Bill Clinton elected this fall.
These dues-paying members wonder if they are still getting their
money's worth."<p>


<h3>Poor Ann</h3><p>

    Tom Brokaw didn't ask about harsh negativity during a Tuesday
night interview with former Texas Gov. Ann Richards, who
"delivered that rollicking keynote speech against George Bush not
so long ago." Brokaw asked about strong women: "You paid the
price to some degree. You lost the governorship of Texas because
this country still is a little bit schizoid, isn't it, about the
role of women in American politics?" <p>


<h3>Brokaw: Right is Wrong</h3><p>

    Tom Brokaw was hit Tuesday with an anti-GOP comment he made
in San Diego. Freelance newsman Marc Morano showed him a quote,
cited in Media Reality Check '96, in which Brokaw asked rape
victim Jan Licence after her speech: "Do you think this is a
party that is dominated by men and this convention is dominated
by men as well...Do you think before tonight they thought very
much about what happens in America with rape?" <p>

    Brokaw read the quote, admitted "I did ask her that, which I
think is a fair question," then walked away. Earlier, Morano
asked why GOP delegates distrusted the media but Democrats don't.
Brokaw asserted that it's just because conservatives don't like
change: "I think a lot of reporters in fact, come from working
class, activist backgrounds. But I don't think that it really
colors the way that they report things and the conservatives
generally stand for the status quo and news is about change."<p>


<h3>Here's My Room Key!</h3><p>

    Great publicity isn't the only thing Bill Clinton picked up
on his train trip. Reporting on crowd reaction to Clinton's stop
at Michigan State University, NBC Nightly News on Wednesday found
one very giving student. Answering what she could give the
President, she yelled, "I'll give him my room key!" <p>


<h3>Used to Double Standard</h3><p>

    Reporters complained about the lack of hard news in San
Diego, but aren't doing so in Chicago. Radio host Don Imus asked
CBS's Bob Schieffer Wednesday morning why. Talk Daily reported
his response: "I guess we kind of got used to it."<p>

<a name="quote">QUOTE</a> OF THE DAY<p>

<i>"This has been a difficult couple of years for you. Did that
applause, the way you've been treated here, the way people have
been reacting to you, kind of make it all go away?" <p>
-- NBC's Maria Shriver in an exclusive interview with Hillary Clinton
after her August 27 speech </i>><p>

<center><h2><a name="networks">Networks</a> Concede It was a Liberal Night, But...
Hillary Asked to Respond to "Bitter Attacks"<p></center></h2>

    On Tuesday night the networks declared that speakers Mario
Cuomo, Jesse Jackson, and Hillary Clinton were liberals, but
instead of castigating Cuomo and Jackson for their negative
speeches, as they did with speakers in San Diego, they praised
their eloquence.  Like Monday night,
the Democrats again escaped any scrutiny of their intolerance on
abortion as the three broadcast networks each aired stories on
the disastrous impact of welfare reform.<p>

    -- Hillary portrayed as the victim of unwarranted Republican
attacks and given plenty of opportunities to fire back. Just
after she left the podium, NBC's Maria Shriver asked her nine
softball questions. See quote of the day below. For instance,
"You are credited with really redefining the role of First Lady
and for doing that, you've taken a lot of heat, a lot of
criticism. As you look back, do you wished you'd redefined it a
little less?" On CBS, Bob Schieffer asked her: "Weren't you a
little offended when he [Bob Dole] made the reference he did [to
your book]?" CNN's Wolf Blitzer inquired of her: "What goes
through your mind when you hear some of these bitter attacks
against you?"<p>

    -- The three big speakers were tagged liberal by all but CBS.
Peter Jennings called Cuomo and Jackson the "senior liberals in
the party," and ABC's Jeff Greenfield described Hillary Clinton's
speech as "liberalism lite." Tom Brokaw referred to Cuomo's
"traditional liberal litany." CNN's Bill Schneider noted Hillary
Clinton's "liberal policy agenda." Whitewater was mentioned twice
by NBC last night; CNN's Judy Woodruff mentioned it Monday night.<p>

    -- The wealth of Democratic delegates and the quota system
that selected them have gone unmentioned in prime time so far. A
graphic on last night's NBC Nightly News reported 35 percent earn
over $100,000. In San Diego, 38 percent fell in that category,
prompting CBS, CNN and NBC to ask if the GOP delegates were out
of touch. Some reporters have noted that Democrats are split
50-50 male-female, but none has wondered if the quota system
might contradict party rhetoric about opposing quotas.<p>

    -- Abortion, the focus of the networks in San Diego, has been
blown aside in Chicago. Kate Michelman, head of the National
Abortion Rights Action League and a supporter of partial birth
abortion, addressed the convention. But her early evening speech
failed to spur any talk about extremism. The Democrats at the
last minute also allowed pro-life Rep. Tony Hall to speak, but
that action didn't generate any media interest in why the
Democrats felt compelled to make the move. Abortion came up only
on CNN, but before prime time, as Judy Woodruff interviewed
former Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey on the 7pm ET Inside
Politics.<p>

    -- Welfare reform reported from the viewpoint of potential
victims on ABC, CBS and NBC without any voices in favor of the
new law. <p>



<center><h2><a name="Kay">Slashing</a> Attacks on GOP Never Scorned As Negative
Reporters Swoon Over Cuomo, Jackson</center></h2><p>

    On Tuesday night in San Diego, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and
Rep. Susan Molinari made jokey remarks about President Clinton
and were tagged as "attack dogs." Last night, Jesse Jackson
declared: "President Clinton has been our first line of defense
against the Newt Gingrich contract, America's right-wing assault
on our elderly, our students, and our civil rights." Mario Cuomo
announced: "The Republicans are the real threat. They are the
real threat to our women. They are the real threat to our
children. They are the real threat to clean air, clean water, and
the rich landscape of America...in the end, Bill Clinton spells
hope and Republicans spell disaster." Did the media see "slashing
partisan attacks"? Hardly. Note each network's contrast: <p>

    -- CNN's Ken Bode oozed: "Convention rhetoric has not been
much better than it was tonight, particularly with Jesse Jackson.
And of course, no one's going to forget for some time the First
Lady's speech, which was also terrific."  Farai Chideya gushed:
"Jesse Jackson's speech was extraordinary in its sense of hope,
purpose, and vision." Bob Franken asked Andrew Cuomo: "It was
quite a scene watching as they listened to the speech. You really
are a fan of his speaking style. It's amazing, isn't it?"
In San Diego, CNN's Judy Woodruff declared: "Well, they said it
was going to be a Clinton-bashing night at the Republican
convention, Bernie, and I think that is just what we heard from
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison." Bernard Shaw replied: "And the
bashing will continue when the keynote speaker, Susan Molinari,
steps up there."<p>

    -- Last night, ABC's Peter Jennings asserted: "Just a little
earlier this evening going out of their way, the Democrats were,
to show they embrace the differences among them or between them,
they put forward to speak two of the senior liberals in the party
who did more than anything else on this day to energize this
crowd."<p>
    In San Diego, Jennings began: "Expect tonight to see very
much the attacks on President Clinton ratcheted up to a much
greater degree than they have been so far." Sam Donaldson added:
"Tonight, as you say, Peter, they are expecting red
meat...Tonight they want to hear President Clinton bashed." <p>

    -- Last night, Dan Rather suggested on CBS: "Mrs. Clinton
received a ringing defense during what was clearly the most
stirring speech of the convention so far." Bob Schieffer added:
"The man who made that speech was Jesse Jackson, who can make a
speech when he sets his mind to it. But his biggest applause line
came when he said that Democrats must set up a line of defense to
protect the old and the young from the Republican assault, and
then he said, and to set up a line of defense against their
vicious attacks on the First Lady. The place just went wild when
he said that."<p>
    In San Diego, Rather said Hutchison "is expected to hit
President Clinton rhetorically with everything short of a tire
tube." Schieffer asked the Senator: "I must say it's Attack Dog
Hutchison tonight. How do you feel in this new role?" <p>

    -- Last night, Tom Brokaw noted: "The old lion has not lost
its roar. There are very few speakers left in America who can
switch on a hall like Jesse Jackson. He has done it so many times
in the past. He began tonight in more muted tones, but of course,it's almost irresistible for him, and it grows out of a very deep
passion." Tim Russert added: "The crowd is letting loose a little
bit because the passion and the philosophy of Jesse Jackson is
something they very much ascribe to, and by him bridging the gap
and endorsing Bill Clinton so wholeheartedly, it's a plus for
Bill Clinton."<p>
    In San Diego, Brokaw told NBC viewers: "The party knows
better than anyone else it has to lower the threshhold of
perceived meanness on the part of the country." Russert
underlined the point: "Key words: mean-spirited and extremist.
They want to avoid those labels...I think the speech by Senator
Hutchison is dangerous, Tom, because she uses words that could be
interpreted by some people as mean."<p>



<center><h2><a name="most">"Most Economists"</a> Blame Spending, Not Tax Cuts for Deficit
New Survey Proves Dole Tax Cut News Wrong</center></h2><p>
    A just released survey of 700 economists found that "52
percent blame the growth of the federal deficit in the 1980s on
increased government spending more than on the Reagan tax cut,"
which was blamed by 48 percent. The fact that economists are
about evenly split contradicts many recent media reports.<p>

    "Most economists say the Reagan tax cuts did worsen the
budget deficit and many are skeptical of Dole's plan," announced
reporter David Bloom on the August 5 NBC Nightly News. Colleague
Mike Jensen insisted a few minutes later that "most analysts say
it's not good economics."<p>

    The next morning a headline over a Washington Post news story
declared: "Economists Question Dole's Plan." The headline over a
Boston Globe news story asserted: "Economists Cool to Dole's
Tax-Cut Plan: Candidate Speaks of Growth, but Analysts See No Big
Payoff."  <p>

    The poll of 700 members of the American Economics Association
discovered that 81 percent agreed that the Reagan tax cuts
increased economic growth. A plurality of 42 percent "want to see
the next Congress put a high priority on both restraining
government spending and cutting taxes," matching the Dole-Kemp
promise.<p>

    William Adams, a public administration professor at George
Washington University, directed the poll conducted August 19-21.
Though reported in this week's Weekly Standard and in Tuesday's
Washington Times, none of the above-mentioned outlets have yet
bothered to revise their claims.<p>


<center><h2><a name="voices">Voices</a> In Favor of Welfare Reform Vetoed by Networks
Welfare-State Television Sells the Liberal Line</center></h2><p>

    All three networks featured stories last night critical of
the new welfare reform law:<p>

    -- On NBC Nightly News, Tom Brokaw presented his view: "There
are serious questions about what happens to these people after
they're taken off the welfare rolls. Andrea Mitchell went to
Indiana to look at the conflict between fixing the system and
doing the right thing by people." Mitchell featured no welfare
reform proponents, just social workers, Jesse Jackson, and
impending victims: "Kimberly Gilbert will get benefits for two
years. After that, she's cut off, whether or not she finds a job.
That deadline is near for Charla Milton. Unable to find work, she
is terrified."<p>

    -- On ABC's World News Tonight, Peter Jennings suggested:
"Maybe if he is reelected, Mr. Clinton will do something to
reverse himself on welfare reform. Many of these delegates hope
so." Reporter Erin Hayes asked where the jobs would come from to
support welfare recipients: "An Urban League study found in
Chicago there are six times as many people who need work as there
are entry-level jobs available." Hayes aired no voices favoring
welfare reform, and concluded: "There is another concern as well:
the young children. When their mothers are made to go to work,
who will take care of them? Right now, no one really has an
answer. With so much still uncertain about welfare reform, it is
no wonder there is fear out there."<p>

    -- On the CBS Evening News, reporter Harry Smith also ignored
taxpayers and focused on victims: "We talked to four welfare moms
from across Chicago. They feel like they are this year's
political target...President Clinton seemed deaf to protests last
week when he signed the new welfare cuts into law. Cuts many
Americans support, but cuts these women think go too far." Smith
concluded: "Neighborhoods like Cabrini-Green have more than their
share of misery. Folks around here think misery is only going to
grow. Their long faith in the Democratic Party has been shaken,
and the actions of President Clinton confirm their fear that the
poor just do not count."<p>

<center><h2><a name="sidebites">SIDEBITES</center></h2><p>

<h3>Jack E. White Hot</h3><p>

    Time's Jack E. White exemplified the media's left-wing anger
against welfare reform in the September 2 issue: "Did anyone else
find it unnerving that only days before Bill Clinton signed a
welfare-reform law that will plunge more than a million children
into official poverty, he marked his 50th birthday with glitzy
celebrations in New York City that added $10 million to his
party's bulging campaign war chest? Shades of Marie Antoinette,
Newt Gingrich, and Jesse Helms." White complained: "As Jesse
Jackson has repeatedly and unavailingly pointed out, it makes
little sense to elect a Democrat if he governs like a
conservative Republican."<p>


<h3>Harshly Negative Attack</h3><p>

    In the same issue, Time columnist Margaret Carlson lit into 
the marriage of Bob and Elizabeth Dole: "Any time the Doles play
the family-values card, they are betting that divorce and
remarriage wipe the slate clean and stop the questions -- that
suddenly leaving your marriage and asking for an `emergency
divorce,' as Dole did from his first wife (when his daughter was
17), is morally equivalent if not superior to sticking out the
pain in your marriage and keeping a family together, as the
Clintons did...Now being divorced gives you a political pass, and
staying married gets you an inquisition."<p>


<h3>No Liberal Bias</h3><p>

    CBS News reporter Bob Schieffer told freelance newsman Marc
Morano in Chicago on Tuesday that the media don't tilt left: "I
think the media pretty well reflect American society. You know,
it's like when we had a draft army. You'd find one example of
everything there."<p>


<h3>Bayh vs. Molinari</h3><p>

    Tom Brokaw put GOP keynoter Susan Molinari on the defensive
when he interviewed her two weeks ago on the NBC Nightly News,
but last night he took a more deferential approach in
interviewing Democratic keynote speaker Gov. Evan Bayh.
Molinari faced seven straight questions about abortion and women:
"So they look at the platform. It's pretty rigid in its language
on abortion. Then people like Susan Molinari and Jack Kemp and
Bob Dole say don't pay attention to the platform, pay attention
to what we do."<p>

    Brokaw also pressed Bayh from the left, but only made him
answer one hostile question: "If there is a debate in the party
at the moment, it is about welfare reform. A lot of Democrats, in
Congress especially, think we have gone too far, too fast, that a
lot of children, more than a million, could be put below the
poverty line." <p>

    Unlike with Molinari, Brokaw played up Bayh's rising star
status: "When you walk out tonight to deliver that keynote
speech, all over this hall and in the television booths and in
the print section, people are going to be saying `Evan Bayh,
future candidate for President of the United States. This is a
big moment for him.' You can't completely erase that from your
thinking?"<p>


<h3>Calling J.C. Watts</h3><p>

    Two weeks ago, ABC, CBS, and NBC carried none of Rep. J.C.
Watts' speech, which occurred during their live 10pm ET hour,
though GOP delegates loved it. Last night, ABC ran excerpts of
the pre-10pm ET addresses of Jesse Jackson and Mario Cuomo (and
on Nightline). CBS showed some Jackson clips.<p>

<i>"We were just reminded in that moving film that we saw here of
your lifelong work as an advocate for children's causes. And yet,
late last week, your husband signed a welfare reform bill that as
you know, Senator Patrick Moynihan and other welfare experts are
saying is going to throw a million children into poverty. Does
that legislation threaten to undo so much of what you've worked
for over the years?"<p>
-- CNN's Judy Woodruff to Hillary Clinton,
August 26 interview</i><p> 

<center><h2><a name="Another">Another</a> Day of Questions from the Left
Liberal Delegates, But Party's Too Conservative</center></h2><p>

    Viewers of last night's network coverage could have learned
how Democratic delegates are outside the mainstream, but they
heard nothing about controversies like abortion, as the networks
again worried Clinton had gone too far right.<p>

    -- CBS and CNN attempted to make Hillary Clinton the martyr
of harsh San Diego attacks and ask her welfare questions from the
left. <p>

    -- Network reporters worried that the party has become too
conservative as they grilled Democrats for not opposing the
welfare reform bill. <p>

    -- ABC, CNN and PBS mentioned the liberal nature of the
delegates at least once, but not NBC or CBS in prime time. "We
know from our survey that these delgates are far to the left of
the mainstream just as the Republicans were to the right of the
mainstream," ABC's Sam Donaldson declared last night. Unions also
got brief attention. Tom Brokaw referred to "a very unusually
high representation of labor down on the floor" and on CBS Dan
Rather also noted the labor angle.<p>

    -- Three networks mentioned tobacco funding of the
convention, but none noted the hypocrisy of Democrats taking
money from an industry they rail against. On CNN in prime time
Bill Schneider explained that the NRA and tobacco lobby are the
"least popular" special interests "and those are the two that the
Democrats are going to try to showcase as linked to the
Republican Party." On World News Tonight yesterday ABC's intrepid
Brian Ross cited a brunch cruise for delegates "put on by the
Brown and Williamson tobacco company" and how "Philip Morris has
the most extensive operation with the same group of back room
operatives who ran things in San Diego." NBC's Tom Brokaw
referred to a tobacco-sponsored event where delegates wore "Keep
the FDA off the farm" buttons. <p>

    -- Only two reporters questioned the authenticity of
Democratic claims to moderation. During the PBS-NBC joint
broadcast, Lisa Myers asked a delegate: "You have a President who
talks like a Republican, you have a platform that is so centrist
that some critics say it's a con job. Is this essentially,
though, a liberal party?" CNN's Judy Woodruff asked Bob Kerrey if
Clinton will go left after the election.<p>

    After scant attention Sunday, Democratic suppression of
abortion debate fell completely off TV screens.<P255D> In all of
Monday's prime time coverage no reporter or anchor raised the
topic, though Bob Casey, the pro-life former Governor of
Pennsylvania, gave a speech at another Chicago location on the
party's intolerance. <p>

<center><h2><a name="poor">CNN, CBS Ask First Lady About Harsh GOP Attacks, Welfare:
Poor Hillary, Wondering If It's Worth It</a></center></h2><p>

   In 1992, then-PBS anchor Judy Woodruff gave a soft convention
interview to Hillary Clinton in July, but blistered Barbara Bush
in August in Houston with a welter of accusatory questions about
the inappropriateness of Bush campaign tactics. On last night's
Inside Politics on CNN, Woodruff devoted her interview to
eliciting Hillary Clinton's responses to Republican attacks:<p>

    -- "Let me take you back to San Diego. Bob Dole said it
doesn't take a village, a collective, the state, which he said
has made mistakes in raising children, it takes a family. Is this
something that is going to become a major issue in this fall
campaign?"<p>

    -- "Also in San Diego, former president George Bush told the
delegates he `worked hard,' I'm quoting here, `to uphold the
dignity and the honor of the presidency, to treat it with
respect. And then he added, quote, `it breaks his heart, when the
White House is demeaned, the presidency diminished.' Does that
hurt coming from your immediate predecessor?"<p>

    -- "He then went on, Mrs. Clinton, he made a point of saying
that his wife, Mrs. Bush, quote, `unquestionably upheld the honor
of the White House.' Is that an insult to you?"<p>

    -- When Mrs. Clinton failed to answer sharply enough,
Woodruff insisted: "But he was clearly drawing a contrast
there...you're not hurt?"<p>

    Stories of Mrs. Clinton's rough-house approach to politics,
such as her reported role in firing and lodging criminal
accusations against seven workers of the White House Travel
Office, did not prevent CBS This Morning co-host Jose Diaz-Balart
from also presenting the First Lady as the beleaguered martyr of
unfortunate Republican attacks: <p>

    -- "In the San Diego Republican convention, you were the
subject of much conversation, and I think the target, I think
many would say, of some very serious attacks."<p>
 "Do you ever, seriously, in the White
House, when all the doors are closed, do you ever say `Is this
worth it'?"<p>

    Diaz-Balart also asked the First Lady two welfare questions
from the left: <p>

    -- "One thing you care very deeply about is children, and
even your supporters that work for children's rights have
criticized President Clinton's decision to okay the welfare
reform bill. What were your conversations with him when he was in
that period of really making a determination?"<p>

    -- "What would you say to the people in the Children's
Defense Fund [the liberal group she used to chair] who have
criticized it? What is your response to them?"<p>

    Woodruff also peppered the First Lady with welfare reform
questions, all six of them from the left. Here are three, another
is the quote of the day.<p>

    -- "Your close friend, Marian Wright Edelman of the
Children's Defense Fund, said the President's signing and this is
a quote, 'makes a mockery of his pledge not to hurt children,'
she said, 'it will leave a moral blot on his presidency and the
country that will never be forgotten.'"<p>

    -- "But if the bill is so flawed, why sign it? Why not work
to fix it, and sign it later?"<p>

    -- "Eleanor Roosevelt, whom you admire, mentioned her again
just now, said that much of the time she kept her disagreements
with the President to herself in private, but there were times
that she felt it was important to disagree publicly. Does there
ever come a time with you, and if not welfare reform, then what?" <p>


<center><h2><a name="networks">Democrats and Clinton Have Gone Too Far to the Right?
Networks Worry Democrats Not Liberal Enough</a></center></h2><p>

    Last night network correspondents worried how wise it has
been for Bill Clinton and the Democratic Party to have moved to
the right and, in so doing, abandoned their liberal princples.
Tom Brokaw placed the party, which fought Republican efforts to
slow the rate of growth of government, to the right of center.<p>

    -- During PBS-NBC coverage, Margaret Warner asked Andrew
Kohut of the Pew Research Center: "Does the President pay any
political price for turning his back on traditional liberalism,
that is, among enthusiasm among traditional Democrats?"<p>

    -- Later during NBC's solo time, Tom Brokaw interviewed VP Al
Gore and then observed to NBC's Tim Russert: "The Vice President
was saying no no no, this is not forced on us by the Republicans,
we really always had this kind of thing in mind in the first
place. But since 1994 they have slid across the political
spectrum to really right of center. And they've got a guy by the
name of Dick Morris who's advising them on a daily basis how to
be more pragmatic."<p>

    -- On CBS, Dan Rather asked Jesse Jackson: "Bill Clinton's
been running pretty hard to the right, so far that some Democrats
now call him a `Republicrat.' Do you go that far?" <p>

    -- Talking to Tom Hayden, Ed Bradley of CBS wondered:
"Senator Hayden, there are people who say the Democratic Party
has become very pragmatic in an effort to win this election,
they've given up their principles. Your response to that?" <p>


<center><h2><a name="For">For</a> Second Day, Focus is on Evils of Welfare Reform
"Slightly Terrified" of New Democrat Promises</h2></center><p>

    Just as on Sunday, last night the networks repeatedly pressed
Democrats from the left on Bill Clinton's signing of the welfare
reform bill. A PBS reporter wondered if it meant the dismantling
of the "safety net that took so long to put together."<p>

    -- CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked Illinois Senator Carol
Moseley-Braun: "How does it feel, tell us, you voted against the
welfare reform bill, you're now obviously very supportive of the
President, tell us do you feel that he sort of betrayed some of
those values that you expressed. How can you go forward now and
support him after his decision to sign that welfare reform bill
into law?"<p>

    -- HHS Secretary Donna Shalala got it from the left during
PBS-NBC coverage as Tom Brokaw inquired: "If you were a poor
single mother in a poor rural state in America, without many
resources, and you wanted to go to work, you want to do all the
right things, but there aren't many jobs for people who have real
skills, wouldn't you be slightly terrified looking into the next
two years?"<p>

    -- Earlier in the evening, Elizabeth Farnesworth of PBS
grilled White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes: "We're
looking tonight at this whole question of who the Democrats are.
Did the President turn his back on fundamental Democratic
principles when he signed the welfare bill?" She also forwarded a
liberal argument: "Does it worry you that the welfare, signing
the welfare bill is unraveling the safety net that took so long
to put together?"<p>

    -- ABC's Jeff Greenfield highlighted bewilderment in network
ranks about the acceptance of Clinton's retreat from liberalism
on the issue. Interviewing Congressman Charles Rangel, he asked:
"Congressman it used to be said that when the Democrats make a
firing squad they form a circle, they love to rebel against an
incumbent President, and you have the welfare bill and the move
to the center. You're from one of the most liberal cities in the
country, why is the dog not barking in the night? Why are you
staying with the President given that discontent?" <p>

<center><h2><a name="sidebites">SIDEBITES</a></h2></center><p>

<h3>Harsh or Enthusiastic?</h3><p>

    Bill Clinton and Bob Dole attacked each other on Sunday, but
for CBS This Morning, only Bob Dole was harsh. Sandra Hughes
reported Monday: "Dole's big moment yesterday came when he
stormed Chicago, and launch-ed a harsh attack against the man of
the hour there, Bill Clinton." <p>

    But a few minutes earlier Bill Plante reviewed Clinton's
train trip, admiringly noting that "at each whistle stop Mr.
Clinton threw himself enthusiastically into campaign mode,
leaning deep into every crowd and lacing his remarks with
partisan fire." <p>

    So are the Democratic candidates avoiding harsh personal
attacks? On Good Morning America co-host Charlie Gibson asked
Senator Christopher Dodd: "You said the other day that `I got the
word out,' that I don't want to hear personal attacks against the
Republicans at this convention. Yesterday on his train trip the
President accused Republicans of blackmail to get their budget.
Al Gore, yesterday, accused the Republicans of ignorance and
audacity, talked about the two-headed monster of Dole and
Gingrich. Dick Gephardt, the leader of the House, of the
Democrats, talked about Republican extremism, said they're
radicals. Talk about getting the word out?"<p>


<h3>Gumbel's Gripe</h3><p>

    Monday Bryant Gumbel couldn't stop from taking one more shot
at Republicans for an image he helped create. Interviewing
Chicago Mayor Richard Daley on Today, he queried: "The
Republicans, as you know, took a lot of criticism for the
scripting of their convention and for presenting an image that
was contrary to their platform. How do you figure this convention
is going to be different?"<p>
<h3>Ignoring Casey's Case</h3><p>

    Former Pennsylvania Gov. Bob Casey, banned from the
Democratic convention podium for the second party gathering in a
row, gave an impassioned pro-life speech yesterday at Chicago's
Fischer Center. Despite a reported heavy media presence at his
speech (which he wanted to make at the convention), none of the
networks aired the Casey speech story on last night's evening
news shows. <p>

    In his new book Fighting For Life, Casey remembered the 1992
platform hearings: "There were many Democrats, I said, who
opposed our party's embrace of the radical pro-abortion lobby.
Often it seemed the Democratic National Committee had become
little more than an auxiliary of NARAL -- the National Abortion
Rights Action League."<p>

    On Monday's Nightline, ABC's Chris Bury gave Casey 15 seconds
of fame: "The Democrats in Chicago, like the Republicans in San
Diego, have tried to script any spontaneity right out of the
program. Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey, whose strong
anti-abortion views defy the party's position, had to find
cameras outside the convention hall."<p>


<h3>At Hillary's Side</h3><p>

    As a CBS camera panned the United Center last night it came
upon a man standing beside Hillary Rodham Clinton. Dan Rather
identified him: "The gentleman in the dark suit to the right of
the frame, who was just framed out, Les Moonves of CBS. And the
chant takes up `four more years.' The lady, the First Lady from
Chicago with the smashing smile, is age 48. She and President
Clinton have been married for 20 years." Moonves's job with CBS?
President of the entertainment division.<p>

<i>"You said this morning that the party's message will focus on the
needs and cares of the people. Now, how do you reconcile that
with a President who has just signed a quote 'welfare reform
bill' which by general agreement is going to put a lot of poor
children on the street?"<p>
-- Dan Rather to Chris Dodd during an
interview on the August 25 CBS Evening News</i><p>


<center><h2><a name="Weekend">Weekend</a> Shows Fail to Apply GOP Level of Scrutiny
Democrats Not Portrayed as Intolerant, Extreme</h2></center><p>

    Unlike Republicans two Sundays ago, Democrats yesterday did
not come under assault from the networks over their intolerance
on abortion. While the subject was raised a few times, the
networks spent more time raising liberal criticisms of the
welfare reform bill President Clinton just signed. Findings from
weekend coverage:<p>

    -- Democrats faced about one-third as many questions about
abortion and the exclusion of dissenting speakers. Two weeks ago,
the Sunday morning shows asked 27 questions about the GOP split
on abortion and the failure to allow Gov. Pete Wilson to speak.
Interviewers asked only 10 questions yesterday, perhaps because
unlike inviting pro-choice Wilson and pro-life Bay Buchanan weeks
before, pro-life Democrats like Gov. Bob Casey were not booked,
despite Casey's Friday Wall Street Journal op-ed attacking the
"intolerance" of a "gag rule party." CNN's Late Edition asked
only two questions, compared to 11 posed to the GOP; NBC's Meet
the Press asked six questions, compared to nine for the GOP.
ABC's This Week with David Brinkley had two questions instead of
four, and CBS's Face the Nation offered zero abortion questions,
compared to three in San Diego.<p>
 
    -- No mention of corporate contributions to the Democratic
convention, not even of the hypocrisy of accepting funds from
tobacco companies while Clinton attacks them with rhetoric and
new regulations. Two weeks ago on Meet the Press, David Broder
twice asked RNC Chairman Haley Barbour about the hypocrisy of
accepting corporate money for the convention while promising
campaign finance reform. On the Friday, August 23 World News
Tonight, however, ABC's Brian Ross did do a story on the top ten
corporate contributors to the DNC, including "a labor union under
federal investigation for its ties to the mafia."<p>

    -- No questions were posed about how unions have taken over
the Democratic Party. A Washington Post survey of Democratic
delegates found 34 percent belong to a union. Friday's Wall
Street Journal noted that "more than 400 delegates -- roughly one
in ten -- will be members of the National Education Association."
But that failed to generate questions about who controls the
party. <p>

    Only 21 percent of GOP delegates said they were part of the
religious right, but in San Diego CBS worried about their having
too much influence. On Sunday August 11, Face the Nation guests
got five ominous questions. "There are a number of Republicans
who are very uncomfortable with what they feel is the power, the
control that the conservative religious right has. Are you
concerned about that?" CBS reporter Phil Jones asked Texas
Governor George W. Bush.<p>

    -- Democrats called too conservative, charged from the left
with going too far on welfare reform.



<center><h2><a name="Just">Just</a> as in San Diego, Networks Attack from the Left
Network Stars Line Up for Welfare Status Quo</center></h2><p>

    The networks came at Republicans from the left on abortion in
San Diego, and on Sunday they also came at Democrats from the
left. By concentrating on liberal complaints about welfare
reform, reporters helped Bill Clinton's effort to portray himself
as a centrist. Dan Rather wondered if the party had gone "too far
to the right?"<p>

    -- Al Hunt of the Wall Street Journal set the tone of liberal
anger on Saturday night's CNN Capital Gang: "Jesse Jackson and a
few others will complain and I think a majority of the delegates
here privately agree with Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan that
supporters of this bill, quote, 'will take this disgrace to their
graves,' end quote. They know Bill Clinton put his own political
interests ahead of the well being of little children." <p>

    --  Meet the Press moderator Tim Russert demanded of DNC
General Chairman Chris Dodd: "It's an issue of morality to many
people, and how can you defend a President who basically said to
the Congressional Democrats: Listen, that's your view, but I'm
doing this, because -- was it politically expedient?"<p>

    -- Talking with Democratic strategist James Carville later in
the show, Russert reminded viewers that he once toiled for former
New York Governor Mario Cuomo: "But the Democratic Party for
sixty years, James Carville, fought for a minimum guarantee
payment to poor children and Bill Clinton undid that. Don't you
have to draw the line someplace and say 'I'm a Democrat and this
is what I stand for'?"<p>

    -- On yesterday's Face the Nation, CBS reporter Rita Braver
asked Chicago Mayor Richard Daley: "The party looks a lot more
united right now. But we have a sense that there are some
underlying divisions and particularly this week with the
President signing a welfare bill that a lot of people think is
going to put children into poverty. And I guess the question is
that in a city like this, aren't you scared about what is going
to happen? Aren't you afraid you are going to have a lot of
hungry children?"<p>

    -- Minutes later while interviewing Indiana Governor Evan
Bayh, Braver pictured the Democrats as being too conservative: "I
just wondered what you think is the really big difference between
the Democrats and Republicans in this election? What would make
people go Democrat when it seems like the Democrats are moving so
close to Republican positions?"<p>

    --  Last night Dan Rather joined the chorus, inquiring of
Braver on the CBS Evening News: "Rita, how worried are the
Democrats about protests from some here that the party is running
too far to the right, particularly on welfare reform?"  <p>

<center><h2><a name="Benchmarks">Benchmarks for the Week to Come:</a>
A Look Back at San Diego</center></h2><p>

    Before the networks begin their prime time coverage in
Chicago, here's a brief summary of how they covered the
Republican convention in San Diego. <p>

    -- Labeling. Republican delegates, speakers, and candidates
were described as conservative more than three times as often as
moderate, but reporters also used more extreme labels than
moderate labels. The networks employed 46 conservative labels
(including 16 references to extreme conservatism) to only 13
moderate labels.<p>

    -- Agenda of Questions. Reporters posed more than seven times
as many questions from the liberal agenda as they did from a
conservative agenda: 51 questions from the left, compared to only
six questions from the right.<p>

    -- Controversies. Reporters referred to the Republican
Party's split on the abortion issue, including Gov. Pete Wilson's
"disinvitation" to speak, on 55 occasions in prime time. In 1992,
the Democrats' spiking of Gov. Bob Casey surfaced only six times
(once on NBC, five times on CNN). ABC and CBS never acknowledged
the Casey flap.<p>


<center><h2><a name="Sidebites">SIDEBITES</a></center></h2><p>

<h3>Unpopular Koppel</h3><p>

Most people think Ted Koppel was wrong to leave the Republican
convention early, a Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll found. On
yesterday's Fox News Sunday, host Tony Snow reported that when
asked if Koppel was "justified in leaving," 52 percent said no,
31 percent responded yes and 16 percent were undecided. On
Tuesday of the GOP gathering, Koppel announced Nightline would
leave because "this convention is more infomercial than a news
event." <p>


<h3>Moderate" Democrats?</h3><p>

"Return to Chicago: This Time, the Democrats Embrace Moderation"
declared the headline on the front of the Sunday Washington
Post's convention section. Four pages later the Post headline
over a story on a survey of delegates read: "Delegates Leaning
More Liberal Than Their Leader or the Rank and File." Indeed, 82
percent favor affirmative action, 65 percent are against a
balanced budget amendment, 72 percent oppose "reducing spending
on social programs," but 65 percent want less defense spending.<p>


<h3>Hillary the Revolutionary</h3><p>

Sam Donaldson identified Hillary Clinton's problem on yesterday's
This Week with David Brinkley: "I think much of the opposition to
Hillary Rodham Clinton is the fact that she is a strong-willed
woman doing things in a man's arena, and we men don't seem to
like that." <p>
After George Will pointed out that politics is the arena of many
women, from Margaret Thatcher to Indira Gandhi, Cokie Roberts
retorted that she's been an "agent of change" and "it's very
difficult for the world to accept people who have been
revolutionaries."<p>

    <h2><center>Three items today:<p></center></h2>

1) The Republican Party has been "captured by the extremists" and
"Don't you get mad" when the First Lady is criticized, just two
of Dan Rather's statements and questions to Bill Clinton for 60
Minutes on Sunday night.<p>
2) For a former Washington Post reporter the Republican
convention reminded her of slaughtered Indians and of Reagan's
mean policies.<p>
3) Just about everyone in Hollywood showed up at or served as
host for President Clinton's 50th birthday bash Sunday night. One
major celebrity shouted that "Dole sucks!"<p>

 1) Sunday afternoon Dan Rather interviewed President Clinton
for that night's 60 Minutes. Dan Rather started out by asking:
"Some of your staff members, not by name, have been saying, 'yes
the President thinks Bob Dole is a nice person and has been a
pretty good leader in some ways, but, say they, he's been
captured by the extremists in the Republican Party, the radical
part of the Republican Party, including Newt Gingrich. Is that
what you think?"<p>

    Rather showed Clinton video of criticisms from Bob Dole and
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison at the Republican convention. Almost
apologetic, Rather noted, "You said your hope is it can be fought
out on the issues, but one more thing from the convention, then
I'll give you a chance to respond to it. As you must know,
whether you watched the convention or not, the Republicans fired
a number of shots at the First Lady. Some samples. Former
President Bush said, quote, 'Mrs. Bush upheld the honor of the
White House, and did it with class and style and caring and
love.'....I don't know of anyone in the convention who didn't
take that as a difference of the present First Lady and the
former First Lady."<p>
    
    After Clinton responded, Rather implored: "Don't you get mad,
Mr. President, when this sort of thing happens?"<p>

     2) And before you forget the media's animosity toward the
Republican convention, here's a portion of a commentary piece in
Friday's USA Today by Jill Nelson, a former Washington Post
reporter: <p>
    "I found it hard not to cringe. I was embarrassed by the
specter of everyone's favorite black man, Colin Powell, lecturing
us on why he became a Republican and referring to a  divine
providence that gave us this land.' Tell that to the Native
Americans who were slaughtered in the name of 'divine
providence.' I felt manipulated, not moved, by Nancy Reagan's
tribute to her Ronnie as some sort of caring everyman,
considering that under Reagan the rich got richer, the national
debt skyrocketed, and working Americans were left holding the
bag."<p>

    3 ) Sunday night the Democratic Party held a series of
birthday parties in New York City and around the country for
President Clinton. The Washington Post's Lloyd Grove reported
Monday that in addition to emcee Whoopi Goldberg that attending
celebrities included Tony Bennett, Carly Simon, Jon Bon Jovi,
Aretha Franklin, and James Earl Jones. <p>

    Monday's New York Post added these names to the celebrity
list: Leslie Nielsen, Tim Conway, Ted Danson and Mary
Steenburgen. The New York Post's Cindy Adams reported: "The party
was beamed around the country by satellite so other celebs could
get a chance to host a shindig of their very own: In L.A.,
Nicolas Cage and his wife, Patricia Arquette, played host. In San
Francisco it was Michael Keaton, who has never, ever done
anything political before. In Baltimore, it was Valerie Harper;
in Boston, Judy Collins; in Nashville, L.L. Cool J; in Denver,
C.C. Wayans...."<p>
 
    The Washington Post's Grove relayed that at one of the NYC
bashes, "Comedian and morning television host Rosie O'Donnell
entertained the crowd by shouting, 'Dole sucks!'"<p>

    A very inclusionary and tolerant message. -- Brent Baker.<p>

<center><h2>Quote of the Day</h2><p></center>

<i>"Just how tightly scripted is this convention? Well, a Russian 
television reporter said today that this is as tightly controlled 
as anything the Communist Party ever put on, Tom." <p>
-- Reporter 
David Bloom from the convention floor to anchor Tom Brokaw, 
August 14 NBC Nightly News.</i><p>
<center><h2><a name="finally">Finally Find a Republican They Like, But Still Attack 
Rest Elizabeth Dole: "Masterful"</h2></center><p>

It took until the third night, but Wednesday evening the networks 
finally found a Republican they could respect: Elizabeth Dole. 
However, they still spent yesterday morning and evening 
disparaging speakers who had criticized President Clinton and 
questioning the credibility of Jack Kemp for changing his 
position on affirmative action and immigration.<p>

"Absolutely powerful performance," gushed Dan Rather after 
Elizabeth Dole finished her reflections on Bob Doles life. "It 
was masterful," agreed Tim Russert on NBC where Tom Brokaw 
explained: "In the language of this summer, ladies and gentlemen, 
that was a gold medal performance." ABCs Peter Jennings 
pronounced it "an unquestionably brilliant piece of stagecraft by 
Mrs. Dole."<p>

Yesterday, network viewers also heard:<p>

Jack Kemp has "damaged his credibility" by altering his positions 
on affirmative action and immigration. Lesley Stahl asked if he's 
selling his soul to be loyal to Bob Dole?" ABC suggested it 
fights the very image that hes built for himself as an 
independent thinker." Kemp adjusted two views, all of Clintons 
are usually in constant motion. Will networks focus on that in 
Chicago? <p>

Networks come to Clintons defense and say Tuesday night speakers 
went too far in their harsh criticism of Clinton. CBS insisted 
Susan Molinari went after Clinton "with a vengeance" and Good 
Morning America's Elizabeth Vargas claimed "some of the harshest 
words were from Texas Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison." Bryant 
Gumbel wondered if anyone is "seeing any evidence" of tolerance 
from Republicans. And NBCs Maria Shriver asked "how ugly" 
Republicans will make the fall campaign. <p>

Reporters may like Elizabeth Dole, but they still hold a grudge 
against Marilyn Quayle. ABCs Michel McQueen recalled the 
"strident tone" of her 1992 convention address as NBCs Tom 
Brokaw also charged last night that Mrs. Quayle was "too 
strident." <p>

<center><h2><a name="gop">GOP</a> Criticized for Attacking Clinton*s "Eating Habits";
Decrying "Bash Bill Night"</h2></center><p>
Journalistic sensitivity to any attacks on Bill Clinton quickly came through loud and clear Wednesday morning and night. "GOP Unleashes An Attack On Clinton Over Character and His Economic Policies," charged The New York Times.<p>

"Congresswoman Susan Molinari took on the role of attack dog last night, using her keynote address to attack the President," Bryant Gumbel began Wednesday's Today.<p>

NBC*s morning crew stuck to the Democratic line in their questions. Gumbel asked Tim Russert: "There's an old adage that says what you do speaks so loudly I can't hear what you say. Republicans are speaking tolerance and diversity. Are you seeing any evidence of it or quite the contrary?"<p>

Today's Katie Couric inquired of Republican Charles Black: "Chris Dodd of the DNC says this is a huge con game. That the way you're portraying the party as this moderate inclusive party just doesn't gibe with say, the platform, and some of the attitudes of members of the GOP. How do you address that?" Couric asked Pat Buchanan: "Your speech at the 1992 Republican convention, where you talked about a religious war, was considered by many to be very polarizing, a real turn-off, self-righteous, superior, exclusionary. Do you regret giving this speech?"<p>

CBS This Morning co-host Jane Robelot declared: "It was unofficially Bash Bill Night last night in San Diego...Speaker after Republican speaker went after the man with a vengeance, including the keynoter, Susan Molinari."<p>

Over on Good Morning America, news anchor Elizabeth Vargas asserted: "Some of the harshest words were from Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, who tried to paint the President as a tax and spend liberal." GMA co-host Charles Gibson added: "Polls will tell you these days that people do not want much partisanship in their politics, but they got it at the Republican convention last night. There were attacks on President Clinton's credibility, integrity, even his eating habits." ABC's Vargas didn't shy away from stereotyping: "But in addition to a gender gap, Republicans have had problems attacting minorities, a party that has traditionally been home to the angry white man."<p>

Last night NBC*s Lisa Myers demanded of Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison: "Some of the focus groups which had watched your speech...voters found it too negative. They didn't particularly like the degree to which you attacked the President. In retrospect do you think you went too far?"<p>

Calling conservatives "extremists" has been a Democratic mantra for two years, but NBC*s Maria Shriver asked Dole California campaign chairman Ken Khachigian: "You said coming out of this campaign, Clinton is going to have 80 days of hell, that we are going to take Clinton down in California, that we are going to take him down hard. How ugly is this going to get?" No uglier than the media in San Diego.<p>

<center><h2><a name="clinton">Will</a> Clinton Be Held to the Same Standard in Chicago?</h2>
<h3>Jack Kemp, the Political "Acrobat"</h3></center><p>

The choice of Jack Kemp as Dole's running mate prompted the media to point out Kemp's "independent thinking," his differences with Dole on issues like affirmative action and immigration. Now that Kemp has modified those two views to reflect the party's platform, the media are accusing him of abandoning principle.<p>

While reporters portray President Clinton's flip-flops on every issue as "moving to the center," they don't see moves from Dole and Kemp in quite the same light. On Wednesday's CBS Evening News, anchor Dan Rather quipped: "Bob Dole has reversed himself on deficit reduction versus tax cuts. Jack Kemp has reversed himself on how he feels about immigration. Isn't that, or is it, going to make it more difficult to 
attack Bill Clinton on the character issue?" Questioning Vin Weber, co-chairman of the Dole campaign, in prime time last night CBS's Lesley Stahl asked: "Your longtime friend Jack Kemp has changed his long-held views, in the last two days, on affirmative action, on immigration policy. Is he selling his soul to be loyal to Bob Dole?"<p>

Interviewing Dan Quayle, NBC's Maria Shriver kept up the same line: "Let's talk about Jack Kemp [for] a minute. Today he reversed his position on immigration. Now in favor of expelling children of illegal immigrants from schools. How much does that damage his credibility?"<p>

On World News Tonight ABC's Jackie Judd asserted that "The quarterback became the acrobat today. Kemp was flip-flopping on long held positions." She then looked at his affirmative action change, noting "that left at least one delegate here feeling abandoned." She concluded: "Kemp's change in position on these core issues fights the very image that he's built for himself as an independent thinker."<p>

<center><h2><a name="cheese">Want</a> Some Cheese With Your Whine? </h2>
<h3>Koppel Cops Out of San Diego</h3></center>

Ted Koppel is angry. As quoted by Martha Moore in the August 14 USA Today, he complained that convention planners always exert as much control over coverage as possible, but this year, "`I think the politicians are ahead,'" says ABC's Ted Koppel, who took his Nightline show back to Washington today, two days early. `They have more control over what we put on the air this week than they have ever had before.'"<p>

Just how successful have planners been? According to USA Today ABC filled a bit over half of their broadcast on Monday, 34 minutes out of an hour, with actual convention proceedings. On Tuesday, ABC aired even less of the convention, 26 out of 66 minutes broadcast. ABC filled the rest with interviews, analysis and ads.<p>

Koppel sounded like a restless child in his Tuesday Nightline announcement: "This convention is more of an infomercial than a news event. Nothing surprising has happened, nothing surprising is anticipated. Frankly, we expect the Democratic convention in Chicago to be much of the same. Indeed the only reason we were planning to originate these Nightline broadcasts from Chicago in another couple of week was a sense of fairness. And then it occurred to us that perhaps we should learn from our experience. There was a time when the national political conventions were news events of such complexity that they required the presence of thousands of journalists , but not this year. If anything important happens we will certainly have an adequate staff here to cover it and we will send an equivalent unit to Chicago. But we don*t all have to be here so most of us from Nightline are going home tomorrow."<p>

Such is the sad state of American journalism: Koppel's Nightline broadcast five stories about Tonya Harding in 1994, many more about O.J. Simpson, but will only turn in two on the 1996 Republican convention."<p>

Reporters couldn't help but praise Elizabeth Dole, but Marilyn Quayle 
still hasn't lived down the media's feminist fury over her 1992 convention 
speech. On Tuesday night, ABC's Michel McQueen said: "I ran into Marilyn 
Quayle today, who gave a speech in 1992 that was kind of a 'peel the 
paint off the walls' speech that was described later on as contributing 
to a rather strident tone of the '92 convention. She told me she was 
shocked by the way it was received afterwards."<p>

After Dan Quayle's speech last night, NBC's Tom Brokaw recalled: "Marilyn 
Quayle, who spoke at the convention four years ago, and many people 
thought that her speech was too strident, talking about the place 
of women, critical of the feminist movement in this country at the 
time."<p>



<center><h2><a name="rapping">Rapping</a> Reagan's Film</h2></center>
<p>
Remember Bill Clinton's "Man From Hope" video during the 1992 Democratic convention? The sugary-sweet film was shown on all the networks and was widely praised for adding insight into Bill Clinton. But the Republican*s equally sweet video of President Ronald Reagan on Tuesday night touched off a round of media carping as to the video*s value as news.
<p>
As James Bennet reported in Wednesday*s New York Times, Jeff Zucker, Executive Producer of NBC coverage, said: "Let me say if I had to do it again, I would really give that a second thought...I*m not as convinced, Monday morning quarterbacking myself, that it was as newsworthy as I thought going in."
<p>
CBS officials clucked about their decision to pass over the video, hoping for more of a movie of the week flavor. "Lane Venardos, a CBS vice president, sounded equally comfortable with his decision to ignore the film almost completely. "We decided on news value alone not to run it," he said. "There was not one scintilla of new information." Mr. Venardos said convention planners had promised the video would include "new pictures of the former President, never-before-seen post-Alzheimer's-onset pictures."
<p>
<h3>Clinton: Fiscal Conservative</h3>
<p>
In the August 19 edition, Newsweek's six-million-dollar "anonymous" author, Joe Klein, declared the GOP faithful "entered their convention on a mild, quasi-delusional wave of enthusiasm. The rest of us will be forgiven for yawning: the Dole tax cut stands, to all but hard-core taxophobes, as a transparent and rather pathetic bit of politics. He wants to cut $548 billion over six years? And balance the budget? Does anyone actually believe this? The trouble is, after all the deficit reduction of the past few years, there isn*t much non-incendiary matter left on the federal level to cut."
<p>
Time's George Church sneered: "Getting people not to think might be helpful, particularly since some of Dole's numbers do not seem to add up." Church concluded: "A case could be made that the candidate who best represents the fiscally conservative, moderate Republican tradition is, believe it or not, Bill Clinton."
<p>
<h3>Candace Capitalizes</h3>
<p>
On Wednesday's Today, NBC's Jamie Gangel did a feature on  Candace Gingrich which painted a very unsympathetic portrait of the lesbian*s half-brother Newt: "Gingrich went on to call Candace a sinner. He's also compared homosexuality to alcoholism and is against legislation that would protect gays from being fired because of their sexual orientation." 
<p>
Gangel said to Candace: "You're being very polite about the fact that your brother says terrible things about homosexuals....He doesn't return your phone calls. He doesn't answer your faxes. He doesn't respond to his own sister. That's okay with you?"
<p>
Gangel never attempted to understand how the Speaker might feel: that Candace has capitalized on her half-brother's fame (complete with a guest star appearance on Friends by making him look insensitive, and that replying to any call or fax might lead to another batch of negative publicity.
Gangel simply claimed: "Candace says she is not trying to hurt her brother. She just wants equal rights and hopes people will learn to accept gay relationships."
<p>
<h3>Kemp's flip flops.</h3>
<p>
	When Bob Dole announced his choice of Jack Kemp as his running mate, the media quickly pointed out Kemp's "independent thinking," his differences with Dole on issues like affirmative action and immigration. Now that Kemp has modified his views to reflect those of the party platform, the media is accusing him of flip-flopping.
<p>
	On CNN's coverage of the convention, political analyst Ken Bode was quick to attack Kemp: "Today Jack Kemp did a double back dive ten degree of difficulty on the issues of immigration and affirmative action." Questioning Vin Weber, co-chairman of the Dole campaign, CBS' Lesley Stahl asked: "Your longtime friend Jack Kemp has changed his long-held views, in the last two days, on affirmative action, on immigration policy. Is he selling his soul to be loyal to Bob Dole."
<p>
	While reporters consider President Clinton's flip-flops "moving to the center," they don*t see moves from Dole and Kemp in quite the same light. On the August 14 CBS Evening News, anchor Dan Rather quipped: "Bob Dole has reversed himself on deficit reduction versus tax cuts. Jack Kemp has reversed himself on how he feels about immigration. Isn*t that, or is it, going to make it more difficult to attack Bill Clinton on the character issue?" Interviewing Dan Quayle, NBC's Maria Shriver kept up the same line: "Let's talk about Jack Kemp [for] a minute. Today he reversed his position on immigration. Now in favor of expelling children of illegal immigrants from schools. How much does that damage his credibility."
<p>
	The questions were no different on the floor of the convention. On the August 14 World News Tonight, ABC's Jackie Judd got her angle from a liberal California delegate, claiming Kemp had "abandoned" that wing of the party. She started her story: "The quarterback became the acrobat today. Kemp was flip-flopping on long held positions to get in line with Bob Dole." It's not so unusual for a vice-presidential candidate to accommodate the views of the presidential candidate, but Kemp's change in position on these core issues fights the very image that he*s built for himself as an independent thinker."
 
<center><h2><a name="media">Media</a> Salesmanship at the 1992 Democratic Convention
</h2></center>
<h3>Speaking of Infomercials...</h3>
<p>
As network stars grumble about the tightly scripted "infomercial" the GOP convention has become, perhaps they should remember the infomercial-like tone some reporters employed to promote the Clinton-Gore ticket at their New York City convention in 1992:
ABC*s Jim Wooten introduced the convention on July 13, 1992: "That*s the ticket. Not a liberal in sight and that*s the picture Clinton wants the convention to leave with the country. Democrats happily moving from their liberal past to their centrist future...So Clinton and his moderates have captured the Democratic Party for the moment."
<p>
In the next morning's New York Times, reporter David Rosenbaum echoed ABC: "The views that dominated the party for so long, what was proudly called liberal, are hardly in evidence in Madison Square Garden this week...Mr. Mondale, who in 1984 was the last down-the-line liberal to win the Democratic presidential nomination and who lost 49 states to Ronald Reagan in November, said he was resigned to the change."
<p>
On the evening of July 14, 1992 Dan Rather announced: "Delegates approved the Clinton-Gore center-of-the-road Democratic Party platform, trying to move the party closer to the voters around the malls in America*s suburbs."
<p>
CBS This Morning reporter Bill Plante touted Clinton's momentum: "Everything seems to be going Clinton's way. They couldn't be happier here. They say that the candidate*s numbers are improving every day. They have their moderate platform. And things are just generally where they would want them to be."
<p>
Peter Jennings claimed on July 15, 1992: "He's become a little more disciplined, Bill Clinton, but you know he loves a crowd. And he has, don*t want to get carried away here, but he has the kind of hands people respond to."
<p>
From the floor of the convention NBC's Maria Shriver merely tried to get Elizabeth Glaser to repeat her nasty attack on Ronald Reagan: "You place responsibility for the death of your daughter [from AIDS] squarely at the feet of the Reagan administration. Do you believe they are responsible for that?"
<p>
Before savaging Barbara Bush in August, then-PBS anchor Judy Woodruff asked Hillary Clinton: "The Clinton campaign has been saying that this is a week that they were trying to tell the American people more about who Bill Clinton really is...What is it that you think the American people should know about your husband that they may not know or may not understand?"<p>

<center><h2><a name="women">Women</a> Naturally Scared by Republican Policies</h2> 
<h3>Morning Lectures on Tolerance</h3> </center><p>
 
Supposed GOP intolerance and how Republican policies scare women  
dominated interviews on Tuesday's Today and Good Morning  
America.<p> 
 
Talking to Susan Molinari, Christine Todd Whittman and  Kay  
Bailey Hutchison, GMA's Charlie Gibson laid out why women are  
turned off by Republicans: "It was the Republican Party that did  
take the lead on ending federal welfare payments as they have  
been traditionally paid over the last 50 to 60 years and the  
prime beneficiaries of that are women. It is the Republican Party  
that took the lead on reducing the rate of growth in Medicare and  
Medicaid. It is the Republican Party now that is trying to make  
an issue of denying education and benefits to the children of  
illegal immigrants. It is the Republican Party that has rejected  
in the last week or so, tolerance language on abortion in the  
platform."<p> 
 
Then he asked: "There was an attempt by some in the platform  
hearings to get language included in the platform that simply  
asked for toleration of dissenting views particularly on  
abortion. It was language that Bob Dole wanted in the platform.  
The party rejected him, it rejected your views, all three of you  
in this, is this a tolerant party, do you feel comfortable in it  
with its position on tolerance?"<p> 
 
Quizzing Colin Powell on Today, Katie Couric queried: "Does the  
party platform trouble you? Does the fact that that some of these  
governors opted not to speak because they were told they could  
not discuss their views on abortion, do all those things make you  
basically doubt that this is a big tent here?"<p> 
 
Tom Brokaw wondered: "Gen. Powell, the difference between having  
a position in your heart and campaigning on something as Jack  
Kemp now is going to be forced to do, is going to say to a lot of  
black Americans and a lot of people who feel that they are denied  
full access to the privilege of being a citizen in this country,  
`thats just utter hypocrisy. What is there in this platform or  
in this party tonight that says to the rest of the African- 
Americans out there, come on in, theres a place for you?"<p> 

<center><h2><a name="reporters">Reporters</a> Stick to "Extremist" Labels on Republicans  
</h2> 
<h3>Media Echoes of Clinton Consultants</h3></center> <p>
 
Using the description extreme to tar the Republican party did  
not begin in the convention aisles of San Diego, but in the  
sullen liberal reaction to the Republicans electoral sweep in  
1994. Clinton consultant Dick Morris advised his White House  
clients to tag their opponents as extremist while at the same  
time stealing many of their positions. The media echoed the  
Morris strategy. MediaWatch analysts used the Nexis news data  
retrieval system to search for the word extreme within 25 words  
of "Republican" or "Democrat" in the three news magazines (Time,  
Newsweek, and U.S. News & World Report) and USA Today from  
January 1, 1993 to May 31, 1996. <p> 
 
Analysts discovered reporters did not use many extremist labels  
in 1993 and 1994  41  but 26 of those were applied to  
Republicans, compared to ten mentions of dual extremes and only  
five for the Democrats who ruled both ends of Pennsylvania  
Avenue. Liberal moves to insure abortion on demand, gays in the  
military, nationalized health care, and massive tax increases  
werent beyond the media pale.  <p> 
 
But in the first 17 months of GOP control, Republicans were  
described as "extreme" in 123 stories, while only 15 found  
"extremes" on both sides. Just two mentioned "extreme" Democrats.  
In total, these six print outlets employed 149 extreme labels for  
Republicans to just seven for the Democrats.<p> 
 
USA Todays Richard Benedetto exemplified reporting on Republican  
extremism on June 16, 1995: "Democrats are trying to keep a stiff  
upper lip as they continue to oppose `extreme GOP cuts." Many of  
these were attributed to Democrats, but more than 20 came  
directly from reporters, such as Gloria Borgers March 11, 1996  
U.S. News suggestion that "taking on Buchananism would be good  
for Gingrich. Recall that until Buchanan surged, Gingrich was  
Washingtons resident extremist."<p> 
 
U.S. News & World Report reporter Kenneth Walsh claimed on March  
25, 1996: "Clintons feuds with some allies will make it harder  
to label him a liberal extremist, George Bush in 1988 caricatured  
Michael Dukakis." On October 27, 1995, Walsh happily noted:  
"President Clinton, playing Horatius at the bridge against the  
Republican hordes, is finally winning some favorable reviews.  
Democrats are rallying to his side as he defends the poor and  
elderly against GOP `extremism."<p> 
 
The "extreme" pattern also occurred in television coverage of the  
1996 presidential primaries. MediaWatch analysts studied the  
application of labels in primary stories from a week before the  
New Hampshire primary (February 13) to the South Carolina primary  
(March 2). Republicans and their supporters were labeled on 73  
occasions  45 of those extreme labels, almost all applied to  
Pat Buchanan. On February 25, 1996, CBS weekend anchor John  
Roberts asked consultant Joe Klein: "Some call Buchanan an  
extremist. Others call him American as apple pie. What is this  
fellows appeal?" Answered Klein: "He is both. He is an extremist  
and as American as apple pie." Using the same research parameters  
for a similar three-week period during the 1992 Democratic  
primaries, featuring ultraliberals like Tom Harkin and Jerry  
Brown, reporters used no extremist labels and only four  
applications of "liberal," all in the first two days of the study  
period.<p> 
 
In 1995, the networks introduced GOP presidential candidates by  
noting their "extremism." In 40 network stories introducing  
potential Republican challengers to Clinton, network reporters  
used 54 labels, 49 of which were "conservative" or more extreme.  
In fact, 19 labels, or 35 percent of the total, were labels such  
as "right," "far right," "hard right," "hard-line," "extremist,"  
'Republican fringe," and "ultraconservative fringe." On the  
February 24, 1995 CBS Evening News, reporter Linda Douglass  
alleged: "For years, critics have called [Sen. Phil] Gramm an  
extremist. But he argues these days his ideas are in the  
mainstream." In 27 stories introducing the Democratic candidates  
in 1991, none ever used an extreme term like "far left" or  
"ultraliberal."<p> 

<center><h2><a name="bryant">Bryant</a> Gumbel Scolds Delegates for Lack of Inclusion
But NBC Calls GOP-TV Unfair</h2></center> 

To keep "out what officials call the biased liberal media, NBCs 
Bob Faw reported Tuesday morning the RNC launched GOP-TV to 
provide complete convention coverage. Faw asserted: "What GOP TV 
calls unfiltered, doesnt even begin to pay lip service to 
balance or fairness." NBC should know.<p> 

Heres how Bryant Gumbel opened the Tuesday Today: "Good morning. 
Retired general Colin Powell, a new recruit to the GOP cause, 
addressed the delegates in San Diego last night, drawing cheers 
with accounts of why he became a Republican and why hell vote 
for Bob Dole. But although his speech was generally well-
received, the reception was restrained, and there were boos 
whenever Powell steered away from the right. Though they booed 
and also heckled dissent, Republicans claimed the mantle of 
inclusion throughout the first night of their convention. We can 
expect more of the same today, Tuesday, August 13, 1996."
Guess which network scares journalists? Faw reported that 
"Jonathan Alter of Newsweek thinks GOP TV has started something 
deceptive and unwholesome." Alter explained: "It is political 
propaganda, masquarading as news, and thats a problem."<p>

Political propaganda masquerading as news? Sounds like Bryant 
Gumbel.<p>

<center><h2>Republican Officials Grilled by Network Reporters
A <a name="Tax">Tax</a> on Credibility</h2></center>

The credibility of Bob Doles tax cut proposal arose as a topic 
for skeptical questions Tuesday night.<p> 

On PBS, referring to a Concord Coalition official, Margaret 
	Warner inquired of Dole economist John Taylor: "Does Martha 
Phillips have a point that its hard to credibly make the case 
that you can both cut taxes and balance the budget?"<p>

NBCs Maria Shriver asked New Jersey Governor Christie Todd 
Whitman: "Bill Clinton has said that Bob Doles proposal for the 
economy would end up crippling the economy, balloon the deficit. 
Why is he wrong?"<p>

Early in the evening, Tom Brokaw demanded of Virginias George 
Allen: "Governor, are you not at all concerned about what happens 
to the federal deficit, which is a major, major concern for most 
of the delegates at this convention, based on the polling that 
weve done, if Bob Dole is able to put into effect his 15 percent 
tax cut?"<p>

And: "But if you say to your constituents in the state of 
Virginia, Listen, were going to cut it by 15 percent, taxes, but 
I cant touch 60 percent of the budget that were dealing with 
here, and thats the reality thats facing Bob Dole because of 
Medicare and defense spending and other things, do you think that 
we can get home-free here in seven years and balance the 
budget?"<p> 

<center><h2><a name="Hutchison">Hutchison</a> Speech Tagged "Dangerous" by NBC: Republicans Pummeled from the Left </h2></center>

"Tonight they're ready to take on the Clinton record and try to convince 
a lot of undecided voters that this party is more inclusive than its 
reputation," Peter Jennings announced at the start of ABC's convention 
coverage Tuesday night. But the networks wouldn't let the Republicans 
succeed. NBC Nightly News on Tuesday night devoted its "In 
Depth" segment to "a major problem for the GOP, the gender gap, moderate 
women feeling left out."<p>

A few hours later NBC's Tim Russert relayed as accurate the Democratic 
analysis of the address by Texas Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. He 
charged: "Key words: Mean-spirited and extremist. They want to avoid 
those labels. They have thus far after two days and that's why you're 
not going to see Newt Gingrich in prime time tonight. I think the 
speech by Senator Hutchison of Texas is dangerous, Tom, because she 
uses words that could be interpreted by some people as mean."<p>

Before the speech, Dan Rather offered a classic Ratherism: "Senator 
Kay Bailey Hutchison has now come out to the podium. She's expected 
to hit President Clinton, rhetorically, with everything short of a 
tire tube." But for the second night in a row Republicans were 
bombarded with questions and analysis that portrayed them as extreme 
and intolerant of anything outside their "rigid" views.<p>

The networks peppered the Republicans with questions from the liberal agenda. 
While the majority of questions dwelled on poll numbers and tactical gambits, 
interviews in the first two nights of prime-time network coverage 
featured 35 questions and statements from the left, to only four from 
the right. The evening newscasts contained eight liberal questions 
to zero conservative inquiries. One observation from the right last 
night: CNN's Judy Woodruff noting that "as a pro-life delegate said 
to me this morning..'I was interested in what Colin Powell had to 
say last night but I'm wondering when we're going to hear from a pro-liife 
point of view at the podium?'" For liberal questions, see pages 2 
and 3. <p>

Coverage focused on gender gap and intolerance on abortion as 
reporters suggested it's rational for women to not back the GOP. 

<center><h2><a name="Speechless">Speechless</a> Networks</h2></center>

In their "coverage" of the convention last night, none of the 
three broadcast networks gave any live airtime to prime time 
speeches by Reps. John Kasich and J.C. Watts and Gov. Christie 
Whitman. While ABC and CBS did show Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchisons 
speech in its entirety, NBC aired less than 2.5 minutes of it. 
While Hutchison was still speaking, NBC cut to Tim Russert, who 
gave the Democratic "rapid response" to it  even before it was 
over.<p>

Russert quoted the Democrats press release: "Once again the 
Republicans have showed the face of Bob Dole and Newt Gingrichs 
Republican Party through Sen. Hutchisons speech. It is nasty, 
gratuitous attacks against the President of the United States and 
mean-spirited." According to Russert, Hutchison gave the 
Democrats "what they wanted in order to respond in this way. 
Viewers just had to take his word for it.<p>

<h3>Summary or Pillory?</h3>

Tuesdays New York Times "convention summary" trashed the GOP 
platform: "The one adopted yesterday is extremely conservative, 
careening to the right on social issues like immigration, 
welfare, and homosexual rights, and omitting the word 'tolerance 
in an unbending abortion plank that fueled weeks of bitter 
intraparty debate."<p>

<h3>Two CBS Spins on Powell</h3>

Monday night Dan Rather said: "General Colin Powell was generally 
applauded by most of the delegates. There was a point, however, 
when he was clearly booed by many of the delegates in this hall. 
It wasnt just a case of scattered boos when Colin Powell said `I 
support a womans right to choose on abortion, and `Im a 
supporter of affirmative action. Thats the point when the boos 
came."<p>

On Tuesdays CBS This Morning co-host Jose Diaz-Balart delivered 
a different take: "General Colin Powell was the four-star hero of 
the evening, moving the crowd to numerous standing ovations and 
even cheers for his most controversial comments."<p>

<h3>Attention Bill Paxon</h3>

Keynote speaker Susan Molinari isnt married? During Tuesdays 
World News Tonight anchor Peter Jennings posed this question to 
an ABC reporter: "I want to go down to the floor for a moment to 
ask a fairly important question of Michel McQueen. Susan 
Molinari: single, white professional woman is going to be up 
there. You could argue that shes going to look out of place in 
some respects at this convention, couldnt you?" A few minutes 
later Jennings admitted he had `goofed.'<p>

<h3>A Bit of Media Intolerance?</h3>

As three MRC employees were leaving the Horton Grand Hotel in San 
Diego on Tuesday, they were approached by a woman wearing a 
Dateline NBC hat, traveling with three credentialed NBC 
cameramen. She inquired if their `Team Clinton' T-shirts were 
pro-Clinton, to which one MRC employee replied, "No, you have to 
read the whole thing." After she read the `pro-Clinton press 
corps' caption on the shirt featuring a drawing of three TV 
anchors, she quipped, "Oh, theyre anti-media. I guess the term 
`extremist still fits, huh?"<p>

<center><h2>Republicans Called Unconcerned About <a name="rape">Rape</a> Victims:
Another Round of Media Intolerance</h2></center>

Prime time and the evening news shows again emphasized how the 
Republican Party is shutting out pro-choicers and on how women 
are turned off by the party's stands. See page one for a tally on 
the agenda of questions.<p>

Keynoter Susan Molinari got grilled from the left by Tom 
	Brokaw on NBC Nightly News: After asking about how women can 
relate to a platform  that's "pretty rigid in its language on 
abortion," he posed this question: "In the convention hall itself 
tonight, as you try to reach out to American women across all 
spectrums of American life, you have here a delegates [sic] by a 
factor of two to one, white males, many of whom are making more 
than $100,000 a year. Doesnt that make it difficult for a lot of 
American women to identify with...."<p>

Just after rape victim Jan Licence's speech on victims rights 
last night, NBC's Maria Shriver seemed baffled: "But why [speak 
out] at a Republican convention? So many people have said that 
they dont think this ticket, or perhaps this party, is 
supportive of womens issues. Why make this stand here?" Tom 
Brokaw interviewed Licence later and asked: "Do you think -- this 
is a party that is dominated by men and this convention is 
dominated by men as well...Do you think before tonight they 
thought very much about what happens in America with rape?"<p>

ABC's Peter Jennings endorsed the "rights" spin of women who 
oppose the GOP's abortion plank: "Polls commissioned by the 
Republican party show they have lost nearly ten percent of women 
since they have voted the Republican majority into the 104th 
Congress in 1994. The right to abortion has never been an over-
whelming issue for women at election time. But this fight within 
the Republican party has many Republican women questioning how 
far this party is willing to go to limit their rights."<p>

Michel McQueen of ABC found the Democratic quota system to be 
better: "When you go to the Democratic convention in Chicago in 
two weeks youll see that half the delegates on the floor are 
women. And thats a powerful message when half the voters are 
women. But dramatically its also true that women have not 
responded well to a message that at times been considered too 
harsh, too mean."<p>

<i>"Ronald Reagan will still have to learn how 
history will judge his time in office -- the deficits, the  
Iran-Contra affair. But for the members of this party, there is  
no more beloved figure." <p>
-- NBC's Tom Brokaw after Nancy Reagan's  
address which followed a video tribute to former President  
Reagan, August 12 NBC News convention coverage. </i><p>

<P> 
<CENTER><H3>Networks Obsess Over Abortion</H3></CENTER> 
<P> 
<P> 
Monday's coverage of the Republican convention was a near carbon  
copy of the themes emphasized over the weekend. Viewers of Monday's  
morning shows heard repeated questions about why the Republicans excluded  
pro-choice voices. On the evening shows and in prime time coverage  
they heard references to the GOP's harsh, and extreme platform.  
Several reporters used retired General Colin Powell's speech as a  
foil to contrast his themes against the media-promoted image of the  
1992 convention. 
<P> 
Looking at the bright side of the Jack Kemp pick, on Today 
Monday morning NBC's Tim Russert argued it might prevent the  
GOP from employing a certain strategy: "This may be an enormous  
public service. If Jack Kemp's presence on the Republican ticket  
neutralizes the race issue, if the race card is not played in 1996  
because of Jack Kemp, he will have achieved more than any national  
figure in a long time. In 1988, the Willie Horton ad. Jack Kemp has  
said that was just absurd."

A Scary, Harsh, Extreme and Radical Republican Platform  
Not Even Counting Abortion. 
<P> 
On CBS Lesley Stahl declared without supporting information: "On  
the platform, women find that extreme. It's turning them off." 
Dan Rather asked Jack Kemp if he agreed that the platform is "harsh,  
extreme, even radical."  
<P> 
Exclusion of Pro-Choicers the Number One Concern of Reporters. Today's Katie  
Couric posed seven questions about abortion, even demanding that Dole's  
daughter Robin explain her abortion views. She asked Senator Kay  
Bailey Hutchison: "Do you still believe you can call the Republican  
Party an inclusive party?" See page 3. 
<P> 
Reporters Dismiss Dole Tax Plan as Failed Reaganomics. "Do you worry  
about the budget deficit ballooning as a result?" CNN's Bob Franken  
asked George Shultz on Monday.

<CENTER><H2><a name="the media's">The Media's</a> Exclusionary Rule</H2></CENTER> 
<P> 
Conventioneers Battered with Abortion Questions All Day 
<P> 
The networks stayed on message in harping on Republican exclusion  
of pro-abortion podium speakers. Just after noon Pacific time  
CNN's Charles Bierbauer asked Congressman Sam Brownback of  
Kansas: "But haven't some of those who might feel that abortion  
rights defensible, haven't they been excluded?" Candy Crowley  
asked pro-abortion Sen. Arlen Specter: "Do you think there is  
ever going to be room on the Republican ticket for someone like  
you?" 
<P> 
On NBC's Today on Monday, Katie Couric posed at least seven  
abortion questions.  To Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison: "You know a  
lot has been made of the Republican Party being a very inclusive  
party, one that can embrace the views of various people. Given  
the way the platform has worked out vis a vis abortion, and the  
fact that some of these Republican governors are not speaking  
because they felt, as if they were being censored. Do you still  
believe you can call the Republican Party an inclusive party?" 
<p> 
During the 1992 convention, Couric only asked Clinton's mother  
Virginia Kelley puff questions: "I also read in the many things  
that have been written about your son and his childhood that he  
used to walk to church alone with a Bible under his arm.' But  
Couric felt compelled yesterday to ask Dole's daughter Robin:  
"You all don't agree on all things political. I know you differ  
with him in terms of his views on abortion. Do you have  
discussions? Do you talk about it, talk it out, exchange views?" 
<P> 
But CNN exemplified an ironic new twist: excluding or downplaying  
conservatives wasn't censorship, but cleverly manipulative stage  
management. Reporter Frank Sesno declared Monday afternoon: "The  
placement of the various speakers at this convention is very  
purposeful and during this session, during this afternoon, some  
of the more hard line conservative speakers, such as Sam  
Brownback, were placed. We're not going to hear that rough edge  
tonight in prime time. Sesno's tone grew sharper: "The keynote  
speech will be delivered by a woman by the name of Susan  
Molinari. She is someone who is here with a very deliberate aim,  
and that is to take a belt sander to some of the sharper edges of  
the Republican Party." 
<P> 
ABC's Peter Jennings told Monday's San Diego Union Tribune:  
"Whenever a political party goes out of its way to restrain,  
isolate, or box in other voices , and both parties do it , then  
you almost invariably attract the attention of journalists." But  
Jennings ignored the Democrats' spiking of Bob Casey in 1992.  
Whether he lives up to his own statements this year will be  
tested in two weeks in Chicago.

Following Colin Powell's speech, reporters quickly pointed out the difference between this convention and  
the "divisive" Houston convention in 1992.   
<DD>  
Andrea Mitchell declared on MSNBC: "There's a real interesting contrast here because Pat Buchanan set  
the tone for the Houston convention four years ago with the same prime time starring role on the first night  
of the convention and that of course was the speech that many people feel destroyed George Bush's chance  
of winning re-election because it set a very narrow, exclusive and mean-spirited tone and tonight we had  
the contrast of Colin Powell."  
<DD>  
On Monday's Good Morning America, host Charles Gibson couldn't let the issue die: "It is this convention  
that is going to be harmonious. The Republicans are determined that there will be no repeat of Houston  
1992, which many saw as a harsh and divisive convention." While never mentioning that raising taxes  
could have cost Bush the election, ABC's John Cochran opined on World News Tonight: "The one thing  
that Bush did not have to tell Dole is that at all cost Dole should try to prevent a re-run of that bitter  
divisive convention four years ago in Houston, that so badly damaged Bush's chances for re-election. Dole  
knows that only too well."

With the GOP showcasing the inoffensive lineup of former  
Presidents Ford and Bush as well as retired General Colin Powell,  
the networks made sure viewers learned that the Republican  
platform still upheld the party's ideological hard line. 
<P> 
NBC's David Bloom announced an amalgam of antis on Monday's  
Nightly News: "But not a word today from Bob Dole about the tough  
anti-immigration, anti-affirmative action, anti-abortion platform  
adopted this afternoon at the convention hall." Later in the  
show, NBC's Lisa Myers ended a story: "One Dole strategist has a  
different standard [of convention success]. He said he'll  
consider this convention a hit if the viewers end the week  
thinking Republicans aren't quite as scary as they thought." 
<P> 
"Even some Republicans describe the current platform as quote,  
harsh, extreme, even radical. Do you see it that way?" Dan Rather  
asked Jack Kemp on Monday's CBS Evening News.  
<P> 
During prime time, CBS reporter Lesley Stahl added: "The whole  
purpose of tonight's convention, the whole program, is to  
diminish the image of this party as extreme because that's what's  
turning the women off. Four years ago, the main speaker at the  
convention, the Republican convention, was Pat Buchanan. He was  
yelling, his pitchforks were raised. Tonight it will be Colin  
Powell, he will appeal to civility. On the platform, women find  
that extreme. It's turning them off." 






<CENTER><H2><a name="gutless">Gutless</a> Moderates?</H2></CENTER> 
<P> 
<P> 
In the August 19 Newsweek, Senior Editor Jonathan Alter gave pro- 
abortion Republicans his recipe for political success. In a piece  
titled "The Passion Gap," he wrote: "Pro-choice Republicans  
insist it's their party, too. But the high-minded moderates are  
too polite to take on the hard-charging right. Until they do, the  
GOP may never truly win over the country." 
<P> 
The crux of Alter's wisdom? Attack your most loyal voting block:  
"This is now the fifth nominating convention in which the GOP has  
applied an anti-abortion litmus test. Ronald Reagan signed an  
abortion-rights law as Governor of California, then changed his  
position in time for his presidential campaigns. George Bush was  
such a supporter of family planning as a congressman that he was  
called 'Rubbers,' but by the 1980s had flip-flopped. Bob Dole is  
pro-life but has gone back and forth so many times on platform  
language and planks that he has raised basic questions about his  
leadership. If he can't stand up to a Phyllis Schlafly, how would  
he handle a Saddam Hussein?" 
<P> 
Alter closed by holding up the Democratic Party, the same party  
that shut Governor Bob Casey out of its  1992 convention for his  
pro-life views, as an example of the big-tent the GOP should  
emulate: "The only real way to change the Republican Party is  
for...a pro-choice candidate to run for President in  
2000....Sometime soon a compelling moderate Republican will take  
a leaf from the successes of centrist Democrats and enter a few  
primaries. Then we'll find out if the Republicans can finally  
pitch that big tent they like to talk about."

Two reporters cheered Colin Powell's denunciation of corporate

to reduce it or how NBC is a recipient. 
On MSNBC, correspondent Andrea Mitchell never reflected on the  
hard choice her own network made when NBC decided to make money  
in prime time by joining up with PBS for convention coverage:  
"One of the things that I thought was interesting about Colin  
Powell's speech is that he did talk about the hard choices and he  
said, 'Listen friends, let me put it to you. We're going to have  
to give up corporate welfare as well and that entitlements are  
the real issue.'" 
<P> 
PBS anchor Charlayne Hunter-Gault said to Gary Bauer after Powell  
left the podium: "You heard the reaction in the room at the  
conclusion of the speech. You also heard Mark [Shields] say that  
when he talked about corporate welfare and welfare for the  
wealthy there was a deafening silence in the room. How do you  
think this crowd is really receiving this message."

<CENTER><H3>Tax Plan Declared Failed Reaganomics</H3></CENTER> 
<P> 
<P> 
The offering of tax cuts is universally seen as good politics,  
but that doesn't mean reporters won't try to make them unpopular.  
Bob Dole's new tax cut proposal and selection of Jack Kemp as his  
running mate may be making headway in the polls, but journalits  
are trying to put on the brakes. For reporters all tax cuts are  
bad.     
<P> 
Brand new CBS This Morning co-host Jose Diaz-Balart declared  
Monday: "It will be interesting to see if Bob Dole, who'd been  
skeptical of supply-siders like Jack Kemp in the past, can sell  
this to the American people without being perceived as a  
hypocrite." Other reporters assumed that supply-side economics is  
a failed doctrine and that tax cuts will "balloon" the deficit as  
they allegedly did in the Reagan years: 
<P> 
Just before noon Pacific time on Monday, CNN's Bob Franken asked  
George Shultz on the convention floor: "I wanted to talk to you  
about the fact that you worked with Republican Bob Dole on his  
economic plank. Were you pleased that there were tax cuts in  
there, and do you worry about the budget deficit ballooning as a  
result?" 
<P> 
On Inside Washington just before Dole released his plan, Newsweek  
Washington Bureau Chief Evan Thomas declared: "There are millions  
of quotes from Bob Dole all through the '80s saying, Look, you  
can't just cut taxes and expect the economy to do much better.  
Now he's screeched around, 180 degrees, and he's sounding like a  
pie-in-the-sky, Reaganomics professor. It's, it doesn't suit his  
character and he's giving up some high ground. Now Bill Clinton  
looks like the responsible guy." 
<P> 
Headline in the August 5 USA Today: "Dole's Tax Plan Could  
Backfire, Experts Say: Deficits, interest rates could rise."  
NBC reporter David Bloom quickly declared on the August 5,  
Nightly News: "Most economists say the Reagan tax cuts did  
worsen the budget deficit and many are skeptical of Dole's plan."  
Mike Jensen agreed about "most economists" minutes later: "They  
say these tax cuts could cause huge budget deficits as they did  
during the Reagan years, debt that would have to be paid off by  
future generations....Most analysts say it's not good economics." 
<P> 
Minutes after Dole's tax cut address that day, U.S. News & World  
Report Senior Writer Susan Dentzer suggested on CNN that the  
people didn't care about fiscal realities: "I think it's going to  
sell very well among those who, for one thing, think that  
government is taxing them too heavily and don't have a  
calculator, don't particularly care about the details of federal  
fiscal policy and don't particularly want to add up the  
dimensions of the problem or stare into the future that we know  
we face." 
<P> 
<P> 
Newsweek reporter Howard Fineman stressed in the August 12 issue  
that Dole "risks his most cherished asset: his credibility...Now  
he's embracing supply-side economics, years after it came (and  
went) in GOP circles. So late in his career , so late in his  
campaign , it looks desperate. Clinton, meanwhile, can brag that  
the annual deficit on his watch , and that he's a champion of  
fiscal responsibility. In other words, he can be Bob Dole." 
<P> 
<CENTER><H3><a name="reality">Reality</a> Check:</H3></CENTER> 
<P> 
<P> 
Monday's Investor's Business Daily pointed out: "Just turn to  
page 369 of the 'Economic Report of the President'...A table  
shows that receipts from individual income taxes rose to $446  
billion in fiscal '89, President Reagan's last budget, from $286  
billion in fiscal '81, the year Reagan began to slash personal  
rates. That's a 56 percent gain. Annualized, tax receipts grew  
faster than the period's average 4 percent inflation. The problem  
was clearly NOT a fall in revenues. It was the other side of the  
ledger: Spending grew even faster. Look at the 'total outlays''  
column in the same table. Spending rose to $1.143 trillion in '89  
from $678 billion in '81. That's a 69 percent gain. It's no  
surprise that Clinton, a professional politician, would brush  
over such inconvenient facts. Media figures who claim to have no  
hidden agendas, on the other hand, have no excuse."  
<P>
<P> 
<CENTER><H3><a name="inside">On Inside</a> Washington:</H3></CENTER> 
<P> 
Evan Thomas, Newsweek's Washington bureau chief: "I think 
this is really disappointing. 
<P> And more advice from the left from Thomas: "Maybe pandering  
works,  
but the polls don't show that. The polls, I think, even Dole's  
own  
polls show that most people reject this tax cut because they  
don't  
believe it. They got conned in the 1980s by Reagan, they got a  
tax cut, 
but they still got a, it didn't do what he predicted it would do 
to the economy. They're in a highly cynical mode, I don't think 
they believe his pandering. In fact, if you ask the question, 'Do 
you approve a tax cut if it would increase the deficit?' only 11 
percent of the country, according to one reputable poll, went 
for it, so I think it's lose-lose." 

<CENTER><H2><a name="millionaire">Millionaire</a> Anchors Tag GOP Delegates As Out of Touch with Middle America</h2></center>
<P> 
<P> 
Early in Monday's PBS/NBC coverage, Tom Brokaw asked: "The big question, of course, what is the  
Republican Party these days?...Well on the floor of this convention hall, they are overwhelmingly white  
and male, male by a factor of about two to one...The largest single income group, more than 38 percent of  
the people here earn more than $100,000 a year." Some additional examples from Monday of how the  
networks created an image for viewers of an out of touch elite gathered in San Diego: 
<P> 
Ed Bradley on the CBS Evening News last night: "For the most part they are white, male, and they are  
older than the average American. They are also more conservative than the average American. They are  
also wealthier , about a third of the delegates earn more than $100,000 a year." 
<P> 
Dan Rather in prime time: "Delegates in this convention have been selected, inspected, detected,  
categorized by the press, the pols, the pros, and the pollsters. We know they're mostly male,  
overwhelmingly white, mostly well to the right politically, and almost one in five of these delegates is a  
millionaire." 
<P> 
CNN's Judy Woodruff to Susan Molinari: "We look at the statistics of how many women delegates. What?  
43 percent in 1992. Only 36 percent of the delegates are women this year. What sort of signal does that  
send to the country, you think? 
<P> 
Woodruff again last night: "We talked to Jack Kemp a little while ago and asked him about, among other  
things, the fact that not only not just the language in the platform , only three percent of these delegates are  
African American. Only 36 percent of these delegates are women. This is not a convention that is  
necessarily representative even of the broader Republican Party, the people who vote Republican, much  
less the electorate overall." 
<P> 
So, will these reporters apply equal treatment to the unreprersentative Democrats gathering in Chicago in a  
few days?  <p>

<h3> Quote of the Day:</h3>
"Governor, looking at this platform writing the last week, what
in the world is good in there for a moderate Republican or an
independent voter in this country?" -- CBS correspondent Phil
Jones to Texas Governor George W. Bush, August 11 Face the
Nation.

<h3>Call GOPers Mean, Intolerant & Hard Line
Media's Unwelcome Greeting</h3>
<p>
Republicans and conservatives came under media assault in the
days  and hours before they assembled at the San Diego Convention
Center. The intolerance of conservatives, their hard line stance
on abortion  and mean-spirited nature were the dominant themes of
weekend coverage  on the networks. Though VP nominee Jack Kemp
largely escaped condemnation,  network analysts used praise of
him as an opportunity to impugn conservatives overall.
<p>
<h3>Inside today's edition:</h3>
<p>
Mean-spirited and hateful  Republicans. CBS, CNN and ABC all
refer to "mean-spirited" conservatives. The Wall Street Journal's
Al Hunt tagged the  platform as "mean-spirited." CNN's Bill
Schneider charged that "they're  supposed to be haters" as "most
conservatives these days," such as House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
"come across as mean." CNN's Judy Woodruff  said that at least
Kemp does not like the idea of "yanking money away  from welfare
mothers with small children." See page 2.
<p>
Intolerant Republicans Bar Wilson from Speaking. On four Sunday
network mornings shows
Republicans were pounded with 22 questions about why pro-choice
Governors Pete  Wilson and Bill Weld were not going to be allowed
to speak. That's  a dramatic contrast to what happened in 1992
when the networks virtually ignored the Democratic Party decision
to bar pro-life Governor Bill Casey from speaking to their
convention. Wilson apeared on ABC, but  the network didn't
interview Casey in 1992. See page 3.
<p>
"Rogue Elephants" Take Over GOP and Spell Sure Defeat. Using
labels to paint delegates as extremists, CBS aired several
stories about the ominous takeover of the Republican Party by, in
Dan Rather's words, "the hard right." CBS reporter Linda Douglass
worried that if Bob Dole appears to be "under the thumb of
religious conservatives" he'll go down to defeat. See page 4.

<h3>GOP Called "Mean" & Conservatives Dubbed "Haters"
TV Analysts Turn Nasty</h3>
<p>
A  "mean-spirited" and "divisive" convention attended by "haters"
is how some network reporters and analysts, especially CNN s Bill
Schneider, have described the Republican convention and
conservatives over the past few days. Often, the comment came in
backhanded insults in stories praising Jack Kemp s tolerance.
Here, in date order, are some specific examples:
<p>
CBS s Russ Mitchell. On Friday s CBS This Morning, co-host Russ
Mitchell asked RNC Chairman Haley Barbour: "Now the 1992
convention was called, even by some Republicans, divisive and
mean-spirited. How will this convention be different?"
<p>
CNN's Bill Schneider. Hours later on Inside Politics Bill
Schneider, CNN s polling analyst, praised Jack Kemp by impugning
conservatives: "He is a rare combination a nice conservative.
These days conservatives are supposed to be mean. They re
supposed to be haters. Bob Novak talked a minute ago about the
frowning face of the Republican Party. Jack Kemp is buoyant, he s
effusive, he s inclusive of everybody in the country, not just in
the Republican Party. He puts a different face on that ticket."
<p>
ABC s Cokie Roberts. Then on Friday night's World News Tonight
Cokie Roberts also insulted Republicans while calling Kemp a good
choice: "He s very optimistic, but he's also very inclusive,
reaching out to minorities, to women, being for immigration, for
affirmative action. And I think that s very important for this
particular convention, Peter, and this party, which is seen
somewhat dour, and somewhat mean in its ways to have someone with
a big smile on his face saying you all come, and I m going to cut
your taxes while I m at it is not a bad thing for the
Republicans."
<p>
CNN s Al Hunt. On the August 10 Capital Gang Saturday night Al
Hunt, Executive Washington Editor of The Wall Street Journal,
disparaged the platform while praising the Kemp pick: "But, you
know, privately the Democrats know that this is an enlightened
choice, whatever Chris Dodd may say publicly. Jack Kemp is gonna
not only excite this convention, but he cuts across regional,
racial and generational lines, across all of America, and I think
that he and his incredibly attractive family are going to add
lustre and intellectual firepower. Now there are some risks. He
has a few flaky views, the gold standard for one, and more
important, Jack Kemp is a can-do optimist who cares about all
people and that s going to put him at odds with a platform that
is protectionist, mean-spirited, anti-immigration, insensitive to
racial minorities."
<p>
CNN s Judy Woodruff: During live coverage Saturday of the VP
announcement in  Russell, Kansas,  Judy Woodruff declared: "On
welfare, up through the last few years, he s advocated more
moderate policies than those that were passed this month by the
Republican-controlled Congress. Jack Kemp does not like the idea
of taking money yanking money way from welfare mothers with small
children."
<p>  
CNNs Schneider. On Saturday s Inside Politics Schneider again
impugned conservatives as he praised Jack Kemp s tolerance: "Kemp
also has a rare combination of qualities. He s a nice
conservative. There haven t been too many of those since Ronald
Reagan. Most conservatives these days come across as mean [video
of Newt Gingrich] or intolerant [video of Pat Buchanan]. Kemp is
tolerant and inclusive. He has an excellent relationship with
minorities. He showed real courage two years ago when he came out
against Proposition 187, the punitive anti-illegal immigration
measure in California. Kemp is not a hater." 
<p>
So most conservatives are? Sounds like a bit of mean-spirited
name calling on behalf of the media.

<p>  
<h3>Networks That Ignored Casey Dive Into GOP Controversy
The Fascinating Wilson Flap</h3>
<p>  
ABC's Cokie Roberts asked Dole adviser Donald Rumsfeld on This
Week with David Brinkley yesterday: "We just heard Jim Wooten
talking about [California Gov.] Pete Wilson not talking at this
convention. Governor Weld is also not talking at this  
convention. Republicans for years have been talking about the
Democrats not allowing [then-Pennsylvania Gov.] Bob Casey to talk
at their last convention. What s different here?" What s
different is that the lack of speaking assignments for Weld and
Wilson are spurring major media interest. 
<p>
Just during the Sunday morning interview shows, the networks
asked 22 questions about exclusion of pro-abortion Republicans.
During the entire Democratic convention week in 1992, Casey s
predicament drew absolutely no mention from Cokie s network, nor
any attention from CBS; NBC aired just one interview with Gov.
Casey, as did CNN, which added four other mentions of the
underplayed controversy  in prime time. Yesterday, 11 questions
about the GOP s  exclusion of moderates were posed on CNN s Late
Edition, compared to five on NBC s Meet the Press, four on ABC s
This Week, and two on CBS's Face the Nation.
<p>
If pro-choice forces cannot prevail, then why even hold a
convention asked one morning show host last week. Today co-host
Matt Lauer asked Gov. Wilson on  August 8: "You said a second ago
that the majority of Republicans across the country are on your
side on this issue, but the majority of people who ll attend this
convention are not. Why then even hold the convention if it
doesn't express or represent the views of the majority of people
in the party?"

<h3> Page Three, Monday, August 12, 1996</h3>
<p>  
<h3>Sixty TV Stories on the GOP to One for the Democrats
Abortion Plank Imbalance</h3>
<p>  
As the surf arrives on San Diego s beaches, once again the
national media are hanging ten on their favorite convention
story: Republican fratricide over the platform s abortion
plank. Since April 30, when Governors Weld, Wilson, Whitman, and
Pataki declared their intention to challenge the platform s
traditional pro-life plank, the networks have focused like a
laser beam on the story, while ignoring any debate within the
Democratic party:
<p>
>From April 30 to August 9, the Big Three networks (ABC, CBS, and
NBC) have favored the Republican side of the story by 60 to 1.
They  aired 30 full stories on the evening newscasts, to only one
ABC World News Tonight story on the Democratic abortion debate on
June 12. The network morning shows have aired another 30 full
stories or interview segments on the GOP abortion debate, to
nothing on the Democrats. (That doesn t include five anchor
briefs on the evening shows and 34 anchor briefs on the morning
shows.)
<p>
CNN's evening newscast The World Today aired seven full stories
and ten anchor briefs on the GOP pro-life plank, to only one
anchor brief on the Democrats. CNN s Inside Politics was
intensely interested in the story, with 38 full stories or
interview segments on the GOP to two segments on the Democrats.
<p>
Perhaps the dramatic imbalance of stories will change when the
Democrats hold their platform hearings? Wrong. The Democrats
already held their platform hearings (on July 10 and 11, then
concluding on August 5) with absolutely no notice from ABC, CBS,
or NBC. You also couldn't read about them in Time, Newsweek, or
U.S. News & World Report. Even daily newspapers such as the Los
Angeles Times and USA Today, with hundreds of pages of newsprint
to fill every week, spiked the story.
<p>
Judd, June 12: "An ABC News survey shows that a third of
Democrats oppose all or most abortions, but centrists and
liberals have no intention of surrendering any ground." Judd
dismissed the threat of pro-lifers actually leaving the party:
"The issue of abortion has not splintered the Democratic party
because those who couldn t live with the party's position
bolted years ago." She concluded: "So given their reluctance to
publicly fight with the party mainstream, abortion opponents will
probably be seen, but not heard at their party's convention this
summer."

<h3>Networks Worry About Ominous Party Takeover by Christians
"Rogue Elephants" No More</h3>
<p>
Colin Powell and Susan Molinari are set to deliver major speeches
to the Republican convention, but network news reporters over the
weekend portrayed the Republican Party as a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Christian Right, painting that as an ominous
development. 
<p>
On Friday, August 9, Dan Rather introduced a CBS Evening News
piece by asserting: "For many self-described Christian
conservatives and other members of what is generally known as the
hard right of the Republican Party, they ve been pretty much
having their way at the San Diego convention, and the Jack Kemp
news late today was one more cause for celebration. But there
could be pitfalls ahead for the party, as we hear now from Linda
Douglass."
<p>
Douglass began: "It already has been a triumphant week for
religious conservatives, led by the Christian Coalition. Then
came word of another victory, the prospect of Jack Kemp as Bob
Dole's running mate." Following a soundbite from Ralph Reed, she
continued: "The Christian Coalition has gotten what it wanted
here, even forcing Dole to back down from his offer of tolerance
to supporters of abortion rights. Religious conservatives say
they now hold the key to a Dole victory in November."
<p>
After a soundbite from the Christian Coalition s Ralph Reed,
Douglass continued: "But veterans of past Republican presidential
campaigns warn Dole runs the risk of appearing to be under the
thumb of religious conservatives. Some analysts believe Gerald
Ford was hurt in 1976 by giving in to a conservative faction.
Doug Bailey, who advised Ford then, said Dole must be careful." 
The same night on PBS s Washington Week in Review host Ken Bode
claimed that "it turns out that this platform committee that met
is a far more conservative group of delegates, than we've
seen even in Republican conventions of the past."
<p>
On Sunday s Face the Nation, CBS correspondent Phil Jones seemed
obsessed with the topic. Jones asked Governor George Bush, "There
are a number of Republicans who are very uncomfortable with what
they feel is the power, the control that the conservative
Religious Right has. Are you concerned about that?" Jones also
accused Pat Robertson of swallowing the Republican Party: "A lot
of moderate Republicans have watched what s going on here in the
last week in the writing of the platform, and they say you
people, you, Pat Robertson and your wing of the Republican party,
Christian conservatives, have taken over."
<p>
"Delegates are pursuing their own agendas and forcing party
leaders, including Dole, to fall into line behind them," warned
Dan Rather on last night s CBS Evening News. Taking a look at the
Texas delegation, reporter John Roberts found that "so far the
rogue elephants seem to be calling the shots: winning the
platform battle over abortion and heavily influencing Bob Dole s
choice for Vice President." 
<p>
Employing some extremist labeling, Roberts said that "hardline
anti-abortionists" tried to keep Texas Senator Kay Bailey
Hutchison from becoming a delegate. But in the end, Roberts
assured viewers, the conservatives really won't win: "This
exercise in gaining political influence may turn out to be just
that: an exercise. Bob Dole says he has not yet read the party
platform and even if he does he says he will not feel bound by
it. And it could be a case for the Texas delegation of
winning the battle but losing the war. Their views against
abortion are in contrast with the majority of Americans who
support a woman s right to choose. That could turn out to be a
contentious issue come November."

<center><h2>***MRC CyberAlert: From San Diego***</h2></center>
<p>
<dd>    Two topics today put together with the assistance of Tim
Lamer back in our Alexandria, Virginia office:
<ol>
<li>CNN and ABC praised the likely choice of Jack Kemp as VP
nominee by contrasting him with most conservatives who are
"mean" and "haters." 
<li>CBS reporter Linda Douglass filed a story Friday night in
which she argued that the appearance that Dole is "under the
thumb of religious conservatives," what Dan Rather referred to
as "the hard right of the Republican Party," could doom his
campaign.
</ol>
<p>
<ol>
<dd><li> On Friday's CBS This Morning, Russ Mitchell asked RNC
Chairman Haley Barbour: "Now the 1992 convention was called,
even by some Republicans, divisive and mean-spirited. How will
this convention be different?"
<p>
<dd>    Hours later on CNN's Inside Politics Bill Schneider praised Jack
Kemp by impugning conservatives: "He is a rare combination -- a
nice conservative. These days conservatives are supposed to be
mean. They're supposed to be haters. Bob Novak talked a minute
ago about the frowning face of the Republican Party. Jack Kemp
is buoyant, he's effusive, he's inclusive of everybody in the
country, not just in the Republican Party. He puts a different
face on that ticket."
<p>
<dd>    Then on Friday night's World News Tonight Cokie Roberts also
insulted Republicans while calling Kemp a good choice: "He's
very optimistic, but he's also very inclusive, reaching out to
minorities, to women, being for immigration, for affirmative
action. And I think that's very important for this particular
convention, Peter, and this party, which is seen somewhat dour,
and somewhat mean in its ways to have someone with a big smile
on his face saying you all come, and I'm going to cut your taxes
while I'm at it is not a bad thing for the Republicans."
<p>
<dd><li>Dan Rather introduced a Friday night Evening News piece:
"For many self-described Christian conservatives and other
members of what is generally known as the hard right of the
Republican Party, they've been pretty much having their way at
the San Diego convention, and the Jack Kemp news late today was
one more cause for celebration. But there could be pitfalls
ahead for the party, as we hear now from Linda Douglass."
<p>
<dd>    Douglass began: "It already has been a triumphant week for
religious conservatives, led by the Christian Coalition. Then
came word of another victory, the prospect of Jack Kemp as Bob
Dole's running mate."
<p>
<dd>    Following a soundbite from Ralph Reed, she continued: "The
Christian Coalition has gotten what it wanted here, even forcing
Dole to back down from his offer of tolerance to supporters of
abortion rights. Religious conservatives say they now hold the
key to a Dole victory in November....But veterans of past
Republican presidential campaigns warn Dole runs the risk of
appearing to be under the thumb of religious conservatives. Some
analysts believe Gerald Ford was hurt in 1976 by giving in to a
conservative faction. Doug Bailey, who advised Ford then, said
Dole must be careful."
<p>
<dd>    Yes, careful not to offend the media and be impugned as 
"mean-spirited haters." -- Brent Baker

<h2>***MRC CyberAlert: From San Diego***</center></h2><p>

<center><h3>    One item today: <p></center></h3>
A Media Reality Check '96 fax report released Wednesday 
afternoon. Back on June 22, 1992 CBS This Morning co-host Paula Zahn 
announced: "Making headlines this morning: Bill Clinton comes up with a 
plan for the economy. Tax the rich, cut the deficit, and help just about 
everyone else." That's not quite how reporters have greeted Bob Dole's tax 
cut plan. In this report we compared and contrasted how media outlets which
have tried to discredit Dole's proposal were the very same outlets which
praised Clinton's economic and health plans.<p>
    The following is the text of the report put together by Tim Graham with 
the assistance of Tim Lamer and the rest of our crew in Alexandria: <p>

<center><h3>The Voodoo Gap: The Media's Partisan Economics</center></h3><p>

<i>SAN DIEGO, CA</i> -- Bob Dole's tax cut proposal was quickly denigrated by 
reporters as the unwelcome return of irresponsible Reaganomics, but the 
outpouring of media skepticism about Dole's tax proposal in no way resembles 
the national media's salesmanlike reaction to Clinton proposals in 1992 and 
1993.<p>

"Raising questions about how Bob Dole's going to cut taxes and balance the 
budget is fair," said MRC Chairman L. Brent Bozell III. "What's not fair is 
attacking Dole's credibility after you've swallowed Clinton's bizarre fiscal 
estimates whole. After passing on the fantasy of a self-financing Clinton 
health plan and 1,000 descriptions of Medicare `cuts,' the media ought to
think about their own credibility on budget matters before they pretend to be 
nonpartisan skeptics of Dole." Among the outlets with a bad case of partisan 
economics:<p>
 
NBC. Reporter David Bloom quickly declared on the August 5, 1996 Nightly News:  
"Most economists say the Reagan tax cuts did worsen the budget deficit and 
many are skeptical of Dole's plan." Mike Jensen agreed about "most economists" 
minutes later: "They say these tax cuts could cause huge budget deficits as 
they did during the Reagan years, debt that would have to be paid off by future 
generations....Most analysts say it's not good economics." NBC did not note as 
columnist James Glassman pointed out Tuesday, that according to Clinton's own
Economic Report of the President, tax revenues increased from $601 billion in 
1983 to $991 billion in 1989, but spending rose from $808 billion in 1983 to 
$1.143 trillion in 1989.<p>

Clinton often drew praise. NBC reporter Lisa Myers raved on the February 18, 
1993 Today: "The President deserved great, great credit for having the courage 
to come forward with a plan to deal responsibly with the deficit." NBC's Andrea 
Mitchell worried about his image on the May 2, 1993 Meet the Press: "This is 
the first President in a generation who had the guts to try to do something 
about deficit reduction and take on health care, and somehow he's not selling 
that. He's still being perceived as an old-style Democrat."<p>
 
CBS. Reporter Linda Douglass declared on the July 23, 1996 CBS Evening News: 
"Dole will have to tread carefully as he promotes his tax cut. Each of the 
proposals he's considering would cost hundreds of billions of dollars, and 
Dole will have to convince voters that won't drive up the deficit."<p>
 
But on the September 15, 1993 Sunday Morning, Douglass simply passed on 
Clinton's notion of paying for 37 million uninsured Americans' health care -- 
with a cigarette tax: "They have a very elaborate plan to pay for this 
revolution in health care. It doesn't provide for much new in the way of 
taxes, just a sin tax, cigarette tax. They claim the money's going to come 
from savings in spending." The Clinton health proposal was estimated by the 
Congressional Budget Office to cost $784 billion in its first seven years.<p>

U.S. News & World Report. Senior Writer Susan Dentzer was the first to 
condemn Dole's tax cut on CNN just minutes after Dole was finished: "The old 
joke among economists is that an economist who's stuck in a ditch gets out
of it by assuming the existence of a ladder, and there are a fair amount of 
assumptions of existences of ladders in this plan that really, I think, under
intense scrutiny, are not going to bear out." Appearing on Nightline a few 
hours later, she called the Dole plan "a free lunch."<p>
 
Dentzer, on the other hand, applauded Clinton's micromanagement of the 
economy in the March 15, 1993 U.S. News: "Amid a broader economic plan that 
has its share of flaws, Clinton's well-crafted stimulus is a piece worth 
keeping...The sorts of spending the President has picked -- for example on 
education or on long-planned highway projects -- tend to create lots of jobs, 
many which carry high wages and benefits."<p>
 
Newsweek. Reporter Howard Fineman wrote in the latest issue that Dole "risks 
his most cherished asset: his credibility....Now he's embracing supply-side 
economics, years after it came (and went) in GOP circles. So late in his career 
-- so late in the campaign -- it looks desperate. Clinton, meanwhile, can brag 
that the annual deficit has been cut in half on his watch -- and that he's a 
champion of fiscal responsibility. In other words, he can be Bob Dole."<p>

Fineman had a different idea of who was responsible for the deficit on the 
October 11, 1995 Fox Morning News: "He [Clinton] really doesn't have to put 
numbers on the table. It's the Republicans who have said they're the 
revolutionaries. They're the ones with the responsibility."<p>
 
Time. Washington Bureau Chief Dan Goodgame declared on September 20, 1993: 
"The Clinton plan is surprisingly persuasive in supporting the long-time 
claim of the Clintons and their top health care strategist, Ira Magaziner, 
that [health] reform can be almost entirely from savings, without broad-based 
new taxes and with enough left over to reduce the federal budget deficit." 
But in the January 29, 1996 issue, Goodgame described the 1980s as "when top
tax rates were slashed and the deficit soared, but that's the reason supply-
siders are often described as optimists." <p>

<h2> ***MRC CyberAlert: From San Diego***</h2></center><p>
 <center><h3>One item today:</h3></center><p>
    A Republican Party platform subcommittee passed a plank stating:
"We also recognize that members of our party have deeply held and sometimes 
differing views. We view this diversity of views as a source of strength."<p>
    Nonetheless, the very networks which barely touched in 1992 the refusal
of the Democratic Party to allow Pennsylvania Governor Bob Casey to make a 
pro-life speech at their convention, pounced on the GOP Tuesday night for 
intolerance.<p>
    --  Here's how Peter Jennings opened the August 6 World News Tonight: 
"Good evening. We begin tonight with what you could certainly call zero 
tolerance. As much as Bob Dole would like to have the nation focus on his
very sweeping tax cutting proposals of yesterday, the men and woman who
will join him at his party's political convention in a few days are once 
again involved in a power struggle about abortion. Today by the time Mr. 
Dole spoke by satellite to his party's delegates, who were already gathered
in San Diego, all notions of tolerance on the subject of abortion had 
disappeared from the party's platform."<p>

    -- On the NBC Nightly News reporter Gwen Ifill's piece ended by showing 
Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld saying in a soundbite: "I don't want to 
drum the pro-lifers out of the party. I just want there to be room for me 
and them within the same description of the party."<p>
    Ifill then concluded: "But there's not enough room for the words abortion 
and tolerance to co-exist in this party's platform. Dole is gambling that 
voters care more about the economy and taxes than they do abortion. But he 
has undercut moderate Republicans at a time when he needs every vote he can 
get. Gwen Ifill, NBC News, San Diego."<p>

     It just shows that it pays to suppress any dissent. When you allow debate
and what reporters consider the wrong side wins they call you intolerant. <p>

<h3>Brokaw Attacks Clinton from Left</h3>
</center>
<p>
July 16, 1996
<p>
One item today: Tom Brokaw challenges President Clinton from
the left in the premiere of "Internight," the 8pm ET interviewshow on the new MSNBC cable network.
<p>
Here are two questions posed by Brokaw in his live July 15 interview:
<p>
    > Brokaw: "Let's talk for a moment about welfare. The
Republicans have a bill that they think you will sign, on the
Hill. It eliminates the federal guarantee of cash assistance for
poor children in this country, a guarantee that we've had in
place since the early 1930s. Are you prepared to have that
happen?"
<p>
    Clinton: "Depends on what else is in the bill."
<p>
    Brokaw: "But you can foresee the possibility that we'll take
away the ultimate safety net of no federal cash assistance to
very poor children?"
<p>
And a couple of segments later:
<p>
    Brokaw: "Mr. President, before we get back to the internet
questions, I wanted to follow up just for a moment on welfare if
I can. If in fact you sign the Republican bill that's likely to
come down from the Hill, all the projections show that that will
push, at least short term, more than a million youngsters in this
country below the poverty line. That's a high risk for youngsters
in this country who are already in peril."

Another network, another pile of bias to document. -- Brent

<h3>Chancellor Reality Check</h3>
</center>
<p>
July 14, 1996
<p>
One item in this MRC Alert: 
<p>
> John Chancellor is being praised for his fairness, but a reviewof his commentaries show he used his position to promote liberalideas and attack conservatives.
<p>
As you may know, NBC News veteran John Chancellor passed away
at age 68 on Friday evening. From 1970 to 1982 he anchored the
NBC Nightly News, then provided commentary through 1993. During
the Johnson Administration he presided over the Voice of America.
His passing has generated a series of tributes to his
fairness and impartiality from his media colleagues. On the July
13 NBC Nightly News, for instance, anchor Brian Williams
observed: "He was a role model for all who care about truth,
justice and fairness. John Chancellor died last night of cancer,
two days short of his 69th birthday. He helped define what TV
news should be."
<p>
Let's take a look at the views expressed in some of his
Nightly News commentaries in the late 1980s and early 1990s:
<p>
    -- April 17, 1990: "The overall tax burden for Americans,
federal, state, and local, is actually quite low....The fact is
Americans could pay more taxes and the country wouldn't go down
the tube. Taxpayers don't believe this because they are being
conned by the politicians...The truth is that the United States
needs higher taxes and can afford them. Some political leaders
are now starting to say that, but until more say it, the country
will remain in trouble."
<p>
    -- August 21, 1991, on the Soviet Union: "It's short of soap,
so there are lice in hospitals. It's short of pantyhose, so
women's legs go bare. It's short snowsuits, so babies stay home
in winter....The problem isn't communism; nobody even talked
about communism this week. The problem is shortages." 
<p>
    -- March 12, 1992: "Greenpeace, the public interest
organization, believes that the Iraqi death toll, civilian and
military, before and after the war, may be as high as 198,000.
Allied military dead are counted in the low hundreds. The
disparity is huge and somewhat embarrassing. And that's
commentary for this evening, Tom." 
<p>
    -- Election night, 1992, looking back at the Republican
convention: "I think that the convention -- and certainly all the
polling data indicates this -- offended a lot of women, offended a lot of people in the country who thought it was too religious
and too hard-edged." 
<p>
    -- February 16, 1993: "There is no mystery in how [the
deficit] can be brought down...the U.S. simply has to choose from
a menu of unpalatable options that include deeper cuts in defense
spending, tougher controls on medical services, higher taxes on
federal pensions, and a broad-based tax on energy or consumption,
preferably both. We know how to do this. Impose measures already
commonplace in other industrialized countries. The weapons are
there. It's the will to use them that's the problem."
<p>
    -- April 30, 1992, after the Los Angeles riots: "It's not a
big surprise that the jury in suburban Simi Valley sided with the
white policemen. Just as it's no surprise that the blacks in
downtown Los Angeles rioted and people died....Politicians have
fanned these flames with code words about `welfare queens,'
`equal opportunity,' and `quotas.' Language designed to turn
whites against blacks. With two-party politics that favored the
rich and hurt everyone else."
<p>
    -- November 20, 1990: "Some say Ronald Reagan won the Cold
War by spending so much on defense that the Kremlin went bankrupt
trying to keep up. That won't wash. During Reagan's presidency
the United States itself became a bankrupt country."
<p>
    -- November 7, 1990: "The fact is that most government
spending cannot be cut. The way out of the mess is for the
government to raise some money through taxes and at last that's
being done. And there's encouraging news in the returns from
yesterday's elections. Six states from Massachusetts to
California rejected measures designed to limit taxation. Can it
be that the great tax revolt of the 1980s is coming to an end? If
true, maybe the country can get on with the business of balancing
its books in a sensible and logical way." 
<p>
    -- June 20, 1989: "Thousands may have been gunned down in
Beijing, but what about the millions of American kids whose lives
are being ruined by an enormous failure of the country's
educational system...We can and we should agonize about the dead
students in Beijing, but we've got a much bigger problem here at
home."
<p>
    -- Finally, here's the July 1990 MediaWatch newsbite on
Chancellor's 1990 book. He's no fan of Ronald Reagan:
<p>
Once anchor of NBC Nightly News, John Chancellor now offers his
opinions thrice weekly. His commentaries have recently been
distilled into a book on what's wrong with America, Peril and
Promise.
<p>
So what's wrong? The deficit, which he attributed to a Reagan
recipe of "big tax cuts, big increases in defense spending, and a
hair curling recession." Pardoned from blame: congressional mismanagement. And though federal revenues went up swiftly in the
'80s, Chancellor remembered only that "cuts in taxes and domestic
spending resulted in the first redistribution of income in favor
of the affluent since the 1920s and a reduction of the federal
government's obligation to the poor." Another Reagan error was
the Grenada liberation which Chancellor called "a sham triumph,"
a "tragicomedy," which "might not have been necessary."
<p>
Chancellor harped on America's faults for 130 pages, but
dedicated fewer than 40 pages to suggesting solutions. He called
his remedies to America's woes neither conservative nor liberal,
yet higher taxes remained the pillar of his plan. Another major
objective: mobilization of a national corps of volunteers because
"The poor and disadvantaged need help, especially after the
cutbacks in social services during the Reagan years."
<p>
I'll be sending another e-mail late tonight with some more
recent bias from Sam Donaldson and coverage of Dole and the
NAACP. -- Brent Baker

<h3>More Hate Radio; Dole Fuels "Racial Divides"</h3>
</center>
<p>
July 12, 1996 
<p>
Four items today:
<ul>
<li>A Time magazine reporter attributes the First Lady's problems
not to any wrongdoing but to the fact that "Mrs. Clinton has
changed the role of First Lady."
<li>Eleanor Clift charges that the evil "right-wing mafia" are
fueling "hate radio."
<li>Newsweek's Joe Klein finds a bright spot in the public's lack
of concern over controversies dogging the Clintons: It may lead
to the end of such distracting scandal-mongering. 
<li>NBC portrays Bob Dole's lack of appearance at the NAACP
convention as "an insult to African-American voters" which "may
reinforce...racial divides along party lines."
<p>
> 1) This quote was picked up by MRC analyst Gene Eliasen fromthe June 28 Washington Week in Review. Time magazine Washingtonreporter Michael Duffy thinks the First Lady is surrounded bycontroversy because she's doing so much more: "I also think thatMrs. Clinton has changed the role of First Lady so much, youknow, by getting so involved and so active and paid such a highprice for it."
<p>
> 2) Appearing on CNN's Larry King Live on Monday July 1,
Eleanor Clift offered this explanation as to who is to blame for 
the Gary Aldrich book: "One thing we haven't really mentioned is
the people who are surrounding Mr. Aldrich and in fact they are
members of what I would call the right-wing mafia. I mean they
were there for Paula Jones and they are fueling a lot of what we
hear on hate radio." MRC analyst Geoffrey Dickens found thatquote.
<p>
> 3) MRC analyst Steve Kaminski caught this conclusion to
Newsweek Senior Editor Joe Klein's July 8 piece on filegate: "But
if Clinton does survive this pounding, it may mean the revulsion
against the `-gate' phenomenon -- 20 years of ever-diminishing
scandals -- is now more intense than the disgust caused by any
individual charge. If so, it would be the President's most
memorable public service." 
<p>
    Funny how he didn't feel that way until the scandals hit a
Democratic President.
<p>
    > 4) After summarizing Bill Clinton's attack on Dole over the
assault weapons ban, on the July 10 NBC Nightly News reporter Jim
Miklaszewski proceeded to review the controversy over Bob Dole
not addressing the NAACP convention. Here's the last two-thirds
of his Wednesday night story as transcribed by MRC intern Jessica Anderson:
<p>
Miklaszewski: "No doubt this was a Clinton crowd. That comes as
no surprise to Bob Dole. Dole had been invited to speak to the
convention yesterday, but declined. He claimed he was already
committed to campaigning and the All-Star baseball game. To those
at this convention that was quite a stretch and an insult to
African-American voters."
<p>
[Woman at NAACP convention: "When you want to be President of the
United States of America, you cannot afford to write any American
off."]
<p>
Miklaszewski: "Back in Washington, Dole's Democratic critics had
a field day."
<p>
[Rep. John Conyers, Jr., (D) Michigan: "He's saying, 'I don't
care about the black vote in November,' and I think that the
black vote in November will not care about him."]
<p>
Miklaszewski: "That already appears to be the case. The latest
NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows Clinton has a lock on the
African-American vote; only five percent would vote for Bob Dole.
[On-screen visual shows Clinton with 87 percent and Dole with
five percent, plus or minus seven percentage points.] But even
Colin Powell believes that Dole should have made an appearance."
<p>
[Gen. Colin Powell (Ret.): "I wish he didn't have a scheduling
conflict. I think it would have been useful for him to present
his views to the NAACP."]
<p>
Miklaszewski: "It would have been a tough crowd."
<p>
[Anonymous man: "I think he made the right move he didn't come
because perhaps he might get booed."]
<p>
Miklaszewski: "Nevertheless, by not showing up here, Bob Dole may
reinforce those racial divides along party lines and fuel the
anxiety among some Republicans that in this presidential campaign
Bob Dole may not be up to the challenge. Jim Miklaszewski, NBC
News, Charlotte."
<p>
So, when Bill Clinton fails to address a Christian Coalition
convention that's an insult to all Christians? -- Brent Baker

<p>
<h3>Taxes vs. Cuts; Carlson Hypocrisy; NBC's Victims</h3>
</center>
<p>
July 11, 1996
<p>
<b>Four items today:</b>
<ul>
<li>Some real bias in Katie Couric's interview with Bob Dole that
got lost in the publicity over smoking. She sees tax cuts and
budget balancing as contradictory.
<li>Time magazine's Margaret Carlson blasts her industry for
publicizing the Gary Aldrich book, but a bit of hypocrisy comes
through when you look at an article she wrote in 1985.
<li>NBC Nightly News discovers and cries over a new class of
"victims" -- those who don't get paid for overtime.
<li>Asked to rate the media's bias from right to left on a scale
of 0 to ten, Eleanor Clift puts the media right in the middle.
</ul>
> 1) The now famous Today exchange about smoking took place
in part two of a three part interview. On the first day, July 1,
Katie Couric displayed the conventional media wisdom about tax
cuts and balancing the budget: you can have one but not the
other. Here are her challenges to Bob Dole as he tries to explain
how he'll achieve both:<br>
    -- "So you don't support across the board tax cuts?"<br>
    -- "What's more important to you, tax cuts or balancing the
budget, if you had to choose?"<br>
    -- "If you had to pick one?"
<p>
     > 2) Margaret Carlson opened her July 15 Time column on
attention to the Gary Aldrich book by charging that "the press
has caught Mad Lie disease, marked by a loss of appetite for the
truth and projectile regurgitation of anything fed to it." In her
last paragraph, she wrote: "There was a time when by common
agreement a book like Aldrich's would die for lack of oxygen. Now
the mainstream media strive to get every sensational rumor 'in
play.'"
<p>    
Well, as MediaWatch Associate Editor Tim Graham reminded me,
let's flip through Carlson's clip book. The July 1989 MediaWatch
quoted this paragraph from Carlson's November 1985 article in
Esquire magazine previewing the 1988 Republican contenders:
<p>
"What one does in Washington behind closed doors generally
stays out of the paper. But the persistent rumor that one of the
potential 1988 presidential candidates has a homosexual past is
testing the unacknowledged code of silence among reporters."
<p>
   > 3) On Tuesday night (July 9), the day the Senate passed a
minimum wage increase bill, Tom Brokaw announced that "the Labor
Department has discovered that millions of American workers are
being shortchanged on another front: overtime. They're working it, but they're not getting the dividend." As transcribed by MRC
intern Jessica Anderson, here are some excerpts from the story
that should have generated little sympathy from those with
salaried jobs.
<p>   
Reporter Mike Jensen began by talking with Becky Perkins who
"raises two children and works long hours as a parole officer in
Texas." She explained: "There's no way you can leave at 5:00. I
mean, you're staying there 'til six, seven, eight, doing just
paperwork alone, not to mention going out into the field to make
home visits."
<p>   
But, Jensen reported, "In spite of the long hours, the state
refused to pay Becky overtime, but the U.S. Labor Department
investigated. It said money was owed, that Becky had been
shortchanged....Workers like Becky are gypped out of an estimated
$20 billion a year in unpaid overtime. The worst offenders?
Construction companies, garment factories, toy makers, auto
repair shops, and food stores. Hundreds of thousands of victims
and very few complaints, says attorney Joan Keyok" [spelling
approximated].
<p>    
Following a soundbite from her, Jensen returned to the
"victim" theme: "Many of the victims are minimum wage workers
afraid of being fired, or immigrants who don't know their rights,
or older workers concerned about downsizing. They never see the
time and a half pay that's legally theirs."
<p>
    > 4) On a 0-10 scale of media bias from right wing to left
wing bias where does Eleanor Clift place the media? Here's her
answer from McLaughlin Group last weekend: "The press is right in
the middle. It's a five. The bias is for bad news."
<p>
    Another sign of progress: Not even a committed liberal like
Clift dares to say anymore that the media are biased to the
right. -- Brent Baker

<Title>Kudos: Sesno Challenges Rivlin, Daschle</Title>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Kudos: Sesno Challenges Rivlin, Daschle</h2>
</center>
<p>
Many in the media have accepted, and passed on as fact, the Democrats' party line that Republicans were out to cut and even destroy Medicare. CNN's Frank Sesno, on the December 17 Late Edition, set the record straight.
<p>
He first interviewed President Clinton's budget director, Alice Rivlin. Sesno confronted Rivlin with the facts: "Take Medicare, for example. You said, the President, rather, yesterday said, `They would let Medicare wither on the vine into a second class citizen.' Now, you don't really believe that the Republicans are going to let Medicare wither on the vine? They're not talking about that. And as you well know, and as they say as many times as they are able, even with their cuts in the rate of growth of the program, it still grows into an ever larger piece of the pie."
<p>
When Rivlin balked at such an analysis, Sesno remained adamant. "In the interest of truth in advertising here, do you really believe that the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader of the Senate want to destroy Medicare?" he asked. "Isn't this part of the Mediscare debate that your critics accuse you of engaging in?"
<p>
After Rivlin, Sesno interviewed Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle (along with GOP Senator Trent Lott). He pointed out to Daschle that "in the health care reform debate, of not very long ago, of which you were a part, there was a great deal of talk that expenses had to be controlled. You had something called global budgeting. I mean you were going to hold everybody down. So why is it unfair to do that in the case of Medicare?"
<p>
Later, when Senator Daschle called the Republican plan to slow Medicare's growth "the biggest cuts in the history of Medicare. Biggest by far. Three times more than has ever been proposed." Sesno corrected him: "Biggest cuts in the rate of growth of Medicare, not absolute cuts."
<p>
Kudos to Sesno for giving Democratic rhetoric the same scrutiny reporters usually reserve for Republicans.

<Title>Issue Review: Federal Funding of Public Broadcasting</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Issue Review: Federal Funding of Public Broadcasting</h2>
<p>
<h3>Donations Rise as Funding Threatened</h3>
</center>
<p>
At this time last year, leaders of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), Public Television (PTV), and National Public Radio (NPR) were calling their viewers and listeners stingy. Not in so many words, of course, but that was in effect their argument when they warned that they would not be able to make up any cut in or elimination of public broadcasting's federal subsidy.
Conservatives, looking at history, argued that when taxes were cut (as Republicans planned), people gave more to organizations they support, including public broadcasting, and that if people truly liked public broadcasting, they would not let it die.
<p>
<b>Who was right?</b><br>
Looking at the results of last year's public broadcasting pledge drives, as reported in the Public Broadcasting Report, it looks like conservatives were correct. Even without a tax cut, merely the threat of cutting public broadcasting's subsidy spurred massive increases in private donations early in the year. Later, when it was clear that the federal subsidy would be kept, donations began to level off.
<p>
Conservatives, in making their arguments, were standing on strong historical ground. During the 1980s, when tax rates were cut, individual donations to public television, for example, increased every year. In fiscal year 1980 there were 2.6 million members of PTV who gave an average contribution of $29.96 for a total of almost $78 million. By fiscal year 1989 the number of members had doubled (to 5.2 million) and the average contribution had increased steadily (to $50.38), giving public television a total of $262 million from individual members. In fiscal year 1991, after the Bush tax increase, the number of individual public television members dropped to 5.07 million.
<p>
Last year, when Republicans in Congress threatened to eliminate or substantially cut public broadcasting's federal subsidy, donations skyrocketed. The first bit of good news came in February. KCRW-FM in Santa Monica, California announced that it had set a record for on-air fundraising by a public radio station in its February 6-14 winter subscription drive. According to the Public Broadcasting Report (PBR), the station "raised $1.09 million from 14,314 new and renewing subscribers," a 26 percent increase over the previous year. General manager Ruth Seymour told PBR that the debate over federal funding spurred the massive increase: "I think our audience understands that we are committed to the effort to keep public radio noncommercial."
<p>
Then public television stations began to note a striking increase in donations. PBR told its readers on March 24 that "PTV stations across the country reported very successful spring pledge drives." The Arkansas Educational Television Network, for example surpassed its $350,000 goal despite reducing the time spent in pledge breaks by ten percent. KRMA-TV in Denver and WETA-TV in Washington, D.C. had record-breaking drives, with KRMA reporting a 13 percent increase over 1994 totals and WETA garnering almost $1 million from 12,600 pledges, 62 percent of which were from new members. KCET in Los Angeles finished its spring pledge drive with $1.68 million, exceeding its March, 1994 drive, which lasted three days longer, by $205,127.
<p>
Nationwide, PBR reported, the number of pledges for March were "12.9 percent above March 1994 returns" and the total dollars pledged were up 15.3 percent. Public radio had similar success. According to PBR, "on average, stations did 15-40 percent better during this drive than they did during last year's campaign." The public radio stations that did "only" 15-20 percent better than the previous year were "those who stopped once they reached their goals."
<p>
The momentum was sustained through the summer. PBR reported on August 25 that "indications are that the August PTV pledge drive will be another hit in a year of overwhelmingly successful campaigns that many have attributed to publicity involving projected federal budget cuts." The number of pledges had increased a dramatic 18 percent over the previous August and pledge dollars were up 16 percent.
<p>
By December, though, when it had become clear that Republicans were not going to eliminate federal funding for public broadcasting, or even cut it substantially, pledge growth slowed. The December pledge drive, according to PBR, collected seven percent more than the December 1994 pledge drive, a healthy increase, but not at the level of the astronomical increases of March and August.
<p>
The moral of the story: Viewers value public broadcasting enough to increase their donations when federal funding is threatened. But when it's clear the government will pay for it, they don't feel the need to pay as much.
<p>
This should reassure public broadcasting executives. During last year's debate, they didn't express much confidence in their supporters. CPB Chairman Henry Cauthen predicted that if federal funding were foregone, 87 public television stations would have to be closed down. (He didn't point out, of course that this would still give PBS more television stations than ABC, CBS, or NBC.)
Public Broadcasting Service president Ervin S. Duggan told TV Guide: "I don't think public TV could survive and maintain its mandate without federal funding. Survival would come at a cost of becoming commercial. We'd be driven by ratings, not quality."
<p>
As the debate continued Duggan became so convinced that individuals wouldn't ante up support for a privatized PBS that he began to speak in harsh tones about the future of the network, comparing privatized television to prostitution. He worried that "commercialized public television is likely to resemble, for all the world, Thomas Hardy's ruined maid: `no longer pure and simple, brazenly working the streets in her new commercial finery, doing whatever necessary to survive.'"
<p>
The evidence suggests Cauthen and Duggan were wrong. When federal funding decreases, private funding increases. If members of Congress really want to strengthen public broadcasting, then they should wean it from the federal government and cut taxes.

<center><h2>Focus on Fortune 500 misses real trends</h2>
<p>
<h3>Lamenting Layoffs, Ignoring Job Rise</h3>
</center>
<p>
The current wave of layoffs at several large companies seems to confirm in many reporters' minds their view of how the business world works: Corporate America racks up record profits for wealthy shareholders while laying off millions of workers.
<p>
That's how the networks have reported the layoffs. But with a little digging these reporters could have found that corporate profits are not unusually high, that shareholders are not just rich people, and that more jobs are being created than destroyed.
<p>
Anchor John Roberts set the tone of the layoff coverage on the December 26 CBS Evening News: "The market has been hitting one record high after another. But as Economics Correspondent Ray Brady reports, many workers have paid a heavy price." Brady then interviewed "ex-Wall Streeter" Michael Thomas, who told viewers what he seemed to think was shocking: "Executives are running companies exclusively for their stockholders."
<p>
This focus on the interests of stockholders, Brady explained, has meant layoffs at such established companies as 3M and AT&T, which caused their stock prices to jump. "Who pays the price for this stock market prosperity?" Brady asked. "Come to any job center, where laid off middle managers scramble desperately for work. Corporate America announced more than 41,000 layoffs last month alone, up 45 percent over the same month a year ago."
<p>
Martha Teichner, Brady's colleague at CBS, joined the chorus on the January 7 Sunday Morning. "For all of 1995, the figure was nearly 450,000, but, hey, that's the good news. In 1993 it was 615,000," Teichner reported. "Here's a statistic for our leaner and meaner times. Since 1980, Fortune 500 companies, America's biggest and most profitable corporations, announced layoffs of more than eight million people. That's like laying off the entire population of New York City."
<p>
Over at NBC, on the January 4 Nightly News, Mike Jensen agreed. After saying that some companies had to downsize in order to survive, he said, "Some companies simply decided to make more money by firing people. Corporate profits totalled about $400 billion last year, up 25 percent. What all those companies did was obliterate one of the keystones of the American Dream, the security of a job for life. They created anxiety for everyone, even those who didn't get fired."
<p>
But just how high are corporate profits? According to the January 4 Investor's Business Daily, which quoted a study by the Employment Policy Foundation, corporate "profits have dropped from an average of 12 percent of national output in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s to about 9 percent currently -- a decline of about 25 percent in profits' share of total output."
<p>
About those supposedly greedy stockholders, the newspaper pointed out that they may not be who viewers were led to believe they were: "With more than half of all Americans now owning stocks through retirement, mutual, and individual shareholder accounts, it is the average American who benefits most from corporate profits -- not some fat cat on Wall Street."
<p>
And here's a statistic for Teichner: "Little noticed among the repeated headlines of Fortune 500 firms cutting jobs are the literally thousands of small and medium-sized firms that are adding new workers at a frenetic pace. Since the start of 1994, more than five million new jobs have been created in the U.S. economy -- more than enough to sop up all the new entrants in the work force."
<p>
Reporters seem to think the entire business world begins and ends with the Fortune 500. Until they start looking at the entire economy, they won't be able to tell the entire story.

Virtually every Republican presidential candidate has endorsed some version of 
the flat tax, as has the Kemp Tax Reform Commission. This support is mirrored 
by public opinion, with polls showing anywhere between one-half and two-thirds 
of taxpayers prefer the flat tax over the current system. Needless to say, with 
all this attention, it comes as no surprise that many in the media have begun 
writing about and describing this revolutionary proposal. Unfortunately, this 
new-found publicity has been accompanied by frequent errors. In order to 
maintain accuracy, reporters should avoid these two most common mistakes:
<P>
Mistake #1: Many reporters write that the flat tax contains a huge loophole for 
the rich because they have trouble understanding how income is taxed under a 
flat tax. This error shows up in several ways. Some report that dividend and 
interest income is tax free. Others write that only labor income is taxed.
<P>
Reality: The source of these common mistakes is that the most well-known 
versions of the flat tax collect taxes on capital income at the source. Under 
the Armey- Shelby flat tax, for instance, a corporation must pay tax on behalf 
of shareholders before the income is distributed in the form of dividends. This 
approach, which reduces administrative costs and ensures greater compliance, 
makes a dividend check similar to a worker's paycheck in that both are 
after-tax payments. The same is true for interest income. Under the flat tax, 
businesses and financial institutions pay tax on interest payments they make, 
so there is no need to collect the tax a second time at the individual level. 
Once again, the motive for taking this approach is simplicity and compliance.
<P>
Message: Reporters can argue that the tax should be collected at the individual 
level. They can even argue that the income should be subjected to two or more 
layers of tax. Honesty demands, however, that they acknowledge that all income 
is taxed with a flat tax, but only taxed once, and that tax is collected in the 
least costly fashion possible.
<P>
Mistake #2: The flat tax will increase the deficit and/or boost taxes on the 
middle class. Many news reports assume that a flat tax will require a tax rate 
of 21 percent or more to offset reductions in excessive tax rates on the rich. 
Even with the generous personal allowance, this tax rate would adversely affect 
the middle class. Failure to levy a rate that high, on the other hand, would 
cause larger deficits.
<P>
Reality: With a 17 percent rate, the Armey-Shelby flat tax explicitly is 
designed to reduce the amount of money the government collects. As a result, 
even without making any assumptions about faster economic growth expanding the 
tax base (the supply-side effect), it is possible for all income classes to 
enjoy a lower tax burden. With regards to the deficit, the plan imposes strict 
new limits on government spending. Enforced by automatic spending control 
mechanisms, this ensures that the deficit will not climb. The key principle is 
that the flat tax is accompanied by spending savings to keep the overall 
package deficit-neutral.
<P>
Message: Conclusions that the middle class is harmed are based on analysis of a 
revenue-neutral tax proposal which does not exist. Reporters can condemn the 
proposal for reducing the amount of money the government collects, and they can 
write that the growth of government would have to be significantly slowed to 
keep the plan deficit neutral as sponsors propose, but it is inaccurate to 
assert that the middle class will pay more or that the deficit will increase.
<P>
With help from biased sources such as the Clinton Treasury Department and the 
union-funded Citizens for Tax Justice, many reporters have unwittingly (we 
hope) made one of these mistakes. Some, like Al Hunt of  The Wall Street 
Journal and Ann Reilly Dowd of Money, have made both mistakes in the same 
article. Fair and accurate reporting depends on the public receiving 
information in a straight- forward fashion. Avoiding these two mistakes will 
help ensure the upcoming tax debate is marked by legitimate policy issues 
rather than distorted media messages.

<h3>Reporters Crash, Viewers Burned</h3>
</center>
<p>
Just when you think reporters couldn't get any more hostile to industry, they do. Consider two mid-January television reports on ABC's Good Morning America and NBC Nightly News. Both stories contain mistakes which often plague reports about automobile safety, and both ignored the trade-offs safety regulations inevitably require. 
<p>
At issue were federal standards for rear guards on tractor trailers. These "U"-shaped metal rods are specifically intended to keep cars that hit the rear of a truck from riding under it. The regulatory standard for the guards has been set at 30 inches from the ground for the past fifty years, although the voluntary industry standard has been 22 inches for several years. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) merely codified this standard with the cooperation of the trucking industry.
<p>
That's the news part. But reporters portrayed this issue as a grand conflict, with industry as a hostile force and supposedly-impartial "consumer advocates" as society's protectors. The question for reporters was how to criticize industry without panning the government in a situation where both agreed. Here's how they answered it:
<p>
Neither report mentioned that industry was already producing 22-inch guards. ABC's Lisa Stark, on the January 19 Good Morning America, reported that "under the new standard, rear guards...must be lowered to 22 inches above the ground. They're now at 30 inches." Tom Brokaw stated in his introduction to the January 17 NBC Nightly News segment, "The government is about to take an action that should save lives." Robert Hager was more explicit in the NBC segment, saying that the government will require new tractor trailers "to be made with big rods on the back, bigger than any currently in use."
Neither report pointed out that most tractor trailers already have the 22-inch guards -- voluntarily.
<p>
Hager employed questionable data. "Nearly 700 [people] a year die in [ride-under] accidents," he declared. But both NHTSA and the trucking industry put the number of deaths at 60 each year. (ABC's Lisa Stark used the NHTSA figure.)
<p>
Both reports projected skepticism of the new standard -- but not of the government -- as insufficiently stringent without offering evidence. In Stark's report, Gerald Donaldson of Citizens for Reliable & Safe Highways (CRASH) stated that the new rule "was not selected on the basis of what would really be a big contribution to improving public safety... [but] on the basis of what the trucking industry would buy into."
<p>
The ubiquitous Joan Claybrook, representing CRASH in Hager's report, said, "We don't think this rule makes significant enough changes....Very few people are going to be protected under this standard." Hager didn't ask Claybrook why, if she was so concerned, she never acted on the rear guard issue when she was head of NHTSA from 1977-1981.
<p>
Neither report was skeptical of these supposedly objective "consumer advocates." The media look at funding only when it comes to industry associations or conservative advocates. That's why we hear about "tobacco-funded groups," but not "trial-lawyer-funded groups." The fact that a group is funded by parties who have a stake in certain outcomes does not necessarily mean that what they say is incorrect. Still, it would have been interesting if the reporters had asked who funds CRASH; they would have discovered that CRASH is substantially funded by the railroad industry.
<p>
Regulations intended to increase safety by decreasing one risk often backfire by creating new risks. For example, the risk of keeping the rear guard at 22 inches means that some small cars could still slip under the truck. But making the rear guard lower means that trucks could get caught on railroad grade crossings or have difficulty maneuvering around rail yards and ports, causing different kinds of accidents. ABC touched on this issue dismissively; NBC only mentioned the dollar cost of the changes.
<p>
When it comes to government regulation of safety, even the most skeptical reporters become true believers. Too eager to criticize industry, and too receptive to "consumer groups" which invariably advocate more government regulation, reporters often believe that we can have more safety at no cost. But overlooking the trade-offs involved in government regulation does not help anyone, and could, in fact, be deadly. Who pays this price? The very people reporters are trying to inform: consumers.

<Title>Issue Analysis: Forbes Proposal Draws Media Fire</Title>

<center><h2>Issue Analysis: Forbes Proposal Draws Media Fire</h2>
<p>
<h3>A Bumpy Road for the Flat Tax</h3>
</center>
<p>
The newest rage on the political scene is the flat tax. It has propelled the presidential candidacy of Republican Steve Forbes, causing most of the other GOP candidates to formulate a version of their own. The flat tax is a simple tax system with complex arguments both for it and against it. Covering such an issue is, therefore, a difficult task. To be fair and balanced, reporters at the very least must present the best arguments for it and against it. But so far, the best arguments for the flat tax have rarely made the news.
<p>
Media Research Center analysts reviewed all of the flat-tax stories on network evening news shows (ABC World News Tonight, NBC Nightly News, CBS Evening News) and in national news magazines (Newsweek, Time, U.S. News & World Report) during the month of January. There were 16 stories which presented arguments for or against the flat tax. (There were more about the Forbes campaign generally.) In those 16 stories, arguments against the flat tax were presented 51 times, while arguments in favor of the flat tax were presented only 24 times.
<p>
Double Taxation. The argument against the flat tax most often presented -- 24 times in the 16 stories -- was that it would not tax interest income or investment income, and thus overly benefit the wealthy. For example, ABC's Dean Reynolds, on the January 29 World News Tonight, said the Forbes flat tax would mean "no taxes on inherited wealth or stock portfolios." Newsweek's Marc Levinson and Rich Thomas contended that "investment income would be tax-free." According to Peter Jennings, on the January 15 World News Tonight, "There would be no capital gains tax, no tax on interest earned at the bank, or for money you've made through investments. A millionaire living solely on dividends or inherited money wouldn't have to pay any tax."
<p>
Only twice did a reporter point out that such a millionaire, under a flat tax, would in fact be taxed. Flat-tax proponents argue that investment income would indeed be taxed, but only at the corporate or bank level. As the Heritage Foundation's Dan Mitchell wrote in the January MediaNomics, under the flat tax "a corporation must pay tax on behalf of shareholders before the income is distributed in the form of dividends." Flat-tax proponents argue that, as in the case of withholding, savers and investors currently get less money because it has already been taxed, but still must pay an additional income tax on the money. Only Newsweek's Allan Sloan, in an anti-flat tax article, pointed out that currently "some [income], like corporate dividends, is in effect taxed twice."
<p>
Mortgage Interest. The next most common argument against the flat tax was that the elimination of the mortgage interest deduction would hurt the middle class. Reporters cited such arguments 13 times in the 16 stories. According to the January 15 U.S. News & World Report, "Homeowners could see home values drop if mortgage interest payments and property taxes were no longer deductible." On the January 15 World News Tonight, Peter Jennings weighed in on the issue by only mentioning one side: "President Clinton believes that middle class homeowners will see the value of their homes go down if there is no mortgage deduction."
<p>
Reporters mentioned counterarguments to such claims only three times. For instance, Bob Schieffer, on the January 20 CBS Evening News, said, "Forbes counters those arguments by saying the deduction won't be needed because homeowners will pay less in taxes, which will cause the economy to grow, which will cause interest rates overall to go down." No reporter mentioned that the deduction is actually regressive. John Berthoud of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution pointed out in the January 31 Investor's Business Daily that "80 percent of the break's tax benefits go to those with incomes over $50,000."
<p>
Federal Deficit. Twelve times reporters cited the claim of flat-tax opponents that the flat tax would greatly increase the federal deficit. NBC's Mike Jensen, on the January 17 Nightly News, claimed that "the biggest loser would be the government. With a 17-percent flat tax, critics say the budget deficit could double." According to Jensen: "For poor and middle class families, critics say the 17 percent flat tax is a cruel hoax, that to avoid big deficits, it would have to be much higher than 17 percent."
<p>
Echoing Jensen, ABC's John Cochran, on the January 19 World News Tonight, said that "Forbes' opponents still say his version of the flat tax won't work, that it would increase the budget deficit at a time when Republicans are trying to eliminate it." U.S. News & World Report agreed: "The Treasury Department estimates that a flat-tax rate would need to be set at 21 percent -- not 17 percent -- to raise the same level of revenues as the current income-tax system does. Without raising this rate, the federal government would see its budget deficit rise, and this would add to Washington's fiscal woes."
<p>
Only half as many times -- six -- did reporters give the counterargument that the flat tax would not increase the federal deficit. Time's Dan Goodgame, for example, wrote that Forbes "assumes that tax cuts, even when financed by federal borrowing, will generate so much economic growth that they will quickly wipe out the deficit." Goodgame, though, dismissed such a belief as a "quasi-theology."
<p>
Noting that Forbes' 17 percent rate might be a revenue-loser for the government, some reporters wondered how Forbes would make up the shortfall. Newsweek's Allen Sloan asked: "How will he fill the gap? With economic growth and spending cuts. Details? Forbes isn't saying." Time's Goodgame criticized Forbes because he "declines to specify spending he would cut." It's true that Forbes has not been specific about spending cuts. But then reporters rarely give such reprimands to politicians who oppose slowing entitlement growth, but decline to specify how much taxes will then have to increase. Why the double standard for Forbes?
<p>
Charitable Contributions. Twice reporters mentioned the argument that a flat tax would hurt charities by removing the deduction for charitable contributions. According to ABC's Peter Jennings, on the January 15 World News Tonight, "Charities worry about how generous folks will be if their contribution is no longer deductible." The January 15 U.S. News & World Report similarly warned that "charities could lose donations if contributions were no longer deductible."
<p>
No reporter mentioned the counterargument that charities would not be hurt by a flat tax. John Berthoud's Investor's Business Daily article points out that "of $117 billion donated [to charities] in 1991, $56 billion came from non-itemizers. Of the $61 billion that was deducted, 54 percent came from Americans in low-to-moderate tax brackets. Thus, three of four dollars given to charity don't lead to a substantial tax benefit." Berthoud further noted that "top marginal tax rates dropped from 70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent in 1988, thus robbing the deduction of more than half its value. And the deduction for non-itemizers was eliminated in 1986. Yet charitable contributions rose" at a record pace.
<p>
Flat Tax Favorables. Only two arguments in favor of the flat tax -- its simplicity and its closing of loopholes -- were reported thoroughly. Seven times reporters made the case that the flat tax would make the tax code simpler. CBS's Bob Schieffer, on the January 20 CBS Evening News, pointed out "the simplicity of the plan. No accountants needed to tell you what you owe. No long forms to fill out." Six times reporters pointed out that the flat tax would close loopholes for special interests. Joe Klein, for instance, on the January 21 CBS Evening News, said: "[Forbes'] is a anti-Washington campaign, and that's how he sells the flat tax. He says, `I'll eliminate a whole lobbying industry, the industry that gets tax loopholes for special interests.' And that's the advantage of the flat tax."
<p>
But those were the exceptions. Most of the time arguments against the flat tax were presented without arguments in its favor meriting a mention. At times reporters, such as Newsweek's Allan Sloan, didn't try to hide their fondness for the politics of envy: "Taxing investment income at both the corporate and personal levels, as it's taxed now, may not be sound economics. But it's reasonably sound social policy, considering that most investment income flows to upper-income people." Sloan didn't mention that many investments, such as those in pension funds and mutual funds, are made by the middle class. 
<p>
At other times the opposition to the flat tax became absurd. NBC's Mike Jensen managed to find a middle class couple who claimed that the $3,146 tax cut they would get under the Forbes plan "is really not going to change our lives."
For such a simple policy, the arguments over the flat tax are quite complicated. Still, reporters should not bring up the arguments of flat-tax opponents unless they're willing to give flat-tax supporters a chance to respond.

<Title>Network Assumes Private Money Is Corrupt, Ignores Conservative Argument</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Network Assumes Private Money Is Corrupt, Ignores Conservative Argument</h2>
<p>
<h3>ABC's Missing Campaign Reform Idea</h3>
</center>
<p>
Is there too much money in politics? That question is a rhetorical one for much of the media. They simply assume that there is. So far this campaign season, network newscasts have reported numerous times about the costs of running a presidential campaign and the alleged problems this raises for candidates. Because reporters assume private money hurts politics, they report on every reform option except the one conservatives champion -- raising (or eliminating) the limits on individual donations to candidates.
<p>
Case in point: ABC News. On January 17 and 18 ABC's World News Tonight devoted a total of five stories to the role of money in the presidential campaign, under the title "The Greenback Primary." These stories followed a January 15 Nightline broadcast about campaign-finance reform. The assumption in all of these stories was that money has -- as Peter Jennings put it -- a "corrosive effect" on the political process.
<p>
Various correspondents contributed to the World News Tonight series. Jim Wooten pointed out that front-loaded primaries meant candidates have to raise a lot of money early. "None of the Republicans except Senator Dole has actually reached his fundraising goal," Wooten reported. "He's ahead. There could be a connection." John Donvan illustrated the elaborate means candidates must employ to raise enough money to compete. Bill Blakemore noted the rise of "soft money," such as contributions to political parties and independ-ent expenditures. According to Blakemore: "It's how corporations and unions can snub the law that forbids them to give to presidential campaigns."
<p>
While many of these stories were informative, none questioned the common wisdom that too much money is the problem with the current campaign finance system. None cited the mainstream conservative argument, made by law professor Bradley Smith in a Cato Institute study, that more money would improve politics. Smith wrote: "Considering the importance of elections to any democratic society, it is hard to believe that the expenditure of less than $10 per voter for all local, state, and national campaigns constitutes a crisis requiring government regulation and limitations on spending."
<p>
Ignoring this argument led to biased coverage of possible reforms. On the January 15 Nightline, Jeff Greenfield reported, "We'll be hearing a torrent of words about campaign-finance reform this year, but every proposal for change raises some big questions. Complete public financing? Well, skeptical voters might see that as just another taxpayer rip-off. Force television stations to provide free air time? Who would qualify and who wouldn't? Say to multi-millionaires they can't spend as much as they want on their own campaigns? No, the Supreme Court says that would be unconstitutional."
<p>
While Greenfield skillfully raised objections to all the reform ideas he cited, he didn't mention "every proposal for change." David Frum, in the January 15 Weekly Standard, suggested one proposal conservatives have long advocated -- "a sharp increase in the maximum permissible personal donation." Frum argued that "if [candidates] could raise their money in bigger chunks, they could spend much less time at the task" and that "once large donations could be made directly to the candidate -- which every candidate prefers -- the evil of unaccountable and undisclosed soft money would tend to wither away."
<p>
Reporters are correct to sense that something is wrong with the campaign-finance system. And the liberal view that private money always corrupts political campaigns should be reported fairly. But journalists shouldn't assume liberals are right and report liberal reform plans as if they were the only ones being proposed.

<title>Reporters Don't Challenge Politicians on Anti-Green Subsidies</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Easy on Government Pollution</h2>
</center>
<p>
When the media report on the environment, which will no doubt be a big issue in the upcoming presidential campaign, they almost always employ the same formula. Private industry is portrayed as the cause of all environmental problems; government is portrayed as the protector of the public. This formula ignores one big cause of environ- mental problems -- federal agriculture subsidies, which not only hurt taxpayers and consumers, but also finance environmental destruction.
<p>
Example: recent coverage of the Clinton Administration's proposal to try to restore parts of the Florida Everglades. Most reporters accepted at face value the Clinton plan, which would increase the tax on sugar by a penny per pound to pay for a $1.5 billion program that includes the federal government buying and restoring land in the Everglades.
<p>
According to CBS This Morning's Jane Robelot, on February 20, "The Clinton Administration has announced ambitious plans to save the Everglades from further ecological destruction by raising the tax on sugar." Correspondent Art Rascon continued: "It's the largest infusion of federal dollars ever proposed for the Everglades, making it one of the biggest ecological restoration projects ever."
<p>
Newsweek's Miami correspondent Peter Katel, in the March 4 issue, added that "Clinton's plan is the high-water mark of reform. Senator Majority Leader Bob Dole and Florida's two senators have a more modest plan to spend $200 million of taxpayer funds -- not sugar  money -- to buy some of the sugarcane land for water-restoration projects." Mike Clary of the Los Angeles Times wrote on February 20 that "the administration's seven-year plan to save one of the most endangered ecosystems in the United States is as ambitious and comprehensive as any environmental project of recent years, environmentalists say."
<p>
And according to ABC's Barry Serafin, on the February 19 World News Tonight, "Administration officials say the [sugar] industry, which enjoys generous price supports must pay its fair share, a view shared by many in South Florida, who are determined to bring back the state's fabled river of grass."
<p>
Although none of these reporters were wrong, and a few even pointed out the huge federal subsidy sugar gets from high tariffs, none asked why the government shouldn't simply stop subsidizing sugar. The Competitive Enterprise Institute's Jonathan Tolman told MediaNomics that if the government simply "brought down the tariff wall on sugar, it would discourage overfarming of sugar near the Everglades and make land there less expensive, which would make Gore's program to buy the land less expensive." In addition, no reporter brought up another point Tolman makes: "The Clinton tax increase on sugar will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices."
<p>
Only Eric Schmitt of the New York Times, in a February 29 article about price supports, made the connection between the government subsidies and environmental damage. Schmitt pointed out that "under the sugar program...the government sets price supports that maintain domestic sugar prices at twice those on the world market and, according to the General Accounting Office, cost consumers $1.4 billion a year. Strict quotas on cheaper foreign sugar maintain the support price levels, which critics say benefit a small number of wealthy plantation owners and encourage overproduction in environmentally sensitive areas like the Florida Everglades."
<p>
But Schmitt was the exception among national reporters. Most reporters chose to challenge neither Clinton nor Republicans on why they maintain a subsidy that hurts consumers, taxpayers, and the environment.

<title>Issue Analysis: Networks Report Only One Side of Employment Picture</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Media Lay Off New Jobs Story</h2>
</center>
<p>
Most economists argue that layoffs and a certain amount of job insecurity are part of a healthy, competitive economy. Joseph Schumpeter labeled the process of new technologies replacing workers and new companies displacing established companies "creative destruction." While such a competitive economy isn't always pleasant for those who are temporarily out of work, most economists say it undeniably creates a more prosperous economy for all.
<p>
But most economists are never interviewed by network news reporters. The result is that, for the most part, viewers are told only about the destructiveness of a competitive economy and not job creation. Media Research Center analysts reviewed every story about employment on network evening news shows (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, CNN's World News, and NBC Nightly News) during January and February. Of the 21 stories, 19 focused on corporate layoffs and downsizing. Only two highlighted parts of the economy where jobs are plentiful. And while there were eleven soundbites from politicians, there was only one soundbite from an economist.
<p>
Tom Brokaw, on the January 29 Nightly News, expressed the typical tone. Introducing a story about "today's frightening job market," he said, "Job security is a thing of the past now and the way of the future is downsizing and layoffs, even for America's biggest companies. It's making for serious anxiety. A recent poll in New York state shows a third of the workers fearful they or someone in their household will lose their job, and soon. And with good reason. Last year there were more than 400,000 announced layoffs across the country, bringing the three-year total to 1.5 million."
<p>
Dan Rather, on the February 22 CBS Evening News, gave a similar diagnosis: "Millions of American workers know it. Despite soaring profits and a record Wall Street, U.S. businesses are still cutting good jobs and barely raising wages." According to Rather, "Republican Pat Buchanan has hit a nerve with his rhetoric about this. He is connecting with real anger and fear in the workplace."
<p>
CBS's Wyatt Andrews, on that same broadcast, described "an increasingly anxious middle class, whose dreams of upward mobility have met a downward reality." NBC's Mike Jensen, on the January 4 Nightly News, declared that "as for the future, American companies are locked on a new course. Layoffs and firings are no longer something they do only in a recession. Instead, they're business as usual."
<p>
AT&T's announcement that it would lay off 40,000 workers prompted many of the gloomy jobs stories. According to CNN's Kathleen Kennedy, on the January 3 World News, "The latest rounds of corporate cutbacks have left many people fearing that they may be the next to be fired. AT&T announced that it was cutting 40,000 jobs." On January 2 Brokaw announced that "if what happened today to 40,000 workers at AT&T is any kind of barometer of what's ahead, it will be another long, anxious year for the American middle class."
<p>
But neither followed up on the AT&T workers. Like almost all of the other reports about the country's job picture, they ignored the parts of the economy which are generating jobs. T.J. Rogers of Cypress Semiconductor, in the March 12 Wall Street Journal, argued that "for the past decade or more, jobs have been migrating to smaller, more nimble, entrepreneurial companies from the Fortune 500 as those companies streamline and lose employment. This trend strengthens our economy, but it has created a short-term fear for their jobs among Americans."
<p>
According to Rogers: "What is not publicized is that my company has already hired some of those [laid-off] AT&T people. And our rival, Cirrus Logic, beat us to the punch in starting up a design center in South Carolina to take advantage of hiring those ex-AT&T engineers. The bad news from big companies gets front-page coverage, but the near-immediate absorption of their skilled workers is rarely discussed."
<p>
Similarly, economics columnist Robert Samuelson noted in the March 13 Washington Post that most laid-off workers find valuable employment elsewhere. "Among rehired workers," Samuelson wrote, "the Labor Department reports as follows: 27 percent got wages at least 20 percent higher than at their previous jobs; 26 percent got wages up to 20 percent higher; 16 percent suffered a pay loss no greater than 20 percent; and 31 percent suffered pay losses of more than 20 percent.
<p>
And American Enterprise Institute economist Herbert Stein pointed out in the March 14 Wall Street Journal that "in 1995, on average, 5.6 percent of the civilian labor force was unemployed. In the previous 20 years the rate had been lower than that in only three years." According to Stein, "The highly publicized layoffs by large corporations were a tiny fraction of the labor force and a small fraction of the number of people who enter or leave employment each year."
<p>
Stein also wrote that "concern with insecurity ought to be evident in real behavior." He noted that people didn't change their smoking or drinking behavior until they became seriously concerned with health or their social behavior until they became seriously concerned about crime. "If people were seriously concerned about their economic condition one might expect them to save more, but they don't." He noted that people are not retiring later, a trend that would be expected if workers felt financially insecure.
<p>
But good business news is rarely news. Only two network news reports focused on the country's enormous job growth. One was by Wyatt Andrews for the February 6 CBS Evening News. Andrews reported that some companies which laid off workers over the past few years have started rehiring. "The era of layoffs in America is not over," Andrews told viewers, "but there is a countertrend going on. In the latest polls, most American managers now admit they fired too many people...and that growth, including the hiring of new workers, is the only way to survive."
<p>
The other was by NBC's Linda Vester on the January 26 Nightly News. "From small machine shops to giant auto plants," Vester reported, "the manufacturing industry is in dire need of the best and the brightest." She said that many manufacturers cannot find enough skilled workers and are even employing headhunters to recruit them. Vester told viewers that "according to one study more than half of America's manufacturers say they're having trouble finding qualified people." She pointed out that people seeking to meet the demand are enrolling at vocational schools. Vester was the only reporter to interview an economist about the country's job picture.
<p>
But Vester was an exception. For most of her colleagues, two things still stand in the way of presenting their viewers with an accurate picture of the economy: The overwhelming preference they have for interviewing politicians instead of economists and their obsession with bad -- and only bad -- business news.

<center><h2>Kudos: Tim Russert</h2>
</center>
<p>
It's not very often that a network journalist talks about the positive effects of business competition and stock market growth for workers and for Main Street America. Usually, only the victims of business competition are presented to viewers and those who gain from the stock market are portrayed as greedy. The unorthodox presidential candidacy of  Republican Pat Buchanan has caused some reporters to challenge such conventional wisdom.
<p>
Case-in-point: NBC's Tim Russert on the March 3 Meet the Press. Russert challenged Buchanan's protectionist trade views by asking the candidate: "Hasn't the [foreign] competition, in fact been good for GM and Ford? Taurus is now the number one car. American cars are better because the American people opted to buy Japanese cars because the quality was better and forced American automobile manufacturers to make their cars better."
<p>
Then Russert pointed out how important the stock market is to workers. "I've talked to a lot of people in large corporations and on Wall Street over the last week," he said, "and they tell me that if your trade policies were put in place and your economic program was put in place, it would be a shock to the stock market, that the market would collapse perhaps as much as 20 percent. And they reminded me of something I'm not even sure you're aware of. Do you know what percent of the stock market is pension money? It's a third. Fifty four million people have fully-funded pensions in this country... And Mr. Buchanan, if that market was rattled by your economic policies, pensioners could lose a half billion dollars and their security is threatened."
<p>
When most reporters challenge candidates' economic policies, they do so from the left. Kudos to Russert for challenging Buchanan from the right.

<center><h2>Flat-Tax Flip-Floppers</h2>
</center>
<p>
One of the most remarkable things about the recent rise in popularity of the flat tax is the way leading newspapers and magazines that previously supported the idea have suddenly turned against it. In particular, the New York Times and Washington Post had previously editorialized in favor of the flat tax, but now both oppose the idea.
<p>
For example, in an April 15, 1982 editorial, the Post said, "The ideal income tax would be a flat percentage of all income above an arbitrary threshold of, say, $10,000 per year." It concluded that the flat tax "is the obvious remedy" to the problems of the tax system.
<p>
On June 3, 1982 the Post reiterated its support. "Replacing the [tax] system with a low-rate tax on income -- with few, if any, exclusions allowed -- is an idea that, by promising efficiency, equity and simplicity, appeals to all parts of the political spectrum," it said.
<p>
Fourteen years later, however, the Post is now opposed to what it had earlier supported. On January 19, the Post called the flat tax "a flawed idea, less a serious tax proposal than a slogan in the name of which the advocates claim to be able to accomplish several things at once." It concluded that the flat tax "wouldn't be an improvement." 
<p>
Back in 1982 the New York Times supported the flat tax. In a June 6, 1982 editorial, the Times favored "a flat-rate tax levied on a greatly broadened income base." It even praised Senator Jesse Helms's proposed 12 percent flat-rate tax.
<p>
As recently as 1992 the Times reiterated its support for the flat tax. In a March 27, 1992 editorial the Times explicitly endorsed the Hall-Rabushka plan upon which the Armey and Forbes plans are based. It called the flat tax "a superb idea."
<p>
But like the Post, the Times now opposes a flat tax. In a January 18, 1996 editorial the Times found "a glaring fault" in the flat tax. Like Claude Rains in Casablanca, the Times is now shocked, shocked to discover that the flat tax will benefit the wealthy! It concluded by denouncing the Forbes plan.
<p>
<%-2>Individual reporters have also flip-flopped on the flat tax. For example, <BI>Business Week<D>'s <B>Chris Farrell<D> thought the flat tax was great in a January 9, 1995 column. "If Washington legislators truly want to make a difference, they should...embrace a flat tax," he wrote. The Armey plan "makes sense  -- far more than any other reform being considered. Limiting exemptions and deductions would lower the tax rate by broadening the tax base. And the change would encourage a more efficient allocation of resources."<BI%0>
<p>
But like the Post and the Times, Farrell has suddenly decided that the flat tax is too risky. In a February 19, 1996 column, Farrell said flat-tax advocates are wrong. "Their florid rhetoric vastly overstates the economic gains and deeply understates the risks," he wrote. "The gains could be easily dwarfed by wrenching business and household upheavals as America shifts to a new tax code. Indeed, the transition to a flat tax is fraught with danger -- so much so that the long- term payoff may never come." According to Farrell, the stock market, home prices, and consumer spending all would collapse under a flat tax.
<p>
Such predictions can only be described as total nonsense. As Professor Glenn Hubbard of Columbia University points out, the magnitude of tax changes under a flat tax would be no greater than what we experienced in 1981 and 1986. And the impact on financial markets would be no greater than those experienced many times in the postwar era, when interest rates either rose or fell sharply. Moreover, there is no question that a flat tax will cause the stock market to rise, not fall.
<p>
Unfortunately, the ranks of those who have switched gears on the flat tax include conservatives. As a columnist, Pat Buchanan strongly supported Armey's flat-tax proposal. However, as a presidential candidate, Buchanan opposes it. In a January 27, 1996 article in the New York Times, Buchanan called the flat tax "simplistic" and attacked it for cutting the taxes of the rich. No wonder the Times published it.
<p>
<%-2>Of course, everyone has the right -- indeed, the obligation -- to reconsider their positions when con- fronted with new information. But when major newspapers and prominent writers switch their positions 180 degrees on a major issue, especially within a short period of time, readers are entitled to an explanation. Otherwise, they can only assume that prevailing fashion dictates editorial views, rather than facts and analysis, and that such views aren't worthy of serious consideration.<%0>

<TITLE>New Show Continues Prime Time Tradition of Business Bashing</TITLE>

<h2><center>New Show Continues Prime Time Tradition of Business Bashing</h2>
<p>
<h3>Fox's Profit Motive</h3></center>
<p>
Profit, a new prime time show on Fox, starts from a unique premise. Far from being the sympathetic hero, Jim Profit, the main character whose voice narrates the show, is a villain. Viewers naturally root against, rather than for, the show's namesake. This is new, different, and daring, and it makes for entertaining television. But in another way, Profit is anything but new. As is so often the case on TV, the villain is a corporate executive. 
Jim Profit, in fact, is a supervillain gone berserk. In the show's premiere  episode, which aired April 8, Profit is shown to be a relentless climber at Gracen & Gracen (G&G), the company where he is a vice president. He uses confidential information to blackmail a decent secretary into sabotaging her equally decent boss, whose job Profit covets. When the secretary later comes to work for Profit, he says: "It's good to see Gail understands the basic nature of business. We adapt or pay the price."
<p>
He uses other ruthless means to weed out those in his way. He frames a female vice president for the blackmail of the secretary, getting her fired. He seduces the wife of another vice president, and then masterminds a plan to make it look like she's sleeping with G&G's CEO. When her husband beats up the CEO (who, by the way, does pick a new mistress every year), he gets fired. And viewers find out that Profit became a vice president in the first place by inducing a heart attack in the vice president above him.
How did profit become so evil? Late in the premiere, viewers learn that as a child Profit was forced by his father to live in a cardboard box and spent all his time watching television through a hole cut out of the box. Profit tracks down his father, kills him, and threatens to frame his stepmother if she turns him in or tries to thwart his business plans.
<p>
The appearance of the show has rekindled a long-running debate about Hollywood's portrayal of business. The experts' conventional wisdom: the greedy scoundrels are getting what they deserve. Graef Crystal, a psychologist and compensation expert, told USA Today that employees "can't take out [their] rage on the CEO -- that person is too powerful. You probably can't even talk to the press for fear of losing your job. But a show that makes you say 'yes, that's exactly what it's like' will hold your attention." 
<p>
Alan Merten, dean of Cornell University's Johnson Graduate School of Management, also pinned the blame on the business world. He told USA Today that corporate executives "should look at this trend and realize that whatever their financial motives, their actions aren't playing well in Peoria. The timing of some large layoffs and big [executive] bonus packages has been terrible."
<p>
Perhaps. But Hollywood's business bashing isn't, as Merten suggests, a new trend; it's an institution. The show Dallas was popular long before the current wave of layoffs and in a 1992 Media Research Center study of entertainment programming, businessmen were 43 percent of the criminals, far more than lawyers, politicians, or any other profession. Even, in the past, when there have been positive business characters, such as the business owners on Designing Women, they haven't been positive because of their business. By contrast, there were evil lawyers on L.A. Law, but also lawyers who benefited society because of the work they did.
<p>
A more likely explanation for Hollywood's continued business bashing is that entertainment television writers still hold to an ideology which cannot conceive of business as an honorable calling that serves society by producing goods, services, wealth, and jobs. Profit, to them, seems to be a four-letter word.

<center><h2>Kudos: Time's Branegan and CBS's Brady</h2></center>
<p>
With job insecurity garnering headlines in the U.S. and many demanding that the government "do something" about it, few reporters have looked overseas to see what happens when governments try. Time's Jay Branegan did. According to Branegan, in the April 15 issue, "The rich benefits that have made Europe a sweet place to work have clogged its economic arteries. Call it Eurosclerosis -- the combination of a staggering tax burden and a blanket of regulations that smother new businesses and entrepreneurship."
<p>
Branegan's evidence: "Europe's unemployment rate of 11 percent is twice as high as the U.S.'s, and its job creation chart is a flat line. Over the past three years, the U.S. has created 8.4 million new jobs, Europe none. Significantly, many of those new American jobs pay higher than average wages, and as many as 60 percent are managerial or professional." Branegan also pointed out that high minimum-wage laws in such countries as France mean "many [Frenchmen] aren't working at all. Joblessness among young people, hit hardest by minimum-wage laws, is roughly twice France's overall unemployment rate of nearly 12 percent." Something for reporters to keep in mind as American politicians debate raising the U.S. minimum wage.
<p>
On the March 26 CBS Evening News, correspondent Ray Brady reported on one form of government spending that has largely escaped the budget ax -- corporate welfare. Specifically, Brady looked at federal subsidies for ethanol. According to Brady, "Critics, even those within the U.S. government, say the virtues of ethanol are way overstated. At a time when the government is cutting on social programs, they question why it's still handing out subsidies to the ethanol industry, subsidies that amount to nearly $800 million a year."
<p>
Brady recounted how "ethanol was born of desperation during the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, when gasoline prices soared and lines pressed for miles. But now gasoline is plentiful, much cheaper to produce than ethanol. And today, ethanol accounts for just over one percent of all U.S. energy consumption." And while "ethanol does reduce some pollutants, the Congressional Budget Office says it contributes to others, such as ozone pollution."
<p>
Why, then, does the subsidy continue? "Many point to the lobbying of corn growers and generous political donations to both parties by Archer Daniels Midland, the world's largest producer of ethanol, and a major beneficiary of the government's subsidies." According to Brady, the ethanol industry has "racked up $6 billion in subsidies, courtesy of the American taxpayer."
<p>
Kudos to Branegan and Brady for practicing journalism at its best, with Branegan looking at the results of programs politicians are proposing and with Brady questioning programs neither political party wants questioned.

<p>
<h3>Privatized Paupers? No</h3>
</center>
<p>
On March 11 and 12, the CBS Evening News broadcast a two-part "Eye on America" segment by Ray Brady focusing on Social Security privatization. What started out as a compelling case for reform of the soon-to-be bankrupt pension program ended up as a broadside attack against the most promising reform -- privatization.
<p>
First, the background. Social Security now has an unfunded long-term liability of more than $5 trillion -- which exceeds the entire national debt. In 35 years, the system will be financially insolvent. Kaput. As CBS rightly pointed out, in 1950 there were 17 workers for every retired person. Today there are three; by 2030 there will be just two. To keep the system solvent at current benefit levels would require the tax rate to rise from 15 percent to as much as 30 percent. If there were ever a program that needed major reform, it is this one.
<p>
CBS discussed one potential way out of the box: to privatize the system and allow individual workers to place their payroll tax dollars into a personalized account, like an expanded IRA. Under rules established by the government, workers could invest this money in mutual funds and other investments. Brady interviewed Jose Pinera, the former economic minister of Chile, where privatization was adopted some 15 years ago. The results there have been remarkably successful. Chilean workers are now receiving a 13 percent annual rate of return on their Social Security investments.
<p>
Brady then cited a Cato Institute study documenting that in the United States, if a low-income worker were permitted to place his payroll taxes into an IRA, and that worker earned just the average rate of return on stocks and bonds since 1946, that worker would receive a benefit of $1,650 more per month from the IRA than under Social Security. As one of the editors of that study, I can attest that the results were reviewed by well-respected actuaries who found no fault with the methodology.
<p>
Brady, however, launched an attack against privatization by arguing that the Cato study made "dangerously optimistic assumptions." The "dangerously optimistic assumption" was that over the next 50 years investors will yield roughly the same average real rate of return in stocks and bonds as was recorded by financial markets over the past 50 years. No one knows for sure whether the markets will perform better or worse. Still, it is worth noting that over the past several years the stock market has substantially outperformed the average rate of return since 1945.
<p>
Then CBS rolled out objections to the plan, such as claims that the plan only works if "workers work their whole lifetime in a boom stock market." This is patently false. If we had a boom market for the next 50 years, and we privatized Social Security, most American workers would be millionaire pensioners when they retired. But even if workers placed all of their payroll tax into low-risk, low-return bonds, privatization is still a very good deal for workers of all incomes, vis-a-vis a non-privatized system.
<p>
The CBS report saved its heavy artillery for last. Brady said that instead of "making educated guesses about the future, like the proponents of privatization, we took a look at how a Social Security stock plan would have performed using real data from the past." (Note the false inference here, that the Cato Institute study did not "use real data from the past.") "Using an independent firm," CBS reported that a wealthy worker would get $30,000 more under privatization, but a low-income worker would get $13,000 less. Conclusion: privatization is unfair.
<p>
Just how were those numbers derived? Alas, we will never know. After repeated requests for the methodology, CBS has refused to reveal what firm produced them, what actuarial assumptions were used, and any other information about the results. While CBS was quick to attack privatization advocates for using "dangerous assumptions," that charge can't be made against CBS; the company won't tell us what their assumptions were. For all we know, the numbers were simply made up out of thin air.
<p>
Finally, CBS concluded that most Americans oppose Social Security privatization. How should the system be fixed, then? "Cut benefits and raise Social Security taxes." Two problems here. First, virtually every poll over the past ten years shows that raising the payroll tax is by far the least popular "fix" to the Social Security system. Second, raising the tax level and reducing the promised benefit make Social Security an even worse deal than it already is for young workers. Now they would have to pay more in for a lower benefit. What a deal! If we "reformed" Social Security in the way CBS suggests, privatization would be manifoldly more attractive to workers. Was this taken into account when CBS said low-income workers would be worse off under privatization?
<p>
Social Security reform is perhaps the single most important issue to young workers in America. What is needed is a careful, balanced, and reasoned presentation of the options. Too bad Ray Brady and CBS failed to provide it.

<Title>Issue Analysis: Income Stories Ignore Total Compensation</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Issue Analysis: Income Stories Ignore Total Compensation</h2>
<p>
<h3>Network Reporting a Slave to Wages</h3>
</center>
<p>
Last month, MediaNomics reported that there were 19 stories about layoffs during the first two months of 1996, but only two stories about job growth. We noted how such a focus on the negative offered a distorted picture of the true nature of a competitive economy, which does destroy some jobs, but always creates more jobs.
<p>
The sister issue to job creation is living standards. A competitive economy would be of little benefit to workers if it caused their standard of living to decrease. Media Research Center analysts reviewed every story that focused on wages and incomes on network morning and evening shows during the first three months of 1996. Ten of the 11 stories stressed the alleged wage stagnation of average workers over the last few decades. Only one story pointed out that opportunities have been increasing. No story pointed out that when benefits and payroll taxes are included, workers' total compensation has been steadily increasing.
<p>
A lack of diversity in guest selection kept the morning shows from giving viewers a balanced story. For instance, on the March 12 Today, Bryant Gumbel interviewed only Jared Bernstein of the liberal Economic Policy Institute. Introducing the segment, Gumbel pointed out that the U.S. economy has created eight million new jobs over the last three years, adding that "the quantity of jobs is not being questioned, but the quality is."
<p>
Bernstein then said that "wages and compensation have been falling in our labor market since 1979 for most workers. yet in the current economy, profit rates, or corporate profits, are at a 30-year high." Bernstein also claimed that "this is a long-term trend and workers are experiencing falling wages and compensation and even increased turnover. That is, we have less stable employment and the typical American family is really running faster just to stay in place."
<p>
Gumbel's reaction: "OK, so let us accept all of that as fact. Could it be otherwise?" Since Gumbel didn't provide an alternative opinion, viewers had no choice but to accept Bernstein's assertions as fact.
<p>
Other reporters also seemed to assume that accounts of workers' falling wages was a fact. On the February 26 CBS Evening News, Dan Rather concluded that "the fear and anger of some American workers over layoffs and barely rising wages have emerged as a campaign issue." Earlier, on the February 22 CBS Evening News, Rather said: "Millions of American workers know it. Despite soaring profits and a record Wall Street, U.S. businesses are still cutting good jobs and barely raising wages."
<p>
On that same broadcast, correspondent Wyatt Andrews portrayed "an increasingly anxious middle class, whose dreams of upward mobility have met a downward reality." According to NBC's Mike Jensen, on the March 4 Nightly News, "William Young of California is typical -- 50, a victim of downsizing, laid off by Northrup after 29 years in the aerospace industry."
<p>
On the February 25 World News Sunday, ABC's Jeff Greenfield, normally one of the most balanced reporters at the networks, also bought the party line. He reported "something very disturbing behind the record Wall Street numbers and corporate profits." He interviewed a Wall Street economist who said, "This surge in financial markets was really based on an untenable situation of workers taking a real squeeze in living standards to improve corporate profit margins and competitive prowess." Greenfield called this the "dark side of productivity."
<p>
But just how dark is the American wage and income picture? According to Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas economists W. Michael Cox and Beverly J. Fox, writing in a January National Center for Policy Analysis Policy Backgrounder, it's not as bad as many have been led to believe. The problem with most analyses of stagnating wages is they don't look at benefits. Cox and Fox pointed out that "employee benefits have grown from 20 percent of payroll in 1953 to more than 41 percent today." Since benefits aren't taxed, they argue, employees have sought benefit increases. Increasing payroll taxes have also taken a bite out of wages.
<p>
Cox and Fox also maintain that looking at stagnating household income, as Bernstein apparently was, is misleading. "Today's households are nearly 15 percent smaller than they were in the 1970s -- so household income is spread over fewer people," they report. "The median family income statistics for yesterday's Brady Bunch cannot be accurately compared with those of today's Murphy Brown." Overall, Cox and Fox demonstrate that "per capita real personal income increased an average of 1.4 percent a year" from 1974 through 1993. Unfortunately neither they nor like-minded economists were interviewed by network reporters.
<p>
Only NBC's Jim Avila, on the March 4 Nightly News, gave any hint that the job and wage picture for American workers was not completely bleak. Though he didn't point out that total compensation has been increasing for American workers over the last few decades, he did look at small businesses creating jobs and noted that "many of the new jobs being created provide good salaries, full benefits, and something some of the old jobs did not provide -- a piece of the action. Often small companies offer new employees stock options and other incentives." According to Avila, "The workplace has changed, perhaps forever. The job security of the past replaced by uncertainty and, more often than you might think, also replaced by new opportunity." But, of course, Avila was the exception.

<center><h2>Reporters Ignore Past Prices, Government Burden</center></h2>
<p>
<center><h3>Networks Pump Up Gas-Price Story</center></h3>
<p>
Given how closely tuned the media antennae are to the political world, it's no surprise that the recent bump in gasoline prices was big news. Politicians in both parties tried to make political hay out of the price increase. Few reporters questioned their rhetoric by pointing out that gas prices, by historical standards, are not high and that they would be even lower if it weren't for taxes and regulations.
<p>
CBS saw a capitalist conspiracy behind the price hike. Dan Rather sounded the alarm on the April 30 CBS Evening News: "It's the question every American driver is asking with every trip to the pump. Why is the price of gasoline going up and up and up? Is it the free market at work, the law of supply and demand? Or, is it greed, or possibly even something more sinister?"
<p>
CBS economics correspondent Ray Brady suspected the latter. After an industry soundbite defending the price hikes, Brady reported that "critics say those high pump prices come from gouging, [that] the industry deliberately let supplies drop." Brady also blamed Americans for "driving longer distances to work in popular gas guzzlers. And speeding; no more 55-mile-an-hour federal speed limit."
<p>
Curiously, in the very next story, CBS didn't hint at conspiracy when Clinton moved to keep beef prices high. According to Rather, "President Clinton is giving some election-year help to America's ranchers and farmers. The President took action today to try to boost cattle prices, which have fallen to their lowest level in ten years."
<p>
The other networks were a little more calm about the gasoline price hike. ABC's Brian Rooney, on the April 24 World News Tonight, blamed "a combination of unrelated events" for the higher gasoline prices. Rooney pointed out that "crude oil traders were predicting that the United Nations would partially lift the ban on Iraqi oil, which would have put more and cheaper oil on the market. When that didn't happen, the rush to buy from other sources drove the price up." Rooney also informed viewers that the long Northeastern winter contributed to the higher prices.
<p>
Over at NBC, Tom Brokaw said, on the April 30 Nightly News: "We don't have to tell you tonight that gas prices are still stuck at very high levels." Of the government investigation, correspondent Pete Williams said: "Some government economists are skeptical the investigation will turn up anything illegal." He also pinned blame on the weather: "They say prices are up because the severe storm from last winter drove up demand for heating oil, leaving less crude oil for making gasoline."
<p>
Rooney and Williams were correct, as far as they went. But were gas price really "at very high levels"? John Merline, in the May 7 Investor's Business Daily, looked at history for an answer. "After controlling for inflation," he reported, "a gallon of gas today costs 27 percent less than it did in 1949, and 23 percent less than a gallon did as recently as 1985." He pointed out that "even at the high pump prices posted at the end of April, the average national gasoline price is about the same as it was in June of last year."
<p>
Merline spotted the real story, that "today's prices would be lower still were it not for the substantial added cost imposed by government." Neither Brady, Rooney, or Williams mentioned, as Merline did, that "today, the combined federal-state tax is 37 cents a gallon. The federal tax stands at 18 cents a gallon, and the median state tax is 19 cents." 
<p>
"At today's prices," he added, "taxes alone account for more than a quarter of the pump price." Merline also explained that government regulations raise the price of gasoline at least four cents a gallon.
<p>
While Rooney and Williams at least didn't get the story wrong, they still didn't get the full story. Many network news viewers still may not know how much government adds to the price of gasoline.

<center><h2>Kudos</center></h2>
<p>
What would someone with one foot in the civil rights community and one in the business world think about proposals to raise the minimum wage? Reporter Michael Winsop, in the May 10 New York Times, sought to answer that question. He interviewed Robert Bobbitt, Sr., past president of the board of the Canton, Ohio Urban League and now an owner of four McDonald's franchises in Canton's suburbs.
<p>
Winsop explained that "being the boss changed Mr. Bobbitt's politics. Nearly a decade ago he began voting Republican. The Democrat's current push in Washington to raise the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour from $4.25 illustrates why." According to Bobbitt, "Before, I would have thought of the minimum wage as a social issue. Then you start working for yourself, and all the risk and responsibilities are on you."
<p>
Winsop told how Bobbitt and another businessman went to see their Congressman. "They explained that 60 percent to 70 percent of their employees were suburban teenagers, many living at home and working to pay for a car and insurance."
<p>
In the May 5 Washington Post, staff writer Steven Pearlstein poked holes in the conventional wisdom about falling wages. Pointing to studies showing falling wages, he wrote that "by measuring only cash wages, the median wage series ignores the fact that employees have been receiving a greater share of their compensation in the form of tax-free fringe benefits." According to Pearlstein, "Most economists now agree that the government's main inflation gauge, the consumer price index, overstates the rise in the cost of living. And because income data are adjusted by the CPI, the effect of overstating inflation is to understate income."
<p>
Kudos to Winsop and Pearlstein for showing underreported sides of economic stories.

<title>Guest Editorial, by Lawrence Hunter</title>

<center><h2>Guest Editorial, by Lawrence Hunter</h2></center>
<center><h3>Easy Money for Trial Lawyers</h3></center>

Time Warner's Money magazine claims to be a publication for serious investors. 
But lately Money seems to be fronting for an unholy alliance of anti-business 
activist Ralph Nader and a small group of the nation's most predatory trial 
lawyers. While dozens of liberal Democrats joined Republicans last December in 
passing securities litigation reform legislation in the only override of a 
Clinton veto, Money aligned itself with Nader's camp against the popular reform 
bill.
<p>
For years, "strike suit" securities lawyers have reaped lavish incomes 
targeting advanced technology and other growth companies. When stock prices 
drop suddenly, the lawyers typically swoop down and extract multimillion-dollar 
settlements. The system has made it so costly for companies to defend 
themselves against baseless charges that many are forced to settle out of 
court.
<p>
Over the past four years, settlements in such suits have cost investors more 
than $2.5 billion, one third of which -- $825 million -- went straight into the 
pockets of the "strike suit" lawyers.
<p>
The securities bar helped finance Ralph Nader's high-profile campaign against 
the federal legislation to curb abusive securities suits. Then President 
Clinton -- whose career has been largely financed by trial lawyers' largesse -- 
vetoed the legislation.
<p>
Scores of liberal Democrats, including Sen. Edward Kennedy, Democratic National 
Committee Chairman Sen. Chris Dodd, and California Rep. Vic Fazio, joined 
Republicans to override the veto. They found support in much of the media, 
including a Washington Post editorial charging Clinton had "caved to the trial 
lawyers' lobby."
<p>
But Nader, President Clinton, and the trial lawyers had a reliable ally in 
Money magazine. Money's coverage was brazenly one-sided. In four of the five 
monthly editions preceding passage of the bill, managing editor Frank Lalli 
used his column to inveigh against the legislation. Money's fixation is all the 
more notable because Lalli's column is the only opinion piece each month. The 
magazine even ginned up a letter-writing campaign in support of a veto.
During the year of congressional debate on the bill, Money published no 
information about the benefits of the legislation, just Lalli's opinions.
<p>
Month after month, Money's opinion campaign broke the rules of honest advocacy. 
Persistently, the magazine published false or misleading characterizations of 
the reform bill. For instance:
Money falsely charged that the bill would "allow executives to deliberately 
lie." In fact, the bill specifically outlaws executives from making knowingly 
fraudulent statements. The bill does create a limited "safe harbor" for 
good-faith disclosure of forward-looking financial information. A Washington 
Post editorial praised the "safe harbor" for shielding companies "from a style 
of legal assault that is not far from extortion."
<p>
Money wrongly complained that "investors who sue and lose could be forced to 
pay the winner's court costs." The bill does not impose a "loser pays" or "fee 
shifting" provision. Instead it takes a modest step to toughen existing federal 
rules against frivolous claims, whether they are made by the plaintiff or 
defendant.
<p>
Money put things completely backwards in saying "accountants who okay 
fraudulent books will get protection." In fact, the bill gives the Securities 
and Exchange Commission new power to act against accountants, lawyers, and 
others who assist securities fraud.
<p>
The magazine refused to publish letters to the editor in support of the reform 
bill. It is unclear why a publication that professes to be a serious investors' 
magazine allowed only one side's arguments to be heard on an important issue 
for investors. Whatever the motive may be, surely it is not a serious search 
for the truth.
<p>
Securities litigation reform remains a hot political item. Securities lawyers 
are spending millions of dollars on a California ballot initiative that would 
effectively negate the new federal reform law's effect in that state and across 
the nation. Ralph Nader is campaigning ardently for the trial lawyers' 
initiative.
<p>
Those who keep Money magazine in business should take serious stock of its 
editorial policies and practices. Time Warner shareholders and executives -- 
and Money's readers and advertisers -- are in the best position to decide what 
editorial opinions on public policies best reflect their values. But clearly 
everyone is done a disservice when a publication attempts to justify its 
editorial opinion through falsehood and distortion.

the Congressional Joint Economic Committee.

<title>Issue Analysis: Reporters Miss Important Angles of Debate</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>

<center><h2>Issue Analysis: Reporters Miss Important Angles of 
Debate</h2></center>
<center><h3>Minimum Depth on Minimum Wage</h3></center>

One of the key debates currently defining the differences between Republicans 
and Democrats is the argument over efforts to raise the minimum wage. Democrats 
argue that the government can legislate higher pay for those earning the 
minimum wage without harming anyone. Republicans, on the other hand, argue that 
by artificially raising wages, the government will cause employers to lay off 
workers.
<p>
On which side did the media weigh in? Media Research Center analysts reviewed 
all of the minimum wage stories on evening news shows (ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC) and 
morning news shows (ABC, CBS, NBC). There were 36 stories and anchor reads 
about the debate. With a few exceptions, the networks took the side of those 
supporting a minimum-wage increase. For example:
Soundbite sources were almost twice as likely to be supporters of the 
minimum-wage increase than opponents. Out of 60 soundbite sources, 39 supported 
the minimum-wage increase, while only 21 were opposed to it. Several stories 
contained soundbites only from Democrats and their allies.
<p>
Bob Schieffer's April 25 CBS Evening News report, for instance, had soundbites 
from Democrats Maxine Waters, Ted Kennedy, Al Gore, and two minimum wage 
workers whom the Democrats had brought to Washington for a news conference. 
"Democrats will keep the pressure up," Schieffer said. "They believe that 
Republicans are taking such a pounding on this they'll eventually allow a 
vote." He didn't tell viewers what Republicans believed.
<p>
This emphasis on supporters of the minimum-wage hike led some reporters to 
accept the Democrats' opinion that the wage could be increased without harming 
workers. According to NBC's Lisa Myers, on the April 17 Nightly News, a 
minimum-wage increase would be "good news for about 10 million workers now 
earning near the minimum wage of $4.25 an hour, frozen since 1989." CNN's 
Kathleen Kennedy, on the April 24 The World Tonight, worried that "people 
earning the minimum wage may not get a raise anytime soon. Despite political 
pressure from both parties, House Republican leaders Newt Gingrich and Dick 
Armey have virtually ruled out scheduling a vote on the minimum-wage increase."
The political horse-race aspect of the debate was emphasized far more than the 
economics of the debate. There were only three soundbites from economists; 
there were 46 soundbites from politicians. The networks were much more 
interested in who would win and lose politically from the debate than what the 
effect would be on the country. According to NBC's Tom Brokaw, on the April 17 
Nightly News, it was likely that "the most basic wage in this country affecting 
millions of workers and businesses will go up. But, who gets the credit?"
<p>
This weighed heavily on the minds of other reporters, as well. NBC's Jim 
Miklaszewski, on the April 24 Nightly News, predicted that "by digging in their 
heels, Republicans may also be digging themselves into a political hole." And 
ABC's Cokie Roberts, on the April 23 Good Morning America, said: "If the 
Republicans are stuck going along, then they want to get some credit."
Journalists were more interested in interviewing other journalists than in 
interviewing economists. The obsession with political angles reached almost 
comic proportions at times. On the morning shows, where live interviews are 
common, there were five such interviews of journalists about the minimum wage, 
but none with economists.
<p>
ABC's Willow Bay interviewed ABC's Sam Donaldson on a Good Morning America 
Sunday segment. ABC's Charles Gibson interviewed ABC's Cokie Roberts and ABC's 
Tyler Mathison on a Good Morning America segment. NBC's Bryant Gumbel 
interviewed NBC's Tim Russert on a Today segment. And CBS's Harry Smith 
interviewed The Weekly Standard's Fred Barnes. None of these shows were 
interested in the insights of economists, however.
<p>
There was more skepticism of Republican motives than Democratic motives. Three 
stories suggested that Republicans opposed raising the minimum wage because 
their business allies opposed it. ABC's Carole Simpson, on the April 28 World 
News Sunday, reported that Republicans "say [a minimum-wage hike] is bad for 
small business." According to Bob Schieffer, on the April 17 CBS Evening News, 
Republicans "know polls show most Americans favor an increase, but many of 
their business allies oppose it." Neither Simpson or Schieffer suggested that 
Republicans may oppose an increase because it would hurt workers.
<p>
No reporter made the analogous charge against Democrats, that they support the 
increase simply because their labor allies support it. NBC's Jim Miklaszewski, 
on the April 25 Today, did at least state that there was a principle at stake 
for the GOP: "They can stand their ground on principle on this issue, but lose 
ground in public opinion." He did not explain what that principle was, though.
The one study of the impact of minimum wage increases cited by reporters is one 
most economists disavow. The infamous Card-Krueger study, named after the two 
economists who directed it, was mentioned favorably in two stories. Card and 
Krueger looked at the impact of a minimum-wage increase in New Jersey, compared 
to neighboring Pennsylvania, which hadn't increased its state minimum wage. 
They found that there was no job loss in New Jersey due to the increase. Since 
this is one of the only studies to produce such a finding, it is often cited by 
advocates of increasing the minimum wage.
<p>
ABC's Tyler Mathison mentioned the study on the April 23 Good Morning America. 
NBC's Mike Jensen also mentioned it favorably on the April 26 Nightly News. 
Neither of them mentioned the well-publicized problems many economists found 
with the study's methodology. Jensen, in fact, used a soundbite from one of the 
study's chief critics, economist Richard Berman, but didn't mention his 
criticisms of the study. He even employed an Alan Krueger soundbite to refute 
Berman.
<p>
There were exceptions to the biased coverage. ABC's Bob Zelnick, on the April 
24 Good Morning America, pointed out that "if labor costs rise too much, many 
employers might simply fire workers or cut back on new hires." And while 
journalists usually don't bother to interview small-business owners about how 
political policies will affect them, several did interview them about the 
minimum wage. NBC's Tom Brokaw devoted an entire Nightly News segment to the 
concerns of a small business owner "in his own words."
<p>
By far the best interview segment about the minimum wage was Anthony Mason's 
interview of Republican Senator Don Nickles and Democratic Congressman David 
Bonior for the April 22 CBS This Morning. Mason challenged both politicians, 
and in so doing brought up points no other reporter mentioned. For instance, he 
asked Bonior: "After the last increase in the minimum wage, Department of Labor 
statistics show we lost some half a million jobs, I believe. Is this going to 
cost us jobs? Are we making a mistake if we do this now?"
<p>
He also asked Bonior, "Congressman, in the first two years of President 
Clinton's term, when you controlled Congress, this issue was never brought up. 
Why is it on the table suddenly now, when we're running up to an election? You 
had an opportunity to do something and it wasn't done then." Mason was the only 
reporter to look at what happened after past federal minimum-wage hikes and to 
point out that the Democrats didn't increase the minimum wage when they 
controlled Congress.
<p>
But for the most part, coverage of the minimum wage was overwhelmingly devoted 
to superficial political calculations, and even then, biased against those who 
opposed an increase in the minimum wage.

<title>Issue Analysis: Networks Don't Ask About Tuition Inflation</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<H2><center>Issue Analysis: Networks Don't Ask About Tuition Inflation</h2></center>
<p>
<center><h3>No Skepticism Toward College Costs</h3></center>
<p>
Imagine that there's a product or a service that has gone up in price by 239 percent over the past fifteen years and whose cost continues to increase well ahead of the rate of inflation. Imagine further that the company that produces the product or service blames consumers for the steep price increases. Would reporters accept such an excuse at face value? The CEO of the company would surely be seen sweating before the cameras of 60 Minutes or getting stern lectures from Nightline's Ted Koppel, right?
<p><b>
Not if the product is a college education.</B><br>
The same reporters who are quick to expect the worst -- and demand government action -- when businesses raise prices show a curious lack of curiosity about the shocking rise in college tuition rates over the past several years. In stories about tuition hikes, reporters almost never question the price increases. And they never, ever, bring up the explanation many conservatives and economists point to: government education subsidies help cause the price hikes.
<p>
The most recent example of this lack of skepticism came when President Clinton proposed a $1,500 tax credit for students in their first two years of college. On June 4, the day Clinton announced his proposal, no network report even hinted that it might cause tuition increases. CBS's Rita Braver, for example, merely said that it was "aimed at attracting all students into post-high school education." Peter Jennings called it "the latest giveaway in presidential politics." (That's what they always call tax cuts.) Jennings did point out in the next story that "college expenses are growing at twice the rate of inflation." But he didn't ask why or suggest that some argue Clinton's proposal would add to the problem.
<p>
This is part of a long pattern in network reporting on higher education. Media Research Center analysts reviewed all 23 stories about higher education financing on the ABC, CBS, CNN, and NBC news shows between June 1, 1995 and June 1, 1996. No reporter in any of the stories mentioned the argument that federal aid helps fuel the escalation in tuition costs.
<p>
To be sure, reporters often do point out that tuition costs are increasing dramatically. Many of the stories on higher education focus on families trying to deal with such costs. ABC's Tyler Mathison, on the July 12, 1995 <i>Good Morning America</i>, reported that with costs so high, "it's no wonder more and more American families are borrowing to pay the bills." Many stories are helpful to consumers by pointing out which colleges are the best buys.
<p>
But reporters rarely ask why college costs are rising. And when they do, they accept, without challenge, answers they would never accept from industry. Example: CBS's Susan Spencer, on the May 2, 1996 48 Hours. A college administrator told her that he would like to cut costs, but it might hurt the reputation of his school. "So most colleges aren't even trying to cut tuition," Spencer reported. "People might think the quality of education had been cut as well."
<p>
CBS had a different attitude toward the recent gasoline price increases. Dan Rather wondered: "Is it the free market at work, the law of supply and demand? Or, is it greed, or something more sinister?" The networks have also demanded explanations for price increases of other products, such as gasoline or breakfast cereals. But the ivory tower is above such questioning.
<p>
This omission leads to biased reporting of education policy proposals. CNN's Bobbie Battista, reporting on a speech by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton for the June 1, 1995 Inside Politics, said: "Mrs. Clinton also tweaked those who benefited from the U.S. education system and now want to cut it...She didn't name names, but presidential candidate Phil Gramm, who wants to abolish the Department of Education, went to college thanks to government-sponsored loans." And in hundreds of stories over the past year, Bill Clinton repeated his claim that cutting federal aid to students was "extreme" without being asked why taxpayers must continue to finance higher education's largesse.
<p>
Only one network reporter even suggested the tuition price increases may not be justified. Former CBS This Morning co-host Harry Smith, on March 12, pointed out that "the private sector, in terms of business out there, has done all this cutting over the last ten years or so to become more competitive." He asked consumer reporter Hattie Kauffman: "Are colleges doing that at all?" But even Smith didn't point out the argument that colleges and universities are shielded from such efficiency because of government subsidies.
<p>
Had he read an article by John Hood of the John Locke Foundation, in the May, 1995 issue of Reason, he might have. "Is land for classrooms that much more expensive? Is there a shortage of people becoming professors, bidding up the wages of those currently in colleges and universities? Do books cost more than they used to?" Hood asks. "The short answer is maybe -- but the cost increase in higher education far outpaces increases in any of those expenditures."
<p>
According to Hood, there are so many government subsidies at even private colleges and universities that "tuition and fees have only the murkiest relationship to the costs of providing higher education. The 'costs' themselves are essentially arbitrary." Hood explains that federal aid is given to a student based on how much costs exceed the student's "expected family contribution." Since colleges and universities know the average expected family contribution, they can increase tuitions and make more students eligible for aid. "Families will pay more, but a good portion of the tuition hike will be picked up by the government. Hence, colleges and universities can get more money for providing exactly the same service."
<p>
Proof? Hood looks at history. "During the 1970s, the real-dollar value of government assistance to higher education, adjusted for the number of full-time students, fell slightly. So did real tuition, room, and board charges for both public and private colleges," he claims. "Throughout the 1980s, however, government assistance per full-time student rose significantly (10 percent, not including loans), accompanied by a 27 percent real rise in public college charges and a staggering 50 percent real rise in private college charges." He points out that revenue from Pell grants rose by more than 25 percent between 1985 and 1992 and that state level grants rose by 15 percent. All the while, college administrators were complaining about "cutbacks" in federal aid and using that as an excuse to raise tuition.
<p>
But network reporters don't challenge college administrators about their continuous price increases. Apparently, when it comes to higher education, greed is good, or at least not worthy of criticism.

<h2><center>Editor's Note, by Timothy Lamer</center></h2>
<p>
<center><h3>Press: Fiscal Conservatives?</center></h3>
<p>
"There is a liberal bias [in the media]; it's demonstrable." 
"The old argument that the networks and other `media elites' have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore."
Are these quotes from Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey? Or maybe Rush Limbaugh and William Bennett? No, the above quotes are from two members of the "media elite" -- Newsweek Washington bureau chief Evan Thomas and CBS News correspondent Bernard Goldberg.
<p>
In the face of overwhelming evidence, some journalists are beginning to admit there's a liberal bias in the national media. But many of them ludicrously maintain that the bias only extends to social and cultural issues, not to economic issues, and that most reporters are in fact economic conservatives.
James Fallows of the Atlantic Monthly makes this claim in his recent book Breaking the News. He argues that "the supposed liberalism of the elite press is more limited than many people believe. On economic issues -- taxes, welfare, deficit control, trade policy, attitudes toward labor unions -- elite reporters' views have become far more conservative over the last generation, as their incomes have gone up."
<p>
The Washington Post's E.J. Dionne agrees. During a May 29 Brookings Institution panel discussion, he said that "the press mostly has the biases of the educated, some would say over-educated, upper middle class." This, Dionne argued, means there is a  liberal bias in coverage of social issues, but "the issues we're most conservative on are in fact economic issues, just like much of the upper middle class that looks at its tax bill."
<p>
Fallows and Dionne are highly- regarded beltway journalists, and properly so. But on this issue they are terribly mistaken. Their argument lacks one element: proof. Numerous studies conducted by the Media Research Center demonstrate that most economic reporting in the non-business media is solidly liberal. For example:
<p>
Tax cuts. Reporters used to be less biased in tax coverage than they have been recently. It was the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994 that ended any semblence of balance on tax issues. When tax cuts were being discussed in December of 1994, all 12 economists interviewed by the networks were against cutting taxes. The message: no matter what politicians say, tax cuts are bad economics. Then this year, when Steve Forbes' flat tax became a hot issue, reporters were more than twice as likely to mention arguments against it than for it. Fifty-one arguments against the flat tax were presented during January on the networks and in national news magazines. Only 24 arguments in favor were presented. Fallows and Dionne must know that "Reaganomics" has become a cuss word among reporters.
<p>
Federal regulations and mandates. Like most liberals, reporters seem to think businesses have money trees in their stockrooms. It rarely occurs to them that companies may have to increase prices, lay off workers, or reduce salaries and benefits in order to comply with regulations and mandates. A recent example is the debate over increasing the minimum wage. During the first four months of 1996, there were 60 sources interviewed for soundbites by the networks. Almost twice as many supported the increase (39) than opposed it (21).
<p>
Some reporters simply accepted the Democrats' logic at face value. According to NBC's Lisa Myers, the increase would be "good news for about 10 million workers" who earn near the minimum wage. CNN's Kathleen Kennedy worried that if the two parties couldn't agree, "people earning the minimum wage may not get a raise anytime soon."
<p>
Federal spending and the budget. Reporters seem to favor budget discipline when the issue is cutting taxes. But when spending programs are threatened, anecdotes abound outlining who will allegedly be harmed by fiscal restraint. During the first hundred days of this Congress, 34 network stories asserted that a balanced budget achieved by spending restraint would harm the poor. Only four stories focused on the benefits of a more limited government. And during the two government shutdowns last year, reporters repeatedly intoned about the "critical cuts" (Dan Rather) and "major cutbacks" (Tom Brokaw) in the GOP budget, without mentioning that Republicans planned to spend $267 billion more in 2002 than in 1996. According to CBS's Bob Mc-Namara, the shutdowns were "a hard lesson on what happens when big government goes away."
<p>
Part of the Fallows-Dionne misunderstanding may be in defining economic conservatism. For some reporters the definition is broad enough to include the architect of the Clinton health plan. CNN's Jeff Levine, on the August 30, 1993 Inside Politics, described (I'm not making this up) "the Ira Magaziner people" as "free marketeers."
<p>
If someone who proposed the biggest increase in government power since the New Deal is a "free marketeer," then who isn't? But if the definition includes, at the very least, some skepticism about government's ability to solve society's problems, few in the "media elite" qualify.

<title>After Hyping Worker Anxiety, National Press Ignores Contrary Evidence</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>After Hyping Worker Anxiety, National Press Ignores Contrary Evidence</center></h2>
<p>
<center><h3>Poll: Workers: Happy. Media: Yawn.</center></h3>
<p>
Few mantras have been repeated more often in the media this year than the one about anxious American workers. It's accepted as fact among reporters that American workers are alarmed about their prospects in the new, global economy.
Just ask Dan Rather. As MediaNomics reported earlier this year, he spotted "fear and anger" in the workforce over "layoffs and barely rising wages." According to CNN's Kathleen Kennedy, "The latest rounds of corporate cutbacks have left many people fearing that they may be the next to be fired." 
<p>
Tom Brokaw, introducing a January 29 Nightly News story about "today's frightening job market," announced: "Job security is a thing of the past now and the way of the future is downsizing and layoffs, even for America's biggest companies. It's making for serious anxiety." 
<p>
The print media have been similarlyfocused on gloom. The January 22 U.S. News & World Report cover asked: "Is the American Worker Getting Shafted?" (The magazine's answer: yes.) Newsweek's February 26 cover labeled four executives who had laid off employees as "Corporate Killers," and declared that the "public is scared as hell."
<p>
The New York Times saw fit to print a seven-part series depicting American workplaces as "battlefields" with "millions of casualties." According to the Times, the story of a man who lost a high-paying bank job, was forced to take a job at one-fourth the pay, and then had his family leave him "is no longer extraordinary."
<p><b>
Really?</b><br>
To find out, Inc. magazine tried something different. Rather than repeating emotional anecdotes about companies laying off loyal workers, Inc. commissioned the Gallup Organization to conduct a nationwide poll of workers.
<p>
"Across the board the 34 questions [to the worker survey] prompted upbeat -- sometimes even glowing -- responses," the magazine found. For example: 90 percent of the respondents were not worried about losing their jobs and 75 percent had not had three or more days in the past month when stress caused them to behave badly with their families. (For more survey results, see box.)
<p>
Interestingly, Inc. found that on many questions, workers at smaller companies are happier than those at large firms. The national media may be missing the story of worker happiness because they relentlessly focus on big business. Last summer, Media- Nomics found that in the first six months of 1995, there were 119 network evening news stories on the health of large companies, while only 13 stories focused on the health of those companies not in the Fortune 500.
This is truly a whopper of an omission, since smaller, fast-growing companies ("gazelles") created five million jobs between 1990 and 1994, while other companies lost 800,000.
<p>
The non-business media have not reported Inc.'s findings and have yet to tell the whole story about the true nature of the American workplace. It is a picture of the entire economy -- they aren't telling the whole story.

On May 2, the Clinton administration (and many reporters) busily played up the 
news that the economy had grown at a 2.8 percent rate. ABC's Brit Hume, while 
not downplaying the news, put it in political perspective.
<P>
Hume reported that Clinton economic advisor Laura D'Andrea Tyson called this 
"the second longest peacetime expansion since World War II, not mentioning that 
the longest was during the Reagan years, which the Clinton administration 
prefers to call the decade of greed." Hume pointed out that "she also did not 
mention that the expansion includes the last part of the Bush administration, a 
time Mr. Clinton always claimed was a recession."
<P>
Later that month, NBC's Mike Jensen reported another bit of good economic news. 
The giant companies that had been downsizing, Jensen said, have "finally 
started to rehire."
<P>
Unlike past reports on downsizing, Jensen interviewed a consultant who 
explained that the downsizing wave allowed companies to become more productive 
and profitable. The consultant, John Challenger, told viewers: "These companies 
are able to hire many people because of the downsizing decisions they made over 
the last few years."
<P>
Jensen even mentioned something rarely revealed in the news: "Ninety thousand 
new jobs were added to the nation's workforce every month on average for the 
last year, many of them at small companies." Jensen ended on a negative note, 
though. He said that many of these big companies are still downsizing their 
weaker divisions. "That's the new corporate America. Quick to fire, quick to 
hire, with American workers scrambling to find a job and to keep one." (See 
front page for why that's not the typical plight of workers.)

<title>The Algers: Back to the Future</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>The Algers: Back to the Future</h2></center>
<p>
<center><h3>CBS show highlights successful owners of growing businesses</h3></center>
<p>
On the evening of June 16, CBS aired a program whose message was mainstream American: that talent, initiative, perseverance, and, usually, religious faith are the formula for business success. For an hour viewers saw an unusual sight: Hollywood celebrities unabashedly touting the virtues of free market successes.
A rerun from the 1950s? Hardly. It was the 48th annual Horatio Alger Awards. From the opening segment, Ray Charles's rendition of "America the Beautiful," Bob Dole and William Bennett couldn't have scripted a more tradition-friendly, role model-dominated hour.
<p>
As always, Algers were presented to persons who, like the award's namesake, have emerged from humble circumstances to make a name for themselves. Each story is magnificent non-fiction that shatters the myth that America is no longer the land of opportunity. 
<p>
This path, as viewers saw, knows neither gender nor color: among this year's honorees were a woman -- Ruth Fertel, founder of the Ruth's Chris Steak House chain -- and two blacks: music entrepreneur Quincy Jones and Joe Dudley, who grew up in a three-room shack as one of eleven children and now runs the Dudley Products cosmetics company.
<p>
In videotaped biographical packages preceding their acceptance of the award, the winners discussed their success and their philosophies of life. By dint of hard work, Herbert Boeckmann wound up running the largest Ford dealership in America. This highly motivated achiever spoke movingly of how his father's charitable deeds had spurred his own efforts toward "help[ing] people help themselves."
<p> 
Qunicy Jones reflected: "I don't think God put us here to have everything go right every minute. That's why He's got those other funny words like 'discipline' and 'adversity.' That's what helps shape your character, and it sounds corny, but it's not corny, it's real."  
<p>
John Pappajohn, the president of Equity Dynamics, reminisced about growing up: "We didn't have much money, but we seemed to get along just fine." And he remarked, "I was recently asked by a young man who suffered adversity, 'What do I have to do in order to be successful?' I said, 'Have a dream, and be willing to pay the price in order to have your dream come true.'" 
<p>
Dennis Washington, who now presides over a business empire which includes construction, railroad, mining, and shipping companies, remembered, "We didn't have a lot of money...but the family was together. That means so much."
Looking back, Washington says, "The early part of your life, you may get [dealt] a bad hand, but, remember, that's a [short] period...and if you can focus on the future by finding something that you like to do, with luck and help from God, you're gonna have a good life." 
<p>
As traditional values-oriented as the Algers were, there was nothing politically partisan about them. (Even a brief appearance by Maya Angelou was non-PC.) The show was co-hosted by actress Markie Post and actor John Ritter, both of whom have been outspokenly pro-Clinton; nonetheless, they effectively articulated what the Algers represent. 
<p>
When Ritter, introducing one honoree -- Miami Dolphins coach Don Shula -- declared, "Values, beliefs, principles. You know, some call those old-fashioned, but to others, they're the surest sign of leadership," it was hard to imagine Charlton Heston doing it any better.
<p>
The Algers were produced for television by actor Don Johnson. Two years ago, on the occasion of the ceremony's first national telecast, Johnson told the Media Research Center that the awards are "based on good, old-fashioned, fundamental tools for success...Let's encourage success. That's what America's about." Again, like Post and Ritter, Johnson is not known as a conservative Republican. <p> 
The Algers will never be standard prime time fare, yet it's hard not to think that there's room for other programs like it. And perhaps some of prime time television's scriptwriters, who so often like to paint businessmen as society's villains, were watching and picking up ideas for inspirational business storylines.

<title>Minimum Scrutiny at the New York Times</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Minimum Scrutiny at the New York Times</h2></center>
<p>
In 1994 Princeton economists David Card and Alan Krueger released the "New Jersey Study," a research paper which claimed that a hike in the minimum wage would increase employment. The Card-Krueger study received considerable press attention, and very little scrutiny, even though it provided the intellectual argument for the Clinton administration's proposal to increase the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 an hour in February of this year.   
<p>
The New York Times, for example, touted the study and its call for a hike in the minimum wage in several stories. The Times' Louis Uchitelle wrote in the January 12 Business section: "Two Princeton University economists, David Card and Alan Krueger, contend there is little evidence of any job loss at all from increasing the minimum wage." 
<p>
Since the initial reports of the Card-Krueger study, however, the Employment Policies Institute (EPI) has found that the study is based on flawed data. In a March 29 Wall Street Journal column, EPI Executive Director Richard Berman contends that "the Card-Krueger data are worse than flawed -- they are grossly inaccurate." Berman continues: "How do I know? My organization took the time to check the actual payroll records [studied by Card and Krueger]...The payroll records do not match the Card-Krueger data. Only a handful come anywhere close."
<p>
Several newspapers across the country, including the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times, have published EPI's findings. But despite several attempts by EPI to point out the flaws of the Card-Krueger study to the Times, America's newspaper of record has not yet acknowledged the Institute's findings.
<p>
John Doyle of EPI tells MediaNomics that "it was a real surprise when -- after the study was proven to be based on flawed data, and as a result, worthless -- the New York Times ignored our repeated efforts to publicize the study's flaws. This was not a critique of just another economic study. We pulled the underpinning from the administration's efforts to hike the minimum wage."
Perhaps the Times is just waiting for the right news peg.

<title>Reporters Still Ignoring the Real Tax Record of the 1980s</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Tax and Pretend about Budget Deficit</h2>
</center>
<p>
Here we go again. With Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole pondering a large tax cut proposal, many in the media are telling their viewers and readers that cutting taxes is inimical to balancing the budget.
<p>
"When you talk about a balanced budget and then you talk about big tax cuts, that's smoke and mirrors," argued NBC's Tim Russert, questioning House Speaker Newt Gingrich on the June 2 Meet the Press. "Bob Dole has been searching for a campaign issue that will mark clear-cut differences between himself and Mr. Clinton," stated ABC's Peter Jennings on the June 3 World News Tonight. But with taxes, "has Mr. Dole painted himself into a corner?" A week later, on the June 10 show, Jennings asked Dole in an interview: "Cutting taxes or the budget deficit, how can you do both?"
<p>
That doing both is impossible has been an article of faith for reporters for years. 
<p>
Since the 1980s, especially the late 1980s, reporters have repeatedly blamed budget deficits on tax cuts. In 1989 and 1990 they scolded George Bush for promising not to raise taxes and urged him to change his mind. On July 18, 1989, CBS Evening News reporter Mark Phillips, for instance, referred to "the stubborn budget deficit that most economists say will never be seriously reduced without the new taxes to which the President [Bush] remains opposed." 
<p>
"We cannot simply sidestep what is happening by resorting to old ideologies and new slogans," stated Mortimer Zuckerman in the February 6, 1989 U.S. News & World Report. Asked Zuckerman: "Who wants to read Bush's lips when to do so in the face of gigantic budget deficits means the slow decline of the America we know and believe in?" And correspondent Richard Threlkeld, on the October 16, 1990 CBS Evening News, opined: "So if and when they do sort out that deficit mess it's likely the rich are going to get soaked, at least a little, to make up for the soaking they avoided in the `80s."
<p>
But are tax cuts really such bad policy? Bruce Bartlett, a senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, points out in the May 27 Washington Times that when tax cut detractors are "asked for evidence that the American people suffered from [President] Reagan's tax cut, they have none to offer except the budget deficit."
<p>
This is a spurious argument, Bartlett maintains. "In fact, the tax cut had nothing whatsoever to do with the increase in federal budget deficits in the 1980s. On average, federal receipts as a share of GDP were higher in the 1980s than in the 1970s -- 19.0 percent of GDP versus 18.5 percent." According to Bart-lett, the deficit increase was caused by massive spending increases, with outlays increasing from 20.6 percent of GDP in the 1970s to 23.1 percent in the 1980s.
<p>
Bartlett demonstrates that real economic growth averaged 3.9 percent per year between 1982 and 1989, more than double the average for the 1990s. He also points out that "real median family income increased by $4,564 between 1982 and 1989, an increase of 12.6 percent, while it has fallen by $2,108, a decline of 5.2 percent in the low deficit 1990s."
<p>
If, as is most likely to be the case, tax cuts become part of the debate in this year's campaign, reporters should at least be skeptical of those who claim that they inevitably lead to higher deficits and other dreary economic outcomes.

<title>Issue Analysis: Are Some Risky Products More Newsworthy Than Others?</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Addicted to Tobacco Stories</h2>
</center>
<p>
The following is adapted from a Media Research Center special report, to be released later this summer, about news media coverage of risky products and the companies which make and sell them:
<p>
It is estimated that about 400,000 Americans die each year from smoking-related illnesses.
<p>
It is also estimated that about 300,000 Americans die each year from obesity-related illnesses. And studies show that fully one-third of Americans (75 million) are overweight.
<p>
Given these statistics, it's reasonable to assume that there are three news stories about dietary fat and the industries that sell products with dietary fat for every four news stories about tobacco and the tobacco industry, right?
<p>
Wrong. Media Research Center analysts counted every evening news story during the first six months of 1996 that had to do with tobacco and every evening news story during the same period that had to do with obesity and dietary fat. (Shows analyzed were ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, CNN's The World Today, and NBC Nightly News.) There were 138 stories about tobacco and the tobacco industry, all of which portrayed tobacco as a risky product. There were only 38 stories about dietary fat and obesity which portrayed fat as risky to consumers, a difference of almost four to one.
<p>
It's hard to escape the conclusion that tobacco has been singled out. Unlike fat, no angle of tobacco or of the tobacco industry went uncovered during the study period. There were reports, for example, about increases in teen smoking. NBC's Brian Williams, introducing a January 25 Nightly News story, told of  "a disturbing report out today on teenage smoking from the Centers for Disease Control. Despite all the pressures to stop, all the attempts to restrict cigarette sales, kids in much of this country are picking up the habit faster than ever." According to NBC's Bob Kur, in the same story, "Teenagers are part of 47 million smokers nationwide whose habit costs the country $50 billion in medical care." Bill Clinton's anti-tobacco photo-ops were also popular news stories. ABC's Peter Jennings, on the May 7 World News Tonight, reported that "President Clinton was in a New Jersey classroom warning that 3,000 teenagers start to smoke every day."
<p>
Another big tobacco story: The political donations of the industry and how those donations allegedly affected politicians' attitudes and actions toward tobacco. This was especially the case when Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole claimed that, for some people, smoking isn't addictive. Reason magazine senior editor Jacob Sullum, writing in the July 29 National Review, asserted that in such reports, the assumption usually is "that tobacco companies had given Dole and the Republican Party a lot of money, so he was clearly in league with the devil." According to Sullum, such reports assume the industry buys votes and never consider "the possibility that politicians...might get tobacco money because they support certain policies, rather than the other way around."
<p>
Sullum is right. Linda Douglass, for example, on the June 27 CBS Evening News told viewers that "Dole now is in the uncomfortable position of often siding with the tobacco industry just as cigarette makers are pumping unprecedented sums of money into the Republican Party." On that same night, NBC's Kur, after quoting the Clinton campaign's charge that Dole was toeing the tobacco industry line, pointed out, with a large on-screen graphic, that the industry "gave nearly $3 million in political contributions last year, 85 percent of the money to Republicans." 
<p>
There were also a great many stories about former tobacco industry executives and scientists admitting that they had known all along that nicotine is addictive, and numerous lawsuits against the tobacco industry were deemed of enough national importance to make the evening news.
<p>
In contrast, there were far fewer stories about fat and obesity and the industries which help produce them. Should tobacco really warrant so many more stories than fat? How dangerous is obesity? According to reporters themselves, it is quite dangerous. NBC's Tom Brokaw said, on the April 29 Nightly News, that "obesity, of course, is a major health problem in this country. It is estimated that it's responsible for 300,000 deaths a year from heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and the like." CBS's Jacqueline Adams, on the April 9 CBS Evening News, reported that "for years doctors have known that during pregnancy, obesity can cause serious problems like diabetes and bleeding for the mother. But according to two new studies in tomorrow's Journal of the American Medical Association, obesity in the mother can also cause serious problems for the fetus," including birth defects.
<p>
Even one high-fat meal can be dangerous, according to ABC's John McKenzie. On the May 9 World News Tonight, McKenzie told viewers about a study conducted at the University of Maryland in which researchers "found that after a high-fat meal, arteries, when required to handle an increased flow of blood, could expand on average only 50 percent of normal. It means that under conditions of stress and exertion, people who already have constricted arteries may not get enough blood to the heart."
<p>
So why so much more attention to the tobacco industry than to industries that produce fat? There were never any heated stories on the evening news about fast-food advertising enticing kids and others to consume products that may one day kill them. There were no reporters monitoring the political donations of fast-food restaurant chains and their trade associations. There were no stories in which reporters asked food-industry executives if they believed their products to be harmful. And there were no stories pointing out the medical-care costs of obesity.
<p>
Either the network evening news shows spend too much time covering tobacco or not enough covering the dangers of obesity and dietary fat. Either way, one politically incorrect product and industry is being singled out for intensive news coverage while other risky products and the industries which produce them are not.

<center><h2>Kudos: Krulwich and Corporate Layoff Fears</h2>
</center>
<p>
All this year MediaNomics has reported on how the TV networks have overhyped the economic insecurity of American workers. A March study, for instance, showed that there had been 19 stories in the first two months of the year about layoffs, but only two about job growth. The June issue reported on how the media were ignoring an Inc. magazine\Gallup poll showing that most workers are quite secure and happy.
<p>
Finally, some reporters are starting to question the layoff legend. "The fears," said Forest Sawyer, in his introduction to a July 3 World News Tonight story, "are not always supported by the facts." 
<p>
Robert Krulwich, an economics correspondent for ABC News, continued: "Because we read every day about corporate layoffs and corporate downsizing and job anxiety, most of us now believe the world has changed...[but] what we all think is happening is not." According to Krulwich, "We Americans stay at our jobs about as long as we did 20 years ago. If you go back to 1973 to see how many folks had been at the same company for 10 years or more, for the younger group it was 28.8 percent and for the older group it was 45.1 percent. Now let's go forward to 1993, and look at this, the percentages are up, but very slightly. No big change at all."
<p>
He quoted Henry Farber, an economist at Princeton University: "And so what this is telling me is that there is basically just about as much job stability now as there was 20 years ago."
<p>
But then Krulwich tried to explain why people seem to feel more insecure now than they did in past decades. "Here's one possible explanation," Krulwich ventured. "Yeah, lots of people left jobs in 1973; lots of people left jobs in 1993. The numbers look the same...[but] there is some evidence that back in the 1970s more people happily quit their jobs for better pay, whereas today more people get fired." According to Krulwich, "Today people may stay at their jobs because they are afraid of losing their health insurance or their benefits, so they are stuck. Back then people maybe stayed on their jobs because they liked them."
<p>
This explanation conflicts, however, with the Inc. poll, which showed that 70 percent think management makes their workplaces great places to work, that 84 percent had opportunities to grow and learn at work, and that almost 70 percent thought they were paid fairly. This is not the picture of an unhappy work force.
<p>
While his diagnosis of worker attitudes may have been suspect, kudos to Krulwich for reporting the facts about job tenure.

<title>Labor Money Is OK</title>

<center><h2>Labor Money Is OK</h2></center>
<p>
Jackie Judd's report on the June 14 ABC World News Tonight warned of the close-knit nature of the relationships between, as anchor Peter Jennings put it, "politicians and the industries they are supposed to oversee." So far, so good. But their look at the ties of big business overlooked another group: Big Labor. 
<p>
Jennings introduced Judd's report: "Many politicians still like to wine and dine and travel on somebody else's tab." Judd focused on Democratic Senator Ernest Hollings, Republican Senator Larry Pressler, and House Republican Pat Roberts, who all accepted free travel from industries for which they chair committees. Of Hollings, Judd said: "As Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he took half a dozen trips courtesy of industries his committee oversees." And of Roberts, Judd said: "The American Crop Association hosted him at the swanky Greenbrier resort in West Virginia, and the Dairy Foods Association flew Roberts to Miami for a four day trip."
<p>
Judd's findings were worthy of reporting, but she didn't go far enough. As with most stories about the influence of money in politics, Judd's only looked at business. Labor groups also finance junkets for those in Congress and spend lavishly on campaigns, but viewers were left in the dark about their activities. 
<p>
Judd also didn't ponder why industry finds it necessary to lobby in the first place: often to defend their turf from encroaching government power. What Judd sees as industry's cozy cronyism may be simply a method of survival in a regulatory age.

<center><h2>Just Whom Does Big Business Support?</h2></center>
<p>
Reporters ignore actual donations, label conservatives as industry-backed
A burden of being a free market think tank or activist group in Washington must be knowing that TV network news typically ignores your work. What may be almost as bad is when network reporters cite the work of your free market group, but then sully its credibility by labeling the group "industry-supported."
<p>
It doesn't seem to matter to TV reporters that groups supporting expanded government policies actually receive more funding from corporations than do many of the free market think tanks. Nor does it seem to occur to reporters that some corporations may like, and profit from, big government policies more than from a free market.
<p>
Take CBS' Eric Engberg. On the June 21 CBS Evening News, Engberg reported on the efforts of conservatives in Congress to "defund the left," or stop the federal government from subsidizing the lobbying efforts of liberal advocacy groups. According to Engberg: "Right-leaning advocacy groups would be largely untouched by the legislation because they receive little federal aid and often have deep-pocketed backers in the business world."
<p>
Engberg failed to point out that many of the liberal groups which receive government money in fact have business backers with deeper pockets than those of most conservative groups. According to Stuart Nolan of the Capital Research Center, "Popular opinion incorrectly ties conservatives to big business, while liberals claim the moral high ground by championing 'the little guy.' In truth, however, big business tends to support conservative nonprofits only on legal issues and, to a lesser degree, on regulatory ones. Corporate America tends to fund liberals who specialize in women's, family, minority, and environmental issues."
<p>
According to Nolan's research, Corporate America donates over three times more to left-of-center groups than to right-of-center groups. Examples: AT&T financially supports such liberal groups as the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the NAACP, the National Council of La Raza, and the National Organization for Women (NOW).
<p>
And Times Mirror supports the Children's Defense Fund, the NAACP, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the National Urban League, and Planned Parenthood. Yet none of these industry supported groups are labeled as such by reporters. 
Conservative groups aren't so lucky. The latest example is the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), a free market environmental group. While CEI does receive some of its funding from corporations, so do liberal environmental organizations, such as the Environmental Defense Fund and the National Audubon Society. That didn't stop two CBS reporters from placing only CEI in the same boat as "industry."
<p>
On the May 30 CBS Evening News, reporter Rita Braver (and Bill Plante on the May 31 This Morning), after reviewing President Clinton's objections to revisions of the Clean Water Act, referred to "industry groups and their supporters" before running a soundbite from CEI's Fred Smith. While Braver and Plante should be commended for interviewing Smith, liberal environmentalists who get more money from industry than CEI have escaped such labeling.
<p>
Industry is not a monolith. Some businesses support and prosper from free markets. Others do not and give money to groups which favor government activity in the marketplace. By missing this point, reporters unfairly tilt credibility against the think tanks and advocacy groups which support free markets in favor of those which do not.

<title>Lisa Myers: Ahead of the Pack</title>

<blockquote>
<center><h2>Lisa Myers: Ahead of the Pack</h2></center>
<p>
NBC correspondent uncovers angles other Washington reporters miss
For some time now, NBC's Lisa Myers has been one of the most perceptive network news reporters based in Washington. Her beat is politics, but she brings to that calling an economics perspective which even some of the most seasoned business reporters lack.
<p>
Since the beginning of the year, Myers has spent most of her time covering the new Republican majority on Capitol Hill. She has been no knee-jerk partisan of the GOP. Often she challenges Hill leaders for practicing the same kind of old-fashioned politics they had claimed to repudiate in the November elections.
On the March 14 Nightly News, for instance, Myers took House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston to task for directing pork spending into his and other committee members' districts. "Bob Livingston preaches budget cutting with the fervor of a televangelist," Myers reported. "When critics charged that cuts victimized the poor, Livingston argued that the real victims today are taxpayers." 
<p>
But, she said, "he and his committee seem less concerned about reaching into taxpayers' pockets when it comes to their own pork barrel projects." After pointing out the nearly $3 billion Appropriations Committee members had steered to their own districts, Myers said the policy, though started by Democrats, "runs contrary to promises that this Republican Congress would be different."
On the May 23 Nightly News her target was Senatorial junkets. She described one junket in which five senators flew to Bali to visit a bamboo training center. She criticized both Republicans and Democrats, namely Senators Bennett Johnston, Alan Simpson, and self-proclaimed fiscal conservative Arlen Specter. She also detailed the extensive travels of one Congressman, supposedly to learn more about foreign policy issues, even though he sits on the Agriculture and Small Business Committees.
<p>
In contrast to many other political reporters in Washington, Myers also turns a skeptical eye toward many popular government programs. President Bill Clinton's pet program, Americorps, has received extremely favorable coverage from other networks. But Myers, on the February 16 Nightly News, looked at the facts. "Everyone agrees that what these young people are doing is worthwhile," Myers said. "The issue is whether it's a smart use of taxpayers' money. Critics insist it's not, that it's the last gasp of big government liberalism."
<p>
She pointed out that "an environmental project in Alaska costs taxpayers $42,000 per volunteer per year" and also that a grant of "$140,000 [went] to Northeastern University, [but] not a penny went for volunteers." She challenged a bureaucrat who helps run the program, finding that "even a top supervisor described Americorps as a jobs program," which "is not the way the Clinton Administration sold it to Congress."
<p>
On the May 25 Nightly News, Myers examined the federal government's program to subsidize America's sugar growers. According to her, "The sugar secret is hidden in many of your favorite foods: candy, cereal, even canned hams. The sugar growers like it that way. They get billions of dollars; you pay inflated prices and don't even know it, which is one reason the sugar program is one of the sweetest deals around."
<p>
Myers explained that "government price supports and import restrictions combine to drive up the cost of sugar in this country. This year the world price of sugar is 14 cents a pound. But U.S. growers get 22 cents a pound." She pointed out that the total cost to consumers is $1.4 billion a year and that most of the benefits go to large corporate sugar farmers rather than small family farmers.
<p>
On the June 13 Nighty News, Myers proved unafraid to investigate one of the most powerful lobbying forces for big government in America -- the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP). "If you think the AARP is some frail group of old people," she reported, "think again. In reality the AARP is one of the most influential voices in [Washington], trusted by 33 million members who are powerful because they vote as a bloc." She pointed out that most AARP money comes not from dues but from selling and endorsing products.
<p>
"However, an NBC News analysis found that while these products and endorsements are good business for the AARP," Myers said, "they are not always good deals for its members." She interviewed experts in such fields as investment banking and health insurance who told viewers that the AARP-sponsored products are usually not the best on the market and are overpriced because of the fee the AARP receives for products sold.
<p>
But it's Myers health care reporting which especially distinguishes her from many of her colleagues. While her beat is politics, and she therefore focuses on political angles, Myers nevertheless consistently brings up important economic facts which other reporters -- even economics reporters -- miss. In the previous Congressional term, for instance, when the Clinton Administration was proposing a sweeping health care program and assuring Americans that it knew how much the program would grow over the years, Myers looked at history and was skeptical.
<p>
On the September 29, 1993 Nightly News, Myers said: "When LBJ proposed [Medicare] he claimed it would cost $8 billion in 1990. The actual cost was $98 billion. Many health experts and economists are already challenging key assumptions of the Clinton plan."
<p>
The only other network reporter to point out the poor track record of government health care estimates, and how the government always underestimates rather than overestimates costs, was CBS's Ray Brady.
<p>
When, last year, the Democrats' favorite health care soundbite was that each American should get the same extravagant medical coverage as members of Congress, Myers kept her eye on the ball. On the June 21, 1994 Nightly News, she asked about such rhetoric: "And who will pay? One way or another, you will." 
<p>
And on this year's hottest health care issue, Medicare reform, Myers has again provided unique insights. The root problem of Medicare, according to Myers, is that "elderly Americans are getting far more in benefits than they ever paid in taxes. Fact: The average man retiring today will have paid about $24,000 in Medicare taxes and will get $85,000 in benefits. For women, who live longer, the difference is even greater: $25,000 in taxes compared with $104,000 in benefits." She is, so far, the only network reporter to point out the large disparities.
<p>
Myers, however, is no ideologue. In 1992 she gave less than charitable coverage to both Republican Presidential candidates, George Bush ("Even judged by the words of his own inaugural address, he comes up short.") and Pat Buchanan ("Pat Buchanan leads with anger."). She also has been critical of Republican plans to cut taxes and reform welfare. 
<p>
She is, above all, fair. She regularly does what good Washington reporters should, but don't usually, do: take skeptical looks at not just "waste," but at the programs government claims to run well, and remember that there are usually economic facts underneath every political story.

<title>Repeating NIH Press Releases</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<h2><center>Repeating NIH Press Releases</center></h2>
<p>
A widely circulated Washington Fax, published and edited by Bradie Metheny, confirms what many suspected: reporters often frame government spending stories along the lines of the press releases of the agencies affected. The fax noted that representatives of and those associated with the National Institutes of Health admit openly they manipulated media coverage to save funding for their agency. 
<p>
"Between May 7 and May 25," the fax reported, "biomedical research was featured in seven network news shows. ABC's Prime Time Live did a story on why funding for seemingly esoteric basic research is key to future advances in medicine. And on PBS, talk show host Charlie Rose interviewed researcher Paul Marks about the implications of the proposed cuts at NIH."
<p>
This same type of "if government doesn't do it who will" mentality was also prevalent in print media. According to the fax: "The New York Times editorial and Op-Ed pages both featured commentaries supporting a strong federal investment in biomedical research and science in general and condemning Republican budget proposals in this area. The Times also had a front-page story May 22 that said basic research was at risk in the battle over balancing the budget."
<p>
How did NIH manage such favorable coverage? "Much of the media activity was due to the efforts of the scientific community to focus attention on the budget cuts threatening NIH," reported the authors of the fax. "The New York Times coverage, for example, was in no small measure due to a lengthy phone call made from Washington state to the Times' board of editors by Jordan Cohen, president of the Association of American Medical Colleges."
<p>
The moral of the story: Public relations departments drive the news. Those wanting to cut government spending need to start working the phones.

<title>Issue Analysis: Networks Report on Victims of Products, Not Litigation</title>

<center><h2>Issue Analysis: Networks Report on Victims of Products, Not Litigation</center></h2>
<p>
Reporters Rail Against Legal Reform
<p>
Most observers of the media will agree that if there is one group to which almost all reporters are partial, it's victims. Reporters are eager to cover those who have been injured wrongfully or who have suffered injustices. Such profiles are commonplace in stories about nearly every political issue and often send powerful signals to viewers and readers about which side of an issue deserves sympathy.
<p>
Often this biases stories against free market policies. It is easy, after all, to interview those who get government benefits and who will, at least in the short term, suffer if the benefits are reduced. It's not as easy to interview a young person whose future is being mortgaged to pay for the government programs.
<p>
Current Congressional efforts to reform the U.S. legal system, therefore, present the media with an exceptional opportunity to be balanced. There are clear, identifiable victims on both sides of the tort reform issue. On the anti-reform side are those who have been harmed by a defective product and for whom the courts may be the only redress.
<p>
On the pro-reform side are the small business owners who have been forced to lay off workers or even go out of business because of frivolous lawsuits; as well as small business owners who have caved in to settlement demands in frivolous cases because they could not afford to defend themselves in court.
Despite this clear opportunity, reporters dropped the ball. Media- Nomics analysts reviewed every story about legal reform on each TV network's evening newscast during the first five months of this Congress. While reporters more than adequately covered the plights of those who have had to sue companies because of defective products, they did not interview or focus on a single small business owner or other victims of frivolous lawsuits. Reporters were also completely uninterested in exploring the economic costs of the current legal system.
<p>
Of the 19 legal reform stories that aired, eleven focused on neutral facts about recent Congressional action on legal reform, eight were explicitly critical of such reforms, and no story was critical of the status quo. Six of the eight stories critical of reform described how the status quo helps victims of defective products or medical malpractice. None probed how the status quo may hurt those who are targets of frivolous lawsuits.
<p>
The soundbites were similarly skewed. No business owner, small or large, was interviewed for a soundbite; only two representatives of business associations were interviewed. Five lawyers, by contrast, were interviewed for soundbites, as were four representatives of trial lawyers associations and five representatives of self-described consumer groups. Six stories carried soundbites from victims of defective products; none carried soundbites from victims of frivolous lawsuits. No story featured an interview with an economist, who could have told viewers of the economic benefits of legal reform.
<p>
Bob Faw's May 2 NBC Nightly News story was typical. "62-year-old sheet metal worker Ben Jones was a victim, not just of cancer, but of medical malpractice," Faw reported. "Four years ago doctors at this Fort Worth hospital bungled. Instead of removing Jones' cancerous left lung, they removed his healthy right lung." According to Faw, "The doctors also lied about what they had done and by the time Jones found out, it was too late. He died painfully and unnecessarily."
<p>
Faw interviewed the victim's widow, son, and attorney, plus a member of the American Medical Association (AMA). While the AMA member did point out that much of the money from malpractice awards goes to lawyers, Faw nonetheless concluded by wondering if "efforts to reign in lawyers will end up hurting the Jones'."
<p>
Similarly, on the March 10 CBS Evening News, Art Rascon profiled the case of a Florida boy who because of doctors' mistakes has been in a vegetative state for the past ten years. Because of a Florida law stating that damage awards over $200,000 must be approved by the state legislature, Rascon explained, the boy's family hasn't received any money. "So little Justin still lies in bed," Rascon concluded, "the victim of not only a tragic medical mistake, but of a legal and political system that has yet to resolve the fate of this 11-year-old boy."
<p>
One reporter, ABC's Tim O'Brien, seemed especially hostile to reform. On the March 7 World News Tonight, O'Brien downplayed worries of a litigation explosion and said that "making the loser pay the winner's legal expenses may reduce the number of lawsuits, but most consumer groups insist only the wealthy could sue." O'Brien only interviewed representatives of the Association of Trial Lawyers and of Consumer Action.
<p>
Two days later, on the March 9 World News Tonight, O'Brien again interviewed a narrow range of sources, this time only a representative of Public Citizen, a consumer group backed by trial lawyers. O'Brien and his source, Public Citizen's Joan Claybrook, tried to play down the abuse of punitive damages in product liability lawsuits.
<p>
According to O'Brien most of the large awards which make headlines are later reduced on appeal. "Consumer groups insist the mere threat of punitive damage awards benefits the public," O'Brien said. He never gave the other side: The mere threat of punitive damages also causes many wrongfully accused firms to settle cases because it's cheaper than litigating, even if they win.
<p>
On the March 13 World News Tonight, O'Brien focused on what effect legal reform would have on malpractice lawsuits. His story focused on Willie King, a patient who had the wrong foot amputed by doctors. Viewers heard from King, his attorney, and the president of the Trial Lawyers of America. Said O'Brien: "[King's] lawyer says Congress should be making doctors more accountable for mistakes, not less."
<p>
Missing from O'Brien's story was, for instance, an economist who could have told viewers that large malpractice awards cause everyone's insurance rates to go up. Reporters in general ignored economists who could have informed viewers of the economic benefits which most experts think legal reform would usher in.
No one on either side of the debate would argue that those injured by faulty products shouldn't have the right to seek redress in court; and Faw, Rascon, and O'Brien were not wrong to focus attention on such victims. 
<p>
But legal reform is a complex issue. As with most other political issues, the economic ramifications of legal reform have not been explored by reporters. And anecdotes about victims of defective products and services were not balanced by reports on another set of victims whose stories need to be told: the wrongfully accused small business owners who are often hurt by the current system. Viewers need to know that there are victims on both sides of the legal reform issue if they are to be well-informed.

<Title>Service Jobs Stereotyped by Brady</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Service Jobs Stereotyped by Brady</h2>
</center>
<p>
Ray Brady, CBS's economics correspondent, would be a great economics analyst -- if this were the 19th century. For Brady the only good job is manufacturing job. His rhetoric would have you think that service jobs are something akin to slavery, with most of the jobs created since the 1980s being for hamburger flippers. This vastly underestimates the power of the late- 20th century American economy to create good service jobs.
<p>
On the July 7 CBS Evening News, Brady reported on a drop in the unemployment rate that "on the surface, it looks like good news, but if you dig into the numbers, they're really not that great." Why? Because "we're losing manufacturing jobs, which are high paying, and we're adding amusement park kinds of jobs, which don't pay much."
<p>
This is nothing new for Brady, who has been bashing service jobs for years. On March 10, 1989, he reported that "in today's figures, the big job increase is in low-paying service industry jobs" while a graphic of a teen flipping burgers was on the screen. Good employment news on September 4, 1992 was tempered by losses in "manufacturing, the industry that's the heartbeat of the economy."
<p>
On March 5, 1993, Brady reported that "there was hardly any growth in high paying manufacturing jobs," only in service jobs, which "don't pay what the old jobs did." And on March 4, 1994, Brady reported that despite a drop in unemployment, "still, the biggest winners came in low-paying service jobs."
<p>
But just how bad are service jobs. According to National Review's Ed Rubenstein, service jobs include "positions in law, advertising, computers, and medicine." During the 1980s, he reported, "only 12 percent of the increase in employment occurred in the lowest-paid, low-skilled service occupations such as retailing and fast-food restaurants." And what about the 1990s? According to NBC's Tom Brokaw, on the January 30 Nightly News, "The Census Bureau today said that [computer] software is by far the fastest growing part of the service economy."
<p>
So Brady and other reporters should take a good look at the wide range of service jobs before stereotyping them as "amusement park kinds of jobs." Most of the new service workers do just fine.

<center><h2>Reporters Promote Corporate Welfare </h2>
</center>
<p>
Journalists don't question Administration officials' defense of business pork 
The corporate welfare state has found presumably unwitting allies in the media. Despite the Clinton Administration's stated policy of being against federal subsidies for business, reporters haven't challenged Administration officials to explain their defense of business pork against budget cutters.
<p>
CNN's Charles Bierbauer, for example, on the July 4 World News reported on the threatened elimination of the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration (USTTA). Introducing the story, anchor Bobbie Battista described USTTA as "the small federal agency set up to lure tourists to the U.S....now on the chopping block." 
<p>
Bierbauer quoted Greg Farmer, Undersecretary of the Commerce Department, defending the program: "There's a new job created every 2.5 seconds in the travel and tourism industry in the world. I want the United States to get its fair share." He didn't ask Farmer if this made USTTA an example of corporate welfare. Bierbauer concluded his segment by saying that "tourists will continue to come to the United States, of course, but they may no longer have Uncle Sam to lead them here."
<p>
Another network reporter who let corporate welfare go unchallenged was John Roberts, who warned, on the June 25 CBS Evening News, of federal summer job programs being hurt by Republican budget cuts. "For the past 30 years," Roberts said, "kids from low income families have had help from the federal summer jobs program, which funds student employment."  Concluding his story, Roberts said: "[Labor Secretary Robert] Reich points out that one-third of disadvantaged kids who get summer jobs in the private sector wind up working for the same companies in permanent jobs."
<p>
But, if that's the case, isn't a federal program that forces taxpayers to subsidize the training costs of businesses a prime example of corporate welfare, which Reich claims to oppose? Roberts didn't ask the Labor Secretary. 
<p>
A July 2 Washington Post story lacked similar insights. "Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, a strong advocate of free trade, today expressed confidence 'cooler heads will ultimately prevail' and his department will not be dismantled by Republicans in Congress," according to the Post.
<p>
"As Commerce Secretary, Brown has made U.S. exports a cornerstone of his department, leading trips abroad with American businessmen in hopes of prying open overseas markets." The Post quoted Brown: "It's unbelievable that the United States would be the only country in the world where the private sector would not have a seat at the Cabinet table."
<p>
The Post didn't speculate that the Commerce Department may itself embody corporate welfare. Nor did the Post give any non-Administration views, such as those of economist Murray Weidenbaum of the Center for the Study of American Business. "The current management of the Department boasts that it is especially effective in using its vast resources to help individual companies succeed in an increasingly competitive global marketplace," Weidenbaum said in his testimony to the House Commerce Committee.
<p>
"Of course, the relatively few who benefit from the Secretary of Commerce personally opening doors for them think this is a great idea," Weidenbaum said. "Millions of other businesses, large and small, however, pay the taxes that finance these programs. They do not benefit from this personal attention. In a nutshell, this whole process is unfair." According to Weidenbaum, most American businesses and the American economy would be better off if the money spent by the Commerce Department went to lower taxes or reduce the deficit.
<p>
Remarkably, reporters who were quick to publicize the Administration's crusade to end corporate welfare aren't suspicious when the same Administration claims it can help private companies create jobs and train employees.

<Title>Kudos: Post Looks at Regulations from Business Perspective</Title>

<center><h2>Kudos: Post Looks at Regulations from Business Perspective</h2>
</center>
<p>
The concerns of small business owners rarely make it into the stories of the Washington media (See page 2). A notable exception: the July 17 Washington Post. Staff writer Jay Matthews, in a front page story, describes how the federal regulatory maze causes one small business, the Drypers Corporation, to "fear" and "shudder" at the cost of compliance. According to Matthews, that fear can now be remedied by "a Republican led Congress [that] tries to rewrite and scale back what businesses consider irrational intrusions." Matthews gives readers a "close look at Drypers' multi-layered relationship with Washington [which] helps explain the resentment that drives this [deregulatory] campaign."
<p>
The story quotes Walter Klemp, chairman of the Texas-based diaper company, as fearing almost any new government action. Referring to the last time Congress changed tax laws, he asks: "How many volumes and rooms of tax code did they add to the whole thing the last time?" Matthews notes that "Drypers must calculate its income in one way for the [Securities and Exchange Commission] and its shareholders and in quite another way for the [Internal Revenue Service]." Other "conflicting rules" which "almost no one reads" include "a federal law that requires a plan to reduce its employees' commuting time while a state law says the company does not have to put the plan into effect." Such conflicting rules require Drypers' management to neglect their "families for weeks to produce stacks of reports," causing Klemp to declare that "government has tried too much to work social issues through business."
<p>
While Matthews didn't point out the cost of excessive regulations for consumers and society (See Editor's Note, page 8), kudos to him and the Post for reporting on how overregulation does hurt small, struggling business owners.
<p>
 MediaNomics noted recently that NBC's Lisa Myers has been emerging as one of the most original network reporters. During July, the trend continued. Last month Myers reported again on sugar subsidies for Dateline. She pointed out that the program costs consumers while a limited number of sugar growers get billions in subsidies.
<p>
Then, in a Nightly News story, she returned to the Medicare debate. Myers reported again that most recipients receive much more in benefits than they paid into the program and that Medicare's explosive growth wasn't predicted by its founders.
<p>
Myers' fact-based reporting continues to clear up the often foggy entitlements debate.

<title>Reporters Ignore Those Who Support Tax Cuts</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Economists Unanimous on Taxes? </h2>
</center>
<p>
Reporters seem to think they have found something others have been trying to find for years -- a consensus among economists.  Journalists in both the print and broadcast media are reporting that "most economists" are against Dole's tax cuts. But a recent study that actually surveyed economists finds much less agreement than the media are conveying.
<p>
"Bob Dole says his new economic plan will carry America `to the threshold of a breathtaking future.' But to many economists, it looks like `Back to the Future,'" wrote the Boston Globe's Peter G. Gosselin on August 6. "For all Dole's claims about the innovativeness of his proposal analysts said that it relies on two tried-and-troubled ideas -- spending cuts like those balked at by the public last year, and an economic payoff largely missing from the nation's last experiment with substantial tax cuts under Ronald Reagan."
<p>
Clay Chandler, in the August 6 Washington Post, agreed: "Economists, investors and budget experts yesterday questioned the validity of those assumptions and the budget numbers underlying Dole's ambitious claims." He quoted Norwest Corp.'s chief economist, Song Won Sohn, as saying, "If we were to put in a package like this, I'm concerned that income growth effects would be negative, not positive."
<p>
Broadcast reporters were equally adamant. NBC's David Bloom, on August 5, said: "Most economists say the Reagan tax cuts did worsen the budget deficit and many are skeptical of Dole's plan." 
<p>
It turns out not to be so clear, though. Professor William C. Adams of George Washington University conducted a nationwide survey of 700 members of the American Economics Association. According to Adams, the survey found "an unexpected degree of sympathy for tax cuts" as well as "an enormous diversity of opinion and no profession-wide consensus on these key issues." (See box.)
<p>
About the same percentage of economists, for instance, think federal spending caused the increased deficits of the 1980s (52) as think Reagan's tax cuts were the culprit (48). More than eight out of ten, though, agree that Reagan's tax cuts increased economic growth. A sizable minority of economists (41 percent) think Dole's plan to recapture 30 percent of the revenue lost from his tax cut through faster economic growth -- the classic supply-side argument -- is plausible. 
<p>
According to the survey, the closest thing to a consensus among economists concerns reining in spending. When asked their preferred priorities for the next Congress, a plurality (42 percent) picked cutting taxes and restraining spending. Thirty four percent chose restraining spending. In other words, a full 76 percent favor restraining spending, a story still waiting to be told in the news.

<title>Issue Review: Coverage of Business Subsidies</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Schizophrenic on Corporate Welfare</h2>
</center>
<p>
When General Colin Powell, in his speech at the Republican National Convention, challenged his party to rein in corporate welfare and not just other parts of government, reporters responded approvingly. But a look at their own past record in coverage (or lack of coverage) of subsidies to business and industry reveals that reporters themselves need to start challenging both parties on the issue.
<p>
"One of the things that I thought was interesting about Colin Powell's speech," commented MSNBC correspondent Andrea Mitchell, "is that he did talk about the hard choices and he said, `Listen friends, let me put it to you. We're going to have to give up corporate welfare as well.'" PBS anchor Charlayne Hunter-Gault said to the Family Research Council's Gary Bauer: "You heard the reaction in the room at the conclusion of the speech. You also heard Mark [Shields] say that when he talked about corporate welfare and welfare for the wealthy there was a deafening silence in the room. How do you think this crowd is really receiving this message?"
<p>
As important is how the media have received this message. For while they are interested in corporate welfare now, the real deafening silence has been in the media's coverage of business subsidies. As reported by MediaNomics in past issues, reporters over the last several months have often either ignored corporate welfare when it was a major part of a prominent issue, or they have actually promoted business subsidies.
<p>
Example: Last summer when some budget cutters in Congress were trying to cut business pork, reporters came to the rescue. CNN's Charles Bierbauer, for example, on the July 4, 1995 World News, reported on the threatened elimination of the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration (USTTA). Introducing the story, anchor Bobbie Battista described the USTTA as "the small federal agency set up to lure tourists to the U.S....now on the chopping block."
<p>
Bierbauer quoted Greg Farmer, undersecretary of commerce, defending the program: "There's a new job created every 2.5 seconds in the travel and tourism industry in the world. I want the United States to get its fair share." Is the USTTA corporate welfare? Bierbauer didn't ask. Bierbauer's conclusion: "Tourists may continue to come to the United States, of course, but they may no longer have Uncle Sam to lead them here."
<p>
John Roberts, on the June 25, 1995 CBS Evening News, warned that budget cuts may hurt summer jobs programs. "For the past 30 years," Roberts said, "kids from low-income families have had help from the federal summer jobs program, which funds student employment." Roberts quoted Labor Secretary Robert Reich as pointing out that "one-third of disadvantaged kids who get summer jobs in the private sector wind up working for the same companies in permanent jobs." So does taxpayer funding of businesses training costs constitute corporate welfare? Roberts didn't ask Reich.
<p>
A July 2, 1995 Washington Post story assumed the Commerce Department was necessary and didn't bother interviewing critics who were calling it the embodiment of corporate welfare. The entire story was from the point of view of then-Commerce Secretary Ron Brown. According to the Post, Brown, "a strong advocate of free trade, today expressed confidence `cooler heads will ultimately prevail' and his department will not be dismantled by Republicans in Congress."
<p>
The Post said the secretary had been "leading trips abroad with American businessmen in hopes of prying open overseas markets" and quoted Brown as saying that "it's unbelievable that the United States would be the only country in the world where the private sector would not have a seat at the cabinet table." The Post didn't give any space to non-administration views, such as those of economist Murray Weidenbaum of the Center for the Study of American Business. "Of course, the relatively few who benefit from the Secretary of Commerce personally opening doors for them think this is a great idea," Weidenbaum told the House Commerce Committee. "Millions of other businesses, large and small, however, pay the taxes that finance these programs. They do not benefit from this personal attention. In a nutshell, this whole process is unfair."
<p>
Sometimes journalists simply ignored corporate welfare altogether, even when it was part of an issue they were covering. This past spring, for example, most reporters accepted at face value the Clinton Adminstration's expensive plan to restore parts of the Florida Everglades. The fact that federal subsidies, supported by both the Clinton Administration and Republicans in Congress, were propping up the same sugar industry which threatened the Everglades rarely merited a mention.
<p>
The Clinton plan is "the largest infusion of federal dollars ever proposed for the Everglades, making it one of the biggest ecological restoration projects ever," cheered CBS News correspondent Art Rascon on the February 20 This Morning. Miami correspondent Peter Katel, in the March 4 Newsweek, added that "Clinton's plan is the high-water mark of reform. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and Florida's two senators have a more modest plan to spend $200 million of taxpayer funds -- not sugar money -- to buy some of the sugarcane land for water-restoration projects." On February 20 reporter Mike Clary of the Los Angeles Times called Clinton's plan "as ambitious and comprehensive as any environmental project of recent years."
<p>
But none of these reporters made the connection between the subsides provided to industry by the sugar tariff and damage to the Everglades. None asked why the government, before spending a lot of money, shouldn't just bring down the tariff. Only Eric Schmitt of the New York Times criticized the subsidies. "The government sets price supports that maintain domestic sugar prices at twice those on the world market and, according to the General Accounting Office, cost consumers $1.4 billion a year," Schmitt pointed out. "Strict quotas on cheaper foreign sugar maintain the support price levels, which critics say benefit a small number of wealthy plantation owners and encourage overproduction in environmentally sensitive areas like the Florida Everglades."
<p>
Such subsidies to business constitute some of the least defensible of federal spending programs. Although neither Republican nor Democratic politicians want to talk about corporate welfare, it has critics outside of Congress and the Clinton Administration on both the right and the left. Reporters generally cheered Colin Powell for bringing up corporate welfare in his convention speech. But when it comes to specific programs, they have usually been slow to mention corporate welfare's critics and quick to assume that business subsidies are justified.

<center><h2>Kudos: NBC's Lisa Myers and Andrea Mitchell</h2>
</center>
<p>
One of the encouraging recent trends on the evening newscasts is the development of regular segments in which reporters explore how the government often misspends taxpayers' money. As recent coverage has demonstrated, NBC Nightly News' version, "The Fleecing of America," has proven to be one of the best.
<p>
The July 10 "Fleecing of America" segment told viewers how the Social Security Administration spends tax money for union representatives who, as Tom Brokaw said, "do no work on Social Security matters." According to correspondent Lisa Myers: "Taxpayers are paying the salaries of 146 full-time employees who do not work on Social Security matters and instead spend all of their time on union activities," as well as another 1,800 who spend part of their work time engaged in union tasks. Myers reported that "under President Clinton, the cost of these union activities has doubled to almost $13 million a year."
<p>
She interviewed former SSA employees who told of the union workers' using their jobs, and therefore tax money, to promote the Democratic Party, and confronted an SSA official about such partisan ties. "This is not happening just at the Social Security Administration," she concluded, "but in virtually every other federal agency."
<p>
Correspondent Andrea Mitchell, for the August 7 segment, told viewers about an "expensive new Medicare handbook, courtesy of the U.S. Government." According to Mitchell: "The handbook is supposed to describe Medicare benefits and where to get help, basic information. It cost $2.1 million to distribute last year. But this year, an election year, it cost nine times as much -- $18 million."
<p>
Mitchell pointed out that "critics wonder, was the chief reason for this year's big cost increase politics." One of those critics, Rep. Bill Thomas, (R-Calif.) said, "The primary goal was to create a positive, warm feeling in an election year with taxpayers' dollars."
<p>
Mitchell pointed out that "a separate copy went to every American over 65. That's 37 million copies," which went even to married seniors whose spouses received a copy. She pointed out that, despite the high cost, the handbook didn't even mention one of the new programs Medicare recipients are eligible for and concluded that to many, "it reads like another chapter in the fleecing of America."
<p>
Kudos to Myers, Mitchell, and NBC for holding government to the same standards reporters have long held the private sector.

<title>Guest Review, by Linda E. Platts</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Where Science Meets Politics</h2>
</center>
<p>
Science and technology are now major players in the public policy arena. While much of the media ignore the science behind many political issues, at least one show takes it on squarely. TechnoPolitics, a half-hour public television show, is helping its viewers make sense out of technical information and also see how the policies that evolve will affect their lives.
<p>
Hosted by James K. Glassman, a Washington Post columnist who also hosts CNN's Capital Gang Sunday, TechnoPolitics is designed to "distinguish the science from the politics in policy debates," according to the producers. Thus, it deals with issues such as electronic communications, air defense, fat substitutes, medical research, and global warming.
<p>
The show delves into one topic at length and then follows with a briefer look at two other subjects. Film clips provide background information usually followed by a debate by experts representing both sides of the issue.
<p>
What distinguishes TechnoPolitics from other shows dealing with topical issues is its willingness to air views that get short shrift elsewhere. In a recent show, the World Bank came under close scrutiny. It is supported by the American taxpayers to the tune of $789 million a year and relies on the American government to guarantee its loans. Glassman dug in with queries on the bank's hefty salaries, its new $314 million headquarters, and its often risky loans, which no private bank would consider.
<p>
For another show, TechnoPolitics tackled pornography on the Internet. One side weighed in with the view that children must be protected at all costs and government control is essential. The opposing side suggested parents should do their jobs, rather than allow the government to gain a foothold on the free flow of information over the Internet. Another emotionally charged issue tackled recently by TechnoPolitics was medical research using animals. News footage with an animal rights activist and a patient battling AIDS introduced the segment, then in the studio two scientists presented contradictory "scientific" evidence. There were no clear winners or losers in this debate, but it highlighted the complexity of making public policy about animal testing.
<p>
Whether the subject is a replacement for the F-16 or saving human lives, TechnoPolitics doesn't shy away from the hard issues. The joint strike fighter, for instance, is intended to meet the needs of all the military services, but the development time, as Glassman noted, stretched well into the next century. Even more attention to the costs behind the science would be a welcome addition.
<p>
The last segment of each show does not examine an issue so much as raise an interesting subject. A New York Times reporter told how alternative medicines can deter patients from seeking effective treatment from conventional sources. A writer from Scientific American explained that all great scientific discoveries have already been made and from now on we will just be refining the details. Interesting, yes, but there is no debate and viewers are left in limbo waiting for the point that is never made. TechnoPolitics might be better leaving these stories to another program and sticking with the clear, rapid exchange of views that distinguishes the earlier portions of the program.
<p>
TechnoPolitics is produced by the Blackwell Corporation in association with South Carolina Educational Television and it is distributed by the Public Broadcasting System. It is broadcast on 180 stations and reaches 40 of the top 50 markets. It airs on Sunday mornings in most markets.

<Title>Tax Cuts Concern Reporters, Medicare Increases Don't</Title>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Deficit Chicken Hawks</h2>

<p>
Bob Dole pledged to cut income taxes by 15 percent, balance the
budget, and leave Social Security and Medicare untouched. Toughminded
reporters believed none of it and shared their skepticism with
a national television audience,&quot; writes the Weekly Standard's
David Frum in the September 9 issue of that magazine.
<P>
But then, according to Frum, &quot;Two weeks later, the Democrats met in
convention and, to put it simply, lied through their teeth about
their plans for Medicare. They accused Republicans, in Al Gore's
words, of wanting to `give health insurance ripoff artists a license
to change Medicare, to let this program for our seniors wither
on the vine. That's why they want to replace Bill Clinton. But
we won't let them.' Those remarks are blatantly untrue, both about
the Republican plans and about Clinton's own. And the media said...nothing.&quot;
<P>
Is Frum correct? Are reporters more skeptical of Bob Dole's tax rhetoric
than of Bill Clinton's Medicare rhetoric? Media Research Center
analysts reviewed all of the stories about either tax cuts or
Medicare on ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly
News, and CNN's World Today during the month of August. The MRC's
findings: While network journalists were ardent deficit hawks
when reporting on tax cuts, they lost their deficitcutting zeal
when Democrats denounced Republican Medicare plans.There were
a total of 24 stories during the month that questioned whether
Bob Dole could both cut taxes and balance the budget. Only two
stories questioned whether Bill Clinton could erase the deficit
while not advancing Medicare reforms in his second term.The reaction
to the unveiling of Dole's tax plan was the same across the networks.
&quot;Since Dole would leave Social Security, Medicare, and defense
untouched,&quot; reported CBS News correspondent Phil Jones, &quot;it's
still unclear what would be cut in order to pay for his tax cut.&quot;
According to CNN's Gene Randall, &quot;Bob Dole has produced an
economic plan that is getting mixed reviews even from Republicans.
The bipartisan Concord Coalition on Sunday warned against electionyear
taxcut Santas.&quot;
<P>
NBC's Mike Jensen offered that &quot;most
analysts say it's not good economics. Bob Dole says about a fourth
of the tax cuts would be paid for by an expanding economy, but
the rest would have to come from spending cuts, and those haven't
been spelled out yet.&quot; Over at ABC, correspondent John Cochran
claimed that &quot;if critics say Dole's tax plan would lead to
budget deficits of the size of those dating back to the Reagan
era, then his campaign simply isn't going to worry about it for
now.&quot;
<P>
But what about Bill Clinton and Medicare? Economics
columnist Robert Samuelson, in the September 4 Washington Post,
pointed out that in the upcoming years &quot;the only way to avoid
(or minimize) much higher taxes, the [Congressional Budget Office]
said, would be a mix of an older retirement age, reduced benefits
and a shift of Medicare toward managed care. On Medicare, the
Republicans proposed precisely such a shift...Clinton's demolition
of this effort confounds the CBO's sensible advice.&quot;
<P>
Only
two network reporters questioned whether leaving Medicare alone
could be compatible with balanced budgets. &quot;A generation
of baby boomers begins retiring within a decade,&quot; ABC's Jerry
King pointed out. &quot;So, the bad news is, unless the politicians
find a way to cut entitlement spending, today's deficit reductions
will be impossible to sustain.&quot; ABC's Jeff Greenfield reported
that &quot;with the huge baby boomer generation retiring in about
15 years, those entitlement programs could take every single dollar
of the budget.&quot;
<P>
King and Greenfield were the only reporters
concerned about how to &quot;pay for&quot; automatic Medicare
spending increases. If Bill Clinton won't reform Medicare in his
next term, why aren't reporters asking him which taxes he will
raise?

<Title>Issue Analysis: The Media Versus Tobacco</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Addicted to Tobacco Stories, Part II</h2>
</center>
<p>
 Which is worse, a legal product that if used over many decades can be lifethreatening,
or an illegal product that can be of more immediate danger?
<P>
For
America's news media, the answer is overwhelmingly the former.
Over a recent twelvemonth period, television news has devoted
significantly more air time to reporting on tobacco than to reporting
on cocaine, heroin, LSD, and marijuana combined.
<P>
This is one finding
of a special yearlong Media Research Center study of news coverage
of risky products and the industries which make and sell them.
Tobacco and the tobacco industry received more negative coverage
by far than any other risky legal product, such as dietary fat
and the food industry, automobiles and the auto industry, alcohol
and the alcohol industry, and pesticides and the chemical industry.
Tobacco even received more coverage than illegal drugs. This media
obsession with tobacco affected coverage of other issues as well,
even coverage of the 1996 presidential campaign. 
<P>
Media Research
Center analysts reviewed all of the stories about several risky
products on network morning and evening news shows between August
1, 1995 and August 1, 1996. There were 413 stories during that
twelvemonth period about tobacco; there were 340 stories about
illegal drugs. This disparity was present despite welldocumented
rapid increases in the use of illegal drugs over the past few
years, notably among teenagers.
<P>
Among the print media, the disparity
has been even greater. A Nexis search of headlines in American
newspapers finds that the terms &quot;tobacco or smoking or cigarette&quot;
were employed 26,546 times between January 1, 1993 and September
9, 1996. Over the same time period, the terms &quot;cocaine or
heroin or LSD or illegal drugs&quot; were used only 8,501 times.
In other words, there were more than three times as many stories
focusing on tobacco than there were stories focusing on illegal
drugs.
<P>
President Clinton has helped put the tobacco story on the
map. Eightyfive of the television news tobacco stories were about
the Clinton Administration's attacks on the tobacco industry.
Almost all of the stories were upbeat about Clinton's attempts
to regulate tobacco, portraying him as courageously taking on
a powerful industry. NBC's Bryant Gumbel, for instance, announced
on the August 11, 1995 Today that &quot;in a historic move the
Clinton Administration has declared nicotine to be a drug and
has proposed regulations aimed at curbing smoking by teenagers.&quot;
According to CBS' John Roberts, on the August 10, 1995 This Morning,
&quot;President Clinton is stepping up federal efforts to harness
smoking among teenagers. He'll detail some tough new measures
today that are sure to put him at odds with the powerful tobacco
lobby.&quot;
<P>
But when the issue was the increases in illegal drug
use, Clinton was mentioned only in 45 stories, and most of those
mentions were positive. Again, the disparity is revealing. The
same reporters who are willing to accept Clinton's premise that
government policies can discourage smoking behavior among the
young demand little accountability from him for increased illegal
drug use. And there was rarely even the suggestion in the media
that the president was playing up the tobacco issue to hide how
much illegal drug use had increased during his watch.
<P>
Among the
print media, the same disparity was present. A Nexis search reveals
that there were 4,057 stories between January 1, 1993 and September
9, 1996 that had &quot;tobacco or smoking or cigarette&quot; in
the headline and a reference to Bill Clinton in the body of the
story. Stories with the terms &quot;cocaine or heroin or LSD or
illegal drugs&quot; in the headline and a reference to Clinton
in the body of the story numbered 381.
<P>
This singling out of tobacco
had effects on 1996 campaign coverage. Normally, when a politician
radically changes positions on an issue, it's big news. For instance,
there were several evening news stories during the 1996 Republican
National Convention about Jack Kemp altering his positions on
illegal immigration and affirmative action once he became the
Republican vicepresidential candidate. &quot;
<P>
The quarterback became
the acrobat today,&quot; reported ABC's Jackie Judd on the August
14, 1996 World News Tonight. &quot;Kemp was flipflopping on long
held positions.&quot; She noted that these changes &quot;left
at least one delegate here feeling abandoned&quot; and that &quot;Kemp's
change in position on these core issues fights the very image
that he's built for himself as an independent thinker.&quot; According
to Dan Rather, on that same night's CBS Evening News, &quot;Bob
Dole has reversed himself on deficit reduction versus tax cuts.
Jack Kemp has reversed himself on how he feels about immigration.&quot;
Rather wondered: &quot;Isn't that, or is it, going to make it
more difficult to attack Bill Clinton on the character issue?&quot;
<P>
But
these bloodhounds sniffing out hypocrisy turned quiet when Vice
President Al Gore radically changed his position on tobacco. In
his speech to the Democratic National Convention, Gore said that
his sister's death from lung cancer in 1984 prompted his antitobacco
crusade. None of the network evening newscasts pointed out that
in 1988, he boasted to tobacco growers that &quot;throughout most
of my life, I raised tobacco. I want you to know that with my
own hands, all of my life, I put it in the plant beds and transferred
it. I've hoed it. I've dug it in. I've sprayed it, I've chopped
it, I've shredded it, spiked it, put it in the barn and stripped
it and sold it.&quot; Apparently, politicians changing their positions
cannot go unpunished by the media unless they result in the politician
becoming an antitobacco zealot.
<P>
The disparity between tobacco and
other legal products was even greater. On television  during the
same time period in which there were 413 stories about tobacco
 there were 136 stories about dietary fat and obesity; there were
94 stories about auto safety; there were only 58 stories related
to alcohol and health.As MediaNomics reported two months ago,
the disparity between reporting on tobacco and reporting on dietary
fat and obesity is especially curious. The same health advocates
who tell us that tobacco contributes to 400,000 deaths in the
U.S. each year also report that obesity contributes to 300,000
deaths in the U.S. per year. Reporters acknowledged this risk.
&quot;Obesity, of course, is a major health problem in this country,&quot;
Tom Brokaw reported on the April 29, 1996 Nightly News. &quot;It
is estimated that it's responsible for 300,000 deaths a year from
heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and the like.&quot;
Other reporters pointed out that obesity during pregnancy can
cause birth defects and other serious problems in babies. One
reporter, ABC's John McKenzie, insisted that even one highfat
meal, if eaten at an inopportune moment, can be dangerous. But
there were still only onefourth the number of stories on obesity
and dietary fat as there were stories about tobacco. 
<P>
There was
also a different standard of judgment for the industries that
make and sell other risky products. They were never subjected
to nearly the same hostility that the tobacco industry endured.
There were no stories, for example, about fastfood advertising
enticing kids and others to consume products that may one day
kill them. Nor were there any stories pointing out the medical
costs of obesity. And no network reporter sought to outline the
campaign contributions of companies which produce and sell alcohol.
But all the networks were critical of tobacco advertising and
campaign contributions, as well as the medical costs to society
of smokingrelated illnesses.
<P>
Journalists seem to have lost some
perspective when reporting on tobacco. They not only air far more
stories on tobacco than on other legal, risky products, but they
have allowed Clinton to use smoking to deflect attention from
rising illegal drug use. Reporters should not ignore tobacco,
but they should not apply to it a harsher standard than they apply
to even illegal drugs.Editor's note: This issue analysis is adapted
from a longer Media Research Center special report about media
coverage of both legal and illegal risky products and the industries
which produce them.

<Title>Guest Editorial, by Laurence A. Jarvik</Title>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>PBS: Already Commercial</h2>
</center>
<p>
In all of the heated debate about privatizing
public broadcasting, one observation has struck me most forcefully
about PBS: It is a fact seldom commented upon that many PBS shows
have had their roots firmly fixed in commercial soil from their
inception. Many of public television's bestknown offerings are
either transfers from the networks, adaptations from them (often
using the same personnel), or purchases (on a commercial basis)
from British television companies (including such forprofit competitors
of the BBC as Thames Television).
<P>
The <I>MacNeil-Lehrer Report</I>, for
instance, was produced by a team from NBC News and resembled the
<I>Huntley-Brinkley</I> Report. Bill Moyers shuttled between PBS and <I>CBS
News</I>. William F. Buckley's <I>Firing Line</I> had run on RKO General
stations before moving to PBS. <I>Frontline's</I> first anchorwoman was
NBC News' Jessica Savitch. The American Experience was headed
by veteran Moyers' producers from CBS News. National Geographic
specials were simply moved from CBS. Ken Burns' The Civil War
was sponsored by General Motors.
<P>
Sesame Street was produced by the makers of CBS's Captain Kangaroo. British comedies like Monty
Python's Flying Circus were sold profitably to individual stations,
as were howto programs such as This Old House and The French Chef.
Masterpiece Theatre and Mystery! were brought to PBS by the Mobil
Corporation. The story of Milton Friedman's Free to Choose is
a case study of how private sponsorship made possible a major
PBS miniseries. 
<P>
One could choose a different selection of programs
to analyze, but it would be difficult to find truly excellent
PBS fare which did not have some commercial connection. It is
precisely these market forces which serve to improve the range,
quality, and choice of programs on public broadcasting.
<P>
The extent
to which public broadcasting had developed into a large, powerful,
and wealthy establishment over the past three decades remained
largely obscured from public view prior to 1992, when political
deliberation over continued funding for the system began in earnest.
As a result of the subsequent years of debate and disclosure there
is now a bipartisan consensus in Washington that public broadcasting
can be selfsupporting. In 1996 Congressman Jack Fields, chairman
of the House Telecommunications Subcommittee, introduced what
he called the &quot;Public Broadcasting SelfSufficiency Act.&quot;
Although I have opposed such a billiondollar final payment to
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (as a &quot;trust fund&quot;),
no one has come forward to publicly argue against the principle
of selfreliance.
<P>
Indeed, a January 1996 public opinion survey commissioned
by CPB found broad support among the American public for PBS sales
of videotapes and merchandise, commercials, retail stores, online
computer services, and mailorder catalogs. Fiftyseven percent
of those asked said, &quot;The more sales the better.&quot; Eightysix
percent agreed that &quot;sponsorship announcements are okay because
public broadcasting has to do something to raise money in the
face of the decreased support from the federal government.&quot;
That is, the public now accepts that educational and cultural
programming on PBS can be successfully supported by private revenue
streams.
<P>
A system which began with a $5 million appropriation for
CPB in 1967 has grown over thirty years into a multibillion dollar
worldwide multimedia empire. With over a thousand public radio
and television stations, public broadcasting is now the largest
network in the United States. When judged by the number of stations,
National Public Radio, the Public Broadcasting Service, Pacifica,
and Public Radio International are bigger than Fox, CBS, NBC,
or ABC.
<P>
In addition to their on-air activities, public broadcasters
publish magazines and newsletters; provide computer programs,
online services, sites on the World Wide Web, study guides and
textbooks; host conferences; license toys, games, and clothing;
produce stage shows; sell products through mail order catalogs
and retail stores; and distribute videocassettes and compact disks.
From these activities a large industry has grown to parallel commercial
broadcasting. And, just like other telecommunications giants,
public broadcasting spends millions on public relations firms
and lawyers to lobby Congress.
<P>
The political issue of &quot;zeroing
out&quot; federal subsidies is no longer a matter of &quot;if&quot;
but merely a matter of &quot;when.&quot; For the evidence is clear
and convincing: public broadcasting does not need tax dollars
in order to do its job.

<CENTER><H2>Studies on Religion, Economy Available</H2></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
The Media Research Center has produced a new landmark study of how news and 
entertainment television treat religion. Faith in a Box, 1994 builds on the 
1993 study of the same name, which found that religion received poor treatment 
in both the news and on prime time.
In the 1994 study, the MRC found marked improvement in Hollywood's depiction of 
religion, but network news continued to trivialize or downplay religious 
themes.
<P>
As was the case with its 1993 predecessor, Faith in a Box, 1994 was recently 
released to the media in Hollywood and Washington, and distributed to 
conservative and religious activists nationwide.
<P>
Leaders in the entertainment industry, including network executives, have been 
briefed on the MRC's findings as well, and given the MRC's recommendations on 
improving religious portrayals on their television shows.
<P>
To obtain a copy of Faith in a Box, 1994, please call 1-800-MRC-1423 or write 
to us at: Media Research Center, 113 S. West Street, Suite 200, Alexandria, VA 
22314.
<P>
MediaNomics readers still have a chance to obtain Out of Focus: Network 
Television and the American Economy by MediaNomics editor Burton Yale Pines, as 
well.
<P>
Out of Focus takes an in-depth look at an entire year's network reporting on 
such as issues as health care reform, environmental policy, taxes, government 
spending, business, and consumer affairs. The book also looks into the impact 
of prime-time entertainment television on the culture of free enterprise and 
business.
<P>
According to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, "Out of Focus is a major blast at 
American network television. It deserves the attention of thinking Americans."
National Review agreed: "Out of Focus does for TV viewers what Consumer Reports 
does for car buyers, exposing the recurring flaws in the reports of Ray Brady, 
Irving R. Levine, most of the CNN staff, and the like."

<CENTER><H2>Letting Government Polluters off the Hook</H2></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
For reporters, industry is always the polluter; government is always the 
protector. When it's government programs, such as subsidies for pesticide-using 
farmers, that encourage pollution, reporters are silent.
<P>
Robert Hager's August 8 NBC Nightly News story was a case in point. He began: 
"The purity of the water we drink, the air we breathe, the food we eat. For two 
decades the Environmental Protection Agency has led the clean-up." From 
corporations pouring dioxin into the Great Lakes to protection of wetlands, 
"which prevent flooding and permit wildfowl to breathe." According to Hager, 
House efforts to rein in the EPA would bring "the first big slowdown in 
environmental clean-up since the 1970s."
<P>
But what if the government is the culprit? Take the Everglades. As Jonathan 
Tolman of the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) points out, the U.S. sugar 
program, by subsidizing sugar production, is responsible for much of "the 
increased phosphorus contamination of the Everglades which is disrupting the 
unique nature of the ecosystem." Tolman also lit into the USDA peanut program, 
which not only "costs consumers $500 million a year in higher peanut prices," 
but increases pesticide use by permitting peanuts to be grown in just a handful 
of counties.
<P>
Elimination of farm subsidies has been advocated by environmentalists of all  
political stripes, from the free-market CEI to the liberal Wilderness Society. 
Only reporters are letting government off the hook.

<CENTER><H3>Medicare Reporting Improving, But...</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
In June, MediaNomics described how TV network news reporters were incorrectly 
characterizing Republican plans to slow the rate of Medicare's growth. During 
the study period, reporters called GOP plans "cuts" twice as often as they 
correctly called GOP plans "slowing Medicare's growth."
<P>
Since then, there has been a dramatic improvement in network labeling. Now, 
half of the time network reporters get it right labeling Medicare reform plans. 
Media-Nomics analysts reviewed all of the stories about Medicare on network 
evening newscasts from July 15 to August 15. In the 15 stories, there were 24 
references to either the GOP plan or the Clinton plan to reform Medicare. 
Twelve of the references labeled the plans "cuts" or "reductions." An equal 
number of references labeled the plans as slowing the rate of increase in 
Medicare.
<P>
There is, however, still some confusion. Many reporters now use the terms "cut" 
and "slow the growth" interchangeably, sometimes even in the same story. CNN's 
Catherine Calaway, for instance, on the July 25 World News, referred to 
Medicare "spending cuts," but then, two sentences later, said: "Both parties 
hope to slow Medicare growth, but Republicans would go further."
<P>
Her CNN colleague, Jill Dougherty, did the same four days later. On the July 29 
World News she reported on "Republican plans to cut the growth in Medicare 
spending," but then later in the story alluded to "the $270 billion in 
GOP-proposed cuts." On the next day's World News Dougherty again clouded the 
issue. After first reporting that "Republicans propose cutting Medicare's 
growth by $270 billion," she mentioned charges that "Republican cuts are just a 
cover for the $245 billion they want to give away in tax cuts." 
<P>
Later in the story she said the GOP was "intent on giving voters a balanced 
budget along with hefty tax cuts, and it's hard to see any way to do that 
without taking something out of Medicare."
<P>
The other networks were similarly sloppy. On the July 25 World News Tonight, 
for example, ABC reporter Rebecca Chase pointed out that "both parties propose 
slowing the growth of Medicare spending," but then later talked about how much 
they would "reduce" Medicare spending. At CBS, reporter Bob Orr said: 
"Republicans want to reduce the growth in Medicare spending by $270 billion 
over the next seven years, more the double the $124 billion reduction proposed 
by the White House." But as he was saying this, viewers saw a graphic on screen 
with the same numbers, only under the headline "Proposed Medicare Cuts." 
Viewers presumably must have wondered if Medicare spending was being cut or 
merely slowed.
<P>
The most frequently mentioned number in network Medicare stories was $270 
billion -- the amount by which Republicans propose to slow the projected growth 
of Medicare. It was cited by ABC's Rebecca Chase and Bob Zelnick, CBS's Bob 
Orr, CNN's Jill Dougherty (twice), and NBC's Joe Johns (although Johns called 
it a cut, saying seniors were "angry over Republican plans to reduce Medicare 
spending $270 billion.").
<P>
According to ABC's Zelnick, for example: "Republicans want to cut $270 billion 
from projected cost increases during that time." These reports (except for 
Johns') were true, as far as they went. But they still gave the impression that 
reform meant fewer dollars for Medicare recipients. A clearer way of phrasing 
it would have been: "Republicans would allow the program to grow by $105 
billion over the next seven years instead of the projected $375 billion."
<P>
Only one reporter, CBS's Rita Braver, pointed out that spending per recipient 
would increase over the next seven years under the Republican plan. On the July 
25 CBS Evening News, after running soundbites from Democrat politicians calling 
on Republicans to keep their "greedy" hands off Medicare, Braver put things in 
perspective: "Republicans argue they don't want to cut Medicare, just control 
its growth, spending only $6,700 per capita instead of $8,000 per capita  in 
2002." A graphic on screen clearly showed that spending under the Republican 
plan would increase from $4,800 per recipient to $6,700 per recipient in 2002.
While reporters have improved the accuracy of their Medicare reform labels, 
there are still some of the same weaknesses in Medicare reports that 
MediaNomics identified three months ago. In soundbite selection, for example, 
reporters still overwhelming favor politicians over economists and others who 
could give non-political angles.
<P>
Twenty-five soundbites were from politicians (14 Democrats and 11 Republicans), 
as well as a story-length interview of former Republican Senator Warren Rudman 
by NBC's Brian Williams on the July 27 Nightly News. Only three soundbites, and 
no lengthy interviews, were from economists. And two of those were in one 
story, a July 27 Nightly News report by NBC's Lisa Myers.
<P>
And when it came to the views of ordinary Americans, most reporters seemed to 
agree with NBC's Brian Williams who claimed, on the July 29 Nightly News, that 
the elderly "would be most affected by GOP plans to fix the cost of Medicare." 
There were seven soundbites from elderly Americans who benefit from Medicare. 
There was only one soundbite -- again in Myers' July 27 story -- from someone 
younger who supports today's retirees while knowing they will get less support 
in their old age.
<P>
Only three of the 15 reports, in fact, covered more than the usual political 
angles of Medicare. One was Braver's July 25 CBS Evening News report mentioned 
earlier. She was the only reporter to point out just how much more will be 
spent per recipient under Republican plans. 
<P>
Another was a July 25 World News Tonight story by ABC's Rebecca Chase. She told 
viewers that "Medicare spending has gone from $7 billion [in 1970] to $159 
billion today." She added that "spending, now rising 10 percent a year, must be 
controlled, because in another 15 years the great wave of baby boomers, the 
largest generation ever, will be eligible for Medicare." No other reporter told 
of those numbers.
<P>
The most informative story was Myers' July 27 Nightly News report. She touched 
bases every other reporter missed, such as the fact that the average recipient 
will receive over $100,000 more in benefits than he or she paid in Medicare 
taxes and that the Johnson Administration was almost $100 billion short in its 
projection of what the cost would be in 1990. She also interviewed a Medicare 
expert, rather than just politicians, and a worker whose taxes support 
Medicare, rather than just elderly Medicare recipients.
<P>
But most of the network Medicare reporting, while improving, is still hamstrung 
by a narrow focus on the politics of the issue and an unwillingness to 
distinguish between a cut and slowed growth. If reporters want to help the 
public understand the continually explosive Medicare issue this fall, they will 
focus less on the politics of the issue and more on the numbers behind the 
crisis.

<CENTER><H3>Train Wreck or Fender Bender?</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
Washington is abuzz with talk of an impending budgetary "train wreck." To most 
Americans this conjures up the image of gruesome wreckage and bloody 
casualties. But the truth is that the budget train wreck should have little if 
any impact on the lives of ordinary Americans even if it forces a temporary 
shutdown of the federal government. The only forces that will collide in 
October will be the two competing philosophies of governance of a Democrat 
President and a Republican Congress. Reporters should, therefore, be careful 
about calling the impasse a crisis.
<P>
To be precise, there are actually two potential budget train wrecks ahead. The 
first would occur if President Clinton vetoes any or all of the 13 
congressional appropriations bills. If spending programs have not received an 
appropriation before the start of the fiscal year on  October 1, then no money 
can be spent on the programs. Only "essential" functions, such as defense, law 
enforcement, and air traffic control, would continue to operate.
The second train wreck would occur if President Clinton vetoed the debt 
extension bill. The current debt ceiling of $5 trillion is expected to be 
reached by late October. Mr. Clinton might veto an extension because 
Republicans plan to attach welfare reform, Medicare savings, and tax cuts to 
the debt ceiling. If the ceiling is not raised on time, then the federal 
government is legally prohibited from continuing to borrow. It can continue to 
spend the money that is collected in taxes, but it cannot borrow to send out 
Social Security checks, veterans benefits, payments to defense contractors, and 
so forth.
<P>
How should the press cover this melodrama? Some tips:
<P>
First, a budget train wreck would be neither disastrous nor unprecedented. 
Ronald Reagan closed down the government for a day on several occasions as a 
result of policy disputes with Congress. Then, the circumstances were reversed: 
Reagan vetoed congressional appropriations bills because they spent too much, 
not too little. Moreover, even if the impasse between Congress and the White 
House lasted for several or even many more days, since essential government 
services would continue, only nonurgent federal spending would be halted. 
Surely few would be hurt if Head Start funding or NEA grants were discontinued 
for a few days.
<P>
Second, White House claims that the GOP budget includes deep, mean-spirited 
cuts should be greeted with skepticism. The GOP budget would allow federal 
spending to climb by $350 billion over the next seven years. The President 
wants to spend an extra $600 billion over this same period. Like the dispute 
over school lunch programs earlier this year, the debate is really about how 
much more should be spent on social programs.
<P>
Third, the charge that the GOP plan includes substantial tax cuts for the rich 
lacks factual support. Of the $250 billion tax cut package that will soon be 
agreed to by the House and Senate, the vast majority of the benefits accrue to 
working class Americans with children. The middle-class child tax credit is 
about four times as expensive as the capital gains tax cut. And this child 
credit is very similar to the middle-class tax cut Bill Clinton promised in 
1992. The official Joint Tax Committee finds that the House GOP tax package 
provides the largest percentage reduction in taxes to Americans with incomes 
between $30,000 and $75,000.
<P>
Fourth, the President may not be altogether hostile to the idea of a short-term 
shutdown of the government. During some past shutdowns of the federal 
government, few Americans even noticed. A several-day closure of non-essential 
federal activities may not be the doomsday scenario outside of Washington that 
it is perceived to be inside the beltway. This train wreck may have no 
casualties.
<P>
Fifth, the underlying policy disagreement between the President and Congress is 
whether there should be a balanced budget by 2002. The core dispute between the 
Congress and the President is not over tax cuts, Medicare savings, or welfare 
reform. The fundamental disagreement is whether the nation should be set on a 
course toward a balanced budget.
<P>
The budgetary showdown will, of course, be big news. But reporters should 
refrain from calling a temporary shutdown of the government a crisis when most 
Americans' lives will be changed very little. If reporters cry wolf too often, 
people may stop listening.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
Small, ugly Ferengi represent sci-fi series' vision of business owners
Many observers have noted the exceptional nature of the Star Trek shows. 
According to TV Guide, for instance: "The Star Trek series and films can, in 
theory, foster deeper understanding and better communication among people. But 
do they?" When it comes to race relations, the value of friendship, and the 
virtue of loyalty, the Star Trek shows do. But when it comes to business, 
economics, and the profit motive, they do not.
<P>
The only regular characters on the Star Trek shows who engage in commerce are 
the Ferengi. They are a small, ugly species. They care only about profit and 
seem to think that the best way to earn a profit is to cheat and trick 
customers, even each other. They are disdained by nearly every other species, 
which, it is made clear, have evolved beyond the profit motive.
<P>
The Ferengi have the highest profile role on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, the 
third incarnation of the Star Trek series. Almost all of the show's non-Ferengi 
regular characters promote virtue and bring honor to their jobs. They lead 
admirable lives. Viewers, last season, saw the stoic Commander Sisko devote his 
life to his son and his crew. They saw Major Kira, a former terrorist, become a 
trusted crew member.
<P>
Odo, a Changeling (one who can change form at will) and the space station's 
head of security, defies his own aggressive species when they threaten his 
friends on the station. Viewers learn that Doctor Bashir chose medicine as a 
profession because it would allow him "to help people." Lieutenant Dax, Sisko's 
confidant, is reliable and wise. And Chief O'Brien puts the happiness of his 
wife, a botanist turned teacher, above his own happiness.
<P>
But then there's Quark, a Ferengi business owner on the space station. Quark 
runs a bar and gambling casino. He puts nothing ahead of profit, except perhaps 
saving his own skin. For instance, on the October 1, 1994 episode, Sisko is 
assigned to establish relations with a relatively unknown species. He wants 
Quark to go along on the dangerous mission because the Ferengi have done 
business with the species. Quark is reluctant and recommends sending his 
brother, Ram, instead. "Ram only has a son to think about. I have a business," 
Quark pleads.
<P>
On the October 15, 1994 episode, a Klingon is accidentally killed in Quark's 
bar. The bar had been doing poorly, but the killing attracts the morbid 
curiosity of onlookers. Quark, to keep their interest, concocts an elaborate 
story about how he killed the Klingon. Business booms, but Ram is worried about 
his brother's ploy. Quark remains steadfast: "Look at that crowd. How long has 
it been since you've seen that many customers waiting to get in here? This is 
an opportunity to turn everything around."
<P>
On the May 20, 1995 episode, Quark visits the Ferengi home planet and viewers 
learn that Ferengi women are not allowed to wear clothes, address men they do 
not know, and, most of all, earn a profit. Quark's mother is accused of all 
three and Quark is held responsible. The clear message: Everything about the 
Ferengi, including the pursuit of profit, is antediluvian. In the same episode, 
one of Quark's relatives decides to join Star Fleet. Quark is livid: "He's a 
disgrace to this family and to Ferengi everywhere. He should be here, helping 
us earn a profit, not in his room learning how to be more like a human."
<P>
On the February 25 episode, the Grand Nagus, who is the leader of the Ferengi 
people, is abducted and brainwashed by aliens. When he returns he seeks to 
reform the Ferengi way of life, to make Ferengi less interested in profit. 
Quark confronts the aliens, who explain their disgust of profit: "We found the 
concept aggressive, adversarial, dangerous. We could not comprehend how any 
species could lead such a barren existence."
<P>
Quark then threatens that if the aliens don't restore the Grand Nagus to his 
former self, more Ferengi would come and bother them. Only then do they agree 
to restore the Nagus. From what viewers see of the Ferengi, who could blame 
them?
<P>
Such depictions of the Ferengi are typical, and there are no positive business 
characters balancing such portrayals. On Star Trek, viewers see people of 
different races, even different species, working together for a common cause 
and putting others ahead of themselves. Unfortunately, business isn't part of 
this vision; rather it's seen as fit only for a small, ugly, less-than-evolved 
subspecies.

<center><h2>Reporters Say American Dream
Stolen</h2>
</center>
<p>
&quot;America: Who Stole the Dream?&quot; was the provocative
title of a recent tenpart Philadelphia Inquirer series, published
nationally in KnightRidder newspapers, by PulitzerPrize winning
journalists Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele. Their answer
to the series' title question: freemarket proponents and foreigners.
But in their lengthy series they didn't mention some important
facts that critics have since pointed out.
<P>
Free trade was one of
Barlett and Steele's main villains. Instead of creating jobs in
export industries, low American tariffs have &quot;wiped out jobs
and driven down wages.&quot; Barlett and Steele lamented that
in 1996, &quot;the United States will record its 21st consecutive
merchandise trade deficit  a record unmatched by any other developed
country.&quot; America's other big economic problem, according
to Barlett and Steele, is immigration to the U.S. &quot;No other
industrial country has allowed in so many workers in so short
a time, depressing wages and living standards.&quot;
<P>
While these
policies are good for big business in the short term, the two
reporters suggest that American workers may be on the verge of
starting a revolution. They quoted a Kansas factory worker as
saying: &quot;Are we just going to keep lowering our standard
of living? When that happens, nobody is going to have money to
put food on the table. Then you are going to see a revolution,
because people are not going to be able to feed their families.&quot;
A Pennsylvania factory worker told the duo that &quot;there's
going to be bloodshed before we get out of this.&quot; These workers,
Barlett and Steele informed readers, &quot;reflect a largely silent
but growing sentiment&quot; in the U.S. Profiles of people with
such sentiments dominated the series. The two reporters proposed
restricting immigration and hiking tariffs.
<P>
The reaction to the
series was quick and severe. Economics columnist Robert Samuelson
called it &quot;junk journalism&quot; in a September 18 Washington
Post column. &quot;What [the series] doesn't say is that the trade
balance and employment are hardly connected,&quot; he wrote. Samuelson
pointed out that the trade surpluses of Germany, the Netherlands,
and Sweden  which Barlett and Steele envy  haven't kept those
countries from having far higher unemployment rates than the United
States. According to Samuelson, Barlett and Steele reported such
matters &quot;so select ively...that ordinary readers are misled.&quot;
<P>
The reporters' selective use of anecdotes and statistics bothered
George Washington University's Steve Suranovic. In a September
25 letter to the Inquirer, Suranovic wrote that it is easy for
reporters &quot;to choose individuals whose stories confirm their
conclusions.&quot; He argued that Barlett and Steele could have
&quot;found workers with new jobs in export industries earning
higherthanaverage wages&quot; and &quot;profiled  a couple of
millionaires with middleclass backgrounds who created export industries
employing thousands of workers. Bill Gates springs to mind.&quot;
<P>
The Cato Institute's Stuart Anderson argued that Barlett and Steele
misled readers about the economic effects of immigration. In an
October 14 Investor's Business Daily editorial, Anderson pointed
out that having more people in the U.S. does not lead to more
unemployment. The reason: &quot;While immigrants do increase the
supply of labor, they also increase the demand for labor.&quot;
His proof: As immigration and trade deficits have increased over
the past 20 years, and total employment has increased 59 percent,
&quot;the unemployment rate has dropped from 7.7 percent to 5.2
percent.&quot; According to Anderson, &quot;Even the total number
of unemployed people in the country has dropped.&quot;
<P>
The views
of Samuelson, Suranovic, and Anderson are held by enough economists
that they should be discussed in any major, tenpart economic series
that purports to be serious journalism.

<Title>Issue Analysis: Global Economy As a News Story,
1991-1992 vs. 1995-1996</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Deficit in Trade Reporting</h2>
</center>
<p>
International trade has almost ceased to be an issue to report on for the network
news media. This is in stark contrast to 1991 and 1992, when the
media reported heavily on trade as an electionyear issue. As a
result, the trade deficit  though large  is not nearly the negative
story (except in KnightRidder papers, see page one) for President
Clinton that it was for President Bush. Media Research Center (MRC)
analysts reviewed all of the stories about foreign trade on ABC's
World News Tonight, CBS <I>Evening News</I> and NBC <I>Nightly News</I> between
July 1, 1991 and June 30, 1992. There were 134 trade stories during
this period. MRC analysts also reviewed all of the stories about
foreign trade on the same shows between July 1, 1995 and June
30, 1996. There were only 39 trade stories during this period.
<P>
There was also a large difference in the tone of the stories. During
the 1991-1992 study period, many stories focused on how trade,
especially with Japan, was harming America. Trade was like war.
According to NBC's Garrick Utley, on the January 12, 1992 Nightly
News, there is a &quot;new superpower rivalry. We, of course,
won the old one with the Soviet Union. The outcome of the new
one with Japan is much less certain.&quot; Stories focused on
union demands for tariffs and the views of protectionist economists.
<P>
Reporters adopted a different attitude during the 1995-1996 study period.
Spurred by Pat Buchanan's criticism of free trade, the networks
began pointing out the benefits of a global economy. Before the
South Carolina primary, NBC's Mike Boettcher contrasted the &quot;new
South, flush with foreign investment and hightech jobs&quot; with
&quot;the old South, shuttered textile mills, unemployment, and
pleas for protection from foreign competitors.&quot; ABC's Aaron
Brown reported that &quot;while Buchanan says you can protect
industries with high tariffs without driving out foreign companies
here, economists say that is nonsense.&quot;
<P>
There was also a dramatic change in the amount of coverage given to the trade deficit. In
a 1988 study for the Media Institute, Virginia Commonwealth University's
Ted J. Smith III found that as the American economy improved during
the 1980s, reporting on the economy decreased in volume and became
more negative in tone. In particular, he found that the media
became more interested in one statistic  the trade deficit  when
it widened and less interested in other indicators as they improved.
<P>
The trend in trade reporting that Professor Smith found during the
1980s was present during the 1991-1992 study period, when the U.S.
economy was coming out of recession. There were 21 reports about
the trade deficit, about the same number he found when the economy
was coming out of recession from 1982-1983. But during the 1995-1996
study period, when the economy was fully out of recession and
the trade deficit was expanding, there were only eight such reports.
During the Reagan era, when the economy was fully out of recession,
trade deficit reporting increased dramatically.
<P>
During 1991-1992, even decreases in the trade deficit were treated skeptically.
&quot;Some mixed signs on the U.S. economy today,&quot; reported
ABC's Forest Sawyer, on the March 19, 1992 World News Tonight.
&quot;The U.S. trade deficit grew smaller in January, down $5.8
billion. Still, many economists say they are concerned that American
exports were also down.&quot; 
<P>
Trade deficits, though, have not been big news more recently. In two instances, only CBS mentioned reports of widening trade gaps. On July 18, 1995, Dan Rather announced:
&quot;The United States has taken another beating in world trade,
posting a recordhigh deficit in May.&quot; Nearly two months later,
on September 12, 1995, Rather used almost identical language:
&quot;The U.S. took a beating in the world markets for the second
quarter of the year, posting the biggest quarterly trade deficit
ever.&quot; ABC and NBC ignored the news.
<P>
Trade deficits may not be such bad news. Many economists point out that prosperous countries often run trade deficits because they have a lot of money to spend,
and that imports constitute a great benefit to an economy. So
perhaps ABC and NBC were correct to play down the trade numbers.
Still, this was a new standard not applied to GOP presidents.
<P>
And trade in general could be a bigger news issue in this election
year than it has been. Will Bill Clinton, if reelected, again
defy union backers and work to expand the North American Free
Trade Agreement? Reporters, who seem to have lost interest in
trade, aren't asking.

<center><h2>New Business Show Better Than Most</h2>
</center>
<p>
This is the battleground of the modern world, where war is waged daily. Fortunes are made
or lost in seconds. These are the men and women of Gardner/Ross.
They're brilliant, ruthless, only as good as their next deal...They
work hard and play harder and agree on just one thing  winning
is everything.&quot;
<p>
From this promo for Traders, a Canadian program
now being shown on cable's Lifetime network, one would think that
it would be another typical TV caricature of business: A world
dominated by rogue greedheads who have no redeeming qualities
and whose work does nothing beneficial for society.
<p>
While this
tendency is present in the show, it doesn't always dominate. Traders
instead treats investment banking the way television usually treats
some other vocations, which is a step above the way business is
normally portrayed. Traders focuses on the Torontobased investment
firm Gardner/Ross. The plots center on the firm's senior executives:
<p>
<blockquote>
Sally Ross -- An idealistic economics professor, Ross steps into her father's
role as senior partner when he is arrested for illegally skimming
$5 million off of a $47 million deal. She is immediately at odds
with the firm's other senior executives, who want to make money
at all costs. She wants to make money, but also wants to preserve
her family firm's good name. When she doesn't allow the firm's
head trader to trade on inside information, he yells: &quot;You
know, you've got a really unhealthy sense of morality.&quot;
<p>
Adam Cunningham -- Ross's alter ego, Cunningham is willing to blackmail
government officials to land a deal. He has no conscience, but
a great knack for cliches: Investment banking is a &quot;zerosum
game. Nobody wins unless somebody loses&quot; and &quot;We all
know the game. You buy on rumor, you sell on fact. Look, if enough
people believe that fertilizer is worth more than gold, the next
thing you know crap is selling at $600 an ounce.&quot; When the
Russian mob threatens the family of the editor of the firm's newsletter,
Cunningham worries that the editor will care more about her family
than the firm.
<p>
Jack Larkin -- A very hungry young trader, he makes
his way to Gardner/Ross by landing a seatofthepants mining deal.
He's willing to risk everything for a big deal, but he's no Cunningham.
He cares deeply about mending his poor relationship with his father,
and his father's illness occupies as much of his time as does
the firm's business. It also gives him some perspective. When
a young trader almost ruins her career by not placing an order
out of concern for a client who is a compulsive gambler, Larkin
tells her: &quot;I'll deny I ever said this, but it's just a job;
it's just money.&quot; By steering the firm into investing in
an emerging medical drug, Larkin shows viewers that investment
banking can help society.
<p>
Marty Stephens -- The firm's head trader,
Stephens is a younger Cunningham. When the firm's building catches
fire, he threatens to fire any trader who leaves the floor. Is
extensive flooding in South Africa bad news? Not for Stephens,
because the firm will make money from the flood's effect on the
markets. His family life is a mess: He doesn't know the name of
his son's girlfriend, even though she eats dinner with the family
every week. When Stephens is suspended for 30 days because of
unethical trades, his life seems to change. He finds a support
group and learns that he is obsessed with money to compensate
for his own insecurities. He resolves to change his ways, but
once he's back on the floor the old Marty returns.
<p>
Suzanna Marks -- Marks runs the firm's investment newsletter. She becomes the
target of the Russian mob, which wants her to recommend a stock
she doesn't want to recommend. She stands on principle, refusing
to compromise her integrity. The Russians then threaten her family,
including her young daughter. Though terribly tempted, she still
doesn't cave. The situation is resolved when Larkin, whom viewers
learn has some mysterious tie to the Russian mob, finds out about
the threats and intervenes. The stress, though, ruins her family
life. Her husband, believing she places too great a priority on
work, files for divorce and custody of their daughter. 
<p>
Traders has often been compared to ER, but it is more like L.A. Law. On
ER, there is no question that the doctors are engaged in noble
work. On L.A. Law, sometimes the lawyers helped people and society;
sometimes they harmed people and society. Some of L.A. Law's lawyers
were extremely unethical, some morally upright. Traders' traders
are a similar mix. For business, as portrayed on television, this
is a step up in the world.

<center><h2>Media
Tweak Tax Facts</h2>
</center>
<p>
Many journalists swarmed like hornets after the
first presidential debate, their stingers aimed at a Bob Dole
soundbite statistic. Maybe the numbers seemed implausible to them.
Maybe they deemed Dole's private source for the statistic less
reliable than comparable government sources. Or, just maybe, they
were simply expressing their kneejerk bias against conservative
economic principles.
<p>
Whatever the reason, the day after the first
debate, several media outlets challenged Dole's Tax Foundation inspired
statement  that the average American household today pays more
in taxes than it does for food, clothing, and housing combined.
<p>
In a frontpage story, for example, the Los Angeles Times hinted at
a Dole blunder. The article related that while Dole relied on
a conservative think tank for his data, &quot;the Bureau of Labor
Statistics' consumer expenditure survey found that the average
household spent more than twice as much on food, clothing and
shelter as on taxes in 1994.&quot; Eric Engberg of CBS News was
more forthright in his analysis. Asserting that &quot;some [of
Dole's] facts got mangled,&quot; Engberg stated the GOP nominee's
claim was an &quot;exaggeration&quot; that could be disproved
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) study.
<p>
Ironically, while these and other news organizations used the opportunity to show
how Dole, in the words of the Times, was &quot;tweaking&quot;
the truth to his advantage, it appears the media were doing the
same thing. By accepting the BLS data as unimpeachable, the reporters
made an error of such magnitude that, if committed by either of
the presidential candidates, it would have made frontpage news
nationwide.
<p>
The problem is the BLS survey greatly understates taxes
paid. While the national survey is considered an accurate portrayal
of consumer expenditures, in the tax category the report only
covers individual income taxes (federal, state, and local), real
and personal property taxes, and an amorphous category called
&quot;other taxes.&quot;
<p>
Among the most recognizable omissions
from the survey: Social Security taxes paid. While the BLS survey
doesn't have a category for such payments, the Tax Foundation
estimates that the average household will pay about $1,100 for
the employee's share of payroll taxes alone this year. Similarly,
the BLS survey doesn't specifically report sales and excise taxes
paid. In the only entry in the survey in which these taxes might
fit (&quot;other taxes&quot;), households earning between $50,000
and $69,000 are said to pay $77 annually. By comparison, based
on Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) data, the Tax Foundation
estimates that households in that income group average over $2,000
in federal, state, and local sales and excise taxes paid.
<p>
Also,
the BLS survey results altogether ignore the effect of indirect
levies, such as business taxes, on American society. Unlike the
survey, the Tax Foundation incorporates all taxes at all levels
of government in its annual analysis, including those levies hidden
from taxpayers. For example, business taxes (including corporate
income taxes) must be borne by the general population somehow,
whether through lower wages for workers, lower shareholder dividends
(which harms anyone with a pension fund), or higher consumer prices.
So, while the typical American won't ever see a tax bill for these
taxes, they're certainly paid by everyone.
<p>
In total, the BLS survey
 relied on by so many reporters to knock Bob Dole's argument for
lower taxes  understates total taxes paid by more than four times,
according to the Tax Foundation's analysis based on BEA data.
<p>
The
flaw here isn't the BLS survey. It lies in the way the survey's
results were used by reporters. The search for truth by the media
is undeniably critical, especially during an election year. Unfortunately,
the public is hurt when reporters, to prove a point, choose to
accept certain economic premises without verifying their legitimacy.

<title>Reporters Ignore Education Inflation</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Reporters Ignore Education Inflation</center></h2>
<p>
With Congress trying to scale back the Clinton Administration's direct lending program for college students, the media have focused on partisan bickering over the issue. This has obscured the larger question: Why are tuitions rising so fast in the first place?
<p>
On the September 10 World News Tonight ABC's Michele Norris said, "The battle over federal funding for education is turning into an all-out political war. Republican lawmakers are proposing deep cuts in education. President Clinton has said that one of his top priorities is not only maintaining but increasing education spending, particularly for needy college students."
<p>
This politics-centered coverage continued with Rita Braver's report on the September 11 CBS Evening News: "President Clinton took his education crusade to Southern Illinois....He told college students that Republicans in Congress are trying to cut their financial assistance." Braver's story, like Norris's, was relatively balanced; Braver noted "Republicans suggest the President is perpetrating a big lie on campus, engaging in scare tactics to make families believe that student aid is in jeopardy." 
<p>
But neither report took the opportunity to discuss why college costs have risen and how growing federal education spending may be the culprit. Heritage Foundation scholar John Hood points this out in the May issue of Reason: "College administrators, waxing sympathetic, beg for more aid from Congress and state legislatures. Interestingly, those same administrators, along with policy makers and the media, rarely try to explain why college costs are rising." 
<p>
Hood points out that average tuitions rose by a third between 1984 and 1994 because "governments, both federal and state, subsidize colleges and universities -- even private ones -- so heavily that tuition and fees have only the murkiest relationship to the costs of providing higher education."
<p>
Hood shows that the recent rise in federal spending on higher education closely corresponds with the hike in tuition: "During the 1970s, the real-dollar value of government assistance to higher education, adjusted for the number of full-time students, fell slightly. So did real tuition, room, and board charges for both public and private colleges."
<p>
"Throughout the 1980s, however, government assistance per full-time student rose significantly (10 percent, not including loans), accompanied by a 27 percent real rise in public college charges and a staggering 50 percent real rise in private college charges. College and University revenue from Pell Grants rose by more than 25 percent from 1985-86 to 1991-92; revenue from state-level need-based grants rose by about 15 percent."
<p>
If prices in private industry ever rose so fast, reporters would be quick to ask why. They should hold educators to the same standard.

<title>Easy on the Earned Income Tax Credit</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Easy on the Earned Income Tax Credit</h2><center>

The October 2 Newsweek hailed the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) as a boon to 
the working poor and called Congressional efforts to cut the program "the war 
on work." But Newsweek didn't tell readers about evidence that the EITC 
actually discourages work by creating a huge marginal tax rate on the poor.
<p>
According to Newsweek's Marc Levinson, the program, which provides a tax credit 
to low-income workers and cash to those who don't pay taxes, "hits the 
bulls-eye, aiding families who earn too much for welfare but too little to have 
a tax-favored mortgage." Levinson quoted EITC beneficiary Janene Moore as 
saying: "My kids are not welfare statistics....They can say that their momma 
gets a check all right, but it's from her job, seven hours a day, 35 hours a 
week." Levinson also argued that the EITC "does nothing to discourage marriage" 
and cited fraud as the only argument against cutting the credit.
<p>
But what if the EITC actually discourages work? According to the September 20 
Investor's Business Daily (IBD), "Most economists agree that today it's doing 
more harm than good." According to IBD: "Once the family reaches that limit 
[$11,600], the credit is phased out. For each dollar over $11,600, the family 
loses 21 cents of its EITC until its income hits $28,000. Economists say this 
acts like a marginal tax rate of 21 percent," which "provides a strong 
disincentive to work."
<p>
IBD also cited American Enterprise Institute economist Marvin Kosters who 
points out that even having an EITC may discourage work. "After all, 
[recipients] get a 40 percent raise without working any harder." Kosters also 
claims that the EITC does indeed exact a marriage penalty, in some cases as 
much as $5,000 per couple. According to Kosters, That "would be about 25 
percent of the combined income of the married couple."
<p>
It's not enough for reporters to cite fraud as an argument against the EITC. 
Economists have serious concerns about the program's disincentives to work, 
concerns which must be addressed in a balanced story.

<title>Inequality Study Left Unchallenged by MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>

<center><h2>Inequality Study Left Unchallenged by MacNeil-Lehrer 
NewsHour</center></h2>
Something unusual happened on September 28. The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour, 
normally well known for balanced and fair coverage, gave a one-sided account of 
an important issue. David Gergen, now returned from his role as White House 
adviser, conducted a softball interview of economist Edward Wolff about wealth 
inequality which ignored many flaws in Wolff's analysis.
<p>
Gergen didn't challenge Wolff, author of a recent study on the subject for the 
20th Century Fund, when he claimed that "income of the average family has been 
basically stagnant for the last fifteen, twenty years, and has actually started 
to decline during the 1990s." Wolff said he saw "nothing that suggests that 
these forces are going to abate." Moreover, he blamed the stock market as 
"another factor which has caused wealth and inequality to rise."
<p>
Gergen could have asked Wolff to respond to critics of his study. Christopher 
Farrell reports in the October 9 Business Week what many economists have long 
maintained: "The consumer price index has been overstating inflation by at 
least a percentage point. If that's the case, then real wage gains are 0.8 
percent a year," rather than the 0.2 percent decline reported by government 
statistics. Farrell also reports that "the skill level of American labor is 
improving, with more workers getting the education and training employers 
require" and that in the past, that has produced more equal income 
distribution.
<p>
The August 22 Investor's Business Daily (IBD), meanwhile, points out a major 
flaw in Wolff's study. "Pensions account for about one-third of the average 
household's assets," the newspaper reports, and are "the way most Americans are 
invested in the stock market." But Wolff's study, according to IBD, excludes 
the value of pension plans. (See page 5.)
<p>
Instead of pushing his guest to answer these criticisms, Gergen asked softball 
questions like, "I take it from the tenor of your remarks, as well as your 
study, that you think this growing inequality as you found it is dangerous 
socially for the country?" Viewers have come to expect more from the 
MacNeil/Lehrer News-Hour.

<title>Missing Japan's Revolutionary Debate</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>

<center><h2>Missing Japan's Revolutionary Debate</h2></center>

Network news coverage of Japan has changed recently. When Japan seemed 
invincible, network journalists would often report on Japanese industrial 
policy with the underlying premise that it made Japanese capitalism superior to 
American capitalism. Now, with Japan's economy in a prolonged tailspin, the 
networks have dropped the subject, no longer showing any interest in the 
economic effects of Japanese industrial policy.
<p>
Ned Potter's December 15, 1992 ode to Japan's government planners for ABC's 
World News Tonight was typical of a pre-1995 network story on Japan. Potter 
told viewers that environmental protection would be the biggest new industry of 
the future. He said that while the U.S. was leading the world in environmental 
cleanup technology, "Japan is mounting a major offensive to be the new leaders 
in what they call the eco-industrial revolution."
<p>
Potter glowingly described "Genesis," the Japanese plan to direct companies to 
work on such projects as technology for clean coal and oil plants. The moral of 
Potter's story: Genesis "shows how far ahead the Japanese are looking. And 
that's the challenge for America. With the new Administration seeking an 
economic revival, how can it best help U.S. industry compete with Japan for the 
environmental marketplace?"
<p>
That was 1992. Reporters, understandably, no longer use Japan as a model of 
government economic planning. But they also aren't talking about Japanese 
industrial policy at all anymore, even though in Japan, the role of government 
is the subject of fierce debate. U.S. News & World Report's Stephen Butler 
relates that "a fast-selling, controversial new book that has unleashed a 
torrent of debate in Tokyo suggests Japan must do more than throw money at its 
problems."
<p>
According to Butler, Japanese author Yukio Noguchi argues that Japan's economic 
woes "are a painful legacy of World War II, when the government intervened 
heavily in the private economy and suppressed market forces to boost industrial 
output." But despite this "torrent of debate" about Noguchi's book, no network 
report from Japan has mentioned Noguchi or his free market arguments.
Network reporters should be more curious about the roots of Japan's four-year 
economic stagnation. If they are, they will find and report on a robust debate 
in Japan about the role of government in a free economy.

<title>Editor's Note, by Burton Yale Pines</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff">

<center><h2>Editor's Note, by Burton Yale Pines</h2></center>
<center><h3>Post: Low Pay Not a Dead End </h3></center>

A nation of hamburger flippers in dead-end jobs.
<p>
That's almost always the dire outcome predicted by journalists when they cover 
America's fast-food industry. Such reporting, intended or not, tends to confirm 
and bolster the calls by politicians and academics for ambitious federal 
job-training programs and other measures that they claim are needed to lift 
unskilled Americans out of the minimum-wage trough.
<p>
Such reporting, sadly, misses one of America's major economics and business 
stories: The fast-food industry as the nation's most effective job-training 
program. 
<p>
One reporter, however, obviously has not missed the story. He's the Washington 
Post's Peter Behr who, in a September 11 page one article, profiles Le-Van 
Hawkins, a 35-year-old African-American Horatio Alger who now owns a $39 
million-a year business and who got his start where? At hamburger-flipping 
McDonald's. Throughout his perceptive report, Behr uses Hawkins' own successes 
to make the valid but almost always ignored point that fast-food jobs can be a 
great career beginning rather than a dead end.
<p> 
Behr explains how Hawkins, a high school dropout who had "a serious cocaine 
habit" and grew up in Chicago's notorious Cabrini Green housing project, was 
taught discipline and skills by his fast-food employers. At his first 
McDonald's job, writes Behr, Hawkins "became a walking encyclopedia on 
McDonald's procedures for dealing with burgers, pickles and fries. The lesson 
of getting the details right struck." These lessons were reinforced by 
subsequent jobs at Kentucky Fried Chicken and other fast-food outlets.
<p>
Citing an executive with Hawkins' firm, Behr tells his readers that there is "a 
career ladder inside the fast-food world, even if the bottom rungs don't reach 
very high. Workers who start out preparing food can advance to production 
leader, hourly shift manager and assistant manager." Some of the Hawkins' store 
managers, reports Behr, "earn up to $50,000 annually and will have the option 
to buy stock in the company."
<p>
Behr too notes the broader economic implications of the fast-food industry. He 
writes: "Fast-food franchises have long been islands of commerce in the often 
depressed sections of major cities." These typically inner-city franchises, 
says Behr, then "provide business for attorneys, accountants and suppliers in 
the community."
<p>
Behr's report is a needed antidote to journalists' prevailing low-view of 
low-paying jobs. Characteristic of this is Time's John Greenwald in the 
magazine's November 14, 1994 edition. Writing about high-salaried computer 
jobs, Greenwald remarked that they "bear little resemblance to the low-paying 
gas-pumping and fast food-making positions that the word 'services' has often 
brought to mind." This echoed Beth Belton's USA Today article of February 15, 
1994, talking about "low-paying jobs with few opportunities for advancement." 
TV viewers, meanwhile, would have heard ABC's Bob Jamieson, on the March 15, 
1994 World News Tonight, refer derisively to what he called "the low-paying 
service sector."
<p>
These and other journalists should study closely Behr's article. They then 
should investigate how poorly-educated Americans actually can learn job skills 
and work discipline. Their resulting articles could address the questions: What 
trains more workers -- government programs or fast food employers? Who does a 
better job of training? How long do most fast-food workers actually remain at 
the lowest-paying level? Such articles, at last, would begin educating the 
public that hamburger-flipping seldom is a dead-end job.

<title>&quot;MEDIA REALITY CHECK '96&quot;</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<center><img src="/mrc/images/checkbox.gif" <br>
<p></center>

A WORD FROM L. BRENT BOZELL III<br>
CHAIRMAN, MEDIA RESEARCH CENTER<br>
JUNE 1996<p>

CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg said it best: &quot;The old argument that the networks and other 'media elites' have a liberal bias is so blatantly true it's hardly worth discussing any more.&quot; From Walter Cronkite to Newsweek Washington Bureau Chief Evan Thomas, more and more media personalities are admitting the liberal bias they denied for so long, while ridiculing conservatives who raised that charge. 
<p>
The recent Freedom Forum poll of Washington reporters and editors found 89 percent of them voted for Bill Clinton in 1992, to only seven percent for Bush; 61 percent identified themselves as liberal or moderate-to-liberal, to only nine percent who were conservative or moderate-to conservative; 59 percent called the Contract with America &quot;an election-year campaign ploy,&quot; to only three percent who thought it was
&quot;a serious policy proposal.&quot; 
<p>
And their coverage of public policy and politics reflected these views. We are not here today to prove a blatantly obvious anti-conservative bias in the press. We have proven that for almost a decade. We are here to demand an end to the non-stop media onslaught against the conservative movement -- against our ideas, our character, and our leaders. We are here to demand the media be fair and balanced -- for once. 
<p>
To this end, I announce &quot;Media Reality Check '96,&quot; a 2.8 million dollar campaign by the Media Research Center to expose for the American electorate the
blatant left-wing agenda that has made a mockery of the term &quot;objective journalism.&quot; The message from the conservative movement, like the line from the movie &quot;Network,&quot; is loud and clear: &quot;We're mad as hell and we're not going to take it any more.&quot; 
<p>
&quot;Media Reality Check '96&quot; will combine the most sophisticated media research operation with the most advanced technology to produce what we believe the most comprehensive and creative national campaign ever waged to confront, expose, and neutralize the liberal bias that dominates the news media today. 
<p>
Knowing how so many establishment media outlets feel it is their right to examine everything and everyone under the sun, while refusing to allow any criticism of themselves, this year we are bypassing the establishment media and going straight to the voters through the fledgling conservative media. And based on the test-marketing of this campaign over the past month, I can confidently state that our message will reach,
on average, at least 50,000 conservative activists and 25 million voters every week. As well, all of our findings will be made available to thousands of journalists on a regular basis to let them know their days of journalistic political activism are over.
<p>
&quot;Media Reality Check '96&quot; will have nine major components: <br>
<ol>
<li>Research. The basis of all our products is research by our eight-member media analysis team, who are taping and analyzing every single network newscast, national
newspaper and news magazine to document trends of liberal bias. Our comprehensive network news tracking system will not only document bias in 1996, but show, with scientific data, just how this follows the pro-Clinton, anti-conservative coverage in 1992.

<li>Publications. All of the MRC's monthly and bi-weekly publications -- MediaWatch, MediaNomics, Notable Quotables, and Flash -- will focus almost exclusively on the issues and trends of campaign '96 for thousands of reporters, subscribers, and activists.

<li>Pattern of Deception. MRC Senior Analyst Tim Graham's new book documents the astonishing bias Bill Clinton has benefited from in the last four years and sets the stage for a national discussion of the media's obvious preference for this President. In less than six weeks, he has conducted interviews or had his blockbuster book cited on over 50 radio shows, from local shows to nationally syndicated programs like the G. Gordon
Liddy show, the Ollie North show, and Rush Limbaugh. 

<li>Talk Radio. Over the past several months we have established an informal network of over 100 radio talk shows -- including every major nationally-syndicated show -- to provide them with up-to-the-minute evidence of left-wing bias in the establishment press masquerading as &quot;objective news.&quot; As well, MRC spokesmen are now conducting daily interviews on numerous shows coast to coast to expose the liberal media.

<li>The Internet. Using the Internet, the MRC will be communicating with hundreds of thousands of conservative activists while providing immediate intelligence to the conservative media. The MRC website will be up and running on June 24 for public
and media use during the 1996 campaign, with a full slate of studies, profiles, and special reports. MRC Executive Director Brent Baker is providing &quot;Reality Check Cyber Alerts&quot; through e-mail to the nation's most influential opinion leaders three to five
nights a week for a rapid response to media bias.

<li>Media Outreach. Two-page &quot;Media Reality Check '96&quot; rebuttals are being sent via &quot;blast fax&quot; to over 1500 media and political contacts across the country on a regular basis. In addition, bias during major campaign events -- such as the upcoming conventions -- will be addressed with news releases and news conferences throughout the year.

<li>Conventions. Once again this year, the MRC will publish a daily newsletter during the two party conventions to document the ongoing political slant in prime-time convention
coverage. This year, the MRC is also considering a daily national radio feed to provide evidence of reporters' biased coverage. This daily commentary will reach tens of millions of voters.

<li>Conservative Grass-Roots Activism. To make the so-called objective national media an issue in this campaign, the MRC is mass-producing thousands of bumper stickers,
pens, refrigerator magnets and other novelty items with the tag line &quot;I Don't Believe the Liberal News Media.&quot; The national distribution efforts are already under way. MRC members -- 75,000 nationwide -- will also participate through letter-writing  campaigns and other efforts to expose and confront liberal bias at the local level.

<li>Paid Advertising. The MRC will be advancing its efforts through a paid advertising campaign. Conservative newspapers, magazines, and radio talk shows will be the vehicle of choice for our paid advertising efforts; again, based on the test-marketing of this communications strategy, we are confident it will have a huge impact.
</ol>
Will the national media try again to tilt the election in favor of Bill Clinton? Will they try again consistently to label the Republicans as &quot;extremists&quot; -- or worse -- and the Democrats as moderates, even conservatives?<br>
Will they regularly denounce Republican ads as &quot;wrong&quot; when they were proven right, while ignoring Clinton ads altogether?<br>
Will they try again to single out the Republicans as mudslinging campaigners while presenting the Democrats as a hopeful force for positive change? If so, the MRC will be there to show America just how distorted the message really is. 
<p>
By no means do we suggest that all reporters in the national press are culpable. Many have distinguished themselves, and continue to distinguish themselves with their dedication to balance and fairness. And that's all we conservative ask. But this year we demand it.

<img src="/mrc/images/pattern.gif" align="right">The explosive new book <i><b>Pattern of Deception</b></i> assembles a mountain of evidence proving how the liberal media, especially the television networks, have promoted the Clinton agenda, both during his campaign and his presidency.<p>

You'll learn:

<ul>
<li> Which TV producer bragged about setting up Clinton's campaign public relations while working for ABC.

<li> How the media campaigned to discredit Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, and Troopergate.

<li> How Clinton lied about being drafted -- and how the networks virtually spiked it.

<li> Which <i>Time</i> editor misled readers about Clinton being drafted -- and eventually landed the # 2 job in the State Department.

<li> Which <i>Washington Post</i> reporter compared Clinton to Jesus Christ.
</ul>

"In <i><b>Pattern of Deception</b></i>, you'll read how the press have given the Clinton administration a free ride on policy issues which are far more important to the future of liberalism than personal peccadilloes."<br>
-- Cal Thomas<p>

"The liberal media have the power to set the national agenda, and <i><b>Pattern of Deception</b></i> proves that this is just what they're doing."<br>
-- L. Brent Bozell III<p>

"Must reading for the GOP."<br>
-- Arianna Huffington<p>

<h2><center>Quote of the Day</h2><p>
  
    <i>"I think there were some transcendent moments but some risky
rhetorical gambles here, where Bob Dole may have taken the
risk of coming across more as the preachy grandfather than
the grown-up he most wants to be, and that could turn off
some voters." <p>

-- ABC s Michel McQueen just after Dole's
acceptance speech last night.<p></i>
  
<h2><a name="speech">Dole's Speech</a> Performance Praised by Most, But... 
ABC: Dole s "A Preachy Grandfather"</h2></center>
  
    Bob Dole speech coverage featured praise for his delivery,
but the networks were critical of its content. <p>
  
    -- ABC condemned it as "preachy," and NBC called it "tough."
Just after Dole finished, ABC's Michel McQueen warned that he
may have come across as a "preachy grandfather" [see Quote of
the Day below]. Sam Donaldson called it "a red meat speech"
and a "a very tough speech, I mean, Bob Dole says that
violent criminals will have their lives made a living Hell,
he'd pursue terrorists to the ends of the Earth, I think he s
going to dash the teachers  unions into the sea." NBC's Lisa
Myers described it as "the best speech I ever saw Bob Dole
give," but colleague David Bloom said "this was a very tough
speech, Bob Dole calling himself combative for country, but
the people down here, the partisans loved it."<p>
  
    -- CNN went to Wolf Blitzer for a Democratic response just
four minutes after Dole finished. Gene Randall then demanded
Dole campaign manager Scott Reed respond to that spin: "Let
me just run by first what George Stephanopoulos said about
the speech. Even before it was over he called it, 'The most
negative, partisan, divisive acceptance speech since
Goldwater in 1964.'"<p>
  
    -- In Dole's speech CNN's Bernard Shaw discovered the
beginning of a nasty campaign: "I ve maintained that this
campaign is going to be one of the nastiest, bare-knuckled,
direct to the gut campaign's in America s political history.
Listen to this one sentence, quote 'It is demeaning to the
nation that within the Clinton administration a core of the
elite never grew up, never did anything real, never
sacrificed, never suffered and never learned, should have the
power to fund with your earnings their dubious and self-serving
schemes.'"<p>  
    -- One day after Ted Koppel left San Diego, Nightline covers
the convention, talking with a focus group; reporters discuss
GOP inclusiveness.<p>
  
    -- A Video Contrast: In 1992 ABC and CBS ran bios of Clinton;
but nothing for Dole this year. NBC ran part of Clinton's
video, but none of Dole's. <p>
  

<h2><center><a name="diversity">So Much for Network Bio Diversity
The Man from Hope vs. Russell's Own</a></h2></center><p>

    Four years ago at the Democratic convention in New York, ABC's 
Peter Jennings explained the quandary biographical films present
to the networks. "I'm not precisely sure what to call it," 
Jennings said, "but it's the Democratic Party's film 
about Bill Clinton's life, and it's something we try to 
come to grips with every four years when the party decides what
its view of the candidates is." ABC's 1992 resolution: "We 
think it's usually more prudent to give the assignment to a
reporter." Reporter Jeff Greenfield then introduced viewers to
Bill Clinton's life story.<p>

    CBS did the same. Dan Rather told viewers: "The delegates are 
now watching a film about Bill Clinton, prepared by the Clinton
campaign. We asked correspondent Richard Threlkeld to look at the
film and report on it." NBC aired the final three minutes of the
"Man from Hope" film. This year, CBS only showed the last 30
seconds of the Republicans biographical film for Dole and didn't
assign the story to a reporter. NBC aired nothing. ABC skipped
the film so it could check in with Brit Hume with President
Clinton in Wyoming, with the vital news that Clinton claimed he
wasn't watching the convention.<p>

    Bob Dole's life story would still be news to many Americans. 
<i>U.S. News & World Report's</i> Gloria Borger noted in the 
June 3 issue that "A Harris poll last month found that 59 percent
of Americans don't know Dole has a disibility." They must watch
too much television news.<p>


<h2><center><a name="CBS">Paula Zahn Insists CBS Coverage Has "Been Abundantly Fair"
But CBS Impugned GOP as "Extremist"</a></h2></center><p>
  
    Wednesday night Marc Morano, best known as the Rush Limbaugh
TV show's "man in Washington," confronted several network
reporters with his camera and microphone. Asked about liberal
bias, CBS correspondent Paula Zahn responded:<p>
  
    "Those of us who work for organizations like CBS News take
great pride in being fair and I think if you look at this
Republican convention, our coverage, you ll agree that we
have been abundantly fair." Well, Morano asked, what about
the use of extremist labels? "I don t think I ve used the
word extremist once since I got here on Saturday," the former
CBS This Morning co-host insisted. "Obviously, labels, I
think are very limiting and we have to be very careful about
how we use that."<p>
  
    She may be able to restrain herself, but her colleagues are
not so professional. On Monday's CBS Evening News Dan
Rather asked Jack Kemp: "Even some Republicans describe the
current platform as quote, 'harsh, extreme,' even 'radical.' 
Do you see it that way?"  <p>
  
    Lesley Stahl, later that night in prime time, claimed: "The
whole purpose of tonight's convention, the whole program, is
to diminish the image of this party as extreme, because
that's what's turning the women off. Four years ago, the main
speaker at the convention...was Pat Buchanan. He was yelling,
his pitchforks were raised. Tonight it will be Colin Powell,
he will appeal to civility. On the platform, women find that
extreme. It's turning them off." <p>
  
    But Zahn is far from innocent. Take a look at a question that
she posed on the July 5, 1995 CBS This Morning to Pat
Buchanan: "Even your sister concedes, although some
supporters might like what you have to say about the economy
and these very specific issues you just mentioned, they re
very turned off by some of your social policies. And you know
you ve got political enemies out there calling you an
isolationist, a bigot, you re anti-gay, and some even go as
far as saying that your social stands are reminiscent of Nazi
Germany. How are you to win them over?"<p>


<center><h2><a name="week">What TV Showed: Extremist, Intolerant & Strident Republicans
The Distorted Week in Review<a/></center><p></h2>
  
    So what have viewers across America heard about the
Republican convention? At week s end, here s a collection of
the most biased quotes from the networks:<p>
  
    -- "He [Kemp] is a rare combination 'a nice conservative.
These days conservatives are supposed to be mean. They're
supposed to be haters.'" <p>
<i>-- CNN analyst Bill Schneider, August
9 Inside Politics.</i><p>
  
    -- "Ronald Reagan will still have to learn how history will
judge his time in office -- the deficits, the Iran-Contra
affair. But for the members of this party, there is no more
beloved figure." <p>

<i>-- Tom Brokaw just after Nancy Reagan's
emotional thank-you following a video tribute to Ronald
Reagan, August 12 NBC convention coverage.<p></i>
  
    -- "You know a lot has been made of the Republican Party
being a very inclusive party, one that can embrace the views
of various people. Given the way the platform has worked out
vis-a-vis abortion, and the fact that some of these
Republican governors are not speaking because they felt as if
they were being censored. Do you still believe you can call
the Republican Party an inclusive party?" <p>
<i>-- One of seven
abortion questions posed by NBC's Katie Couric to Senator Kay
Bailey Hutchison, August 12 Today.</i><p>
  
   -- "Women have not responded well to a message that at times
has been considered too harsh, too mean." <p>
<i>-- ABC's Michel
McQueen, during August 13 coverage.<p></i>
  
    -- "It was grand TV, well-scripted, well-staged, craftily
designed for a broadcast image of tolerance and diversity
that's starkly at odds with reality." <p>
<i>-- ABC's Jim Wooten on
Colin Powell s address, August 13 World News Tonight.</i><p>
  
    -- "The right to abortion has never been an overwhelming
issue for women at election time. But this fight within the
Republican Party has many women questioning how far this
party will go to limit their rights."  <p>
<i>-- ABC s Peter Jennings,
August 13.</i><p>
  
    -- "Although his speech was generally well-received, the
reception was restrained, and there were boos whenever Powell
steered away from the right. Though they booed and also
heckled dissent, Republicans claimed the mantle of inclusion
throughout the first night of their convention. We can expect
more of the same today, Tuesday, August 13, 1996." -- <p>
<i>Today
co-host Bryant Gumbel.</i><p>
  
    -- "Do you think -- this is a party that is dominated by men
and this convention is dominated by men as well...Do you
think before tonight they thought very much what happens in
America with rape?" <p>
<i>-- Tom Brokaw to rape victim Jan Licence
who had just addressed the convention, August 13.  </i><p>
  
    -- "I think the speech by Senator Hutchison of Texas is
dangerous, Tom, because she uses words that could be
interpreted by some people as mean." <p>
<i>-- NBC's Tim Russert
previewing Hutchison's August 13 speech.</i><p>
  
    -- "Polls will tell you these days that people do not want
much partisanship in their politics, but they got it at the
Republican convention last night. There were attacks on
President Clinton's credibility, integrity, even his eating
habits." <p>
<i>-- ABC Good Morning America co-host Charles Gibson,
August 14. </i><p>
  
    -- "There's an old adage that says what you do speaks so
loudly I can't hear what you say. Republicans are speaking
tolerance and diversity. Are you seeing any evidence of it,
or quite the contrary?" <p>
<i>-- Gumbel to Tim Russert, August 14
Today.</i><p>
  
    -- "Just how tightly scripted is this convention? Well, a
Russian television reporter said today that this is as
tightly controlled as anything the Communist Party ever put
on, Tom." <p>
<i>-- NBC reporter David Bloom, August 14 Nightly News.</i><p>

<h3>Bryant the Killjoy</h3><p>
  
    As the rest of the media conceded the success of Elizabeth
Dole's Wednesday night speech from the floor, Today co-host
Bryant Gumbel grumbled Thursday morning: "Yeah, I guess some
would say it was cool. Others would say it was calculating,
huh?" <p>
  
    Later, Gumbel added: "In keeping with the softer image that
Republicans are trying hard to project at their convention,
Elizabeth Dole last night did her impression of Oprah
Winfrey, and in a fashion that supporters would call
heartfelt but others would call hokey, Liddy Dole sang her
husband s praises to the delegates." <p>
  
  
<h3>Ending With a Bang</h3><p>
  
    ABC's Brian Ross filed stories all week long on the corporate
money lavished on the GOP, but his Thursday World News
Tonight report focused on a surprising target: "Very much in
the middle of the mix are the giant media corporations, like
CNN, whose multi-million-dollar merger has yet to be formally
approved by federal regulators. Time Warner gave more than
$100,000 to be an official sponsor of the convention."<p>
  
    Former <i>Los Angeles Times</i> reporter Dwight Morris told Ross
media companies shouldn t use the conventions to lobby, and
Ross noted: "But that didn t stop CBS lobbyists from giving
the Republicans thousands of dollars to help pay for the cost
of food and liquor in the skybox belonging to Republican
Party Chairman Haley Barbour." <p>
  
    Ross even reported on his own bosses: "Last night, the ABC
hospitality suite was a lobbyist s dream. With visits from
Congressman Tom Bliley, the chairman of the House Commerce
Committee, which handles telecommunications issues. And then
from the #2  man in the House, Majority Leader Dick Armey,
who could be seen with top ABC executives, including the ABC
lobbyist, who insisted he wasn't lobbying." We look forward
to an equally revealing set of nightly reports from Chicago.<p>
  
  
<h3>William's Wimps</h3><p>
  
    <i>Wall Street Journal</i> reporter Bob Davis wrote an article for
the Thursday morning edition on MRC Chairman Brent Bozell and
the Media Reality Check '96 effort in San Diego. Davis found
notable hostility at CNN to Bozell: "His criticism is mostly
background noise,  says CNN political director Tom Hannon."
Davis asked CNN analyst Bill Schneider to explain his claim
last weekend that "conservatives are supposed to be haters"
and Jack Kemp "is a rare combination: a nice conservative."
Said Schneider: "I wasn t name-calling. I was making an
analytical point." He added that he calls liberals wimps, but
"they re so wimpy, they don t complain. When you talk about
mean conservatives, the wrath of God comes down on you."<p>
  
    But a look into the Nexis news data retrieval system finds
something different. Schneider quoted criticism of Colin
Powell s "wimpout" on abortion in 1995. The only other uses
of "wimp" in the last five years were three nearly identical
references in 1992 and 1994 to the 1988 Bush-Dukakis
campaign. Schneider declared on November 1, 1994: "Michael
Dukakis got beaten up by the wimp, which proved he wasn't
tough enough for the job."<p>

<title>On the Bright Side, from the January 1996 MediaWatch</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<h2>On the Bright Side, from the January 1996 MediaWatch</h2>
<p>
<h3>Nightline's True Story</h3>
<p>
ABC News has never been eager to report the truth on GOP efforts to reform Medicare. Good Morning America anchor Morton Dean continually got the story wrong. On October 12 Dean relayed the Democratic line: "The Republican plan would cut $270 billion in Medicare spending over seven years." Exactly two months and scores of inaccurate reports later, ABC finally told the truth with a December 12 Nightline dedicated to exposing President Clinton's demagoguery.
<p>
Chris Bury explained the game, "`Devastate, destroy, dismantle` -- strong words, but in reviewing Mr. Clinton's performance on Medicare, Republicans have another word in mind: deceptive...The truth is, both President Clinton and the Congress want to spend more money, not less, on Medicare."
<p>
Reviewing Hillary Clinton's 1993 appearance before Congress, Bury showed the First Lady's testimony where she proclaimed that her health plan reduced "the rate of growth in Medicare from about 11 percent increase annually to about a 6 or 7 percent increase annually." Then Bury added, "But this year, when Republicans proposed to slow the annual growth of Medicare spending to 7.2 percent...President Clinton accused them of gutting the program."
<p>
Bury concluded his report: "Since August, when President Clinton cast himself in the role of Medicare's protector, his own standing in the polls has risen steadily, and though his performance has been a smashing popular success, many critics believe the price of admission has cost the country an honest debate."
<p>


<h3>A Woman on Welfare</h3>
<p>
When Republicans began to tinker with the welfare system, reporters were quick to point out the millions who would end up in poverty as a result. But on the November 19 60 Minutes, CBS' Lesley Stahl offered a different take when she profiled "a woman who knows as much about the subject as anyone. A woman on welfare? No, a woman on the subject of welfare."
<p>
She was Eloise Anderson, head of California's welfare division. Anderson knows what welfare is like; she was once on it. She  also supports Republican proposals. Stahl noted: "What Anderson wants to get rid of are the cash payments that go directly to welfare recipients, known as AFDC....It seems there's no argument for AFDC that she agrees with. The problem, she says, starts with the way welfare marginalizes men, because no poor man who makes the minimum wage, can compete with it."
<p>
Stahl pointed out: "Her critics have called her everything from mean-spirited to compassionless, but Anderson says it's a question of fairness to low-income workers who pay taxes."  As for fears of disaster, "Anderson says there will be no excuse for not taking a minimum wage job when the cash payments end, because poor people will still get help; with food stamps, medical coverage, and child care."

<center><h2>Janet Cooke Award, from the January 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<p>
<h3>CNN Describes Speaker as "Too Extreme" and "Scary," A "Clown Prince" with "Fits of Pique"<br>
Newt Gingrich, Political Liability?</h3>
<p>
Time selects its Man of the Year not by picking its favorite person, but the person with the most historical impact in that given year. In 1995, certainly, Newt Gingrich had a powerful impact on America's political debate. But that didn't mean Time had to like him -- and neither did CNN in producing a December 17 CNN Presents to announce the pick. For maligning the Speaker as a politically damaged and morally questionable figure after celebrating Time's choice of Bill Clinton in 1992, CNN earned the Janet Cooke Award.
<p>
CNN split its show between interviews with Gingrich and documentary segments. In the first segment, host Judy Woodruff used loaded language to describe Gingrich's "Path to Power," calling his ambition to be Speaker "An obsession that shaped almost every decision, every alliance, what some saw as every betrayal on his path to power." Woodruff relayed a rumor about Gingrich's first wife, Jackie: "It has become part of the Gingrich legend that he would later go to her hospital room where she was being treated for cancer to discuss a divorce." 
<p>
Woodruff described how Gingrich first came to the capital's attention: "In late-night tirades on C-SPAN, he needled then-House Speaker Tip O'Neill, painting ruling Democrats as corrupt thugs." Woodruff called him "a clown prince of an out-of-favor group." She concluded: "His self-ordained mission to save Western civilization is becoming overshadowed by a barrage of accusations that the most powerful Speaker in history illegally used political money." While CNN followed with Rep. David Bonior charging Gingrich's ethics are "in the toilet," Woodruff did not explain any of the charges, most of which were dismissed by the House ethics committee days later.
<p>
Another segment, titled "Homefront," explored Gingrich's hold on his constituency in Georgia: "Cobb County -- the soul of Newt country, Republican, white, well-educated, and affluent. The man who would wield the federal budget ax represents a county that exploded into suburban sprawl because of billions of federal dollars. Unemployment is low here, at 3.4 percent. It's well below the national average. And only a scant five percent of Cobb's population is on public assistance. The social fallout of the Contract with America if it passes will have little consequence here, but those hit will be hit hard."
<p>
CNN talked mostly to social service providers, liberal activists, and projected victims: "For the Hogan family, some cutbacks are the wrong thing to do. Daughter Kimberly, disabled from birth, has spent most of her life in a hospital. Thanks to Medicaid, this year has been different." Protesters held up signs reading "Newt: Your Plan Will Kill Us."
<p>

These documentary segments were heavily salted with Gingrich opponents: "The Path to Power" featured five negative talking heads (including three from Rep. Pat Schroeder and one of Bonior) to only three positive. "Homefront" featured twelve anti-Gingrich soundbites to four defenders. A segment called "Report Card" focusing on his future balanced the talking heads six to six, which included Bonior predicting that Gingrich's ethics problems were "so severe" he wouldn't be in office much longer.
<p>
If that hostility weren't enough, there were Woodruff's interview questions to the Speaker: "There's something we saw that was kind of interesting, the latest CNN-Time poll, they asked people what they thought about you and a lot of people said, most people said, very intelligent. A number of them said he has a vision for the future, but they also said -- a large number of those same people said, and I thought this was interesting, they agreed you were too extreme, 66 percent -- and out of touch, 52 percent, and even scary 49 percent. Where does that come from?"
<p>
When Gingrich suggested that things like being portrayed as Scrooge on the cover of Time didn't help, Woodruff replied: "But there's also been, in addition to that, what many people look at as the effect of the Republican budget cuts, and most of the people -- what they see is that most people, according to the studies we've seen, who would lose under the combined budget cuts and tax changes are the very poorest Americans, and people have a hard time understanding that."
<p>
Gingrich challenged that spin, but Woodruff reacted: "The study I'm referring to came out I think in the last week or so, by the Urban Institute, highly respected group, supposed to be nonpartisan -- and they set aside Medicaid and Medicare, they just looked at the budget cuts separate from Medicare and Medicaid and tax changes, and their conclusion was that the families that would lose under the Republican plan, two-thirds are in the poorest fifth of the population." The Urban Institute has often disseminated research that concludes with the need for more federal social spending.
<p>
Woodruff concluded the program with a decidedly negative spin: "He couldn't have envisioned the blizzard of ethics charges or the stir his fits of pique would cause. Now that they've gotten to know him, more than half of all Americans say they don't like him. More than half say they don't trust him. The irony is that Time's Man of the Year may wind up the biggest liability to the revolution he launched."
<p>
This program was a 180-degree change from the show CNN aired on December 26, 1992, when Bill Clinton was named Time's Man of the Year. The 30-minute show featured at least 18 positive talking heads, including Clintonites Robert Reich, Ron Brown, Dee Dee Myers, and Betsey Wright, Democratic Reps. Tom Foley and Lee Hamilton, Democratic consultant Bob Squier, and black academic Henry Louis Gates. Only one soundbite from conservative Arkansas editorialist Paul Greenberg offered any balance. 
<p>
The narration by CNN's Lou Waters and Natalie Allen said nothing about Clinton's troubled private life, nothing about ethics, nothing about overweening ambition. Allen began the show with a quotation: "He was not born a king, but a child of the common people who made himself a great persuader, therefore, a leader by dint of firm resolve, patient effort, and dogged perseverance." Chimed in Waters: "The words were written by Horace Greeley a century ago to describe Abraham Lincoln. They apply as well to this persevering young man from Arkansas, now leader of the Free World." Allen continued: "The election of 1992 was a leap of faith in a sour and unpredictable year. American voters were angry and disgusted and often afraid of the future. They took an enormous risk and made a fascinating choice." 
<p>
CNN prepared a response to MediaWatch questions, but it did not arrive by press time. It will appear next month. CNN may have contributed to the effect its polls have noticed: viewers were instructed that the Speaker was politically extreme, even scary, while Clinton was Honest Abe.

<center><h2>Newsbites, from the January 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<h3>The Silent Veto.</h3>
Bill Clinton vetoed the welfare reform bill late on January 9, in an apparent attempt to avoid that night's news coverage. His concern was understandable; the veto would be an admission that he was breaking his famous campaign promise to "end welfare as we know it." 
<p>
Clinton worried needlessly: None of the network's January 10 evening news shows mentioned Clinton's veto, even after possible GOP opponent Bob Dole took to the Senate floor to criticize Clinton's betrayal. Although the media properly focused on criticism when George Bush broke his "no new taxes" campaign pledge, there was no focus on criticism of Clinton. The media missed another opportunity when Clinton held a press conference January 11. He was peppered with 18 questions, but not one raised the issue of his breaking his welfare promise, the crux of his effort to portray himself as a "New Democrat." 
<p>

<h3>Flattening Forbes. </h3>
At first glance, Steve Forbes' presidential campaign would seem to fulfill the media's standards for a proper Republican candidate: One with sufficiently soft stands on social issues to avoid the "divisive" label. Unable to attack Forbes as extremist (he has suitably "tolerant" stands on such issues as abortion and immigration), in the December 4 Time, Senior Writer Richard Stengel charged that "for all his patrician good humor, Forbes' message and his campaign have begun to show a hard edge." Stengel exploited a tenuous link between Forbes and Senator Jesse Helms' racially-tinged campaigns: "While Forbes generally shuns the politics of exclusion, he has nonetheless attracted to his organization two veterans of Jesse Helms' race-baiting campaigns." 
<p>
He also attacked Forbes' centerpiece flat tax proposal: "Despite his frequent protestations that he understands the needs of the average Joe, his flat-tax proposal would reward wealthy investors while leaving the burden on middle-class families." He added the plan would "do little to disabuse taxpayers of the notion that the rich get a better deal from the tax system." He cited data from the "generally liberal" Citizens for Tax Justice, stating a seventeen percent flat tax would produce a revenue shortfall of $200 billion. The group also claimed Dick Armey's similar flat tax plan would raise taxes on middle class families, estimating increases in the $1,740-$4,600 range on families earning between $45,000 and $85,000. 
<p>
Stengel didn't quote a conservative expert, but for a balancing view he could have referred to Time's very own flat tax analysis of April 17, when a CPA estimated how much tax a hypothetical family of four making $50,000 could expect to pay under the Armey plan. Time found the family's taxes would be cut by almost half, from $4,249 under the existing system to $2,244 under the Armey plan.
<p>

<h3>DeParle's Platform.</h3>
Twice in December, The New York Times provided a platform for reporter Jason DeParle's personal crusade against Republican welfare reforms. In the December 17 New York Times Magazine he depicted a post-welfare reform nightmare. DeParle wrote his story as an encyclopedia entry from the year 2015 that took a look back at the history of welfare. 
<p>
The fictitious excerpt presented welfare reform as an initial success when left to the states until a recession hit in 1999: "Faced with declining revenues and rising aid requests, states slashed their payments....With families crossing borders in search of aid, the `race to the bottom' ensued, with each state trying to be as tough as its neighbors." DeParle described an almost apocalyptic state where mothers were "arrested each year for locking their children in cars as they worked." DeParle predicted a million families would be "lining up at shelters, stealing into abandoned buildings and begging on street corners." DeParle continued his gloomy forecast: "Some became more reliant on abusive boyfriends, and reports of domestic violence rose. Abortion rates hit record levels and so did arrests for prostitution, leading several cities to decriminalize the practice in specified red-light zones."
<p>

DeParle's Other Platform. Two weeks earlier in a Times "Week in Review" piece, DeParle charged: "While the Republicans promise that the poor will prosper, the evidence does not. Indeed, most suggests the opposite: whether the economy or poor people are ultimately to blame, most will fail to replace their lost benefits. If the past is a guide, less will not mean more. Less will mean less, for those who already have little." 
<p>
DeParle criticized the GOP plan to let states run welfare, taking on supposed GOP arguments such as "The programs don't help much anyway," and "Earnings will improve with time." DeParle even refuted the notion that the poor actually "will be better off by working," answering: "Or will they? No one knows how many of the five million women of AFDC will be able to find and keep work. Many have few skills and lead the kinds of chaotic lives that interfere with full-time work: sick kids, dangerous neighborhoods, abusive boyfriends, broken cars."
<p>

<h3>Newt the Destroyer? </h3>
ABC previewed the Democratic strategy to hang Republican Tom Campbell with the "Newtoid" tag, but when the strategy backfired ABC ignored the results. In Carol Lin's December 10 piece for World News Sunday she highlighted Democrat Jerry Estruth's effort to defeat Republican Campbell in a special congessional election to replace retiring Democrat Norman Mineta. Anchor Carole Simpson introduced the story: "For all of Mr. Gingrich's power on Capitol Hill, opinion polls show his star is fading with American voters. So much so that one congressional candidate in California is using the Gingrich image to beat down his once-popular Republican opponent." 
<p>
Lin reported Campbell at one point had enjoyed a 43-point lead over Estruth. "Yet this political novice has managed to cut his popular Republican opponent's lead in half. By redefining the enemy. Estruth launched an ad campaign attacking House Speaker Newt Gingrich. And labeling Tom Campbell as a Gingrich clone." Lin pointed out that Campbell was more moderate than the Speaker on many issues, "But the strategy seems to be working. With more than a million dollars in donations pouring in." Lin continued, "Democrats hope Gingrich's negatives will be the central issue that can turn election campaigns across the country," before concluding: "Campbell is still the front runner in this race but only by a narrow margin. Democrats say that alone is still a victory for their party. Because they found their weapon. The man who started the Republican revolution may give frustrated voters reason enough to bring more Democrats back to office."
<p>
So, did ABC make it a big story when Campbell trounced Estruth by 23 points on December 12? No, not a word about the result on World News Tonight.  
<p>

<h3>Hot Media Air.</h3>
CBS and ABC have recently portrayed House Republicans as the catalysts to impending global doom, but have ignored scientific studies which back the GOP. "Some House Republicans are objecting to the global agreement to ban industrial chemicals widely believed to be depleting the earth's ozone layer," Dan Rather intoned on the November 23 CBS Evening News. Eric Engberg explained "that 150 countries have signed a treaty banning production of ozone depleting chemicals," but "to the number three Republican in the House, it's Chicken Little Stuff...Time out! Not proven? Didn't this year's Nobel Prize in chemistry go to Dr. Mario Molina and two others who discovered ozone depletion?" 
<p>
Over a month later, ABC's January 4 World News Tonight ran another alarmist warning. Peter Jennings began: "Two thousand scientists from all over the world agree the earth is getting warmer all the time, in part because the United States is not practicing what it has been preaching." Ned Potter followed, "scientists say if they [temperatures] keep going up as they have heat waves will spread across North America. A third of the world's glaciers will melt, flooding coastlines in dozens of countries. Tropical diseases will spread, exposing large parts of the U.S. to malaria." Potter charged that the Clinton administration "gave in to the petroleum and auto industries" and then he allowed Vice President Al Gore to blame the House GOP. 
<p>
But the need for action isn't so clear. Washington Post science writer Boyce Rensberger reported January 8 that of the three major studies of global temperatures during 1995 one reported an increase in average temperature, one called 1995 "ordinary," and one found some cooling. Guess which two the networks have ignored?
<p>

Moyers On Wages. PBS omnipresence Bill Moyers returned to Milwaukee for the December 19 Frontline to visit two families who suffered layoffs in 1991 at the motor company Briggs and Stratton. Moyers complained: "Good-paying jobs are heading south or out of the country and workers like Tony Neumann are searching desperately for new jobs that will support their families...In the early '90s, families like the Stanleys and Neumanns were thrown into a emerging new economy built on light manufacturing and service jobs. It was a time when unemployment hit record lows. But many of the new jobs offered only part-time work and no benefits, and they paid lower wages." Moyers concluded the show: "For working people all over America, real wages continue to decline."
<p>
But in a review on the morning before the show, a sequel to the 1992 program Minimum Wages, Washington Post reporter Steven Pearlstein told a story Moyers didn't: "In fact, today there are 12,000 more manufacturing jobs in the Milwaukee area than there were in the fall of 1991 when Claude Stanley and Tony Neumann were laid off, while the average hourly wage in manufacturing has climbed from $12.54 an hour to $13.98, just about keeping pace with inflation." Pearlstein added that Briggs and Stratton motors are now cheaper for consumers and the company is making money for its stockholders.
<p>

Rather Embarrassed. While on Denver's KOA talk radio host Mike Rosen's program, Dan Rather tried to defend himself and his network against charges of bias. Rosen questioned Rather's repeated use of the word "cut" when describing the Republican Medicare plan on the CBS Evening News. Rather shot back, "Some of the time we use the language, `Medicare cuts,' which is what the Democrats insist these are, and some of the time we use that these are, `cuts in the rate of growth for Medicare,' which is what the Republicans prefer. We try to walk that line, we try to call it one way one time, one way the next time."
<p>
A review of Evening News broadcasts from September 20, the night before the Republicans unveiled their Medicare plan, to November 28, when Rather appeared on Rosen's program, shows the CBS anchor should pay closer attention to what comes out of his mouth. During this period, Rather used the Democratic spin term `cuts' eight times such as when Rather announced as fact on September 20: "Democrats and Republicans in Congress late today came close to actual physical blows over proposed cuts in Medicare. That's the separate U.S. government health care coverage for 37 million older Americans of all income levels. There's no doubt that Medicare spending will be cut, the question is how much and for how many." On October 25 he claimed that "Republicans vowed to press for huge cuts in government spending and $245 billion in tax cuts. President Clinton vowed to veto it as too radical and extreme."
<p>

He applied the phrase that best described reality, "reducing the rate of growth," or "reducing spending" three times. He relayed the Republican spin, "making the plan solvent" just once; hardly the "one way one time, one way the next time" which Rather claimed.

<h3>Networks Search for Victims in the Wake of Second Budget Stalemate<br>
The Shutdown Soap Opera</h3>
<p>
December brought a second shutdown of the federal government, and with it came the networks' ratings-grabbing specialty: hanky-waving sob stories of shutdown "victims."
<p>
On December 22, a week into the shutdown and before paychecks were delayed, Jack Smith mourned on World News Tonight: "The shutdown now has a human face. Joe Skattleberry and his wife Lisa both work for the government. Both have been furloughed. They can't afford a Christmas tree."
<p>
NBC's John Palmer warned on the December 29 Today: "The shutdown is affecting more people's lives every day in places like Grand Teton National Park, where furloughed park employees worried about mortgages, car payments, and  credit card bills have begun filing unemployment benefits. In California and in dozens of other states, serious cutbacks in food programs are threatened unless the budget crisis is resolved soon." Later, David Bloom added: "The shutdown continues. The pain spreads. The pressure grows for Washington to end America's worst budget crisis."
<p>
On January 2, CBS Evening News reporter Scott Pelley compared budget negotiators to bombers: "In April, terrorists tried to kill them. Today, politicians stopped their paychecks. In Oklahoma City's Social Security office, they're being ordered to work for nothing....The bomb broke Beverly Rankin's ankle. Politics is breaking her bank." 
<p>
That night NBC Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw mourned: "Far from the marbled halls of Congress and the elegant furnishings of the White House, this government shutdown is about a lot more than politics. It's about people and their real needs."
<p>
NBC's George Lewis found an Indian health clinic in San Diego: "Two-thirds of the clinic's budget, $95,000 a month, comes from the federal government. Without that money, the clinic can't meet its payroll. The people who run this clinic fear that if it has to close its doors, many of the 4,000 patients who seek treatment here will not look elsewhere. Ron Morton says traditionally, Native Americans do not like to accept handouts." But didn't NBC just say the clinic is two-thirds funded by the federal government? Morton later asserted that "if this budget is not signed there are people who are going to die."
<p>
Bryant Gumbel preached at the start of the January 4 Today: "Although some politicians have foolishly suggested the fact that we are going on about our business despite the absence of the workers says maybe they weren't needed anyway, we will show you how some average Americans are suffering each and every day as a result of what is now 20 days of the government shutdown."

<h3>Today Gushes Over Hillary<br>
"Really Terrific" Book</h3>
<p>
As questions swirled around Hillary Clinton's veracity on Whitewater and the travel office, NBC News gave her a gift: a January 16 Today interview by Maria Shriver, who campaigns for and donates to her uncle Ted Kennedy's Senate campaigns. Shriver served more as political flack than journalistic inquisitor. Shriver opened the show by calling Clinton's new book, It Takes a Village, "really terrific."
<p>
Her first question: "What's this last week and a half been like for you personally?" She followed up about daughter Chelsea: "What has she said to you about these attacks?...This is beyond the territory....This is your mom that someone's talking about." After wondering if she'd be willing to testify before the Senate and posing one question about the travel office, Shriver showed sympathy for Clinton's plight: "Whitewater, I know you've been answering questions on this subject for four years, thousands of pieces of documents have been handed over, but they still want even more. As you look back on this, do you wish you'd never worked for Madison Guaranty?"
<p>
Shriver did ask: "Regarding these billing records that came about that had been subpoenaed two years ago, people say, `Gosh, how could a woman as smart and politically savvy as Hillary Clinton not know where these records were these past two years? Why didn't she make that her priority to find them, particularly when they were found in her own home, under an assistant's desk?'"
<p>
Shriver returned to softballs: "You also quote a letter in there that Nelson Mandela wrote to one of his daughters while he was in prison, and I'm paraphrasing a bit, but he wrote that there is no personal misfortune that one cannot turn into a personal triumph if one has the iron will and the necessary skills. You clearly have an iron will, you clearly are skilled. How are you going to turn this personal misfortune into a personal triumph?"
<p>
Shriver then stumped for liberalism: "You think government should do a lot more than it's doing in terms of making children a priority, doing things for kids. We're clearly living in an age where people are anti-government. How do you get across the message that we all need to see everybody's kids as our own, we need to have more programs, the government needs to be more involved?"

<h3>Brinkley Agrees Media are Liberal<br>
Paula Zahn is "Overloaded"</h3>
<p>
In a December 7 appearance on CNBC's Cal Thomas, David Brinkley reacted with dismay when read a quote from the MRC's Best Notable Quotables of 1995: The Eighth Annual Awards for the Year's Worst Reporting.
<p>
Thomas, one of the judges who voted on which quotes deserved inclusion in the year-end issue, asked: "Could you get away, for example, with asking a question like this, that was recently asked by a major network anchor of Pat Buchanan...`You've got political enemies out there calling you an isolationist, a bigot, you're anti-gay, and some even go so far as saying your social stands are reminiscent of Nazi Germany.' Now that's the kind of ideologically loaded stuff that turns a lot of people off, isn't it?"
<p>
Brinkley agreed: "That is so loaded, it's overloaded and it destroys itself in its own excess. Nobody would ever take that question seriously, I wouldn't even bother to answer it." Though Brinkley didn't know it, the quote, first runner-up for the "Damn Those Conservatives Award," came from Paula Zahn's July 5 CBS This Morning interview.
<p>
Earlier in the show the former NBC anchor and current This Week host acknowledged liberal bias."Well, it's there and it doesn't show itself in everything that is printed or broadcast but it is there, and I think we're all used to it, we discount it. Some of the press also is more conservative and it's just the way the action is in this country and I don't know any way to change it. You just have to live with it."

<center><h2>Revoving Door, from the January 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<h3>If You Can't Boost 'Em...</h3>
<p>
Just weeks after writing a piece for The New Republic denouncing Republican efforts to shut down AmeriCorps, Newsweek Deputy Washington Bureau Chief Steven Waldman decided he could do more good helping run the government program than he could as an external advocate. In mid-January he became senior adviser for policy planning and evaluation for former Senator Harris Wofford (D-Penn.), the new Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation for National Service, overseer of AmeriCorps and VISTA. 
<p>
Waldman "explained that the program's recent change in leadership convinced him that the move would be ethical even though he's written extensively about the program," National Journal reported.
<p>
"Republican attacks on AmeriCorps have been bizarrely hyperbolic," Waldman charged in the November 13 New Republic. "The GOP has also practiced gross statistics-abuse in order to portray AmeriCorps, inaccurately, as a boondoggle." He predicted that "when Republicans calm down and start picking bits of safety net from their teeth, they will undoubtedly feel silly. They will realize that AmeriCorps -- which gives college scholarships to young men and women who do full-time community service -- was the solution to their dilemma of how to dismantle the welfare state without seeming cruel."
<p>
Earlier in 1995 Waldman, part of Newsweek's Washington bureau since 1987, wrote The Bill, a book detailing the creation of AmeriCorps. It grew out of a "behind-the-scenes" look at the program for the September 20, 1993 Newsweek, in which he concluded: "John F. Kennedy attracted to his Peace Corps a narrow group of mostly white, well-educated Americans. Clinton's plan is far more ambitious, seeking to regenerate fragmented American communities and break down rock-hard barriers of the heart. Because Clinton must confront the emotional issues of race and class, he is more likely to fail. But should he succeed, Clinton will have accomplished something far more significant than his hero ever did."
<p>
AmeriCorps is hardly the only area in which Waldman has been a liberal advocate. He co-authored a September 19, 1994 piece headlined, "The Lost Chance" with the subhead, "The Clintons: Newsweek reveals how they set out to reform a broken health care system -- and squandered a historic opportunity." One impediment: those who spent money "on blatantly untrue advertisements meant to scare the public."
<p>
A few issues later his byline accompanied a story on the Contract with America: "The problem is that the Contract's main idea has already been tried and discredited. House Republicans are now pledged to tax cuts, increased defense spending, and a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. Sound familiar? `This was a dopey political move,' [Rep. Fred] Grandy says. `We were holding the high ground on welfare, foreign policy, so why would we go back and shoosh down the Laffer Curve? This is like giving the Democrats a nuclear weapon.'" 
<p>

<h3>Being Frank</h3>
<p>
A CNN veteran is the new Deputy Press Secretary to Senator Frank Lautenberg. Ken Jaques, an off-air reporter in the CNN political unit from 1992 to 1994, has come aboard the New Jersey Democrat's staff, Roll Call reported December 21.

<center><h2>Study, from the January 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<p>
<h3>Networks Mourn Victims of Second Shutdown, Single Out Republicans for Blame<br>
Same Liberal Song, Second Verse</h3>
<p>
As a second partial government shutdown descended on Washington, network coverage once again favored President Clinton's arguments  over those of House Republicans. Last month, MediaWatch examined coverage during the November 13-20 shutdown and found not a single story noted how much more than the GOP  Clinton wanted to spend. No story questioned his rhetoric about "destroying" Medicare even though the GOP plan called for hikes. Reporters conveyed the Democratic spin about the disastrous impact upon federal workers and the public.
<p>
As a new budget impasse began in mid-December, MediaWatch analysts reviewed all 131 budget-related stories on evening newscasts (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly News, and CNN's World News) from the evening before the shutdown (December 14) through the day it ended (January 5).
<p>
After President Clinton vetoed several spending bills, not one story blamed Clinton for the shutdown, but nearly two dozen declared the GOP culpable. Furloughed workers and other "victims" were featured in half the stories while no story explored the "Washington Monument" stategy or the financial boost offered by a balanced budget.
<p>
Blame. To fund the government, Congress passes appropriation bills which the President must then sign. Clinton vetoed spending bills on December 18 and 19 that would have kept open six cabinet departments. But on the question of who caused the shutdown, reporters exclusively pointed a finger at the Republicans. In the 48 stories in which reporters allocated blame, 23 assigned blame to the Republicans, but not one held Clinton culpable (25 blamed both).
<p>
On December 16, when the government's temporary spending authority ran out, Bob Schieffer led off the CBS Evening News like a disappointed father: "Well, they've done it again. Nine days from Christmas, Republicans have forced another partial shutdown of the government because they cannot come to an agreement with the White House on how to balance the budget." The next night, ABC's Jerry King also blamed the GOP. "There's no indication from House Republicans, whose budget-cutting zeal started all of this, that they are ready, Christmas season or not, to end it."
<p>
During the negotiations that followed the vetoes, reporters repeatedly blamed Republicans for not compromising. On December 23 CNN's Wolf Blitzer pined for an earlier time: "In the old days, the two sides would simply have split the differences, but House Republicans say they are proud to be revolutionaries...From the White House perspective there's still one very big wild card: the most militant House Republicans say they're in no mood to compromise. The question remains whether Speaker Gingrich can reign them in, or wants to."
<p>
Even as Clinton delayed agreement by breaking his promises to release a seven-year balanced budget, the networks still blamed the GOP. ABC's Peter Jennings intoned on January 4, "We begin in Washington tonight, where the Republicans and the Clinton administration may be inching their way towards a partial resolution of the government shutdown. President Clinton and the Republican leaders in Congress have been meeting almost daily this week, but today the Republicans apparently felt the need to reassess their position, which has kept a quarter of a million government employees off the job."
<p>
Spending. None of the 131 stories compared the higher levels of spending both sides proposed. Only two mentioned the levels of spending in the President's plan or the Republican plan, one coming not in a news story, but in a CBS commentary by Joe Klein.
<p>
Federal Workers. Only 280,000 workers were placed on furlough, just 15 percent of the work force. Still, the media focused on the issue in nearly half the stories (62), while only three reports focused on overburdened taxpayers. ABC's John Martin examined those angry at the de facto paid vacation on December 18: "This time government workers have an added worry -- Congress has been hearing from people who do not want to pay furloughed workers as they were paid after last month's shutdown."
<p>
"Victims." Sixty-seven of 131 stories mentioned a victim of the shutdown. Thirty stories called attention to families being turned away from National Parks or Smithsonian Museums. On December 22, CBS looked at how the stalemate canceled a re-creation of an Olde English Christmas banquet. John Blackstone reported, "For thousands of people, a Christmas dream is a traditional Christmas in Yosemite National Park. But the budget stalemate has closed the park gates and Yosemite's old fashioned Christmas is slipping away....The valley has somehow been drained of a seasonal joy it's known for almost 70 years." Although not by a reporter, in this story both sides were blamed as one of the participants wrote a poem about the cancellation in which she referred to Newt Gingrich as "slimebucket" and Clinton as "sleaze."
<p>
"Washington Monument." Not one report brought up the "Washington Monument" game being played when high profile services, like national parks and passport offices are closed in order to maximize inconvenience. No report questioned why these services were stopped even though, as The Wall Street Journal found, one-third of the federal workers at the Interior Department and two-thirds of State Department employees were considered essential and thus were on the job. 
<p>
Upside to the Shutdown. If you relied exclusively on the evening news, you would never have thought there was an upside to the shutdown. Only twice did a report call attention to a positive effect of the shutdown. Both were on CNN and dealt with the airline ticket tax expiring at the end of 1995. Anchor Linden Soles announced on January 1, "Washington's budget battle has reaped a windfall for air travelers," saving these travelers $12 million a day. But NBC anchor Brian Williams saw just the opposite the same day: "We have this footnote to the mess here in Washington tonight, because of it a tax on domestic airline tickets expired at midnight so while the budget negotiators are arguing about the best way to save money, the government is actually losing money."
<p>
Similarly, never mentioned were the benefits of a balanced budget. The Washington Post reported January 4 that experts estimated a balanced budget would give $1,000 annually to families through lower interest rates.  
<p>
For years, the media have complained about politicians ducking the tough issues; debating slogans, not substance. Finally, a substantive policy dispute presents itself. Unfortunately, the media aren't able to overcome their biases and look beyond the very bumper sticker politics they formerly decried.

ABC Promotes A Green "Demonstration" That Didn't Happen, Ignores March for Life
<p>
The Evangelical Right Wing That Wasn't 
<p>
Pro-life activists gather together in the nation's capital every January 22 to mark the anniversary of the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide. This year, 60,000 came to Washington for the annual March for Life, but the networks didn't pay much attention.
<p>
NBC Nightly News and CBS Evening News each gave the event 19 seconds. CBS followed up with a long story about the federal investigation into anti-abortion violence. CNN also had an anchor brief, although reporter Anthony Collings did a story the night before. On the day of the march, CNN's Inside Politics didn't mention the march, but devoted more than seven minutes to an interview with pro-choice Republicans Ann Stone and Julie Finley.
<p>
ABC's World News Tonight didn't even mention the march. But just nine days later, on January 31, Peter Jennings announced a "major demonstration on behalf of the environment designed to pressure those congressional Republicans who wish to eliminate or dilute many of the country's environmental laws. ABC's Barry Serafin reports that the pressure comes from a group of the Republican conservatives' strongest supporters." For ignoring the march of religious conservatives against abortion and then promoting the activities of a small group of religious liberals as if they were conservatives, ABC earned the Janet Cooke Award. 
<p>
Serafin explained: "Protecting the environment is a relatively new issue for evangelical Christians. But a group called the Evangelical Environmental Network [EEN] says it will spend a million dollars on a campaign to block efforts by congressional conservatives to weaken the Endangered Species Act, starting with a television commercial in 18 states." ABC aired a section of the ad which asserted: "The Endangered Species Act has rescued dozens of God's creatures from extinction. But today, the Act itself is threatened."
<p>
Serafin added that the group encouraged children to write letters lobbying Newt Gingrich to stop the GOP bill, before concluding: "The evangelical delegation in Washington delivered some of the children's letters, but it was unable to meet with Gingrich today. Gingrich's position on the Endangered Species Act is still a question. A bigger question is how congressional conservatives will deal with opposition from those they usually consider political allies." 
<p>
ABC's report was grossly misleading for a number of reasons. Despite Jennings' insistence, there was no "major demonstration." ABC showed no video of a demonstration, only a shot of a few professionals in overcoats walking outside the Capitol. In other words, ABC had ignored a major demonstration of 60,000 pro-lifers, only to cover one that did not even occur. The Environmental Information Center (EIC), which other news accounts identified as the million-dollar funder behind the evangelical group's ads against GOP reform of the Endangered Species Act, told MediaWatch there was no demonstration, only a press conference. 
<p>
In an August 19, 1995 Washington Post story about the activities of the liberal environmental groups Greenpeace, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, and the Sierra Club to stop Republican proposals to strengthen the rights of property owners, reporter Gary Lee noted the liberal strategy behind the founding of EIC: "The major conservation groups and a few private donors and foundations pooled their resources last spring to create the Environmental Information Center, a new lobbying organization charged with doing whatever it takes to stop the anti-environmental tide in Washington." 
<p>
The Post noted EIC spent $1.3 million during last year's House debate on regulatory reform on TV ads saying "Don't let Congress roll back 25 years of environmental progress." But ABC identified these liberal activists as "a group of the Republican conservatives' strongest supporters" and "those they usually consider political allies." 
<p>
Not only has the Environmental Evangelical Network taken sides on the environmental issues, it has taken sides against the religious right as well. The February 1 San Diego Union Tribune noted EEN leaders "were critical of the environmental stands of some conservative Christian groups, such as the politically influential Christian Coalition." ABC aired a soundbite of Ron Sider, President and founder of Evangelicals for Social Action, the EEN's parent organization. But they did not note he signed a document last May called the "Cry for Renewal." The primary authors of the letter, leftist Sojourners magazine editor Jim Wallis and Clinton friend Tony Campolo, declared their intention to create a "progressive evangelical caucus" to challenge traditionally conservative evangelical events and hold town meetings to address community problems like "gay bashing." ABC did not reconcile Sider's partisan press conference with his signature on the "Cry for Renewal" document, which declared "religion as a political cheerleader is inevitably false as religion."
<p>
ABC denigrated Republican stands with pejorative adjectives ("eliminate," "dilute," "weaken") without allowing the GOP to explain their side of the debate. Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, and Rep. Richard Pombo (R-Calif.) issued a press release the day after the ABC telecast asking the Evangelical Environmental Network to be honest in their characterization of the Republican bill, which currently has 126 co-sponsors in the House. Among the major provisions of the bill is an actual increase in funding for Endangered Species Act programs. 
<p>
ABC's blindness to opposing views extended to free-market environmental experts like Ike Sugg of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, who told MediaWatch the Young-Pombo bill "doesn't go nearly far enough. They tried to pre-emptively compromise, and Gingrich is seeking to water it down further. The Republicans are not guilty of what they're accused of."
<p>
Sugg added: "The Young-Pombo bill is a step in the right direction since it weakens the federal government's power over private land use. But the current Endangered Species Act has created perverse incentives for property owners to remove any possibility of endangered species appearing on their property. It creates an enmity between wildlife and land owners. The ESA's supporters care more about saving the act than saving wildlife." 
<p>
Serafin did not return phone calls to discuss his story. ABC's story contrast suggests the irony of their biases. Their focus suggests heart-tugging concern for the kangaroo rat, but not the unborn child. ABC sometimes labels the religious right as "ultraconservative," but the religious left receives no label, or worse yet, is portrayed as conservative. But the worst characteristic of their reporting is the absolute refusal to acknowledge that issues they advance with partisan passion have more than one side.

<center><h2>Newsbites, from the February 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<p>
<h3>Tricky Dick's Tax Break.</h3>
When Rep. Jennifer Dunn (R-Wash.) filed an ethics complaint against House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt for possibly illegally evading capital gains taxes on a land swap, the story's hypocrisy angle seemed obvious. Insight reported last summer that Gephardt, who dem-agogues against capital gains tax cuts as windfalls for the rich, listed a beachfront property he was purchasing as an investment property, thus avoiding tax on a $79,500 capital gain. To obtain a loan to build on the North Carolina property, he signed a covenant pledging the house would be used as a second home, and not as an investment property. 
<p>
Reporters had two chances to make Gephardt's hypocrisy a news story, one when Dunn filed the complaint February 2, and another when Gephardt's lawyer denied the allegations a week later. Despite short stories in The Washington Post and The New York Times, in both cases the network evening news programs completely ignored the allegations.
<p>

<h3>Newt Left Hanging.</h3>
Last July, when the National Republican Congressional Committee printed a Wanted poster featuring targeted Democrats, CNN thoroughly covered the ensuing outrage from Democrats. The NRCC Wanted poster merely pictured Democratic incumbents up for re-election in 1996. CNN gave the most coverage overall of the poster, airing stories on the July 10 and July 15 Inside Politics as well as on World News for July 12 and 13. Declared anchor Bobbie Battista: "Some of the Democrats pictured on a Republican Wanted poster are complaining the ad is racist and could even put their lives in danger." The next day anchor Linden Soles reported, "Democrats say the poster is racist, anti-semitic and could even lead to physical attacks against them." 
<p>
So where was CNN when the Democratic National Committee (DNC) posted a Hangman game on its Web site that depicted Newt Gingrich as hanging from a gallows? According to John Pitney in the January 29 Weekly Standard, "For each correct guess, the site added a new part to a stick figure and displayed a different quotation from Gingrich. At the end of the game, the screen showed the stick figure hanging from a gallows, above the game's magic word: EXTREMIST." Surely, the lynching of the Speaker of the House on an official DNC computer Web page deserved at least a brief spot. But neither CNN's Inside Politics or The World Today aired a report on the Hangman game. A review of the three other major networks showed they also failed to mention the DNC's ghoulish depiction of Gingrich on the gallows.
<p>

<h3>PBS on Privates.</h3>
Are the personal lives of politicians relevant? Apparently, the PBS answer is "only if they're Republicans." On January 16, the tax-funded documentary series Frontline devoted an hour to the rise of Newt Gingrich, which included tales of how friends had to raise money to feed Newt's kids because he wouldn't pay alimony. Frontline also aired a man heckling Gingrich at a book signing: "You profess family values. This is hidden wisdom in the Holy Bible. And I want to know where it says oral sex doesn't count as adultery. I'd like you to sign it because, you know, you've been cheating on your wife. You've been crying family values. I don't know where it says oral sex is moral while you're trying to take away children's rights and children's benefits." 
<p>
But Frontline has almost completely avoided dealing with Bill Clinton's sex life. The only snippet came on March 3, 1992, in a documentary on racist David Duke, who declared: "I am not a wizard under the sheets. I have to leave that title to Bill Clinton from Arkansas." But that's about it. The October 21, 1992 Frontline titled "The Choice," a two-hour history of Bush and Clinton, leaped at the very end from Clinton's announcement speech in 1991 to the Los Angeles riots. There was no Gennifer Flowers. In 1995, Frontline aired "What Happened to Bill Clinton?" The answer: He hadn't been liberal enough. PBS said nothing about the allegations of state troopers or the sexual harassment lawsuit of Paula Jones. 
<p>

<h3>Another Travelgate Yawn.</h3>
While promoting her new book in January, First Lady Hillary Clinton defended her role in the May 1993 firing of the White House Travel Office staff. She said "financial mismanagement" justified the action. But a  recent audit by the General Accounting Office shows that whatever the situation in 1993, it has only gotten worse.
<p>
According to an Associated Press story that appeared in the January 30 Washington Post and Washington Times, an audit by the General Accounting Office found: "The current travel office rarely follows its own policy of paying vendors, such as airlines and telephone companies, within 45 days of the invoice date....office employees never balanced checkbooks from January through August 1995." The audit also found that the office's accounts receivable had soared to $5.6 million under the new management, while the employees that were fired had only $366,000. The new employees also forgot to enter over $200,000 in deposits into the office's checking accounts.
<p>
The audit drew little national media attention. The New York Times, Los Angeles Times and USA Today all failed to report the embarrassing revelations. With the exception of the NewsHour on PBS, no network evening news show ran a story. Neither did Time or Newsweek.
<p>

<h3>Hillary's Decade of Greed.</h3>
Newsweek's Martha Brant and Evan Thomas analyzed the duality of Hillary Clinton in the January 15 issue. Instead of condemning her as a hypocrite for trashing the "greed is good" 1980s in public while cashing in on her influence in private, the Newsweek duo marveled at her "missionary zeal" as a liberal crusader. "The same zeal that is so impressive in her fight for worthy causes," Brant and Thomas suggested, "can also lead her (at best) to be politically insensitive and (at worst) to be ruthless about getting her way." 
<p>
The article shows why Hillary never resorted to ruthlessness when dealing with the press on Whitewater; reporters like Brant and Thomas are willing to rationalize her behavior: "It has fallen mostly to Hillary to finance the Clinton's public service. (As governor, her husband never earned more than $35,000 a year.) To the outside world, her commodities trading -- a $1,000 investment to make $100,000 -- looks suspiciously cozy. And the family's lost investment in the failed Whitewater land development has the smell of a sweet deal turned sour...Although she would never admit it, she may feel that she was relatively restrained in Little Rock, given the temptations of her position and the culture of the place. For a governor's wife who was also a senior partner in a politically connected law firm, the opportunity for lucrative deals must have been huge."
<p>
Zuckerman's Zero Interest. Liberals often claim that media owners push the media to the right. Not so at U.S. News & World Report where owner Mortimer Zuckerman liked investigating George Bush, but is not so happy about probing the Clintons. Zuckerman used a two-page editorial on January 29 to lambaste Republican handling of the Whitewater hearings. He recalled Joseph Welch's famous dictum, "Have you no sense of decency?" from the Army-McCarthy hearings of the 1950s as he regurgitated the Clintons' public relations line that a report prepared for the RTC by former Republican U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens cleared the Clintons. On the issue of the billing records that were discovered nearly two years after being subpoenaed (and which contradict the RTC report), Zuckerman wrote: "What about the time sheets showing the amount of legal work that Hillary Clinton performed for the failed S&L?...Again, no. Her role...was minimal." 
<p>
The editorial led to a January 26 guest appearance on Michael Jackson's KABC talk show in Los Angeles. Talk Daily reported that "he called the charges against the Clintons `outrageous' (a term he used several times)," claimed that in the First Lady's Madison dealings "all transactions were legitimate," was "disgusted" by the investigation and considered much of the press coverage a "witch hunt." 
<p>
Zuckerman's U.S. News piece also attacked fellow journalists for investigating a Democrat: "The press has slipped its moorings here...The two questions now -- what did the President's wife know and when did she know it? -- seem a childish irrelevance by comparison [to Watergate]." However in his own June 22, 1992 editorial on Iraqgate, Zuckerman suggested the Bush administration obstructed justice, claiming: "Certainly the attempts to limit inquiries by Congress on the spurious grounds of national security smell of coverup....In short, what did the administration know and when did it know it?"
<p>

<h3>California Scheming. </h3>
Host Jane Pauley's introduction to the January 23 Dateline NBC dripped with sarcasm: "Do you feel that everyone is after your job, and they just might have an unfair advantage? That people can criticize you and it's OK? Are you a white American male? In California, two men have taken up the cause of the beleaguered species. They've written a ballot proposal that, if passed in November, would change affirmative action in California's state hiring and education admissions." Reporter Josh Mankiewicz charged, "They (Glynn Custred and Tom Wood) are portrayed as `genial scholars,' just two `apolitical professors,' an image Wood and Custred have worked hard to maintain."
<p>
Then Mankiewicz moved to discredit them: "The two are key figures in a conservative organization...very critical of many aspects of higher education, including black and women's studies, sexual harassment policies, the emphasis on racial diversity, and affirmative action." John Leo of U.S. News & World Report took exception to the Mankiewicz segment in the February 19 issue: "Senator Joe himself couldn't have phrased this better. It artfully left the impression that NAS [the National Association of Scholars, to which Wood and Custred belong] is a sinister, antiwoman, antiblack group." In fact, Leo noted that "a prominent Marxist, Eugene Genovese, sits on the board of advisers."
<p>
Mankiewicz criticized the men for not having statistics on how many white men have suffered discrimination, but Leo pointed out "Nobody has good statistics on this. Since a lot of reverse discrimination is legal under Title VII [of the Civil Rights Act], many who are hurt by it never bother to file any complaints and thus don't get counted."
<p>

<h3>Judge Baer Not Bared.</h3>
<p>
When Federal Judge Harold Baer threw out the key evidence  in a New York drug arrest, $4 million in cocaine and heroin, only one news magazine noted that the Clinton administration had appointed the judge. All four networks ran stories on the case, explaining how the judge tossed the evidence, which officers found in a duffel bag they earlier saw being placed inside a car, under the guise of it being obtained through an illegal search. A story on NBC's February 6 Dateline noted that the woman charged admitted to being a drug runner and that Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) now regretted suggesting Baer be nominated. But none of the networks noted the Clinton link. 
<p>
U.S. News & World Report was the only news magazine to make the connection between Clinton and Baer. However reporter Ted Gest, writing in the February 12 issue, failed to tie Baer's ruling with any liberal leanings. Analyzing the administration's judicial choices, he wrote, "Clinton's Supreme Court choices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, are moderates, and so are most of his lower court appointees...Assistant Attorney General Eleanor Acheson...stresses diversity without sacrificing quality." Quality that let a $4 million admitted drug trafficker go free.

<h3>CBS Reporter Bernard Goldberg Charges Colleague, <br>Media with Liberal Bias
Reality Check for Eric Engberg</h3></center>
<p>
This month MediaWatch planned to include an article about CBS reporter Eric Engberg's February 8 CBS Evening News "Reality Check" attack on Steve Forbes' flat tax. But one of Engberg's colleagues beat us to it. In an unprecedented February 13 Wall Street Journal op-ed, CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg said that "Mr. Engberg's report set new standards for bias." Reaction was swift: CBS News President Andrew Heyward tagged the charge "absurd." 
<p>
Goldberg began by observing that one reason fewer people are watching network news "is that our viewers simply don't trust us. And for good reason. The old argument that the networks and other `media elites' have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore. No, we don't sit around in dark corners and plan strategies on how we're going to slant the news. We don't have to. It comes naturally to most reporters."
<p>
Reciting the story, he noted that Engberg showed Forbes saying the "economy can grow twice as fast if we remove `obstacles,' starting with the tax code. Mr. Forbes may be right or wrong about this, so Mr. Engberg lets us know which it is. `Time Out!' he shouts in his signature style. `Economists say nothing like that has ever actually happened.'"  
<p>
Next, Engberg showed Forbes asserting "A flat tax would enable the economy to grow. That would mean more revenue for Washington." To that "Engberg tells the audience: `That was called supply- side economics under President Reagan. Less taxes equal more revenue. It didn't work out that way.'" Engberg then allowed an economist from the Brookings Institution, which he failed to label as liberal, to predict the same thing would happen again. 
<p>
Goldberg wondered: "But haven't other experts argued that we wound end up with `hideous deficits' not because of the tax cut but because of increased spending?"
<p>
Engberg offered this snide hit: "OK, how about Forbes' number one wackiest flat tax promise?" In a clip, Forbes explained how "parents would have more time to spend with their children, and with each other." Goldberg queried, "can you imagine, in your wildest dreams, a network news reporter calling Hillary Clinton's health care plan `wacky?'" Engberg concluded: "The fact is, the flat tax is one giant untested theory. One economist suggested that before we risk putting it in, we ought to try it out someplace, like maybe Albania." 
<p>
"Reality Check," Goldberg explained, "suggests the viewers are going to get the facts. And then they can make up their mind. As Mr. Engberg might put it: `Time Out!' You'd have a better chance of getting the facts someplace else -- like Albania."

<h3>Networks Scared of Flat Tax<br>
Furious At Forbes</h3>
<p>
The higher Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes rose in the polls, the more reporters felt compelled to discredit his flat tax proposal, often by trying to stir class envy.
<p>
In the February 8 Investor's Business Daily reporter Thomas McArdle uncovered the agenda. In mid-January ABC News interviewed Alvin Rabushka, a Senior Fellow with the Hoover Institution and an architect of the flat tax idea, for a Peter Jennings piece. 
Rabushka told McArdle that "the cameras rolled for an hour, and throughout the hour, over and over again, he kept trying to get me to agree it would be a tax on the middle class, if not in the long run, then at least in the interim period. And over and over I wouldn't say it." Rabushka concluded that Jennings just wanted to "get me to say the 18-second soundbite he wanted to use to discredit Steve Forbes."
<p>
Indeed, Rabushka did not appear in Jennings' January 15 World News Tonight story in which he tagged the flat tax as "a very radical notion." Jennings wondered "Will plumbers be hurt more than plutocrats? President Clinton believes that middle class homeowners will see the value of their homes go down if there is no mortgage deduction. And charities worry about how generous folks will be if their contribution is no longer deductible. Certainly the rich would do better than the middle class."
<p>
Two days later NBC's Mike Jensen looked at three families, concluding as fact: "For poor and middle class families, critics say the 17 percent flat tax is a cruel hoax, that to avoid big deficits, it would have to be much higher than 17 percent. So not only would it fail to help the poor, it would increase taxes for most middle class Americans."
<p>
Nightline devoted its February 1 edition to a 30-minute assault. Robert Krulwich went through four supposed benefits of the flat tax, concluding each was wrong. As for fairness, he decided that "it doesn't seem fair that while" millionaire candidate Morry Taylor "pays zero tax on his $15 million" in stock sales, "his employees -- because they're not getting stock, they're on a salary -- they pay a 17 percent tax on their money; but that's what happens when you eliminate capital gains."
<p>
As for whether it's simpler, Krulwich decided it's not because not everyone will really be able to do their taxes on a postcard. Moving on to the third claim of lower taxes for everyone, he countered: "Sounds wonderful, but then Forbes' tax helps some more than others, especially wealthy families. Still, somebody must lose and the government could be the big loser. Forbes' tax could cut government revenues by $40 billion a year or $180 billion, depending upon who you ask, which means deeper cuts in programs" or bigger deficits.
<p>
On the last claim, that it "will be good for the economy," he explained how "Forbes is an old-fashioned, kick-up-your-heels optimist. He believes if you don't tax savings, people will save a lot more. If you don't tax investment income, people will invest a lot more, and in the end, the economy will grow a lot more." He countered that "history does not bless Steve Forbes' optimism." For the rest of the show Ted Koppel interviewed two opponents: Newsweek columnist Robert Samuelson and the magazine's Wall Street editor Allan Sloan, who sneered, "when I first heard it, I almost fell on the floor laughing wondering how anyone could take it seriously."

<h3>Global Warming Shtick Returns<br>
The Heat Is Off </h3>
<p>
Snow in Arizona, ice in Mississippi, and record low temperatures in between? It must be global warming. So said Newsweek's January 22 cover story: "The Hot Zone: Blizzards, Floods, & Hurricanes: Blame Global Warming."
<p>
Senior Writer Sharon Begley promoted Goddard Institute scientist James Hansen (an early and influential exponent of global warming). The story included a graph claiming, "The average surface temperature of the earth has risen more than 1.5 degrees in the last 135 years."
<p>
Begley noted how some scientists are skeptical, but didn't detail their evidence. Instead, she concluded by endorsing Hansen's theory of immenent climate change, writing "to many people trudging along streets lined with urban Himalayas last week, it already has."
Reporter Bob Dotson fingered the same suspect to explain the weather on the February 2 Dateline NBC: "Despite the cold, last year was the hottest on record. Mix those two extremes, says Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, and stir with global warming." Dotson failed to tell viewers that Oppeheimer is a long-time promoter of warming scenarios for the liberal Environmental Defense Fund. 
<p>
Both got their data from the University of East Anglia, whose climate researchers anointed 1995 the warmest year ever after measuring the Earth's surface temperature for the first 11 months of data, making an "educated guess" about December.
<p>
Oops.
<p>
Reporter Kathy Sawyer in the January 26 Washington Post pointed out "Temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere plummeted in December by almost 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit," a drop "unprecedented in the 17-year satellite record." She cited figures from NOAA, whose satellite data showed that out of 17 years included in their research, "1995 was only about the eighth-warmest year." 
Ronald Bailey, producer of Ben Wattenberg's Think Tank on PBS wrote in the February 5 Weekly Standard that "One climate scientist at NASA speculated that the East Anglia group was afraid that if they waited, December temperatures might plummet and they'd lose their opportunity for a scary headline." Bailey suggested a more accurate headline: "'95 Eighth-Warmest Year on Record."

<h3>Knowledgeable Limbaugh Dittoheads<br>
Not The Media Caricature</h3>
<p>
In his just published book, Hot Talk: All Talk, All the Time, Washington Post media reporter Howard Kurtz argues that talk radio, especially Rush Limbaugh, has a corrosive effect on society as hosts heighten division and spread misinformation. But a new poll by Kurtz' own newspaper found that listening to Limbaugh may be the antidote, not the cause, of public ignorance as his listeners are among the best informed Americans.
<p>
A major Washington Post survey revealed an incredible level of ignorance as 40 percent of the public could not name the Vice President, 47 percent failed to identify the House Speaker, 66 percent had no idea who is U.S. Senate Majority Leader, 94 percent were unable to name the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and 58 percent thought the U.S. spends more on foreign aid than Medicare. 
<p>
But Limbaugh listeners are in a better league. As the Post noted January 29, "They are much more knowledgeable than most about what goes on inside the Beltway and, although they are among the least trusting of the federal government, they are also among the most politically engaged voters." Over 80 percent are registered voters, "compared to only a quarter of non-dittoheads."
<p>
The poll demonstrated just how far off the mark reporters have been. In a January 1995 NBC Nightly News Bob Faw asked whether "talk radio is not democracy in action, but democracy run amok." Writing a Washington Post book review last May former CBS and NBC reporter Marvin Kalb charged: "Cut off the funding for NPR, or gradually reduce its funding to the point where it becomes a mere shadow of its usual robust, sensible self, and the American people may find themselves left with nothing much more than Rush and dozens of his mini-clones for information about the world. For Limbaugh's `dittoheads,' this may be the most splendid of tomorrows, but for other more thoughtful listeners, it may be the bleakest of forecasts." 
<p>
Six in ten Limbaugh listeners "have very little confidence in the news media." Sounds like dittoheads have a better understanding of the media than the media have of them.

<h2><center>Revolving Door from the February 1996 MediaWatch</center></h2>
<p>
<h3>NBC Goes Left with Moyers</h3>
<p>
Three months after the electorate rejected liberal policies, NBC News decided to hire Bill Moyers, a Democratic political activist and left-wing crusader on PBS since leaving CBS News in 1986, to offer commentary on its third place Nightly News. A Deputy Director of the Peace Corps and Press Secretary to President Lyndon Johnson, Moyers began his new duties on February 14, though he will continue his PBS work. NBC has no plans to provide a conservative counter-weight.
<p>
The New York Times relayed February 1 that NBC News President Andy Lack dismissed questions about Moyers' liberal bias at PBS, insisting "that perception is inside the beltway, and perhaps inside about ten blocks of New York and ten blocks of L.A. I don't think the American people give a whit about it." The same day the Baltimore Sun quoted Moyers: "I'm not in politics. I have no agenda. I'm not pushing a platform. I have no ideology."
<p>
Really? In a 1989 Esquire profile Moyers tagged Newt Gingrich "Joe McCarthy with a southern accent." Some other non-ideological quotes:
<p>
From a March 1991 address to the Democratic Issues Conference: "I was raised on mother's milk and Roosevelt speeches, and over the years, I still cherish the party's defining stands." Taking on Democrats from the left, he charged: "By the 1980s, when the Democrats in Congress colluded with Ronald Reagan and the Republicans to revise the tax code on behalf of the rich, it appeared the party had lost its soul."
<p>
In comments during the 1992 PBS press tour: "What liberalism is, is a belief that a democracy like ours has to be tolerant. Has to open itself to ideas, that the answer to a bad idea is a better idea. Civility. I mean, I'd like to think that's what liberalism is. I define myself in that sense as a liberal." On conservatives: "I find it very hard to have intelligent conversations with people on the right wing because they want to hit first and ask questions later. And I just simply don't let that criticism set my agenda." 
<p>
From a September 1991 Washington Post Magazine interview: "The right gets away with blaming liberals for their efforts to help the poor, but what the right is really objecting to is the fact that the poor are primarily black. The man who sits in the White House today [George Bush] opposed the Civil Rights Act. So did Ronald Reagan. This crowd is really fighting a retroactive civil rights war to prevent the people they dislike because of their color from achieving success in American life."
<p>
After Mario Cuomo's 1992 Democratic convention speech, he declared on CNN: "It's worth dying prematurely so you can hear someone else do your eulogy if that someone is Mario Cuomo."
<p>
Following a 1989 PBS re-broadcast of his 1982 CBS Reports: People Like Us, he insisted: "The documentary has held up as both true and sadly prophetic. While Congress restored some of the cuts made in those first Reagan budgets, in the years since, the poor and the working poor have born the brunt of the cost of the Reagan Revolution. The hardest-hit programs have been welfare, housing and other anti-poverty measures. Even programs that were not cut have failed to keep up with inflation. Meanwhile, rich people got big tax breaks. And the middle class kept most of their subsidies intact. As a result, the Reagan years brought on a wider gap between rich and poor."
<p>
In his 1992 PBS show Listening to America, he asked candidate Bill Clinton: "What do you think the American people get for their government? We have no universal health care, we have no federal guarantee of higher education...The regulatory agencies in many cases have been gutted...Why not just say `We will have universal health care and we will raise taxes to pay for it?'"  
Sounds like he'll feel quite comfortable reporting to NBC Nightly News Executive Producer Jeff Gralnick, Press Secretary to then-Senator George McGovern in 1972.

<h3>A Social Problem Blamed on Reaganomics Fades Away in Clinton-Era Media Coverage<br>
The Incredible Shrinking Homeless</h3>
<p>
The poor may have always been with us, but the network news has often presented homelessness as a problem created by the Reagan adminstration. 
<p>
"In the 1980s, the Reagan years, the amount of government money spent to build low-income housing was cut drastically. Then the homeless began to appear on streets and in doorsteps and housing became a visible human problem," proclaimed then-NBC anchor Garrick Utley on November 3, 1990. ABC's John Martin told the same tale in reporting a 1989 homelessness march: "They staged the biggest rally on behalf of the homeless since the Reagan revolution forced severe cutbacks in government housing programs."
<p>
It mattered little that budget experts John Cogan and Timothy Muris noted in The American Enterprise in 1990 that "while budget authority for subsidized housing programs declined 77 percent (from 1981-89), the number of subsidized units and the number of families living in those units increased by one-third." Reporter Harold Dow recycled the same old media spin on the March 26, 1991 CBS Evening News: "In New York there are an estimated 70,000 homeless people, three million across America. A problem that got a lot worse during the boom times of the 1980s."      
<p>
So now that Bill Clinton has been in office for three years, has the ever-growing problem of homelessness continued to burden the White House? Or did the problem recede from the media's agenda? MediaWatch analysts used the MRC Media Tracking System to count the number of network evening news segments on homelessness in America on the four evening newscasts (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly News, and CNN's Prime News or World News). Analysts found the problem faded from the  list of priorities. In the Bush years (1989-1992), the number of homeless stories per year averaged 52.5, but in the first three years of the Clinton administration, the average dropped to 25.3 stories a year.
<p>
During the Bush administration, the story count grew from 44 in 1989 to a peak of 71 in 1990, followed by 54 stories in 1991 and 43 in 1992. By contrast, stories on America's homeless dipped slightly to 35 stories in 1993, and 32 in 1994. In 1995, the number fell dramatically to just nine. When the count is broken down by network, CNN had the widest gap in reporting during the Bush years and Clinton years (90-30), closely followed by ABC (45-16), CBS (41-15), and NBC (36-15).
<p>
But the numbers alone do not tell the whole story. The decline in homeless coverage coincided with the lessening of unsupported statistics about the size of the homeless population. CNN anchor Lou Waters announced on August 8, 1989: "A new research report is warning that homelessness in this country could easily double or triple if there is a mild recession...there now are up to 40 million Americans living on the knife edge of homelessness, just one paycheck, one domestic argument from the streets."
<p>
The willingness to wildly extrapolate the number of America's homeless began to change slightly in 1991, when the Census Bureau's partial count of the homeless in shelters and on the street reported an estimate of 220,000 homeless Americans. All four networks reported on the Census count the night it occurred (March 20, 1990). But when the Census Bureau released its official report announcing a count of 220,000 on April 12, 1991, only CNN reported it. ABC referred to the estimate on May 9, but only to note that congressional sources claimed the estimate was "meaningless."
<p>
While the stories in the Bush era regularly blamed Republican administrations, not one of the 75 homeless stories in the last three years has placed any blame on the Clinton administration. On January 21, 1993, ABC featured a report on the gaudiness of the Clinton inauguration, which reporter Judy Muller concluded: "The Republicans were criticized for their show of wealth in the face of need. The Democrats seemed to have avoided such criticism. Perhaps because President Clinton has promised to help those less fortunate. For now, not many people seem to begrudge Bill Clinton his night on the town, considering the sobering realities he faces the morning after."
<p>
Indeed, in a March 12, 1995 NBC story, reporter Giselle Fernandez warned of the consequences if congressional Republicans succeeded in trimming spending on homeless aid programs in a small $17 billion rescission bill: "Across the nation there are an estimated 20,000 homeless families. And social workers worry the crisis will only worsen if the new Congress keeps its promise and makes deep cuts in bedrock social programs and especially in public housing." Fernandez did not explain why the networks did not blame this problem on the Clinton administration: they announced plans to spend a whopping $2.1 billion in fiscal 1995 on homeless aid, more than three times the $550 million spent in the last year of the Bush administration. To NBC, reducing this dramatic increase was a "deep cut."
<p>
The only story that MediaWatch analysts found on ABC  in 1995 was an anchor brief by Catherine Crier: "A new report today from the advocacy group Children's Defense Fund finds life for millions of American children still filled with poverty and violence. In its new yearbook, the group cites Census Bureau figures showing nearly 16 million children living in poverty last year, the highest level since 1964, and among the homeless, one in four is a child." In other words, the liberal group that used to be chaired by Hillary Clinton has noted that child poverty by one measure is the worst in thirty years, but ABC never wondered whether the Clinton administration could be at fault. 
<p>
The network trend of slowly dropping the story of homelessness, and quickly transforming the issue from an indicator of Republican economic failure to a nonpartisan social problem, suggests that politics more than journalism is at play. Homelessness served as a negative campaign tool against the Republican intention to curb the unending growth of federal spending on social programs.

<P>
<H3>CBS Reporter Smears Pat Buchanan by Connecting Him to the Ku Klux Klan<BR>
-- McNamara Tries Guilt by Association </H3>
<P>
After newscasts highlighted the story of Larry Pratt, the Pat 
Buchanan campaign co-chairman who resigned to combat the discovery 
that he spoke in a number of forums where racists and other bigots 
appeared, liberal Boston Globe columnist Tom Oliphant loaded his 
February 20 column with friendly fire: "For liberals to be silent 
simply because this filth is being directed at a creature of the 
Right who happens to be on a political roll is intolerable." 
If the networks wished to investigate the charge of bigotry against 
Buchanan, they had a library of columns and an archive of video 
clips to spend weeks hunting through for examples. Instead of doing 
the hard work of combing the minutiae of his paper (and TV) trail, 
the networks decided to practice guilt by association, suggesting 
his campaign appeal is too indiscriminate, too likely to appeal to 
bigots. 
<P>
In a February 23 Nightline, ABC's Ted Koppel refined the issue: 
"It's not that Pat Buchanan today is associated with overtly 
anti-Semitic or racist acts or statements, but rather that he has 
created an image of someone who might be sympathetic to such acts 
or statements by others." Koppel not only suggested Buchanan's 
father was a regular listener to the anti-Semitic radio show of 
Father Coughlin (he later apologized when the family denied this), 
he even stooped to accusing Buchanan's little brothers of having 
beaten up Jewish kids in the 1950s.  This is odd coming from 
Koppel, who said of Bill Clinton's 1969 draft-dodging thank-you 
letter: "If we were electing that 23-year-old man, what he said and 
thought and felt at that time would be germane."  
<P> 
Koppel ended his show with a pro-Buchanan letter from Russian 
nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky charging Israel controls America's 
finances "through American Jews or Negroes." Koppel concluded: 
"It's not that Buchanan hasn't expressed some of the views that 
Zhirinovsky echoed, but perhaps he'd never realized how ugly they 
sounded until he heard them in the mouth of a genuine bigot." 
For a desperate search for damaging Buchanan allies, the other 
networks could not match CBS. For finding Buchanan guilty by 
association with people he's either repudiated or never heard of, 
CBS reporter Bob McNamara won the March Janet Cooke Award.  
On the February 28 Evening News, Dan Rather began the story: "For 
his part, Buchanan vowed to come back big in the next phase of 
primaries and immediately, quote, `lit into' Forbes during a 
southern campaign swing today, lit into Forbes as too liberal. At 
the same time, Buchanan is trying to deflect criticism that he is 
an extremist, who, at the very least, uses code words to attract 
voters with racist, bigoted views. Buchanan flatly denies this. 
Correspondent Bob Mc- Namara has been looking into it." 
 <P>
McNamara moved quickly to the issue of Buchanan's fans: "They were 
waiting 3,000 strong for Pat Buchanan outside Atlanta last night. 
They say they've been waiting for years... Here, his call to take 
back the country is a crowd pleaser. But outside the campaign, 
critics charge that Buchanan's rhetoric is making this race about 
race. And the man and his ideas are now beginning to be judged by 
the company they keep." 
<P> 
McNamara explained: "Lurking in the shadows of last month's 
Louisiana campaign, there was former Klan leader David Duke." Duke 
told CBS: "I let the word out to all my supporters in the state 
that I supported Patrick Buchanan, and if Patrick goes on to win 
the nomination, I guess part of the credit will have to go to us."  
McNamara  allowed a perfunctory rebuttal: "It is not an endorsement 
Buchanan wants, and today his backers took pains to distance their 
man from charges of extremism on economics and immigration, race, 
and religion." CBS aired Buchanan backer Rabbi Aryeh Spero: "This 
is a guilt by association, which is very dangerous to our whole 
political system." 
<P>
Focusing on racism, McNamara countered: "Today, even in the New 
South, old ideas have not been completely laid to rest. And for 
people uncomfortable with the way the world has changed, Buchanan's 
message is hitting home....Danny Carver is a roofing contractor, a 
Christian, and a lifetime member of the Ku Klux Klan. He says he 
and Buchanan speak the same language." Carver told McNamara: "About 
everything he says we agree with....When he's talking about 
affirmative action he has to be talking about women and niggers, I 
guess." McNamara asked: "Do you think Buchanan would want to hear 
that you support him?" Carver replied: "He would want to hear it, 
but he don't want it on TV." 
<P>
CBS didn't explain how Carver came to their attention. He's not an 
unknown, but a self-promoting semi-regular on Howard Stern's 
syndicated radio show. Stern, who's Jewish and calls Carver a 
"lunatic," has featured him as the butt of humor on his Butt Bongo 
Fiesta video (where he struck out in the game "Guess Who's the 
Jew"), and as a judge of the topless "Miss Howard Stern" contest in  
a 1993 New Year's Eve pay-per-view special. 
<P>
McNamara concluded: "The Buchanan campaign said tonight that it 
adamantly rejects all forms of racism as immoral, saying that their 
campaign is, quote, `populated by people who embrace the sense of 
justice in the Old and New Testament.' But he has become a 
candidate battling a political Catch-22. A man who says what he 
means and means what he says and now must fight the embrace of 
people who think they know exactly what he is talking about." CBS 
News spokeswoman Kim Apgar told MediaWatch "I can't speak to this. 
You need McNamara." But CBS could not locate a number where 
McNamara could be reached. 
<P>
While CBS attempted to connect Buchanan with neo-Nazis and the KKK, 
they have been critical of any look at the associations of Bill 
Clinton. In October 1992, The Washington Times and others 
investigated Clinton's role in the anti-Vietnam war movement. 
Father Richard McSorley's book Peace Eyes recounts Clinton's role 
as an organizer of a protest service that ended in a march to the 
U.S. embassy with white crosses, left "as an indication of our 
desire to end the agony of Vietnam." McSorley reported the 
protest's organizers were "Group 68 (Americans in Britain)," which 
"had the support" of the British Peace Council, a Soviet front 
group.  
<P>
After Clinton's anti-war involvement came up in the first 
presidential debate, CBS This Morning co-host Harry Smith declared 
on October 12: "Clearly, that red-baiting junk didn't work last 
night." The networks aired no stories questioning "the company 
Clinton keeps" or suggesting "It's not that Clinton has signaled 
through acts or statements his support for the Soviet Union, but 
that he created an image of someone who might be sympathetic to 
such acts or statements." They called it a smear. Guilt by 
association is clearly a game reporters play on only one side.

<H3>Jack White, Smear Artist.</H3>
<P>
In an attack uglier than any of this year's attack ads, Time
national correspondent Jack E. White announced the culprits behind
black church burnings in the South. After blaming Pat Buchanan's
"ugly rhetoric" in the March 18 issue, he broadened the smear: "In
fact, all the conservative Republicans, from Newt Gingrich to Pete
Wilson, who have sought political advantage by exploiting white
resentment should come and stand in the charred ruins of the New
Liberty Baptist Church in Tyler [Alabama]...and wonder if their
coded phrases encouraged the arsonists. Over the past 18 months,
while Republicans fulminated about welfare and affirmative action,
more than 20 churches in Alabama and six other Southern and Border
states have been torched."
<P>
White noted the current lack of evidence of a racist conspiracy in
the bombings, yet concluded: "But there is already enough evidence
to indict the cynical conservatives who build their political
careers, George Wallace-style, on a foundation of race-baiting.
They may not start fires, but they fan the flames." 
<P>
<a name=rooting>
<H3>Rooting Against Rush.</H3>
<P>
Tom Brokaw may have engaged in wishful thinking on the February 14
Nightly News when he devoted the "NBC News Online" to the alleged
fall of Rush Limbaugh. Brokaw claimed "Election results are one way
to tell who's hot in politics. Then there are the ratings in this
business." Brokaw charged that Limbaugh's "radio and television
ratings have tumbled, and his books, once huge best-sellers, now
are in the discount bins." He added a plug for the book Rush
Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot by Al Franken, a fellow NBC employee:
"And a book about Limbaugh, by the comedian Al Franken, is riding
high, it's number two behind Hillary Clinton's book and rising
fast."
<P>
But as Talkers magazine Editor Michael Harrison noted in the March
3 Washington Times, Limbaugh's ratings "dropped a marginal,
insignificant amount" in the fall. "The guy belches in ratings, and
everyone runs around as if the witch is dead," Harrison said. He
noted Limbaugh is on 650 radio stations, with a total audience more
than double his closest political talk show competition. 
<P>
Linda Cecere of the Rush Limbaugh television show told MediaWatch
there are 8.9 million copies of Limbaugh's two books currently in
print, and noted the books have spent a total of 114 weeks on the
New York Times bestseller list (hardcover and paperback). His first
book spent 24 weeks at the #1 spot. Brokaw ignored how virtually
all bestsellers with a big press run are eventually discounted.
<P>
<a name=friends>
<H3>With Friends Like These.... </H3>
<P>
During the usually contentious primary season the media focused on
Republican rifts, but ignored Democratic divisions over their party
leader. With two exceptions the networks failed to report attacks
on President Clinton from two prominent Democrats. In an interview
with Washington Post reporter Martha Sherrill in the January issue
of Esquire magazine Senator Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) insisted:
"Clinton's an unusually good liar." Kerrey's extraordinary
admission received very little coverage. Tim Russert, prompted by
a Washington Times article, asked Colorado Gov. Roy Romer about the
Kerrey quote on the February 4 Meet the Press.
<P>
CNN's Bernard Shaw briefly mentioned the quote on the February 6
Inside Politics, and added the remarks of Sen. Ernest Hollings
(D-S.C.) who joked of Clinton's poll ratings: "If they get up to 60
percent, his people tell me Bill can start dating again." Shaw also
relayed a Hollings quote from a South Carolina paper: "Clinton's as
popular as AIDS in South Carolina." The Hollings quotes received no
coverage in the usually AIDS-sensitive television networks of ABC,
NBC and CBS. By contrast, in December 1994 when Senator Jesse Helms
(R-N.C.) joked that Clinton was so unpopular that he had better
bring bodyguards if he visited any military bases, the Helms remark
generated nine stories on the three broadcast network evening news
shows.
<P>

<H3>Our Sweet Little Terrorist Helper</H3>
<P>
In the weeks following the Oklahoma City bombing, the news media
were quick to portray suspect Timothy McVeigh unsympathetically as
a violent extremist, as well they should. But when 26-year-old Lori
Berenson was sentenced to life in prison by a Peruvian military
tribunal for being closely involved with the Marxist terrorists of
the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), the news media tried
to portray her sympathetically as a concerned American who went to
Latin America to work for the poor. 
<P>
Although she admitted to being affiliated with the MRTA, the
January 22 Time didn't feel that was important: "Her friends and
relatives know Lori Berenson as a compassionate idealist, an
innocent waylaid by her concern for the poor and oppressed of Latin
America." Time concluded: "But Berenson's real passion was always
to help the downtrodden; as a teenager she donated time to a soup
kitchen." A February 4 Washington Post headline read: "Little Girl
Lost. American Lori Berenson, 26, Was a Good Daughter, A Good
Worker, a Good-Hearted Person. In Peru, She Got Into Trouble. Bad
Trouble." On February 21, ABC Prime Time Live reporter John
Quinones used the same approach in a story titled "To Love A
Country": "In the 8th grade, Lori volunteered to work at a soup
kitchen. Later that year she was selected to narrate a commercial
for CARE, an appeal to feed needy children."
<P>
This theme was countered by a Mark Falcoff article in the February
26 issue of The Weekly Standard: "But let the record show that she
is charged not for her views, but for her involvement with a
terrorist group that, in recent years, has been involved in
assassinations, bombings, kidnappings, robberies, and attacks
against innocent people, many of them poor."
<P>
<a name=absentees>
<H3>Ethics Absentees</H3>
<P>
The networks continue to ignore ethics complaints against
Democratic leaders of the House of Representatives. In early
February, the networks saw no need for a story when Rep. Jennifer
Dunn (R-Wash.) filed a complaint with the House ethics committee
suggesting House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt may have evaded
capital gains taxes on a land swap.  
<P>
The February 23 Washington Times reported that Gephardt dumped his
share of ownership of the vacation home on North Carolina's Outer
Banks. George Archibald wrote that Gephardt, who is an avid
opponent of capital gains tax cuts, "claimed for
financial-disclosure purposes that his condo was not a rental
property the year he sold it for $183,000. He simultaneously
claimed it as a rental property for tax purposes to escape capital
gains taxes of about $17,000 in 1991." Archibald struck again with
a March 6 piece in the Washington Times noting that Rep. Bob Barr
(R-Ga.) formally requested the Justice Department undertake a
criminal probe of Gephardt's tax situation. Neither story piqued
the networks' curiosity.
<P>
On March 6, the conservative Landmark Legal Foundation filed a
complaint against House MinorityWhip David Bonior, the ethical
scold of Speaker Newt Gingrich, for misusing his congressional
staff to write a 1984 book on government time. The networks didn't
cover that either.

"This morning we're taking a close look at the problem of child
care, a problem some countries are solving," co-host Harry Smith
announced on the February 21 CBS This Morning. The country with the
solution? France and its expensive, old-style socialist system. 
<P>
Smith marveled at the state-mandated benefits: "Like all new
mothers in France, Helene took a 16-week paid maternity leave from
her job. In addition, mothers who work for larger companies can
take off two more years unpaid, with the guarantee their jobs will
still be there when they get back." To support this system, Smith
admitted that taxes are "much higher in France than in the United
States...and that may be why they're going through some of their
own economic problems." But, incredibly, he also referred to the
system as free: "When Jeanne leaves day care, she can attend a
completely free, good quality, state-run pre-school where she stays
until she is six and primary school begins."  Smith followed the
segment with an interview of Ellen Galinsky of the liberal Families
and Work Institute. His first question was more accusation: "In the
United States, are we just not willing to pay for child care?"
<P>

<H3>ABC vs. the First Amendment</H3>
<P>
A special interest group wants to use the coercive power of the
government to silence the opposition. ABC News naturally comes down
on the side of free speech, right? Not quite. Here's how Peter
Jennings introduced a February 14 World News Tonight story:
"Supporters of gun control, who had no success convincing a
Republican Congress to pass stronger gun control legislation, have
adopted a new tactic. They have asked the Federal Trade Commission
to stop certain advertisements by gun manufacturers."
<P>
Lisa Stark explained that the ads "sell safety and security,
offering guns as a way to protect loved ones, to guard home and
family. But critics say this picture is deceptive and misleading."
After a soundbite from Sarah Brady, Stark elaborated: "Gun control
advocates point to tragedies you won't find in the ads. In Texas,
a teenager shot and killed, mistaken for a burglar by her father;
in California, a four-year-old shoots himself," and a 15-year-old
"killed by his best friend." 
<P>
Stark asserted that "scientific studies show handguns are more
likely to hurt family members than protect them." ABC aired three
soundbites from opponents of the gun ads, but only one from Tanya
Metaksa of the National Rifle Association. Metaksa was only allowed
to defend the right to air ads, not to counter the liberal
statistics about gun accidents. If Stark had any interest in
balance, she could have noted that Dr. Arthur Kellerman, a fervent
gun control advocate, explained in the August 14, 1994 U.S. News &
World Report that "Studies such as ours do not include cases in
which intruders are wounded or frightened away by the use or
display of a firearm." Last year in his book Guns, David Kopel
noted that bicycle and swimming pool accidents kill more children
annually than do guns. If ABC wants the FTC to regulate
advertisements from weapon manufacturers, then who will regulate
the network's own gun control ads disguised as journalism?
<P>
<a name=episcopal>
<H3>The Episcopalian Inquisition?</H3>
<P>
The word inquisition brings to mind torture sessions in dark
castles in medieval Europe where unbelievers were strapped to the
rack until they swore allegiance to the church. Recently, the
networks used the word to describe whether the Episcopal Church
should allow a practicing homosexual minister to lead church
services.
<P>
Peter Jennings led off the rhetorical overkill about Bishop Walter
Righter on the February 27 World News Tonight: "This next story in
the news tonight may conjure the Spanish Inquisition for some but
the dateline is Wilmington, Delaware. A retired bishop could become
the second Episcopal priest in the two hundred year history of the
U.S. Episcopal Church to be tried for heresy, the most serious
breach of Christian faith. His offense: ordaining a practicing
homosexual five years ago."
<P>
On the same night's CBS Evening News, reporter Richard Threlkeld
referred to the trial as something "right out of the middle ages"
and stated that "critics charge Bishop Righter's the victim of a
conservative inquisition." The idea that conservative bishops
inside the Episcopal Church wanted to enforce church doctrine left
Threlkeld scratching his head: "It's ironic that something so
medieval should be happening within the Episcopal Church, one of
the more tolerant of Protestant denominations."

<H3>Networks Ignore Clinton Ally's Coalition-Building with Louis Farrakhan<BR>
--Reserving Rebukes for Buchanan</H3>
<P>
When the liberal Center for Public Integrity released a report
February 15 showing Larry Pratt, co-chairman of the Pat Buchanan
campaign, had attended and spoken before meetings of white
supremacists and anti-semites, it led all the network evening
newscasts. Some made Buchanan guilty by association. "Pat Buchanan
was caught today in his own crossfire with accusations that he is
running a campaign of hate and bigotry," declared Phil Jones on
CBS. 
<P>
But five days later, when Bill Clinton and Al Gore attended the
swearing in of Kweisi Mfume as President of the NAACP, the networks
refused to make an issue of Mfume's links to the Nation of Islam's
Louis Farrakhan. The four network evening shows didn't even mention
the event.
<P>
As New York Post editorial page editor Eric Breindel pointed out
February 29, Mfume "helped forge the 1993 `Sacred Covenant' between
the Congressional Black Caucus, which Mfume chaired, and Louis
Farrakhan's Nation of Islam." Surely, asked Breindel, "the
fringe-right groups with which Larry Pratt associates are no more
pernicious than the Farrakhanites." 
<P>
Pratt, head of Gun Owners of America, immediately took a leave of
absence from the Buchanan campaign. "Mfume, by contrast," Breindel
noted, "hasn't manifested any inclination to distance himself from
Farrakhan....the ex-Congressman hasn't even been asked to do so."
Not even after Farrakhan praised the leaders of Libya, Iraq and
Iran during a world trip. Farrakhan accepted a $1 billion pledge
from Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi for his separatist
organization to "mobilize `oppressed' minorities to influence this
year's U.S. elections," The Washington Post reported February 17,
three days before Clinton stood beside Mfume.  
<P>
Back in the U.S., Farrakhan offered some fresh anti-semitism. In a
clip shown February 29 on Rush Limbaugh, he said: "When you bring
me before Congress, I'm going to call the roll of all the
Congressmen who are honorary members of the Israeli Knesset and get
contributions from the Zionist AIPAC, and then I want you to
register as a foreign power! Every year you give Israel $46 billion
of the taxpayers' money and you haven't asked the taxpayers one
damn thing. Who are you an agent of?"
<P>
Did reporters demand Clinton explain his support of Farrakhan
backer Mfume? No, they were too busy tarnishing Buchanan. In a
February 23 NBC Nightly News piece, Gwen Ifill proffered to
Buchanan: "People say that you are a sexist, a racist, an
anti-semite." Ifill concluded that "Buchanan fancies himself a
trench-fight-er, a warrior for a new conservatism of the heart. But
increasingly he's being judged by the company he keeps." That's not
a judgment reporters made of Clinton.

<H3>Poor, Poor OSHA</H3>
<P>
The Congress may have failed so far to pass a regulatory reform
bill, but The Washington Post is warning of the consequences of
"deregulation" nonetheless. In a four-part February 18-21 series
titled "De Facto Deregulation," Post reporters didn't so much
describe "deregulation" as they did the frustration of regulators
and their political allies at their inability to implement
additional rules.
<P>
In the first story, reporter Cindy Skrzycki did feature opinions
from the "libertarian" Cato Institute and the "conservative"
National Center for Public Policy Research, but leftist Ralph Nader
was simply a "consumer activist." Despite their prominence in  the
series, liberal groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council
(NRDC) were not described as liberal.
<P>
Stephen Barr's story on the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) read like a bureaucrat's newsletter,
beginning with the headline "Cuts Frustrate OSHA Plans to Improve
Worker Safety." Barr mourned the agency's 15 percent budget
reduction and trotted out the OSHA line that it has far too few
inspectors to enforce its regulations in every business across the
nation. Barr passed on OSHA complaints that it hasn't enough money
for its office redesign plans and computer networking operations.
Barr added that its employees "likely will lose part of their
salaries through unpaid furlough days....The possibility of layoffs
has flattened morale at OSHA and left many OSHA employees feeling
anxious about their futures." 
<P>
Barr didn't address the philosophical point of new congressional
oversight -- that for decades, regulatory agencies had no check or
balance in the legislative branch -- or the obvious counterpoint
that OSHA's actions have often caused economic frustrations and
anxieties to businesses.
<P>
In the last article of the series, reporter Gary Lee mourned the
failure to implement new revisions from the 1990 Clean Air Act
reauthorization. As David Hawkins of the NRDC complained in the
series' last paragraph: "We'll never be able to get clean air in
areas like [Baltimore or Houston] without stricter enforcement of
the act." Apparently to the Post, "deregulation" doesn't mean the
repeal of regulations, but merely slowing down the juggernaut of
ever-increasing government interference.

<H3>CBS Spikes Goldberg for His Honesty--Blew the Wrong Whistle</H3>
<P>
What a difference the message makes. After 60 Minutes last fall
spiked part of an interview with Jeffrey Wigand, the ex-Brown &
Williamson cigarette company executive, CBS reporters were angry
and embarrassed that Wigand's confidentiality pledge prevented him
from blowing the whistle on his former employer. On February 4, CBS
overcame the legal hurdle and aired the spiked charges about
manipulated nicotine levels. On PBS's Charlie Rose February 6 Dan
Rather said that story "was gutsy, great reporting."
<P>
Fast forward a week and CBS correspondent Bernard Goldberg blew the
whistle on CBS, detailing in a February 13 Wall Street Journal
op-ed how colleague Eric Engberg's story on the flat tax "set new
standards for bias." Goldberg explained that "The old argument that
the networks and other `media elites' have a liberal bias is so
blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore."
<P>
So did journalists trumpet this whistle-blower? Hardly. "It's such
a wacky charge....I don't know what Bernie was driving at. It just
sounds bizarre," Face the Nation's Bob Schieffer told The
Washington Post. "To accuse Eric of liberal bias is absurd,"
sniffed CBS News President Andrew Heyward. "The test is not the
names people call you or accusations by political activists inside
or outside your own organization," Rather told the New York Post in
an insult to Goldberg's professionalism, insisting "I am not going
to be cowed by anybody's special political agenda."
<P>
USA Today's Peter Johnson reported March 11: "Some colleagues
supported him privately. But many others stopped talking to him,
dismissing him as dead wrong, an ingrate, a nut or all of the
above. Mostly, the big chill set in. Not-so-coincidentally, none of
his commentary segments on the News, `Bernard Goldberg's America,'
has aired since the day his piece came out."
<P>
Johnson concluded that CBS has decided to bully the messenger:
"Goldberg has spent the past month lying low, hoping animus toward
him would die down. It hasn't, and all signs around CBS News are
that it will continue until Goldberg shows interest in eating a
healthy serving of humble pie." 
<P>
The March 13 New York Post reported that Goldberg apologized to
Engberg and is sorry if he "hurt anyone's feelings." But Goldberg
felt he had to go public since, as he explained to the Post's Josef
Adalian, he "tried for years and years to discuss this issue," but
was "met with varying degrees of `Who cares?'"

Two network veterans have joined the effort to re-elect President 
Clinton. In the Clinton-Gore campaign office, Roll Call reported that 
Joseph Lockhart, who bounces between Democratic presidential campaigns 
and network slots, has bounced again, this time into the national press 
secretary slot. Lockhart was an assistant press secretary to Democratic 
candidate Walter Mondale in 1984, then Press Secretary to Senator Paul 
Simon until becoming assignment editor for ABC News in Chicago in 1985. 
He put in a stint as a deputy assignment editor at CNN before joining 
the 1988 Dukakis-Bentsen campaign as a traveling press aide.
Stuart Schear, the off-air health and science reporter until last year 
for the MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour, has joined the White House press office 
as coordinator of local and national TV interviews with the President, 
The Washington Post reported. For the July/August 1995 Mother Jones, 
Schear wrote "a consumer guide to the health insurer's new, overheated 
advertising campaigns."

ABC and Fox have chosen political operatives to head their future 
all-news cable channels. ABC News President Roone Arledge went left, 
hiring back former ABC News executive Jeff Gralnick from NBC News where 
he's been Executive Producer of the NBC Nightly News since 1993. In 1971 
Gralnick served as Press Secretary to liberal Senator George McGovern 
(D-S.D.). After promoting the future presidential candidate, Gralnick 
jumped to ABC, where by 1979 he had risen to Executive Producer of World 
News Tonight. He oversaw all election coverage for ABC since 1980, 
becoming Vice President and Executive Producer of special events in 
1985.
<P>
Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch went to the right, naming Roger Ailes, 
President of CNBC since 1993, as the chief executive of the Fox All News 
Network as well as of the Fox broadcast news operation. While  producer 
of the Mike Douglas Show in the 1960s, Ailes met Richard Nixon and left 
the show to become media adviser to the 1968 Republican candidate's 
successful run. He spent the next two decades devising media and ad 
strategies for GOP candidates, including Ronald Reagan and George Bush. 
In 1992 he took the helm of the Rush Limbaugh TV show as its Executive 
Producer.

Six media veterans are making out pretty well at the White House, a June 
26, 1995 payroll report shows. The March 1 Washington Times ran the list 
of salaries of 407 White House staffers released by the Senate 
Appropriations Committee's subcommittee on the Treasury, Postal Service 
and general government.
<P>
The list shows that speechwriting head Donald Baer, a former U.S. News 
Assistant Managing Editor, earns $125,000 a year. Wall Street Journal 
and Time reporter turned speechwriter Daniel Benjamin gets $80,000, as 
do speechwriters Carolyn Curiel, a former Nightline producer, and Alison 
Muscatine, a former Washington Post reporter who also helped write First 
Lady Hillary Clinton's book It Takes a Village. Deputy Press Secretary 
Virginia Terzano, a CBS News election unit researcher in 1988, pulls 
down $66,000. At the bottom end lies Anne Edwards at $50,000, a former 
CBS News assignment editor and Senior Editor for NPR who now runs the

Lard on the Labels, Investigate Finances, and Charge Bigotry<BR>
-- Clinton Thought He Had It Tough...</H2>

Reporters don't like ideological labeling, at least when it's
applied to them. Last November, Dan Rather told Denver radio host
Mike Rosen he hated "to be tagged by someone else's label. I try
really hard not to do that with other people, particularly people
who are in public service and politics."
<P>
So do reporters use labeling in campaign coverage? MediaWatch
analysts compared media coverage of the primaries in 1992 with
those in 1996. Analysts reviewed evening news coverage of the four
networks (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly
News, and CNN's The World Today and in 1992 World News or Prime
News) for 19 days, starting with the Tuesday before the New
Hampshire primary.
<P>
For 1992, the days studied were February 11-29; in 1996, February
13-March 2, the day of the South Carolina primary. Both were 
periods when voters and reporters winnowed down the presidential
field.
<P>
The study found the Democratic candidates or their supporters were
labeled "liberal" only four times, none suggesting extremism. In
1996, GOP candidates or their supporters were labeled 73 times, 45
of the labels suggesting extremism. Analysts also looked at
campaign controveries. Five stories investigated the finances of
Republicans, compared to no investigations of the Democrats.
Charges of bigotry by  Pat Buchanan were featured in 20 stories.  
<P>
<a name=labels>
<H3>Labels.</H3>
<P>
Reporters used only four liberal labels to describe the Democratic
candidates, all in the first two days of the 1992 study period. On
February 11, NBC's Andrea Mitchell used two labels, calling Tom
Harkin "a pure liberal and proud of it" with "old-fashioned liberal
solutions." That same night, ABC's Judy Muller noted: "If Kerrey's
health plan strikes some voters as too liberal, his more
conservative proposals for dealing with the recession seem to
strike a chord with voters trying to make ends meet." The next
night, Muller said Harkin calls himself "an unabashed liberal." 
<P>
Even when the ideology seemed obvious, reporters stressed
candidates were not liberal, but part of the mainstream. On
February 12, 1992, ABC reporter Chris Bury reported on Jerry Brown:
"To those who hear him, Brown's appeal is his idealism, his calls
for political reform, universal health care, and environmental
activism." Despite that left-wing agenda, Bury underlined: "Some
voters seemed surprised Brown did not sound so radical." The
closest thing to a Clinton label came from ABC's Jack Smith, who
told viewers a week later that Clinton's economic message "runs
counter to so much traditional liberal ideology." (Did reporters
eschew labeling in 1992? No. Stories during the study period on the
1992 GOP race used the word "conservative" or "from the right" on
77 occasions, with four references to extremism.) 
<P>
In 1996, Republicans and their voters were labeled on 73 occasions.
The networks employed 18 conservative descriptions, six moderate
labels, and even four liberal tags (all of them from  reporters
quoting Buchanan's attacks on his rivals). On the 18th, NBC's David
Bloom said Lamar Alexander was "trying to bolster his conservative
credentials." But extreme terms were applied on 45 occasions -- all
but one to describe Pat Buchanan. (The exception: Bloom called 
Alexander a "moderate Republican with a radical plan of
devolution.") Among references to extremism, 36 used the terms
"extreme" or "extremist," but analysts included the terms
"ultraconservative," "too conservative" or "out of the mainstream."
<P>
CBS led the networks with 19 references to Buchanan's extremism
(compared to 12 for CNN, nine for ABC, and five by NBC). On six
occasions, CBS underlined their perception of Buchanan's
ultraconservatism by referring to the networks' Voter News Service
exit poll question asking if Buchanan was too extreme. In a
February 18 interview with Sen. Phil Gramm, Dan Rather asked:
"There is a perception that Buchanan has around him people with
extremist views on race. Do you agree?" On February 25, CBS weekend
anchor John Roberts asked CBS consultant Joe Klein: "Some call
Buchanan an extremist. Others call him as American as apple pie.
What is this fellow's appeal?" Klein replied: "He is both. He is an
extremist and as American as apple pie." 
<P>
<a name=finances>
<H3>Finances.</H3>
<P>
Reporters were not interested in the Democratic candidates'
finances in 1992, airing no stories during the study period. When
Whitewater first came to light on March 8, 1992, NBC aired only one
story, eight days later. CBS made a brief mention on the 8th, and
then dismissed financial questions on the 16th. Reporter Richard
Threlkeld portrayed Whitewater questions as an invasion of Hillary
Clinton's privacy.  All together, the networks did just five full
stories on the Clinton finances in 1992.
<P>
In 1996, CBS and NBC combined for five stories in just 19 days
touching on Republican candidate finances. NBC investigated the
sweetheart deals of Lamar Alexander on February 13, and mentioned
them again February 18. CBS investigated the Alexander deals on
February 15, then added another look at Honey Alexander's and
Elizabeth Dole's financial moves on February 17. On March 2, CBS
suggested hypocrisy in Buchanan's stock ownership of Fortune 500
corporations. On February 21, CBS reporter Rita Braver claimed
Lamar Alexander had "some financial dealings in his past that might
put Whitewater to shame."
<P>
<a name=bigotry>
<H3>Bigotry?</H3>
<P>
Sparked by the disclosure that Buchanan campaign co-chair Larry
Pratt spoke at forums shared by white supremacists, the networks
aired twenty stories raising the allegation that Buchanan was
bigoted against blacks or Jews. CBS reporter Phil Jones concluded:
"Buchanan has been talking and writing like this for years. Then,
he was on the fringe. Now, he's on the front line and Americans are
starting to take a closer look at Pat Buchanan's America." The
story count didn't include isolated soundbites, like one voter on
the March 2 CBS Evening News: "Buchanan scares me. He reminds me of
a little guy over in Germany with a mustache." 
<P>
In September 1992, Bill Clinton claimed: "Nobody's had a tougher
press than I have. No candidate in history has." Some of this
year's candidates may beg to differ.

<Center><h2>
Bright Side for April 1996 Mediawatch
</h2></center>


<b>Detecting Deception</b><br>

CNN's Brooks Jackson was first out of the gate to critique the presidential candidates in their ads and speeches. On the April 1 Inside Politics he critiqued Republican charges that Clinton judges were soft on crime. But in a surprising turn Jackson has also slammed Clinton's newest set of ads. His April 4 "Spin Patrol" segment challenged each claim made in the Democratic National Committee ads.
<p>
CNN aired the ad: "The President proposes a balanced budget protecting Medicare, education, the environment. But Dole is voting no. The President cuts taxes for 40 million Americans. Dole votes no." 
<p>
Jackson replied: "Dole voting no to a balanced budget and tax cuts? Let's see that again...True, Clinton's latest budget would balance in 7 years on paper, but experts are skeptical." Jackson used moderate-to-liberal Carol Cox Wait of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and Robert Reischauer of the Brookings Institution.
<p>
Jackson found the ad's claim "The President cuts taxes for 40 million Americans" was "Not the whole story." He pointed out that the Clinton administration arrived at the 40 million number through the 1993 budget bill's expansion of the earned income tax credit to "15 million low wage families, 40 million if you count their children." Jackson countered they also raised taxes on 1.5 million high-income families and 5 million Social Security recipients, not to mention higher gas taxes for everyone.
<p>
Another ad claimed Republicans cut school lunches. Jackson: "Not so. The Republican Congress appropriated more money for school lunches this year....And the Agriculture Department says it has increased the number of children served." 
<p>
The same ad charged the GOP cut Head Start: "Money for the Head Start pre-school program has been cut four percent this year, temporarily. But Republican leaders have agreed to a one percent increase once a permanent appropriations bill is passed. Meanwhile not a single child has been affected. In fact Head Start enrollment is up this year."  
<p>
And the DNC's claim that Republicans "cut child health care" did not go unchallenged. Jackson explained that Republicans only reduced the rate of Medicaid growth and that there is not much difference between the GOP and Clinton's proposal.

<title>Janet Cooke Award April 1996</title>

<center><h2>
Janet Cooke Award for the April 1996 Mediawatch. 
</h2></center>

<i>The Janet Cooke Award is given to the most outrageously distorted news story of the month. The award honors the Washington Post reporter who won the Pulitzer Prize for a story later proven completely false.</i>
<p>

<b>
CBS, NBC Suggest "Extremist" Bishop Guilty of "Witch Hunt" for Upholding Church Teaching.
</b><br>
In the sophisticated ambiance of TV newsrooms, freedom of association is a concept apparently as outmoded as traditional religion. The notion that in America, a church is a voluntary association, bound together by commonly held theological beliefs, is a strange and alien argument. For holding up a Catholic bishop as a symbol of "extremism" enforcing a "blacklist," CBS and NBC earned the Janet Cooke Award. 
<p>
On the March 25 CBS Evening News, Dan Rather began: "In Lincoln, Nebraska, a bishop is taking the Catholic Church's battle over personal morality a step further. He is threatening to excommunicate any parishioner who joins groups advocating positions the church opposes. That threat puts this bishop in the forefront of a national furor, as we hear from Scott Pelley."
<p>
Pelley began: "Critics call him an extremist, a danger to the Catholic Church. What has thrust national notoriety upon Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz is a list, his own blacklist of organizations, he says, threaten the mortal soul...Bruskewitz has decreed that parishioners in his diocese of southern Nebraska have seven weeks to resign memberships in the listed groups, or be excommunicated, severing, the bishop says, their relationship with God."
<p>
He added: "The list includes pro-choice Planned Parenthood and the Hemlock Society, which advocates a right to die. But it also includes some organizations that consider themselves to be Catholic, even though they stray from Vatican teaching. One of them, known as Call to Action, advocates the ordination of women."
<p>
Call to Action's Robert McClory claimed: "The organization was founded to promote dialogue on issues, about which Catholics are seriously divided. He would prefer, evidently, that there be no discussion, and he's ordered those people, who think so, to simply get out of his house." Pelley noted: "The Bruskewitz list may be unique in America. Bishops rule their own diocese; parishioners are welcome to appeal to the Pope. Randall Moody faces excommunication. He is a parishioner and a member of Planned Parenthood's [national] board of directors." Moody oozed: "The organizations affected by this excommunication order are mainstream America, and it paints the church into the corner of being an extremist organization."
<p>
Pelley allowed Bruskewitz to speak: "These groups mislead people into thinking that they're compatible with the Catholic religion when they're not....It's not a question of not wanting to discuss issues. It's a question of an organization, which is, by its very constitution, inimical to the Catholic faith, which is destructive of church discipline."
<p>
Pelley ended: "The controversy is an example of tension in the American church, with a conservative Vatican on one side and reform-minded Catholics on the other. Now in Nebraska, there is a deadline for those who must decide whether they live their conscience or keep their faith."
<p>
NBC Nightly News had a similar take on April 1. While the on-screen graphic read "Blacklisted," Tom Brokaw pronounced: "A controversy is splitting apart a church as it prepares to enter its holiest week. At issue: A threat by a Catholic bishop in Nebraska to expel members from the church, for reasons his critics say belong in another era. Here's NBC's Linda Vester."
<p>
Vester began: "Last night in Lincoln, more than 60 Catholics gathered to figure out how to avoid being kicked out of their church...They're angry with the bishop of Lincoln for threatening them with the ultimate punishment: excommunication. Their crime: belonging to any of twelve groups the bishop has blacklisted, including Planned Parenthood, the Freemasons, and Call to Action, a nationwide organization that advocates women priests, married priests, and birth control."
<p>
Bruskewitz said: "Membership in these organizations that are listed certainly imperils the Catholic faith." Vester countered: "But a blanket order of excommunication, for any reason, is rare, unheard of in modern times. Some members of Call to Action, like Rosalyn Carr, are afraid and are quitting the group." Carr charged: "Well, I think the bishop has ways to retaliate."
<p>
Vester added: "But at Call to Action's meeting last night, others were defiant. Those who defy the bishop's order will be excommunicated May 15, which means they can attend mass, but they can't take communion or get  married in the church. The bishop says he won't enforce the order; he expects people to police themselves....But the bishop is getting help. The pro-life group, Rescue America, is going to give him members' names from the local Planned Parenthood."
<p>
Vester asked: "Is it a witch hunt? One theologian thinks it may turn people away from a church already struggling with its image." Father Richard McBride of the University of Notre Dame exclaimed: "It reinforces the prejudice that a lot of people have that it really is a new, a modern form of authoritarianism."
<p>
Vester wrapped it up: "Despite what critics say, Bishop Bruskewitz insists his order stands." Bruskewitz said: "Oh, I have no intentions of waffling." Vester's conclusion was almost identical to Pelley's: "Which leaves some Catholics here feeling forced to choose between their conscience and their church." When contacted by MediaWatch, both reporters were said to be on assignment. Despite numerous calls and faxes, neither responded.
<p>
William Donohue, President of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, told MediaWatch the networks are guilty of "rank hypocrisy" in their coverage of freedom of association: "The American Civil Liberties Union has a policy that every officer is pro-choice. If an officer were to evolve into a pro-life position, he would become a pariah, like Nat Hentoff, who was thrown off the board of directors. That's their prerogative. But where's the charge of authoritarianism?"
<p>
Donohue said the same is true for reporters: "I asked a newspaper reporter: what if one of your colleagues went on the local TV station and denounced your newspaper? If a secular organization won't tolerate that kind of insubordination, why is the Church held to a different standard?" This is especially pertinent in the case of CBS News after reporter Bernard Goldberg was kept off the air for months after he denounced the liberal bias of his own network. A CBS statement said Rather "disagrees with Mr. Goldberg's opinion...and its expression." 
<p>
Perhaps the networks' blind spot is unique to religion, where they imply that dissent is noble and church doctrine autocratic, that theology is subject to a vote and salvation is accomplished by focus group. CBS and NBC had three possible ways to present its story: Bruskewitz as hero for standing up for tradition, Bruskewitz as author-itarian villain, or a balanced presentation of both views. Instead of pursuing the professional third option, they opted for the bishop as villain.

<title>Newsbites for April 1996</title></head>

<center><h2>
Newsbites for the April 1996 Mediawatch
</h2></center>
<p>

<b>First Pitch Glitch</b><br>

NBC's Tom Brokaw swung and missed when he tried to cover for the President. During the traditional first pitch thrown by the President on baseball's Opening Day, Bill Clinton was roundly booed by many in attendance at the April 2 Orioles game. Brokaw delivered the play-by-play:
<p>
"President Clinton taking the mound for the ceremonial first pitch. All the way from the pitcher's rubber, it was a little on the high side, and watching from the stands and not booing like most of the rest of the crowd -- Pat Buchanan. By the way the boos, like the first pitch, are traditional whoever the President.
<p>
Dan Rather didn't even mention the boos on the same night's CBS Evening News. Viewers only heard cheering at Clinton's lob. But on that day's CNN Inside Politics Bruce Morton replayed five recent Opening Day first pitches, one from Ronald Reagan, three from George Bush, and a previous Clinton throw. In all five, including Clinton's earlier pitch, the President was cheered.
<p>

<b>The Nadir of Coverage</b><br>

GOP presidential candidates like Pat Buchanan and Phil Gramm were not only labeled as conservative but as "hard right," "extreme," and "hard-line." Then it would only make sense that someone to the left of Bill Clinton would be considered, at the very least, a liberal. But in the midst of Ralph Nader's campaign for President on the Green Party ballot, reporters referred to the outspoken leftist as not "hard left" or "far left" but as merely a "consumer advocate" or "consumer activist."
<p>
Since the media started paying attention to the Nader candidacy, reporters have failed to mention liberal in the same sentence as Nader. NBC's Gwen Ifill referred to him as "the consumer activist" on the March 24 Nightly News. On The World Today the same night, CNN's Martin Savidge reported: "Consumer advocate Ralph Nader says he'll be on California's presidential ballot this fall." In a search of Time, Newsweek, U.S. News & World Report, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and USA Today, only U.S. News mentioned the "L" word: the March 25 issue called Nader a "liberal alternative to Clinton." 
<p>

<b>What's "Risky and Radical"?</b><br> 

On the March 12 CBS Evening News, Dan Rather warned of coming Social Security reform proposals: "The stock market could play a big role in major changes in Social Security. A bipartisan commission is due out soon to officially propose some radical changes in the whole Social Security system that would include privatizing Social Security, allowing some of your Social Security contributions to be invested in the stock market. Now, this may or may not prove to be a good idea, but it could be risky business." 
<p>
CBS reporter Bob Schieffer, who also called the plan "radical change," stated on the March 26 CBS This Morning that "even more radical, [is] a plan favored by some commission members to allow taxpayers to invest, any way they want, almost half of what they now pay in Social Security taxes." How does the media's take on Social Security reform stack up against other large-scale changes proposed in Washington? 
<p>
Database searches reveal that not once did a network reporter refer to the Clinton health care plan as "radical." The plan Hillary Clinton and Ira Magaziner cooked up amounted to a government take-over of one-seventh of the economy. That's not radical -- but allowing people to invest their own retirement money is.

<p><b>
Cartooning Contrasts.
</b><br>
During this year's Lenten season, when Christians examine their faith and commitment to God, the Los Angeles Times decided to show its own hostility to religion. In the March 28 issue the paper ran an editorial cartoon with the image of Bob Dole crucified. The crown of thorns on his forehead read "Christian Coalition."
<p>
Three days later, the paper spiked Johnny Hart's Palm Sunday B.C. comic strip, featuring the character Wiley writing a poem honoring Christ's death for man's sins. Los Angeles Times spokeswoman Ariel Remler told The Washington Times that "lately he's [Hart] been running cartoons with religious overtones." Then in an April 2 statement quoted in The Washington Times, Remler announced that the paper would spike the strip on all three days of the Easter weekend. After receiving hundreds of protest calls, the paper reversed itself, announcing it would run the Friday and Saturday strips.
<p>
Two years ago, the Times played a similar game, spiking Hart's "inappropriate" Easter Sunday strip with a resurrection theme, but then ran in June a series of Garry Trudeau's Doonesbury strips featuring John Boswell's controversial claim that the Catholic Church sanctioned same-sex marriages in the middle ages.  
<p>
<b>
No Liberal Lobbies.
</b><br>
In March, the House of Representatives voted on repealing the assault weapons ban and outlawing partial-birth abortion. But the media found a narrow "lobby" on only one side of these issues. During the gun debate in late March, the networks employed the term "gun lobby" over six times on the morning and evening news to denote those who opposed the ban. Most happened on CBS, like the March 21 CBS Evening News piece where Bob Schieffer announced: "With Republicans knowing they lack the votes to override a veto and with little enthusiasm for any of this in the Senate, the House effort may turn out to be little more than a publicity stunt to impress the gun lobby."
<p>
In the liberal lexicon of Washington, an industry is termed a "lobby" when it pushes narrow interest for its own gain. But those who opposed the partial birth abortion ban were pushing a narrow, extreme interest to satisfy their own backers. Yet not once during the congressional wrangling over partial birth abortions did anyone on the networks use the term "abortion lobby." 
<p>
<b>
Gender Chasm!
</b><br>
Like they do every presidential election year, reporters are raising the so-called gender gap, claiming that Republicans have problems attracting women. On the March 25 NBC Nightly News, essayist Anne Taylor Fleming stated: "Polls show a huge gender gap brewing. Women, like these we gathered, are more upset than men by budget cuts and family issues that they feel are being ignored." So do Democrats have a problem attracting men? Yes, but this didn't interest ABC and NBC.
<p>
On Good Morning America Sunday March 24, ABC's Jack Smith recalled the budget fight: "Where men saw deficit reduction, women worried about what the cuts were doing." In the ensuing discussion, co-host Willow Bay asserted: "If you're still making 70 cents to that male dollar, you're probably more reluctant to see cuts in social spending -- your safety net."
<p>
While some attributed the gap to social spending, others cited the GOP's pro-life stance. NBC's Lisa Myers began her report on the March 5 Nightly News: "Republicans have a problem with women....And today, polls show women leaning even more heavily in favor of Democrats. The big reason: Pat Buchanan." Myers spoke to Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe and stated: "Snowe says even though Buchanan won't be the nominee, his polarizing anti-abortion rhetoric has done lasting damage." Myers concluded that Clinton's lead over Dole with women is "not a gender gap, [it's] a chasm."
<p>
If reporters believe the gap is due to abortion, they need to examine the polls. A May 1995 Tarrance Group poll found that 47 percent of women (compared to 44 percent of men) believe that abortion should be "illegal and prohibited under all circumstances" or "illegal except in cases such as rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother."
<p>
<b>
Green Gary
</b><br>
Guilt by association is still a handy media tool. The March 21 Washington Post headline read: "Industry Funds Global Warming Skeptics." Reporter Gary Lee began: "A Washington environmental group charged yesterday that three researchers who are outspoken critics of the scientific evidence for global warming have received hundreds of thousands of dollars from the petroleum and coal industries, and that this funding has influenced their views."
<p>
Lee described his source, Ozone Action, only as "an environmental group that lobbies on the issues of air quality and global climate change." Lee didn't use the word liberal or note they've even criticized Vice President Gore for being too soft on the environment. While Lee did call the researchers for comment, and quoted Patrick Michaels calling the charges "ludicrous," Lee excluded one obvious point: liberal environmental groups also take in hundreds of thousands of dollars from oil companies. The Capital Research Center noted that Exxon gave the National Audubon Society $112,500 in 1991 alone. The Post didn't do that man-pays-for-dog-to-bite-him story.
<p>

<b>Gannett Fires Like America.
</b><br>
The Gannett-owned Burlington [Vt.] Free Press fired Paul Teetor for reporting a story accurately, another victim of political correctness. But now he's been vindicated. In August 1993, Teetor angered black activists by reporting that a white woman was escorted from a community forum on racism after she tried to address it. A black city official, Rodney Patterson, told her the microphone they had set up for comments was for people "of color" only, not whites. After the story appeared, black activists demanded Teetor be fired for publishing an inaccurate story, even though a videotape confirmed Teetor's account. The Free Press canned him and ran a piece whitewashing Teetor's account of the meeting in accordance with the activists' demand.
<p>
Teetor filed a lawsuit against the paper. According to the March 29 Washington Post, the paper settled in his favor for an undisclosed sum. At trial, Teetor's lawyer alleged the real reason for the firing was the Gannett chain's "All-American Contest" where papers are evaluated and scored on how many minorities the paper hires and how positively minorities are depicted in news stories. Free Press editors were worried how the town meeting story would affect their scores because the contest results could be a factor in their own job promotions. 
<p>

<b>Fighting Forbes
</b><br>
The day before Steve Forbes ended his presidential bid, CBS reporter Phil Jones declared on the Evening News: "He struck fear in the hearts of his opponents by launching what may turn out to be the most massive, negative TV attack campaign in the history of American politics." Jones failed to mention the role CBS played in promoting negative politics. The network provided opponents with a free negative ad when it ran Eric Engberg's February 8 hit piece on the Forbes flat tax. Engberg referred to Forbes' "number one wackiest flat tax pro- mise." No wonder the Center for Media and Public Affairs found that with 87 percent derogatory comments, Engberg was the most negative reporter during the primaries.
<p>
<b>
Goldberg Survives, for Now. 
</b><br>

Speaking of Eric Engberg, CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg returned to the air April 9 with an Evening News "Eye on America" segment on rising youth crime caused by a deficit of values. Goldberg had been off the air since his February 13 Wall Street Journal op-ed arguing Engberg's story "set new standards for bias" and the liberal bias charge is "blatantly true."
<p>
The CBS Evening News had been airing "Bernard Goldberg's America," but CBS News President Andrew Heyward dumped the feature and has assigned him to the "Eye on America" beat. Goldberg's eight-week shunning and loss of his signature piece, however, may not be his only punishments. The Washington Post's John Carmody reported March 22: "Heyward would not comment on Goldberg's future when his contract expires at the end of the year." So much for promoting free speech.

Media Tied Talk Radio, Conservatives and Gingrich to Oklahoma City, But the Unabomber's On His Own
</b><br>
After the April 1995 Oklahoma City bombing the media hurled charges of complicity at conservatives. Referring to Newt Gingrich's language, Time declared that the "burden of fostering the delusion" that government is the enemy "is borne not just by the nut cases who preach conspiracy but also to some extent by those who erode faith in governance in the pursuit of their own ambitions." Asked Bob Schieffer on Face the Nation: "There's been a lot of anti-government rhetoric, it comes over talk radio...Do you think that that somehow has led these people to commit this act?" 
<p>
But this April, even after ABC detailed the Unabomber's left-wing ties, the rest of the media failed to pick up the theme.  
<P>
Two days after suspect Ted Kaczynski's April 3 arrest, Brian Ross reported on World News Tonight that his "name appeared...in connection with an FBI investigation of a radical environmental group called Earth First...Over the years, Earth First has been best known as a violent group spiking trees and blowing up logging equipment, and in many respects its anti-corporate philosophy parallels that of the Unabomber." 
<P>
Ross noted "that authorities believe Kaczynski was at a meeting attended by top Earth First members." A private investigator, Ross relayed, "says the bomb last year that killed the head of the California Forestry Association clearly can be tracked back to a hit list published in one radical environmental journal."
Instead of being consistent,  reporters buried the tie. On April 8 the environmental angle made it into the 35th paragraph of a USA Today story as well as the 15th paragraph in The New York Times that day and The Washington Post the next. Insisting "there is no proof," NBC's David Bloom dismissed the link April 10.
<P>
The Unabomber manifesto rails against capitalism (it begins "The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race"), but the April 15 Time noted no one recalled him having contact at Berkeley "with the leftists he would later excoriate in his manifesto." 
<P>
Some were sympathetic. USA Today's April 11 front page read: "UNABOMBER: A Hero to Some." Richard Price reported he's "being romanticized for his intellect" as "some people even feel sorry for him, seeing him a brilliant boy gone astray." On C-SPAN's Sunday Journal April 7, Time's Elaine Shannon found parts of the manifesto she agreed with, such as, "industrialization and pollution are all terrible things." She reasoned: "He wasn't a hypocrite, he lived as he wrote." Kaczynski "carried it to an extreme, and obviously murder is something that is far beyond any political philosophy, but he had a bike, he didn't have any plumbing."

Rotten in Denmark?
</b><br>
The media have often promoted liberal claims about the dangers of "overpopulation." Now that a new book, Our Stolen Future (with an introduction by Al Gore) theorizes that man-made chemicals are responsible for impending sterility, the media reaction is the same: unquestioned acceptance of ominous liberal claims. 
<P>
Time science writer Michael Lemonick wrote March 18 that "In study after study, sperm counts in men the world over seem to be dropping precipitously." He claimed the book contains "powerful evidence" to support the hypothesis that "reproduction-related ills may be caused by chemical pollutants in the environment, including DDT." The book is based on data from a Danish scientist, Niels Skakkebaek, whose meta-analysis of 61 sperm count studies found a 50 percent decline since 1938.
<P>
Though Lemonick wrote "the evidence for a chemical-infertility link does remain largely circumstantial," he warned of apocalypse: "Extrapolating from Skakkebaek's admittedly controversial data, it's conceivable that the average man will be infertile within a century. Even if things are only half that dire, it would be bad news indeed for the human race."
<P>
<i>Today's</i> Bryant Gumbel used the same tone with book cowriter Theo Colborn on March 12: "The extinction of the human race has long been a staple of science fiction, but according to a group of scientists, it could one day prove to be all too true, and they say the cause of the problem may be man-made chemicals." 
In a letter to Today, Dr. Glenn Swogger of the American Council on Science and Health claimed Colborn's "claims of lower sperm counts relates to a subsequently discredited study a number of years ago and is stale news in the scientific community...We run the risk of so limiting pesticide use through excessive regulation and discouragement of research that we will lose the valuable contribution they make to producing cheap and healthy fruits and vegetables." Gumbel only mentioned the ACSH to note they're "partially funded...by industry."
<P>
Robert Hager provided a more sober account on the April 1 NBC Nightly News, noting critics claimed the book was "bad science." Journalist Ronald Bailey was then allowed to critique the book's science in NBC's "In Their Own Words" segment.

<b>Bryant Gumbel, a Conservative? 
</b>
<br>
The March 21 Radio & TV Correspondents Dinner drew a lot of pressattention to the remarks of talk show host Don Imus, but the betterstory came from Marc Morano, Rush Limbaugh's man in D.C. He asked reporters in attendance about liberal bias, and the reporters only demonstrated their liberalism. 
<P>
Former CBS anchor Walter Cronkite admitted: "Everybody knows that there's a liberal, that there's a heavy liberal persuasion among correspondents." Cronkite argued, however, this is justified:"Anybody who has to live with the people, who covers police stations, covers county courts, brought up that way, has to have a degree of humanity that people who do not have that exposure don't have, and some people interpret that to be liberal. It's not a liberal, it's humanitarian and that's a vastly different thing."
<P>
When asked about the new Whitewater book, Blood Sport by JamesStewart, ABC's John Cochran felt the book was beneath him: "I haven't read it. I'm just now going through Elizabeth Drew's book,which is about the battle between the Gingrich Congress and theClinton White House and it's fascinating. It has nothing to do with gossip or Whitewater or what happened with Vince Foster or any ofthat, it has to do with what's happening with issues of importance to the American people." CBS's Bill Plante felt the issue was a waste of time: "The problem with the media coverage of Whitewater is that it has been done over and over and over again. I haven't read the book yet, but I understand that there's nothing basically new in it."
<P>
CNN's Judy Woodruff retorted to a query about Bernard Goldberg's comments about liberal bias: "I think Mr. Goldberg went a little bit too far...I don't think there's any blatant, rampant bias in the news media. If there were, then we wouldn't last in the jobs that we have." Most incredibly, Today weatherman Al Roker claimed:"I don't think there's a liberal bias in the media. Let me put it this way, I've never worked with a liberal anchorman, they're all very conservative." This from the man who shares a studio with Bryant Gumbel.

<b>Oklahoma Bill's Hate Radio</b><br>

After a year away to deal with heart trouble, Bill Moyers, a former Press Secretary to President Lyndon Johnson, returned to NBC on April 12 to host a Dateline NBC special "Oklahoma City: One Year Later." The day of the show, the New York Post quoted Moyers as insisting that he went to Oklahoma City "with nothing but a desire to find out what was happening. There was no agenda."
<P>
In reality, Moyers implied conservative rhetoric led to the bombing. But instead of having the integrity to name names or cite statements, Moyers offered an hour filled with vague generalities which held culpable "hate radio" and "the rhetoric of politics this season." Dateline featured this exchange with service station owner Bud Welch, whose daughter was killed:
<P>
Welch: "I thought, the first few months, that there was probably going to be more unity in the country, politically."
Moyers: "That this tragedy would bring us together?"
Welch: "Yes, that this tragedy would bring it together, but we're seeing through the elections that's going on right now, the same negative thoughts, the militia groups, the hate radio."
Moyers: "And you think that contributed to the tragedy, the bombing here?"
Welch: "Absolutely, without a doubt. Because it justifies a lot of the angry feelings that people have."
<P>
As Welch listened to G. Gordon Liddy on his car radio, Moyers charged: "The airwaves are still saturated with militant rhetoric. Day and night you can hear a stream of rage and insult directed with unremitting hostility at government and others. It rubs like salt in deep wounds and some of the families are trying to counter it."  
<P>
Then, as viewers saw several victims being interviewed by KTOK's Carole Arnold, Moyers explained: "Emerging from their private grief, they appeal for an end of hateful talk and political invective. Their experience is their message. What a society sows, it reaps....This local station has given the families a forum, but it also carries several hours of talk every day that they find inflammatory." The station does not carry Liddy, so the broadside against "hate" and "inflammatory" talk goes undefined. Welch proceded to tell Arnold: "Of course I think the media need to be involved a little bit in a little bit of control of the hate radio going on. I'm very disturbed about that. I mean where's the responsibility?"
<P>
Having impugned talk radio, Moyers turned to the government shutdown: "Just as federal workers were coming out of shock from the bombing, there was another blow, this time from Washington." He asked a HUD supervisor who survived the blast: "It's been a tough year for you federal workers here. The bombing, the furlough, you lost pay for a while. You continue to be demonized in the rhetoric of politics this season. What does that do to your idea of yourself?"
<P>
Finally, Moyers concluded the hour with this seeming indictment of House Speaker Newt Gingrich as co-conspirator: "It will never be the same. The bombers saw to that. The tears and grief, the pain and the sorrow were all intended. Terrorism is the politics of murder. We should have seen it coming. Hate was in the air. Government had been vilified, found guilty and sentenced to die. It didn't matter who was in the way. There are lessons for us here, something to take away from the wreckage of that day, if we're listening, one year later."

Study for the April 1996 Mediawatch.

<P><b>
Network Religion Coverage Still Limited to Roughly One Percent of Total Coverage: Social Liberalism Rears Its Head on TV</b> 
<br>
In their survey The Churching of America, Roger Finke and Rodney Stark reported that virtually all Americans believe in God or a universal spirit. The vast majority believe the Bible is either the literal or inspired Word of God. Sixty percent  can be found in houses of worship in a given month. This "silent majority" still worships under the radar screen of a secularized media elite.
<p>
The Media Research Center's first study of TV news coverage of religion in 1993 found a surprising paucity of  coverage and overt advocacy against traditional values: only 212 evening news stories and 197 morning show segments dealt with religion. Prime-time magazine and Sunday morning interview shows broached religion on only 18 occasions.  Religion coverage declined in 1994. Evening news stories rose slightly to 225, but morning segments fell to 151, and Sunday talk show and magazine show segments dropped to nine. 
<P>
Out of an estimated 18,000 segments last year on the five programs evaluated (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, CNN's World News, NBC Nightly News, and The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour on PBS) the networks devoted only 249 stories to religion, a slight increase (11 percent) from 1994.
  <p>
Despite more than 26,000 segments in 1995, the major network morning shows (ABC's Good Morning America, CBS This Morning, and NBC's Today) devoted 224 morning show stories to religion in 1995. That's a one-third increase over 1994, but still less than one percent. 
<P>
The blind spot to religious news remains especially noticeable on Sunday morning shows and prime-time magazines. Analysts reviewed the Sunday shows (ABC's This Week with David Brinkley, CBS's Face the Nation, NBC's Meet the Press) as well as the prime-time magazine lineup (ABC's Day One, Prime Time Live, and 20/20; CBS's Eye to Eye with Connie Chung, 48 Hours, and 60 Minutes; and NBC's three-night Dateline format). Out of roughly 400 shows, the number of religion stories rose from nine in 1994 to 15 in 1995, including segment repeats. But that also included three one-hour programs on religion, one on ABC and two on CBS. 
<P>
Institutions: The Catholic Church again led the coverage with 111 stories, up eight from 1994. Generic religion stories, often on subjects like school prayer or church-state relations, came in second with 70 stories. News of Protestant denominations was again nearly absent.
<P>
The networks again portrayed the Catholic Church as an oppressive, narrow-minded, outmoded hierarchy. When Ireland moved to lift its ban on divorce, CBS Evening News reporter Cinny Kennard applauded on November 18: "It's another example of the country's move to reinvent itself as a more modern and progressive Ireland, an Ireland that is more tolerant and open. Recently, there has been legal reform on contraception, abortion, and homosexuality; signs that the traditional Church grip on Ireland has been loosened; signs that the country is increasingly run from government buildings and not the Vatican." 
<P>
Kennard repeated her line on the November 30 CBS This Morning: "It's been like an awakening. Ireland, long positioned on the world's stage as a church-dominated backwater, has reinvented itself as a new and energized Emerald Isle. A more open, a more tolerant place."
<P>
Abortion: Due to the lack of further violence against abortionists, coverage of violence around abortion clinics on all shows amounted to 142 stories, compared to the 247 in 1994 and 150 segments in 1993. 
<P>
On January 3, 1995 Jane Pauley promoted an upcoming segment on Dateline NBC by charging: "Still ahead -- the latest round of bloodshed and violence at abortion clinics. The anti-abortion movement has been creeping to the edge of bloody fanaticism for a decade." With coverage like that, reporter David Culhane could convey the results of a new poll during the January 8 CBS Evening News: "A new CBS poll shows that three out of four Americans say the protest tactics of some anti-abortion activists can be blamed for leading to the recent shootings at several abortion clinics." 
<p>
What about violence perpetrated by abortion advocates? In 1994, only CNN reported that Ernest Robertson Jr. tried to shoot a pro-life protester after picking up his wife outside a Baton Rouge, Louisiana abortion clinic. In 1995, Daniel Adam Mahoney became the first pro-abortion activist indicted under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. Alice Hand was arrested in January 1995 for making at least three phone calls threatening to blow-up a Catholic church and school in Suffern, New York. But the networks were silent. 
<P>
While the networks devoted 142 stories to anti-abortion violence outside clinics, only three alluded to violence inside. CNN's September 12 World News broadcast one segment about abortionist David Benjamin, who was convicted of second degree murder in New York City for allowing a woman to bleed to death from a perforated uterus during an abortion. Two 1995 segments aired estimates of 1.5 million abortions a year, two more mentions than in 1993 or 1994. 
<P>

Social Issues: The number of stories primarily about homosexuality increased from 105 in 1994 to 113 in 1995, still a fraction of the 1993 total of 756. But the networks demonstrated a liberal orientation once again: in the few morning show interviews that aired, proponents of homosexuality outnumbered opponents, 13 to 3. 
Once again, the networks portrayed the religious right as a negative force in the Republican Party. While the networks would not suggest that a liberal group like the NAACP doesn't represent all black people, CBS suggested the Christian Coalition did not represent all Christians -- or suggested they were less than Christian.
<P>
Dan Rather introduced a September 8 story by noting Phil Gramm "was at a meeting of preacher Pat Robertson's political group, the one calling itself the Christian Coalition." Four months earlier, on May 15, Rather charged: "The group calling itself the Christian Coalition is aligned with hard-right stands on issues ranging from gay rights to school prayer, and it's demanding its due for its help in getting Republicans elected."

<title> Issue Analysis: Income Stories Ignore Total Compensation</title>
</head>

<center>
<h2> Issue Analysis: Income Stories Ignore Total Compensation </h2>
<h4>Network Reporting a Slave to Wages </h4>
</center>
Last month, <I>MediaNomics</I> reported that there were 19 stories about layoffs during the first two months of 1996, but only two stories about job growth. We noted how such a focus on the negative offered a distorted picture of the true nature of a competitive economy, which does destroy some jobs, but always creates more jobs.
<p>
The sister issue to job creation is living standards. A competitive economy would be of little benefit to workers if it caused their standard of living to decrease. Media Research Center analysts reviewed every story that focused on wages and incomes on network morning and evening shows during the first three months of 1996. Ten of the 11 stories stressed the alleged wage stagnation of average workers over the last few decades. Only one story pointed out that opportunities have been increasing. No story pointed out that when benefits and payroll taxes are included, workers' total compensation has been steadily increasing.
<p>
A lack of diversity in guest selection kept the morning shows from giving viewers a balanced story. For instance, on the March 12 <I>Today</I>, Bryant Gumbel interviewed only Jared Bernstein of the liberal Economic Policy Institute. Introducing the segment, Gumbel pointed out that the U.S. economy has created eight million new jobs over the last three years, adding that "the quantity of jobs is not being questioned, but the quality is."
<p>
Bernstein then said that "wages and compensation have been falling in our labor market since 1979 for most workers. yet in the current economy, profit rates, or corporate profits, are at a 30-year high." Bernstein also claimed that "this is a long-term trend and workers are experiencing falling wages and compensation and even increased turnover. That is, we have less stable employment and the typical American family is really running faster just to stay in place."
<p>
Gumbel's reaction: "OK, so let us accept all of that as fact. Could it be otherwise?" Since Gumbel didn't provide an alternative opinion, viewers had no choice but to accept Bernstein's assertions as fact.
Other reporters also seemed to assume that accounts of workers' falling wages was a fact. On the February 26 CBS Evening News, Dan Rather concluded that "the fear and anger of some American workers over layoffs and barely rising wages have emerged as a campaign issue." Earlier, on the February 22 CBS Evening News, Rather said: "Millions of American workers know it. Despite soaring profits and a record Wall Street, U.S. businesses are still cutting good jobs and barely raising wages."
<p>
On that same broadcast, correspondent Wyatt Andrews portrayed "an increasingly anxious middle class, whose dreams of upward mobility have met a downward reality." According to NBC's Mike Jensen, on the March 4 Nightly News, "William Young of California is typical -- 50, a victim of downsizing, laid off by Northrup after 29 years in the aerospace industry."
<p>
On the February 25 <I>World News Sunday</I>, ABC's Jeff Greenfield, normally one of the most balanced reporters at the networks, also bought the party line. He reported "something very disturbing behind the record Wall Street numbers and corporate profits." He interviewed a Wall Street economist who said, "This surge in financial markets was really based on an untenable situation of workers taking a real squeeze in living standards to improve corporate profit margins and competitive prowess." Greenfield called this the "dark side of productivity."
<p>
But just how dark is the American wage and income picture? According to Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas economists W. Michael Cox and Beverly J. Fox, writing in a January National Center for Policy Analysis Policy Backgrounder, it's not as bad as many have been led to believe. The problem with most analyses of stagnating wages is they don't look at benefits. Cox and Fox pointed out that "employee benefits have grown from 20 percent of payroll in 1953 to more than 41 percent today." Since benefits aren't taxed, they argue, employees have sought benefit increases. Increasing payroll taxes have also taken a bite out of wages.
<p>
Cox and Fox also maintain that looking at stagnating household income, as Bernstein apparently was, is misleading. "Today's households are nearly 15 percent smaller than they were in the 1970s -- so household income is spread over fewer people," they report. "The median family income statistics for yesterday's Brady Bunch cannot be accurately compared with those of today's Murphy Brown." Overall, Cox and Fox demonstrate that "per capita real personal income increased an average of 1.4 percent a year" from 1974 through 1993. Unfortunately neither they nor like-minded economists were interviewed by network reporters.
<p>
Only NBC's Jim Avila, on the March 4 <I>Nightly News</I>, gave any hint that the job and wage picture for American workers was not completely bleak. Though he didn't point out that total compensation has been increasing for American workers over the last few decades, he did look at small businesses creating jobs and noted that "many of the new jobs being created provide good salaries, full benefits, and something some of the old jobs did not provide -- a piece of the action. Often small companies offer new employees stock options and other incentives." According to Avila, "The workplace has changed, perhaps forever. The job security of the past replaced by uncertainty and, more often than you might think, also replaced by new opportunity." But, of course, Avila was the exception.

<h3>NBC: Tough on Criminals?</h3>
<p>
Any suggested link between crime and welfare dependency is usually dismissed by the media as Willie Horton redux. However, Elizabeth Vargas' March 26 Dateline report showed that often welfare money acts as a direct subsidy for scofflaws.
Vargas noted there are "more than 415,000 fugitives on the lam across the country, men and women wanted by the law for serious crimes." After a morning expedition with the Cuyahoga Ohio County Sheriff department, knocking on doors in a fruitless search for a fugitive, she noted that "just a few blocks away from the sheriff's department is all the information those officers say they need. Here in this office are the names, addresses, phone numbers, even photographs, of some of those fugitives from justice. People fleeing from the law but not from the welfare department."
Vargas deftly phrased the irony: "So, while one government agency spends your tax dollars to find fugitives from the law, another government agency gives more of your tax dollars, welfare, to fugitives in hiding." 
After interviewing county welfare director Joseph Garcia claiming the police were on a "fishing expedition" and targeting the poor, Vargas noted that after McFall went public with his battle against federal privacy laws that prevent welfare departments from sharing names and addresses, "deputies are getting some information."
Robert Hager probed the same politically incorrect line in his Fleecing of America report on the April 24 Nightly News. 
Anchor Tom Brokaw introduced the story: "How would you feel if you found out your tax dollars were paying a massive telephone bill for calls that never should have been made, calls coming from prisoners?"
Hager related the General Accounting Office findings of prisoners calling the Agriculture Department -- collect: "652 collect calls accepted from eighteen prisons in all, in just the four months auditors sampled." Hager explained, "The prisoners had found dishonest employees at the Agricultural Department's Washington headquarters, willing to forward on their calls long-distance to whomever the prisoners wanted to talk to, private individuals, anywhere, at taxpayers expense," even calls to sex lines in the Dominican Republic.
<p>
<h3>Stossel on Davis-Bacon</h3>
<p>
In 1931, Congress passed the Davis Bacon Act, prompted by white laborers who were upset that blacks were underbidding them on government contracts. Davis Bacon sets minimum wages for contractors that build government buildings. On the April 12 20/20, ABC's John Stossel looked at how this out-dated government regulation continues to cost taxpayers millions and benefits a major contributor to the Democratic Party: labor unions.
Stossel started at the Labor Department, the agency that enforces Davis Bacon. Stossel explained: "Dozens of them [employees] here, and others in state and city labor departments, spend their time deciding what construction workers on government projects must be paid. The result? Government buildings cost more and poor people who want to work can't." Stossel explained: "Carpenter David Shepherd must get $29 an hour. Normally he makes $15. Sheet metal worker Mike Harley has his pay doubled by the Labor Department."
Stossel explained how the Labor Department uses a complicated formula to issue their wage edicts. In turn, prevailing wages are often set higher than union wages so open-shop contractors can't underbid union shops. Stossel referred to the unions clout: "It is true that the law protects union jobs from cheaper competition. And if a Congressman even discusses changing the law, crowds like this [footage of a congressional hearing with union members] will remind him of the union's clout. Congress' most potent defender of Davis Bacon has been Sen. Edward Kennedy. He declined our request to talk about this."
Stossel went on to point out that while these higher wages may benefit some, there's also a downside for less-skilled laborers. Stossel pointed out: "A side effect of fixing wages is that some workers end up being excluded." At Cabrini Green in Chicago, one of the nation's poorest housing projects, the government is doing repairs. Some construction workers who reside at Cabrini Green would like to be hired to do the work, but as Stossel learned: "They can't get hired because when contractors are forced to pay high Davis Bacon salaries even for the simplest jobs, they're not going to take a chance on inexperienced strangers, they're going to use their most experienced workers."

<p>
<h3>Issue Analysis: Reporters Miss Important Angles of Debate<br>
MINIMUM WAGE</h3>
<p>

One of the key debates currently defining the differences between Republicans and Democrats is the argument over efforts to raise the minimum wage. Democrats argue that the government can legislate higher pay for those earning the minimum wage without harming anyone. Republicans, on the other hand, argue that by artificially raising wages, the government will cause employers to lay off workers.
<p>
On which side did the media weigh in? Media Research Center analysts reviewed all of the minimum wage stories on evening news shows (ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC) and morning news shows (ABC, CBS, NBC). There were 36 stories and anchor-reads about the debate. With a few notable exceptions, the networks took the side of those supporting a minimum wage increase. For example:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Soundbite sources were almost twice as likely to be supporters of the minimum wage increase than opponents. Out of 60 soundbite sources, 39 supported the minimum wage increase, while only 21 were opposed to it. Several stories contained soundbites from only Democrats and their allies.
<p>
Bob Schieffer's April 25 CBS Evening News report, for instance, had soundbites from Democrats Maxine Waters, Ted Kennedy, Al Gore, and two minimum wage workers whom the Democrats had brought to Washington for a news conference. "Democrats will keep the pressure up," Schieffer said. "They believe that Republicans are taking such a pounding on this they'll eventually allow a vote." He didn't tell viewers what Republicans believed.
<p>
This emphasis on supporters of the minimum wage hike led some reporters to just accept the Democrats' opinion that the wage could be increased without harming workers. According to NBC's Lisa Myers, on the April 17 Nightly News, a minimum wage increase would be "good news for about 10 million workers now earning near the minimum wage of $4.25 an hour, frozen since 1989." CNN's Kathleen Kennedy, on the April 24 The World Tonight, worried that "people earning the minimum wage may not get a raise anytime soon. Despite political pressure from both parties, House Republican leaders Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey have virtually ruled out scheduling a vote on the minimum wage increase."
<p>
<li>The political horse-race aspect of the debate was emphasized far more than the economics of the debate. There were only three soundbites from economists. There were 46 soundbites from politicians. The networks were much more interested in who would win and lose politically from the debate than what the effect would be on the country. According to NBC's Tom Brokaw, on the April 17 Nightly News, it was likely that "the most basic wage in this country affecting millions of workers and businesses will go up. But, who gets the credit?"
<p>
This weighed heavily on the minds of other reporters, as well. NBC's Jim Miklaszewski, on the April 24 Nightly News, predicted that "by digging in their heals, Republicans may also be digging themselves into a political hole." And ABC's Cokie Roberts, on the April 23 Good Morning America, said: "If the Republicans are stuck going along, then they want to get some credit."
<p>
<li>Journalists were more interested in interviewing other journalists than in interviewing economists. On the morning news shows, the obsession with political angles reached almost comic proportions. On the morning shows, where live interviews are common, there were five such interviews of journalists about the minimum wage. There were none with economists.
<p>
ABC's Willow Bay interviewed ABC's Sam Donaldson on a Good Morning America Sunday segment. ABC's Charles Gibson interviewed ABC's Cokie Roberts and ABC's Tyler Mathison on a Good Morning America segment. NBC's Bryant Gumbel interviewed NBC's Tim Russert on a Today segment. And CBS's Harry Smith interviewed The Weekly Standard's Fred Barnes. None of these shows were interested in the insights of economists, however.
<p>
<li>There was more skepticism of Republican motives than Democratic motives. Three stories suggested that Republicans opposed raising the minimum wage because their business allies opposed it. ABC's Carole Simpson, on the April 28 World News Sunday, reported that Republicans "say [a minimum wage hike] is bad for small business." According to Bob Schieffer, on the April 17 CBS Evening News, Republicans "know polls show most Americans favor an increase, but many of their business allies oppose it." Neither Simpson or Schieffer suggested that Republicans may oppose an increase because it would hurt workers.
<p>
No reporter made the similar charge against Democrats, that they support the increase simply because their labor allies support it. NBC's Jim Miklaszewski, on the April 25 Today, did at least state that there was a principle at stake for the GOP: "They can stand their ground on principle on this issue, but lose ground in public opinion." He did not explain what that principle was, though.
<p>
<li>The one study of the impact of minimum wage increases cited by reporters is one most economists disavow. The infamous Card-Krueger study, named after the two economists who directed it, was mentioned favorably in two stories. Card and Krueger looked at the impact of a minimum wage increase in New Jersey, compared to neighboring Pennsylvania, which hadn't increased its state minimum wage. They found that there was no job loss in New Jersey due to the increase. Since this is one of the only studies to produce such a finding, it is often cited by advocates of increasing the minimum wage.
<p>
ABC's Tyler Mathison mentioned the study on the April 23 Good Morning America. NBC's Mike Jensen also mentioned it favorably on the April 26 Nightly News. Neither of them mentioned the well-publicized problems many economists found with the study's methodology. Jensen, in fact, used a soundbite from one of the study's chief critics, economist Richard Berman, but didn't mention his criticisms of the study. He even employed an Alan Krueger soundbite to refute Berman.
<p>
There were exceptions.
<p>
Anthony Mason, interview with Republican Senator Don Nickles and Democratic Congressman David Bonior: "After the last increase in the minimum wage, Department of Labor statistics show we lost some half a million jobs, I believe. Is this going to cost us jobs? Are we making a mistake if we do this now?" Mason: "Congressman, in the first two years of President Clinton's term, when you controlled Congress, this issue was never brought up. Why is it on the table suddenly now, when we're running up to an election. You had an opportunity to something and it wasn't done then."

<h2>Janet Cooke Award</h2>

<H3>Legal Services or Liberal Services?<BR>
CBS Reporter Terence Smith Touts<BR>  
Politicized Lawyers' Work "For The Poor"</H3>
<P>
<DD>To convince Congress they deserve more funding, advocates of government  
programs regularly highlight examples of all those the program benefits.  
Reporters should look for the reality. For touting the Legal Services  
Corporation (LSC) as if he were on staff, CBS's Terence Smith earned the  
Janet Cooke Award.
<DD>His April 28 Sunday Morning story focused on Legal Services of Greater  
Miami: "They deal mostly with bread-and-butter issues: housing,  
employment, custody, divorce. The concept of helping the poor with their  
problems would seem, on the face of it, to be something most Americans  
could agree upon. But Legal Services is one of those hot-button issues  
that divides people on political, practical, and ideological grounds."
CBS did not present a balanced slate of proponents and opponents, with  
18 soundbites of LSC backers and three from LSC opponent Rep. Charles  
Taylor (R-N.C.), who revealed: "Many of the cases that I've seen are  
very extreme, radical areas that are being funded by the taxpayers...It  
is not the average elderly person being evicted from homes that you  
would have people believe that you defend. There's more of this radical  
view, I see, funded by the taxpayer."
<DD>Smith never allowed Taylor to elaborate. For decades, the LSC has used  
its grants to fight against conservative policies. As LSC chairman,  
Hillary Clinton funneled taxpayer money into defeating a 1980 California  
ballot initiative (Proposition 9) to cut state income taxes in half. In  
1983, the General Accounting Office cited the LSC for violating  
statutory bars against partisan activity. 
<DD>In 1994, The Washington Times reported the state of California was  
forced by the LSC-funded Western Center on Law and Poverty to revoke a  
2.3 percent reduction in welfare payments, costing an estimated $5.6  
million a month. They also filed successful suits to increase payments  
to MediCal, the state's Medicaid plan, and force the state to pay day  
 been terminated by this particular time." 20
Smith moved on: "Barbara Goulsby is the Legal Services attorney for  
Damon Johnson, and 36 families who lost their possessions when Miami  
police suddenly evicted them from their apartment building in a  
drug-infested neighborhood. The city said the building was a center for  
drug activity." 
<DD>To complete the picture of victims, Smith added: "Daniel Barker, another  
Legal Services attorney, is helping Deborah Williams fight eviction from  
her apartment...He interceded with the public housing authority, which  
had accused her of having unauthorized persons living in the apartment."  
Smith asked Williams: "Where would you have been without Legal  
Services?...On the street?" Williams agreed: "Yes, exactly, okay?"
CBS did not investigate whether LSC grantees use tax dollars to fight  
the eviction of drug dealers from public housing. The August 15, 1994  
New York Times reported a group representing 500,000 New York tenants  
entered a case to back expedited eviction of drug dealers, only to be  
opposed by the Legal Aid Society, an LSC grantee. (New York public  
housing officials declared drug-related arrests in their complexes grew  
from 813 in 1973 to 11,092 in 1993). As Boehm testified to Congress: "A  
program determined to use public funds to keep drug dealers in public  
housing -- in the name of helping the poor -- is a program that's lost  
what it means to help the poor."
<DD>Smith asked: "So what are the prospects for Legal Services, given the  
current political climate?...Charles Taylor wants to kill the program."  
Taylor declared: "We've been able to take it from $400 million down to  
283, right at the moment. We need to take it to zero." Smith noted:  
"That won't happen this year. But last week Congress imposed new  
restrictions on Legal Service attorneys, barring them from bringing  
class-action suits, challenging welfare reform, and representing many  
immigrants." Smith did not explain why the new restrictions were  
necessary.
<DD>Taylor's press secretary, Jack Cox, told MediaWatch the CBS story  
followed a formula: "Every single time we've done an interview, the  
reporter finds one local group, interviews a few nice little fuzzy cases  
where people say `I couldn't live without them,' and then they quote us  
saying `Zero it out.' They never let us give the justifications for  
zeroing it out. I sat in on the CBS interview for more than an hour.  
[Taylor] must have hammered home the drug-dealer issue about 40 times to  
 get it into the piece." It didn't get in.
<DD>Smith told MediaWatch he stood by his use of Taylor: "I would argue  
that's a very full description of his view of Legal Services." As for  
the story's imbalance, Smith declared, "Obviously, I think it was fair."  
When asked about drug-related evictions, Smith protested that he was  
unfamiliar with the New York case and insisted: "Taylor did not cite a  
single specific case. When I asked attorneys in Florida, they said  
they'd never represent a convicted drug pusher."

<H2>Media Clique Clap for Clinton</H2>
<H3>Nine of Ten Washington Reporters Voted  
for Clinton; Are Liberal by 6 to 1
</H3>
<DD>When Americans went to the polls in 1992, 43 percent voted for Bill  
Clinton and 38 percent for George Bush. But the results were very  
different in another America, the news media's Washington bureaus.  A  
poll of 139 bureau chiefs and congressional reporters discovered 89  
percent pulled the lever for Clinton and seven percent picked Bush.  
In mid-April the Freedom Forum released a report examining  
media-congressional relations. Buried in the appendix were "a few final  
questions for classification purposes only." These were part of a 58  
question Roper Center survey completed by mail in November and December  
1995. 
<DD>Asked "How would you characterize your political orientation?" 61  
percent said "liberal" or "liberal to moderate." Only nine percent  
labeled themselves "conservative" or "moderate to conservative."
The poll also found that 59 percent considered the Contract with America  
"an election-year campaign ploy" while only three percent thought it was  
"a serious reform proposal." A decisive 85 percent admitted they were  
"very" or "somewhat" surprised by the 1994 GOP win. 
<DD>So do these views affect the news? Study chief and former Chicago  
Tribune reporter Elaine Povich told the April 18 Washington Times: "One  
of the things about being a professional is that you attempt to leave  
your personal feelings aside as you do your work." Boston Globe Editor  
Matthew Storin insisted on CNN's Reliable Sources April 21: "I think,  
actually, those figures are a great endorsement for the professionalism  
of our business. Has anyone looked at the coverage of Bill Clinton's  
administration? I mean, it's been, almost from the get-go, negative."
On the April 28 Fox News Sunday Linda Chavez opined that people realize  
reporters' personal views influence their reporting, prompting Wall  
Street Journal Executive Washington Editor Al Hunt to coun-ter: "If that  
poll is correct, it basically reaffirms the argument that Linda just  
argued against. Which is, would anyone argue that Bill Clinton has  
gotten an easy press the last three years? If 89 percent voted for him,  
he's gotten an awfully tough press." Later he asked incredulously: "You  
think his health care proposals got a good press?"
One reporter on the CNN show realized the impact. The Washington Post's  
Howard Kurtz explained: "Clearly anybody looking at those numbers, if  
they're even close to accurate, would conclude that there is a diversity  
problem in the news business, and it's not just the kind of diversity we  
usually talk about, which is not getting enough minorities in the news  
business, but political diversity, as well. Anybody who doesn't see that  
is just in denial." Indeed.

<h2>Revolving Door</h2>
<P>
<H4>Snow on Sunday</H4>

<DD>To moderate its new Sunday morning public affairs show, Fox News Sunday,  
the network tapped Tony Snow. Those hired by the media who have liberal  
ties don't raise a concern in the journalistic world. But the selection  
of the conservative Snow prompted some reporters to question the slant  
of the show, although Marty Ryan, former Executive Producer of NBC's  
Today, will hold the same title with Fox News Sunday. "A rabidly  
conservative columnist and former speechwriter for President George  
Bush, Snow knows that his right-wing image may put off lefties,"  
declared Philadelphia Inquirer television reporter Gail Shister on April  
8.  Shister explained that "as for some critics' contentions that Snow could  
be `tainted' by his Bush connections, he says: `I've worked for half as  
many politicians'" as Meet the Press host Tim Russert, who toiled for  
former Governor Mario Cuomo and Senator Daniel Moynihan, both New York  
Democrats. The show, which premiered April 28, is aimed at younger  
viewers and will include questions sent via the internet.
<P>
<H4>Filling the Slate</H4>
<P>
<DD>Michael Kinsley, Editor of Microsoft's new online publication, Slate,  
has built his team. Among those tapped by the liberal former co-host of  
CNN's Crossfire: Jodie Allen, Editor of the Washington Post Outlook  
section since 1990, who served under President Carter as Deputy  
Secretary of Labor for policy evaluation and research. For Slate, to  
debut May 31 on the internet, she'll be the Washington editor.
<P>
<H4>Revolving Online</H4>
<P>
<DD>First she reported the news, then she spun the news. Now Kathleen  
deLaski will do both in cyberspace in a post which involves covering  
Clinton's re-election effort. America Online, the on-line computer  
service, National Journal reported March 16, "has hired deLaski to  
direct campaign coverage for its politics channel." In 1988 she became  
an on-air Washington reporter for ABC News. She jumped to the Clinton  
team in 1993 as Chief Public Affairs Officer for the Defense Department.  
For the past year she's been Deputy to the Undersecretary for Policy  
Liaison.
<P>
<H4>Recalling Candidacy</H4>
<P>
<DD>Since late last year Walter Shapiro, Press Secretary to Carter Labor  
Secretary Ray Marshall and a Time Senior Editor from 1987 to 1993, has  
penned a twice-weekly news section column for USA Today. 20
Shapiro began his April 12 "Hype & Glory," in which he fawned over  
Victor Morales, the Democratic Senate nominee in Texas, by recalling his  
own early partisan foray: "Nearly a quarter of a century ago, at the  
height of the Vietnam War, I was seized by the quixotic notion that  
anti-war students deserved representation in Congress." At the time he  
was a 25-year-old graduate student at the University of Michigan.  
Shapiro lost, but he noted "I did come within 1,400 votes of winning a  
six-way Democratic Primary. My partisan days are long behind me."
<P>
<H4>Willie Hortonizing CNN<H4>
<P>
<DD>CNN announced in March that Ken Bode, a top aide in Democrat Morris  
Udall's 1976 presidential run, will be a national political analyst. An  
April 26 Washington Week in Review look at Bob Dole's claim that Clinton  
has nominated liberal judges, offered a preview of Bode's analysis. From  
his perch as moderator of the PBS show, Bode asked: "So, federal judges  
are going to become this year's Willie Horton?"

<h2>Hugh Downs' Hate Radio--ABC's Avuncular Star On the Left</h2>

<DD>Hugh Downs may seem harmless hosting 20/20, but in the Spring Forbes  
MediaCritic Steve Kroll revealed another side -- a liberal ideologue in  
weekly commentaries for ABC Radio's Perspectives. From1990: "The  
Reagan-Bush team did more than just support dictatorial rule around the  
world. It helped foster a climate of dictatorship at home." In 1994, on  
the Gulf War: "Nobody in his right mind would incinerate or blow up  
innocent children, but that's exactly what the United Nation's said that  
American bombs did in Iraq."
<DD>Downs had quite a conspiratorial view of the discredited October  
Surprise theory, which he said "has tentacles that reach deep into the  
empire of Manuel Noriega, into the scandal at BCCI, and into  
the...destruction of Iraq....For 11 years suspicions have grown that  
renegade intelligence officers illegally seized the American  
government....There is a growing number of reasons to believe that the  
October Surprise is true." 
<DD>Finally, Kroll noted that Downs attempted to "liken Ronald Reagan to a  
communist dictator because he entertained the idea of repealing the 22nd  
Amendment, which limits a President to two terms. While Gorbachev  
attempts `to liberalize the Soviet Union by adopting Thomas Jefferson's  
democracy,' opined Downs, Reagan `in almost mirror-like fashion,' moves  
`toward absolute rule.'"

<h2>Bright Side. Liberal Bias Admitted</h2><p>

A major media figure has conceded that liberal bias really exists. On the May 12 Inside
Washington, host Gordon Peterson raised House Speaker Newt Gingrich's charge that the media are
in a "passive conspiracy" to help President Clinton. NPR's Nina Totenberg shot back: "I think
it's basically sour grapes....and I'm tired of politicians just sort of saying, when things go
badly for them, blaming us. It's not our fault, it's their fault." But then Evan Thomas,
Newsweek's Washington Bureau Chief, asserted: "They blame us, but this is true. There is a
liberal bias. It's demonstrable. You look at some statistics. About 85 percent of the reporters
who cover the White House vote Democratic, they have for a long time. Particularly at the
networks, at the lower levels, among the editors and the so-called infrastructure, there is a
liberal bias. There is a liberal bias at Newsweek, the magazine I work for -- most of the people
who work at Newsweek live on the upper West Side in New York and they have a liberal bias."
Thomas, however, didn't make a full confession, denying any bias with those under him: "I don't
think it's so much Washington. It's New York. You have to look at which city we're talking
about. It's where the networks are based. It's where The New York Times is based. I think the
greatest liberal bias is amongst the people who work for large, major news organizations in New
York."<p>

<h2>Verdict: Media Guilty of Apathy--Networks Aggressively Ignored the Crimes of Whitewater</h2><p>

The media elite keeps waiting for Whitewater to end.  "Is this basically the end of
Whitewater?," asked New York Times reporter Linda Greenhouse on PBS's Washington Week in Review
after the First Lady's cattle-futures press conference in 1994. "Whitewater is...sort of
diminishing, sort of fading away," predicted host Ken Bode on the same program on May 24. Just
four days later, Bode and other reporters were embarrassed when the story exploded with 24 fraud
and conspiracy convictions of President Clinton's business partners, Jim and Susan McDougal, and
Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker.

After NBC Nightly News aired only one reporter-based story in the entire three months of the
trial, anchor Tom Brokaw asked Washington Bureau Chief Tim Russert May 28, the night of the
convictions: "Alfonse D'Amato, the Republican Senator who's been running the Whitewater hearings
on Capitol Hill, has so much as admitted recently that he didn't get very far. There have been
any number of exhaustive journalistic efforts. What do we think may be out there? Anything
left?"

On CBS, Dan Rather quickly disposed of "Republican special prosecutor Kenneth Starr" and spent
15 minutes on newly discovered footage surrounding John F. Kennedy's 1963 assassination. When he
returned to the trial, Rather twice insisted "President Clinton was not charged with anything in
this trial." Reporters Scott Pelley (once) and  Rita Braver (twice) repeated that the President
was not a target of investigation. 

The convictions were a stark contrast to the stunning lack of TV coverage of the trial. A
MediaWatch analysis from February 29 to May 28 found the Big Three networks aired only 13
reporter-based Whitewater stories on their evening news shows -- an average of about four
stories per network over three months. (CNN's The World Today reported ten stories.) The three
morning shows also yawned at the story, airing only 14 reporter-based stories and five
interviews during that time. 

Other Clinton scandals continue to be ignored.  On April 5, the Los Angeles Times  broke the
story that the Clinton administration secretly encouraged Iran to send arms to the Bosnian
Muslims while Clinton publicly defended the arms embargo. CBS and NBC have not broadcast a
single evening news story. ABC aired two evening anchor briefs, CNN's The World Today, three.

The networks have yet to touch the May 2 Washington Times story of how Senate Democrats have
placed a hold on a bill reimbursing former White House Travel Office chief Billy Dale for
$500,000 in legal fees -- money he spent defending himself against the Clintons' false charges
that he was an embezzler.<p>
<h2>Setting an Example</h2><p>

While the television networks have been reluctant to cover Whitewater, the print
 media have been
much more thorough. The June 2 Washington Post ran an in-depth, front page story
 on the scandal,
focusing on the role of First Lady Hillary Clinton, concluding that: "Her public
 record suggests
conflicts with self-portrait of naivete."<p>
The nearly five-page story story by David Maraniss and Susan Schmidt looked at t
he conflict
between what Mrs. Clinton has stated and the documented record. While  most of t
he story looked
at the players involved and recounted the entire scandal, the Post prefaced the
story: "The
image is of a mere bystander, a good person victimized. But an examination of Hi
llary Clinton's
public statements suggests someone less passive in her behavior, less consistent
 in her answers,
and less committed to full disclosure than the figure in her self-portrait....He
r wording seems
alternately terse and lawyerly, providing the narrowest possible answers, and un
abashedly
political, ornamented with asides and anecdotes."  <p>

<h2>Newsbites</h2><p>


<h3>Dole's Code</h3><p>

How will the media cover Bob Dole and Bill Clinton clashing on issues? The May 23 CBS Evening
News offered a preview of how Dole is the divider while Clinton is the unifier. First, reporter
Phil Jones analyzed Dole's criticism of Clinton's veto of the partial birth abortion ban. Jones
predicted it would energize the religious right, but that it really served a more sinister
purpose: "It's also Dole campaign code. When he talks about abortion, that leads to morality.
When he talks about morality, that raises the issue of character. And that's exactly what Dole
and the Republicans want -- to force a presidential election based on Bill Clinton's character."<p>

Next, Rita Braver praised Clinton: "The White House had expected the Republicans to go negative,
but not this hard, this fast. And the President's remarks were very well thought out. He was
sending Dole a message that your remarks are not going to go unchallenged." Braver then
criticized Dole for raising the issue: "You could see the President's strategy here and that is
to tell Americans that Bob Dole is dragging the campaign into the mud and trying to divide the
country."<p>


<h3>Hands Off Clinton </h3>

The Bush campaign got lambasted over Willie Horton while the media ignored that future Vice
President Al Gore first raised Horton in a 1988 primary debate. This year, while fulminating
about a 1990 ad from Republican Jesse Helms, the media failed to dredge up the President's
relationship to the man behind the Helms ad, Dick Morris.<p>

NBC's Bob Faw warned May 7 that "every time he has run, Helms has exploited racial tension." Faw
showed a clip of the Helms' 1990 affirmative action ad, "Hands," showing a pair of white hands
crumpling up a job rejection letter: "You needed that job, and you were the best qualified. But
they had to give it to a minority."  Faw continued: "For many voters here the basic if
bedeviling question is whether a black or white challenger has a better chance against an
incumbent who in the past has played the race card and can be expected to do so again." (Black
1990 candidate Harvey Gantt won the primary again this year.) On May 5 ABC's Carla Hill played
the ad, adding: "Jesse Helms successfully played the race card against Gantt in 1990." Los
Angeles Times reporter Eric Harrison wrote May 11: "Helms unleashed a barrage of racially
inflammatory television commercials as the close contest came to an end and defeated Gantt by
six percentage points."<p>

Only reporter Lloyd Grove noted, sotto voce, in the 35th paragraph of a May 24 Washington Post
profile of Gantt: "One of his [Helms'] key advisers -- pollster Richard Morris, who has taken
credit for conceiving the so-called `Hands' spot -- is working this year for President Clinton."<p>

<h3>A Lying Shame</h3><p>

As part of NBC's week-long series on "Dishonesty in America: Lie, Cheat, Steal," the May 19
Dateline NBC aired a story on how to recognize when someone is lying. With the Clintons telling
whoppers weekly, NBC wouldn't have to go back very far to find some good examples. Instead,
reporter Sara James left an amazing impression: only Republicans lie. <p>

James interviewed Paul Eckman, a psychologist who trains law enforcement officers to detect
lies. Eckman used video of five liars to demonstrate his techniques; child murderer Susan Smith,
former Los Angeles police detective Mark Fuhrman, Oliver North, who James stated lied "in the
name of country," and Reagan national security aide John Poindexter. Closing the piece, James
showed a video of Richard Nixon denying involvement in Watergate. She stated: "Eckman is the
first to admit that many lies, especially when they come in prepared statements, are tough to
catch. As America discovered, it was far from the truth, but not even Paul Eckman knew that
Richard Nixon was lying back then." Before the James story aired, Dateline promos left the same
partisan impression, showing only Nixon and North, not the Clintons.<p>


<h3>Murdering Genius</h3><p>

The Unabomber was just a troubled soul who lost his way, said The New York Times. "Theodore
Kaczynski: Unabomb Suspect's Tortured Genius and Lost Promise" blared a May 26 front page
headline. Reporter Robert McFadden set a romanticized scene: "It was just a dusty, cobwebbed
cabin high in the Rockies, as remote as a cougar's lair. But it suited a man who had always been
alone, this genius with gifts for solitude, perseverance, secrecy and meticulousness, for
penetrating the mysteries of mathematics and the dangers of technology, but never love, never
friendship." McFadden continued: "The furnishings were the fragments of his life: the books for
companionship and the bunk for the lonely hours, the wood stove where night after night he
watched dying embers flicker visions of a wretched humanity, the typewriter where, the
authorities say, the justifications for murder had been crafted like numbered theorems." Put the
Hammer Down.<p>

Reporters constantly argue for the most expansive interpretation of the Bill of Rights. But
there's one amendment on which reporters' interpretations become very narrow -- the Second. 
Look at how Jack Ford assaulted National Rifle Association President Marion Hammer on the April
28 Today. Ford asserted: "Assault weapons. The NRA has been consistent in its opposition to any
restrictions on assault weapons. What possible compelling reason is there for private citizens
to own assault weapons?" Ford also asked, "What would you say to the mother of an inner-city
child who was killed by stray gunfire? How would you explain to that mother why the rights to
own weapons are more important than that mother's child?" Finally, he raised the now standard
media linkage, "We've seen recently that members of anti-government groups, militia groups, have
been linked, if not directly, in some ways philosophically, with the NRA. Are you concerned
about that?"<p>


<h3>Stacked Reporting</h3><p>

Do you wonder if reporters make up facts or use questionable information to support their own
views? ABC's Lynn Sherr did in an April 26 20/20 in which she argued "the number one way to get
sexy, in many women's minds, is with larger breasts."<p>

But Washington Post pollster Richard Morin revealed May 19 that Sherr ignored ABC's own
scientific poll conducted specifically for the story. Instead she relied on an unscientific Self
magazine survey which found that half the women felt their bosoms were "inadequate." In fact,
the ABC poll found only 23 percent had "ever" wished their breasts were a different size. Asked
by Barbara Walters whether breast size is most important to men, Sherr explained that the ABC
poll found that "It's the face first, breasts come a close second." Really? Morin noticed that
at eight percent, breasts came in a distant fourth place.<p>


<h3>Park Panic</h3><p>

As summer approached the media offered a barrage of stories decrying the condition of the
national parks and laying the blame at the feet of the Republican Congress.  The Los Angeles
Times led the charge with a May 14 story titled, "Tapped-Out National Parks Turn to Corporations
for Aid." Staff writer D'Jamila Salem began: "As Congress pulls the purse strings tighter, the
National Park Service is turning to corporate America for funds to refurbish and maintain many
of the nation's parks and memorials, including the Washington Monument....The National Park
Service has a 1996 budget of $1.32 billion, down $67 million from 1995." But the Heritage
Foundation's Scott Hodge told MediaWatch the Park Service's budget has risen $79 million from
$1.488 billion in 1993 to an estimated $1.567 billion for 1996.<p>

NBC's Bryant Gumbel opened a May 24 Today interview: "On Close Up this morning, our national
parks are in a bit of trouble...Budget cutbacks have left many more understaffed struggling to
cope with the needs of visitors." Talking to two park service officials, Gumbel queried, "How
much have you had to cut those regular levels of seasonal employees?" And, "To what extent do
you think safety has been compromised at your facility as a result of the cutbacks?" He asked,
"Are you saying that when people say they want lower taxes, maybe they don't think about what
happens to their parks?" Finally, he took a jab at Congress, "Do you think Congress, the people
on Capitol Hill, have any true appreciation of the dire straits the parks are in?"<p>

On the May 27 World News Tonight, ABC's Tom Foreman brought some reason to the process. He
observed that while visitors to the parks have been increasing, "It is worth noting the National
Parks have been spared some of the major budget cuts...This year the park budget actually went
up $4 million. No wonder some in Congress feel the park service is crying wolf."<p>


<h3>Skip the Other Side</h3><p>

"A balanced report, in some cases, may no longer be the most effective or even the most
informative. Indeed, it can be debilitating. Can we afford to wait for our audience to come to
its conclusions? I think not." Apparently this policy, written six years ago by CNN producer
Teya Ryan, continues today. <p>

On the May 8 The World Today, anchor Linden Soles scared viewers: "It's elementary. We need to
breathe to stay alive. But what if the air is so dirty it could kill you? That's what happens to
tens of thousands of Americans each year, according to a new report. It comes as environmental
regulations are under fire in Congress." Reporter Skip Loescher opened: "Depending on where you
live and your medical condition stepping out for a little fresh air may not be a good idea. In
fact, according to a new report what's in the air we breathe may be prematurely killing us."
Loescher offered soundbites from a press conference by the Natural Resources Defense Council,
the author of the new report. David Hawkins, from the NRDC claimed 64,000 prematurely died from
heart and lung disease brought on by particulate air pollution. Acting like an NRDC spokesman,
Loescher simply lifted numbers from the report. "The number of premature deaths in some cities
is startling. In Los Angeles, for example, the report cites more than 5,800. More than 400 early
deaths are estimated in New York..." Nowhere did Loescher offer an opposing side to counter the
NRDC claims.<p>


<h3>Reinventing Mathematics</h3><p>

Part of the Clinton Administration's attempt to paint itself as moderate involves "reinventing
government," fostering the idea that they are making government smaller. Peter Jennings played
along on the May 14 World News Tonight. He delivered this finger wag to anti-government folks:
"There are a couple of things about government which may surprise you. The federal government is
only about three percent larger than it was more than thirty years ago. And the number of
federal employees is about the same as it was in the 1950s." <p>

Office of Management and Budget (OMB) figures for federal employees have indeed been relatively
stable at around 2 million over the last thirty years. But in the February American Spectator,
Byron York pointed out that most of the Clinton-era cuts were from a Cold War drawdown begun by
the Bush Administration and the closing of the Resolution Trust Corporation: "Add up just those
two areas-Defense and the RTC-and you get 140,800 jobs, or 90 percent of the cuts claimed by
Clinton and Gore. That means the administration has cut a grand total of 16,000 jobs -- less
than one percent of the workforce." The actual scope and power of the federal government is
measured most directly by the federal spending level. According to Edwin Rubenstein's The Right
Data, OMB figures showed federal spending grew 173 percent in real terms between 1965 and 1992.
Hardly the benign "three percent larger" federal government of Jennings' imagination. <p>


<h3>Israel's Gingrich?--Defining Fear and Extremism</h3><p>


An upset election occurs, turning the media conventional wisdom on its head as a conservative
politician wins. The media dismiss the win as unsubstantive, the product of fear and angry white
men. They throw terms like "hardliner" and "right-winger" at the winner and accuse him of
inspiring violence with his rhetoric.<p>

In 1994, the target of this media barrage was Newt Gingrich. In 1996 it was Israel's new Prime
Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Prior to the vote, on the May 27 CBS This Morning, Jesse Schulman
set up the choice: "Shimon Peres, statesman of the old school...talking about the big picture,
about Israel's place in a changing Middle East, about hopes for peace, versus Benjamin
Netanyahu, the slickest TV politician in the business, master of the soundbite, master of the
cheap shot."<p>

Others picked up on Netanyahu's American conservative connections. That night, NBC's Martin
Fletcher tried some guilt by association: "[Netanyahu] has American politician written all over
his campaign. That's thanks to an American political consultant, who has advised conservatives
like Senator Al D'Amato and Jesse Helms. The consultant told Netanyahu to stick to one simple,
negative theme: fear."<p>

The media stuck to a simple message, increasingly invoking the fear theme as the returns became
clearer. Good Morning America anchor Charlie Gibson made the charge on the May 30 broadcast:
"Yesterday's watershed vote, so important to the peace process in the Middle East, has been
called a choice between Israel's hopes and fears, and it now appears, though the results are
still oh so close, that Israel may have voted its fears. Benjamin Netanyahu, who vowed to apply
brakes to the peace process, if not reverse it entirely, is ahead in the vote count."<p>

Later on the same show, New York Times reporter Judith Miller declared that "it was both a
victory for the forces of fear and militancy." Just like Newt Gingrich in 1994, Bibi Netanyahu
was accused of running a campaign not on important issues but on base emotions. <p>

In 1995, Gingrich and House Republicans were accused of inspiring the Oklahoma City bombing. In
1996, Netanyahu was charged with creating the environment for Yitzhak Rabin's assassination. On
the May 31 CBS This Morning, Harry Smith asked Middle East analyst Fouad Ajami: "Let's talk
about his words for a second. Because it's not that many months ago that a lot of people were
accusing Bibi Netanyahu of fanning the flames of the Israeli right, of setting the rhetorical
tone for Rabin's assassination."<p>

Netanyahu, like Gingrich, was subjected to extreme labeling, but their opponents, Peres and the
Democrats, were almost never tagged left wing, extreme or radical. On the May 30 CBS Evening
News, Dan Rather suggested "Serious questions about the future of Middle East peace as Lebanese
terrorists attack an Israeli army convoy and the Israeli government appears headed for a major
shift to the hardline right." The next night he announced, "Right-wing hardliner Benjamin
Netanyahu is declared Israel's new Prime Minister."<p>

On Today May 31, NBC's Ron Allen worried: "The transition seems already underway. This morning
Netanyahu continued talks that could create the most right-wing Orthodox religious government
here ever. During the count, Netanyahu has been silent, leaving aides to offer reassurances that
nothing radical is about to happen."  <p>

<h2>Stand for More Money--Media Promote Liberal Rally</h2><p>


Liberal advocates of increased welfare spending used kids to advance their own interests through
the Children's Defense Fund's (CDF) June 1 Stand for Children march. And the media bought the
facade. Time set the tone with a June 3 story headlined "The Children's Crusade: A '60s style
campaign aims to put kids first in this year's budget battles and the presidential race."
Elizabeth Gleick managed to squeeze only two conservatives into five pages as she painted the
CDF as a group working to fix the "disconnect between what Americans say they want for children
and what they actually do for them." Joan Lunden endorsed the message of organizer Marian Wright
Edelman during a May 30 Good Morning America interview: "It seems like there's more money being
spent for the environment or for the gun lobby...the federal government's talking about turning
over a lot of the social programs to the states...What do you think is the best way to approach
this?" As Edelman responded, "The first thing is we've got to make a commitment," Lunden chimed
in "Yeah, yeah." Edelman then charged that march sponsors "will no longer tolerate the neglect
and abandonment of our children or the massive budget cuts or the dismantlement of the safety
net." To which Lunden gushed: "Gotta get the message out there and get people to rally around
one of our most important problems." Even pieces that included a conservative view still spun
for the marchers. On the May 30 CBS Evening News, Wyatt Andrews talked to kids at a teen center,
noting "the fear they express and the troubling state of kids in general is the reason" for the
march. "A massive rally for children sounds like one of the least controversial ideas in
history, and yet conservative critics believe this march is just a backdrop masking a liberal
agenda." After a clip of the Heritage Foundation's Robert Rector, he showed a teen saying "I
don't want our future to be messed up. I want to, like, have a nice environment and live
peacefully." NBC's John Palmer concluded his June 1 Nightly News story with the marcher's spin:
"As the rally ended, parents were urged to go back home and fight for increased public funding
for programs that help children and to carry the message that children should come first."  <p>

<h2>The Dick Morris Echo Chamber--Reporters Pile "Extremist" Labels on Republicans, But Spared
Democrats in 1993 and 1994</h2><p>

At the dawn of the Clinton era, the Democratic Party dominated both the executive and
legislative branches. Within months, Democrats peeled away  restrictions on abortion on demand,
pushed for openly gay soldiers in the military, raised taxes to historically high levels, and
promoted universally subsidized health care. Two years later, in the gloomy days after the
Republican sweep of Congress in 1994, Bill Clinton sought the advice of political consultant
Dick Morris, who urged him to "triangulate" between the extremes of the ascendant conservative
Republicans and the liberals in his own party. Would reporters label liberal Democrats
"extreme"? To analyze the media's use of labels to describe the political parties, MediaWatch
analysts used the Nexis news data retrieval system to search for the word "extreme" within 25
words of "Republican" or "Democrat" in the three news magazines (Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News &
World Report) and USA Today from January 1, 1993 to May 31, 1996. Analysts discovered reporters
did not use many extremist labels in 1993 and 1994 -- 41 -- but 26 of those were applied to
Republicans, compared to ten mentions of dual extremes and only five for the Democrats who ruled
both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. But in the first 17 months of GOP control, Republicans were
described as "extreme" in 123 stories, while only 15 found "extremes" on both sides. Just two
mentioned "extreme" Democrats. USA Today's Richard Benedetto exemplified reporting on Republican
extremism on June 16, 1995: "Democrats are trying to keep a stiff upper lip as they continue to
oppose `extreme' GOP cuts." Many of these were attributed to Democrats, but more than 20 came
directly from reporters, such as Gloria Borger's March 11, 1996 U.S. News suggestion that
"taking on Buchananism would be good for Gingrich. Recall that until Buchanan surged, Gingrich
was Washington's resident extremist." The reports citing dual extremes weren't always perfectly
balanced. Witness U.S. News's Kenneth Walsh on July 31, 1995: "The President is trying to
position himself as a moderate who occupies a middle ground between liberal Democrats and
ultraconservative Republicans." A rare extreme label for Democrats came in the August 22, 1994
Newsweek, when Joe Klein hit the Clintons: "This President -- and more to the point -- the First
Lady have cultivated the most extreme Democratic health-care cultists and boycotted the
moderates of both parties." The breakdown by publication: USA Today described Republicans with
extreme terms in 14 news stories in 1993 and 1994, compared to five on dual extremes and two
touching on Democrats. More common was  Richard Benedetto on June 27, 1994: "Some analysts warn
the growing strength of conservative Christians in the GOP, and their reputation for
intolerance, will drive moderates and independents to the Democrats, and cause selection of an
extremist 1996 presidential candidate who can't win."<p>
 USA Today tossed in 62 mentions of GOP extremism in 1995-96, seven of dual extremes, and one on
 Democrats. Judy Keen and Bill Nichols found just one extreme on March 16, 1995: "Clinton wants
 to steer a middle course between traditional Democratic liberalism and `extremist' GOP budget
 cut proposals." The duo explained this "middle course" involved "using the broad theme that the
 GOP agenda is extremist, callous toward children and the poor, and cuts government more than
 the nation will tolerate."<p>
U.S. News & World Report contained four mentions of Republican extremism, three of dual
extremes, and one of Democratic extremism in 1993-94; but in 1995-96, U.S. News led the
magazines with 28 GOP extremist labels, two mentions of dual extremes and just one Democrat
extreme. Kenneth Walsh claimed on March 25, 1996: "Clinton's feuds with some allies will make it
harder to label him a liberal extremist, as George Bush in 1988 caricatured Michael Dukakis." On
October 27, 1995, Walsh happily noted: "President Clinton, playing Horatius at the bridge
against the Republican hordes, is finally winning some favorable reviews. Democrats are rallying
to his side as he defends the poor and elderly against GOP `extremism.'" Time carried five
mentions of Republican extremism, and zero mentions of dual or Democratic extremes in 1993-94,
but forwarded 21 mentions of Republican extremism in 1995-96, compared to three mentions of dual
extremes and zero of Democratic extremism. A typical mention was Robert Hughes arguing in an
August 7, 1995 cover story that to Republicans, PBS was "a carcass they can toss to their
extreme right." Newsweek was the least tilted in 1993-94, with three mentions of GOP extremism,
two of dual extremes, two of Democrats: one came in Klein's story quoted above, the other  a
Sharon Begley mention of a professional protest group called BEIRUT (Boisterous Extremists for
Insurrection Against Republicans and Other Unprincipled Thugs). But in 1995-96, the magazine
employed 22 references to GOP extremism, three mentions of dual extremes, and no example of
Democratic extremism.     Howard Fineman tapdanced around associating Republicans with Timothy
McVeigh on May 8, 1995: "the Oklahoma bombing has illuminated a once dark landscape much farther
afield: a radical fringe of militant gun owners, `hate radio' talk-show hosts, racial
extremists, and religious cultists. Their numbers are small -- and their GOP ties tenuous at
best. But their fervor is influential at the grass roots Republicans call their own." Joe Klein
cheered on November 13: "[Colin] Powell has done a great national service by confounding the
extremist publicists and fundraisers of the Republican right." On CNBC's Tim Russert May 25,
Time's Jeffrey Birnbaum told of an adversary relationship with the White House, which saw
reporters as a group "that was there to be manipulated....the conduit for their talking points."
That's all too accurate. The evidence shows reporters aren't stenographers for the White House
-- they're stenographers for White House political consultant. Klein's January 30, 1995 column
didn't count: "[House Minority Whip David] Bonior's reputation of extreme decency and hard work
has saved him."What didn't count was Gloria Borger's April 11, 1994 plaint about White House
inquiries into the hiring of Republican prosecutor Jay Stephens to investigate Whitewater: "It
has swung from a stubborn refusal to disclose to the current extreme of apologizing for
perfectly appropriate behavior."  At least Richard Stengel more evenly presented dual extremes
on February 5, 1996, saying the "triangulation" strategy of "steering between the extremes of
the House Republicans and the liberals in Clinton's own party -- has had the counterintuitive
effect of making Clinton seem like a 'conviction politician.'" On December 19, 1994, Newsweek's
Lucy Howard and Carla Koehl did note an accusation of liberal extremism in the Republican Party,
quoting a flier distributed by "conservative activists" warning of Rep. Susan Molinari's
(R-N.Y.) "extreme pro-abortion agenda," which the reporters immediately followed by noting:
"House sources say that the strident attack angered members, who thought it was unfair." On
November 20, 1995, Joe Klein tried to cast himself in the "radical middle" by scoffing at
Democrats who claimed Colin Powell's refusal to run for President as proof of Republican
extremism: "The witless husk of the party that remains is as intolerant of heresy -- on
abortion, racial gerrymandering, the sanctity of teacher unions -- as any of Pat Robertson's
wing-nuts are." <p>

<center><h2>"Moderates" Vote Left--Democrats Backed Since 1976</center></h2><p>


A survey of his colleagues by a White House correspondent has confirmed that the Freedom Forum
poll, showing 89 percent of Washington reporters voted for Clinton and 50 percent identify
themselves as Democrats, but just four percent as Republicans, matches how they've voted since
1976.<p>

For his new book, Feeding the Beast: The White House Versus the Press, U.S. News & World Report
White House correspondent Kenneth Walsh personally polled 28 of his White House colleagues. His
findings: "In 1992, nine respondents voted for Clinton, two for George Bush, and one for
independent Ross Perot. Three said they had not voted for anyone, and one reporter wrote in the
name of former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas. In 1988, twelve voted for Democrat Michael
Dukakis, only one for Bush, and three did not vote for a presidential candidate. In 1984, ten
voted for Democrat Walter Mondale, no one admitted voting for Ronald Reagan, and four said they
had not voted for a presidential candidate."<p>

In a May 10 appearance on the Fox Morning News Walsh maintained "that the overwhelming number of
reporters" he polled "identify themselves as moderates." Walsh insisted reporters don't have a
liberal bias, "I think it's more just an engine of anti-incumbency." But that's not what his
poll found the last time a Democratic incumbent faced re-election: "In 1980, eight voted for
Democratic incumbent Jimmy Carter, two voted for Ronald Reagan, four voted for independent
candidate John Anderson, and three did not vote. In 1976, eleven voted for Carter and two for
Republican incumbent Gerald Ford."<p>

Walsh's survey included reporters from all the major media: the four TV networks, the Los
Angeles Times, New York Times, USA Today, and The Washington Post; Copley, Cox, Hearst,
Knight-Ridder, plus Newsweek, Time and U.S. News & World Report.  <p>

<h2>MRC-Study from July 1996 Media Watch</h2>
<p>
<h4>Medicare: The Story with 1,060 Errors</h4>
<p>
<dd>The Health Program That Grows by Leaps and Bounds Mysteriously Described 
as "Cut"
<p>
<dd>No subject inspires more  daily journalistic fabrication than the 
federal budget. For the last 15 years, as federal spending mushroomed, 
journalists told a story echoing liberal economist John Kenneth 
Galbraith,  of a squalid public sector starved of its necessary funds. 
No program benefited more from the statist illusions of baseline 
budgeting than Medicare, which reportedly suffered "deep cuts" as it 
expanded -- 72 percent in the Bush years, for example.
<p>
<dd>In the last 18 months, reporters have made Medicare "cuts" an essential 
part of its method of underlining the "extremism" of the Republican 
Congress. The GOP's balanced-budget plan called for a $270 billion 
reduction in projected Medicare increases over seven years (with 
spending per recipient scheduled to increase from $4,800 to $7,100), but 
"cuts" remained the most popular paradigm of reporting.
<p>
<dd>To determine the accuracy of Medicare coverage, MediaWatch analysts 
reviewed 1,134 news stories in three newspapers (The New York Times, The 
Washington Post, USA Today) and three news magazines (Newsweek, Time, 
U.S. News & World Report) from January 1, 1995 to June 30, 1996. 
Employing the Nexis news data retrieval system to secure every news 
mention of "Medicare" within 10 words of "cut," "reduce," "slash," 
"scale back," and "savings," analysts found 1,060 examples of 
journalists describing Medicare "cuts."
<p>
<dd>Analysts counted multiple references within stories, but only references 
to overall Medicare spending growth, and did not include references to 
specifics, such as smaller reimbursements to doctors and hospitals. Also 
omitted were references to "saving" Medicare, which do not refer to 
spending. Analysts did include descriptions that did not match the 
search terms ("gut," "trim," "shrink," "chop," "slice," "curtail").
<p>
<dd> Other less harsh and inaccurate terms were also used. References to 
"savings" were most common, with 439 mentions. "Cuts in the growth" of 
Medicare spending drew 347 uses, and "cuts in projected spending" 
appeared 115 times. But the 901 uses of these terms were outnumbered by 
the 1,060 uses of "cut" variants. In this sample of stories inaccurate 
terminology drew more than half (54 percent) of journalistic 
declarations of Medicare's up-or-down fiscal fate.
<p>
<dd>Even the more accurate terms were garbled reactions to the dominant 
baseline-budgeting news paradigm. After all, how informative is the term 
"savings" when spending will increase by seven percent instead of ten 
percent? "Cuts in growth" and "cuts in projected spending" are 
interesting synonyms for a seven percent increase, especially when these 
terms were modified to sound harsher by reporters: "unreasonably large 
savings," "deep cuts in projected spending," "massive reductions in 
growth." To break it down by publication:
<p>
<dd>In 39 stories, Newsweek contained 24 mentions of "cuts," and only 11 
more accurate terms: five of "savings," five of "cuts in growth," and 
one "cut in projected spending." The January 8, 1996 "Corporate Killers" 
cover story warned: "Congress's budget debate -- and possible cuts in 
programs like Medicare and Medicaid -- feeds fears that the social 
safety net is about to be savaged."
<p>
<dd>Out of 63 stories, Time employed 49 descriptions of "cuts," to 20 uses 
of "cuts in growth," nine of "savings," and two of "cuts in projected 
spending." The May 15, 1995 "The Week" news summary read: "The 
President's strategists were not about to offer Republicans a hand with 
their balanced-budget/tax-cut promises by agreeing to deep slashes in 
Medicare." Richard Lacayo wrote on February 12, 1996 that a flat tax 
"could mean either a higher deficit or even heavier spending cuts in 
such places as Medicare."
<p>
<dd>U.S. News & World Report's 69 stories included 47 "cut" terms to 55 of 
the more accurate terms -- the only source  to tip slightly in 
accuracy's direction. The stories featured 29 references to "cuts in 
growth," 21 to "savings," and five to "cuts in projected spending." A 
March 13, 1995 budget story reported: "Among big-ticket programs, 
Medicare, the health care program for the elderly, and Medicaid, for the 
poor, both came in for major cuts."
<p>
<dd>The New York Times filed 508 stories matching the search terms, with 386 
references to "cuts." Reports of "savings" came on 144 occasions, "cuts 
in growth" on 112, and "cuts in projected spending" on 76. On May 11, 
1995, reporter David Sanger wrote: "But when it came to the details, 
they balked at many of the most extreme cuts, from the deepest slashes 
in Medicare to the elimination of the Commerce Department."
<p>
<dd>On October 27, the Times reported a controversy over its poll question: 
"If you had to choose, would you prefer balancing the budget or 
preventing Medicare from being significantly cut?" Not only did media 
outlets err in news stories, then they erred in their polls and in the 
news stories reporting the poll results.
<p>
<dd>In 256 stories, USA Today carried 157 mentions of "cuts," compared to 63 
of "savings," 56 of "cuts in growth," and 12 of "cuts in projected 
spending." Reporter William M. Welch suggested on May 10, 1995 the 
Republican budget would "make huge cuts in Medicare and Medicaid." 
Despite the 157 boo-boos, USA Today actually printed a correction on 
September 6, 1995: "In its Thursday edition, USA Today incorrectly 
states that Republicans have proposed reducing Medicare spending by $270 
billion. Under the Republican reform proposal to ensure that the program 
remains solvent, Medicare spending over the next seven years increases." 
<p>
<dd>The Washington Post led the survey with 397 uses of "cuts" and its 
variants in 370 stories, contrasted by 197 references to "savings," 125 
to "cuts in growth," and 19 to "cuts in projected spending." An October 
22, 1995 headline charged: "Critics Say Huge Medicare Cut Will Not Heal 
System as GOP Predicts." But the emblematic Post error came in reporter 
Howard Kurtz's attempt to correct a Clinton ad on February 7, 1996: 
"What the ads don't say is that Clinton has also proposed to cut 
Medicare spending, albeit less than the GOP." Kurtz's story, as well as 
the sample as a whole, suggests print reporters are hardly the most 
reliable judges of accuracy, even on the most basic budgetary truths.

<p>
<h4>Slow Out of the Gate on Filegate</h4>
<p>
Networks Criticize Republicans for Aggressive Investigations of 
Wrongdoing
<p>
<dd>After some initial reluctance, the networks eventually picked up the 
news that the White House had improperly obtained FBI files. But instead 
of launching their own investigations, they selectively ran revelations 
uncovered by others.
<p>
<dd>The White House admitted on June 7 collecting FBI reports on 338 GOP 
officials. ABC, CBS and CNN failed to mention the revelation that night. 
NBC's Tom Brokaw did a brief item. ABC aired its first story the next 
day after Bob Dole raised the Watergate comparison. Over on NBC, anchor 
Brian Williams painted Dole as the bad guy: "The politics of Campaign 
'96 are getting very ugly, very early. Today, Bob Dole accused the White 
House of using the FBI to wage war against its political enemies."
<p>
<dd>Three days later only ABC reported that FBI procdures were violated and 
the next day, June 12, ABC and NBC didn't bother noting that President 
Clinton apologized. On June 13 the networks were silent though the 
Senate announced hearings would be held, the FBI began an overhaul of 
procedures, and the New York Post reported that Anthony Marceca, who got 
the files, had ties to Democratic politicians.
<p>
<dd>On June 14 FBI Director Louis Freeh charged the White House with 
"egregious violations of privacy." All four did stories, but the day 
after this critical report that contradict-ed the White House claims, 
only CBS touched the subject.
<p>
<dd>"There's no question that the press initially blew this story," 
Washington Post media reporter Howard Kurtz declared on the June 16 Fox 
News Sunday. Why? There was a "feeling that...a political snooping 
operation was not the kind of thing they expected from the Clinton White 
House, whereas if hundreds of files had been obtained by Ed Meese in the 
Reagan administration on Democrats, I think this story would have 
rocketed to the front page." But that failed to prod his colleagues. No 
network noted that day's Washington Post report that, in contradiction 
to White House claims, the Secret Service said they did not produce the 
list.
<p>
<dd>Instead, CBS painted the Clintons as victims. When the Senate issued its 
June 18 report on its Travel Office investigation, Dan Rather intoned: 
"The more than year-long investigation ended almost the way it began: A 
Republican offensive targeted First Lady Hillary Clinton. Democrats 
claim that it's an all-out election-year political smear-attack."
Weeks later abuses of pow-er still failed to raise concern. The July 6 
Los Angeles Times reported that Marceca "learn-ed from his own 
background file the names of two women who made critical comments about 
him to the FBI. After seeing the file, Marceca sued the two women for 
defamation." Network coverage? Zilch.

<h4>Contract Attacked, But...Families First Favored</h4>
<p>
<dd>NBC doesn't know what to think about the Contract with America's 
political appeal, but in 1994 they denounced its content while providing 
a more favorable forum this year for the Democratic platform.
<p>
<dd>House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt appeared on the June 24 Today to 
discuss his Families First agenda. Katie Couric asked: "Speaker Gingrich 
and company's Contract with America was ultimately rejected by the 
majority of Americans and few people believe it was really behind the 
GOP sweep of the congressional elections in 1994, so why are Democrats 
trying the same approach?"
<p>
<dd>But 45 minutes later reporter Joe Johns had a different view: "The new 
Democratic agenda echoes a successful GOP strategy. In 1994, Republicans 
unveiled the Contract with America, which framed their national agenda 
in the weeks before the elections."
<p>
<dd>Whatever its public appeal, NBC panned the Contract when the Republicans 
unveiled it on September 27, 1994. Anchor Tom Brokaw announced: "GOP 
congressional candidates were summoned to Washington and given a battle 
plan. However, as NBC's Lisa Myers tells us tonight, it is long on 
promises but short on sound premises."
<p>
<dd>Myers lambasted it with five condemnations. After saying it called for 
tax cuts and a balanced budget, Myers charged that "an independent 
budget expert called it standard political bunk." She let a Democrat tag 
it "a big fraud" and then she stated the plan "fell hundreds of billions 
of dollars short of balancing the budget." Myers allowed Gingrich to 
defend the term limits plank, but only to use his response ("I don't 
think you're going to say to everybody who's been here 12 years, `You 
know, this is your last term'") as a foil for her closing sentence: "And 
politicians wonder why voters are cynical."
<p>
<dd>The networks went much easier on the Democrats. On the June 23 CBS 
Evening News John Roberts relayed, without any critical comment: "The 
Families First agenda includes higher paychecks, welfare reform, college 
tuition tax credits, better health care, retirement security and safer 
neighborhoods." A Nightly News piece by NBC's Johns was balanced, saying 
only the proposal was "short on specifics" without attacking any of the 
planks. Gingrich would have appreciated similar treatment.

<H4>Coia and the Mafia</H4>
<P>
<DD>Both Newsweek and Time have filed stories detailing the interesting 
relationship between President Clinton and Arthur Coia, head of the 
Laborers International Union of North America. The Justice Department's 
suspension of a federal takeover of the union coincided with generous 
donations to Clinton from both Coia and the union.
<P>
<DD>Newsweek's Michael Isikoff and Daniel Klaidman were first on the story 
in the May 20 issue, noting the union has given more than $3 million to 
the Democrats since 1991. The June 24 Time story by reporter George 
Church suggested the relationship seemed to pay off for Coia: "After 
three months of negotiations, however, the Justice Department persuaded 
the union to sign a consent decree acknowledging Mob influence and 
conceding to court-appointed officers. But the department agreed to hold 
off filing the decree...The deal left Coia on the job even though the 
original complaint described him as `associated with and controlled and 
influenced by organized-crime figures.' Those are documentable 
facts...Did Justice make a deal because of Coia's White House 
connections?" Church added: "The unprecedented agreement dismayed some 
investigators in the field, who had spent years building the case 
against the union."
<P>
<DD>Church also noted: "Though there is no evidence of a White 
House-engineered fix, the laborers' lavish donations to the Democratic 
Party and Coia's frequent appearances at the White House -- as well as 
deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes' past life as a lawyer for the 
Laborers -- may hand the Republicans a campaign issue."

<h2>Revolving Door, from the July 1996 Media Watch</h2>
<p>
<h4>Chancellor's Last Spin</h4>
<p>
<dd>On July 12 NBC News veteran John Chancellor, who anchored NBC Nightly 
News from 1970 to 1982, passed away at age 68. For two years during the 
Johnson administration, Chancellor served as Director of the Voice of 
America. His death generated a series of tributes to his fairness and 
impartiality from his media colleagues.
<p>
<dd>On the July 13 NBC Nightly News, for instance, anchor Brian Williams 
observed of the man who delivered commentary until his 1993 retirement: 
"He was a role model for all who care about truth, justice and fairness. 
John Chancellor died last night of cancer, two days short of his 69th 
birthday. He helped define what TV news should be." Washington Post 
reporter Howard Kurtz recalled that Chancellor "called himself a man of 
the `extreme center.'"
<p>
<dd>"He dealt in facts," asserted former NBC News President Michael Gartner 
in a July 16 USA Today column. "For his last ten years at NBC, he 
delivered 90-second commentaries three nights a week....At dinner one 
night, I remarked that he got more facts into 90 seconds than we could 
get into the rest of Nightly News in 21 minutes."  Here's a look at some 
of those "fact"-based commentaries:
<p>
<dd>April 17, 1990: "The overall tax burden for Americans, federal, state, 
and local, is actually quite low....The fact is Americans could pay more 
taxes and the country wouldn't go down the tube. Taxpayers don't believe 
this because they are being conned by the politicians...The truth is 
that the United States needs higher taxes and can afford them. Some 
political leaders are now starting to say that, but until more say it, 
the country will remain in trouble."
<p>
<dd>November 20, 1990: "Some say Ronald Reagan won the Cold War by spending 
so much on defense that the Kremlin went bankrupt trying to keep up. 
That won't wash. During Reagan's presidency the United States itself 
became a bankrupt country."
<p>
<dd>August 21, 1991, on the Soviet Union: "It's short of soap, so there are 
lice in hospitals. It's short of pantyhose, so women's legs go bare. 
It's short snowsuits, so babies stay home in winter....The problem isn't 
communism; nobody even talked about communism this week. The problem is 
shortages."
<p>
<dd>April 30, 1992, after the riots in Los Angeles: "It's not a big surprise 
that the jury in suburban Simi Valley sided with the white policemen. 
Just as it's no surprise that the blacks in downtown Los Angeles rioted 
and people died....Politicians have fanned these flames with code words 
about `welfare queens,' `equal opportunity,' and `quotas.' Language 
designed to turn whites against blacks. With two-party politics that 
favored the rich and hurt everyone else."
<p>
<dd>March 12, 1992, a year after the Gulf War: "Greenpeace, the public 
interest organization, believes that the Iraqi death toll, civilian and 
military, before and after the war, may be as high as 198,000. Allied 
military dead are counted in the low hundreds. The disparity is huge and 
somewhat embarrassing. And that's commentary for this evening, Tom."
Election night, 1992, looking back at the Republican convention: "I 
think that the convention -- and certainly all the polling data 
indicates this -- offended a lot of women, offended a lot of people in 
the country who thought it was too religious and too hard-edged."

<h2>News Bites, from the July 1996 Media Watch</h2>
<p>
<b>Humorless Howard.</b>
<p>
To read Washington Post media writer Howard Kurtz, one might think Bill 
Clinton was some poor fat kid getting ridiculed on the playground. In a 
June 4 story he claimed Clinton "has drawn a phenomenal amount of 
personal ridicule" from comedians, "Unflattering images -- of a 
philandering, draft-dodging, pot-smoking, cheeseburger-chomp-ing, 
self-indulgent finagler -- reverberate through the media." And 
"Republicans have concluded that barbed humor can be a particularly 
sharp weapon." Unfortunately, Kurtz did not quantify his feelings by 
consulting experts. On June 24, the Center for Media and Public Affairs 
released the results of its study detailing jokes told by David 
Letterman, Jay Leno, and Conan O'Brien. Since the end of the primaries, 
"the latenight comics have told twice as many jokes about Dole as they 
have about Clinton."
<p>
<b>Richer Under Clinton.</b>
<p>
The June 20 New York Times headline declared: "Income Disparity Between 
Poorest and Richest Rises." Reporter Steven Holmes relayed a Census 
Bureau finding that "during the first two years" of Clinton, "the share 
of national income earned by the top 5 percent of householdsgrew at a 
faster rate than during the eight years of the Reagan administration, 
which was often characterized as favoring the rich."
Where were the networks? On March 5, 1992, when the Times ran a similar 
piece, CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather announced: "In America in the 
1980s, what former President Reagan and those who support him call the 
Reagan Revolution put more money in the pockets of the rich. We already 
knew that. But a new study indicates that those who did best of all by 
far were the very richest of the rich." This time CBS was silent, as 
were ABC and CNN. The news made the June 20 NBC Nightly News, but anchor 
Brian Williams didn't blame Clinton, but corporate America: "Much of the 
blame for the income gap has been laid on vast changes in the job 
market, a job market that keeps shrinking. A while back corporate 
f pumping the story up."
<p>
<b>The Invisible McDougals.</b>
<p>
Two recent morning show interviewers demonstrated the convictions of the 
President's Whitewater business partners on multiple felony counts 
hasn't changed the media's tune. On the June 5 Good Morning America, 
ABC's Elizabeth Vargas interviewed Michael Chertoff, Republican Counsel 
to the Whitewater investigation. She inquired: "It would seem very 
natural that Hillary Clinton's fingerprints would be on her own billing 
records. Is this at all significant?" Throughout the interview Vargas 
sounded like a White House flack: "But, Mr. Chertoff, Mrs. Clinton 
freely admits she examined those documents back in 1992. How do you know 
these prints aren't several years old?"
<p>
CBS This Morning substitute host Erin Moriarty spent three straight days 
using the White House spin to challenge guests on June 18-20. 
Questioning  Rep. Susan Molinari (R-N.Y.), Democratic activist Lynn 
Cutler, and David Maraniss of The Washington Post, Moriarty asked 
nothing but pro-Clinton questions. She asked Molinari: "But let's be 
honest here. I mean, this is an election year. How much of this, as the 
White House of course says, is just a matter of the Republicans piling 
on in a presidential election year?" She asked Maraniss: "We're talking 
about transactions that occurred a decade ago. I mean, can't some of 
this just be simply forgetfulness?" The next day, Moriarty tried to 
dismiss Filegate in a question to Rep. William Clinger (R-Pa.): "Are you 
concerned that this will mean a number of redundant investigations into 
the same matter?"
<p>
Schneider's Wishful Thinking.On the June 14 Inside Politics, CNN polling 
analyst Bill Schneider trumpeted,  as the death knell of conservative 
activism, Virginia Sen. John Warner's decisive win over Jim Miller in a 
GOP primary: "This week the voters struck a resounding blow against 
political correctness --  not political correctness of the left, 
political correctness of the right." Schneider reported Warner took 
"moderate positions on abortion and gun control" and "refused to support 
radical right nominees of his own party, like Oliver North in 1994 and 
former Moral Majority official Mike Farris in 1993."
<p>
According to Schneider, activists representing term limits, gun owners 
and Christian conservatives were rejected by even the Republican 
faithful in Virginia. "Warner didn't just beat Miller, he wiped the 
floor with him. Warner won everywhere, even in solidly Republican 
areas...the Republican mainstream turned out to vote against him 
[Miller]."
<p>
Schneider charged conservatives were on a losing streak. "This 
represents the third defeat in a row for the right wing in Virginia. 
They couldn't win general elections in 1993 and 1994." He forgot the GOP 
made big gains in the state legislature in 1995 and elected conservative 
Gov. George Allen in 1993. Schneider also failed to mention the actual 
tone of Warner's TV ads. Some attacked Miller from the right, while 
others pitched Warner as a conservative: "Committed to common sense 
conservative principles like lower taxes, less regulation, and a 
balanced budget."
<p>
<b>It's Our Land of Hackdom Now.</b>
<p>
An article in the June 3 Newsweek by Mark Hosenball and Daniel Klaidman 
showed the Willie Horton defense is already being deployed in Campaign 
'96. Titled "Desperately Seeking the Next `Willie Horton,' the piece 
detailed what Newsweek called "part of a concerted Republican effort to 
build a `Hall of Shame' for prosecutors and judges deemed soft on 
crime...A loose network of former Republican prosecutors is searching 
for liberal jurists and lawyers, the kind who might, say, turn loose 
another Willie Horton."
<p>
Specifically, Newsweek tried to short-circuit Republican criticism of 
Janet Napolitano, a Clinton-appointed U.S. Attorney who had been one of 
Anita Hill's lawyers. Napolitano's office refused to grant a search 
warrant to postal inspectors investigating a child porn ring because she 
had a "`philosophical disagreement' with the sting operation because it 
targeted homosexual males." Oddly, while Hosenball and Klaidman decried 
this injection of politics into criminal justice, they cheered on that 
the "Justice [Department] is learning how to fight back. Using the 
lexicon of the campaign, Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick has told 
aides she wants a `rapid response' to counter charges `in the same news 
cycle.' Gorelick is even setting up a campaign-like `war room' in her 
office. In a campaign year, Justice can't afford to be totally blind."
<p>
This contrasted with Newsweek's attitude in 1992 that "Clinton, for a 
change, should pick an Attorney General who is above politics." In that 
November 23, 1992 article Newsweek's David Kaplan criticized the Justice 
Department under Ed Meese for being too political: "Meese ran a Justice 
Department that was the Land of Hackdom -- little more than an agency to 
service the needs of President Reagan and, occasionally, of the A.G. 
himself. [Meese's] four-year reign was the archetype of politics over 
conscience, ideology over law."
<p>
<b>Hyping the Hippie.</b>
<p>
When Timothy Leary died on May 31, the media lauded him as a barefoot, 
smiling hippie who spent his life dispensing wisdom and encouraging 
people to open their minds. CBS News reporter Sharyl Attkisson related 
that "the last words of the man who spent a lifetime asking questions 
[were] `Why not?'
<p>
Newsweek's David Gates gave a much more complete portrait of Leary's 
life. Gates reported June 10 that by the end of the '60s, Leary "found 
it `inconceivable' that turned-on parents wouldn't share acid with kids 
as young as 7." In 1970, he broke out of prison with the help of the 
ultra-violent leftist Weather Underground, fleeing to the Black 
Panther's "exile" camp in Algeria. Gates reported that Leary suggested 
it was a "`sacred act' to shoot cops." After being captured in 
Afghanistan, Leary informed on drug buddies to curry favor for a lighter 
sentence.
<p>
<b>Brokaw's Bias Drained Out.</b>
<p>
Why are the media perceived as biased and what are the greatest threats 
to honest information? NBC's Tom Brokaw offered novel answers  during a 
June 11 National Press Club appearance aired on C-SPAN. On bias, Brokaw 
explained: "We're out there on the cutting edge of change on a daily 
basis. That's what news is all about....The people...who are the 
recipients of that news, kind of like the status quo for the most part. 
They're comfortable. They've learned to deal with it and they don't want 
to adapt to the change. Therefore they have to learn to blame someone in 
some regard and they think therefore since we brought them the news of 
the change that somehow we are biased of favor of the change." He 
insisted: "We've worked very hard to drain the bias out of what we do."
<p>
He dismissed talk radio, saying "I think that people pretty soon get 
bored with it...I think that you'll find that a lot of these acts and a 
lot of these towns around the country will begin to dry up because it's 
so Johnny One Note and it's not very enlightening." While "they can 
still stir up an issue from time to time," to Brokaw that's not a good 
thing, it's instead "the price of free speech."
<p>
Talk radio is not the only non-mainstream media source that disturbed 
the NBC anchor: "If you don't go on the net and look at the political 
web sites, then you're missing something, because that's an unfiltered 
access to people out there, and there's some outrageous stuff that is 
going out on the Internet right now -- claims that are being made by 
these special interest groups, all the way across the political 
spectrum, from the far left to the far right." It seems that in Brokaw's 
world, free speech is a threat if he or his colleagues can't control it.

<h2>Janet Cooke Award</h2>
<P>
<H4>Newsweek, ABC Put Best Face on First Lady's White House Talks to the Dead</H4>
<P>
<H4>Poor Joan of Arc Can't Get Private Help</H4>
<P>
<DD>Reporter Bob Woodward promoted his new book The Choice with a colorful 
anecdote of Hillary Clinton, under the guidance of psychic Jean Houston, 
speaking in the White House solarium to Eleanor Roosevelt and Mahatma 
Gandhi. Woodward reported the friendship clicked when Houston said 
Hillary "was reversing thousands of years of expectation, and was there 
upfront, probably more than virtually any woman in human history -- 
apart from Joan of Arc."
<P>
<DD>Reporters at Newsweek and ABC sympathized with the First Lady in 
covering Woodward's psychic scoop. For employing a very different 
approach than their coverage of Nancy Reagan's use of an astrologer, 
Newsweek and ABC earned the Janet Cooke Award.
<P>
<DD>Newsweek Washington Bureau Chief Evan Thomas acknowledged the Nancy 
Reagan parallels of Hillary's psychic friends, but countered critics and 
comedians July 1: "A long-time searcher for spiritual meaning, Mrs. 
Clinton had conjured conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt long before 
she met Dr. Houston. Mrs Clinton is not even the first First Lady to 
dabble in psychics or mediums: the wives of Presidents Abraham Lincoln, 
Ulysses S. Grant, John Tyler, Woodrow Wilson, and Warren G. Harding all 
tried, in one way or another, to communicate beyond the grave. Unlike 
Nancy Reagan, Hillary never tried to use psychic powers to influence her 
husband."
<P>
<DD>Thomas added: "To many women, Hillary Clinton is not a cold-eyed 
conspirator, but a martyr." He quoted Mrs. Clinton's fans at a Boston 
fundraiser for the Clinton campaign saying Hillary's "being bashed by 
the press" because "a lot of people don't like a strong woman." Thomas 
concluded that to these voters, "Hillary looks just the way she does to 
her philosopher friend, Dr. Houston -- as a Joan of Arc figure, 
persecuted for her righteous crusade."
<P>
<DD>If it seems hardly noteworthy for liberal Hillary to be popular in 
Massachusetts, the June 21 Boston Herald's account of the fundraiser 
presented a less than popular figure. Reporter Joe Sciacca quoted a 
Democratic operative: "They couldn't give tickets away. A lot of people 
got [free tickets]. Even the applause lines were off. A lot of people 
are getting concerned." Thomas told MediaWatch: "Our reporter Martha 
Brant was there and saw it first-hand. They certainly were enthusiastic 
Hillary-lovers at this lunch...I don't think the point's negated if they 
had difficulty selling tickets."
<P>
<DD>This is not the spin Newsweek gave the Nancy Reagan story, revealed in 
former chief of staff Don Regan's book For the Record. In the May 16, 
1988 issue, George Hackett and Eleanor Clift did allow Mrs. Reagan's 
press secretary, Elaine Crispen, to ask: "If she could get a little 
comfort and consolation from astrology, why not?" But they also 
forwarded other spins: "Scientists showed less tolerance for the 
President's participation in what they consider medieval superstition. 
`How can you control a science budget of billions of dollars when you 
believe in nonsense of this magnitude?,' says James Kaler, professor of 
astronomy at the University of Illinois." Hackett and Clift added: 
"Criticism also rumbled from fundamentalists, who liken astrology to 
Satan worship. `This is the last straw for a lot of religious people who 
treated Reagan as their political savior,' said conservative columnist 
and former Moral Majority vice president Cal Thomas."
<P>
<DD>Newsweek failed to try these lines of attack on Mrs. Clinton's Methodist 
commitments. (It could have been done: Washington Times reporter Julia 
Duin did interview several disappointed Methodist theologians and 
evangelicals -- and some Methodist defenders -- on June 25). But that 
might have clashed with Newsweek religion reporter Kenneth Woodward's 
October 31, 1994 verdict that "Hillary Rodham Clinton is as pious as she 
is political. Methodism, for her, is not just a church but an extended 
family of faith that defines her horizons." He called the Clinton era 
. Sam Donaldson reports the White House will not take the Regan book 
lying down."
<P>
<DD>Donaldson was straightforward instead of sympathetic, airing both 
critics and supporters: "This new, unflattering portrait of the First 
Family is producing new, often humorous, unfavorable public reaction 
which political opponents are clearly savoring.... Reagan loyalists are 
incensed....Reporters like Helen Thomas are just glad to be informed." 
Donaldson ended: "Presidents and their wives look to their place in 
history and to the Reagans, Regan's book doesn't help."
Both outlets were reasonably fair (if a little jokey) with the Reagans, 
but any damaging tidbit on the Clintons, no matter how trivial, seems to 
inspire an entirely different approach: damage control. Remember when 
reporters used to provoke damage control, not practice it?

<blockquote> 
<h2>Double Standard on Rumor -- Aldrich Canceled by Networks</h2>
<P>
<DD>Under intense questioning on the June 30 This Week with David Brinkley, 
former FBI agent turned author Gary Aldrich backed down on the most 
sensational charge in his book Unlimited Access -- that Bill Clinton 
sneaks out of the White House for trysts. Reporters denounced Aldrich, 
and ABC's Nightline, Dateline NBC, and CNN's Larry King Live canceled 
interviews with him, echoing the White House line that guests meet a 
"bare threshhold of credibility." This is not a standard the networks 
have applied in the past. 
<P>
For example:
<BR>
<DD>Kitty Kelley appeared in three consecutive morning interviews on NBC's 
Today show (April 8-10, 1991) and also on CBS This Morning (April 11). 
Time and Newsweek both put her book on their covers. The New York Times 
put her unproven charges on page one, without any attempt to prove her 
allegations, including the fanciful charge that Nancy Reagan had a 
torrid affair with Frank Sinatra in the White House. Bryant Gumbel began 
NBC's three days of interviews arguing that "Best-selling author Kitty 
Kelley has proven her courage and her credibility with her 
no-holds-barred biographies."
<P>
<DD>Anita Hill drew more than 60 evening news stories in October 1991 on the 
networks before the Senate even began hearings, which featured the live 
airing of Hill's unsubstantiated allegations that Supreme Court nominee 
Clarence Thomas talked about the size of his penis and loved discussing 
films showing humans having sex with animals. On October 7, 1991, Dan 
Rather asked Hill questions like: "Why do you believe this man, Judge 
Thomas, that you have worked closely with for a long time, has not 
spoken directly to what you consider to be the substance of this 
charge?" Joseph and Susan Trento claimed, based solely on the guesswork 
of the late Ambassador Louis Fields, that George Bush had an affair with 
State Department aide Jennifer Fitzgerald. On August 11, 1992, CNN's 
Mary Tillotson was the first to ask Bush about the charge. Dateline NBC 
anchor Stone Phillips asked the President in prime time. ABC's Good 
Morning America and CBS This Morning invited the Trentos on for 
interviews.
<P>
<DD>Newt Gingrich's enemies have insisted that Gingrich showed up at the 
hospital bed of his cancer-stricken first wife Jackie with a notebook to 
discuss divorce terms. That unsubstantiated story has been told by Tom 
Brokaw on Dateline NBC, CNN's Judy Woodruff, and then-CBS star Connie 
Chung.
<P>
<DD>Gary Sick's 2,200-word April 15, 1991 New York Times op-ed jump-started 
the discredited "October Surprise" theory that held the 1980 Reagan 
campaign conspired to delay the release of the Iranian hostages. Sick 
was booked on Nightline (where Ted Koppel called him "serious, 
knowledgeable Gary Sick") and Larry King Live, and the charges drew 27 
evening news stories in 1991.

<h2>Networks Try to Create "Houston II"</h2>
<P>
<H4>Prime-Time Coverage Finds Extremists, Asks Liberal Questions, Obsesses Over Abortion</H4>
<P>
<DD>The shadow of Houston has stubbornly remained a part of the media image 
of the Republican Party. The Texas town's 1992 convention quickly became 
a "feast of hate and fear" in the media lexicon, as the networks heaped 
70 statements or questions about the appropriateness of the alleged 
overly negative tone of the Republicans, compared to zero mentions for 
the Democrats in New York's Madison Square Garden.
<P>
<DD>The 1996 convention in San Diego offered reporters the promise of 
another Houston, a mirror image of the punitive, extremist fiasco 
reporters created out of the last convention. But the moderated tone the 
Republicans sought to project gave reporters few opportunities to create 
new controversy.
<P>
<DD>But the biased pattern of past conventions did repeat itself, if not to 
the same degree as four years ago. In short, during the San Diego 
convention: 
<UL>
<LI><a href="#labeling">(1)</a> Republican delegates, speakers, and candidates were described as conservative more than three times as often as moderate, but also as extreme more often than as moderate; 
<LI><a href="#questions">(2)</a> Reporters and anchors posed more than seven times as many questions from the liberal agenda than from a conservative agenda; and 
<LI><a href="#abortion">(3)</a> controversies, especially the intra-party tussle over abortion, of Republican exclusivity and "intolerance," far outnumbered the coverage of controversies and the exclusion of pro-life speakers at the Democrats' 1992 convention.<P>
</UL>
<DD>During the convention, a team of MediaWatch analysts in both San Diego 
and Alexandria, Virginia watched live prime time coverage offered by the 
five networks. The information appeared in a special daily Media Reality 
Check '96 newsletter. This year's study follows the methodology of 
convention studies in 1984, 1988, and 1992, and covered all ABC, CBS, 
and NBC prime time coverage, as well as the combined PBS/NBC coverage 
and CNN from 8 pm to 11pm Eastern time. In the September issue, 
MediaWatch will publish a comparison of the San Diego coverage with 
coverage of the Democrats in Chicago. 
<P>
<a name="labeling">
<B>Labeling</B>
<P>
<DD>Network reporters followed the usual pattern of convention labeling, 
with 46 conservative (with 16 references to extreme conservatism) to 13 
moderate labels. NBC had only two conservative labels and four moderate 
tags. CBS, with nine references to conservatives and five labels for 
moderates, also came close to balancing the labels. ABC(10-0), CNN 
(16-2), and PBS (9-2) underlined the conservative nature of the party. 
PBS led in the use of extreme labels with six, followed by CNN (4), CBS 
(3), ABC (2) and NBC (1).
<P>
<DD>The amount of labeling declined every night: from 29 on Monday to 14 on 
Tuesday, 11 on Wednesday, and five on Thursday. The label count did not 
include mentions of the party's attempts to woo "moderate voters," and 
also excluded historical references (for example, a reference to a "more 
moderate" Richard Nixon in the 1950s). Some examples of references to 
extremism:
<P>
<DD>Margaret Warner asked Newt Gingrich on PBS Monday night: "The Dole 
campaign officials do say that partly this convention is designed to 
undo the damage done to the Republican image by you and the Republican 
Congress, which fairly or unfairly, the voters seem to see as extreme. 
You've heard all the words. Do you think that's true and does it make 
you feel repudiated at all?"
<P>
<DD>On Tuesday night, CBS reporter Lesley Stahl explained the night about to 
unfold: "The whole purpose of tonight's convention, the whole program is 
to diminish the images of this party as extreme because that's what's 
turning the women off. Four years ago, the main speaker at the 
convention, the Republican convention, was Pat Buchanan. He was yelling, 
his pitchforks were raised. Tonight it will be Colin Powell, he will 
appeal to civility. On the platform, women find that extreme. It's 
turning them off." (The study did not incorporate evening news 
statements, like this one from Dan Rather to Jack Kemp on Monday's CBS 
Evening News: "Even some Republicans describe the current platform as 
quote, `harsh, extreme,' even `radical.' Do you see it that way?")
<P>
<DD>NBC's Tim Russert echoed Stahl the same night: "Key words: mean-spirited 
and extremist. They want to avoid those labels. They have thus far after 
two days and that's why you're not going to see Newt Gingrich in prime 
time tonight...I think the speech by Senator Hutchison of Texas is 
dangerous, Tom, because she uses words that could be interpreted by some 
people as mean."
<P>
<DD>Also on Tuesday came this explanation from CBS veteran Bob Schieffer: 
"The Dole campaign had a very delicate assignment as they see it. They 
want to get the word out to mainstream America that Senator Dole's 
thinking is more in line with that thinking, than perhaps even some of 
these very conservative delegates in this hall."
<P>
<DD>References to Republican moderates often came with a skeptical tone. On 
Tuesday night, CBS reporter Ed Bradley asked a Buchanan delegate: 
"There's been an effort to paint a moderate face to this convention. How 
does this sit with you?"
<P>
<a name="questions">
<B>Agenda Questions</B>
<P>
<DD>When network reporters and analysts weren't dwelling on media images or 
tactical gambits, their questions on the issues came more than seven 
times as often from the liberal agenda as they did from the conservative 
agenda: 51 questions were asked from the left, to just six from the 
right. ABC asked only three liberal agenda questions and no conservative 
ones in four nights. CBS came closest to balancing agenda questions 
(8-3), while NBC (10-1), CNN (10-1), and PBS (20-1) stuck almost 
completely to agenda questions from the left:
<P>
<DD>A number of the questions from the left poured skepticism on the Dole 
tax cut plan. NBC's Maria Shriver asked New Jersey Gov. Christie Todd 
Whitman on Tuesday: "Bill Clinton has said that Bob Dole's proposal for 
the economy would end up crippling the economy, balloon the deficit. Why 
is he wrong?" She added: "Governor, are you not all concerned about what 
happens to the federal deficit, which is a major, major concern for most 
of the delegates at this convention, based on the polling that we've 
done, if Bob Dole is able to put into effect his 15 percent tax cut?"
<P>
<DD>On Monday night, Tom Brokaw asked Gov. Pete Wilson: "But why should the 
children of illegal immigrants be penalized, as the language in the 
platform indicates they will be, especially those who become citizens if 
they're born here, even if they're born to illegal immigrants?"
<P>
<DD>On CNN, Bob Franken asked conservative evangelist Jerry Falwell Monday 
night about HIV-positive Republican activist Mary Fisher's speech: "Many 
of the AIDS activists would claim that part of the problem they have is 
the attitude toward AIDS victims among fundamentalists, among 
conservatives like yourself. How do you respond to that?" He added: "But 
you are aware that many in the gay community feel that it is hostility 
from people like your followers that contributes to the problems they 
have."
<P>
<DD>On Wednesday night, after paralyzed former police officer Steve McDonald 
addressed the delegates, Franken pointedly interviewed National Rifle 
Association chief Wayne LaPierre: "I'm going to ask you is here you have 
a policeman who was shot in the line of duty with weapons and...the 
criticism of your organization is that it's because of you those weapons 
are so readily available....Here we have a policeman who was shot by 
weapons that might not have been out there, the critics say, were it not 
for the NRA."
<P>
<DD>There were a few examples of conservative agenda questions, like Bob 
Schieffer's Tuesday question to Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison: "You 
talked a lot about Bill Clinton's broken promises. What promise do you 
think -- I know Republicans are trying to bring women into the big tent 
-- what promise has he made or broken, in your view, that has hurt women 
the most?"
<P>
<DD>That night, Dan Rather asked Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson: 
"Now the main speaker tonight, as was the case for the main speaker last 
night, is pro-choice. How mad does that make you?"
<P>
<a name="abortion">
<B>Controversy:  Abortion</B>
<P>
<DD>Peter Jennings suggested in the August 12 San Diego Union-Tribune: 
"Whenever a political party goes out of its way to restrain, isolate, or 
box in other voices -- and both parties do it -- then you almost 
invariably attract the attention of journalists." But Jennings and the 
rest of ABC, as well as CBS, in 1992 ignored the Democrats' decision to 
refuse Pennsylvania Gov. Bob Casey an opportunity to state his pro-life 
views from the Madison Square Garden convention podium. NBC interviewed 
Casey once. CNN also interviewed him once, and mentioned the controversy 
on four other occasions.
<P>
<DD>In San Diego, the networks drove home the controversy within the 
Republican Party over abortion: reporters, anchors, and analysts 
referred to the party's split over the issue -- including platform 
disagreements and Gov. Pete Wilson's "disinvitation" to speak -- on 55 
occasions. The emphasis on the abortion controversy was mostly contained 
to the first two nights -- 21 mentions on Monday night, 25 on Tuesday, 
and then only eight on Wednesday night and one on Thursday. CNN (with 18 
mentions) dwelled on the controversy the most, followed by PBS (13), CBS 
(12), ABC (8), and NBC (4).
<P>
<DD>On Monday night, NBC's Tom Brokaw stressed: "But so far the indication 
is that these people, who want to encourage a more tolerant, moderate 
attitude toward abortion have been denied the right to speak. Their 
Republican credentials are impeccable, and they're going everywhere and 
complaining that they're not going to be allowed in this hall." Minutes 
later, he added: "What you will not see at this podium -- the Governor 
of the host state, Pete Wilson. He's not going to be allowed to speak 
because he has some views on abortion that the Dole campaign would not 
rather have expressed here, and also William Weld, the Governor of 
Massachusetts."
<P>
<DD>On Tuesday, CNN's Bernard Shaw suggested: "Bob Dole did not get the 
tolerance lanugage he wanted in the abortion plank which came out of 
this platform committee earlier in the week. He didn't get a few other 
things. The conservatives have ironclad control over this convention, 
but he did get the opportunity to have some people who are pro-choice 
speak before this convention tonight, one of them Susan Molinari."
<P>
<DD>CBS reporter Lesley Stahl took on the controversy from the pro-life side 
of the fence on Wednesday before labeling it extreme: "We're hearing a 
lot of grousing about the repackaging of the party...In gagging 
opponents of abortion, affirmative action, those kinds of issues, Bob 
Dole may be turning off the very people he needs to leave the convention 
gung-ho. They say putting three pro-choice women on last night was too 
much. But Bob Dole has a dilemma: In order to win, he does have to 
change the perception of this party as too extreme."
<P>
<DD>(The study did not include evening news statements, like Peter Jennings' 
oration on the Tuesday World News Tonight: "The right to abortion has 
never been an overwhelming issue for women at election time. But this 
fight within the Republican Party has many Republican women questioning 
how far this party is willing to go to limit their rights.")
<P>
<DD>The convention week focus on abortion was only a small part of the 
network attention this year to the GOP abortion plank. Just during the 
Sunday morning interview shows on August 11, the networks asked 27 
questions about exclusion of pro-abortion Republicans. Eleven questions 
were posed on CNN's Late Edition, compared to nine on NBC's Meet the 
Press, four on ABC's This Week with David Brinkley, and three on CBS's 
Face the Nation.
<P>
<DD>From April 30, when four "moderate" governors declared they would 
challenge the party's pro-life plank, to August 9, ABC, CBS, and NBC 
preferred beating on the Republican side of the story by 60 to 1. The 
networks aired 30 full stories on the evening newscasts, compared to 
only one ABC story on the Democrats. The morning shows aired 30 full 
stories or interview segments on the GOP debate, to nothing about the 
Democrats. (That doesn't include five anchor briefs on the evening shows 
and 34 on the morning shows).
<P>
<DD>CNN's evening newscast The World Today aired seven full stories and ten 
anchor briefs on the GOP pro-life plank, to only one anchor brief on the 
Democrats. CNN's Inside Politics, a show favored by political junkies, 
aired 38 full stories or interview segments on the GOP to two segments 
on the Democrats. The Democrats held platform hearings on July 10 and 
11, and finished on August 5 -- with almost no media attention.

<H2>Ross Takes on the Boss </H2> 
ABC's Brian Ross filed stories during the GOP conclave on corporate  
money lavished on the GOP, but his August 15 World News Tonight report  
looked at a surpising target:

<blockquote>"Very much in the middle of the mix are the giant media corporations,  
like CNN, whose multi-million-dollar merger has yet to be formally  
approved by federal regulators. Time Warner gave more than $100,000 to  
be an official sponsor of the convention." Former Los Angeles Times  
reporter Dwight Morris told Ross media companies shouldn't use the  
conventions to lobby, and Ross noted: "But that didn't stop CBS lobby  
ists from giving the Republicans thousands of dollars to help pay for  
the cost of food and liquor in the skybox belonging to Republican Party  
Chairman Haley Barbour."</blockquote>

<DD>Ross even reported on his own bosses: "Last night, the ABC hospitality  
suite was a lobbyist's dream. With visits from Congressman Tom Bliley,  
the chairman of the House Commerce Committee, which handles  
telecommunications issues. And then from the number two man in the  
House, Majority Leader Dick Armey, who could be seen with top ABC  
executives, including the ABC lobbyist, who insisted he wasn't  
lobbying."

<DD>The Friday before the Democrats convened Ross reported "a labor union  
under federal investigation for its ties to the mafia"  contributed at  
least $250,000 to the party.

<H2>News Bites from Media Watch</H2>
<P>
<BR>
<H4>Unconcerned About Rape.</H4>
<P>
<DD> Just after rape victim Jan Licence addressed the Republican convention  
on victims' rights on August 13, NBC's Maria Shriver seemed baffled.  
During combined PBS/NBC coverage Shriver posed to her this question:  
"But why [speak out] at a Republican convention? So many people have  
said that they don't think this ticket, or perhaps this party, is  
supportive of women's issues. Why make this stand here?"
<DD>Later, during NBC's prime time broadcast, Tom Brokaw interviewed Licence  
and asked: "Do you think -- this is a party that is dominated by men and  
this convention is dominated by men as well...Do you think before  
tonight they thought very much about what happens in America with rape?"
<P>
<H4>Gumbel Scoldings.</H4>
<P>
<DD>To keep "out what officials call the biased liberal media," the RNC  
launched GOP-TV to provide complete convention coverage, NBC's Bob Faw  
reported on the August 13 Today. Faw asserted: "What GOP-TV calls  
unfiltered, doesn't even begin to pay lip service to balance or  
fairness." NBC should know. 
<DD>Here's how Bryant Gumbel opened that morning's Today: "Good morning.  
Retired General Colin Powell, a new recruit to the GOP cause, addressed  
the delegates in San Diego last night, drawing cheers with accounts of  
why he became a Republican and why he'll vote for Bob Dole. But although  
his speech was generally well-received, the reception was restrained,  
and there were boos whenever Powell steered away from the right. Though  
they booed and also heckled dissent, Republicans claimed the mantle of  
inclusion throughout the first night of their convention. We can expect  
more of the same today, Tuesday, August 13, 1996." 
<DD>Guess which network scares journalists? Faw reported that "Jonathan  
Alter of Newsweek thinks GOP-TV has started something deceptive and  
unwholesome." Alter explained: "It is political propaganda, masquerading  
as news, and that's a problem." Political propaganda masquerading as  
news? Sounds like Bryant Gumbel.
<P>
<H4>It's the Republican's Fault.</H4>
<P>
<DD>Calling conservatives "extremists" and lying about budget "cuts" have  
been Democratic mantra, but two networks blamed the GOP for getting  
nasty. NBC's Maria Shriver asked Dole California campaign chairman Ken  
Khachigian on August 14: "You said coming out of this campaign, Clinton  
is going to have 80 days of hell, that we are going to take Clinton down  
in California, that we are going to take him down hard. How ugly is this  
going to get?"
<DD>About 20 minutes after Bob Dole completed his acceptance speech, CNN  
anchor Bernard Shaw discovered the beginning of a nasty campaign: "I've  
maintained that this campaign is going to be one of the nastiest,  
bare-knuckled, direct-to-the-gut campaigns in America's political  
history. Listen to this one sentence, quote `It is demeaning to the  
nation that within the Clinton administration a core of the elite never  
grew up, never did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered and  
never learned, should have the power to fund with your earnings their  
dubious and self-serving schemes.'" 
<P>
<H4>Decrying Clinton Criticism.</H4>
<P>
<DD>Journalistic sensitivity to any attacks on Bill Clinton quickly came  
through loud and clear the morning after U.S. Rep. Susan Molinari and  
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchision spoke. "GOP Unleashes An Attack On Clinton  
Over Character and His Economic Policies," charged a New York Times  
headline. "Congresswoman Susan Molinari took on the role of attack dog  
last night, using her keynote address to attack the President," Bryant  
Gumbel began the August 14 Today.
<DD>NBC's morning crew stuck to the Democratic line in their questions.  
Gumbel asked Tim Russert: "There's an old adage that says what you do  
speaks so loudly I can't hear what you say. Republicans are speaking  
tolerance and diversity. Are you seeing any evidence of it or quite the  
contrary?" Katie Couric inquired of Republican strategist Charles Black:  
"Chris Dodd of the DNC says this is a huge con game. That the way you're  
portraying the party as this moderate inclusive party just doesn't gibe  
with say, the platform, and some of the attitudes of members of the GOP.  
How do you address that?" 
<DD>Over on Good Morning America, news anchor Elizabeth Vargas asserted:  
"Some of the harshest words were from Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,  
who tried to paint the President as a tax and spend liberal." Co-host  
Charles Gibson added: "Polls will tell you these days that people do not  
want much partisanship in their politics, but they got it at the  
Republican convention last night. There were attacks on President  
Clinton's credibility, integrity, even his eating habits." ABC's Vargas  
didn't shy away from stereotyping: "But in addition to a gender gap,  
Republicans have had problems attracting minorities, a party that has  
traditionally been home to the angry white man."
<P>
<H4>Gutless Moderates? </H4>
<P>
<DD>If only the moderates were more aggressive then conservatives could be  
defeated, Newsweek Senior Editor Jonathan Alter wished in the August 19  
issue. He gave pro-abortion Republicans his recipe for political  
success. In a piece titled "The Passion Gap," he wrote: "Pro-choice  
Republicans insist it's their party, too. But the high-minded moderates  
are too polite to take on the hard-charging right. Until they do, the  
GOP may never truly win over the country."
<DD>The crux of his wisdom? Attack your loyal supporters:  
"This is now the fifth nominating convention in which the GOP has  
applied an anti-abortion litmus test. Ronald Reagan signed an  
abortion-rights law as Governor of California, then changed his position  
in time for his presidential campaigns. George Bush was such a supporter  
of family planning as a congressman that he was called `Rubbers,' but by  
the 1980s had flip-flopped. Bob Dole is pro-life but has gone back and  
forth so many times on platform language and planks that he has raised  
basic questions about his leadership. If he can't stand up to a Phyllis  
Schlafly, how would he handle a Saddam Hussein?"
<DD>Alter closed by holding up the Democratic Party, the same party that  
shut Governor Bob Casey out of its 1992 convention for his pro-life  
views, as an example of the big-tent the GOP should emulate: "The only  
real way to change the Republican Party is for...a pro-choice candidate  
to run for President in 2000....Sometime soon a compelling moderate  
Republican will take a leaf from the successes of centrist Democrats and  
enter a few primaries. Then we'll find out if the Republicans can  
finally pitch that big tent they like to talk about."
<P>
<H4>Republicans Scare Women.</H4>
<P>
 <DD>Supposed GOP intolerance and how Republican policies scare women  
dominated morning show interviews during the Republican gathering in San  
Diego. Talking to Susan Molinari, Christine Todd Whitman, and Kay Bailey  
Hutchison on August 13, Good Morning America's Charlie Gibson laid out  
why women are turned off by Republicans: "It was the Republican Party  
that did take the lead on ending federal welfare payments as they have  
been traditionally paid over the last 50 to 60 years and the prime  
beneficiaries of that are women. It is the Republican Party that took  
the lead on reducing the rate of growth in Medicare and Medicaid. It is  
the Republican Party now that is trying to make an issue of denying  
education and benefits to the children of illegal immigrants. It is the  
Republican Party that has rejected in the last week or so, tolerance  
language on abortion in the platform."
<DD>He also asked: "There was an attempt by some in the platform hearings to  
get language included in the platform that simply asked for toleration  
of dissenting views particularly on abortion. It was language that Bob  
Dole wanted in the platform. The party rejected him, it rejected your  
views, all three of you in this, is this a tolerant party, do you feel  
comfortable in it with its position on tolerance?"
<DD>Quizzing Colin Powell on Today, Katie Couric queried: "Does the party  
platform trouble you? Does the fact that some of these governors opted  
not to speak because they were told they could not discuss their views  
on abortion, do all those things make you basically doubt that this is a  
big tent here?"
<P>
<H4>Buchanan "Destroyed" Bush.</H4>
<P>
<DD>Four years later the media still promote the idea that Pat Buchanan's  
1992 speech, not reneging on his "no new taxes" pledge, led to George  
Bush's defeat. Andrea Mitchell stated on MSNBC August 12 after Colin  
Powell spoke: "There's a real interesting contrast here because Pat  
Buchanan set the tone for the Houston convention four years ago with the  
same prime time starring role on the first night of the convention and  
that of course was the speech that many people feel destroyed George  
Bush's chance of winning re-election because it set a very narrow,  
exclusive and mean-spirited tone and tonight we had the contrast of  
Colin Powell." 
<DD>Earlier in the day on ABC's Good Morning America, co-host Charles Gibson  
couldn't let the issue die: "It is this convention that is going to be  
harmonious. The Republicans are determined that there will be no repeat  
of Houston 1992, which many saw as a harsh and divisive convention."  
While never mentioning that raising taxes could have cost Bush the  
election, ABC's John Cochran opined on World News Tonight: "The one  
thing that Bush did not have to tell Dole is that at all cost Dole  
should try to prevent a re-run of that bitter divisive convention four  
years ago in Houston, that so badly damaged Bush's chances for  
re-election. Dole knows that only too well."
<P>
<H4>Delegates Out of Touch.</H4>
<P>
<DD>Early in the first day of PBS/NBC coverage, millionaire Tom Brokaw  
asked: "The big question, of course, what is the Republican Party these  
days?...Well on the floor of this convention hall, they are  
overwhelmingly white and male, male by a factor of about two to  
one...The largest single income group, more than 38 percent of the  
people here earn more than $100,000 a year." On the CBS Evening News  
that night Ed Bradley asserted: "For the most part they are white, male,  
and they are older than the average American. They are also more  
conservative than the average American. They are also wealthier - about  
a third of the delegates earn more than $100,000 a year." 
<DD>Millionaire anchor Dan Rather announced in prime time: "Delegates in  
this convention have been selected, inspected, detected, categorized by  
the press, the pols, the pros, and the pollsters. We know they're mostly  
male, overwhelmingly white, mostly well to the right politically, and  
almost one in five of these delegates is a millionaire."
<DD>CNN's Judy Woodruff raised the media-created issue with keynote speaker  
Susan Molinari: "We look at the statistics of how many women delegates.  
What? 43 percent in 1992. Only 36 percent of the delegates are women  
this year. What sort of signal does that send to the country, you  
think?"
<DD>Woodruff also complained: "We talked to Jack Kemp a little while ago and  
asked him about, among other things, the fact that not only not just the  
language in the platform - only three percent of these delegates are  
African American. Only 36 percent of these delegates are women. This is  
not a convention that is necessarily representative even of the broader  
Republican Party, the people who vote Republican, much less the  
electorate overall."
<DD>A Washington Post survey of delegates determined that while 56 percent  
of Republicans reported an income of over $75,000, so did 46 percent of  
Democrats.

<h2>Reaganomics, the Scary Sequel?</h2>
<P>
<H4>Skepticism Showered on Dole Tax Cut Absent for Clinton's 1993 Proposals</H4>
<P>
<DD>Bob Dole's surprising advocacy of an across-the-board tax cut drew quick 
criticism from reporters as the unwelcome return of deficit-ballooning 
Reaganomics.
<P>
<DD>Hours after Dole's tax cut announcement on August 5, NBC Nightly News 
reporter David Bloom declared: "Most economists say the  Reagan tax cuts 
did worsen the budget deficit and many are skeptical of Dole's plan." 
NBC's Mike Jensen agreed about "most economists" minutes later: "They 
say these tax cuts could cause huge budget deficits as they did during 
the Reagan years."
<P>
<DD>CBS Evening News reporter Linda Douglass warned  Dole weeks before on 
July 23: "Each of the proposals he's considering would cost hundreds of 
billions of dollars. Dole will have to convince voters that won't drive 
up the deficit."
<P>
<DD>Newsweek's Joe Klein pronounced: "The Dole tax cut stands, to all but 
hard-core taxophobes, as a transparent and rather pathetic bit of 
politics. He wants to cut $548 billion over six years? And balance the 
budget? Does anyone actually believe this?"
<P>
<DD>The August 12 Investor's Business Daily noted the real Reagan record: 
that Clinton's own Economic Report of the President showed "receipts 
from individual income taxes rose to $446 billion in fiscal `89, 
Reagan's last budget, from $286 billion in fiscal `81, the year Reagan 
began to slash personal rates. That's a 56 percent gain...Spending rose 
to $1.143 trillion in `89 from $678 billion in `81. That's a 69 percent 
gain."
<P>
<DD>Skepticism of Reaganomics stood in stark contrast to the media's 
salesmanlike reaction to Clinton economic proposals in 1992 and 1993. On 
the September 15, 1993 Sunday Morning, CBS's Douglass simply passed on 
the notion that Clinton could insure 37 million uninsured Americans with 
a cigarette tax: "They have a very elaborate plan to pay for this 
revolution in health care. It doesn't provide much in the way of taxes, 
just a sin tax, cigarette tax. They claim the money's going to come from 
savings in spending."
<P>
<DD>After years of stopping deficit-busting stimulus packages and 
nationalized health plans, Newsweek's Howard Fineman awarded the credit 
for the deficit not to Dole, but to his rival: "Clinton, meanwhile, can 
brag that the annual deficit has been cut in half on his watch -- and 
that he's a champion of fiscal responsibility. In other words, he can be 
Bob Dole."
<P>
<DD>The next week, Time contributor George J. Church echoed Fineman: "A case 
could be made that the candidate who best represents the fiscally 
conservative, moderate Republican tradition is, believe it or not, Bill 
Clinton."

in the system and for taxpayers tired of paying for lifetime recipients. 
But after President Clinton agreed to sign the bill, the networks came 
at it from the left, focusing on those who supposedly would be hurt, 
thus helping Clinton put himself in the middle of the political 
spectrum.
<P>
<DD>NBC's Lisa Myers began a July 31 Nightly News segment: "For six years 
now Cindy McDonald and her three children have struggled to make their 
$400 welfare check and $300 in food stamps last until the end of the 
month. She says she can never treat her kids to candy or soda, they're 
expensive luxuries and has no car to take them anywhere. The phrase 
`welfare reform' infuriates her." She whined: "If they strip me from 
what little I have right now, then I don't know how my kids are going to 
eat." Myers did point out that McDonald actually has two years to find a 
job, but concluded: "Exactly how McDonald and others will cope with the 
change is uncertain. Even supporters of the bill privately admit that 
this is a gamble, that some will lose.''
<P>
<DD>On the CBS Evening News, substitute anchor Paula Zahn announced: "Once 
the welfare bill becomes law, millions of Americans will find their 
lives starting to change in startling and unwelcome ways." Reporter  
John Blackstone looked at three recipients. First up, a woman who just 
had a baby: "[Martina] Gillis, a single mother of two, has been on 
welfare for three years. The new welfare reforms would force her to get 
a job, any job, but that would mean giving up, or at least postponing 
her dream, of graduating from college." Blackstone did ask her if it's 
the taxpayers' responsibility to pay for her mistake and then moved to a 
Mexican immigrant who cried about being cut off.
<P>
<DD>Third, leading into his conclusion, he put on a woman who "says she 
applied for welfare today so she can take care of her two daughters. 
Welfare reform may be aimed at the mothers. But the effects of this 
experiment, good or bad, will be felt equally by the children."
<P>
<DD>On the next day's CBS Evening News, Zahn warned: "The new, landmark 
welfare overhaul President Clinton promised to sign won't be law for a 
while yet, but there is already is a great deal of fear and anxiety all 
over the country over the impact it will have."

<H2>Backhanded Bias</H2>
<H3>Kemp Choice Spurs Talk of "Haters"  </H3>

<DD>Bob Dole's choice of Jack Kemp as a running mate drew praise from a  
number of reporters and analysts, but sometimes that praise accompanied  
backhanded insults about the "haters" that comprise the rest of the  
Republican Party.

<DD>CNN polling analyst Bill Schneider touted the choice on the August 9  
Inside Politics, praising Kemp as he impugned other conservatives: "He  
is a rare combination -- a nice conservative. These days conservatives  
are supposed to be mean. They're supposed to be haters. Bob Novak talked  
a minute ago about the frowning face of the Republican Party. Jack Kemp  
is buoyant, he's effusive, he's inclusive of everybody in the country,  
not just in the Republican Party. He puts a different face on that  
ticket."

<DD>On the August 9 World News Tonight, ABC's Cokie Roberts also played  
backhand with Kemp: "He's very optimistic, but he's also very inclusive,  
reaching out to minorities, to women, being for immigration, for  
affirmative action. And I think that's very important for this  
particular convention, Peter, and this party, which is seen somewhat  
dour, and somewhat mean in its ways to have someone with a big smile on  
his face saying `you all come,' and `I'm going to cut your taxes' while  
you're at it, is not a bad thing for the Republicans."

<DD>During live coverage August 10 of Kemp's vice presidential announcement  
in Russell, Kansas, CNN anchor A0Judy Woodruff declared: "On welfare, up  
through the last few years, he's advocated more moderate policies than  
those that were passed this month by the Republican-controlled Congress.  
Jack Kemp does not like the idea of taking money -- yanking money away  
from welfare mothers with small children."

<DD>Hours later on CNN's Capital Gang, Woodruff's husband, Al Hunt,  
Executive Washington Editor of The Wall Street Journal, disparaged the  
platform while praising the Kemp pick: "Jack Kemp is gonna not only  
excite this convention, but he cuts across regional, racial and  
generational lines, across all of America, and I think that he and his  
incredibly attractive family are going to add lustre and intellectual  
firepower. Now there are some risks. He has a few flaky views, the gold  
standard for one, and more important, Jack Kemp is a can-do optimist who  
cares about all people and that s going to put him at odds with a  
platform that is protectionist, mean-spirited, anti-immigration,  
insensitive to racial minorities."   

<DD>On that day's Inside Politics, Bill Schneider proceeded to repeat the  
previous day's slur: "Kemp also has a rare combination of qualities. He  
s a nice conservative. There haven't been too many of those since Ronald  
Reagan. Most conservatives these days come across as mean [video of Newt  
Gingrich] or intolerant [video of Pat Buchanan] or grouchy [video of Bob  
Dole]. Kemp is tolerant and inclusive. He has an excellent relationship  
with minorities. He showed real courage two years ago when he came out  
against Proposition 187, the punitive anti-illegal immigration measure  
in California. Kemp is not a hater."

<h2>News Bites</h2>
<CENTER><h3>From the September 1996 Media Watch</h3></CENTER>
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<H4>Poll: Most Say Media Favor Clinton.  </H4>
A September survey for the Pew Research Center for the People and the  
Press found that while most of the public thinks coverage of Clinton and  
Dole has been fair, when asked "Who do you think most newspaper  
reporters and TV journalists want to see win the presidential election,"  
59 percent said Clinton, 17 percent Dole and just one percent Perot.
<p>
As to how much influence news organizations have on which candidate  
becomes President, 64 percent thought "too much," 30 percent said "about  
right" and a mere four percent believed "too little."
<p>
<H4>
Nasty Bob, Pure Bill </H4>  

On September 12, Bob Dole demanded that Bill Clinton release his medical  
records and complained that Clinton's ads were overwhelmingly negative.  
Instead of examining the tone of Clinton ads, ABC and CBS portrayed Dole  
as the villain.  
<p>
On ABC's World News Tonight, Peter Jennings said: "The campaign for  
President took a nasty turn today. First, Bob Dole departed from his  
standard stump speech in Kentucky, lashing out at the Democrats for what  
he says they are saying about him, and negative advertising was the  
kindest thing Mr. Dole had to say." After a piece on Dole, Jennings  
introduced the next story: "The President is going to come under further  
Republican attack with the release next week of the House Committee on  
Government Operations and Oversight's report on the firings at the White  
House travel office."
<p>
On the CBS Evening News Dan Rather followed the same Clinton-as-victim  
theme: "Now for his part, Bob Dole reopened one of his favorite lines of  
attack today about President Clinton's health records." Reporter Phil  
Jones provided a very short piece just on the medical records,  
concluding: "Dan, this campaign is headed exactly where everybody  
expected it to go: personal."
<p>

<H4>Bloom and Doom  </H4>

Only NBC Nightly News bothered to show viewers that night what upset  
Dole. Tom Brokaw declared: "Bob Dole on the ropes and looking for a way  
to boost his sagging campaign made it clear today he is taking off the  
gloves in the war of the political airwaves."
<p>
Reporter David Bloom began: "Stung by a barrage of negative television  
advertising, Bob Dole today accused Bill Clinton of running a campaign  
of fear, of engaging in character assassination." Bloom aired Clinton  
declaring "This must be a campaign of ideas, not a campaign of insults,"  
and then added: "But since then, the Dole camp claims the Democrats have  
run only 42 positive ads with 4, 0 negative ads running across the  
country."  
<p>
Bloom explained: "Dole aides say the campaign will double its ad budget  
next week, unveiling new attack ads blaming Clinton for rising teen drug  
use, ads even tougher than this one." After an ad clip, Bloom ended: "At  
a Dole rally today the music blared `get ready.' Get ready, that is, for  
a very nasty campaign."    
<p>

<H4>What "Moderate" Democrats?</H4>

 "Return to Chicago: This Time, the Democrats Embrace Moderation,"  
declared the headline on the front of the Washington Post's August 25  
convention section. Four pages later, the Post headline over a story on  
a survey of delegates read: "Delegates Leaning More Liberal Than Their  
Leader or the Rank and File." Indeed, 82 percent favored affirmative  
action, 65 percent were against a balanced budget amendment, 72 percent  
opposed "reducing spending on social programs," but 65 percent wanted  
less defense spending.
<P>
Three days later, New York Times reporter David Rosebaum insisted the  
Democratic platform "takes a middle ground between the unfettered  
capitalism and government-enforced morality espoused by Republicans and  
the welfare-state economics and Aquarian values that once formed  
Democrats' image." Four paragraphs later, Rosenbaum summarized the  
"middle ground" policies: "The Democrats call for government-paid  
abortions for poor women, full civil rights for homosexuals, a strong  
commitment to public schools, gun control, tobacco regulations, a  
continuation of affirmative action programs and a greater emphasis on  
environmental protection than on the development of resources."
<P>

<H4>"Most Economists" Split.</H4>

An August survey of 700 economists found that "52 percent blame the  
growth of the federal deficit in the 1980s on increased government  
spending more than on the Reagan tax cut," which was blamed by 48  
percent. The fact that economists are about evenly split contradicts  
many recent media reports.
<p>
"Most economists say the Reagan tax cuts did worsen the budget deficit  
and many are skeptical of Dole's plan," announced reporter David Bloom  
on the August 5 NBC Nightly News. Colleague Mike Jensen insisted a few  
minutes later that "most analysts say it's not good economics." The next  
morning a headline over a Washington Post news story declared:  
"Economists Question Dole's Plan." The headline over a Boston Globe news  
story asserted: "Economists Cool to Dole's Tax-Cut Plan: Candidate  
Speaks of Growth, but Analysts See No Big Payoff."   
<p>
The poll of 700 members of the American Economics Association discovered  
that 81 percent agreed that the Reagan tax cuts increased economic  
growth. A plurality of 42 percent "want to see the next Congress put a  
high priority on both restraining government spending and cutting  
taxes," matching the Dole-Kemp promise. William Adams, a professor at  
George Washington University, directed the poll conducted August 19-21.  
<p>
Though reported in The Weekly Standard and The Washington Times, none of  
the previously noted outlets revised their claims. In fact, in the  
September 9 Post, reporter Clay Chandler focused only on the answer  
which put Dole in the minority: "A majority expressed doubt about the  
notion that 30 percent of the revenue lost from a 15 percent cut in  
marginal income tax rates would" be recaptured.
<p>

<H4>Another Gore Gaffe That Wasn't.</H4>

After Al Gore's emotional August 28 speech recalled the 1984 death of  
his sister Nancy and how it motivated him to fight the tobacco industry,  
ABC, NBC, and CNN did suggest hypocrisy. Jennings noted that "tobacco  
companies are here in Chicago wining and dining the hierarchy of the  
Democratic Party." NBC's Tom Brokaw recalled that "the Gore family were  
tobacco farmers." On CNN, Judy Woodruff suggested that Gore "was  
responding to what was said in San Diego," where his tobacco roots were  
highlighted.
<p>
But all the networks ignored the July 3 New York Times report that in  
1988, Al Gore told an audience of tobacco farmers during his  
presidential campaign: "Throughout most of my life, I raised tobacco. I  
want you to know that with my own hands, all of my life, I put it in the  
plant beds and transferred it. I've hoed it. I've dug in it. I've  
sprayed it, I've chopped it, I've shredded it, spiked it, put it in the  
barn and stripped it and A0sold it." Dan Quayle can only dream of  
getting away with something like that. 
<P>

<H4>Base Bias.</H4>

CBS Evening News took two different approaches to the passionate poles  
that create each party's base. The day before the Republican convention,  
CBS reporter John Roberts suggested "hard-line anti-abortionists"  
controlled the Republican Party: "Delegates are pursuing their own  
agendas and forcing party leaders, including Dole, to fall into line  
behind them...so far the rogue elephants seem to be calling the shots."  
<p>
But on August 28, reporter Harry Smith's piece on unions didn't talk  
about ideologically extreme unions pushing around the party, but how  
Bill Clinton failed to be liberal enough for them: "It still takes steel  
to make America's cars. It still takes labor to get a Democrat elected  
President. But talk to the union rank and file, and you'll find that  
their enthusiasm is less than red hot.... We talked with United Auto  
Workers in Dearborn, Michigan this week. Their biggest gripe: Bill  
Clinton's support of the North American Free Trade Agreement...Organized  
labor will invest millions of dollars to get Bill Clinton elected this  
fall. These dues-paying members wonder if they are still getting their  
money's worth."  
<P>

<H4>Sunday Lefties.  </H4>

The networks came at Republicans from the left on abortion in San Diego,  
and on the Sunday before the Democrats convened, they also came at  
Democrats from the left. By concentrating on liberal complaints about  
welfare reform, reporters helped Bill Clinton's effort to portray  
himself as a centrist. On the August  
<P>
CBS Evening News, Dan Rather demanded of DNC General Chairman Chris  
Dodd: "You said this morning that the party's message will focus on the  
needs and cares of the people. Now, how do you reconcile that with a  
President who has just signed a quote `welfare reform bill' which by  
general agreement is going to put a lot of poor children on the street?"  
Earlier, on Face the Nation, CBS reporter Rita Braver asked Chicago  
Mayor Richard Daley: "Aren't you scared about what is going to happen?  
Aren't you afraid you are going to have a lot of hungry children?"  
<P>
That same day NBC Meet the Press moderator Tim Russert demanded of Dodd:  
"It's an issue of morality to many people, and how can you defend a  
President who basically said to the congressional Democrats: Listen,  
that's your view, but I'm doing this, because -- was it politically  
expedient?" Russert tried the same line with strategist James Carville:  
"But the Democratic Party for sixty years, James Carville, fought for a  
minimum guarantee payment to poor children and Bill Clinton undid that.  
Don't you have to draw the line someplace and say `I'm a Democrat and  
this is what I stand for'?"

<P>
<H4>Welfare-State Television</H4>

All three networks featured stories August 27 critical of the new  
welfare reform law. On NBC Nightly News, Tom Brokaw presented his view:  
"There are serious questions about what happens to these people after  
they're taken off the welfare rolls. Andrea Mitchell went to Indiana to  
look at the conflict between fixing the system and doing the right thing  
by people." Mitchell featured no welfare reform proponents, just social  
workers, Jesse Jackson, and impending victims: "Kimberly Gilbert will  
get benefits for two years. After that, she's cut off, whether or not  
she finds a job. That deadline is near for Charla Milton. Unable to find  
work, she is terrified."
<P>
On ABC's World News Tonight, Peter Jennings suggested: "Maybe if he is  
reelected, Mr. Clinton will do something to reverse himself on welfare  
reform. Many of these delegates hope so." ABC reporter Erin Hayes asked  
where the jobs would come from to support welfare recipients: "An Urban  
League study found in Chicago there are six times as many people who  
need work as there are entry-level jobs available." Hayes aired no  
voices favoring welfare reform, and concluded: "There is another concern  
as well: the young children. When their mothers are made to go to work,  
who will take care of them? Right now, no one really has an answer. With  
so much still uncertain about welfare reform, it is no wonder there is  
fear out there."
<P>
CBS reporter Harry Smith also ignored taxpayers and focused on victims  
on the CBS Evening News: "We talked to four welfare moms from across  
Chicago. They feel like they are this year's political  
target...President Clinton seemed deaf to protests last week when he  
signed the new welfare cuts into law. Cuts many Americans support, but  
cuts these women think go too far." Smith concluded: "Neighborhoods like  
Cabrini-Green have more than their share of misery. Folks around here  
think misery is only going to grow. Their long faith in the Democratic  
Party has been shaken, and the actions of President Clinton confirm  
their fear that the poor just do not count."

<H4>Democratic Harshness</H4>
<DD>Democrats blame the GOP for harsh personal attacks, but on the August 26  
Good Morning America co-host Charlie Gibson asked Senator Christopher  
Dodd: "You said the other day that `I got the word out,' that I don't  
want to hear personal attacks against the Republicans at this  
convention. Yesterday on his train trip the President accused  
Republicans of blackmail to get their budget. Al Gore, yesterday,  
accused the Republicans of ignorance and audacity, talked about the  
two-headed monster of Dole and Gingrich. Dick Gephardt, the leader of  
the House, of the Democrats, talked about Republican extremism, said  
they're radicals. Talk about getting the word out?"
<P>
<H4>Labor's Power Ties</H4>

<DD>The labor unions didn't get the Darth Vader treatment reserved in San  
Diego for the Christian Coalition, but in Chicago there were a few  
critical looks at union power.

<DD>CNN campaign finance reporter Brooks Jackson delivered a story on the  
unions' political campaign in which he observed: "So Bill Clinton says  
the era of big government is over? Not at the Democratic convention,  
where unionized government workers are suiting up for battle against  
Republicans."
<DD>On World News Tonight August 27, ABC's Brian Ross reported: "In the  
world of big money and Democratic politics on public display this week  
in Chicago, this man holds a special place. His name is Arthur Coia, who  
despite being president of a labor union the FBI says has long been  
controlled by the Mafia, the Laborers International has become one of  
the Democrats' top money people, raising millions and gaining him  
special access to the Clinton White House....In the last two years, the  
Clinton administration has gone all-out to court Coia and his union  
money with invitations to the White House and an appearance by the First  
Lady at a big union conference."
<DD>Ross added detail: "In an abrupt change of plans that raised questions  
about whether the union's money to the Democrats had bought it some kind  
of sweetheart deal, prosecutors dropped the allegations and instead  
quietly negotiated a deal with Coia that let him keep his job and put  
him in charge of cleaning up the union."

<h2>The Spin: Both Parties Too Conservative</h2>
<P>
<H4>TV Analysts Label Democrats Twice As Often, But Fire Mostly Liberal Questions in Chicago</H4>
<P>
<DD>The networks had big news from the Democratic convention in Chicago: 
liberals exist in the Democratic Party, and they didn't like President 
Clinton's decision to sign a welfare reform bill. From both the 
Republican and Democratic conventions, the networks relayed the same 
message: the parties had become too conservative.
<P>
<DD>During the Chicago convention:
<UL>
<LI><a href="#label">(1)</a> Democratic delegates, speakers, and candidates were labeled twice as often as the Republicans were in San Diego, although they were labeled as extreme only one-fourth as often; 
<LI><a href="#questions">(2)</a> Reporters and anchors posed almost five times as many questions from the left as from the right, a much more liberal questioning agenda than the Democratic convention four years ago; and 
<LI><a href="#welfare">(3)</a> the controversy over welfare reform dominated the convention story line, while the Democrats' abortion-on-demand stance and exclusion of some pro-life speakers garnered no network mentions in prime time.
</UL>
<DD>As during the Republican convention, MediaWatch analysts watched live 
prime-time coverage of the Democratic convention for a special daily 
Media Reality Check '96 newsletter. Analysts watched all ABC, CBS, and 
NBC prime time coverage, as well as the combined PBS/NBC broadcast and 
CNN starting at 8 pm Eastern time.
<P>
<a name="label">
<B>Labeling</B>
<P>
<DD>Previous convention studies in 1984, 1988, and 1992 found the 
Republicans were tagged as conservative or very conservative far more 
often than the Democrats were called liberal or very liberal, with 
reporters instead playing up the moderate nature of Democratic 
candidates and delegates. In 1992, Republicans drew 131 labels, 118 (90 
percent) of them conservative; the Democrats had 89 labels, 51 (57 
percent) of them moderate or conservative.
<P>
<DD>In 1996, the Republicans were labeled only 59 times, 46 of them (78 
percent) conservative; while the Democrats were labeled twice as often, 
on 119 occasions, and 75 of those tags (63 percent) were liberal, to 
only 44 moderate or conservative labels. The Republicans were still four 
times as likely to be described as extreme as the Democrats -- 16 to 4 
-- but the Democrats were never described as extremely liberal in 1992.
<P>
<DD>ABC (with three moderate/conservative labels and 15 liberal tags) was 
the network most willing to underline the liberal nature of the party 
gathered in Chicago, while CBS (8 moderate/conservative, 10 liberal) CNN 
(13-20), NBC-PBS (15-24), and NBC (5-6) held to a more traditional 
percentage of moderate labeling. Labeling decreased nightly -- from 40 
on Monday, to 35 on Tuesday, to 13 on Wednesday -- and then jumped back 
up to 31 on Thursday, when the departure of Dick Morris spurred 
speculation about Clinton's post-Morris ideological positioning.
<P>
<DD>In 1992, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and the Democratic platform were never 
described as liberal. In 1996, Clinton was described as moderate on 28 
occasions and liberal on 16 occasions, but almost always as a tactical 
function of "moving to the left" or "moving to the right." In San Diego, 
the Republican platform was described as conservative on six occasions; 
in Chicago, the platform was described as moderate on six occasions. 
<P>
<I>Some examples of labeling:</I>
<P>
<DD>As the Republican convention began on August 12, PBS anchor Charlayne 
Hunter-Gault told former Sen. Howard Baker: "Pat Buchanan said most of 
his views, most of Senator Dole's views, were consistent with his own, 
and he cited specifically, affirmative action, and the platform position 
of illegal immigration. And as you know, Pat Buchanan is on the farthest 
extreme of the right wing of the party."
<P>
<DD>CNN reporter Gene Randall declared on August 13: "With me is Phyllis 
Schlafly, an ardent anti-abortion rights advocate...Do you think the 
speakers do not reflect the conservatism of the platform?"
<P>
<DD>CNN's Bob Franken explained the next night: "It's interesting they just 
had a minute ago a very brief tribute to the Republican freshmen in the 
House of Representatives. Why brief? Because they are highly, highly 
controversial. It's the freshmen in the House of Representatives that 
really gave Bill Clinton the extremist issue, fairly or unfairly."
<P>
<DD>In Chicago on August 26, ABC's Sam Donaldson explained the Democrats 
"want to accomplish the same thing the Republicans accomplished -- 
showing a unified party, even though we know from our survey that these 
delegates are far to the left of the mainstream just as the Republican 
delegates were to the right of the mainstream."
<P>
<DD>That night on CBS, Dan Rather asked Jesse Jackson: "Bill Clinton's been 
running pretty hard to the right, so far that some Democrats now call 
him a `Republicrat.' Do you go that far?"
<P>
<DD>Tom Brokaw put Clinton and Gore in Newt Gingrich territory: "Since 1994 
they have slid across the political spectrum to really right of center. 
And they've got a guy by the name of Dick Morris who's advising them on 
a daily basis how to be more pragmatic."
<P>
<DD>Three nights later, Brokaw exemplified post-Morris speculation in asking 
James Carville: "He was the man who moved him to the right. I know that 
you had some philosophical differences with Dick Morris. Does this mean 
that the door has been opened again for those of you who believe that 
the President probably ought to move a little more left of center?"
<P>
<a name="questions">
<B>Agenda Questions</B>
<P>
<DD>The bottom dropped out on agenda questions from the right in 1996. In 
1992, Republicans were asked 130 questions from the left, while 
Democrats were asked only 38 from the right. Actually, Democrats were 
asked more questions from the left (45) than the right (38).
<P>
<DD>In 1996, network reporters asked Republicans 51 questions from the left, 
and only six from the right. Thanks to welfare reform, the pattern in 
Chicago was almost exactly the same: 47 questions from the left, 11 from 
the right.
<P>
<DD>In Chicago, ABC asked only two liberal questions and one conservative 
question, followed by NBC with just three liberal questions and one 
conservative.
<P>
<DD>CBS (12 liberal, zero conservative), CNN (13-2), and NBC-PBS (17-7) 
clearly preferred a menu of questions from the left. Combine both 
conventions, and the questioning numbers are more stark: ABC (five 
liberal, one conservative), CBS (20-3), CNN (23-3), NBC-PBS (37-8), and 
NBC (13-2). Some examples of agenda questions: 
<UL>
<LI><I>From the right to Republicans:</I> CNN's Gene Randall asked New York Gov. George Pataki on August 13: "The focus tonight of course is on the keynote speech and that is by Representative [Susan] Molinari, who it's well known favors abortion rights. Do you sense a dissatisfaction on this floor that she will be giving this address?"
<LI><I>From the left to Republicans:</I> CNN's Judy Woodruff inquired of Rep. Susan Molinari on August 12: "Leading up to the convention, Bob Dole was running well behind President Clinton with women voters. We look at the statistics of how many women delegates. What, 43 percent in 1992. Only 36 percent of delegates are women this year. What sort of signal does that send the country, you think?"
<LI><I>From the right to Democrats:</I> NBC's David Bloom asked James Carville after Hillary Clinton's speech August 27: "I was struck by the fact that she talked about health care and the need for more health care insurance for the unemployed. That's a topic that got her and Bill Clinton into a lot of trouble two years ago. Why would she revisit that tonight?"
<LI><I>From the left to Democrats:</I> ABC's Michel McQueen asked former DNC official Lynn Cutler on August 26: "She is comparing her candidate not to perfection, but to Bob Dole. Isn't that right, Lynn -- do the liberals in the party, as you unashamedly describe yourself, feel abandoned by the President this year?"
</UL>
<a name="welfare">
<B>Controversy: Welfare</B>
<P>
<DD>The controversy over welfare reform surfaced in prime time on 44 
occasions (questions plus comments by reporters), forming the most 
common basis for liberal analysis. As in agenda questions, ABC (4) and 
NBC (2) did not dwell very much on the welfare controversy, and NBC-PBS 
raised it 10 times in a longer time frame. CNN (16) and CBS (9) were 
most interested in the story.
<P>
<DD>Tom Brokaw provided the only example found of coming at the issue from 
the right, even if it sounded like he wished some lesser welfare reform 
had passed before the GOP takeover of Congress. He asked HHS Secretary 
Donna Shalala: "I guess the question a lot of us have is why didn't you 
come up with something of your own two years ago when you had power in 
the Congress, before Newt Gingrich and the Republicans took over, when 
you knew that Repub -- welfare reform was a high-priority issue for this 
country and the President was talking about it when he was running in 
1992?"
<P>
<DD>Brokaw also asked a more typical network question: "If you were a poor 
single mother in a poor rural state in America, without many resources, 
and you wanted to go to work, you want to do the right things, but there 
aren't too many jobs for people who have real skills. Wouldn't you be 
slightly terrified looking into the next two years?"
<P>
<DD>CBS reporter Ed Bradley questioned far-left Rep. Ron Dellums on August 
29: "Congressman Dellums was unhappy when the President signed the 
welfare bill. I know you saw it not as welfare reform but more as a 
budget cut. What does he have to do to fix it?" Bradley followed up: 
"When the President is expected to say tonight that he's going to 
propose a $3.5 billion jobs program for welfare recipients, is that 
enough?"
<P>
<DD>Judy Woodruff pleaded with Hillary Clinton to intervene with her husband 
in six questions of an August 27 interview: "We were just reminded in 
that moving film that we saw here of your lifelong work as an advocate 
for children's causes. And yet, late last week, your husband signed a 
welfare reform bill that as you know, Senator Patrick Moynihan and other 
welfare experts are saying is going to throw a million children into 
poverty. Does that legislation undo so much of what you've worked for 
over the years?"

<h2>60 Minutes Does a 180 on Dole</h2>
<P>
<H4>Rather Asks Clinton If GOP's Extreme, Stahl Raps Dole for Criticizing Hillary</H4>
<P>
<DD>Labor Day weekend marks the start of the campaign season, and this year 
the 60 Minutes interviews with the two presidential candidates 
demonstrated how it also corresponds with another season of tilted 
coverage. 
<P>
<DD>In his August 18 interview with Bill Clinton, Dan Rather wasn't as 
interested in posing questions as setting up speeches: "Some of your 
staff members, not by name, have been saying, `Yes, the President thinks 
Bob Dole is a nice person and has been a pretty good leader in some 
ways,' but, say they, `he's been captured by the extremists in the 
Republican Party, the radical part of the Republican Party, including 
Newt Gingrich.' Is that what you think?"
<P>
<DD>Rather then led Clinton through a set of GOP convention speeches. He 
showed Dole charging Clinton led "a core of elites who never grew up, 
did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered, and never learned." 
He played video of Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison mentioning the FBI files, 
and George Bush on the White House being "diminished" since his wife 
left.
<P>
<DD>When Clinton's response wasn't strong enough, Rather added: "I don't 
know of anyone in the convention who didn't take that as a difference of 
the present First Lady and the former First Lady." Rather insisted: 
"Don't you get mad, Mr. President, when this sort of thing happens?"
<P>
<DD>Two weeks later Lesley Stahl interviewed Bob Dole. But in her September 
1 talk she gave Dole less time to react to attacks. Stahl didn't suggest 
Clinton is too far to the left and when Dole complained about unfair 
attacks, she made him defend his criticisms. Rather never argued with 
Clinton, but Stahl debated the advisability of Dole's tax cut plan.
<P>
<DD>Stahl began by underlining the Democrats' decency: "At the Democratic 
convention, a lot of Democrats were saying that Bob Dole is a good and 
decent man, and even Bill Clinton made a point of saying Bob Dole loves 
his country. I'm wondering what you think of Bill Clinton. What kind of 
a man do you think he is?"
<P>
<DD>When Dole complained about Democratic attacks, Stahl aired a convention 
clip of Al Gore saying Dole voted against creating Medicare and 
Medicaid, Peace Corps and Head Start. She assumed such votes would have 
been wrong: "Did you really vote against all these things?" Then she 
turned on Dole, asking: "They say that you were unfair in what you said 
about Hillary....Do you think you were unfair in what you said to her?"
<P>
<DD>Stahl made Dole respond to 11 inquiries doubting the tax cut. She 
demanded he explain how he's going to pay for it, contending that in 
the '80s he was correct to oppose Reaganomics: "You were right, it did 
explode the deficit."

<h2>Poor Hillary, Is It Worth It?</h2>
<P>
<H4>Media Disdain GOP's "Bitter Attacks"</H4>
<P>
<DD>During the week of the Democratic convention the three networks got a 
chance to interview First Lady Hillary Clinton, but their favorite topic 
was the First Lady's role as the beleaguered martyr of unfortunate 
Republican attacks.
<P>
<DD>On Monday, CNN's Judy Woodruff went first: "Let me take you back to San 
Diego. Bob Dole said it doesn't take a village, a collective, the state, 
which he said has made mistakes in raising children, it takes a family. 
Is this something that is going to become a major issue in this fall 
campaign?"
<P>
<DD>Woodruff inquired: "Also in San Diego, former President George Bush told 
the delegates he `worked hard,' I'm quoting here, `to uphold the dignity 
and the honor of the presidency, to treat it with respect. And then he 
added, quote, `it breaks his heart, when the White House is demeaned, 
the presidency diminished.' Does that hurt coming from your immediate 
predecessor?"
<P>
<DD>Woodruff kept going: "He then went on, Mrs. Clinton, he made a point of 
saying that his wife, Mrs. Bush, quote, `unquestionably upheld the honor 
of the White House.' Is that an insult to you?" When Mrs. Clinton failed 
to answer sharply enough, Woodruff insisted: "But he was clearly drawing 
a contrast there...you're not hurt?"
<P>
<DD>Stories of Mrs. Clinton's rough-house approach to politics, such as her 
reported role in firing and lodging criminal accusations against seven 
workers of the White House Travel Office, did not prevent CBS This 
Morning co-host Jose Diaz-Balart from asking on August 26: "In the San 
Diego Republican convention, you were the subject of much conversation, 
and I think the target, I think many would say, of some very serious 
attacks....Do you ever, seriously, in the White House, when all the 
doors are closed, do you ever say `Is this worth it'?"
<P>
<DD>Just after she left the podium, NBC's Maria Shriver asked her: "This has 
been a difficult couple of years for you. Did that applause, the way 
you've been treated here, the way people have been reacting to you, kind 
of make it all go away?" And: "You are credited with really redefining 
the role of First Lady and for doing that, you've taken a lot of heat, a 
lot of criticism. As you look back, do you wished you'd redefined it a 
little less?"
<P>
<DD>On CBS, Bob Schieffer inquired of her: "Weren't you a little offended 
when he [Bob Dole] made the reference he did [to your book]?" CNN's Wolf 
Blitzer echoed: "What goes through your mind when you hear some of these 
bitter attacks against you?"

<h2>News Bites</h2>
<CENTER><h3>From the October 1996 Media Watch</h3></CENTER>
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Extreme Agreement.</B> 
<P>
Tagging Republican House freshmen as extremists is Democratic mantra. And, it's an
assessment endorsed by CBS News. On the October 10 Evening News, Bob Schieffer examined the Ohio re-match between GOP rookie Frank Cremeans and the man he beat in 1994, Democrat Ted Strickland. Schieffer found a GOP official who thought Newt Gingrich had gone "too far" and asked him a question that incorporated the Democratic spin on last year's budget showdown: "Where did he make his mistake? In shutting down the government?" Strickland insisted that "people want moderation and when extremes are presented, whether they be from the left or the right, I think people have a tendency to turn away from that." Schieffer then concluded by endorsing the "extreme" assessment: "Obvious perhaps, but as Fall comes to the heartland and the election draws near, dozens of Republican freshmen are running scared, wondering if it's a lesson they learned in time."
<P>
<B>Crediting Clinton. </B>
<P>
For the media, bad news is usually good news. Right? Well, not when the good news helps Bill Clinton. On June 30, The New York Times reported that "the share of national income earned by the top five percent of households grew at a faster rate than during the eight years of the Reagan administration, which was often characterized as favoring the rich." ABC's World News Tonight ran no story. But on September 26, when the Census Bureau reported that median income had risen as poverty fell, who got the credit? Bill Clinton.
<P>
Reporter Barry Serafin reported that median income grew 2.7 percent, but remained lower than 1989. Serafin started his story: "The number of Americans living in poverty fell. There were 36.4 million people below the poverty level, 1.6 million fewer than the year before. The poverty rate for African-Americans dropped to its lowest level since 1959, 29.3 percent.
<P>
What does it add up to?"
<P>
Following a soundbite from Clinton, Serafin continued: "Citing the income gains, the
President declared that the country is on the right track. He heralded progress on narrowing
the gap between the richest and poorest Americans." Serafin used a single expert source for
his story, a professor from MIT. Whom did the professor credit? Clinton and Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan. Serafin closed the story: "All in all the new numbers added to a very good
day for Bill Clinton." Thanks to ABC.
<P>
<B>Gore: Too Important to Criticize.  </B>
<P>
If you are powerful enough to get between a microphone and Clinton then you're personal
hypocrisy doesn't matter. At least that's what a CBS story portrayed. 

During the Democratic convention in Chicago Vice President Al Gore was widely praised by reporters for his emotional attack of tobacco by highlighting his sister's death from lung
cancer in 1984. On CBS Bob Schieffer called it "a barnburner." However, reporters failed to recognize that in 1988, four years after his sister died, Gore made an enthusiastic appeal to voters in tobacco states by stressing his own efforts in growing tobacco. 
<P>
The October 3 CBS Evening News included a profile of Gore by Rita Braver. For the first
time, CBS viewers heard about Gore's hypocrisy, but Braver excused him."He's in on every key White House meeting and decision. Just last month in his role as environmental guru, Gore convinced the President to create a controversial national monument in Utah. Of late, Republicans have attacked him for making a convention speech about his sister's death from lung cancer caused by smoking...While for several years after her death he let tobacco be grown on land he owned." But instead of seeing this as a character flaw, Braver relayed Gore's spin about how he "dismisses that attack as politics, an attempt to sully a man so close to the President he feels free to interrupt him." Viewers then saw video of Gore stepping in front of Clinton at a microphone. 
<P>
<B>Media to Dole: Just Stay Home. </B>
<P>
Is it wrong for a presidential candidate to address an ideological political organization?
Only if it's a conservative one.
<P>
When Bob Dole spoke September 14 to the Christian Coalition, on the NBC Nightly News David Bloom was concerned: "Dole decided only this morning to speak to the Christian Coalition despite worries inside his campaign that a bow to the religious right might send the wrong message to moderate, swing voters....Clinton's campaign spokesman said in a statement:
`Watching Bob Dole arm in arm with Pat Robertson speaks volumes to the extreme agenda being pursued by the Dole-Kemp-Gingrich team.' A top Clinton campaign official was all smiles, saying, `if you see Dole, tell him thanks for me.'" 
<P>
But although Clinton was not criticized for refusing to speak at the same Coalition meeting, NBC cast in racial terms Dole's July 10 decision to decline the NAACP's speaking invitation. Back then reporter Jim Miklaszewski claimed the group considered it <blockquote>
"an insult to African-American voters....By not showing up here, Bob Dole may reinforce those racial divides along party lines and fuel the anxiety among some Republicans that in this presidential campaign, Bob Dole may not be up to the challenge." 
</blockquote>
<P>
<B>Christian Contradiction. </B>
<P>
Following David Bloom's piece chastising Dole's  Christian Coalition speech, Brian Williams claimed the Coalition was "no longer the lone voice for conservative Christians." What new group of conservative Christians had NBC discovered?
<P>
Bob Abernethy described a group "uncomfortable" with the Coalition's "partisanship and with what seems to many critics its divisiveness and its neglect of the poor." Abernethy
described the new group's agenda as a "new kind of political action that defends the poor
and brings people together." But at their convention, they "heard from children right's
advocate Marian Wright Edelman," and Christian Marxist Jim Wallis. 
<P>
The group, Call To Renewal, hardly fits Williams' "conservative" label. Yet Abernethy didn't apply a single liberal label, even though "children's advocate" Edelman's speech garnered applause for this line: "Let's guarantee a job. Let's guarantee health care and children care. Let's turn this welfare repeal into real welfare reform." 
<P>
Abernethy simply described Wallis as "Reverend," but in the past Wallis has voiced hope that "more Christians will view the world through Marxist eyes." By failing to disclose Call To Renewal's ideological agenda, Abernethy committed sin by omission. 
<P>
<B>Media Flew the Koop. </B>
<P>
Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop endorsed the Clinton health care scheme early on, making him a ubiquitous presence on the networks. Koop made news again when he criticized Bob Dole for suggesting nicotine is not addictive. He appeared on Good Morning America and was featured in stories on other networks castigating Dole. In the infamous July interview in which Dole and Katie Couric sparred over liberal bias, Couric cited Koop: "C. Everett Koop is pretty nonpartisan wouldn't you say? He criticized you quite severely for your comments. You're saying the liberal media had a problem but even Dr. Koop had a problem."
<P>
But when Koop criticized President Clinton for vetoing in April the partial-birth abortion
ban passed by Congress, he fell into TV's memory hole. The former Surgeon General did not appear on any network to talk about his condemnation of the President. The lesson? When a nationally known figure announces he is for a liberal proposal, he is much in demand by the media. When the same figure comes out in support of a conservative cause, the media silence is overwhelming. 
<P>
<B>Dole Behind: Blame Conservatives. </B>
<P>
Conservatives argue that Bob Dole's lack of identity with issues that excite conservatives
explained why he failed to early on secure his Republican base. But more than a month before the election, ABC's Dean Reynolds instead assigned Dole's low standing in the polls to his being "too conservative." For the September 23 World News Tonight Reynolds traveled to Lansing, Michigan where he found that "many of the voters we spoke with blame Gingrich for last year's government shutdown, for a  would be the environmental President and today he went to the Grand Canyon. It was a trip critics charged was nothing more than grand standing." Reporter Ann Compton opened her story: "This morning there was only a slight haze drifting through the Grand Canyon, so the South Rim was a picture perfect spot for President Bush to claim an environmental victory, but on many days smog from a nearby power plant makes it impossible to see across to the Canyon walls just two miles away." Who did Compton use for a soundbite? Then Senator Al Gore.
<P>
What a difference a President makes. When President Clinton and Vice President Gore visited the Grand Canyon exactly five years later to designate 1.7 million acres in Southern Utah as a national monument, no network used this photo op as a chance to tear apart Clinton's environmental record, quite the contrary. On the CBS Evening News, reporter Rita Braver started her story: 
<blockquote>"With Al `Earthman' Gore by his side, the President signed a bill
designating 1.7 million acres of land 70 miles away in Utah as the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument." 
</blockquote>
ABC's Sam Donaldson was no different: 
<blockquote>"Dressed in appropriate western attire, boots and blue blazers, the top guns of the Democratic team came to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon to make points as conservationists."

<BR>
<B>Clinton's Character Off Limits--
Networks Declare Dole Criticisms "Mean," "Harsh" and "Nasty"</b> 
<P>
The networks spent early October on referee patrol for Bill Clinton, ruling out of bounds
anything critical or negative about him. <I>World News Tonight</I> anchor Forest Sawyer announced October 3: 
<blockquote>"Bob Dole decided to step onto center stage with a harshly worded attack not only on the administration's work in the Middle East, but its entire foreign policy....The administration has so far answered softly." The "soft" response? ABC didn't show it, but Clinton Press Secretary Mike McCurry retorted that Dole advisers are "nattering naysayers of gloom."
</blockquote>
<P>
MSNBC's <I>The News</I> with Brian Williams that night showed new ads from the Dole and Clinton campaigns: "We're going to begin with the latest ad from the Dole campaign which takes the campaign into a bit of nasty territory." Dole's ad simply showed clips of Clinton talking about taxes to illustrate he's really a liberal. Williams failed to tag the Clinton ad as
"nasty," but it included this negative attack line: "Dole and Gingrich tried to slash school
anti-drug programs. They'd take us back."
<P>
Bozo became the big news on October 8. A man in a crowd yelled at Dole that he should "get Bozo out of the White House." Dole shot back: "Bozo's on his way out." CNN's Bernard Shaw opened <I>Inside Politics</I>: "Was he borrowing the words of an over-enthusiastic supporter, or did Bob Dole lower the level of civility a notch in his contest with Bill Clinton?"
<P>
On the next morning's Today, Katie Couric asked NBC's Tim Russert: "As you've heard Tim it turned decidedly nastier in the Dole camp yesterday. He was talking about a moral crisis. He refused to answer a question if President Clinton was morally and ethically capable of being President. You heard that Bozo exchange. Effective strategy or is this going to come back to haunt him?" Swift network condemnation followed Dole's October 14 decision to raise the ethics issue. On NBC <I>Nightly News</I> David Bloom declared: "In his harshest, most personal attack yet on the President, Bob Dole today charged that the Clinton Administration is unethical, that Bill Clinton himself is slipping and sliding away from questions about possible illegal campaign contributions." The next day Dole again discussed what he termed "public ethics," leading CBS reporter Phil Jones to worry that Dole "runs the risk of looking desperate and mean-spirited."
<P>
Dole's speech prompted Matt Lauer to begin his <I>Today</I> newscast on October 16, the morning of the second debate: "Bob Dole is not waiting for that debate to attack Bill Clinton's ethics. With more on a campaign that is now getting meaner, NBC's Kelly O'Donnell is standing by live."

<B>Media Scoff at Far Right...Buy Wacky Left</B>
<P>
While the media are quick to dismiss crazy right-wing conspiracy theories about black U.N. helicopters they granted credence to the charge that the CIA introduced crack into black Los Angeles neighborhoods as a way to fund the Nicaraguan Contras. The theory was forwarded in an August San Jose Mercury News series by reporter Gary Webb. The four major networks aired a total of 12 stories with CBS laying claim to five. CNN ran three followed by ABC and NBC which aired two stories each. 
<P>
ABC's Good Morning America and CBS This Morning brought on far-left U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters. She pushed the charge as proof that outside forces created urban drug addicts. CBS's Bill Whitaker accepted the charge and placed the plight of crack babies at the feet of the CIA. His October 1 Evening News piece opened with a shot of woman holding a crying baby:
<blockquote>
"The decade and a half crack epidemic has exacted a ruinous toll. For ten years Eloise
Dangerfield has been rescuing the littlest victims, crack babies, from the death grip in
which the drug has ensnared much of South Central Los Angeles....So when L.A.'s black
citizens heard of the San Jose Mercury News reports claiming CIA backed Contras opened the first pipeline for Colombian cocaine to their communities their first reaction: shock. Their second: anger." 
</blockquote>
Whitaker aired a soundbite from Webb's source, a drug dealer, but offered this ambiguous defense of the CIA: 
<blockquote>"There is no evidence directly linking the CIA to the drug sales and the CIA says its own internal investigation has found no connection. Yet here at Ground Zero of the crack explosion the story simply won't go away." 
</blockquote>
<P>
He ended with more emotion over reason:
<P>
<blockquote>
"Eloise Dangerfield says it is all too horrible to contemplate. Knowing might ease the pain,
she says, but it won't end the suffering."
</blockquote>
<P>
In the September 30 Weekly Standard Tucker Carlson questioned Webb's reporting:

"Webb came up with no evidence to support his claim ....Instead of actual evidence, Webb relies on a series of unrelated events to show a conspiracy was afoot." Carlson noted that Sen. John Kerry's two year investigation failed to prove CIA involvement. "Indeed ample evidence surfaced that CIA officials had worked to remove drug traffickers from the Nicaraguan resistance."

<B>Wall of Denial Breaks Down--Media Actually Admit Bias</B>
<P>
Sam Donaldson, USA Today's Richard Benedetto and the Chairman of CBS all agree: the media are biased. 
<P>
With Brit Hume out ill for a few days, Donaldson returned to the campaign trail for the
first time since Reagan's years. And he found things have changed, USA Today's Peter Johnson reported September 23: "Have the boys on the bus lost the fire in their bellies, the one that fueled their cries of `Mr. President! Mr. President!' during President Reagan's years in office? ABC's Sam Donaldson isn't saying, exactly, but suspects something's going on.
<P>
Except for CBS' Rita Braver, `I have heard no reporter trying to ask the President any
question,' Donaldson said....
<P>
"What's this, Sam? Reporters going easy on Clinton? `You're not going to get me in a fight with these guys. They're my friends,' said Donaldson, who covered the White House from 1977 to 1989. `But there seems to a change in attitude or a different attitude toward covering the President.'"
<P>
A USA Today reporter concurs. In his "Politics" column the same day, Richard Benedetto
wrote: "As President Clinton's re-election campaign rolled through six states in four days
last week, it did so virtually unimpeded by a White House press corps known for setting up roadblocks now and then....He was left free to make a string of feel-good speeches that won great play in the media and gave the desired impression that the Clinton campaign is on a roll.... "In 1992, a tough White House press corps rightly kept President Bush's feet to the fire on domestic issues he would rather have downplayed. But the 1996 crew appears less aggressive with Clinton."
<P>
The realization of media bias extends to the top of CBS. Michael Jordan, the Chairman of
Westinghouse, parent of CBS, revealed in a magazine profile that he agrees with CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg's charge that network reporting tilts left.
<P>
In a Wall Street Journal op-ed back in February Goldberg cited a specific CBS story to
support his contention that "the old argument that the networks and other 'media elites'
have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore." CBS
reaction at the time: "It's such a wacky charge," commented a baffled Bob Schieffer. CBS
News President Andrew Heyward called the charge "absurd," took Goldberg off the air for two months and then canceled his bylined CBS Evening News feature, "Bernard Goldberg's America."
<P>
In the Summer Forbes MediaCritic, Terry Eastland found that in a May <i>USAir Magazine</i> profile, Jordan sided with Goldberg: "I think his criticism is fair. I think all the networks can do a better job at providing a more objective and balanced perspective." Now, if only Jordan would put his concerns into action.

<CENTER><H2>Networks Blackout Clinton's Bad News</H2>
<H3>Revelation After Revelation Reported by Newspapers, But Never Make TV News</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<BR>
On September 26, the House ethics committee announced it would expand an investigation of Speaker Newt Gingrich's college course "Renewing American Civilization." ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC reported the story, ultimately adding up to eleven broadcast network morning and evening segments in five days. The next morning, NBC's Today led off with an interview with NBC Washington Bureau Chief Tim Russert, who proclaimed: "It's awful, it's serious, it's potentially devastating." On October 8, Today's Matt Lauer asked Gingrich six questions about ethics, including two about whether Gingrich would resign. But a MediaWatch review of recent scoops on the Clinton administration's character shows a much different approach to stories which could damage Democrats.   
<P>
<BR>
<B>September 23:</B> The Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation's inspector general concluded that Hillary Clinton had drafted a real estate
document with the intent to "deceive" federal regulators. That real estate transaction, a
sham deal selling a property named Castle Grande to a straw buyer, later cost taxpayers $4 million in the bailout of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan. The Washington Post put the news on its September 24 front page. Network coverage? Nothing -- until October 4, when NBC's Jim Miklaszewski mentioned it in a Nightly News story on a speech by independent counsel Ken Starr: "Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr was invited to appear by outspoken Clinton critic Pat Robertson and the audience was very conservative. The White House claims that's proof Starr is out to get Clinton for political reasons, but Starr says he'll stay the course."
<P>
(ABC and CNN did report the story last February 29, when the FDIC released a more favorable assessment, recommending the FDIC not seek legal recourse against Mrs. Clinton or the Rose Law Firm.)
<P>
<BR>
<B>September 24:</B> A House committee held hearings on charges that the administration has let criminals become citizens. The Washington Times story the next day began: "Immigration workers yesterday told a House Government Reform and Oversight subcommittee of rampant abuses in the Citizenship USA program that apparently let thousands of immigrants with criminal records become citizens." The networks? Zilch until the October 18 CBS Evening News. Also on September 24, a federal jury convicted Sun Diamond Growers, one of the
nation's largest producers of fruits and nuts, of illegally showering former Clinton
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy with nearly $6,000 in gifts, a conviction for Independent
Counsel Donald Smaltz. The story made The Washington Post front page the next day. Network coverage? Nothing, but The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer on PBS did a brief anchor-read item.
<P>
<BR>
<B>September 25:</B> Sen. Orrin Hatch revealed a six-month gap in the log which listed who at the White House was accessing FBI background files on Republican White House employees. The Washington Times bannered the news across page one the next day. Coverage? A CNN World Today story and a mention on ABC's Good Morning America.
<P>
Also on the 25th, the Times reported that Rep. John Mica (R.-Fla.) sent a letter to
Clinton's "drug czar" demanding release of a four-month-old Institute for Defense Analysis
report that concluded Bush's interdiction policy was far more effective than Clinton's
emphasis on drug treatment. Network coverage? Nothing until a story by David Martin on the October 15 CBS Evening News.

September 26: Three days after President Clinton refused to rule out pardons for Whitewater figures on The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, 170 members of Congress, including three Democrats, sent a letter to the White House demanding Clinton promise not to pardon anyone. The September 29 Washington Times reported that House Democrats were prepared to shut down the government if Republicans demanded a vote on a resolution calling for President Clinton to renounce pardons. Network coverage? With the exception of one general question on the 29th about pardons from CBS Evening News Sunday anchor John Roberts to commentator Laura Ingraham, absolutely nothing until Dole raised the subject later.
<P>
<BR>
<B>October 1:</B> The White House claimed executive privilege to withhold from House investigators a memo to President Clinton from FBI Director Louis Freeh said to be highly critical of federal drug policy. Network response? Zero. 
<P>
<BR>
<B>October 4:</B> Sen. Orrin Hatch released the deposition of White House aide Mari Anderson before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Anderson verified that pages of the log used to record the taking of FBI files were missing. Anderson also asserted, in contra- diction to White House aide Craig Livingstone's assurances, that he knew they were procuring the FBI files of Republicans. Even The Washington Post put this story on its front page the next day. Network coverage? Only CNN, in two Linden Soles anchor-briefs on The World Today, mentioned the news. (ABC's World News Tonight didn't report it, but the revelations were raised in an interview on the October 6 This Week.)
 Also on October 4, former FBI Special Agent Dennis Sculimbrene, who was the senior agent assigned to the White House from 1986 to April 1996, told The Wall Street Journal: "There were senior people as well, senior aides and advisers to the President who used drugs recently -- people in policy positions, or say, the director of an office...Some senior
 people even said they had used drugs as recently as the Inaugural." Sculimbrene estimated that "about 25 percent of the incoming administration, about one out of four cases, had a problem with illegal drugs. Not just casual experimentation, but a pattern of usage." Network coverage? Zero. 
<P>
<BR>
<B>October 10:</B> A House panel investigating the Clinton administration's secret foreign policy initiative to encourage the Iranian government to arm the Bosnian Muslims asked the Justice Department to probe administration officials for possible criminal charges for false statements. Since the Iran-Bosnia secret foreign policy emerged in the Los Angeles Times April 5, CBS and NBC have aired absolutely nothing on the evening news about the story. CNN and ABC aired only anchor briefs, only in the first days of the story. Network coverage for the latest development? Zero.
<P>
On CNN's Crossfire Sept. 20, Chicago Tribune reporter Ellen Warren declared: "Reporters want nothing more, this year and four years ago, to have a horse race. That's what we're in love with, is the fight, the close call....So it's in our interest to make it look close, to make Bob Dole look good." The omissions documented here suggest otherwise.

<BR>
<B>Clinton: Moral Leader</B>
<P>
The chief White House speechwriter got his job because candidate Bill Clinton so liked his
reporting. In the September 23 Weekly Standard, Christopher Caldwell relayed why chief
speechwriter Donald Baer,  who had been Assistant Managing Editor of U.S. News, was tapped in 1994: "Clinton liked the articles Baer contributed to U.S. News during the 1992 campaign" since "Baer wrote with extreme empathy about Clinton's background."
<P>
Caldwell quoted a journalistic colleague: "'Being of the South and still being rooted there,
yet being driven and ambitious enough to prove oneself in the larger world -- the two of
them have a lot in common.' While Baer has always been a loyal Democrat, he's not
necessarily a liberal. Like Clinton, he has an idiosyncratic, instinctive, generally 
progressive politics that winds up at beyond-left-and-rightism."
<P>
Beyond ideology maybe, but not beyond idolizing Clinton. Caldwell learned: "This enthusiasmcan appear like ideological non-commitment or caginess. One New Democrat who met Baer at a dinner last year described him as `bland beyond description, a fount of cliches. `Clinton was the moral leader of the Universe,' and all that.'"
<P>
<B>Up and Out at U.S. News</B>
<P>
James Fallows took the helm at U.S. News in late September. The new Editor promoted one veteran of Democratic politics while another decided to resign. Now in the number two slot as Managing Editor: Harrison Rainie, an Assistant Managing Editor since 1988 when he jumped from the office of New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan where he had spent most of 1987 as the Democrat's Chief-of-Staff.... 
<P>
Deciding to depart: Kathryn Bushkin, Director of Editorial Administration since 1984 when
she put in a stint as Press Secretary with Gary Hart's presidential effort. Bushkin has
joined a PR firm.
<P>
<B>NBC's on the Mark</B>
<P>
A professional flack for a liberal Senator is the newest member of the on-air reporting team
at the NBC News Washington bureau. Alexandra Marks, Press Secretary to Senator John Kerry
(D-Mass.) from late 1993 to mid-1995, signed on in early September. Before joining Kerry and
again since 1995 Marks worked as a Christian Science Monitor reporter. But she's not new to TV. Prior to flacking for Kerry, Marks reported for the Monitor's since-failed cable channel and for the 10 O'Clock News on WGBH-TV, Boston's PBS station.
<P>
<B>Democratic Cable</B>
<P>
Among the on-air talent brought aboard MSNBC, the new NBC News cable channel in partnership with Microsoft, were a Clinton speechwriter and an aide in a Democratic presidential run.
<P>
Political correspondent Eric Liu composed speeches for Secretary of State Warren Christopher in 1993 before becoming, at age 25, the youngest speechwriter for President Clinton. The New York Times reported that Liu moved to the White House speechwriting office in November 1993 where he toiled until June 1994.... Chip Reid, hired to cover the White House and Capitol Hill, was general counsel in 1987 for Democrat Joe Biden's unsuccessful run. For theprevious four years Reid had been chief investigator for the Senate Judiciary Committee's Democratic Senators. After Biden, Reid accepted a producer slot with ABC News and was a reporter for Washington, D.C.'s ABC affiliate, WJLA, when tapped by MSNBC.

<title>Janet Cooke Award April 1996</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>
Janet Cooke Award <BR>
For the October 1996 Mediawatch. 
</h2></center>

<i>The Janet Cooke Award is given to the most outrageously distorted news story of the month. The award honors the Washington Post reporter who won the Pulitzer Prize for a story later proven completely false.</i>
<p>
<CENTER><B>Clinton Doesn't Get Enough Credit
<BR>
PBS Special Argues Media Out of Touch, But Show Proves PBS Out of Touch with Reality</B>
<P>
</CENTER>
Civility was not the rule at PBS when Frontline asserted the Reagan administration had
funneled drugs into American cities to fund the Contras, that Reagan's CIA attempted to kill Contra leader Eden Pastora, or that the 1980 Reagan campaign conspired to delay the release of the Iranian hostages. Congressional investigations later unraveled these conspiracy theories with no apologies from PBS. But now that Bill Clinton is President, PBS has funded --  without any rebuttal -- Hedrick Smith's four-hour documentary on how Washington works, <B>The People and the Power Game</B>.
<P> 
For devoting his first hour on September 3 to his claim that Bill Clinton has been abused by an uncivil news media, Smith earned the Janet Cooke Award.
Smith began: 
<blockquote>
	"By focusing on scandal and conflict over substance, and by our increasingly
	negative tone, the media has distorted the nation's agenda and lost touch with the 	public we claim to serve." 
</blockquote>
But Smith made only two brief asides about coverage of conservatives: how
reporters drilled Steve Forbes with personal or tactical questions on Meet the Press, while
average people asked questions of substance; and Newt Gingrich complaining about the
"childhood games" reporters played at his press conferences. Smith introduced Gingrich: "A politician on the make knows that the sure way to command press attention is with
sensationalism and extremist polemics. Newt Gingrich, as a junior Congressman, built his
power on media fireworks." The rest of the hour brought example after example of scandalous Clinton coverage, from the supposed $200 haircut with Cristophe on Air Force One, to New York Times reporter Maureen Dowd: "President Clinton returned today for a sentimental journey to the university where he didn't inhale, didn't get drafted, and didn't get a degree." 
<P>
<B>Gennifer Flowers.</B>
<P> 
Smith decried the networks "going with a questionable story that almost felled a future President." Smith never investigated the substance of the Flowers
story, choosing instead to force anchors to defend themselves for even touching it. But
Smith's version was at variance with the actual record. He reported ABC's Jim Wooten asked Clinton about the Star's Flowers story on Thursday, January 23, but decided not to air a story. ABC's local affiliates did -- as did Nightline, which booked three guests decrying the story as tabloid trash. Smith claimed: "By the next day, ABC's <I>World News Tonight</I>, lagging behind its own affiliates, decided to broadcast the story." 
<P>
Smith asked Peter Jennings: "In this instance, you tried it [to check the story out] on the first day, and on the basis of that standard, you didn't run it...With not much different facts the second day, you did run it." Replied Jennings: "Yeah. I think that's a fair and slightly painful characterization for me. But the truth of the matter is that by the second day, we were pretty much swept along by events." Smith then interviewed Dan Rather: "I said `Gosh, I don't have the stomach for doing that. And the first day, even the second day, we said `Nah, not for me.' I mean, frankly, I don't care, and I don't think most viewers care. And then somebody came in and said `Look at this. Last night, one of our major competitors, they went with it, they went with it strong,' and that bridges over from the sleazy press into the mainstream." But any look at the tapes of ABC's World News Tonight demonstrates that they aired no story on January 24, the day after Nightline, but waited until the 27th -- after the Clintons had appeared in an exclusive post-Super Bowl interview on 60 Minutes. And for Rather's version of events -- that a competitor "went with it strong" -- seems strange since he waited until 60 Minutes did the story. Only NBC's Lisa Myers made passing reference to the Flowers story before that.
<P>
<B>Brit Hume</B>.
<P>
 Smith claimed: "The once-cozy relationship between the President and the White
House press corps has dissolved into permanent combat...Increasingly, critics argue, the
balance is out of whack, and the traditional skepticism of the White House press corps has slid into cynicism, where a President's thoughtful deliberation is seen as indecision and compromise as backsliding." What kind of cynical question did Smith have in mind? When Clinton appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court after long considering Stephen Breyer, ABC's Brit Hume asked Clinton: "We may have created an impression, perhaps unfair, of a certain zig-zag in the decision making process here. I wonder if you could walk us through it and perhaps disabuse of any notions we might have along these lines. Thank you." 
<P>
Eric Engberg. The CBS reporter may have been criticized by colleague Bernard Goldberg for attacking Steve Forbes' flat tax, but Smith was only concerned about Clinton: "Critics
contend that Engberg's Reality Checks have gone beyond investigative journalism and become saturated with opinion, almost always negative...Just seven days after Clinton's
inauguration, for example, Engberg was on the air with a Reality Check declaring the infant administration a failure."
<P>
But Engberg's actual report never came close to "declaring the infant administration a
failure." Engberg noted Clinton had not followed through on promises to have plans on the
economy and energy available "on the first day" of his presidency. Engberg also brought up news reports that the White House was considering a gas tax, recalling Clinton ruled out raising taxes on the middle class in 1992. Engberg concluded: "Overall, the first week
showed the President willing to jump into controversies that can slice away some of his
early support. The promise to focus on the economy like a laser seemed to come unstuck in the Washington centrifuge."   

CBS's State of the Union. Smith declared: "CBS and others in the Washington media were
criticized for relying on inside-the-Beltway punditry in their coverage of Clinton's State
of the Union address." The program quoted Joe Klein saying: "It was a very, very long
speech. This guy loves to give long speeches." He left out Klein's next sentence: "But it
was also a very effective one."

Smith rebutted Klein: "But polls showed the public loved it." Where would Smith have learned
that polls showed the public loved it? CBS aired its instant poll results showing that 85
percent "approve of the President's proposals," that 74 percent "now have a clear idea what
President Clinton stands for" and 56 percent said Clinton "better understands the major
problems facing the country today" than the GOP. Rather signed off by repeating all the
pro-Clinton poll results.

Taxpayers fund public broadcasting to be offered an alternative to the commercial networks.
Smith's program shows taxpayers aren't getting an alternative, but are paying for PBS to
scold the media on how they're not liberal enough.

<title>Newsbites -- November 1996 Media Watch</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3>Newsbites from the November 1996 Media Watch</h3>
<p>
<b>California's Clock</b>
<BR>
NBC's Maria Shriv-er and CBS's Jane Robelot laid into the California Civil Rights
Initiative, Proposition 209, after it passed by a wide margin on November 5. The measure
banned the state from awarding preferential treatment to anyone on the basis of race, sex,
or religion -- to liberal reporters, an obvious step backwards. Shriver tossed Jesse Jackson
a loaded softball on election night: "Affirmative action was a hotbed issue in this country,
still a big race on that subject going on about that in California. Did you feel at times
like we've turned back the clock on some of these issues?" On CBS This Morning the next day,
Robelot attacked initiative sponsor Ward Connerly for touting an end  to preferences: "But
that's sort of living in an ideal world. I mean it's nice to say it on paper. If you look
around at corporate offices in America and in CEO's offices, you're gonna see very few
minorities and few women. Are we really ready to backtrack on civil rights now, or on
affirmative action?"
<P>
<b>Gore vs. Gingrich</b>
<BR>
Rarely have the media's double standard toward the two parties been more evident than in the
Today show's interviews in the first week in October. On October 8, substitute co-host Matt
Lauer hit Newt Gingrich with six ethics questions, including: "Do you envision any
circumstances, Mr. Speaker, under which you might be forced to resign based on the
investigation?....So if the ethics committee comes back and says Newt Gingrich was not
truthful with us in supplying information?" Gingrich responded: "I don't think they can say
that." Lauer eagerly countered, "If they did, would you consider resigning?" The next
morning, substitute co-host Ed Gordon tossed bouquets at Al Gore: "Many can see that you
have indeed been the most powerful Vice President in our history. You satisfied with the
role that you played for four years?" And: "The debate is coming up. What do you want people
to come away with, after they watch you and Jack Kemp? What should they know about Al Gore?"
Gordon  also asked: "You want to be the best second guy you can. You're there to help the
President. Now having said that, do you want the job in 2000?"
<P>
<b>Cuddling Carolyn</b> 
<BR>
The national media have never been in love with the National Rifle Association, so when
anti-gun Democrat Carolyn McCarthy beat freshman Republican Rep. Daniel Frisa in New York,
media praise soon followed. The morning after the election, McCarthy made the talk show
rounds. On the November 6 Today, Katie Couric went straight to the NRA: "What do you think
the lesson is for the National Rifle Association? Of course, one of the cornerstones of your
campaign was to maintain the ban on assault weapons in this country." Over on Good Morning
America, ABC's Joan Lunden claimed: "McCarthy turned her rage over the availability of
assault weapons into political activism and last night this ultimate outsider, a former
nurse and homemaker, defeated incumbent Daniel Frisa." After McCarthy, who has never held
political office, made some broad comments about various government programs, Lunden praised
her: "Sounds like you really educated yourself too. Are you at all daunted by this task that
lies before you?" On November 8, World News Tonight picked McCarthy as the Person of the
Week because, as anchor Peter Jennings put it: "We have chosen her because the people who
chose her were so impressed by her notion of public service." McCarthy was the first
politician selected as Person of the Week this year.
<P>
<b>Hating Helen</b>
<BR>
GOP freshman Rep. Helen Chenoweth won re-election despite being targeted by the Democrats,
labor unions, environmentalists and...Tom Brokaw. On the October 24 NBC Nightly News, Brokaw
chose Chenoweth's Idaho congressional race as the subject of his "In Depth" report on big
money from special interests. Brokaw opened: "From sunup til late night, the sounds of
politics are in the air in Idaho like a migraine headache with a voice track. And this is
why: Helen Chenoweth, a controversial first term Republican Congresswoman." When Chenoweth
claimed: "I don't have a clue why they would target me. I come from an innocuous state. I'm
just a plain-spoken Western woman," Brokaw countered: "Not exactly. In her first term
Chenoweth was a cheerleader for the New Right. Voting against an increase in the minimum
wage, trashing traditional environmental organizations. She was a hard-liner on gun laws.
So, she is a target of big labor and conservationists." While Chenoweth was labeled as a
"hard-liner" and portrayed as extreme, her Democratic opponent Dan Williams drew no labeling
from Brokaw, nor was he depicted as being beholden to special interests, despite the
thousands of dollars big labor and liberal environmentalists spent on his behalf.  
<P>
<b>Return of the Gorbasm</b>
<BR>
  <DD>NBC's Tom Brokaw has put Mikhail Gorbachev in his personal pantheon of heroes. On the PBS
  talk show Charlie Rose May 2, Brokaw paid homage: "I think Gorbachev is a great man in the
  20th century because he forced his country to look at the hypocrisy and the fraudulence of
  communism and to begin slowly to make a turn away from it.  He can still light up any room
  that he walks into." Brokaw refused to call Ronald Reagan a great man: "You can look at
  the economics of Reaganism, for example, or some of the bombast of his foreign policy, and
  find all manner of flaws in there."
<BR>
Five months later, on MSNBC's InterNight October 29, Brokaw interviewed Gorbachev,
proclaiming: "It's likely that your view of Mikhail Gorbachev depends on your point of view.
From the perspective of the West, the former President of the Soviet Union of course was a
courageous, far-seeing prophet whose reforms set in motion the collapse of the Soviet
dictatorship and the end of the Cold War." At interview's end, Brokaw gushed: "Perhaps one
day we'll see you again in political office in Russia. We know that you've devoted your life
to peace and to changing your country and those of us who have gotten to know you count
ourselves among the privileged."
<P>
<b>Willie Horton Stalks Cyberspace</b>
<br>
For eight years reporters regularly insisted Republicans used racial issues, as symbolized
by the Willie Horton ad, to divide America in order to win the 1988 presidential campaign.
But this year, raising Willie Horton suddenly had become a symbol of toughness for one
politician. In a VP debate preview piece posted October 8 on the CNN website
AllPolitics.com, reporters Bob Franken and Marc Watts applauded the use of Willie Horton by
Al Gore in 1988: "Gore can also fire off the tough question. In 1988, as a Senator, he first
raised what became known as the `Willie Horton issue' with Michael Dukakis during a primary
debate." A dimmer view was advanced by CNN in a February 1992 special on race and the
presidential campaigns. CNN reporter Ken Bode sounded off about the pro-George
Bush independent expenditure ads featuring Willie Horton: "David Duke's exploitation of white
working class fears about blacks echoes a theme from the 1988 election. This is the Maryland
State Penitentiary. Inside resides the most politically notorious convict in America.
William Horton, Jr., the focal point of a major national campaign designed to exploit white
fear of black crime....The Horton case illustrates the readiness of political leaders to
exploit the racial divide."
<P>
<b>Peter's Slippery Science</b>
<BR>
Scientific studies usually get a respectful hearing -- unless reporters disagree with the
results. Take Peter Jennings  on the October 11 World News Tonight: "There was a study
released at Penn State University today that you may hear a lot about this weekend. It
purports to show a connection between women who have had abortions and the risk of
developing breast cancer. And if you see it around, remember this. It is not original
research, but an analysis of 23 earlier studies. And the National Cancer Institute says
those individual studies were actually inconclusive, and  because of that, various other
scientists say today the Penn State report is flawed." Some criticism of the study attacked
the author, Joel Brind, who is personally opposed to abortion. 
<P>
 But in the past Jennings has had no such doubts about the validity of meta-analysis, a
 method of research which draws conclusions by combining data from other studies. In a
 syndicated column, Reason magazine Science Editor Michael Fumento pointed out that a 1991
 report, by Dr. Stanton Glantz, an anti-smoking activist and founder of the American
 Nonsmoker's Rights Foundation, found a "30 percent increased risk," the same factor of
 increase as found in the recent breast cancer study. On January 9, 1991 Jennings had no
 disclaimers for the secondhand smoke study: "A new warning today about the dangers of
 passive smoking, breathing someone else's cigarette smoke. A report in the American Heart
 Association journal Circulation says passive smoking kills an estimated 53,000 people every
 year."
<P>
<b>Civil Rights or Social Programs?</b>
<BR>
 Opening an October 20 New York Times story reporter Steven Holmes declared: "In his nearly
 four years in office, President Clinton has amassed a civil rights record rivaling that of
 any President in the last 30 years." His proof? Clinton "stoutly defended the government's
 affirmative action role." 
<P>
But the newspaper's style manual apparently contains a broad definition of the phrase "civil
rights." Holmes laid out what he considered to be Clinton's 1992 campaign promises
concerning civil rights: "Work to pass the Motor Voter bill" and "support statehood for the
District of Columbia." Plus two items with no relation to discrimination or voting: "Require
every employer to spend 1.5 percent of payroll for continuing education and training," and
"expand the Earned Income Tax Credit." Expanding the definition let Holmes give Clinton
credit for two "civil rights achievements" that passed, Motor Voter and the Earned Income
Tax Credit. 
<P>
<b>Depraved Clinton</b>
<BR>
 Newsweek Washington Bureau Chief Evan Thomas  had a change of heart on the credibility of
 Paula Jones. Prompted by former New York Times Supreme Court reporter Stuart Taylor's
 November article in The American Lawyer, on the November 3 Inside Washington, Thomas
 explained: "There are two friends of Paula Jones that she spoke to right after the alleged
 incident....Taylor has gone back and talked to them and they paint a pretty bad tale." Back
 on May 7, 1994 Thomas disparaged Jones as "some sleazy woman with big hair."
<P>
Taylor found that "the evidence supporting Paula Jones's allegations of predatory, if not
depraved, behavior by Bill Clinton is far stronger than the evidence supporting Anita Hill's
allegations of far less serious conduct by Clarence Thomas." In the three weeks after the
article appeared it didn't get a sentence in Newsweek or the other newsweeklies. Other than
a brief citation as an example of media bias by ABC's Jeff Greenfield on the October 31
World News Tonight, it drew not a second on the networks.
<p>
<b>Only One House?</b>
<br> 
Clinton has saved America's cities from the evil Reagan years, ABC News argued before the
election. Over video of a building being torn down, on the October 14 World News Tonight
ABC's Dean Reynolds asserted from Detroit: "Twenty five housing developments have started
here since the Clinton Administration took office." Following a soundbite from Detroit Mayor
Dennis Archer, Reynolds charged, without rebuttal, "A decade ago during the Reagan era,
according to the Mayor, only one new house was built in the entire city."

<h3>Bright Side, from the November 1996 Media Watch</h3>
<P>
<center><h2>Ross Stands Alone</h2></center>
<P>
<DD>With the revelations of questionable contributions to the Clinton campaign and the
Democratic Party, one would assume the media would be all over the story.  Not so. But ABC's
Brian Ross stood apart in October for focusing on Democratic fundraising. On the October 22
World News Tonight, Ross first put Jorge Cabrera, a twice convicted drug dealer who was
invited to the White House after giving $20,000 to the DNC, onto network TV: "As to how
Cabrera got inside the White House, the Democratic Party said today it did not know of his
criminal record and he had been referred to them as a prominent member of the Cuban-American
community in Monroe County, Florida. Tom Cash, the former top drug agent in Miami, says the
only thing prominent about Cabrera is his criminal record." Two days later Ross filed the
first broadcast network piece detailing John Huang's flight: "A federal judge ordered
Democratic Party lawyers into court and told them to produce John Huang to testify in a
civil lawsuit alleging favoritism at the Commerce Department for big Democratic
contributors." Ross showed how Huang could not be found and explained how he "was suspended
by the Democratic Party this week as a fundraiser when some of his contributions were found
to have been illegally given by people who were not U. S. citizens."
<P>
<center><h2>Ignored...Until Sunday</h2></center>
<P>
<DD>The network evening shows largely ignored Democratic financial scandal news, but two Sunday
shows picked up on them. On the October 13 Meet the Press host Tim Russert put VP Al Gore
off balance with his continual barrage of questions: "But isn't character a fair issue to
bring up? Why can't Republicans say, `Listen Bill Clinton promised, quote, the most ethical
administration in history, and it hasn't been that. Filegate, Travelgate, Whitewater.'" And,
"But what about the appearance, Mr. Vice President, of a gentleman, John Huang, working for
a Lippo Company, then joining the Commerce Department, where he works on their behalf,
lobbies on their behalf; then goes over to the DNC and raises money for them?" Russert even
noted "there's a perception the President is dangling pardons out there in order to silence
people." CNN's Frank Sesno pressed White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta on the October 27
Late Edition, questioning him about Ron Brown allegedly "selling seats" on his trade
missions. Sesno brought up how Huang "raises $4 to $5 milion from Asian-Americans, some of
it raised illegally. Money that came from South Korean business had to be returned. A
quarter of a million dollars, $400,000 from these Indonesian gardeners who since have gone
away....Where's the outrage from the White House?"

<h3>Page One from the November 1996 Media Watch</h3>
<p>
<center><h2>Whatever You Say, Mr. Clinton</h2></center>
<p>
<center><h2>Network Anchors Carry White House Spin that Voters Hate Investigations</h2></center>
<p>
<dd>Shortly after the election Clinton's aides told reporters that the voters wanted an end to
congressional investigations. They didn't have to convince reporters of anything. They
already agreed. NBC's Tom Brokaw noted on  election night: "There is also a theory, however,
that if the Republicans begin to engage once again in a lot of investigations that it will
not do well for them four years from now. Because the country in all the exit polling that
we're seeing so far is saying, `Hey let's get on with the business of solving the real
problems that we have out there.'"
<p>
<dd>Over on CBS, Dan Rather echoed Brokaw, asking Senator
Trent Lott: "True or false, that part of the Republican agenda is now to try to paralyze the
White House with so-called ethics inquiries?" The next morning, NBC Today substitute co-host
Matt Lauer asked RNC Chairman Haley Barbour: "Exit polls show us that the economy was still
the number one issue on people's mind last night. And although character and trust play a
role, people choose candidates based on their handling of the issues. With that in mind,
what do you say to people now who look to Republicans in Congress and say, `Hey, move
forward on key legislation. Don't get bogged down on investigations into the Clinton White
House?'"
<p>
<dd>When Sen. Al D'Amato announced he would back off his Whitewater probe in the
Senate, reporter Jim Miklaszewski concluded on the November 7 NBC Nightly News: "White House
officials are under no illusions and still expect Republicans to vigorously pursue
investigations on other fronts. But they're also encouraged that D'Amato's announcement may
signal an end to any high-profile political witch hunts." Tom Brokaw returned to his theme
on the November 7 Don Imus radio show, but added a new twist: it's in the Republican
leaders' self-interest to halt the investigations. He claimed "A lot of these new Republican
leaders, Trent Lott and others, have their own presidential aspirations four years from now.
They'll want to get things done because I think that's the underlying message from the
country here -- solve the problems. And yes there are some real problems within the
administration that need to be investigated, but there are agencies and ways of doing that
without tying up Congress in these expensive hearings." 
<p>
<dd>A post-election Pew Research Center
poll of voters determined that while thirty percent said Congress had "gone too far" in
investigating Clinton, the majority did not: 31 percent thought Congress had not gone far
enough and 35 percent indicated that "it has handled the matter about right." If only the
media were that evenly split.

<h3>Page Three from the November 1996 Media Watch</h3>
<p>
<center><h2>Networks Lay the Blame -- The GOP Shutdown?</h2></center>
<P>
<dd>The networks had a ready answer for why Bob Dole lost, suggesting it happened because the
public bought the Democratic spin that House Republicans were responsible for the government
shutdown. Of course, the media kept repeating that Democratic spin in its own reporting,
neglecting to mention that President Clinton refused to sign any budget resolution to keep
the government operating. It started before the election. On the October 18 World News
Tonight, ABC's Cokie Roberts relayed without challenge: "With the help of millions of
dollars from organized labor, Democratic challengers constantly remind voters that these
freshmen supported Newt Gingrich and that together they shut down the government."
<P>
 <dd>In a roundtable on the November 3 This Week with David Brinkley, ABC's Sam Donaldson asked
 fellow panel member George Will: "Are you going to shut down the government again? Did that
 strategy work?" (Donaldson repeated himself on election night, saying Dole's  loss wasn't
 his fault because Gingrich "helped engineer a shutdown" that "scared the country.") Looking
 back at the 1996 campaign on the November 4 This Morning, CBS's Bill Plante contemplated:
 "You think the campaign began here, at the Democrats' made for TV convention? No way. It
 really began with this year's State of the Union address. The President already knew he'd
 have no opponent in New Hampshire and the Republicans had just stumbled badly by shutting
 down the government."
<P>
<dd>The bias continued on election night. CNN's Bernard Shaw declared: "The Republican Party
actually helped William Jefferson Clinton in that comeback, especially when they voted to
shut down the Congress [sic]. The American people said they Republicans went too far. We did
not send you to Washington to shut down the federal government." On  the morning after the
election, CBS This Morning anchor Troy Roberts theorized: "Often abrasive, Gingrich never
mastered the fine art of compromise. Less than a year after he rode into Washington in
triumph, he was on the defensive. His gambit to shut down the government over the budget
backfired. Seizing the moment, President Clinton quickly became the voice of centrist
reason."

<center><h2>Media Highlight Brinkley -- But What About Them?</h2></center>
<p>
<dd>David Brinkley's election night comments that President Clinton is "a bore" and that his
acceptance speech delivered "goddamned nonsense" generated wide newspaper coverage. Brinkley
apologized to Clinton during a This Week interview, but other reporters have never
apologized or been condemned for comments about conservatives. NBC's Bryant Gumbel called
Pat Buchanan "Mr. Puke-anan" on the Feb. 20 Today. In 1994 he asked House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt: "You called Gingrich and his ilk, your words, `trickle-down terrorists who
base their agenda on division, exclusion and fear.' Do you think middle-class Americans are
in need of protection from that group?" On David Letterman in 1987, Sam Donaldson advised
how to measure President Reagan's success in an upcoming press conference: "I think he is
going to have to pass two or three tests. The first is, will he get there, stand in front of
the podium, and not drool." Just after the 1994 election Donaldson asked Speaker-to-be Newt
Gingrich on This Week: "A lot of people are afraid of you. They think you're a bomb-thrower.
Worse, you're an intolerant bigot. Speak to them." On a January, 1995 Sunday Morning John
Leonard declared: "From the pronunciamentos out of Washington, you'd think the new Congress
were a slash-and-burn Khmer Rouge." NPR/ABC reporter Nina Totenberg issued a death wish on
Inside Washington in 1995 after Sen. Jesse Helms said too much is spent on AIDS research: "I
think he ought to be worried about what's going on in the Good Lord's mind, because if there
is retributive justice, he'll get AIDS from a transfusion, or one of his grandchildren will
get it."

<title>In the Media -- November 1996 Media Watch</title>

<body>
<h3>In the Media from the November 1996 Media Watch</h3>
<p>
<center><h2>Slow Growth Hailed in '96</h2></center>
<p>
<center><h2>But Four Years Ago...</h2></center>
<p>
In late October 1992 the government announced the 3rd quarter GDP jumped up to 2.7 percent.
Four years later, on October 30, the 3rd quarter number fell to just 2.2 percent. But what
was bad news for Bush escaped such scorn this year with Bill Clinton in the Oval Office.
Indeed, NBC's Tom Brokaw positively spun this year's drop: "The economy was slow, but steady
going in the last quarter. Many economists were encouraged by that because it means
inflation is under control and interest rates will stay low."    On the CBS Evening News Ray
Brady noted: "There's one irony here. On election day 1992 the economy was starting to pick
up, but voters hadn't felt it yet. Remember that expression, `It's the economy stupid'? And
George Bush went down to defeat. On election day 1996 the economy seems to be slowing, but
not enough so that most voters will be feeling it." Why hadn't voters in 1992 "felt it"?
<P>
Maybe because Brady and his colleagues put a negative spin on 1992 economic news? On October
27, 1992, CBS reporter Susan Spencer filed from the Bush campaign: "He crowed today at
upbeat news of a third quarter growth rate of 2.7 percent, though some economists warned
that may not hold." She was correct, but not in the direction she thought. It was later
revised upward to 3.9 percent. On September 4, 1992 anchor Connie Chung led the show by
explaining: "The nation's unemployment rate is down slightly for the second month in a row.
But the latest decline is a result of a summer jobs program for teenagers. That program is
about to end, and as Ray Brady reports, the picture ahead is bleak." Brady concluded: "After
hitting a high of 7.8 percent for June, then dipping a tenth of a point again last month,
most economists now predict next month's jobless rate could hit 7.8 percent." 
<p>
One month
later, the rate fell from 7.6 to 7.5 percent. On the October 2, 1992 CBS Evening News Brady
skipped his mistake and offered a new reason to dismiss the good news: "Those unemployment
lines did become a bit shorter last month, but economists say that's largely because many
Americans simply stopped looking for work, so they're no longer counted as unemployed." CBS
wasn't the only culprit. On ABC's World News Tonight October 30 Peter Jennings gave equal
weight to both sides: "President Clinton...noted that many economists say a cooling off is
necessary to keep inflation down and therefore, he thinks, the numbers were good news.
Senator Dole on the other hand was in Tennessee earlier today, along with Mrs. Dole. He says
the numbers are cause for concern. He went on to say if Mr. Clinton is re-elected there
could be a recession." 
<p>
But four years ago Jennings insisted the 2.7 percent GDP is "more
than economists had projected, but in many cases, less than meets the eye." Bob Jamieson
then reported that "many economists say the report is not proof the economy is taking a
sharp turn for the better." The next day, October 28, 1992, Jennings warned: "The President
may complain about the news media, but the economic growth figures which he is so pleased
about are not that definitive, according to a great many independent economic analysts." All
this matches the Center for Media and Public Affairs finding that "In September, fully 91
percent of sources said the economy was healthy," but "in September 1992, 98 percent of all
sources on the [ABC, CBS and NBC] evening news criticized the state of the economy

<h3>Study from the November 1996 Media Watch</h3>
<p>
<center><h2>A Continuing Pattern of Omission</h2></center>
<p>
<center><h2>Network Anchors Carry White House Spin that Voters Hate Investigations</h2></center>
<p>
<DD>Six days after the election, Washington Post media reporter Howard Kurtz noted that several
print media outlets had pieces of the Democratic National Committee's foreign fundraising in
hand, but didn't think they had enough for a major story -- until the pieces came together
in the person of John Huang in October. Just as MediaWatch found last month, front-page
newspaper scoops failed to attract much network interest or intensity, even in the final
days of the campaign. A MediaWatch review of October morning (ABC, CBS, NBC) and evening
news coverage (ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN's The World Today) found the networks were slow or
missing in action on critical campaign stories in the last few weeks before the election.
<P>
<DD>The networks aired only 26 explanatory or investigative pieces by non-campaign
correspondents (8 on CNN, 7 on ABC, 6 on CBS, and 5 on NBC). To review the developments:
<ul>
<li><i>October 8:</i> The Wall Street Journal front page introduced the story of John Huang and his resume: the Lippo Group, an Asian conglomerate with ties to Little Rock, followed by Ron Brown's Commerce Department, and then the Democratic National Committee, where he raised large amounts from Asian donors. Network coverage? None. 
<li><i>October 14:</i> Three days after Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) called for an independent counsel to investigate and one day after Newt Gingrich said the Indonesian story "makes Watergate look tiny," two networks arrived on the story. ABC's Jackie Judd led off World News Tonight with it, while on CBS, Eric Engberg had the newscast's number two story. The morning shows had small mentions in their Clinton stories. 
<li><i>October 17:</i> The Washington Post reported on the front page that the DNC acknowledged a "mistake" in holding an $140,000 fundraiser at a Buddhist temple in April organized by John Huang and attended by Vice President Gore. Neither that nor an October 25 Post front-page follow-up drew a network news story. Also on October 17, ABC's Brian Ross investigated Yogesh Gandhi, a $325,000 donor to the DNC, noting he owed the state of California $10,000 in back taxes. which raised the question if the $325,000 was really his money, or someone else's. No other network developed this story. (None of Ross's reports were replayed on Good Morning America.) 
<li><i>October 19:</i> The Washington Post reported on its front page that the DNC removed Huang from his money-raising duties and asked the Federal Election Commission to investigate the legality of Huang-solicited contributions. All four networks ran about a sentence-long update in the middle of their campaign coverage -- CBS on the 18th, the rest on the 19th. NBC's Today read two briefs on Huang's suspension. That same day, the Democrats returned a $20,000 contribution from convicted Miami cocaine smuggler Jorge Cabrera, admitting they do not systematically check the background of donors None of the networks reported the story that night. ABC's Brian Ross did a full report on October 22, noting that while Cabrera was convicted of possessing more than 5,000 pounds of cocaine in July, the DNC did not give the money back until Newsweek began asking about it. CNN and NBC followed on the 24th. CBS did not. In the morning, Cabrera drew only two brief mentions on NBC's Today. 
<li><i>October 23:</i>  Expanding on Brian Ross, the Los Angeles Times reported that Yogesh Gandhi, the $325,000 donor to the DNC, claimed pauper status in not paying the $20 filing fee for his divorce. Network coverage? None. Federal judge Royce Lamberth issued an order for the DNC to produce Huang. Only NBC Nightly News reported the subpoena. October 24: Lamberth issued another order demanding the DNC produce Huang. Only ABC's World News Tonight reported on the story. After Brian Ross focused on the effort to locate Huang, Asia-based reporter Mark Litke reported on the Clintons' ties to the Riady family, the Indonesians who run the Lippo Group. The morning shows were absent. 
<li><i>October 25:</i> A panel of federal judges asked independent counsel Kenneth Starr to investigate whether former White House  counsel Bernard Nussbaum lied about Hillary Clinton's role in the hiring of Craig Livingstone. Two days later, NBC's Tim Russert insisted on the Sunday Today: "This is dead serious....I don't know how we can dismiss it nine days before an election." But only CNN's Bob Franken filed a full report. ABC and NBC had their anchors read briefs. CBS aired nothing. Other than one anchor brief on Saturday's Today, the morning shows reported nothing. 
<li><i>October 29:</i> The Washington Post published a front-page story reporting the DNC would not file a pre-election contributions report with the Federal Elections Commission, and John Huang surfaced after 11 days in hiding to testify. All four networks arrived on the story that evening. (While ABC's and NBC's morning shows reported the DNC's failure to file in anchor briefs, CBS This Morning aired nothing until the next day.) 
<li><i>October 30:</i> The Los Angeles Times reported that Mark Middleton, "a little-known, 34-year-old ex-White House aide from Arkansas," arranged a meeting between President Clinton and the chief financial manager of Taiwan's ruling party. The Times reported that the official, Liu Tai-Ying, offered to donate (illegally) $15 million to the Clinton campaign. Only CNN and NBC reported the story that night. ABC didn't even report a full campaign story. CBS followed the next day. NBC's Today, with a full report by Andrea Mitchell, was the only morning show on the story. 
<li><i>October 31:</i> "DNC Fundraiser Huang Visited White House Often," reported the front page of The Washington Post, 78 times since July 1995. ABC and CBS reported the story, but NBC did not. ABC's Good Morning America covered the story, but CBS This Morning and NBC's Today did not. ABC's Charles Gibson suggested "if Republicans had done this, the press would be killing them."
<li><i>November 3:</i> The Associated Press reported former Clinton CIA Director R. James Woolsey criticized Democrats for inviting foreign businessman Grigori Loutchansky to a 1994 DNC dinner, where he was photographed with the President. Clinton's own CIA Director, John Deutch, had testified that Loutchansky's company, Nordex, is "associated with Russian criminal activity." Network coverage: None. 
<li><i>November 4:</i> The Detroit Free Press reported on an October 21 Detroit fundraiser that netted $800,000 from  Iraqi Christians who lobbied the President to lift the embargo against Iraq. CBS and NBC threw in brief evening news mentions. ABC and CNN did not. The morning shows were silent.

<title>Janet Cooke Award -- November 1996 Media Watch</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3>Janet Cooke Award from the November 1996 Media Watch</h3>
<p>
<center><h2>Frontline Devotes An Hour to the Press, But Ignores Conservatives -- and Liberal Bias</h2></center>
<p>
<center><h2>Money is the Root of All Media Evils</h2></center>
<p>
<dd>Earlier this year, journalists bashing journalists became a fad. Atlantic Monthly editor
James Fallows' new book Breaking the News: How the Media Undermine Democracy led a new,
liberal attack on the media: too stardom-obsessed, too enamored of power, too wealthy from
lecture fees, too distant from the common people -- even too conservative on economics. On
October 22, Frontline aired a documentary titled "Why Americans Hate the Press," a
co-production with the far-left Center for Investigative Reporting. Correspondent and
producer Stephen Talbot never really attempted to answer how people feel about the press in
the hour-long program. Instead, he centered his program around Fallows arguing for the
"sedate high church" of journalism, as opposed to the reporters who've lost touch while
cashing in on Sunday morning "food fight" fame. 
<P>
 <dd>This thesis originated from Fallows -- and Bill Clinton. As Bob Woodward explained on
 Frontline: "Clinton makes that point in my book, that he believes that the Washington press
 corps is so out of touch that it is absolutely inconceivable that reporters will understand
 the issues that people are really dealing with in their lives, and Clinton feels a profound
 alienation from the Washington culture here, and I happen to agree with him." 
<P>
<dd>For probing the press from the left without balancing the show with press criticism from the
right, Frontline earned the Janet Cooke Award. Among the questions raised by a viewing of
the program: 
<ol>
<li><i>Where were the conservatives?</i> One thing that makes many Americans, and tens of millions of conservatives, hate the press is its liberal bias, but it went absolutely unmentioned. Questions about bias surfaced in Talbot's interviews with several of the talking heads (presented in full on the PBS website), but they never made the show. With the exception of Fred Barnes (who didn't comment on bias), not a single conservative appeared. Instead, PBS presented a left-wing stable of media scolds. First and foremost came Fallows, echoed by Washington Post reporter/columnist David Broder and media reporter Howard Kurtz, and even far-left critics Christopher Hitchens and Mark Hertsgaard, whose book On Bended Knee: The Press and the Reagan Presidency argued the press was incredibly soft on Ronald Reagan. Curiously, instead of investigating the press in its daily work on print and television, Talbot began the show with Fallows attacking The McLaughlin Group, a PBS program, and its commercial imitators, even interspersing them with footage of professional wrestling. Said Fallows: "That is something I would like to see done away with." Broder argued: "What bothers me is the notion that journalists believe, or some journalists believe, that they can have their cake and eat it, too, that you can have all of the special privileges, access, and extraordinary freedom that you have because you are a journalist in a society that protects journalism to a greater degree than any other country in the world, and at the same time, you can be a policy advocate, you can be a public performer on the lecture circuit or on television. I think that's greedy." Kurtz added: "It's certainly true that the more journalists have  become part of the affluent upper middle class, they have started to identify more with the elite in our society rather than the people who plunk down their quarters at the news stands for newspapers. I think that's a real problem." 
<li><i>Where was the evidence?</i> Talbot decried the influences on reporters who make large sums in speaking fees from corporations, but never provided a single example of content altered by them. As Fred Barnes suggested, "I haven't ever had anybody point out to me where that's happened." PBS didn't either. Fallows complained that corporations and trade associations expect a "subtle immunization," that before "doing you in," a reporter will say: "Oh, gee, I know old Joe from the tobacco lobby, maybe I should call him, see what he has to say." But isn't it the job of any decent reporter to include the business side of a dispute? 
<li><i>What about nonprofit groups?</i> Talbot touted ABC's July 1994 decision to ban reporter speaking conflicts:  "To avoid these potential and embarrassing conflicts of interest, ABC imposed a new policy banning speeches to lobbying groups by its reporters." But the rule doesn't apply to nonprofit advocacy groups. For example, in May 1994, ABC's Carole Simpson hosted a fundraiser for the liberal NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Why is it a conflict of interest to speak to the tobacco lobby but not to raise money for liberal lobbies like the NAACP? ABC told us its policy covered "groups with a political purpose," which they felt didn't include the NAACP. PBS didn't bring this up. 
<li><i>What does the revolving door prove?</i> Talbot decried the revolving door between journalism and politics, focusing on famous revolvers like Tim Russert and David Gergen. But he failed to mention what the revolving  door proves. For years, MediaWatch has documented how almost four times as many liberals and Democrats have revolved into the media as have conservatives or Republicans, which should have raised a question about whether liberal bias results. 
<li><i>Isn't this hypocrisy?</i> Except for Woodward, who Talbot interviewed and then counted on Hertsgaard to bash as an insider, Talbot never challenged his stable of liberal critics. Fallows insisted he despises buckraking revolving-door journalism, but keeps David Gergen at U.S. News. Broder deplored reporters as "policy advocates," but for many years has been a reporter and a columnist. Kurtz proclaimed reporters sympathize with politicians rather than the public, yet Kurtz has regularly complained about Bill Clinton's supposed maltreatment at the hands of reporters, talk show hosts, and comedians. When MediaWatch called the Center for Investigative Reporting in San Francisco for comment, Talbot was in Italy. CIR executive Sharon Tiller, listed as a producer on the Frontline program, did not return phone calls. Perhaps the most interesting sub-theme of the show is how a PBS program could point out media buckrakers like Cokie Roberts (of NPR), Steve Roberts (a PBS Washington Week in Review regular), and David Gergen (of The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer), but didn't suggest that PBS is a breeding ground for buckraking -- that the network spawned out of a contempt for commercialism is now awash in profiteering opportunities for those who are chosen to grace its airwaves. The worse hypocrisy of all belongs to Frontline itself. It deplored reporters being too close to power, but after years of leveling discredited allegations at the Reagan and Bush administrations, it hasn't done a single investigative program on the Clintons in four years.

<title>NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING: LOOK WHO'S TALKING</title>
</head>

<Body color="#FFFFFF">

<h2>NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING: LOOK WHO'S TALKING</h2>
<h3>By L. Brent Bozell III</h3>
</center>
<p>
<dd>The pundits are right. This is the worst year of negative campaigning I've ever seen. These Republican candidates are being torn apart at the seams. Just sample some of the invective that's being thrown at them on television:
<ol>
<li>Before the campaign really got going, Phil Gramm's campaign was being smeared with a negative TV ad featuring on the screen a New Republic headline labeling Gramm "The Porn Broker" for 18 seconds. When the New Republic's source for the allegation that Gramm had funded a "soft-porn" film in the 1970s repudiated the story, saying "there was no pornography at all," there were no apologies.
<li>Steve Forbes saw his flat tax plan attacked in one campaign commercial as likely to produce "hideous deficits." The ad concluded: "The fact remains the flat tax is a giant, untested theory. One economist suggested before we put it in, we should test it out someplace -- like Albania." 
<li>The most vicious negative attacks have been aired against Pat Buchanan. One underlined his endorsement by Russian nationalist kook Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Another one charged: "It's not that Pat Buchanan today is associated with overtly anti-Semitic or racist acts or statements, but rather that he has  created an image of someone who might be sympathetic to such acts or statements by others." Yet another stooped to attacks on his family, charging his father listened to the anti-Semitic radio show of Father Coughlin, and that his little brothers beat up Jewish kids -- "Christ-killers," they were allegedly called -- in the 1950s.
</ol>
<dd>Yet another ad against Buchanan showed racist nut David Duke at a Buchanan rally, and featured an endorsement from Ku Klux Klansman Daniel Carver. The ad concluded: "A man who says what he means and means what he says and now must fight the embrace of people who think they know exactly what he's talking about."
<p>
<dd>As you may already have concluded, these aren't really commercials made by the Republican presidential candidates. Anyone who watches politics knows that were candidates to say these things in their commercials they would be universally scorned -- especially by the press -- for doing so. They are, instead, what the networks themselves have offered us in this campaign. ABC smeared Phil Gramm. CBS bombed the Forbes flat tax. ABC's Ted Koppel and CBS's Bob McNamara hurled bigoted attacks at Buchanan. If we would hound candidates off the hustings for these kinds of attacks, why do we tolerate them from reporters?
<p>
<dd>These are the same networks who shake their heads and decry the corrosive negativity of politics. After the recent South Carolina debate, in which the candidates were required to respond to each other's negative ads, the networks all clucked at how unappetizing the prospect was. One wonders if they have considered how unappetizing watching their own programs can be. If they still wish to be the black pot lecturing the kettles on negative campaigning throughout this election year, I have four words for them: Sit down. Shut up. 
<p>
<dd>Koppel, for his part, couldn't even leave his attacks at the low level of questioning the ancient antics of the Buchanan children. (This, from the man who said of Bill Clinton's draft-dodging thank-you letter: "if we were electing that 23-year-old man, what he said and thought and felt at that time would be germane.") Koppel had help from Time essayist Lance Morrow, who in his magazine likened Buchanan to Joe McCarthy -- "the driving, urgent undershadow of menace." For "Nightline," Morrow added that Buchanan's upbringing at the Blessed Sacrament Church and Gonzaga High School was marked by a "reflexive" anti-Semitism of the "they killed Christ" variety. But others who attended high school with Buchanan flatly deny this outrageous charge. You guessed it: "Nightline" ignored them. 
<p>
<dd>Liberal Boston Globe columnist Tom Oliphant has called the liberal media to account on these charges of bigotry against Buchanan, often employing guilt by association: "For liberals to be silent simply because this filth is being directed at a creature of the Right who happens to be on a political roll is intolerable." 
<p>
<dd>Already, the media are preparing this story line for the 1996 general election campaign. Bill Clinton, the Great Triangulator, is trying to give the country a better tomorrow, while the Republicans, devoid of vision, have nothing to offer but cheap negative attacks.  
<p>
<dd>It's important to declare that negativity has a place in any campaign in defining why one candidate deserves to be elected over his opponent. But let the candidates do that. Decency is also important. It's time the national media attempt to rise to the level of civility these Republican candidates have shown each other.

</center>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
Americans are unquestionably a religious people. Studies show that virtually
all of us believe in God or another higher spiritual force; a clear majority regularly
attend religious services.<p>
     
Both news and entertainment television insist they reflect reality, yet they continue 
to tell the public that religion is insignificant and, more likely than not, a negative 
influence in society. <P>

Such is the primary finding of the Media Research Center's third annual study on 
the major television  networks' treatment of religion, which covers all network news
and prime time entertainment programming.  Faith in a Box, the most comprehensive
analysis of television and religion ever done, consists of two separate studies, one
on the news, the other on entertainment television.<p> 
<hr>

<a name="Entertainment"</a>
<center><B>Entertainment Media:<p></center></b>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
<UL>
<LI>The number of portrayals of religion in prime time went up slightly, to 287 from 
253 in 1994. However,  given that there were almost 1,800 hours of original shows,
that means there was only fewer than one depiction for every six hours of programming
 -- a slightly better ratio than that of 1994. Most of the increase in portrayals is attributable
to the debut last year of two part-time networks, UPN and WB. CBS's treatments of religion
greatly increased, but this was offset by ABC's sharp drop off.<p>

<LI>In two categories -- depictions of the devout laity and of the clergy -- the situation
worsened markedly. In the laity category, positives plummeted from 44 percent in '94
to 11 percent in '95, while negatives shot  from 35 percent in '94 to 64 percent last year.
Only 20 percent of depictions of the clergy were positive in '95, an eight percent drop
from '94.<p>

<LI>On no network were even half the overall portrayals positive. CBS had the highest
percentage (47.5) of  positive depictions among the major networks. ABC (36.7) and
NBC (34.4) were well in back of CBS, while Fox (24.4) badly trailed all other networks.<p>
</ul>
<hr>

<a name="News"</a>
<center><b>News Media:</b></center><p>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
<UL>
<LI>Total network news coverage of religion in 1995 remained numerically insignificant:
out of more than 18,000 evening news stories in 1995, religion drew only 249; out of
more than 26,000 morning news segments, religion drew only 224. For three years in
a row, the news networks have had trouble cracking a one-percent barrier when it 
comes to religion coverage.<p>

           
<LI>The Catholic Church dominated religion news coverage, attracting almost 50 percent
of the evening stories and 71 percent of the morning segments. CBS aired the most 
obviously negative stories on the Catholic Church, including a 60 Minutes profile with
25 &quot;dissidents&quot; and no defenders, and a story calling Ireland a &quot;
church-dominated backwater.&quot;<p>

<LI>While the total number of stories about violence and harassment at abortion clinics
declined from 245 stories in 1994 to 142, only three stories focused on the documented
violence of abortionor harassment by abortion advocates.<p>

<LI>The religious right was again portrayed as extreme and damaging to the Republican Party,
even though not a single pro-life incumbent lost in the 1994 elections.  <p>
</ul>
In the first two studies, the MRC suggested a number of ways the networks could improve
their coverageof religion. With a few notable exceptions, none has been enacted. Given the
public's increasing dissatisfaction with and distrust of the media, it is instructive to repeat
these recommendations and urge network decision makers to change their course.<p> 

Network entertainment divisions should cease their hostility to persons of faith and 
respect religious values. Furthermore, they should attempt to match CBS's success 
with Touched By an Angel by airing other pro-faith series of their own. Also, they 
ought to recognize that the audience for such religion-friendly programming is not
only large, but affluent (i.e., it's an attractive demographic for advertisers).<p>

The news study recommends that the networks decisively break the one-percent
ghetto of coverage that religion receives every year. To make that recommendation
reality, the networks need to make a serious commitment to hire a religion correspondent.
With the exception of ABC, the networks have failed to go beyond general assignment 
reporters. The news study also recommends that network reporters try harder to present
religious issues and authorities in a fair-minded and objective manner, especially on social
issues. <p>

<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3> 
  <p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
The Media Research Center's initial &quot;Faith in a Box&quot; study
explored how entertainment television handled religion in 1993.
The report showed that on the rare occasions when sitcoms,
dramas, miniseries, and made-for-TV movies treated spiritual
topics, it was most often in a hostile manner; there were even
some cases of bluntly anti-religious bigotry. <p>

The mixed results documented in our second study, which dealt
with 1994 programming, suggested that a rethinking and
reawakening might have been taking place in Hollywood. Whereas in
1993 negative depictions had outnumbered positive ones by a
3-to-2 ratio, in '94 there were almost twice as many positive as
negative portrayals. Furthermore, the total number of religious
incidences more than doubled: there were 253 in '94, versus only
116 in '93. <p>

The minuses: the laity and the clergy continued to be vilified in
dramas, ridiculed in comedies. Moreover, the frequency of
religious depictions -- roughly, one for every seven hours of
programming -- illuminated the fact that religion remained
largely a non-presence in prime time. <p>
 
This third annual study, covering 1995 programming, indicates in
one sense that the '94 results were not aberrant: overall, there
again were more positive than negative portrayals. However, in
two categories -- depictions of the devout laity and of the
clergy -- the picture worsened markedly. And, not only did the
total number of treatments increase only slightly, most of the
jump was attributable to the 1995 launch of two part-time
networks, UPN and WB.<p>

Television bigwigs like to claim their fare reflects reality.
This is clearly not the case with religion; given its prevalence
and popularity in our society, it is 1) seriously
underrepresented and 2) ill-served on prime time. The viewing
public is waiting for the networks to close, or at least narrow,
this gap. <p>

Our methodology: MRC analysts studied virtually all 1995 prime
time entertainment programs on the broadcast networks ABC, CBS,
Fox, NBC, UPN, and WB. Instances of religious content were
entered into a computerized data base and categorized under
either personal faith; religion in doctrinal and institutional
terms; the laity; the clergy; or miscellaneous. <p>

Within each category, the instances were classified as either
positive, mixed, neutral, or negative. &quot;Mixed&quot; indicates balanced
points of view with ultimately no side taken; the &quot;neutral&quot;
designation encompasses depictions that were ambiguous or offered
insufficiently substantial treatments of the issue. (In our
previous studies, mixed/neutral was one category.)<p>


The outstanding portrayals in each category are presented below
in order of their length, with the briefest instances discussed
first. Not all treatments or mentions of religion are touched on
in the text, but each is represented in the statistical
appendices, and each is noted by category, chronologically, in a
third appendix.<p> 
<hr>

<a name="Two"></a>
<h3>II. STUDY RESULTS</h3>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
<i>Overview?</i><p>

In 1995, there were 1,798 hours of original prime time
entertainment programming on the six broadcast networks. Those
webs aired 287 portrayals of religion; 38.3 percent of these were
positive, 27.9 negative, 7.3 mixed, and 26.5 neutral. <p>

Where raw numbers are concerned, CBS led with 99 depictions; NBC
broadcast 93, Fox 45, ABC 30. (UPN, with 12, and WB, with eight,
both of which went on the air early in 1995, each offered
programming only two nights per week that year.) NBC
and Fox held relatively steady from last year to this, but CBS's
number represented an large increase over 1994's total of 63,
while ABC plummeted from its 1994 figure of 67.  <p>

CBS had the highest percentage of positive depictions, at 47.5;
ABC (36.7 percent) and NBC (34.4) followed, and Fox, with 24.4,
brought up the rear among the major networks. Fox led in negative
portrayals at 46.7 percent; ABC (36.7), NBC (26.9), and CBS
(20.2) trailed. <p>

In religious terms, Touched By an Angel, the CBS drama currently
in its second season, was the outstanding series of 1995, and
perhaps the most pro-faith series in television history. (After a
shaky start, it is also a bona fide popular success.) No series
was anywhere near as anti-religious, although Fox's The Simpsons
consistently got in its licks. Probably the greatest
disappointment of the year was NBC's Amazing Grace, whose
minister protagonist espoused a faith so diluted as to be almost
unrecognizable.<p>
<pre>
   <h3>A. Faith: Prime Time's Expressions of Belief<p></h3>

  As in 1993 and '94, religion was treated far more favorably in
  this category than in any other. It comprises instances wherein a
  person states or manifests in simple terms his or her belief, or
  lack thereof.

  Positive -- 76.6 percent (74% in 1994; 63% in 1993)<p>

  On prime time, the most common indication of faith is prayer. In
  the March 13 NBC movie Awake to Danger, a father whose daughter
  is in a coma offers to help; the doctor tells him to pray. On the
  February 21 Grace Under Fire (ABC), a man remarks that he &quot;prayed
  that the Lord would give me one more chance to make [his
  seriously ill father] proud of me.&quot;<p>


  A character on the September 25 Chicago Hope (CBS) says, &quot;I
  hadn't been to church in years. That is, not until recently, when
  my daughter had heart trouble and I found myself praying.&quot;
  Another medical drama, NBC's ER, featured on its December
  14 episode an elderly Holocaust survivor whose kidnapped
  granddaughter had just been found alive. The old woman comments
  that while the little girl was missing, &quot;I did something that I
  stopped doing fifty years ago: I prayed.&quot;<p>
   
  On the September 30 Sisters (NBC), Teddy, who is coming out of a
  coma, takes part in a fantastical exchange with her younger self.
  After the young Teddy says, &quot;All it takes is a little
  persistence,&quot; the adult Teddy adds, &quot;;And a whole lot of faith.&quot;
  The camera then pans upward to the sky. <P>
   
  One of the celestial emissaries on CBS's Touched By an Angel had
  her own crisis of faith in the February 25 episode. Monica,
  addressing God, wonders, &quot;Why have You forsaken me? Why are You
  punishing me?&quot; Monica's mentor, Tess, responds, &quot;Has God ever
  forsaken you, Monica? He told you he wouldn't, and He never has.&quot;<p>
   
  Fox's The X-Files surprised many with an affirmation of
  Catholicism in its December 15 installment. Scully, an FBI agent,
  regains her faith while investigating a series of murders in
  which each victim has what appears to be stigmata. After the case
  is solved, Scully goes to confession and discusses her drift from
  the Church in the past few years; the priest tells her,
  &quot;Sometimes you have to go full circle.&quot; Scully has the
  show's last line: &quot;God is speaking, but no one's listening.&quot;<p>

  The January 10 episode of NBC's The John Larroquette Show
  centered on what many perceived as an image of Jesus Christ on a
  bus-station wall. Even though it transpires that the face is
  really that of Willie Nelson from an old, painted-over poster,
  the image inspires a good deal of pro-faith reflection. The bus
  station manager, addressing God, states, &quot;I have spent most of my
  life unconvinced of Your existence, [but] I have come to believe
  in a higher power.&quot;<p>


  Negative -- 6.4 percent (6% in 1994; 22% in 1993)<p>

  On the May 9 NYPD Blue (ABC), Detective Sipowicz explains to his
  fiancee that he lost his faith as a result of the depravity he's
  witnessed on the job, and on the December 1 Homicide: Life on the
  Street (NBC), a Baltimore detective, offered the chance to see
  the Pope in person during the pontiff's visit to that city,
  comments, &quot;Sixty thousand people...looking at a man for some sort
  of miracle? No, thank you. I'm not interested.&quot;<p>

  Mixed --  8.5 percent; Neutral -- 8.5 percent; (Mixed/neutral 20%
  in 1994; 15% in 1993)<p>

  One mixed incidence was found on the February 26 Earth 2 (NBC).
  After Yale prays, Mary, a resident of the Tarian planet, asks,
  &quot;Who were you talking to?&quot; Yale responds, &quot;God...[to] ask
  forgiveness for the harm that [one does].&quot; Mary counters,
  &quot;The Tarian way is better: Don't harm.&quot; A neutral example:
  apropos of a murder, a policeman on the March 19 NBC movie Ed
  McBain's 87th Precinct asks, &quot;If there's a God in heaven, why do
  things like this have to happen?&quot; His partner answers, &quot;I don't
  know.&quot;<p> 


   <h3>B. The Institution: Prime Time's Treatment of Churches and Their
     Doctrines</h3>

  This category deals with religion handled in institutional terms,
  such as a reference to a service or to a particular church or its
  doctrines.

  Positive -- 31.1 percent (46% in 1994; 50% in 1993)
  On the January 17 Something Wilder (NBC), a boy, age five or so,
  asks his father where one goes after death. His father replies,
  &quot;Heaven.&quot; A character on the November 26 episode of Fox's Space:
  Above and Beyond comments, "When I'm on a battlefield, and I see
  a human dead...I can feel something is missing...You can feel
  they have no souls." 
 
  During the December 12 CBS movie A Holiday to Remember, a woman
  tells a young runaway, "Come on, I don't want to be visiting you
  down at the jail in five years. You need religion." On the
  December 18 Can't Hurry Love (CBS), Annie tries to organize her
  co-workers to volunteer with religious charities, performing such
  tasks as collecting Christmas gifts for needy children.<p>
 
  Negative -- 31.1 percent (22% in 1994; 50% in 1993)<p>

  The title character of CBS's Murphy Brown is hosting a memorial
  service in the January 16 installment; asked if she's put a Bible
  out for the mourners, Murphy answers, &quot;Eeeuuuwww, I don't think I
  have one.&quot; On the November 2 episode of Fox's The Crew, a woman
  says to a gay character, &quot;I don't care what they say about you in
  Leviticus. I think you are fun.&quot;<p>
   
  In the March 8 premiere of CBS's The George Wendt Show, two
  characters return to their old church for casino night; one says
  the visit brings back memories of "the gradual stripping away of
  a young boy's self-esteem.&quot; On the November 21 episode of ABC's
  Roseanne, the protagonist, playing an unpleasant pilgrim at the
  first Thanksgiving, dismisses an Indian's reference to "Mother
  Earth.&quot;<p>

  &quot;That's nothing but heathen talk,&quot; Roseanne remarks. "There is
  one God. He's in  heaven, sitting on [His] throne, so he can damn
  everything. The end.&quot;<p>
  
  
  Mixed -- 6.6 percent; Neutral -- 31.1 percent; (Mixed/neutral 32%
  in 1994; 0% in 1993)
   
  A mixed example comes from the May 9 Wings (NBC). After a
  character remarks that he's going to attend Mass regularly, a
  friend commends him: "Good for you...Without a strong spiritual
  connection, what does life really mean?" He asks what religion
  she is, to which she replies dismissively, "I don't know. Some
  sort of Protestant."
  
  In the neutral category, a character on the June 14 High Sierra
  Search and Rescue (NBC) who's been a recluse since her husband
  left her is rebuked by a friend: "You quit your job because you
  couldn't make it ten miles to work. Then five miles to church."
  On the March 14 John Larroquette Show, a regular character rigs
  it so John can see another player's poker hand. Afterwards, the
  character says, "What if God really does keep score of all the
  bad things you do? I'd hate to think I had only one sin left and
  wasted it riggin' a poker game when I could've robbed a bank or
  something."  


   <h3>C. The Laity: Prime Time's Portrayal of Believers</h3>

  This category encompasses depictions of those for whom religion
  is a strong (sometimes the central) force in their lives. It
  covers both portrayals of their explicitly religious words or
  deeds and their secular conduct. As opposed to simple
  declarations of faith, we see here and in the clergy category
  that the more elaborate the depiction, the more likely it is to
  be negative -- a finding common to all three studies.   


  Positive -- 11.1 percent (44% in 1994; 18% in 1993)
   
  In the March 20 NBC movie Menu For Murder, a mistress asserts her
  affair with a judge would not have lasted because the judge's
  wife is a devout Catholic. On the October 31 The Client (CBS), a
  woman tells a friend that the friend's taking in her grandchild
  was &quot;a Christian thing.&quot;<p>
  
  Negative -- 64.4 percent (35% in 1994; 68% in 1993)
   
  Murphy Brown's title character, addressing a women's studies
  class during the October 30 episode, asserts, "While we sit here
  arguing, the radical religious right is working to take away
  everything we've fought for." During the May 14 CBS movie
  The Rockford Files: A Blessing in Disguise, an actress appearing
  in an irreverent movie is called a "slut" and almost physically
  assaulted by followers of a televangelist.  
   
  Detectives on the February 24 Homicide: Life on the Street drop
  by the house of a middle-aged woman prominently displaying a
  crucifix on her front door. She admits she killed her boyfriend
  (for dating her sister) and put his body in the freezer. On the
  November 29 Law & Order, a mentally disturbed woman kills her
  baby daughter because she believes God wanted her to.
  
  Mixed -- 4.4 percent; Neutral -- 20.0 percent; (Mixed/neutral 21%
  in 1994; 14% in 1993)
   
  One of the mixed treatments was offered by the April 28 Picket
  Fences (CBS). After killing a swan, a repentant young boy becomes
  devoutly religious and develops what appear to be stigmata. His
  sister accepts what happens to him at face value, but the
  patriarch says any supernatural explanation is "crap" and
  "evidence of how dangerous and how ridiculous organized religion
  can be."
   
  Neutral examples: on the January 10 Frasier (NBC), an adult son
  says to his father, "Brush your teeth and say your prayers." The
  father responds, "That's what I used to say...didn't I?" His
  other son says, "No, you didn't," to which the father replies, "I
  meant to." Establishing his credentials as a good citizen, a
  murder suspect on the November 22 Law & Order (NBC) says, "I pay
  my taxes. I go to church." He turns out to be innocent. 
  

   <h3>D. The Clergy: Prime Time's Treatment of Religious Leaders</h3>
   
  This category comprises portrayals of the professionally
  religious.
  
  Positive -- 20.0 percent (28% in 1994; 15% in 1993)
   
  On the November 27 Nowhere Man (UPN), a mother gives her son news
  of his hometown: Father Kearney has died. "He was a wonderful
  man," she says. "Everyone in town will miss him dearly." In the
  February 5 CBS movie The Piano Lesson, a minister says, "I ain't
  got no power...God's got the power...God's got a wonderful
  power." A priest on the November 12 NBC movie Her Hidden Truth
  champions the cause of a woman unjustly convicted of murder.
  
  Negative -- 41.7 percent (31% in 1994; 59% in 1993)
   
  On the January 1 George Carlin Show (Fox), a waitress in a bar
  shows her breasts to a priest. He says he finds them attractive,
  whereupon she says to her boyfriend, "If an abnormal man like him
  likes them, they're good enough for you." On the March 25
  Mommies (NBC), a woman laments, "I've turned into a boring person
  who makes rules and says no," to which her friend queries,
  "You're the Pope?" A married minister asks Ellen for a date on
  the November 5 Cleghorne! (WB).
   
  During the March 8 George Wendt Show, a man reminisces about a
  nun lifting him by his eyebrows and about "all the hell [priests
  and nuns] put me through as a kid." In the April 17 NBC movie The
  Other Mother, a teen mother lives at a Catholic halfway house;
  the nuns who run the home are portrayed not just as well-meaning
  disciplinarians, but as excessively harsh. 
 

  Mixed -- 5.0 percent, Neutral -- 33.3 percent (Mixed/neutral 41%
  in 1994; 26% in 1993)<p>
 
  The December 8 Picket Fences provided the outstanding mixed
  instance. The episode centered on a visit by Pope John Paul II to
  a small Wisconsin town, where he witnesses a murder. The attorney
  for the accused killer declares that because the victim was gay,
  the Pope can't be an unbiased witness given the Vatican's
  condemnation of homosexual acts. Others, including the judge in
  the case, are more respectful of the pontiff.<p>
   
  Among the neutrals: On the October 1 Hope & Gloria (NBC),
  regarding a nun named Theodore Rose, a man wonders, &quot;Why do nuns
  always have names that make them sound like they're half man,
  half woman?&quot; His ex-wife answers, &quot;What difference does it make?
  They don't use either half.&quot; On the October 8 Can't Hurry Love, a
  woman says, &quot;I'm sure even Mother Teresa has things she doesn't
  like about guys. OK, so maybe her dating years are behind her,
  but you get my point.&quot; <p>
  

   <h3>E. Miscellaneous</h3>

  In other words, everything that didn't fit into the other
  categories. Many references to God go here if they don't belong
  under Faith, inasmuch as He is not, strictly speaking, clergy.<p>
   
  As usual, almost all incidences were mixed or neutral. On the
  September 17 Cybill (CBS), a woman who's just been on a shopping
  spree says, &quot;I, for one, feel closer to God.&quot; One of the positive
  examples was heard on the May 5 Homicide: Life on the Street.
  When a detective was told he was lucky not to have been shot, he
  replies, &quot;Luck had nothing to do with it. God reached down and
  graced [the potential killer] with wisdom.&quot;

<h3>III. RECOMMENDATIONS</center></h3> <br>
  <p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p> 
In last year's study, we noted a marginal improvement in prime
time's treatment of religion from 1993 to `94, yet in
quantitative terms the numbers were still anemic and in
qualitative terms the attacks on religion continued.<P>
  
Regarding 1995, the overall numbers were similar to those of `94.
There was, however, significant qualitative regression in certain
categories. <p>
   
Perhaps this was, in part, liberal Hollywood's reaction to the
widely acknowledged boost that evangelical voters gave
conservative Republican candidates in the fall '94 elections.
Perhaps old habits don't change easily.<p> 
   
Whatever the motivation, the step backward is cause for concern.
The silver lining, though, is that the failure of the broadcast
networks' yuppie-centered fall offerings and the continued
decline in their share of the audience makes a return to
traditional programming a more attractive prospect now. Our
recommendations:<p>
     
Re-establish respect for religious values on the networks.
Religion should not be treated as if it were a political issue,
where a balance of positive and negative is considered
appropriate. Rather, faith in general, and the faithful in
particular, should be afforded the dignity it and they deserve.
It is highly unlikely that any major network will ever air vast
amounts of faith-oriented programming, nor do we suggest such a
thing should be done. The networks can, however, make it clear to
religious viewers that at the very least, their shows will not
assault Judeo-Christian values. <p>

Clone a religious hit. After the young-adult-oriented Friends
became a smash in the 1994-'95 season, the fall '95 prime time
schedule was thick with series in that genre. With the success of
Touched By an Angel, the networks now have a pro-faith winner to
copy. Wouldn't it be nice to see more shows that dared to speak
of the power of God's love? At the recent Academy Awards, actor
Christopher Reeve challenged the film industry to &quot;put social
issues ahead of box-office success...[to] continue to take risks.
Let's tackle the issues. In many ways, our film community can do
it better than anyone else.&quot; The same challenge applies to
television and matters of faith.<p> 
   
Listen to the concerns of the faithful. Networks invest vast sums
in market research, yet seemingly don't take into account the
millions who, save for series like Touched By an Angel and
Christy, are offended by the values of television and are tuning
out. The more shows of that kind there are, the more that
audience will watch. And make no mistake about it: studies show
this audience is large and affluent. Executives like ABC's Ted
Harbert know that the industry's frantic pursuit of the 18-to-49
demographic was excessive; they should now turn their attention
to the audience that cherish traditional values. In this way,
networks can boost both their Nielsen ratings and their profits.<p>
   
Television is on the hot seat, and the only way to get off it is
to behave responsibly. Ultimately, this means not content
ratings, or encoding for the V-chip, but rather changing the
values promoted over the airwaves. An increase in
religion-friendly programming can and should be at the center of
such a prime time reformation.<p>

<h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2> 
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>  
The media continue to miss the story of a religious and moral
resurgence across the country in our politics, in our culture,
and most importantly, in our churches. In their survey The
Churching of America, Roger Finke and Rodney Stark reported that
virtually all Americans believe in God or a universal spirit. A
substantial majority believe they will be called before God on
Judgment Day to account for their sins. The vast majority of
Americans believe the Bible is either the literal or inspired
Word of God, and the Ten Commandments are valid rules for living.
Sixty percent of the populace can be found attending houses of
worship in a given month. This &quot;silent majority&quot; still worships
and reflects on their faith under the radar screen of a
secularized media elite.<p>

Despite officially proclaimed concern in the highest councils of
the national news media that religion and religious issues too
often go ignored, the record demonstrates that the concern has
been matched by little noticeable action. The Media Research
Center's first study of television news coverage of religion and
religious values in 1993 discovered both a surprising paucity of
religion coverage and an overt pattern of advocacy against
traditional values: out of more than 18,000 evening news stories,
only 212 evening news stories dealt with religion. Out of more
than 26,000 morning segments, only 197 dealt directly with
religion. Prime-time magazine programs and Sunday morning
interview shows broached religious subjects on only 18 occasions.
The networks had trouble cracking the one percent barrier with
religion coverage. <p>

Employing the same methodology, the Media Research Center
discovered that religious coverage actually declined in 1994.
Evening news stories rose slightly to 225, but morning segments
declined to 151, and Sunday talk show and magazine show segments
dropped to nine. Thanks in part to events like the papal visit to
the United States in October, 1995's network output on religious
news and issues added up to a slight increase over 1994. The
number of evening news stories rose to 249; morning segments grew
noticeably to 224; and magazine and interview show segments
increased to 15. Despite the slight increase overall, the
networks are still barely cracking the one percent barrier. The
pattern in unchanging: the networks continue to neglect people
and issues of faith in their everyday reporting. When religion is
covered, hostility toward traditional religious positions on
social issues remains overt and sometimes unrebutted.  <p>

<h2>II. QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF NETWORK NEWS COVERAGE </h2>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
<pre>
  <h3>A. Evening News Stories</h3>

  Out of an estimated 18,000 segments last year on the five network
  programs evaluated (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News,
  CNN's World News, NBC Nightly News, and The MacNeil-Lehrer
  NewsHour on PBS) the networks devoted only 249 stories to
  religion or religious issues in 1995, a slight increase (11
  percent) from 1994.<p>

  Only 143 of these were reporter-based stories (compared to 106
  anchor briefs), an increase of nine stories from the previous
  year's full story total. <p>

  As in past years, news stories perhaps tangentially related to
  religious issues (in this year's case, the Million Man March led
  by Rev. Louis Farrakhan) were only included if they involved
  issues of religion or theology.<p>

  CNN's World News tied with ABC for the highest number of religion
  stories with 65, even though ABC's World News Tonight lasts only
  half as long. The quantity of news coverage is also determined by
  the length of each story: only 23 (35 percent) of ABC's stories
  were anchor briefs, compared to 47 segments (or 72 percent) of
  CNN coverage. CNN's total was three stories less than 1994, while
  ABC reported 15 stories more than the year before. <p>

  CBS improved to 50 stories, up from 31 stories in 1993 and 46 in
  1994. NBC trailed with 43, the same number as 1994 and 11 less
  than 1993. For the third straight year, The MacNeil-Lehrer
  NewsHour lagged far behind the others with 26 stories, eight more
  than 1994.<p>

  But only 11 were reporter-based stories or interview segments.   
  The Catholic Church again led the coverage with 111 stories, up
  from 103 in 1994. Fully 68 percent of the total (76 stories) were
  anchor briefs, not full-length, reporter-based stories. Generic
  religion stories (without specific reference to denominations),
  often on subjects like school prayer or church-state relations,
  came in second with 70 stories. Once again, news of individual
  Protestant denominations was nearly absent -- five for the
  Southern Baptists, four on Episcopalians, two on Anglicans.
  Muslims drew nine stories; Jews six; Mormons six; Buddhists five;
  Hindus, Greek Orthodox, and Russian Orthodox, one each. Unlike
  1994, when it outnumbered all stories on individual Protestant
  denominations combined, New Age spirituality attracted only one
  evening news story in 1995.<p>
 

  <h3>B. Morning Shows<p></h3>

  Despite a full two hours daily for news and interviews, adding up
  to more than 26,000 segments in 1995, the major network morning
  shows (ABC's Good Morning America, CBS This Morning, and NBC's
  Today) devoted 224 morning show stories to religion in 1994.
  That's not very impressive in terms of the tens of thousands of
  morning segments, but it is a noticeable one-third increase over
  1994, if not a significant increase from the 197 morning news
  stories in 1993.<p>

  Like 1994, the networks were closely matched in their amount of
  coverage. NBC led again with 80 segments, up from 52 in 1994; CBS
  aired 74, up from 48 in 1994; and ABC aired 70, up from 50
  segments in the previous year. Of the 224 stories, more than half (115
  stories) were anchor briefs.<p>

  Greater emphasis on religion interview segments may be partially
  responsible for the increase. NBC interviewed &quot; dissident
  Catholic&quot;  priest and author Andrew Greeley on five occasions. CBS
  devoted an hour of This Morning to a rabbi, a priest, and a
  Protestant pastor. ABC began airing the "God Squad" duo of Father
  Thomas Hartman and Rabbi Marc Gellman in mid-year, relying on
  them for 12 of their 23 interviews in 1995. Gellman's appearances
  substantially heightened the visibility of Jewish voices on the
  networks from past years. Counting Father Hartman's appearances,
  159 stories (71 percent) of the morning coverage featured the
  Catholic Church, a great increase from 63 stories in 1994, a year
  which lacked a papal visit.  <p>


  <h3>C. Magazine/Interview Shows</h3>

  The blind spot to religious news remains especially noticeable on
  Sunday morning interview shows and prime-time magazine programs.
  Analysts reviewed the Sunday shows (ABC's This Week with David
  Brinkley, CBS's Face the Nation, NBC's Meet the Press) as well as
  the prime-time magazine lineup (ABC's Day One, Prime Time Live,
  and 20/20; CBS's Eye to Eye with Connie Chung, 48 Hours, and 60
  Minutes; and NBC's three-night Dateline format). Out of roughly
  400 shows, the number of religion stories rose from nine in 1994
  to 15 in 1995, including segment repeats. But that also includes
  three one-hour programs on religion: a March 15 Peter Jennings
  Reporting special, a September 8 CBS Reports on the religious
  right, and an October 5 48 Hours focusing on the papal visit. Out
  of roughly 150 shows between the three networks, only one Sunday
  morning interview focused on religion: a May 21 segment of Meet
  the Press with Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition and Clinton
  aide George Stephanopoulos. <p>

<h2>III. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF RELIGION COVERAGE AND SOCIAL ISSUES</h2>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
<pre>
 <h3> A. Institutions</h3>

  Institutional coverage of religion again focused mainly on the
  Catholic Church, and reporters focused on the unpopularity of
  Church teachings among the American laity: 15 stories highlighted
  poll results finding a majority of American Catholics rejecting
  Church stands. These polls continued to ignore the statistical
  significance on the issues between Catholics who attend church
  weekly and lapsed Catholics who seldom or never attend Mass.
  The networks again portrayed the traditional Church as an
  oppressive, narrow-minded hierarchy with outdated moral concepts.
  Again, in stories and interviews, moral equivalence was awarded
  to self-proclaimed &quot; dissidents&quot;  with a pro-abortion, pro-gay,
  feminist agenda. A case study is the January 22, 1995 60 Minutes.
  Mike Wallace devoted an entire segment to Call to Action, a
  Chicago-based group of &quot; dissidents.&quot;  Wallace portrayed this group
  as a credible, moderate voice for respectable Catholics: &quot; Among
  the things they challenge is the Pope's position on birth
  control, on women becoming priests, and on priests being able to
  marry....There's no denying that for many American Catholics,
  those teachings have lost their appeal.&quot; <p>

  Wallace characterized his subjects as &quot; hardly wild-eyed radicals,
  these people from Call to Action. They're sober church workers,
  nuns and priests, and just plain concerned Catholics....their
  ideals formed in the heady age of change back in the '60s.&quot;  These
  people had decidedly un-sober things to say. Father Mike Flager
  denounced the Church as &quot; spiritually bankrupt&quot;  and said the
  traditional Church has &quot; a love it or leave it, you know, it's
  that crazy patriotism philosophy.&quot;  Edwina Gately &quot; was described
  as a devout Catholic with the tongue of a pagan tart.&quot;  Gately
  replied: &quot; Well I'm OK with the `pagan tart,' it's the `devout
  Catholic' that worries me.&quot;  Wallace reminded her she once said
  &quot; the Vatican is the only tyranny left in the world today.&quot;  <p>

  Wallace's report included 25 soundbites from &quot; dissidents&quot;  without
  broadcasting a single voice in favor of traditional Catholicism.
  Wallace later conceded to the Catholic newspaper Our Sunday
  Visitor that &quot; interviews with Harvard law professor Mary Ann
  Glendon and George Weigel of the Ethics and Public Policy Center,
  prominent lay Catholics who support Church teaching, were not
  used because producers felt the material was too dissimilar to
  work with footage from the Call to Action conference.&quot;  
  When Pope John Paul visited America in October, he underlined the
  Church's historical call to assist the poor, but network analysts
  gave it a secular spin, portraying the remarks as an attack on
  the Republican Party. PBS anchor Robert MacNeil wondered: &quot; Is the
  Pope against the Contract with America?&quot;  CNN anchor Judy Woodruff
  asked Pat Buchanan about the pontiff: &quot; He's certainly been a
  conservative on many theological issues, but many people would
  agree he's been more liberal on social issues, helping the poor,
  he's talked a lot about this. How do you as a Catholic reconcile
  that with what your own party has done this year and is talking
  of doing with regard to cutting back programs for the poor in
  this country?&quot; <p>

  For three morning interviews, NBC brought on Father Andrew
  Greeley to echo that liberal spin: &quot; I heard a Catholic
  conservative last night say that the Pope's words have nothing to
  do with American politics. And I can't imagine anybody being more
  totally wrong. The Pope has come to the United States when it's
  in a very mean-spirited period when it's bashing immigrants,
  bashing poor people, bashing minorities. And the Pope has come to
  say `Hey, stop that!' He isn't talking about specific legislative
  measures, but he's certainly addressing himself to the spirit
  that elected and sustains the Gingrich-Dole Congress.&quot; 
  But later in the same interview, Greeley suggested Catholics can
  ignore the Pope on sexual matters because Greeley thinks he's
  wrong: &quot; Well, most Catholics choose to be Catholic on their own
  terms....they reserve the right to follow their own consciences
  and appeal to a God who does understand.&quot; <p>

  When Ireland moved to lift its ban on divorce, CBS Evening News
  reporter Cinny Kennard applauded on November 18: &quot; Those opposed
  are backed by the mighty Roman Catholic Church that argues
  divorce would profoundly damage the stability and fabric of Irish
  society...Fear is the primary weapon for those who want to
  maintain the ban.&quot;  Kennard highlighted what she felt were more
  enlightened opinions: &quot; For many here, it's more then a referendum
  on the right to remarry. It's another example of the country's
  move to re-invent itself as a more modern and progressive
  Ireland, an Ireland that is more tolerant and open. Recently,
  there has been legal reform on contraception, abortion, and
  homosexuality; signs that the traditional Church grip on Ireland
  has been loosened; signs that the country is increasingly run
  from government buildings and not the Vatican.&quot; <p> 

  Kennard repeated her line on the November 30 CBS This Morning:
  &quot; It's been like an awakening. Ireland, long positioned on the
  world's stage as a church-dominated backwater, has reinvented
  itself as a new and energized Emerald Isle. A more open, a more
  tolerant place.&quot; <p>

  <h3>B. Abortion and Violence (142 in 1995; 247 in 1994; 150  in 1993)<p></h3>

  Social issues bring out the bias in reporters. In a March 2, 1996
  appearance on the CNBC program Cal Thomas, Washington Post
  reporter Howard Kurtz denied that reporters had a liberal
  political bias in favor of the Democrats, but he did suggest &quot; I
  think there is, however, a problem with what I call cultural bias
  on these subjects that you mentioned -- religion, abortion,
  homosexuality. I think a lot of it is unconscious, but I think on
  those kinds of subjects, most reporters are probably to the left
  of the American public and probably don't realize that they're
  not always giving a full weights of views of people who have very
  different take on these matters.<p>

  Reporters may pride themselves on adding context and perspective
  to the issues, but on abortion the networks continue a troubling
  pattern of black/white distinctions: pro-lifers are inextricably
  linked to a violent, radical fringe, while abortion advocates are
  harassed do-gooders operating in the peaceful mainstream. 
  Due to the lack of further violence against abortionists, evening
  newscasts devoted 59 segments to harassment and violence around
  abortion clinics, down almost 60 percent over the 146 segments
  broadcast in 1994. The network morning shows had 82 segments,
  down almost 14 percent from the 95 segments shown in 1994. Magazine
  shows aired only one segment on abortion-related violence in
  1995, down from the six they presented the previous year. Total
  coverage of violence around abortion clinics on all shows amounted to 142
  stories, compared to the 247 in 1994 and 150 segments in 1993. 
  Among the abortion stories not focusing on pro-life violence, the
  networks reported on the debates in Congress over partial birth
  abortions and abortion services at armed forces hospitals, as
  well as the Surgeon General nomination of Dr. Henry Foster, who had
  trouble remembering how many abortions he had performed. Evening
  shows aired 161 total abortion-related segments, morning shows
  245, and magazine shows 11, for a grand sum of 417 segments. On every
  network, pro-life violence stories garnered about one-third of
  the total coverage. That declined from 1994, when pro-life violence
  stories outnumbered other abortion stories by a 2 to 1 margin. 
  Unlike the past two years, religion was not indicted as a
  co-conspirator in pro-life violence. The media did not allude to
  a &quot; link between crime and religion,&quot;  as CBS Evening News anchor Bob
  Schieffer declared two days after Dr. David Gunn was murdered in
  1993. But, once again, the pro-life movement was demonized as a
  dangerous, menacing force.<p>
 
  On January 3, 1995 Jane Pauley promoted an upcoming segment on
  Dateline NBC by charging: "Still ahead -- the latest round of
  bloodshed and violence at abortion clinics. The anti-abortion
  movement has been creeping to the edge of bloody fanaticism for a
  decade. One hundred twenty-nine bombings across the country. And
  while the national debate rages on there have been 600 acts of
  vandalism, firebombings, sniper attacks, windows shattered. There
  is no way to measure the fear or count the death threats.&quot; 
  All this one-sided coverage has an effect on the public's
  perception of the pro-life movement. Reporter David Culhane
  conveyed the results of a CBS poll on this topic during the
  January 8 CBS Evening News: &quot; A new CBS poll shows that three out
  of four Americans say the protest tactics of some anti-abortion
  activists can be blamed for leading to the recent shootings at
  several abortion clinics.&quot; <p> 

  What about violence perpetrated by abortion advocates? In 1994, 
  only CNN reported (in passing) that Ernest Robertson Jr. tried to
  shoot a pro-life protester after picking up his wife outside a
  Baton Rouge, Louisiana abortion clinic. He shot once and missed,
  and then his gun jammed. He was later charged with attempted
  second-degree murder. But in 1995, the networks again
  demonstrated their pro-abortion bias by failing to report on
  harassment or threats of violence against pro-lifers, despite
  some important stories all the networks missed. <p>

  For example, Daniel Adam Mahoney was the first pro-abortion
  activist indicted under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances
  Act on April 11, 1995. Mahoney called a crisis pregnancy center,
  First Way of Wenatchee, Washington, on January 2 and threatened
  to kill the workers at the center. He also called the National
  Life Center hotline in New Jersey and told an operator he was
  going to shoot pro-life protesters outside abortion clinics. He
  pleaded guilty to both crimes on June 7. This was reported by the
  Associated Press and The New York Times, but never appeared on
  the networks. <p>

  Alice Hand was arrested in January 1995 for making at least three
  phone calls threatening to blow-up a Catholic church and school
  in Suffern, New York. Hand wanted revenge on the Catholic Church,
  which she believed was partly to blame for pro-life violence. The
  New York Times ran a 288-word story on January 17, but the
  incident never appeared on any of the networks. <p>

  While the networks devoted 142 stories to violence outside
  clinics, only three alluded to violence inside the clinics. CNN's
  September 12 World News broadcast one segment about abortionist David
  Benjamin, who was convicted of second degree murder in New York
  City for allowing a woman to bleed to death from a perforated
  uterus during an abortion. Not one segment mentioned the rate of
  abortions in the United States in 1993 or 1994, but two segments
  aired estimates in 1995. On the August 23 Today show, Dawn
  Fratangelo reported a new study estimated that &quot; one-quarter of
  the world's pregnancies end in abortion,&quot;  while the August 30 NBC
  Nightly News mentioned there are 1.5 million abortions per year
  in the United States. <p>

  With 1995 ushering in a new Republican-controlled Congress, the
  media predicted the death of the right to abortion while betting
  it would be an issue that threatens the survival of the Republican
  majority. After Senators voted to make the gruesome partial birth
  abortion procedure illegal on December 7, NBC's Bryant Gumbel
  opened the next day's Today show with this exaggerated claim:
  &quot; Good Morning. Congress is a step closer this morning to eliminating a
  woman's choice in abortion.&quot; <p>
  During the congressional fight over the nomination of Dr. Henry
  Foster as Surgeon General, NBC's Jim Miklaszewski on the February
  9 Today show felt this would eventually be a win for President
  Clinton: &quot; White House officials claim conservative Republicans
  want to turn Foster's nomination into a fight over abortion. In that
  case, Clinton aides admit they could still lose the nomination,
  but would ultimately win the war of public opinion over choice and
  help push the Republicans further right from center.&quot;  CBS anchor
  Connie Chung also saw abortion as bringing about the demise of the
  Republican Party on the February 15 CBS Evening News: &quot; Republican
  use of the abortion issue against Dr. Henry Foster's nomination
  as Surgeon General seems to be backfiring tonight. The deep stress
  cracks over abortion policy are now starting to show inside the
  Republican Party.&quot; <p>
  Once again, a year passed with the concerns of pro-lifers ignored
  by the networks. Women who regret abortions, how the abortion
  industry operates relatively free of government regulation, the
  large sums of money made by the abortion industry, government
  subsidies to Planned Parenthood -- all went unreported in 1995. <p>

  <h3>C. Homosexuality (113 total stories in 1995; 105 in
  1994; 756 in 1993)<p></h3>

  The number of stories primarily about homosexuality remained
  about the same between 1994 and 1995. Both years were much lower
  than 1993 when the gays in the military debate dominated the news
  for a few months. In 1995, 59 evening show segments were
  broadcast focusing on gay issues, the same number as in 1994.
  Morning shows aired 48 stories in 1995, up from the 37 broadcast
  in 1994.<p>

  Magazine show segments dropped from nine in 1994 to six in 1995. 
  But the networks demonstrated a liberal orientation once again:
  most of the segments featured gays in a positive light while
  rarely presenting those who opposed the gay agenda. In what few
  interview segments there were on the morning shows, the number of pro-gay
  agenda guests outnumbered the anti-gay agenda guests by thirteen
  to three. <p>

  <h3>D. Religious Right (17 evening stories in 1995; 12 in
  1994; 15 in 1993)<p></h3>

  In the 34 total segments and one hour CBS Reports special, the
  media reported on Christian conservatives in 1995 as an
  intolerant and divisive force in American politics willing to
  dishonestly manipulate voters into casting a ballot for their
  candidates. The label &quot; extremist&quot;  sometimes popped up in a
  discussion of Christian conservatives. Bryant Gumbel asked Gary
  Hart on the October 17 Today: &quot; How do you view the GOP's
  courtship of the extreme and religious right?&quot; <p>

  The networks portrayed the Christian Coalition as a negative
  force in the Republican Party. Today co-host Katie Couric
  reflected this view in a February 13 interview with Ralph Reed
  about the effect his organization, the Christian Coalition, would
  have on the presidential race: &quot; Do you believe, Mr. Reed, that
  your stand will divide the Republican Party in a way that will
  make it difficult, if not impossible, to win in the election in
  1996? And isn't that what went wrong in the last election for
  George Bush?&quot;  On the September 8 CBS Evening News, Linda Douglass
  also saw sure defeat for a candidate with Christian right
  support: &quot; Christian conservatives may not have the power to
  anoint a candidate, but they might be able to defeat one.
  Embracing their views may help to win the Republican nomination,
  but it could cost votes in the general election.&quot; <p>

  While the networks would not suggest that a liberal group like
  the NAACP doesn't represent all black people, CBS suggested the
  Christian Coalition did not represent all Christians -- or
  suggested they were less than Christian. Rather introduced
  Douglass's September 8 story by noting Phil Gramm &quot; was at a
  meeting of preacher Pat Robertson's political group, the one calling
  itself the Christian Coalition.&quot;  Four months earlier, on May 15, Rather
  charged: &quot; The group calling itself the Christian Coalition is
  aligned with hard-right stands on issues ranging from gay rights
  to school prayer, and it's demanding its due for its help in getting
  Republicans elected.&quot; The networks also suggested conservatives weren't honest about
  their politics. Paula Zahn's question on the November 15 This
  Morning to the director of the liberal Texas Freedom Alliance:
  &quot; Hasn't some of your criticism been, though, that they have
  funded stealth candidates? That these people have not been honest about
  what their agenda is as they go around campaigning?&quot;       
  Some of the worst bias towards the Christian right was broadcast
  during the murder trial of Susan Smith, who drowned her two sons.
  The same media which decried Newt Gingrich's 1992
  characterization of Woody Allen having Democratic family values took a gratuitous
  slap at the Christian Coalition. Both CBS and NBC aired reports
  mentioning, as NBC reporter Bob Dotson described on July 28, that
  Susan Smith's &quot; stepfather, Bev Russell, former Republican Party
  chairman and once active in the Christian Coalition, began
  molesting Susan just before her 16th birthday.&quot; <p>

  The usually little covered religious left garnered a few pieces
  during the year. These segments were mostly platforms for the
  religious left to attack the religious right. NBC's Bob Abernethy
  profiled leftist activist Rev. Jim Wallis who mounted a campaign
  to bash Christian pro-family conservatives. Anchor Brian Williams
  introduced the May 20 piece: "The religious right is continuing a
  political offensive it started a few years ago but there is a
  growing number of religious people who find the conservative
  agenda offensive.&quot; <p>

  Abernethy then aired Wallis's attack: &quot; His biggest problem with
  the Christian Coalition is its programs towards the poor. Wallis
  is a founder of Sojourners Religious Community which believes
  Christianity requires ministry to the poor.&quot;  Then Abernethy posed
  the question, &quot; And when Christians identify with the rich and
  powerful?&quot;  Wallis replied, &quot; I don't want to overstate this but I
  think that's a heresy. &quot;   Abernethy left out the far-left agenda of
  Sojourners, the magazine that Wallis edited; nor did he mention
  that Wallis was once quoted as saying he hoped &quot; more Christians
  will view the world through Marxist eyes.&quot;  Network coverage
  suggested the &quot; stealth&quot;  political tactics of the religious are
  newsworthy only if they are coming from the right. <p>

<h2>IV. RECOMMENDATIONS AND FOLLOW-UP</h2>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
Network coverage of religion and religious issues would improve
considerably if reporters, producers, and anchors would work
harder on the following items:<p>
<ol>
<li> Devote more resources and air time to covering religion news.
The networks have no excuse to keep religion news in a
one-percent ghetto. The role of religion in the larger society,
from private philanthropy to political struggles like Henry
Foster's Surgeon General nomination, were eminently newsworthy
and attention-grabbing in 1995, and yet the networks continue to
slight religion as a major motivating force in Americans' private
and public lives.<p> 

<li> When covering religion, try harder to present religious issues
in a fair-minded, objective way. Network reporters are veterans
at the top of their field. Surely, they cannot protest they don't
know how to present both sides of a story, and they cannot
protest that stories attacking traditional religious "dogma"
without an opposing view is objective journalism. Reporters
should balance the Pope with his critics, but you can't balance a
story with 25 soundbites of critics and no defenders.<p>

<li> Present the social positions of religious figures fairly and
without contempt. The networks continue to label traditional
religious positions on social issues as &quot; extreme&quot;  or &quot; hard
right.&quot;  Is that label accurate for many Catholic clergymen who
are opposed to abortion, but also opposed to capital punishment
and current welfare reform proposals? Ideological identification
is useful to viewers, but current practices serve more to
stigmatize and caricature religious figures. More nuance and
balance is essential.<p>

Reporters also signal their contempt by underlining their opinion
that traditional religious stands are unpopular. An earlier Media
Research Center study of print and network abortion coverage from
July 1994 through June 1995 found that 48 stories suggested
abortion would damage Republican chances for election, while only
one story suggested it would help. But how does that jibe with
the fact that not one pro-life incumbent lost in the 1994
elections? <p>

<li> Hire a religion reporter, and reporters who are religious. ABC
hired Peggy Wehmeyer early in 1994, and she remains the only
explicitly assigned religion reporter at the networks. Wehmeyer
reported 11 stories in ABC's significantly longer &quot; American
Agenda&quot;  format in 1995, the same number as 1994. Wehmeyer was
outnumbered by full-time general assignment reporter Bill
Blakemore, who often covered the Pope for ABC. Time religion
writer Richard Ostling logged six stories for PBS. NBC's Bob
Abernethy continued as a semi-retired &quot; contributing correspondent
on religion.&quot;  CNN and CBS have yet to hire a regular religion
correspondent. The hostile, even partisan tone of some program
content suggests no effort to increase people of faith in the
newsroom. The strong dedication national journalism organizations
publicly declare toward diversity in the newsroom is still
unextended to people of faith.<p>
</ol>
Some recommendations from past MRC studies have led to better
reporting. In 1993, 25 network news stories focused on
unsubstantiated charges of sexual abuse made against Joseph
Cardinal Bernardin. Like 1994, the networks did refrain from
sensationalism in covering serious charges of clerical sexual
abuse. We also recommended that religion news not follow the
formula that `good news is no news.' <p>

On this front, the networks continue to show improvement: Network
reporters did show viewers some examples of the good news that
religion brings to America. On the November 7 World News Tonight,
ABC's Peter Jennings made a startling discovery: &quot; In Texas, there
is a faith-based program which has been remarkably effective in
dealing with alcohol and drug addiction. It does not cost the
taxpayers a cent." Peggy Wehmeyer reported: &quot; A recent University
of Tennessee study showed that 70 percent of Teen Challenge
[program] graduates were drug-free after six months,&quot;  compared
with a state-funded rehabilitation specialist's suggestion that a
25 percent rate would be &quot; very good.&quot;  Acknowledgments that
religion can lead to a better society, in both large systemic
strokes and much smaller personal revelations, might serve as a
comforting respite from the &quot; hell in a handbasket&quot;  tone so many
Americans associate with the network news.

<U><CENTER><a name="2flash1-6.html"> <font size="8"><I>Tell the Truth!</I> </font size="8"></A>
</B></I> </CENTER></U>
<BR>
<P>On June 5, Media Research Center Chairman Brent Bozell held a national press 
conference in Washington, D.C. to formally announce our $2.8 million<B> "Tell the 
Truth!"</B> campaign to confront and neutralize the anti-conservative bias in the media during the `96 election season.
<P>At the press conference, Bozell told reporters that surveys confirm what some in 
the media are finally admitting. "CBS's 
Bernard Goldberg said it best: `The old argument 
that the networks and other "media elites" have 
a liberal bias is so blatantly true it's hardly worth discussing 
any more.'
<P>"The MRC is not out to prove an anti-conservative bias. That argument is over," 
Bozell stated. "We want to put an end to this 
non-stop onslaught against the conservative movement. 
This campaign demands the media be fair and balanced, period," 
he continued.
<P>Media outlets covering the press conference included 
C-SPAN, CNN, CBN, Reuters, Cox, <I>The</I> <I>Washington 
Post</I>, <I>National Review</I>, <I>Chicago 
Sun-Times</I>, <I>Investor's Business 
Daily</I>, and others.
"Tell the Truth!" is the most ambitious and technologically 
advanced campaign ever devised to confront leftist media bias. 
Based on test-marketing results, we will expose left-wing media bias to an average 
of 50,000 conservative activists and 25 million voters every week. 
<I><B>The media will not get away with distortions or falsehoods this year.</B></I>
<p>
<BR>
<BR>
 <I><CENTER><font size="5">There are nine components to the campaign:</font size="5"></CENTER></I>
<P>
<BR>
<B>1. Research:</B> The cornerstone of all MRC endeavors, the campaign research will 
be compiled by our eight-member media analysis team which tapes and analyzes every 
network newscast, national newspaper, and news magazine to document trends of 
liberal bias. Using the customized MRC Media 
Tracking
 System, the "Tell the Truth!" 
campaign will show the American people <I>exactly 
</I>how the media are distorting the issues -- 
even spiking the news -- in order to promote their pro-Clinton agenda this year.
<P><B>2. Publications:</B> All of the MRC's 
monthly and bi-weekly publications -- 
<I>MediaWatch</I>, <I>MediaNomics</I>, <I>Notable 
Quotables</I>, and <I>Flash </I> -- will focus almost exclusively on the 
issuesand trends of campaign `96, giving thousands of conservative reporters, subscribers, and activists the unique and timely information which they can use as ammunition in their grassroots activism.
<P><B>3. <I>Pattern of Deception</I>:</B><I> </I>MRC 
Associate Editor Tim Graham's new blockbuster book documents the astonishing bias that has 
bolstered the Clinton presidency in the last four years, setting the stage for a national 
discussion of the media's obvious preference for this President. 
<I>Pattern of Deception</I> has already generated great interest among 
the general public, and become one of our best selling publications.
<P><B>4. Talk Radio:</B> Over the past year we 
have quietly established an informal network of over 100 radio talk shows 
-- which includes every major nationally syndicated show -- 
to provide them with up-to-the-minute evidence of left-wing bias masquerading as 
"objective news" in the establishment press. Using MRC material, talk show hosts can now educate millions of voters about the 
ongoing distortion of the "news" media every 
single day. As well, MRC spokesmen are now conducting daily interviews on these shows 
to further expose the liberal media.
<P><B>5. The Internet:</B> Using the Internet, the MRC will be communicating with 
hundreds of thousands of conservative activists 
while simultaneously providing immediate intelligence to the conservative media. The 
MRC website  <a href="http://www.mediaresearch.org">http://www.mediaresearch.org</a> is up and running for public and media 
use during the 1996 campaign, with a full slate of studies, profiles, and Special Reports. In addition, MRC Executive Director Brent Baker is providing "CyberAlerts" through E-mail several times per week to the nation's most influential opinion leaders to facilitate a rapid response to media bias.  
<P><B>6. Media Outreach:</B> Two-page &quot;Media Reality Check '96&quot; rebuttals are 
being sent via &quot;blast fax&quot; to over 1,500 media and political contacts across 
the country on a regular basis. This rapid response technique, honed to 
perfection by the Clinton campaign in 1992, inundated the media with 
counterarguments and rebuttals to anything the Republicans had to say. Now we're 
using it against the leftist media.  
<P><B>7. The National Conventions:</B> During the national conventions, 
the media's left-wing agenda comes shining through. Once again, the MRC 
will be there, publishing a daily newsletter during the two parties' conventions 
to document the ongoing political slant in prime time convention coverage. 
In addition, we will be conducting interviews and press conferences to 
broadcast our findings. This year the MRC is also considering a daily national 
radio feed to provide evidence of reporters' biased coverage. This daily 
commentary will reach tens of millions of voters and activists.
<P><B>8. Conservative Grassroots Activism:</B> To make the so-called 
objective national media an issue in this campaign, the MRC is mass-producing 
and distributing hundreds of thousands of bumper stickers, pens, 
refrigerator magnets, and other novelty items with the tag line &quot;I Don't Believe the 
Liberal News Media.&quot; The national 
distribution efforts are already under way. MRC Members -- 75,000 nationwide -- 
will also participate through letter-writing campaigns and other efforts to 
expose and confront liberal bias at the local level.
<P><B>9. Paid Advertising: </B>The MRC will be advancing its efforts through a 
paid advertising campaign. Conservative newspapers, magazines, and radio 
talk shows will be the vehicles of choice for these efforts. So far the MRC 
has placed several advertisements in <I>Human 
Events</I> and the <I>Washington Times Weekly</I>, and we will be buying 
advertisements in <I>National Review</I> and 
<I>The American Spectator</I>. Funds permitting, ads will air on radio and television 
as well.<BR>

<b><center><i><font size="5">MRC Family Hour Campaign Gets Results</font size="5"></i></center></b>
<br>
<br>
<P>The Media Research Center's campaign to bring the spirit 
          of the Family Hour back to prime time television has achieved 
national attention and impressive results. 
<P>At the end of April, the MRC organized a coalition of United States 
Senators and Representatives to issue a bi-partisan challenge to the 
television networks to voluntarily bring back the spirit of the Family Hour. 
Over 70 members of Congress signed a letter urging network 
entertainment executives to voluntarily broadcast only shows advocating 
positive family values during the first hour of prime time. The letter appeared 
as a full-page ad purchased by the MRC in the show-business newspaper 
<I>Daily Variety</I>.
<P>MRC Chairman Brent Bozell followed up with a lobbying effort 
directed at ABC Entertainment President Ted Harbert asking him to renew the 
highly acclaimed family drama <I>Second Noah</I>, which debuted this past February 
and whose survival hung in the balance.The advertisement and lobbying effort had demonstrable results.
 <P>On May 20, ABC announced that <I>Second 
Noah</I> would be included on its fall schedule, to air Saturdays at 
8 p.m. EDT. Subsequently, the show's creator and executive producer, 
Pamela Long, enthusiastically thanked Bozell and the MRC, writing that 
the <I>Daily Variety</I> ad &quot;struck just the 
right chord. And Ted Harbert...heard you loud and clear.&quot;       
<P>Bozell's &quot;eloquent letter to Mr. Harbert had a definitive impact on 
the decision-making process at the network,&quot; echoed Jacqueline 
Lovejoy, the show's publicist. &quot;[His] voice 
was powerful, and it was heard.&quot;
<P>Brandon Tartikoff, chairman of New World Television, 
<I>Second Noah</I>`s production company, has also 
recognized the MRC's work on the program's behalf. Tartikoff told 
<I>Flash</I> that &quot;support by Brent Bozell and his 
joint efforts with members of Congress... not only influenced ABC's decision 
to pick up the show, but also influenced the placement of 
<I>Second Noah</I> on Saturday nights, among the best times 
for family viewing.&quot; <BR>
<center><h2><I>The Top Ten Least and Most Family Friendly Shows of 
1995-'96</I></center>
</h2>
As MRC studies have shown, while the number of youth-targeted prime time series incorporating pernicious content has increased, wholesome shows are also gaining strength. The MRC's Entertainment Division recently released its &quot;Top Ten&quot; list of the least family-friendly prime time shows, but also saluted several programs which respect and uphold traditional values.
<P>
<P><I>The Top Ten Least and Most Family Friendly Shows of 
1995-'96</I>, which has been distributed to thousands of 
journalists, is the culmination of thousands of hours of television analysis. As 
of press time, this annual season-end tally has received widespread coverage 
in several major media outlets, including <I>USA 
Today</I>,<I> The Washington Post</I>, and the<I> Los Angeles 
Times</I>. It was even mentioned on the<I> Tonight 
Show</I>. 
<h3><P><B><center>The Top Ten Worst Shows:</center></B></h3>
<P>1.<B><I>Married...with Children</B></I> (Fox) Sunday 
9:00 p.m. EST
<P>The crudest comedy on prime time television, 
<I>Married</I> routinely ridicules the family. Every 
week members of the &quot;Bundys&quot; trade insults, 
celebrate promiscuity, and revel in bathroom 
humor; this raunchfest's dialogue is peppered with 
lewd punch lines about sex, masturbation, the gay 
lifestyle, and the lead character's fondness for pornographic magazines 
and strip clubs.
<P>2. <B><I>Friends </B></I>(NBC) Thursday 8:00 
p.m. EST
<P><I>Friends</I> has not toned down its adult content 
despite the show's shift to the earlier 8 o'clock hour. 
Virtually every episode revolves around sexual themes and contains 
inappropriate language. Each of the six central characters, 
all single twentysomethings, is sexually active. 
Additionally, the sitcom promotes gay parenting and same-sex marriages as viable options.
<P>3. <B><I>Roseanne</B></I> (ABC) Tuesday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>Like<I> Friends, Roseanne</I>'s move to the 8:00 p.m. time slot has done 
little to mitigate the show's obnoxious content. The series' central characters 
are openly derisive of their parents; religion and the 
religious are mocked; foul language is frequent; 
premarital sex is condoned; and  gay marriage is championed.
<P>4. <B><I>Melrose Place</B></I> (Fox) Monday 
8:00 p.m. EST
<P><I>Melrose</I>'s randy regulars are constantly 
in and out of one another's beds, engaging in premarital and extramarital sex. 
Prime time's sexiest soap also showcases the gay lifestyle, with one gay 
character gaining a live-in lover this season.
<P>5. <B><I>A Season in Purgatory</B></I> (CBS) 
Mini-series
<P>Based on a Dominick Dunne novel, <I>Season</I> showcased members of 
a supposedly devout Catholic family promoting their faith in public 
while privately engaging in a vast array of premarital and extramarital 
affairs, rape, murder, and scandalous cover-up schemes. 
<P>6. <B><I>Central Park West</B></I> (CBS) 
Wednesday 9:00 p.m. EST (Canceled)
<P>One of the most hyped entries on last fall's schedule, 
<I>CPW</I> condoned premarital sex and adultery, 
and aired scenes containing foul language and explicitly sexual 
content. Fortunately, the acting and writing were so poor that very few viewers tuned in to its 
sordidness, and it was canceled.
<P>7. <B><I>The Dana Carvey Show</B></I> (ABC) 
Tuesday 9:30 EST (Canceled)
<P>The popular comedian shocked viewers and sponsors with 
obscenity-laden skits and extremely crude content. After many advertisers 
withdrew their support and ratings began to wane, ABC pulled the show off the air.
<P>8. <B><I>Cybill</B></I> (CBS) Sunday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P><I>Cybill</I>'s storylines frequently test the limits of decency. Dialogue is 
littered with foul language, sexual innuendo, and suggestive scenarios. 
The sitcom's regulars frequently belittle the institution of marriage. Casual sex 
-- even among teenagers -- is condoned.
<P>9. <B><I>Beverly Hills, 90210 </B></I>(Fox) 
Wednesday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>While one character has steadfastly refused to lose her virginity, 
other members of <I>90210</I>'s tanned and trendy cast have been more than happy 
to promote premarital sex as a natural -- and completely inconsequential --  
fact of college life. The teen-targeted soap sends mixed messages on drugs. 
Some protagonists deride substance abuse, but rarely do they ever address the illegality of drug use.
<P>10.<B><I> Martin</B></I> (Fox) Thursday 8:00 
p.m. EST
<P>The sex lives of the two newlywed protagonists and their single 
friends serve as fodder for the raunchy humor pervading this sitcom. Most 
of <I>Martin</I>'s episodes contain dialogue fraught with sexual references and 
obscene language.

<br>
<h3><P><B><center>The Most Family-Friendly Shows of 1995-`96:</center></h3></B>
<P>
<br>
<B><I>Touched by an Angel</B></I> (CBS) Saturday 9:00 p.m. EST
<P>One of CBS' few success stories of the season, 
<I>Touched By an Angel</I> is the most outspoken proponent of 
traditional values on the prime time schedule. The inspiring drama 
showcases God's message of unconditional love, illuminates the power of 
prayer, and promotes compassion and strengthening family ties. 
<I>Touched By an Angel</I>, almost canceled last year 
by CBS, was the fastest growing series on the network and the second 
fastest growing show on prime time during the 1995-`96 season. 
<P><B><I>Second Noah</B></I> (ABC) Saturday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>This mid-season replacement about a novelist, his veterinarian 
wife, and their eight adopted children is one of prime time's most 
pro-family offerings. Storylines depict respect for parental authority as the key to 
a strong family unit, and advocate premarital chastity, individual 
responsibility, and faith.
<P><B><I>Kirk</B></I> (WB) Sunday 8:30 p.m. EST
<P>The cornerstone of WB's family-friendly line-up, every episode 
of <I>Kirk</I> reiterates the importance of family. The title character, a 
young man suddenly charged with the upbringing of his three younger 
siblings, willingly makes many personal sacrifices to ensure 
that the children are receiving a sound moral upbringing. The show 
imparts the merits of hard work, faith, patience, and taking 
responsibility for one's actions.
<P>   <BR>
<B><I>Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman</B></I> (CBS) 
Saturday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P><I>Dr. Quinn</I>'s promotion of family values has 
endeared it to audiences of all ages. Marriage and 
family are staunchly promoted, as are honesty, compassion, and 
respect for parental authority. The drama boasts one of 
prime time's most positive clerics, &quot;the Reverend.&quot; A 
series regular, he is depicted as an intelligent, 
caring, and dedicated member of the community.
<P><B><I>Home Improvement</B></I> (ABC) Tuesday  9:00 p.m. EST
<P>This popular sitcom remains a reliable family staple. Focusing 
primarily on the relationships between a cable TV host, his wife, and their 
children, <I>Home Improvement</I> has taught valuable lessons about teenage 
drinking, honesty, respect, and the importance of education. One of prime 
time's foremost advocates of the institution of marriage, the show frequently addresses the 
challenges faced by the husband and wife and the 
steps they take toward strengthening their relationship. 
<P><B><I>Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of 
Superman</B></I> (ABC) Sunday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P><I>Lois &amp; Clark</I> abandoned the suggestive 
dialogue and sexual references of its 1993-'94 inaugural season, and, 
in the words of series star Teri Hatcher, is now &quot;the family show 
to watch.&quot; The show's cleverly scripted storylines prove that 
television needn't appeal to the lowest common denominator to provide 
quality entertainment. Dialogue and fast-paced action sequences are free 
of offensive language and sexual innuendo, and the newly engaged 
protagonists promote premarital chastity.
<P><B><I>The Parent `Hood</B></I> (WB) Sunday 7:30 p.m. EST
<P>Another winning offering from WB, <I>The Parent 
`Hood'</I>s central characters provide positive 
role models for viewers of all ages. The happily married black 
couple, both successful professionals, teach their children 
that education, self-discipline and integrity are keys to 
success. The positive impact of a father in the household, 
family loyalty, and postponing sex until marriage are 
also underscored.

<h2><center>MRC CyberAlerts Conservative Journalists</center></h2>
<P></B><BR>
<P>In response to the growing demand for MRC research, we are using 
state-of-the-art technology to reach conservative leaders instantaneously. Several 
          times a week MRC Executive Director Brent Baker sends &quot;CyberAlert&quot; 
messages via electronic mail to a network of talk radio hosts and key 
conservative leaders in the media. 
<P>Each conservative journalist receives the latest intelligence on the leftist 
media. CyberAlerts' subjects have included the findings from the recent 
Roper Center poll for the Freedom Forum, which showed that 89 percent of 
Washington journalists voted for Clinton, and that only 2 percent considered 
themselves conservative. 
<P>The CyberAlert membership list has grown to include heavy hitters like 
talk show hosts <B>G. Gordon Liddy</B> (nationally syndicated), 
<B>Neal Boortz</B> (WSB, Atlanta), <B>David 
Brudnoy</B> (WBZ, Boston), <B>Mark Davis</B> (WBAP, Fort Worth), 
<B>Jim Eason</B> (KGO, San Francisco), <B>David 
Gold</B> (KLIF, Dallas), <B>Jason Lewis</B> (KSTP, St. 
 Paul), <B>Jan Mickelson</B> (WHO, Des Moines), 
<B>Wes Minter</B> (KCMO, Kansas City), <B>Mike 
Rosen</B> (KOA, Denver), and <B>Barry Young</B> (KFYI, Phoenix). Newspaper 
columnists like <B>Evan Gahr</B> from the <I>New York 
Post</I>, <B>Dick Williams </B>from the <I>Atlanta 
Journal</I>, <B>Don Feder</B> from the <I>Boston 
Herald</I>; and nationally syndicated columnists 
<B>Cal Thomas</B> and <B>Arianna Huffington</B> also use these alerts in 
their stories. Others receiving CyberAlerts include 
<I>The American Spectator</I>'s Editor-in-Chief  
<B>R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr.</B>, and Executive Editor 
<B>Wladyslaw Pleszczynski</B>; <B>Tony Snow</B> from 
<I>Fox News Sunday</I>; and <B>Fred Barnes</B>, the Executive 
Editor of <I>The</I> <I>Weekly Standard</I>.
<P>Overnight these CyberAlerts have become an essential tool for 
conservatives in the media fighting the blatant liberal bias that pervades the mainstream 
media. <br>
<p>
<br>
<b><i><center>And here's some feedback we've received from our CyberAlerts:</center></i></b>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<P>Today's &quot;Media Reality Check&quot; is unbelievably 
<U>great</U> (did it on my radio show). 
You're doing great work.
You were great on Rush , too.
<blockquote>-- A personal note from Mary Matalin, CBS radio talk    
 show host.</blockquote>
<p>
 "As always you are doing a simply superb and bang-up job! I use your material on my show almost every day. Needless to say, your daily updates are 
excellent...&quot; <blockquote>-- Barry Young at KFYI in Phoenix.</blockquote>
<p>
&quot;Thanks...these things are great.&quot; <blockquote>-- Doug Kellett at 
WRCG in Columbus, Georgia.</blockquote>
<P>&quot;You're sending great stuff. Could you add 
<I>World</I>'s Managing Editor Nick Eicher to your distribution list?&quot;  
 <blockquote>-- Marvin Olasky, Editor of <I>World</I> magazine.</blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Vice President Dan Quayle was very intrigued about the 
press' coverage of the Israeli election. He may 
write his weekly column on this subject next week. Do you have 
any more information?&quot; <blockquote>-- Brad Newby from the office of Dan Quayle.</blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Thanks always, for the terrific job and resource you're providing.&quot; 
<blockquote>-- Wes Minter at KCMO, in Kansas City.</blockquote>   
<P>&quot;You're doing a fabulous job! Keep up the 
pressure.&quot; <blockquote>-- Cal Thomas, syndicated columnist.</blockquote>
<P>&quot;I think this fax and E-mail system will spread your 
message more quickly and effectively. Speaking of that, could you add 
my TV colleague, Bill Shipp to your list? [He] now lives in 
Newt's district, puts out a newsletter, and sends his very 
conservative column to 43 newspapers in Georgia.&quot; 
 <blockquote>-- Dick Williams.</blockquote>

<p><br><br>
<h2><B><center>MRC Editor on Entitlement Reform</center></B></h2>
<P>Did you know that if Social Security and Medicare are not reformed, future generations may face tax rates as high as 84 
percent? Or that more young people believe in UFOs than believe they 
will ever get any money from Social Security? You may not have known 
of these unpleasant facts because no one in the media reports them.
<P>But entitlement reform is becoming an increasingly important issue 
in conservative circles, and the MRC is part of the dialogue. Recently 
Tim Lamer, director of the MRC's Free Market Project, participated in a 
panel discussion hosted by the Heritage Foundation's Third Generation 
Program, a series of lectures for young conservatives. Representatives from the Cato Institute and the 
Heritage Foundation also served on the panel while many young conservatives 
from various think tanks and Capitol Hill attended 
the discussion.
<P>All four panelists reflected on why, with the 
impending retirement of the Baby Boom generation, 
entitlement reform is the most important econ-omic 
issue facing young people. Lamer addressed why reforming these programs should be a major concern for all wings of 
the conservative movement and how the movement can bring media 
attention to bear on the issue.<BR>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<h2><B><center>Broader Project Replaces FEMI</center></b></h2>

In order to reflect its new, broad-
      ened focus, the MRC's Free 
      Enterprise &amp; Media Institute (FEMI) has changed its name to 
the <B>Free Market Project</B>.
<P>Beginning this year, the Free Market Project is undertaking 
joint projects with other conservative public policy or business organizations 
to help them educate reporters about their particular concerns. 
Currently, the Free Market Project is engaged in a joint project with Consumer Alert, 
the free-market consumer group, to study how popular consumer 
publications cover business and free enterprise. These projects give the 
conservative movement and the business community the scientific research they need 
to educate the media regarding their biases, and to confront them directly 
if necessary.
<P>In addition to the new joint projects, the Free Market Project 
will continue to publish the newsletter 
<I>MediaNomics</I> on a monthly basis, and FEMI's Quarterly Breakfast Forums, 
designed to educate the media about free enterprise issues, will continue 
to be held every few months.

On May 28, millions 
          of Americans 
          learned exactly how the left-wing press 
are distorting the news thanks to Media Research 
Center Chairman Brent Bozell's stint as guest host of 
Rush Limbaugh's nationally syndicated radio show, 
the most popular program in history. 
<P>Bozell briefed the audience (over 20 million 
listeners, cumulatively) not only on the leftist political 
slant in the news media, but on the cultural war being 
waged in Hollywood as well.
<P>During the show's second hour, Bozell interviewed Hollywood 
legend and fellow conservative activist Charlton Heston, 
who has done more than any other Hollywood figure, aside from Ronald Reagan, to help elect 
conservatives while advancing our cause. Heston is currently 
raising money for the newly formed Arena PAC, 
which was created to elect conservative candidates to 
federal office and to mobilize conservatives in the 
entertainment industry.
<P>One of the highlights of the final hour of the 
radio show was an interview with Republican National 
Committee Chairman Haley Barbour. In addition to addressing the liberal 
media's effect on politics and American culture, 
Bozell asked Barbour what conservatives should do to 
further their ideas and programs. &quot;You have to 
understand that you can't rely on the mainstream media,&quot; 
replied the RNC Chairman. &quot;One of the reasons talk radio 
has exploded in popularity in this country in recent 
years, is that people see that the media elites are liberal, 
and they come at things from their perspective and 
people are looking for another source.&quot; 
<P>Bozell later offered his insights on the 
current campaigns, giving this advice to Dole and other 
conservatives: &quot; They ought to be distinguishing 
themselves from the Democrats. They ought to be 
playing hardball politics with the Democrats. They've got 
the truth on their side. They ought to stop reading 
the <I>Washington Post </I>and listening to the networks 
and thinking that they reflect reality. They ought to 
listen to the voters out there. Look at the surveys -- 
the surveys are all on their side.&quot;
<P>Limbaugh has asked Bozell to return as a guest to discuss the media's 
left-wing agenda -- a welcome invitation given that 
such exposure would normally cost millions of dollars 
if purchased as advertising time.

<center><h2>Letter from the Chairman</h2></center>
<b>Dear MRC Member,</b>
<p>
<dd><big>W</big>elcome to <i>Flash</i>, the new monthly newsletter pub-lished exclusively for Media Research Center Members.
<dd>Why a membership newsletter? Actually, the idea is rather simple -- and overdue. Recently we conducted a survey of our supporters to see how well we were keeping you informed about our work at the Media Research Center. 
<dd>The results told me we needed to do a better job.  Members supporting our Entertainment Division efforts weren't aware of the work of the News Division. Subscribers to our newsletters didn't know we had recently opened an office in Hollywood, the Parents' Television Council. PTC supporters aren't following the work of our Free Enterprise and Media Institute. And so on. 
<dd>The survey pointed to the need for a publication for MRC members only. Hence, <i>Flash</i>.
<dd>Each month <i>Flash</i> will serve as your connector to the MRC and its special projects, giving you the timely information on the many projects you are sup-porting through your membership.  Our newsletters. Books. Media appearances. Special reports. Studies. Press releases. Our nationally syndicated column. And much, much  more. 
<dd>Through your newsletter you will also be apprised of  Members' discounts on our merchandise and publications.
<dd>We want you to be abreast of what's going on here and how your gifts make it possible for us to expose and challenge the liberal media.
<dd>As a supporter of the MRC, you understand that the national news media have used their power to promote their left wing views. 
And thanks to you, now the public is on to them, too!
<dd>The Times Mirror Corporation took a survey which shows that 43 percent of the public today believes the national news media set the national agenda. You and I have known that for years. Now, through our efforts, the public is catching on!
<dd>There is another critical front, the cultural wars raging in the entertainment industry. The MRC, through its Parents' Tele-vision Council arm, is leading the fight for pro-family values in entertainment fare. The PTC's mission is to bring responsible, family oriented programming to television, and to organize and mobilize Hollywood conservatives as national spokesmen for our cause.
<dd>The Media Research Center is the largest, most active organization in America identifying, exposing and confronting the liberal agenda of the news and entertainment industries. You make that possible with your support.
<dd> In these pages you'll see why <i>Time</i> (grudgingly) admitted that, "for quality, resources and sheer volume of output, the new star on the right is the Media Research Center."
<dd>We hope you enjoy Flash. And we welcome any questions, comments or suggestions you may have. Please contact us at 1-800-MRC-1423. Or drop me a line. It's always good to hear from you.
<p> 
Sincerely,
<p>

L. Brent Bozell III

<center><h2>Networks Gnawing at Newt</h2></center>
<dd><big>T</big>he national news media continue to ignore political scandals involving the Clinton administration, but wouldn't dare miss an opportunity to report any allegations, no matter how far fetched, against Republicans. MRC's news media analysts regularly follow this trend and expose the reporting of political scandals.
<dd>The results are predictable: biased reporting, chock-full of half-truths and outright distortions.
<dd>Take Newt Gingrich's book deal, for example.
<dd>The media have decided to link bulk sales of Gingrich's book, <i>To Renew America</i>, with violations by former Speaker Jim Wright with his book, <i>Reflections of a Public Man</i>. CNN <i>Prime News</i> anchor Linden Soles introduced a Bob Franken story: "This could be a case of what goes around come around," referring to Gingrich's expose of Wright's bulk book sales violation, which led to his resignation. 
<dd>An article in <i>Newsweek</i> went so far as to claim, "Former Speaker Jim Wright dismissed a pudgy, loudmouthed back-bencher named Newt Gingrich right up to the day in 1989 when Gingrich's guerrilla campaign forced Wright's resignation from the House. Now it appears that Gingrich has made exactly the same mistake".
<p>
<font size=+1><i><center>What the media know, but didn't tell you, is that <br>the two deals have nothing in common.</center></i></font>
<p>
<dd>What the media know, but didn't tell you, is that the two deals have nothing in common.
<dd>Wright's book deal gave him an outrageously high royalty of 55 percent -- from a publisher who happened to be a former employee.  Gingrich only earned the standard 15 percent from a real publisher. Wright's book was never even sold in bookstores, it was of-fered almost exclusively in bulk sales to lobbyists -- enabling him to get around House limits on honoraria income. 
<dd>Gingrich's book was a genuine commercial property, lasting 12-weeks on the best-seller list (selling close to a half-million books). In addition, the Gingrich book had a grand total of five bulk orders,  totaling just over 500 books.
<dd>Wright was charged with 69 counts of ethics violations -- and resigned in disgrace before being indicted.
<dd>Or take the case of another Democrat, former Speaker Tom Foley.  In 1993 the <i>Boston Globe</i> reported the SEC fined an investment firm $100,000 for giving friends preferential treatment with new stock offerings -- one friend being the former Speaker -- and the networks didn't even blink. Small investors like Foley are generally not privy to initial public offerings (IPOs).
<dd>With this information, Foley was reported to have reaped profits on eleven out of twelve initial public IPOs offered to him the previous year. And yet only one network (CNN's <i>Inside Politics</i>) covered the story! The rest completely ignored Foley's investments.
<dd>Our news analysts uncover these facts, then distribute them to millions of people around the country on a regular basis. Research like this is made possible thanks to your support.

<center><h2>FEMI Calls Journalists On The Carpet</h2></center>
<h3>Here's a Pop Quiz:</h3>

<dd><big>R</big>epublicans in Congress propose to balance the budget while increasing spending by 50 percent over 7 years.
<dd>President Clinton calls this a massive cut and shuts down the government for about a week in protest.
<dd>Guess which side the media took.
<dd>It wasn't difficult to predict that they would parrot Mr. Clinton's point of view. That's what they usually do. But something needed to be done about it, or else the American people wouldn't hear the truth.
<dd>That's where the MRC's Free Enterprise and Media Institute steps in. After analyzing the biased coverage of the first few days of the shutdown, FEMI issued a rapid-response study rebutting the media's liberal spin. 
<dd>In the middle of the shutdown, the study of the first few days' coverage was faxed to hundreds of journalists, press secretaries on Capitol Hill, and prominent conservatives.
<dd>The study found that journalists were refusing to report that spending under the GOP plan was actually increasing; and that reporters were only interviewing people upset about the shutdown while ignoring the nearly half of all Americans who thought it wasn't a problem.
<dd>Lo and behold, coverage started to change! The night after we faxed out the study, NBC News produced a report showing how most people outside the beltway weren't put off by the shutdown.  
<dd>An on December 12, ABC's <i>Nightline</i> exposed Mr. Clinton for lying about GOP "cuts." They actually showed, with a graph on screen, how Republicans were planning on increasing federal spending.
<dd>Keeping the media on their toes is our mission! But we need your help in order to continue this fight.

<center><h2><i>Family Guide</i> Gives Parents the Facts</h2></center>

<dd><big>P</big>arents are fed up with the values their children are learning from network television. This year it's worse than ever.  The four major networks appear to be engaged in a fierce competition for the dubious honor of seeing just how many obscenities, lewd remarks, and sexual situations they can pack into a nighttime television program.
<dd>And the family hour -- the  8 p.m.. time slot dedicated for children's programming -- is now the time slot for some of the worst programming of them all.
<dd>As much as parents may want to do it, there's no way anyone can monitor everything on network television today. This year there are over 90 different programs on network prime time television alone. That's all changed now.
<dd>Through our West Coast office, the Parents' Television Council, we have released the <b><i>1995-`96 Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i></b>, the first ever comprehensive review of the values presented on every single network evening program.
<dd>MRC analysts reviewed thousands of hours of program footage to compile the <i>Family Guide</i>. They looked at all NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox shows as well as the newest offerings from the WB and UPN networks.
<dd>Rather than look at the artistic merits of a show, the guide analyzes it from the standpoint of values. Which shows are offensive for children? Which shows are highly recommended?
<dd>The Guide is presented in an easy to read format.  Every show on network television is presented with a brief "background" section about its themes, and that's followed with a "summary" outlining what is offensive, or what is recommended.
<dd>The guide is presented with a stoplight format. Red lights are given to those programs not recommended for youngsters; yellow lights for those that contain questionable material; and green lights for those that are recommended for children.
<dd>In November, MRC Chairman L. Brent Bozell III and Parents' Television Council Co-Chair-man Shirley Jones held a press conference in Hollywood to officially release the <i>Family Guide</i>. As Ms. Jones put it, "The <i>Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i> [is] a new and vital weapon in the fight for [children's] minds. That it has not been available until now is only testament to our parental impotency, that as of this day and this announcement is no longer acceptable."
<dd>Many others have praised the <i>Family Guide</i> including William Bennett, who described it as "an excellent resource: objective, accurate, easy to use...the Media Research Center has been doing good work for a long time. [The <i>Family Guide</i>] will surely reinforce its reputation."
<dd>We hope to distribute tens of thousands around the country this year. To help pay for this very expensive project, we are offering the <i>Family Guide</i> at a special rate for our members. With this guide in hand you won't have to worry anymore about the poison on prime time television affecting the children.

<center><h2>Festering Foster</h2></center>
<dd><bing>S</big>everal new developments renewed questions about White House actions related to the Travel Office firings and the death of Vince Foster.  But you wouldn't know if from watching network news.  On October 24 the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee released a May 14, 1993 memo from then-White House aide David Watkins in which he said the First Lady told him to replace career Travel Office employees with a private firm partially owned by a friend.  That contradicted statements made by White House officials over the past two years.  The next day, three handwriting experts asserted that Vince Foster's suicide note was a forgery, thereby implicating White House employees in a grand deception.
<dd>With the exception of a brief mention on NBC's <i>Today</i> on October 29 the networks were silent.  <i>Today</i> co-host Jack Ford asked Tim Russert about "new questions raised about the death of Vince Foster" which "curiously didn't get much coverage at all, the idea now that some experts are questioning the legitimacy of that suicide note."

<p>
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b> Welcome to Meet the Media, the fantasy world of objective journalism, where some of the most important media leaders in the land convene to give you the unfettered truth, the expert analysis concerning the important issues of the day. Today we look at the budget crisis. Let me start with you, E.J. If Bill Clinton were to sign the GOP bill, what would happen?</FONT>
<p><b>E.J. Dionne (<i>Washington Post</i>):</b> "I think that with those kinds of cuts in Medicaid, you really could do a lot of damage or at least cause problems for middle class people."
<p><b>Alan Murray (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>):</b> "If enacted it  would largely get the federal government out of the business of helping the poor. It would mean a much smaller government. It would probably mean a balanced budget. But I think the critics are also right that in some important ways it would mean a less humane government."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b> "Wait a moment, Alan, you sound like Dick Gephardt here. The Republican bill includes a spending increase of $2.6 trillion over the next seven years. That's hardly a much smaller government."</FONT>
<p><b>Robert MacNeil (PBS):</b> "Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said the Democratic plan would cut $89 billion over seven years, a third of what the Republicans have proposed to slash."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b> "But that's my point. Politicians like Daschle and Clinton talk about $271 billion in cuts for Medicare but actually, under the GOP plan, spending in 2002 will be $86 billion higher than 1995. That's an increase of 6 percent annually, far more than inflation. It sounds like the Democrats don't have their facts straight, Eleanor."</FONT>
<p><b>Eleanor Clift (<i>Newsweek</i>):</b>  "The Democrats, the big mistake they've made is they ought to have advertisements about deterioration of quality, they ought to show an elderly person in a hospital, bell  ringing for a nurse who doesn't show up. That's where the cutbacks are going to be."
<p><b>Tom Brokaw (NBC):</b> "Are the Republicans most vulnerable here because they want to make these big cuts in Medicare and also give a tax cut, including tax cuts to those people making $100,000 or more?"
<p><b>John Yang (<i>Washington Post</i>):</b> "President Clinton has declared the GOP budget proposals too extreme and threatened a veto unless Republicans agree to scale back their $245 billion tax cut and the massive cuts in health care for the elderly and poor, welfare programs, student loans, and the Earned Income Tax Credit for the working poor."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  "I thought I just explained to you that under the Republicans there are no massive spending cuts proposed! And even with the tax cuts, the Republican plan projects tax revenues to increase by 41percent over the next seven years."</FONT>
<p><b>Dan Rather (CBS):</b>  "Republicans vowed to press for huge cuts in government spending and $245 billion in tax cuts. President Clinton vowed to veto it as too radical and to extreme."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  "Dan, are you listening? Oh, never mind. Let's move on. The political landscape. Who can the Republicans count on for support?"</FONT>
<p><b>Clarence Page (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>):</b> "Most of the KKK has joined the Republican Party."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  "Whoa! You may not like the Republicans, but where did that come from?"</FONT>
<p><b>Michael Gartner (<i>USA Today</i>):</b> "There's more to governing than likability. We learned that from the likable Ronald Reagan, who charmed us with stories as he amassed huge deficits and spent billions on goofy defense plans. No, the record is more important. And Bill Clinton's record is just short of terrific."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b> "Really? Conservatives, particularly the religious right, will tell you he's completely out of step with the cultural revolution sweeping the land. Just look at the outpouring of love for Pope John Paul II when he was here last month."</FONT>
<p><b>Timothy McNulty (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>)</b> "Without naming names or even mentioning the Republican-dominated Congress, the Pope seemed to admonish the supporters of propose laws to restrict immigration and dismantle many of the nation's programs for the poor. In doing so, he appeared to echo many of Presidents Clinton's warnings."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  "OK, so it's resolved: the Pope's a Democrat. We've only got a few seconds left. Last question to Cokie: Is there a bias in the media's coverage of the budget debate?"</FONT>
<p><b>Cokie Roberts (ABC):</b>  "I think there is a bias in favor of spending money, but I don't think it's liberal versus conservative, but a bias in favor of government programs and spending  money, even if there is not money there to spend and even if you're heaping debt on the next generation."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  And that's the last word. A final programming note for our audience. I, of course, am a fictional creation. My guests are not, and neither is every single quote attributed to them. Have a good day.</FONT>

<center><h2>Prime Time's Missing Mangers</h2></center>
<dd><big>H</big>ave you noticed what's passing for holiday fare on prime time television these days?
<dd>Sure, the networks air special Christmas episodes of their shows, but how many actually deal with Christmas?
<dd>Here at the Media Research Center, our Entertainment Division decided to take a closer look at the content of the networks' holiday offerings.
<dd>In our review of 1994 prime time holiday-themed shows, we found that some contained secularized statements of religious principles, but only a few dealt with the Biblical significance of Christmas, or touched on Scripture at all.
<dd>Unfortunately, those same networks did manage to crank out a good deal of tastelessness and religion-bashing for airing during the Christmas season.
<dd>ABC's <ii>Roseanne</i> was the top offender both in 1994 and 1995. How difficult would it have been to offer one, just one episode that contained family values, that celebrated the Christmas spirit? Surely out of respect for the holiest seasons, Roseanne would tone down her assault on traditional values.
<p>
<center><i><font size=+1>Unfortunately, those same networks did manage to crank out a good <br>deal of tastelessness and religion-bashing for airing during the <br>Christmas season.</font></i></center>
<p>
<dd>But if you believe that you don't  know Roseanne. This is an actress who enjoys not just assaulting, but insulting family values. And she saves her best for Christmas.
<dd>Her 1994 episode concerned her son's erections at inopportune times, such as while standing at the chalkboard during class. The show ended with Roseanne reciting slang terms for erections: "pitching a trouser tent," "standing up for democracy," and so on. In 1995 she was even worse. So offensive was her December 12 episode that ABC moved the show from its usual 8:00 time slot to 9:30.
<dd>It centered on the wedding of Roseanne's boss Leon to Scott. Yes, a gay marriage, in the middle of the most family-oriented time of the year.
<dd>Not surprising that lewd "humor" pervaded the episode. When Scott, alluding to their upcoming honeymoon, suggested to Leon, "Next week, we could be snorkeling in the nude," Roseanne quipped, "Snorkeling, huh? Well, I guess you can learn a new word for it every day." Just before the wedding, Scott said to Leon, "I love you in a way that is mystical, eternal and illegal in twenty states." And after a minister performed the ceremony, they kissed. Merry Christmas from ABC Television Entertainment.
<dd>There was, however, one holiday program worth looking out for. A syndicated special entitled, <b><i>Red Boots for Christmas</i></b>, is helping to disseminate the true message of the season. 
<dd>The animated half-hour is based on a German folk tale which tells of a grouchy shoemaker who learns that the essence of Christmas is not wrapped presents under a tree, but rather God's gift to humanity: a Savior. 
<dd>Your support  of our enter-tainment division enables us to find new ways to expose how much Hollywood's leftist views differ from those people in Middle America.

<center><h2> Letter from the Chairman</h2></center>
<dd><big>A</big>fter the 1994 elections I predicted we would see the most outrageous performance ever from the leftist "news" media. Unfortunately I was right -- and it was even worse than I feared. They have turned public support against conservatives. 
<dd>Our goal in 1996 is to neutralize their impact    -- to convince the public not to believe the propaganda being pushed by the media. Early this year we will announce, at a national press conference, our <b><i>Tell the Truth!</i></b> campaign. We will demand that the national media begin -- begin -- to cover the political landscape fairly.
<dd> The <i>Tell the Truth!</i> campaign will start with the formal release of <b><i>Pattern of Deception: Bill Clinton and the National Media</i></b>. It's a devastating, systematic review of how the media have  promoted Bill Clinton from 1991 through 1995. 
<dd>Just as our first book, And That's the Way It Isn't, gave the MRC its credibility initially, this book will give credibility to our national campaign since the findings are explosive and irrefutable.
<dd>The <i>Tell the Truth!</i> <b>Blast Fax Campaign</b> will combine two of the most successful political techniques undertaken in recent years. In 1992 the Clinton campaign was absolutely ingenious with its rapid response teams. James Carville and Co. were everywhere in the national media responding to anything and everything the Republicans had to say on a moment's notice.
<dd>In 1993 Bill Kristol had a crushing impact on the national health care debate by identifying the top public policy leaders in the country and releasing a regular series of impactful fax reports. He was able to change the entire dynamic of the debate along lines of conservatives' concerns.
The <i>Tell the Truth!</i> Blast Fax Campaign will combine both techniques. We are putting together a list of approximately 1,500 top public policy leaders -- with their fax numbers in order to reach them on a regular basis with our blast fax campaign. 
<dd>When there are developments of outrageous media propaganda (which will happen on a regular basis) we will be shooting out blast faxes around the country to put the press on the defensive immediately. 
<dd>In 1996, teams of <i>Tell the Truth!</i> analysts will be in both parties' convention cities. There we will set up offices and publish a daily report exposing everything the press is doing to slant convention coverage. And by making an issue of convention coverage well in advance, we can neutralize the press if they intend to do in 1996 what they did to conservatives in 1992.
<dd>There will be a flurry of activity by us through the mainstream press.  I will continue to do my twice-weekly syndicated column as well as my weekly television commentary on the TCI television network, and will be writing a series of guest editorials on the subject for major publications like the <i>Wall Street Journal, National Review</i>, and <i>USA Today</i>.
<dd>As for our plans to neutralize the media during the presidential elections, we've got our bases covered. These plans are very expensive, however. So, we will be counting on your continued support throughout this very important election year, and I hope I can count on you.

<center><h2>The Bad and the Biased</h2>
<h3>The Best Notable Quotables of 1995</h3></center>
<h3>For a sampling of some of the awards, the envelope, please:</h3>
<p>
<dd><big>I</big>t has become a tradition at the Media Research Center to present an annual awards issue -- <b><i>The Best Notable Quotables of 1995 </i></b>-- to highlight the year's worst reporting. Each year dozens of conservative writers and talk show hosts gather together to "honor" those responsible for the most irresponsible comments.  
<dd><i>The Best Notable Quotables</i> is the MRC's most popular publication. It is reproduced in papers, the topic of conversation on radio and television talk shows across the country. 
<dd>So how do the media react to our awards?
It's not surprising that the few conservatives in the press are thrilled with our findings and use them for their own ammunition against the liberal media.
<dd><i>National Review</i> ran an excerpt from the <i>Best of Notable Quotables of 1995</i> in December. 
<dd>Mike Rosen, talk show host and columnist, ran excerpts from the <i>Best of Notable Quotables</i> recently in his column.
<dd>Ray Archer, editorial writer for <i>The Arizona Republic</i>, ran quotes from the <i>Best Notable Quotables</i>, and said this of our examples of the liberal media: "There's no dearth of venom spewed by those who typically tout the liberal line."
<dd>Jeff Jacoby, columnist for <i>The Boston Globe</i>, used an excerpt from the <i>Best of Notable Quotables</i> to prove his point in his column entitled, "How the right is demonized."
<dd>The Minneapolis <i>Star Tribune</i> ran a story on January 1 showing both sides of the media bias issue.  It's funny how the <i>Tribune</i> used all empirical, hard evidence from the <i>Best Notable Quotables of 1995</i> to back up our side, yet when it came to presenting Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting's -- FAIR, an organization which alleges <i>conservative</i> media bias -- position, the Tribune printed an opinion column from a FAIR employee, without, as usual, any evidence.
<dd>Not every story based on the <i>Best of Notable Quotables</i> was positive. 
<dd>Of course, we don't expect the "journalists" who win these awards to be happy that we've exposed their biases. 
<dd>Take Clarence Page, columnist and winner of <i>Notable Quotables'</i> year-end Award for Hypocritical Hate Mongering (for his claim that "most of the KKK ha[ve] joined the Republican Party"). He targeted the MRC and the Best Notable Quotables as the topic of a recent column which ran in the <i>Chicago Tribune.</i> 
<dd>He couldn't understand why anyone would take offense to his remark, and cited as evidence that membership in groups like the KKK had gone down during the `80s -- meaning that they were joining the Republican Party.  (How do you think liberals like Page would react if a conservative were to point out that membership in the Communist Party USA had declined in the `80s and that this meant that Communists were now supporting the Democratic Party?) 
<dd>For good measure, the peace-loving Mr. Page concluded his piece by calling supporters of the MRC -- "brownshirts."
<dd>For a full listing of the outlets which have carried our research recently, please turn to page <p>
<center><h3>We'll Decide Who's a Mean-Spirited Republican Award...</h3></center>
<p>
<dd>"The Republican  jihad against the poor, the young, and the helpless rolls on. So far no legislative assault has been too cruel, no budget cut too loathsome for the party that took control of Congress at the beginning of the year and  has spent all its time since then stomping on the last dying embers of idealism and compassion in government."
<p>
<i>--New York Times</i> columnist and former NBC reporter Bob Herbert.
<p>
<center><h3>But It's Okay for Us to Hate Them Award (for Hypocritical Hatemongering)</h3></center>
<p>
<dd>"Most of the KKK has joined the Republican Party. They don't have to be there."
<p>
-- <i>Chicago Tribune</i>'s Clarence Page, commenting on the Million Man March. Page has now written a nationally syndicated column attacking the MRC and <b>defending</b> that comment.
<p>
<center><h3>Damn Those Conservatives Award</h3></center>
<dd>"The scariest of all hobgoblins may be a fellow African American, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. In the four years since George Bush chose him to fill the 'black seat' vacated by Thurgood Marshall, Thomas has emerged as the high court's most aggressive advocate of rolling back the gains Marshall fought so hard for. The maddening irony is that Thomas owes his seat to precisely the kind of racial preference he goes to such lengths to excoriate."
<p>
-- <i>Time's</i> Jack E. White.
<p>
<center><h3> Republicans Make Us Sick Award</h3></center>
<dd>"Next week on ABC's <i>World News Tonight</i>, a series of reports on our environment which will tell you precisely what the new Congress has in mind: the most frontal assault on the environment in 25 years. Is this what the country wants?"
<p>
-- a Peter Jennings promotional spot.
<p>
<center><h3>Americans with Mathematical Disabilities Award (for Calling Hikes a Cut)</h3></center>
<dd>"House Republicans denied any impropriety when they approved federal budget reductions of $17 billion and outlined $190 billion more, slashing programs that largely benefit women, children, and the poor, to pay for that 'pouting sex kitten' mistress of their dreams -- tax cuts."
<p>
 -- U.S. News "reporter" Gerald Parshall giving the public "facts."
<p>
<center><h3>The Politics of Meaninglessness Award (for the Silliest Analysis)</h3></center>
"But aren't most medical procedures, when you describe them in detail, pretty disgusting? Isn't, for example, the production of veal, when you describe it in detail, and how people eat meat, when they crunch down on the flesh of living beings, formerly living beings, with their teeth. Isn't that pretty gruesome, too?"
<p>
-- PBS' <i>To the Contrary</i> host Bonnie Erbe, equating gruesome skull-crushing partial-birth abortions to...eating veal. <p>

<center><h3>The Dumbest Quote of the Year</h3></center>
"I think he ought to be worried about what's going on in the Good Lord's mind, because if there is retributive justice, he'll get AIDS from a transfusion, or one of his grandchildren will get it."
<p>
-- NPR's Nina Totenberg, reacting to Senator Jesse Helms' inquiry about AIDS getting more funding than cancer or heart disease.

<center><h2>New Horizons for the Entertainment Division</h2></center>
<dd><big>1</big>995 was a year of change for the MRC's 
Entertainment Division, changes which will greatly raise our profile and increase our influence in the American culture war. 
<dd>Our new mission was in large part inspired by prime time television's new agenda. In the late 1980s and early '90s, many shows were politically themed. Whether it was <i>L.A. Law</i> trashing Operation Desert Storm, <i>thirtysomething</i> promoting abortion, or <i>Designing Women</i> crusading for most every liberal cause under the sun, the small screen seemed at times to overflow with political advocacy. 
<dd>Of late, though, there has been much less explicit political content on entertainment television. 
That's the good news. 
<dd>Instead of politics, prime time is now emphasizing values, but -- here's the bad news -- Hollywood is now as hostile to traditional morality as it ever was to Ronald Reagan and Dan Quayle.
<dd>Tune in pretty much any time -- even during the so-called "family hour," between 8 and 9 p.m. -- and you'll see this for yourself. Popular series such as <i>Friends and Seinfeld</i> promote premarital sex. Obscenities are frequent on such shows as <i>NYPD Blue</i> and <i>Law & Order</i>. Parental authority is ridiculed on the likes of The Simpsons and Married...With Children. Worst of all, what was once the family hour (8-9 p.m. EST) is now reserved for many of the most offensive programs.
<dd>Yes, when it comes to what Hollywood is teaching our children, the battles are now over values, not politics. 
<dd>To put ourselves on the front lines, last year we established the Parents' Television Council, whose task is to promote responsible prime time programming by working directly with the entertainment industry.
<dd>Though the PTC is headquartered in southern California, its research ammunition will come from the MRC's main office near Washington. In order to focus more of our resources directly on the West Coast, we have decided to discontinue the publication of TV, etc., the Entertainment Division's monthly newsletter. 
<dd>Under the new plan, some of the Entertainment Division's research and analysis will be issued in monographs like the <i>Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i>; and some of it will emerge as MRC Special Reports, which will examine quantitatively the values promoted by prime time television. 
<dd>An example of the latter is our soon-to-be- released study of sexual content and vulgar language which has become a growing trend for the family hour. Yes, it seems that Hollywood is going out of its way once again to insult the traditional American family by airing material unsuited to children at an hour which in past years was set aside for family viewing. Our goal is to inform parents of these practices and through them to incite change in the entertainment industry.
<dd>We're confident that our revised approach will result in a product that will reach and enlighten an ever growing audience, particularly the parents most concerned about the poisonous values of the entertainment community.

<center><h2>PTC's <i>Family Guide</i> Makes a Splash</h2></center>
<dd><big>T</big>he Parents' Television 
   Council (PTC) is a special project of the Media Research Center. The PTC's 1995-'96 <b><i>Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i></b>, the only publication written specifically to help parents determine appropriate television programming, has received national attention since its release in late November.
<dd>The Guide was unveiled at a Hollywood press conference featuring MRC chairman L. Brent Bozell III and actress <b>Shirley Jones</b>, Honorary Co-Chair of the PTC.
<dd>And, as if all that weren't enough, the Guide has at least one fan on Capitol Hill. Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) was so impressed with the Guide that he plans to give a copy to each member of the House and has invited Brent Bozell to speak to Congress about the "influence of television on our culture" at a  "Members only" breakfast.
<dd>The PTC, Smith said, "provides Americans who want to see positive values instilled in children with an invaluable tool. The <i>Family Guide</i>...is the best summary of the values reflected in current prime time television programs that I've seen." 
<dd>Thousands of copies of the Guide now have been distributed, and its editor, Sandra L. Crawford, has conducted promotional interviews with such newspapers as the Detroit Free Press and The Washington Times as well as with such electronic outlets as the Newstalk TV cable network. 
<dd>The first television ad for the Guide aired in the Oklahoma City market.

<center><h2>FEMI Report Piques Media Interest</h2></center>
<dd><big>D</big>oes the profit motive determine what network executives put on prime time television, or is it their political ideology? 
<dd>Last summer, <b>MediaNomics</b>, the Free Enterprise & Media Institute's (a division of the MRC) newsletter, reported a strange phenomenon. 
<dd>The television networks, we reported, continue to produce prime time shows with extreme, anti-business environmental themes. It doesn't matter that such shows consistently get poor ratings. The anti-business, environmental extremism of television writers, producers, and executives forces the shows on the air.
<dd>The <i>MediaNomics</i> story caught the eye of <i>USA Today</i> magazine's editorial staff. They asked MediaNomics Editor Tim Lamer to expand the article into a story for an upcoming issue of the publication. In his report, Lamer shows how TV shows with environmental themes, such as the recently canceled seaQuest 2032 and the movie The Fire Next Time, garnered extremely poor ratings. Both took gratuitous slaps at business.
<dd>On the futuristic sci-fi show seaQuest, for example, ruthless businessman Larry Deon creates havoc for the world. He breaks off a chunk "the size of New England" from a polar icecap. He wants to flood the Middle East and create a market for his fresh water supply. (Does any of this sound the slightest bit plausible?)Viewers learn from Deon's opponent, Wolenczak, that "Lawrence Deon is a privateer, and his companies are turning the world's water supplies into sewage." Viewers also learn from another of Deon's opponents that "the man's been a grandstander since he sold IBM off in a yard sale when he was 23."
<dd>Deon also engages in piracy and tries to sabotage the Omni-Pacific, a transcontinental underwater railroad -- because it will compete with his airlines, don't you know? The government is afraid to try to stop Deon. One politician asks the crew of seaQuest: "So what are we sup-posed to do, embarrass him in front of the whole world? The last time we did that, he tripled the price of steel and nearly bankrupted the auto industry." 
<dd>America, meet the free enterprise system -- Hollywood style.
<dd>Lamer also points out that this business-bashing is not new to entertainment television. 
A 1992 FEMI study showed that business owners committed 43 percent of all crimes on television and 36 percent of all murders, far more than any other group, including politicians, lawyers -- even mobsters. All this from an industry that purports to "reflect reality."
<dd>FEMI, both through its newsletter and through respected national publications, continues to hold the networks accountable for their attacks on businessmen, society's innovators and job creators.

<center><h2><big>MRC</big> Board of Trustees Meeting</h2></center>
<dd>Each year the Media Research Center invites its Board of Trustees to Washington, D.C. to help chart  the future for the organization. It gives us a great opportunity to get input from some of the people who make our work possible through their donations. The Board met in Washington, D.C. on December 5 to formally review the MRC's work.
We think it's important to give MRC Members the same kind of information, so here are some highlights from the meeting:
<dd>MRC Chairman L. Brent Bozell III informed the Trustees of the exciting new plans for its divisions and special projects in 1996 -- the Entertainment Division's new focus on family values and the Free Enterprise and Media Institute's joint projects with other conservative organizations -- also the News Division's plans to confront the leftist media during the upcoming presidential campaign with our <I><b>Tell the Truth!</b></i>  Campaign.
<dd>Among the dignitaries and special guests, Representative J.C. Watts, Jr. (R-Okla) addressed the Trustees. He said of the media: "When it comes to liberals and their lapdog media -- they can lie louder. They are shameless." The Oklahoma Congressman continued, "I have been amazed at how people will go to the well of the House or Senate and spew forth lie after lie and scare our citizens with lies. I have watched in horror as Katie Couric has treated the Speaker of the House [Newt Gingrich] or the Majority Leader [Dick Armey] like criminals for wanting to do the right thing. They can lie louder, but we can tell the truth longer."
<dd>He continued by congratulating the MRC on the opening of the Parents' Television Council in Hollywood. Rep. Watts also reinforced the fact that family values in the entertainment industry are not only entertaining, they are very good business. 
<dd>Syndicated columnist and CNN talk show host Robert Novak also spoke at our Board of Trustees function. Pointing out the simple fact that the majority of journalists are liberal, Novak outlined eight statements that  most members of the press would support:
<ol>
<li>The Republican budget will slash spending for women, children, and the poor.
<li>The U.S. has a global role to protect human rights wherever possible.
<li>Missile defense is a waste of money.
<li>A major purpose of government is income redistribution.
<li>Affirmative action programs are absolutely essential.
<li>The federal government alone can do much better than the states.
<li>Term limits are a bad idea.
<li>America is undertaxed.
<dd>Novak  proceeded by explaining that it's easy to see why the media are biased when you have a majority of journalists who agree with these points.
<dd>Some other special guests who attended the meeting included General Alexander Haig; Ed Capano, Publisher of <i>National Review</i>; Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe; and Arianna Huffington, MRC Trustee and Senior Fellow at the Progress and Freedom Foundation.

<center><h2>Letter from the Chairman</h2></center>
Dear MRC Member,
<p>
<dd><big>I</big>t was early one evening and I was sitting with my young daughter, watching what I thought was a perfectly wholesome show on television. To my surprise and horror, the two main characters on this particular program began having an explicitly sexual conversation. 
<dd>Awkwardly I tried to draw my daughter's attention away from the lewd material coming from the television.
<dd>It's a scene repeated in homes all over America every night. The pollution on the airwaves -- even during the so-called "family hour" -- is out of control.
<dd>Like it or not, studies show that children admire and imitate their favorite celebrities more so than their parents, teachers, or religious leaders. 
<dd>And when surveys also show that by the time the average child graduates from high school he or she will have spent more time in front of a television than in the classroom, who is the teacher in society today?  
<dd>That is why the Media Research Center's Entertainment Division is taking giant steps to make television safe for children again.
<dd>For years Hollywood has been pushing the envelope on sexual themes and rough language. Now the networks have almost completely abandoned what was once the "family hour."  Shows still aimed at children contain some very adult-oriented -- and in some cases, highly offensive -- subject matter.
<dd>In February we released our study, <b><i>A Vanishing Haven: The Decline of the Family Hour</b></i>, and have made the networks' irresponsible programming the subject of a national discussion. 
<dd>We've launched a crusade which has gained support from both conservatives like Rep. Lamar Smith (R.-Tex.) and liberals like Senator Joe Lieberman (D.-Conn.) -- both of whom joined me at a national press conference to release this study on the "family" hour.
<dd>Last month I met with network executives in California. John Matoian (President of the Fox Entertainment Group) and had a very productive conversation about the state of prime time. The Senior Vice President of Programming for the Disney Channel, Bruce Rider, reaffirmed his network's strong commitment to family programming. Warner Brothers' Jamie Kellner told me that maintaining family-friendly programming standards was not only good for young viewers but very good for business -- and would be the cornerstone for this new network.
<dd>So there are good signs  that things are moving in our direction. But now is the time to work, and push, like never before. In these pages you'll get more information on our national campaign, all made possible because of your support.
Sincerely,
<p>
L. Brent Bozell III

<center><h2>Family Hour Findings</h2></center>
<dd><big>P</big>rime time television's traditional family hour -- 8 to 9 p.m. Eastern and Pacific, 7-8 Central and Mountain -- traditionally has been home to scores of wholesome series, including <i>Little House on the Prairie, Happy Days, The Cosby Show</i>, and <i>Full House. </i>
<dd>Not anymore.
<dd>The "family hour" is now dominated by adult-oriented shows like <i>Friends</i> and <i>Mel-rose Place</i>, with sexual content and obscen-ities prevalent across the dial. To document how pervasive the problem has become, the Media Research Center's Entertainment Division studied a month's worth of "family hour" shows. On February 8 we released <i><b>A Vanishing Haven: The Decline of the Family Hour</b></i> and opened up a new front in the American cultural war.
<dd>Our study found that certain words and expressions that as recently as the early 1990s were rarely heard on TV -- even late at night -- are now common between 8 and 9. "Kiss my ass," "bastard," and "bitch," among other vulgarisms, are now acceptable in the "family hour."
<dd>Of the networks, NBC easily won the foul-language award. It aired more than twice as many obscenities per hour -- 1.26 -- as any other network. Fox, ABC, and CBS turned in virtually identical per-formances, with each averaging just over one curse word for every two hours of 8-9 programming. The series with the most swearing was NBC's Mad About You, with seven obscenities; the same network's <i>JAG</i> followed with six. 
<dd>Depictions of sexual behavior were just as squalid. The former "family hour" constantly portrays premarital sex as frequent and permissible; in fact, during the study period, depictions of extramarital or premarital sex outnumbered those of sex within marriage by an 8-1 ratio.
<dd>Fox led the network standings with the most sexual treatments per hour, but the other networks were close behind. NBC's <i>Friends</i>, Fox's <i>Melrose Place</i> and <i>Martin,</i> CBS's <i>Cybill</i> and <i>Almost Perfect</i>, and ABC's <i>Ellen</i> and <i>The Drew Carey Show</i> are just some examples of shows with typically raunchy portrayals of sex.
<dd>A Vanishing Haven has gained the support of from both the left and the right. Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) joined Brent Bozell at the Washington, D.C. press conference where the MRC introduced the study. 
<dd>After summarizing the study findings for reporters, Bozell discussed a letter sent to the entertainment heads of the television networks calling on them to air only "wholesome, family-oriented programming" between 8 and 9. Signers of the letter were Bozell, Lieberman, and Smith, and six other Congressional leaders: Senators Dan Coats (R-Ind.), Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.), and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.) and Representatives: Tom DeLay (R-Tex.), Steve Largent (R-Okla.), and J.C. Watts (R-Okla.)
<dd>"The bulk of TV programming has rapidly grown ruder, cruder, and lewder over the past few years," Sen. Lieberman remarked on the state of network programming standards. "I'm glad to join with the Media Research Center today to call upon the networks to reestablish the family hour...Like any other parent, I don't think it's too much to ask to have one hour [of TV] a night that's junk-free."
<dd>"Many TV shows aired during what should be [the] family hour are corrupting the morals and corroding the minds of a generation of Americans," Rep. Smith stated. "We hope TV producers will live up to their public trust and take their responsibility seriously."  
<dd>Not only did the study garner bipartisan support, it also attracted the attention of the national media. Even they can't disagree that television's programming standards have been heading steadily down- hill. 
<dd>The press conference generated massive coverage. Most networks covered the event; and stories appeared in <i>USA Today</i>, the <i>New York Post</i>, the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, and the <i>Washington Times</i>. The study also was cited by numerous radio talk show hosts including, Rush Limbaugh and Paul Harvey. 
<dd>The debate is in high gear. Rupert Murdoch of Fox Television has now announced his network will institute a ratings system to monitor sexual content and violence on his shows. In the <i>Washington Post</i>, Bozell called this "a good first step," and added: "This is the man most responsible for pollution on the airwaves. Now he's saying he'll rate his pollution instead of doing what he should do. What he should do is get it off the air."

<center><h2>MRC Stamp of Approval</h2></center>
<dd><big>P</big>amela K. Long, the creator and executive producer of the new ABC family drama, <b><i>Second Noah</i></b>, recently met with Sandra L. Crawford, the Media Research Center's Entertainment Division Director, to discuss the series and ask for the MRC's support; and <i>Noah</i> deserves our.
<dd>Filmed at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, <i>Second Noah</i> chronicles the hectic lives of Noah and Jesse Beckett. Noah (Daniel Hugh Kelly) is a former basketball coach and a best-selling novelist, while Jesse (Betsy Brantley) is the chief veterinarian at the Tampa Zoo. Mother and father to eight adopted children of various ethnic backgrounds, the Becketts also run an animal rescue operation, taking in abandoned or mistreated ani-mals. With love and compassion, Noah and Jesse face the daily challenges of raising eight children.
<dd><i>Second Noah</i> places great emphasis on personal responsibility and the family unit. The new series is filled with positive messages about honesty, understanding, and love. It respects religion and condemns racism. 
<dd><i>Second Noah</i> is a quality drama designed for family viewing. Since it has a rich and complex cast of characters to provide limitless possibilities for new stories, we hope <i>Second Noah</i> will be around to offer wholesome family entertainment for a long time to come.
<dd>The series airs on ABC, Monday nights at 8 p.m. EST.
<dd>If you'd like to learn which shows are family-friendly and which aren't, get the 1995-'96 Family Guide to Prime Time Television. Ordering information is provided on page 8.

<center><h2>CBS's Goldberg: Media are biased </h2></center>
<dd><big>V</big>indication is sweet. For years the Media Research Center has been documenting the liberal bias of the media, often provoking hostile denials by journalists. But now someone has joined our efforts -- and the support comes from a most welcomed quarter.
<dd>In a stunning <i>Wall Street Journal</i> column, CBS News correspondent Bernard Goldberg wrote that "the old argument that the networks and other 'media elites' have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore." 
<dd>What prompted Goldberg to write the February 13 article was a <i>CBS Evening News</i> segment about the flat tax by Goldberg's colleague Eric Engberg. Engberg used such loaded words as "elixir" and "scheme" to describe the flat tax, "conjuring up images of Doctor Feelgood selling worthless junk out of the back of his wagon," according to Goldberg.
<dd>Goldberg recounted how Engberg spent much of the story saying a flat tax would cause "hideous deficits" without mentioning the role of spending in recent deficit growth. Goldberg also pointed out how Engberg used only a liberal economist for his story, and didn't even label him as liberal, a privilege never granted to conservatives. Goldberg also revealed the networks' dirty little secret: "Part of the problem is that most reporters and editors -- television and print... don't know a capital gain from a mutual fund. This, as much as bias, in some cases leads to the kind of reporting we see on the flat tax and a lot of other economic issues."
<dd>With his temper, Engberg himself probably required several buckets of ice to cool down before pronouncing to the press: "I've never regarded myself as an ideological warrior of any kind."
<dd>And Dan Rather supported Engberg by declaring: "His hallmarks have always been fairness and accuracy."
<dd>Really? See for yourself if these Engberg reports strike you as "hallmarks of fairness and accuracy":
<dd>October 2, 1994, on Newt Gingrich: "From the start, modesty was not his style. Rejecting the House's gentlemanly ways, he waged such constant guerrilla war against the Democrats he was attacked for McCarthyism...the family values candidate who divorced his ailing first wife, the avowed enemy of dirty politics who bounced 22 checks at the House Bank and runs a big-dollar political action committee that won't disclose its contributors." He also called Gingrich "bombastic and ruthless."
<dd>August 28, 1993 <i>Face the Nation</i> question to conservative Rep. Gary Franks: "I know that many of the ideas that you advocate, self-help, up-by-the-bootstraps-type arguments, that has been used for years as an excuse for the government to do nothing, hasn't it?"  
<dd>October 5, 1992: "Feel-bad ads trying to drag down Bill Clinton are regarded as the only hope. In a multi-million dollar assault, Clinton is being portrayed as a duplicitous blobhead who governs a Hee Haw backwater where only the taxes soar. The ads are cleverly worded to suggest Clinton means more taxes." 
<dd>After exposing the Bush ad for relying on "assumptions" that Clinton would raise taxes, Engberg then asked Steven Colford of <i>Advertising Age</i> to describe "the stacking up of assumptions like this, there's a word we use for that." Replied Colford: "I think it's 'lying.'"
<dd>June 7, 1989, on China's Tiananmen Square massacre: "Will the military leaders there be embarrassed by this? Will this be something like Kent State was for our military?"
<dd>April 6, 1989: Engberg charged that in 1985, George Bush "carried promises of U.S. aid to the military dictatorship of Honduras." (Not true: CBS showed video of Bush hugging <i>democratically elected</i> civilian leader Roberto Suazo Cordova.)
<dd>Goldberg's friends told the <i>Washington Post</i>. "He has complained to CBS management about a liberal tilt for several years and has been consistently ignored." 
<dd>Is CBS's reaction to his published charges -- denial and arrogance -- any surprise?

<center><h2>Foreign journalists learn about MRC</h2></center>
<dd><big>I</big>s media bias just a problem in America? It may surprise you to learn that the Media Research Center's mission to encourage responsible journalism doesn't stop at the country's borders. The National Forum Foundation and Delphi International have made the MRC a popular stop for international journalists. The two groups, which arrange tours of the United States for foreign professionals, now regularly bring their guests to the MRC headquarters to learn more about what we do and the unique role we play in American politics.
<dd>Just in the past few months, reporters and journalism professors from Algeria, Austria, Gabon, Kyrgystan, Nepal, Pakistan, Poland, and Russia have visited the MRC. Tim Lamer, Director  of the MRC's Free Enterprise & Media Institute, briefs them on the biases of the American media, what the MRC does to combat those biases, and the crucial role of strong watchdog organizations in a democratic society.
<dd>The questions they ask are wide-ranging and fascinating because they reflect the authoritarian backgrounds of their countries. "Does the MRC advocate censorship?" (No, we assure them, but we believe a free press does not mean freedom from criticism.) "Is the MRC funded by the government?" (No, we're funded by like-minded Americans who recognize the need for a check on the media's power, and who want the media held accountable for what they say and write.) In fact, we inform them, the press cannot truly be free unless both it and its critics are not entangled by government regulations and financing.
<dd>Some have expressed interest in someday starting an organization like the MRC in their own countries. Some have remained, working out of our office in order to learn the trade. Many of them find they can use our research for their work back home. All of them come away with a better understanding of the American media and the American political scene.
<dd>By supporting the MRC, you aren't just making the American media more responsible, you're being a positive influence on the global media.

<center><h2>FEMI editor and the welfare debate</center></h2>
<dd><big>W</big>hile combating liberal media bias is the main mission of the Media Research Center, our staffers sometimes take on other issues as well. Example: Tim Lamer of the MRC's Free Enterprise & Media Institute recently wrote an article about welfare reform for <i><b>The Weekly Standard</b></i>, one of the conservative movement's premier magazines.
<dd>At issue was an amendment to the welfare reform bill offered by Republican Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri. The amendment would have allowed government to contract with religious charities to provide welfare services to the poor, as long as they didn't use the money to proselytize. Lamer argued that the amendment was a mistake on three grounds.
<dd>First, the reason religious charities do well is because they proselytize. If they're not allowed to do that, they won't be any more effective than government or other charities. Second, taxpayers of all religious stripes  -- whether Roman Catholic, Evangelical Protestant, Jewish, Mormon, or whatever -- shouldn't be forced by the government into supporting faiths with which they disagree. Third, conservatives shouldn't be turning more charities into clients of the welfare state unless we want even more groups lobbying for big government.
<dd>Lamer's article ran in the January 15 issue of <b><i>The Weekly Standard</i></b>.

<center><h2>Commentary</h2>
<h3>L. BRENT BOZELL III</h3>
<h3>Franken Privileges: Cheap-Shot Satire</h3></center>
<dd><big>F</big>ew doubt that Al Franken's a genuinely funny guy. He wrote for <i>Saturday Night Live</i> during its golden age in the latter half of the 1970s; years later on SNL, he created and realized the character of wispy self-help sage Stuart Smalley and performed a hilarious impression of Sen. Paul Simon. 
<dd>Alas, national recognition for his ability to amuse apparently wasn't en-ough for Franken, who now styles himself a pundit as well. He says his sporadically laugh - provoking bestseller Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations (Delacorte) is a "satire about the breakdown in the civility of public discourse," but on the frequent occasions when his ideology crowds out his wit, he's unquestionably uncivil in his own right.
<dd>Is Franken a humorist seeking to score laughs or a polemicist out to slay the dragons of the right? To be sure, much of what he writes is clearly satirical. Of an exhibit at the never-built Disney's America theme park that was to have simulated what it was like to be a slave, he quips, "All I can say is that it [would have been] a gross distortion of history to have the Un-derground Railroad loop the loop." Not quite Jonathan Swift, but pretty clever. His political humor can carry a punch. But can conservatives take offense at a chapter titled "Pat Buchanan: Nazi Lover" when we've laughed uproariously at Limbaugh's "feminazi" digs? Not really, not if the intent is satire.
<dd>But that's where Franken fails. There's a certain venom in his pen that transforms humor into spite, and spite undisciplined becomes insult. Limbaugh thus becomes "mean," a "bully," and a "liar"; Limbaugh's fans are trashed as "yahoos" and "f---ing morons"; Buchanan's a "racist"; and anyone who thinks Ronald Reagan was the greatest President of this century is a "f---ing idiot." Casting aspersions on these and other con-servative personalities and causes, Franken's acting as a hatchet man -- no more, no less. 
<dd>Franken asserts that his harshness is ironic, that he's "making fun of meanness...by being mean myself." The problem with that argument is that amidst all the invective in his book, there's virtually no indication that he does not really despise his targets, or at least their politics. As far as keeping up with whether or not Franken is kidding at any given moment is concerned, Rush Limbaugh... is basically a 271-page shell game. 
<dd>Naturally, Franken's choice for the best President of the century is...Bill Clinton. "I was trying to write a scathing piece on Clinton," he declares, "and at a certain point it just became impossible...This kind of thing never happened when I was writing the Phil Gramm chapter." Gramm, on the other hand, is a "bastard" and a "big jerk." (But how dependable is Franken's opinion anyway? He's still trying to sell the long-debunked story that Gramm invested in a porn flick.)
<dd>Franken pulls out all the stops in a chapter concerned with 1) skewering Reaganomics and 2) blasting Limbaugh for his defense of same. Regarding said defense, Franken sneers, "These are the rational, carefully constructed, deliberate lies of a man running a gi-ant propaganda factory dedicated to two things: convincing people who were screwed sideways by Reagan-omics that it was actually good for them, and encouraging the people who turned the screws to feel good about themselves...Reaganomics worked. This is the jewel in Rush's crown of bulls--t."
<dd>If there is an economically sophis-ticated anti-Reaganomics case to be made, Franken doesn't make it, re-sorting instead to Richard Gephardt-like class-envy hackwork. As for most Americans getting "screwed side-ways," Franken apparently forgets that real income taxes paid by 90 percent of Americans fell by 10 percent from 1981 to 1987, while real income taxes paid by the richest five percent rose by nearly 43 percent in the same period. Add to that the obvious (seven years of prosperity; two decisive elec-tion victories for Presidential can-didates running on a Reaganomics-centered platform) and you realize why liberals in the entertainment community behave the way they do: Like Oliver Stone and his movies, Franken cannot defend the principles of liberalism -- so he enters the world of make-believe instead. Creative license, we're told.
<dd>Towards the end of that ill-fated chapter, Franken writes, "I think I'm really breaking new ground here. I mean, did you see bar graphs in Jerry Seinfeld's book? In Tim Allen's?" No, and the reason you didn't, obviously, is that Seinfeld and Allen had way too much comedic acumen to even dream of putting in bar graphs in the first place. There's some amusement to be found in Rush Limbaugh... but considered as political analysis, it is       -- in the derisive, non-funny sense -- a joke.

<center><h2>Letter from the Chairman</h2></center>
Dear MRC member,
<p>
<dd>I predicted that the media would have a field day with the GOP primaries, and that's just what happened. I don't know if there's ever been more negative or slanderous coverage of candidates  than what Bob Dole, Pat Buchanan, Steve Forbes and others have been subjected to this year. 
<dd>The media are complaining about how dirty campaigns have become, yet mud-slinging is the only issue they'll cover.  With all their attacks on GOP candidates, the media themselves are ignoring the real issues. 
<dd>A recent study, released by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, found that in campaign coverage "the networks devoted twice as many stories to the horse race (60) as the candidates' policies (30)." And let's not forget how negative the media themselves are. The same study showed reporters' "criticism of the race outnumbered praise by a 20-to-1 margin."
<dd>One blatant example of this was CBS's Eric Engberg's description of Steve Forbes' flat tax proposal as "wacky."  Even more flagrant was Ted Koppel's charge on Nightline that Buchanan is anti-Semitic.
<p>
<blockquote>
<b><font size=+1>Bozell: "If the media distortions continue to go unchecked, we'll be looking at four more years of Clinton running our country." </font></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
<dd>While the media complain about negative campaigns, they are giving less and less time to candidates who are trying to explain their policies. The same study found that the average length of candidates' soundbites was only 7.3 seconds -- shorter than ever. The study also compared the amount of airtime given to GOP candidates (56 minutes) to airtime reporters spent analyzing what the candidates were saying (5 hours, 45 minutes).
<dd>If the media distortions continue to go unchecked, we'll be looking at four more years of Clinton running our country, because they are doing nothing to expose his record.
We <b><i>must</i></b> make the media accountable for their gaps in the truth and distortions of the facts. That is why the Media Research Center has launched a two million dollar campaign to <b>hold the media responsible for their liberally slanted reporting, and force them to begin to "Tell the Truth."</b> Thank you for helping us. 
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>

<center><h2>MRC Welcomes new PTC Director Harry Medved</h2></center>
<dd><big>T</big>he Media Research Center is proud to announce that Harry Medved, the former National Communications Director of the Screen Actors Guild, has assumed his post as the Executive Director of the Parents' Television Council.
<dd>The Los Angeles based Parents' Television Council is a special project of the MRC. The PTC's goal to restore traditional family values to the entertainment industry.
<dd>"It is a privilege to have Harry Medved join the Parents' Television Council as the Executive Director." said MRC Chairman Brent Bozell in a national statement. "He brings a wealth of experience to the PTC.  Harry knows the industry and its people, and he will be a valuable leader in the efforts to restore family-friendly programming."
<dd>Medved's experience in the entertainment industry is indeed extensive. He is the co-founder of the multimedia company Hollywood Interactive, Inc., as well as the co-author of four books on motion picture history.  During his work for the Screen Actors Guild, he was responsible for overseeing all media relations. He has also co-authored four satirical books on the movie industry with his brother, the well known film critic Michael Medved.
<dd>Harry Medved's broad background provides him with the media savvy necessary to insure that the PTC will have an even greater impact on the debate over values in Hollywood. 
<dd>"I consider this a terrific opportunity to improve communications within the industry on these important issues," Medved remarked. "I look forward to working closely with network executives, producers, writers, directors and actors on this project to build bridges with families across the country."
<dd>Here at the MRC, we are confident that our fight for family values is taking a great leap forward with Medved taking the reins of the PTC.  He will be a valuable asset in our struggle to promote responsible programming, making television  safe for America's children.

<center><h2>FEMI Breakfast Forum A Huge Success</h2></center>
<dd>During his run for the Republican presidential nomination, Steve Forbes called for the overhaul of our hopelessly confusing tax system while replacing it with a flat tax. 
<dd>Reporters continuously savaged the flat tax, ignoring arguments supporting tax reform. Journalists called it "wacky" and "a cruel hoax." They said it would cause "hideous deficits." They labeled it an "economic elixir." They suggested it would add $140 billion to the deficit. They called it a tax increase on the poor, a tax increase on the middle class, and nothing but a tax cut for the rich.
<dd>According to many economists, it's none of those things. But you virtually never hear this side of the story in the news media.
<dd>That made the flat tax a perfect topic for a Free Enterprise & Media Institute Breakfast Forum. FEMI (a division of the Media Research Center) Breakfast Forums are held with the intention of bringing together conservative policy makers and journalists to discuss important economic issues, to acquaint journalists with conservative sources (whom they rarely quote) and their ideas.
<dd>The flat tax forum was held March 13 in Washington and included then-Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes and former Congressman Jack Kemp. In his introduction of Mr. Forbes, MRC Chairman Brent Bozell emphasized that the event was not an endorsement of the Forbes candidacy. 
<dd>Mr. Forbes then proceeded to give a comprehensive overview on the history of taxation in America, then followed it with a thorough explanation of his flat tax proposal. Forbes explained how his plan would not increase taxes on anyone, and how it would cut taxes for everyone. He stressed that the only way to reduce the deficit  is to reduce spending, or have the economy grow, both of which a flat tax would accomplish. Forbes argued that because the flat tax would lower interest rates, it would help homeowners. As for complaints from charitable organizations, he showed how, throughout history, tax cuts have always generated increases in charitable giving by making people richer.
<dd>These were arguments that many reporters, trained on the short soundbite, had never heard. Forbes expressed his gratitude to the MRC for giving him this opportunity to go "beyond 30-second, or ten-second, or three-second soundbites, not trying to play gotcha, but trying to gain true understanding. As we say in <i>Forbes</i> magazine, out of Deuteronomy in the Bible, 'With all thy getting, get understanding.' I appreciate, Brent, this opportunity to help that process."
<dd>The FEMI Breakfast Forum was a huge press event. It drew all three broadcast networks, CNN, and C-SPAN. It also drew major print reporters, such as Michael Barone of <i>U.S. News & World Report</i>, Gerald Seib of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and Dan Balz of the <i>Washington Post</i>. 
The forum also garnered stories in the <i>Washington Post, Chicago Tribune</i>, and <i>USA Today</i>, and on CNN's <i>Inside Politics</i>, among many others. The entire FEMI Breakfast Forum was shown on C-SPAN.

<center><h2>MRC Co-Sponsors  CPAC</h2></center>
<dd><big>T</big>he Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), an annual convention held in Washington, D.C., brings together dozens of conservative leaders with thousands of grassroots activists. This year the Media Research Center co-sponsored the 23rd Annual Conservative Political Action Conference. 
<dd>CPAC is host to such groups as the Family Research Council, the Christian Coalition, the Heritage Foundation, and the National Rifle Association.
<dd>It is also a forum for thousands of conservatives from all regions to hear the conservative perspective on the key issues of the day. Noted speakers this year included Bill Bennett, Oliver North, Senator Phil Gramm (R.-Tex.), Congressman Bob Dornan (R.-Calif.),  Steve Forbes, and Alan Keyes.
<dd>The Media Research Center played a major role at CPAC this year. MRC spokesmen met with our members and subscribers at the MRC's CPAC booth where we distributed  a wealth of information. 
<dd>The MRC also hosted an open reception for the CPAC attendees, where our supporters were able to talk with Brent Bozell and other key MRC staff. Bozell also moderated the annual debate between CNN's conservative Bob Novak and ABC's liberal Sam Donaldson. Always one of the highlights of the conference, this debate drew a capacity crowd. 
<dd>It was clear, from so many speakers' presentations as well as the mood of the CPAC attendees, that conservatives are fed up with the pervasive influence of the liberal media and their coverage of politics. 
<dd>It was equally emphatic that the movement sees the MRC as the leader in the fight to expose and neutralize this bias.

<center><h2><i>Time</i> Writer Damns Those Conservatives</h2></center>
<dd><i><blockquote>"I can't tell you how thrilled I am to have been named twice in your December 18 edition featuring the Best Notable Quotables of 1995. To be attacked by a mob of lunatics like your panel of judges is truly an honor. I will cherish it nearly as much as I do the condemnation I received from Louis Farrakhan's followers for criticizing the Million Man March and his recent tour of third world dictatorships. Please select me again!"</i></blockquote>
This is a letter to the Media Research Center from <i>Time</i> magazine's Jack E. White. 
White won the "Damn Those Conservatives Award" in our <i><b>Best Notable Quotables of 1995</b></i> for this quote from his June column:
<dd> "These days Washington seems to be filled with white men who make black people uneasy, like Newt the slasher, Bill the waffler, and Jesse the crank -- Helms that is, not Jackson. But the scariest of all the hobgoblins may well be a fellow African American, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. In the four years since George Bush chose him to fill the 'black seat' left by Thurgood Marshall, Thomas has emerged as the high court's most aggressive advocate of rolling back the gains Marshall fought so hard for. The maddening irony is that Thomas owes his seat to precisely the kind of racial preference he goes to such lengths to excoriate."
<dd>White also made runner-up for the "Embodiment of all Evil Award (for Newt Bashing)" in the <b><i>Best Notable Quotables of 1995</i></b> for this quote:
<dd>"Let's face it: to most African Americans Newt Gingrich is one scary white man...One can only hope Gingrich was sincere in his speech to Congress last week...That could only mean Gingrich is serious about shedding his party's whites-only image. If so, blacks ought to meet him halfway -- if only to temper the impulses of one scary white man."
<dd>Who makes up this "mob of lunatics"? This year the judges for the <b><i>Best Notable Quotables</i></b> included such broadly respected and well known conservatives as CNN's Bob Novak, CNBC's Cal Thomas, and <i>American Spectator</i> Editor R. Emmett Tyrrell; in years past they have been joined by Rush Limbaugh and Charlton Heston.
<dd>Is it any wonder why the public is fed up with the arrogance of the national press?

<h3>Negative Campaigning: Look Who's Talking   The Washington Times</h3></center>
<p>
<dd><big>T</big>he pundits are right.This is the worst year of negative campaigning I've ever seen. These Republican can-didates are being torn apart at the seams. Just sample some of the invective that's being thrown at them on television:
<ol>
<li> Before the campaign really got going, Phil Gramm's campaign was being smeared with a negative TV ad featuring on the screen a New Republic headline labeling Gramm "The Porn Broker" for 18 seconds. When the New Republic's source for the allegation that Gramm had funded a "soft-porn" film in the 1970s repudiated the story, saying "there was no pornography at all," there were no apologies.
<li> Steve Forbes saw his flat tax plan attacked in one campaign commercial as likely to produce "hideous deficits." The ad concluded: "The fact remains the flat tax is a giant, untested theory. One economist suggested before we put it in, we should test it out someplace        -- like Albania." 
<li> The most vicious negative attacks have been aired against Pat Buchanan. One underlined his endorsement by Russian nationalist kook Vladimir Zhirinovsky. 
</ol>
<dd>Another one charged: "It's not that Pat Buchanan today is associated with overtly anti-Semitic or racist acts or statements, but rather that he has  created an image of someone who might be sympathetic to such acts or statements by others." 
<dd>Yet another stooped to attacks on his family, charging his father listened to the anti-Semitic radio show of Father Coughlin, and that his little brothers beat up Jewish kids -- "Christ-killers," they were allegedly called -- in the 1950s.
<p>
<blockquote><b><font size=+1>If they still wish to be the black pot lecturing the kettles on negative campaigning, I have four words for them: Sit down. Shut up.</font></b></blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Yet another ad against Buchanan showed racist nut David Duke at a Buchanan rally, and featured an endorsement from Ku Klux Klansman Daniel Carver. The ad concluded: "A man who says what he means and means what he says and now must fight the embrace of people who think they know exactly what he's talking about."
<dd>As you may already have concluded, these aren't really commercials made by the Republican presidential candidates. Anyone who watches politics knows that were candidates to say these things in their commercials they would be universally scorned -- especially by the press -- for doing so. They are, instead, what the networks themselves have offered us in this campaign. ABC smeared Phil Gramm. CBS bombed the Forbes flat tax. ABC's Ted Koppel and CBS's Bob McNamara hurled bigoted attacks at Buchanan. If we would hound candidates off the hustings for these kinds of attacks, why do we tolerate them from reporters?
<dd>These are the same networks who shake their heads and decry the corrosive negativity of politics. After the recent South Carolina debate, in which the candidates were required to respond to each other's negative ads, the networks all clucked at how unappetizing the prospect was. One wonders if they have considered how unappetizing watching their own programs can be. If they still wish to be the black pot lecturing the kettles on negative campaigning throughout this election year, I have four words for them: Sit down. Shut up. 
<dd>Koppel, for his part, couldn't even leave his attacks at the low level of questioning the ancient antics of the Buchanan children. (This, from  the  man who said of Bill Clinton's draft-dodging thank-you letter: "If we were electing that 23-year-old man, what he said and thought and felt at that time would be germane.") Koppel had help from Time essayist Lance Morrow, who in his magazine likened Buchanan to Joe McCarthy -- "the driving, urgent undershadow of menace." 
<dd>For <i>Nightline</i>, Morrow added that Buchanan's upbringing at the Blessed Sacrament Church and Gonzaga High School was marked by a "reflexive" anti-Semitism of the "they killed Christ" variety. But others who attended high school with Buchanan flatly deny this outrageous charge. You guessed it: <i>Nightline</i> ignored them. 
<dd>Liberal <i>Boston Globe</i> columnist Tom Oliphant has called the liberal media to account on these charges of bigotry against Buchanan, often employing guilt by association: "For liberals to be silent simply because this filth is being directed at a creature of the Right who happens to be on a political roll is intolerable." 
<dd>Already, the media are preparing this story line for the 1996 general election campaign. Bill Clinton, the Great Triangulator, is trying to give the country a better tomorrow, while the Republicans, devoid of vision, have nothing to offer but cheap negative attacks.  
<dd>It's important to declare that negativity has a place in any campaign in defining why one candidate deserves to be elected over his opponent. But let the candidates do that. Decency is also important. It's time the national media attempt to rise to the level of civility these Republican candidates have shown each other.

<center><h2>MRC's Tim Graham Authors Explosive New Book</h2></center>
<dd><big>F</big>rom the Media Research Center's MediaWatch Associate Editor Tim Graham comes a new book entitled <b><i>Pattern of Deception: The Media's Role in the Clinton Presidency.</i></b>
The result of four years of exhaustive research, the book proves beyond a shadow of a doubt how the press has misled the American people by massaging Clinton's image, masking his faults, attacking his opponents and distorting the truth. 
<dd>Using reporters' own words, supplemented by data from the Media Research Center's studies and analyses, <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> not only indicts the media, it <b>convicts</b> them. Starting with the primary campaign in early 1992 and going through to the present, <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> lays bare the undeniable, irrefutable, unmistakable pro-Clinton bias in the national media. 
<dd>The release of <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> officially kicks off the MRC's "Tell the Truth!" campaign to stop the liberal media's shameless promotion of Bill Clinton. We have already distributed over 1,000 books to reporters, columnists, television and radio talk show hosts and producers, as well as to every conservative Member of Congress. We are arming conservatives in the media and public policy with the definitive evidence of how the national press is doing everything in its power to promote Bill Clinton and his left-wing agenda. And we're letting liberals know we conservatives are fighting back.
<dd>Tim Graham is heading up a major television and radio blitz.

<center><h3>A New Poll Rocks the world of Journalism</h3></center>
Dear MRC Member,
<p>
<dd><big>A</big> new poll from the Roper Center and the Freedom Forum has rocked the world of journalism. It proves that Washington-based reporters and editors are even more liberal than we thought. Just look at the numbers: 89 percent voted for Clinton in 1992 (as opposed to 43 percent of the public); only 7 percent voted for Bush; only 4 percent are registered Republicans, while 50 percent are Democrats; only 3 percent think the Contract With America was a serious proposal. And get this: only 2 percent call themselves conservative.
<dd>Remarkably, <b>still</b> reporters are denying a bias when given these numbers! I was asked to debate <i>Newsweek</i>'s Eleanor Clift on CNN's <i>Crossfire</i> recently; both Robert Novak and I listened incredulously as she absolutely denied these numbers were evidence of bias. Rather, she said, it proved how good a job the media are doing, since they are being so tough on Bill Clinton.
<dd>It defies belief. It also explains why our work is so critical to the conservative movement. In the past month we've had a host of new programs:
<ol>
<li>After four years of research, Tim Graham's new book, <b><i>Pattern of Deception: The Media's Role in the Clinton Presidency</b></i>, is now published. It proves how the liberal press worked to elect  Bill Clinton for President in '92, how they've championed his agenda since then, and how they're doing it again in '96.
<li>During Holy Week we released our third annual <b><i>Faith in a Box: Television and Religion 1995</i></b>. By studying over 41,000 network news stories and 1,800 hours of prime time entertainment programs in 1995 we have documented the media's  antagonism toward religious institutions, leaders, and doctrines. It's gratifying to know that some in the press are finally admitting it. "I think there is...a problem with what I call cultural bias on these subjects...religion, abortion, and homosexuality," said <i>Washington Post</i> reporter Howard Kurtz. "I think a lot of it is unconscious, but I think those kinds of subjects, most reporters are probably to the left of the American public and probably don't realize that they're not always giving a full weights of views of people who have a very different take on these matters."
</ol>And then there is the MRC's campaign to bring the "family hour" back to prime time television. (The campaign began with the release of our study, <i><b>A Vanishing Haven: The Decline of the Family Hour</b></i>.) The momentum is growing: over 70 Members of Congress have publicly joined our efforts and signed their names to a full page advertisement that ran in Daily Variety, one of the entertainment industry's leading trade publications.
<dd>All three ventures have something in common: none of these efforts has ever been done before simply because conservatives didn't have the organization or resources to undertake these huge projects. In one month we launched all three of them, and liberals' heads are spinning. They've never been hit like this before, and it explains Bob Novak's statement to me at a reception last week. "They hate you, Brent," he laughed. "They hate you more than any conservative in America!"  Given the company that puts me in, I'm honored.
<dd>Thanks for making all of this possible.
Sincerely,
<p>

<b><font size=+1>-"They hate you, Brent. They hate you more than any conservative in America!"</font></b>

<center><h2>Tell the Truth! Update</center></h2>
<dd><big>T</big>he biggest obstacle for conservatives in every presidential election for the past 30 years is the media's unfair, slanted coverage. This year the MRC has announced we've had enough -- and we aren't going to take anymore. And we're putting our money where our mouth is -- a $2 million Tell the Truth! Campaign to expose the leftist agenda of the media.
<dd>The national campaign is in full gear; the MRC is everywhere in the press right now. 
<dd>Our "Blast Fax" press release campaign is providing conservative radio talk show hosts and columnists with daily ammunition exposing media distortions. Rush Limbaugh, Ollie North, Paul Harvey and a host of others are passing this information on to <b>millions</b> on a daily basis. 
<dd>MRC spokesmen are appearing on numerous television and radio shows every single day. They've appeared on CNN's Crossfire, CBN's the 700 Club, National Public Radio, the Oliver North Show, and literally dozens and dozens of others in just the past few weeks alone.
<dd>We have begun distributing Tim Graham's blockbuster new book Pattern of Deception: The Media's Role in the Clinton Presidency to hundreds of conservatives in the media and public policy. 
<p><font size=+1><blockquote>From now until the election you will find these regular updates in <i>FLASH</i> on what the MRC is doing to expose the media's biased election coverage.</blockquote></font>
<p>
<dd>Since Tim Graham began his media blitz for the book, orders have been flooding our office. We are confident from these early responses to the book that <i>Pattern of Deception</i> will be hugely successful in exposing how the leftist media are openly championing the Clinton Administration. 
<dd>Another aspect of our national "Tell the Truth!" campaign includes distributing hundreds of thousands of bumper stickers, pens, and magnets with the logo, "I DON'T BELIEVE THE LIBERAL NEWS MEDIA!" all over the country.
<dd> If you'd like to show your support for our "Tell the Truth!" campaign with one of the MRC's "I don't believe the liberal news media!" items call us at (800)-MRC-1423, and we'll send these out to you for a shipping and handling fee of $2.
<dd>We will also be opening an office in San Diego -- during the Republican National Convention. This year the media will not get away with their blatant distortions and outright lies against conservatives, as they did at the Houston Convention of '92. 
<dd>These are only a few of our plans. Much, much more is being prepared for our friends in the liberal press this year. Be on the lookout in <i><b>Flash</b></i> in the coming months for more updates on our "Tell the Truth!" campaign.

<a name="religion">
<center><h2>MRC Religion Report Generates National Discussion</h2></center>
<dd><big>S</big>urveys show the United States is one of the most religious countries in the world. Every year since 1952, Gallup polls have found that about 90 percent of Americans claim their faith is important. On the other hand, a 1995 U.S. News & World Report survey of Hollywood executives found that only 44 percent considered religion important. Another study revealed that 86 percent of  journalists seldom or never attend church, and 50 percent don't even believe in God. 
<dd>Does the product from the news and entertainment media reflect society's views? Not only do both the news and entertainment media not care about religion, when they do touch on it, they regularly attack it.
<dd>It's all detailed in the Media Research Center's third annual report: <b><i>Faith in a Box: Television and Religion 1995</i></b>, the most comprehensive study of its kind in history. Here are some of the findings:
<h3>Prime Time Entertainment Television</h3>
In 1995, there were almost 1,800 hours of original entertainment programming on ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, UPN, and WB, but only 287 religious portrayals. Overall, 38 percent of these depictions of religion were positive, and 28 percent were negative -- roughly a 4-to-3 ratio. This near-balance of positive and negative may satisfy secular Hollywood, but it offends tens of millions of Americans who cherish their religious beliefs. 
<dd>If it's a simple expression of faith, 77 percent of the depictions were positive. But the more serious the expression (and the one expressing it) the more negative it became. Religious institutions only received positive representations 31 percent of the time. Only 20 percent of the depictions of the clergy were positive, while a whopping 43 percent were negative! And the laity? Only 11 percent of the depictions of lay religious leaders were positive -- 64 percent were negative! 
<dd>There was a bright side. In 1995 we also had CBS's Touched By an Angel, arguably the most pro-faith show in television history. It's also a bona fide hit, the fastest growing show on their network, and the second fastest growing show on all of television!
<h3>Network News</h3>
<dd>The network news programs virtually ignored religion in 1995. Out of 18,000 evening news stories, religion drew only 249, and out of 26,000 morning news segments, only 224 dealt with matters of faith. For the third year in a row, religion stories again represented only about one percent of the networks' total coverage. 
<dd>The Catholic Church dominated what religion reporting there was, with almost half the evening news stories and 71 percent of the morning segments.  
<dd>In more political terms, the religious right was again portrayed as extreme and damaging to the Republican Party, even though it provided the margin of victory for the GOP in '94. As well, though not a single pro-life incumbent from either party lost that year and dozens of pro-lifers were elected to Congress, the media continued to report that pro-life policies were hurting the GOP. 
<dd>Stories about violence and harassment at abortion clinics drew another 142 stories in 1995. On the other hand, only three stories focused on the violence of abortion itself, or on documented examples of harassment and violence by abortion advocates against pro-lifers.
<dd>That television's treatment of religion has not significantly improved since the MRC's first study two years ago is troubling. The networks wonder why their audience continues to shrink, year after year. When will they begin to understand that their assault on religion is offensive to 90 percent of the public, and maybe, just maybe, might be a factor?  
<dd>Media Research Center Chairman Brent Bozell held a national press conference on April 4 to release <i><b>Faith in a Box: Television and Religion 1995</b></i>. The event was shown live on C-SPAN, and covered by CNN, CBS Radio, ABC Radio, USA Today, the Washington Times, and countless other outlets.
<dd>There has been a tremendous feedback to our work since the press conference aired live on C-SPAN. Viewers across the nation have thanked us for our work on this issue.

<center><h2>MRC's Family Hour Push</h2></center>
<dd><big>I</big>n this election year, with partisan wrangling everywhere, one issue is bringing together Republicans and Democrats: the MRC's campaign to restore positive values on television, particularly during prime time's Family Hour.
<dd>Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Representative Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) each circulated petitions to their colleagues seeking their support. (Sen. Lieberman and Rep. Smith joined Brent Bozell on February 8 at a national press conference calling on Hollywood to voluntarily return to the spirit of the family hour.)
<dd>Thus far over 70 Senators and Representatives have signed an open letter, calling on Hollywood to voluntarily program only family-friendly fare in the first hour of prime time (8-9 p.m. on the coasts, 7-8 p.m. in middle America). The text of the letter was reproduced in a full-page advertisement in the April 30 issue of <i>Daily Variety</i>.
<dd>Perhaps the most eye-catching aspect of the campaign is the support it has drawn from across the ideological spectrum. Conservatives like Senator Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and Representative Bob Dornan (R-Calif.) have joined liberals like Senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Representative Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.) in backing the MRC's effort.  
<dd>Now it's time for us to target the advertising community. A letter is being prepared for the biggest advertisers on prime time television, asking them to join our Family Hour crusade. Watch this space for regular updates.

<center><h3>Unabomber: Really a Swell Guy</h3></center>
<dd>"I can't bring myself to hate the Unabomber. Quite the opposite; I find his story curiously affecting.[The manifesto] tells us what we all know: that American society can be a powerfully compromising, deadening, even saddening force...If Kaczynski proves to be the Unabomber, he is nobody's hero, certainly not mine. The bomber murdered three people, and might well have many more, all by design. Coincidentally, Kaczynski invaded our front pages just before Easter Sunday, mute, pathetic, and manacled before his captors. But maybe he accomplished what the Unabomber set out to do, to make us think about ourselves, and the society that drove him to madness."--Boston Globe columnist Alex Beam, April 10.

<dd>"Though Republican leaders did not attend the memorial service or funeral, several sent condolence notes to the Brown family.

<dd>Spouse and I have shown it to a score of newsfolk, all of whom bit on Bryant Gumbo. Satire only works when it's close to the truth.
<dd>Great Stuff.

Dear MRC,
<p>
Love your FLASH news-letter! Your group is doing a much better job of keep-ing in touch with your members this way.
I did have a few suggestions:
<ol>
<li>List an E-Mail Address - Many people are like me, too busy or lazy to write a letter. I would love to see an option to send you E-Mail, you would get correspondence more often and it would be more current.
<li>Create a World Wide Web Site - This is a great way to publicize the organization. I get on the WWW often to keep track of other conservative organizations like the Christian Coalition, AFA [American Family Association], etc. I can get timely, quick info on these groups and interest in your group would be very high.
</ol>
Sincerely,
Mickey Mixon

<h3>Speaker Promises to Make Term Limits
the First Item of Business<br>if the
GOP Retains Control of the House
<p>
</h3></center>
<p>
<i>This is the speech given by Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich on March 29, 1995 in the closing moments of the House Term Limits debate.  In it, the Speaker promises to make the Term Limits Amendment the first item of business, H.J.Res. 1, in the new Congress if the Republicans maintain control of the House.</i>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
I listened with great fascination to the extraordinarily articulate gentleman from Massachusetts (Rep. Barney Frank-D), and I tried to remember back to the platonic concern about the ability of one to argue any side of a question with equal facility. I looked up the word `sophistry'. 
<p>
A subtle, tricky, superficially plausible but generally fallacious method of reasoning. 
<p>
And I realized that speed of language is not the same as wisdom. Let me give just a few examples. 
<p>
This amendment does not preempt the States. It sets a cap. The Supreme Court will decide what that cap means, but the cap is not in any way worded to be binding and, in fact, in no way would change any of the current relationship of the States to their ability to do what they wish to do. 
<p>
I can assure the House that if the Supreme Court rules later on this year that the Congress need act, that we will visit that question and it may well be on a legislative rather than constitutional basis which will take 218 and not 290 votes. 
<p>
Let me say second that I believe this is a historic vote. I have been frankly surprised by our friends on the left. I would have thought, having been defeated last fall for the first time in 40 years, that paying some attention to the American people would have been useful. 
<p>
But I will tell you where I think we are historically. This is not a new experience in America. In the late 19th century, a radical idea emerged, that Senators should be elected by popular vote, that State legislatures should no longer select the Senators. This was a change in the Constitution, an effort to take power away from professional politicians, the State legislature, and return it to the people. 
<p>
It took about 20 years for the idea to permeate Washington. But in that 20-year period, it became obvious and even the most entrenched old-time political machine came to realize that in fact there was no alternative. 
<p>
I think term limits is a very similar pattern to the election of U.S. Senators. When it first came up, I rejected it. I am troubled by it. I think in some ways it is anti-democratic. I think that part of the argument is fair. On the other hand, from city council to county commission, to school board, to State legislature, to governor, to the Congress, everywhere in America the people say they are sick of the professional politicians, they are tired of
those who use the taxpayers' money to stay entrenched, and they want to find a device to take power back from the professional political class. They say it in New York City, they say it in Los Angeles. They say it in Idaho, they say it in Florida. Everywhere in America. 
<p>
Now, we are being visited tonight by the fifth grade from Cliffside School in Rutherford County, North Carolina. I would bet a great deal of money that by the time they are old enough to vote, we will have passed term limits, because in the end, the will of the American people is sovereign, no matter how much sophistry, and no matter how many reservations. The fact is that if over time in State after State in county after county the American people say this is an experiment they are willing to risk, sooner or later they will get their way. 
<p>
One of our good friends the gentleman from Montana got up and said. `This is the sound of the Contract dying.' Let me tell you, my friend, tonight 85 percent or more of the Republican Party will vote with the American people for term limits. My guess is tonight 60 to 70 percent of the Democratic party will vote against the American people and against term limits. We will go to the country in 1996 with a simple pledge. It will be a new version of the contract. We are not going to have one of these between now and 1997, but a new version. It will say H.J.Res. 1, Term Limits, will be voted on as the first item in the new Congress if we are the majority. 
<p>
The Democratic Party has it in its power tonight, if half the Democrats, only half, vote with 85 percent of the Republicans, term limits will pass tonight. It will take deliberate decision of the Democratic Party to deny the American people an opportunity, and we are not even fully passing it, we just send it to the Senate, then the Senate has to send it to the States. 
<p>
We are not afraid to allow the American people to have a chance in their State legislatures to render judgment. We are not afraid to allow the Senate to look at this amendment. But I can promise you, if the Democratic Party tonight defeats term limits, the Contract may have been postponed in one of its 10 items, but it will be back and when we have picked up enough additional seats in 1996, we will pass it as H.J.Res. 1 in 1997.

<h2>Term Limits Questions and Answers</h2>
</center>
<br>
Term Limits opponents often tend to ask the same questions over and over again.  ABIC has developed this page to help set aside some of the anti-term limit myths once and for all.  Below, you'll find some of the most frequently asked questions by opponents and our responses.  If you have any questions about this issue, please feel free to e-mail us and we'll try to answer your question, too!<p>
<br>
<b><i>"With congressional term limits, wouldn't we lose all that experience?"</b></i>
<p>
First of all, what has all that experience gotten us?  A huge federal deficit.  A spiraling federal debt.  Budget bills with little pork-barrel spending items that their sponsors know wouldn't pass on their own.  And a federal bureaucracy and a set of regulations that aren't serving the people and issues they were set up to serve.
<p>
Second, sure we have lots of members who have years of experience in that office.  But how many insightful intellects and energetic hearts have we lost because the process is so closed?  Who in his or her right mind would run against a 15- or 30-year incumbent?  Is Henry Hyde really the only person from north Chicago who can serve that constituency?  Is Vic Fazio really the only person in Sacramento qualified to serve the citizens of his district in the national legislature?  And if that expericnce is so wonderful, who's to say that it can't be used in another office, perhaps the other chamber of Congress or a statewide seat or the state legislature or even in the federal executive branch?
<p>
<br>
<b><i>"We have term limits--they are called elections."</b></i>
<p>
This assumes that today's elections are 100% open and fair, giving voters true choices.  Americans inside and outside the beltway know that the current electoral process is incredibly skewed toward the incumbent.  The financial and other advantages available to incumbents grossly tip the playing field toward incumbents, making it virtually impossible to have truly competitive electoral races.  The point of term limits is to open up the process.  Term limits will create more <i>open</i> and <i>fair</i> elections. 
<p>
<br>
<b><i>"What we really need is serious campaign finance reform."</b></i>
<p>
Everyone agrees that campaign finance reform is needed.  But that alone won't do it.  And no one believes that politicians will pass a law which makes it harder for them to win their elections.
<p>
There are several problems with some of the campaign finance reform ideas:  if you set a spending limit (the idea most discussed in political circles), instead of hurting the incumbent or even leveling the playing field, this actually helps the incumbent.  A challenger has to spend more than an incumbent just to break even: the incumbent already has much more name recognition, a franking ability, and so on.  Incumbents spend years serving their constituents.  When there's a flood, the local media interviews the congressman, senator and local officials to see what they are doing to help.  And so on.  The member communicates every so often with constituents to let them know what he/she is doing.  To a certain extent, this is part of the process of governing.  But it does give the incumbent an advantage that the challenger must overcome.  And spending limits will only hurt the challenger.
<p>
There is an interesting anecdote which illustrates this: Rep. Bob Inglis (R-SC) tells the story of his first campaign for the U.S. House in 1992.  Running against an incumbent, he was faced with all sorts of problems unique to challengers.  While the incumbent was invited to factory after factory, workplace after workplace, event after event, his campaign had to bite, pinch, scream, and kick to get invited to <i>one</i> factory.  Now he's invited to factories and workplaces all the time.  When he was running as a challenger, he had to spend his nights working at his law practice to keep his billable hours up to support his family while he campaigned during the day.  Meanwhile, his incumbent opponent was given a month's <i>recess</i> to come home and campaign <i>full-time</i>.
<p>
How does campaign finance reform help any of this?  We need <i>both</i> term limits and some <i>real</i> campaign finance reform.  And we won't get the latter without first having the former.
<p>
<br>
<b><i>"The 1994 elections proved that we don't need term limits."</b></i>
<p>
In the "revolutionary" 1994 elections, 90% of those incumbents who ran won.  In 1996, the rate was 95%.  The message to incumbents is: if you run, you have better than a 9 in 10 chance of winning.  The message to potential challengers is: if you run, you have less than a 1 in 10 chance--pretty poor odds if you're thinking about running for Congress against an incumbent.  Term limits are necessary to even the playing field.
<p>
<center>* * *</center><br>
<p>
The bottom line is that term limits will open up a process which is currently closed to average American citizens.  For example, in the current 105th Congress, 70% of the women serving in the House of Representatives were elected in open seats.  And 83% of the minorities in the House were elected in open seats.  Creating more open seats creates more opportunities for <i>all</i> Americans to participate in their democratic process and makes our federal government less responsive to the needs of inside-the-Beltway special interests and more responsive to the needs of everyday Americans.

<title>ABIC - Demographic Breakdown of American Support for TL</title>

<img src="/abic/images/demograp.gif" border="0" ALT="Chart: Demographic Breakdown of American Support for Term Limits">
</center>
<p>
<br>

In the first House floor vote on term limits, 82% of the Republicans voted <i>yes</i>.  Conversely, 82% of the Democrats voted <i>no</i>.
<p>
These numbers are even more significant when viewed in light of the wishes of the American people.  In January 1996, the Tarrance Group conducted a national poll of registered voters on behalf of the Term Limits Amendment National Campaign.  According to the data, 77% of the American people favor term limits while only 17% oppose the idea.  Of those, 59% <i>strongly</i> favor term limits while only 9% strongly oppose it. (See <a href="/abic/peoplepie.html.cgi">chart</a>.)
<p>
But most importantly, when broken into demographic groups, every group supports congressional term limits, including Conservative Democrats (who support the issue by an <b>80%</b> margin) and even Moderate and Liberal Democrats (65%)!  This means that the House Democrats were not just voting against the wishes of the American people as a whole, <i>they were voting against the wishes of their own voters!</i>

Source: "Corporate Welfare Reform?", Janice C. Shields and James M. Sheehan, <a href="http://www.washtimes.com">Washington Times</a>, P. A17, September 4, 1996.
<p>
<i>Excerpts from the Washington Times piece:</i>
<p>
The Federal Government's Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) "doles out corporate welfare through direct loans, loan guarantees and political risk insurance...
<p>
OPIC's welfare for multinational corporations can be very costly.  As of Sept. 30, 1995, the agency reported more than $4 billion in outstanding loan guarantees and $10 billion in outstanding insurance.  OPIC estimates that $14.6 million of its outstanding direct loans won't be repaid.  In the event that borrowers default on the direct or guaranteed loans, the ultimate risk is borne by the U.S. government (read: "taxpayers").
<p>
To balance the federal budget and downsize government, Congress claims to be scaling back wasteful spending programs and eliminating others.  No so for corporate pork, which has somehow survived the cuts and will even grow faster.  The bill to reauthorize OPIC through the year 2001 nearly doubles the ceiling on OPIC's investment insurance to $25 billion, and more than doubles OPIC's financing authority to $20 billion."

<H3>"The Mysterious Disappearance of the Metcalf Amendment:<BR>
<EM>A True Life Congressional Thriller</EM>. . .</H3>
<P>
<b>Chapter 3</b>
<P>
The Metcalf Amendment Reappears...<br>
....as the Thompson Amendment!!
</center><p>
In Chapters 1 and 2, we learned that ABIC has been following the disappearance of the so-called Metcalf Amendment. In July, we pointed the finger at the 67 House members who voted against the Amendment offered by Rep. Jack Metcalf (R - WA) to stop the automatic pay increase scheduled for members of Congress.  The House adopted the amendment and under its provisions, Congress would receive no payraise this year.  (Note:  Congressional salaries in 1996 are $133,644 per year.)
<P>
We also learned that when the bill came out of the Senate committee, the Metcalf amendment had <b><i>vanished without a trace</i></b>.  No one knew how it disappeared or whodunnit! In <a href="/abic/ptf/7-29-96.html.cgi">Chapter 1</a>, ABIC pointed the finger at the prime suspects.
<P>
While no amount of detective work will reveal how the Metcalf Amendment disappeared in the Committee, <b>the day was ultimately saved by none other than...<P>
<center><h3>Senator Fred Thompson (R-TN)!</b></h3></center>

Charles Grassley</b> (R-IA), <b>sponsored an amendment on the floor of the Senate which would do the exact same thing as the Metcalf Amendment.</b> It would stop the automatic congressional payraise!<p>

<P>
In his floor statement, Sen. Thompson said, "The amendment we offer today is based upon the simple proposition that while we are asking the American people to make these (sacrifices), we must ask the same of ourselves...  We need to lead by example by showing the American people that we in Congress are willing to make a personal contribution to the effort of balancing the budget."
<P>
In short order, the Amendment passed the full Senate with a voice vote.  So now that both the House and the Senate have passed this measure, it is now very likely that it will clear the conference committee and become law.<p>
So, this week ABIC points the finger at a group of <i><b>good</i></b> guys: the six co-sponsors of the Thompson Amendment.
