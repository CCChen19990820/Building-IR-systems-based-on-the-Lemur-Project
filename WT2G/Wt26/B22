<h1 align=center>Annual Report<br>
01.07.1994 - 31.06.1995</h1>
<p><font size=4><em><strong>Baltic Centre for Writers and Translators</strong></em></font></p>
<p>- was created as a tangible result of the 1992 Writers' and Translators' Cruise, &quot;Baltic 
Waves&quot;, was inaugurated in May, 1993 and commenced its activities in July that year</p>
<p>- is a joint Centre for Writers and Translators from the Baltic region: Russia, Estonia, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Poland, Germany, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Finland</p>
<p>- is operated as a non-profit organization, financed by the Swedish Government and, partly 
by the County of Gotland Administration and the Municipality of Gotland</p>
<p>-	has as its member the Swedish Writers' Union, the County of Gotland Administration and 
the Municipality of Gotland</p>
<p><font size=4><em><strong>Objectives</strong></em></font></p>
<p>The Baltic Centre for Writers and Translators is supposed to</p>
<p>-	stimulate the literary and lingiustic exchange between the countries around the Baltic Sea</p>
<p>- serve as a place of working and meeting for writers and translators from the member 
countries</p>
<p>- promote the Centre as a site for seminars, cooperative projects, educational programs, 
and conferences within a literary or linguistic context</p>
<p>- support the construction of a reference library on Baltic literature, complete with an 
information data base</p>
<p>- act as a promoter within the cultural politics of the Baltic region</p>
<p>- work to enhance the collaboration between writers and translators in the area, while 
prioritizing east-west aspects</p>
<p>One of last year's partial aims was to strengthen the activities at the Centre itself according 
to guidelines and desires expressed from the early days on, to develop routines and to find a 
balance between supply and demand. A deliberate attempt was also made to disseminate 
information about the Centre and its possibilities, with a concentration mainly on the former 
Eastern countries.</p>
<p>Another partial aim was to solicit funds for grants and to request donations of books within 
the member countries.<br>
Also, an integration between the various writers' and translators' associations and the Centre 
was actively sought.<br>
Furthermore, with a very limited budget and few resources, a large project was carried out - 
The International Poetry Festival - where the chief aim was to familiarize the citizens of 
Gotland with the Centre.</p>
<p>Hopefully this report will show that the Centre has met the above objectives as is testified to 
by the fact that most of the guests at the Centre were from the former Eastern countries and 
that funds for grants and book donations were obtained from those areas.</p>
<p>A considerable number of articles on the Centre and its activities have appeared in 
newspapers and magazines in all the countries. The Writers' Unions of St.Petersburg, 
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland have described in very positive terms the importance 
of the Centre for both the unions and the individual writers and translators.</p>
<p>The Centre Office has two employees, a Director and an Administrative Assistant, acting as 
the executive body of the organization. Their tasks involve booking of guests, taking care of 
guests and visitors, contact and information activities, correspondence, guided tours of the 
Centre, handling of scholarship applications, planning and execution of various projects, 
managing monetary contributions, preparing statements of accounts, collaborating with 
various institutions and acting as the secretariat of the Baltic Writers' Council.</p>
<p><font size=4><em><strong>Guests</strong></em></font><br>
During the fiscal year 1994/1995 the Centre's 11 guest rooms were occupied by visitors 
during 2 091 days.</p>
<p><em><strong>Big Projects throughout the Year</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Russian-Swedish Translators' Seminar</strong></em> August 25 - 31, with 20 participants from 
Sweden, St. Petersburg and Moscow in collaboration with the Swedish Embassy in 
Moscow and the Swedish Institute.</p>
<p><em><strong>Cultural Journals around the Baltic Conference</strong></em> November 22 - 6, with 30 
participants from the entire region. Financed with Ars Baltica money.</p>
<p><em><strong>Meetings of Images</strong></em> January 28 - 30, a seminar with 20 children's books' illustrators and 
animators from the Baltic region. A collaboration with the Film Program on Gotland, the Art 
Museum of Gotland and the County Library. Financed by the Swedish Institute.</p>
<p><em><strong>Nordic Writers' Council's Meeting</strong></em> April 27 - 30 with 35 representatives from the 
writers' and translators' unions of the Nordic countries.</p>
<p><em><strong>Cultural Links between Islands</strong></em><br>
We had Greek Days at the Centre May 11 - 14 with guests from Rhodes and Athens, 
headed by the Mayor of Rhodes Mr. George Giannopoulos and the Greek Ambassador to 
Sweden Mr. Emmanuel Kalpadakis. Professor Sture Linn&eacute;r and other members of the 
Swedish-Greek Cultural Association were also invited and so were 12 Greek and Swedish 
poets. Peter Curman was as usual the driving force in the meeting. Among other things we 
had arranged for a Greek evening at the Centre, a poetry reading at the Art Museum and 
many contacts between Gotlandic and Greek authorities and institutions. The intention was 
mainly to give the Greek delegation the inspiration for a Sister Centre on Rhodes, and to 
sound out a possible interest in future cultural exchange and cooperation.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Poetry Festival</strong></em><br>
The Second International Poetry Festival on Gotland called &quot;From Bellman to Bellman&quot; 
took place June 11 - 14 and had 35 participants: poets, troubadours, translators, and 
Bellman experts from the Baltic region. During the festival we had seven poetry shows 
around the island, for instance on the island of F&aring;r&ouml;, at Bl&auml;se Limestone Museum, 
Kapitelhusg&aring;rden and the Frimurarhuset in Visby. A documentary was made during the 
festival.</p>
<p><em><strong>Newsletter</strong></em><br>
With the help of Inguna Bekere, International Secretary from the Latvian Writers' Union , 
we produced four issues of our Newsletter, with many contributions from all the member 
countries.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Black Sea</strong></em><br>
The Black Sea Cruise took place during ten days, November 13 - 23, and went from 
Athens to Odessa and back to Athens again with 400 writers and translators from 30 
countries. The Centre played a central role and the Director participated. The Cruise 
resulted in the Delphi Declaration and a catalog, Word Renaissance, where Gotland is 
strongely represented.</p>
<p><em><strong>Open House at the Centre</strong></em><br>
On December 18 we had a poetry reading at the Centre with Li Li, Tobias Berggren, 
Estonian and also local poets.</p>
<p>January 29 we had Open House at the Centre in connection with the Meetings of Images 
and also February 14 after the lecture by Ulla Rhedin.</p>
<p><em><strong>Other Items of Interest</strong></em><br>
On May 18 Swedish Radio P1 Tendens was broadcast live fom the Centre, and in 
connection with the Poetry Festival Maarja Talgre recorded a one-hour Salongen program 
for Swedish Radio together with some of the visiting poets; Jesper Svenbro, Jaan Kaplinski, 
Ylva Eggehorn, and Karin Bellman.</p>
<p>September 12, Gunilla Fors&eacute;n gave a speech at the Solhem Rotary Club.</p>
<p>November 6 - 7, Gunilla Fors&eacute;n was invited to the Literaturhaus in Vienna, Austria to give a 
speech on the Centre and its activities to 50 translators from all of Europe.</p>
<p>At the beginning of October Gunilla Fors&eacute;n visited the Centre Culturel Suedois in Paris to 
discuss a Baltic Cultural manifestation in Paris.</p>
<p>October 27 - 30 Gunilla Fors&eacute;n and Annette Glover visited &quot;Bok &amp; Bibliotek&quot;, the annual 
book fair in Gothenburg, where the Centre was represented in the Gotlandic Culture display 
case.</p>

<p>May 18 Gunilla Fors&eacute;n participated in the Baltic Sea conference in Norrk&ouml;ping, Sweden.</p>
<p>June 9 - 12 Gunilla Fors&eacute;n visited Helsinki to disseminate information about the Centre.</p>
<p><em><strong>Summer Substitute at the Centre</strong></em><br>
Last year as the year before, Sasja Afinogenova, a translator from Moscow filled in at the 
office during the summer.</p>
<p><em><strong>Grants Received</strong></em><br>
The Silverh&auml;ttan Rotary Club of Visby donated 7 000 SEK for the Latvian poet Vizma 
Belsevica's stay at the Centre. Vizma spent the month of April at the Centre and wrote the 
second part of her autobiography there. During this time, old poems started to surface in her 
mind, things she wrote in the 1960s and never could publish because the originals were 
confiscated by the KGB.</p>
<p>The European Council in Strasbourg donated two grants for translators from the former 
east, which were given to Alexander Branski, St. Petersburg and Silvia Brice, Riga.</p>
<p><em><strong>Donations</strong></em><br>
The Centre has recieved a generous donation from Desi Viksten consisting of two oil 
paintings and 12 lithographs made by the late Hans Viksten.</p>
<p>Helena Andreeff has donated a painting, in memory of the Library of Sarajevo.</p>
<p>The library of the Centre has received several large and small book donations from 
institutions and private persons from different countries. In the spring of 1995 a donation of 
300 valuable reference books in Polish was presented during a cermony at the Polish 
Embassy in Stockholm.</p>
<p>The Nordic Information offices in both Vilnius and Riga have been most helpful in putting 
together a collection of reference books in each of the two languages and in sending them to 
the Centre.</p>
<p>Several Norwegian Publishers have sent large and nice book packages.</p>
<p>The Russian Ambassador to Sweden, Mr. Oleg Grinevsky, has arranged for the donation of 
Russian reference literature.</p>

<p><em><strong>The Library</strong></em><br>
The Centre has recieved a sum of 425 000 SEK from the State Culture department for the 
foundation of a library. During a six-month period last year The Municipality of Gotland 
contributed a parttime librarian, Birgitta Rydberg, to work at the Centre, for structuring of 
the library. A custom made bookcase and some reference books were purchased, while the 
main part of the work still needs to be done. We are also with great expectation awaiting the 
report on the Gotland libraries that will be done in the fall of 1995 by Karin Olausson.</p>
<p><em><strong>BWC - Baltic Writers' Council</strong></em><br>
BWC was founded on Gotland the fall of 1993 and is a free forum for discussion for 
representatives from the Writers' and Translators' Unions around the Baltic Sea, with an 
annual meeting in Visby. In 1994 BWC extended the invitation to Iceland. That means that 
BWC now has eleven members. Every country sends two representatives to the annual 
meeting, that usually takes place in October.</p>

<p><font size="3">Sweden's book trade treat books like
perishables. Even if it took the author years to write his book,
its shelf life in the bookshop is limited to maybe six months,
whereafter it is mercilessly thrown out. It's kept in stock for a
while, then included in the annual bargain sale. It's not old
books that are offered in todays bargain sales, but new ones -
which then simply disappear. This part of our national heritage
can then only be found in our libraries. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Swedish bookselling business is the most
unregulated in Europe, perhaps in the entire world. Ever since
the system of fixed book prices was abandoned in 1970, the
various parties of the book business are at each others throats.
Book clubs and major stores wage battle against traditional book
stores; the publishers have terminated the authors' agreement
from 1947. Chaos reigns in the Swedish book market.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Pending proposals in a forthcoming report from
the Ministry of Culture, we authors have to deal with these
problems on our own. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Thanks to a cooperation with Arkitektkopia and
with the aid of new technology - Internet and Print-On-Demand -
it is now possible to offer out-of-print books in a new and
relatively cheap manner.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Just fill in the </font><a

have a book in the mail in a matter of days!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This collection of &quot;women's rights
poetry&quot; by &quot;Lotta Strömberg&quot; (a nom de plume) is
now available for the the first time in book form. The poems were
written in connection with a television program scrutinizing
opportunistic trend policies adopted by today's publishers.
During the actual transmission of the program Mr. Stig Edling,
then publisher at Prisma, realized he was the subject of a
practical joke and turned down the collection. Thanks to
Print-On-Demand this book can now reach readers on wings of its
own.</font></p>

<h1>Background and examples </h1>
<p><img src="images/seminar1-s.JPG" align="left" hspace="10"
width="250" height="189">In the Congress Hall of Paradise Hotel
at Rhodes writers and translators from 40 countries gathered to
discuss Internet and Literature. </p>
<p>Peter Curman, Swedish writer and member of the Organizing
Committee, welcomed the participants and stressed the importance
of intercultural relations. &#147;Soon&#148;, he said, &#147;the
publishers will gather at the Bookfair in Frankfurt. Here the
decisions are made of wich kind of literature the readers will be
served. There is an overwhelming dominance of Anglo-American
literature and a lack of trust in Quality literature. Because it
is said to be a too small market for it. In this perspective the
Internet offers an interesting possibility. It can be a tool in
the hands of writers, literary magazines and small publishing
houses who want to create a more independent &#147;market&#148;
of literature.&#148; &#147;But&quot;, Peter Curman
concluded&#148;, there are practical problems there still to be
solved. Not least concerning literary rights. But Internet is
also a challenge for freedom of speech.&quot;</p>
<p><img src="images/intro1-s.JPG" align="left" hspace="10"
width="200" height="164">The Chairman <strong>Costas Tsoulakidis</strong>,
from the Aegean University of Rhodes, welcomed the participants
to Rhodes and dedicated the conference to Apollon, whom, Costas
thought, would have been very fond of the Internet. After that he
gave us some facts of Rhodes. Mostly about the Aegean University,
which is quite special, being situated on four different islands.
Therefore communication is essential. To exchange mail, databases
and other kinds of information Internet has now become a
necessity. Costas Tsoulakidis then explained the technical
possibilities and the history of Internet. &#147;World Wide
Web&#148;, he said, &#147;can be seen as a huge worldwide <i>book&#148;.</i> </p>
<p>Mart Marend from Gotland presented the internet server Mare
Balticum. He demonstrated how it is possible to present
literature on the net. One of the aims of Waves of Three Seas is
that all of the participating countries create a literary
homepage. Mare Balticum served as an example. &#147;It's actually
like a database&#148;, he says. It's like a directory of the
servers in the Baltic region. He showed The Literary Scene, a
database of literature, facilitating contacts across borders. </p>

width="90" height="155"></strong><font size="4"><strong>Nicholaos
Sandu</strong></font><strong><br>
</strong>from Romania, stressed the importance of Internet as a
means of communication. But, he remarked, there is still a lot of
practical problems waiting to be solved. He raised the topic of
accessibility to the Internet for authors, translators and the
general public in the eastern European countries. Mr Sandu hoped
that this seminar will adress this problem. </p>
<hr>
<p><img src="images/portrait2-s.JPG" align="left" hspace="10"
width="250" height="195"><font size="4"><strong>Novica Milic</strong></font><strong><br>
</strong>from the Belgrade Circle, started with a discussion of
computers - is it a typewriter or a way of communicating? Both,
of course. It's important to discover the possibilities this
technology provides. It's vital to ask &#147;What is computer
technology doing to the world? To ourselves?&#148; </p>
<p>During the war in Yugoslavia communication broke down. But
thanks to the Internet there was a possibility to uphold
communications between Belgrade, Zagreb and Sarajevo during the
war years. For two years this was the only way of passing
messages back and forth. It helped to establish contacts between
members of familys that were divided. </p>
<p>Internet itself was constructetd by the military to overcome
breakdowns in communicationlines between computers. &#147;So you
have to go beyond the cuts, and that's how Internet works.&#148;
During the war small networks of people with computers and access
to Internet were created. The principle is the same with the
Internet as a whole; there is not one single center, but several.
Networks exist on different levels, from the family and up, at
the workplace, nationwide and globally. It is crucial to connect
these networks to each other. </p>
<p><a name="Internetional">Novica Milic</a> told us about his
plans for the online-magazine InterNETional. The aim with this
project is to promote &#147;internetional&#148; contacts; to
create new kinds of virtual communities. </p>
<p>&#147;If we understand this technology, we can use it in a
more sensible way&#148;, he concluded.</p>

<h3>After the lectures there was time for discussions and
remarks. </h3>
<p><img src="india.JPG" align="left" hspace="10" width="120"
height="133">Who shall give us the information, who is
responsible for what? Who is responsible for the quality of the
material? Who is, in other words, the Webmaster? asked <strong>Indra
Nath Choudhuri</strong> from New Delhi. He stressed the
importance of discussing these important questions. </p>
<p>Another topic was censorship on the Internet. Is it possible?
Novica Milic replied by telling us about the strategies to
exchange information that where used during the war in former
Yugoslavia. </p>
<p><strong><img src="ryssen.JPG" align="right" hspace="10"
width="200" height="224"></strong><strong>Alexander Zhitinsky</strong>,
editor of <a href="http://www.spb.su/art/">Art<b> </b>Petersburg</a>,<b> </b>the
online-magazine in Saint Petersburg, showed the magazine and
pointed out texts that are published exclusively on the Web. </p>
<p>After this discussion Dimitrios Kilias from FORTHnet, Greece,
showed us some strategies to search for information on the
Internet. He demonstrated different search-strategies and how to
use the search-tools available. He underlined the importance of
being specific when one tries to find information. </p>
<p><img src="mart.JPG" align="left" hspace="10" width="150"
height="115">Yet another topic raised was privacy. Can anyone
read what I send, for example, as e-mail over the Internet? More
important than questions on security and cryptation is how we
relate to the new technology, said <strong>Mart Marend</strong>.
Questions concerning authenticity and falsifications were also
discussed. Mart Marend had to conclude that, as with any other
form of media, there is no guarantee that the material published
on the Internet is authentic. Do we believe everything we read in
our daily newspaper? We must develop the same critical attitude
towards electronical publications as we have done towards
information printed on paper. </p>
<p><img src="portrait3.JPG" align="left" hspace="10" width="120"
height="177">&#147;Life is always life-dangerous&#148; concluded <strong>Theo
In der Smitten</strong>. The Internet is as important as the
invention of printing or the novel. We must embrace this new
technology with open arms. <br clear="all">

<h3>Copyright issues, creativity and freedom of expression</h3>
<p><b><img src="helge.JPG" align="left" hspace="10" width="200"
height="331"></b><b>Helge Sonneland</b>, from the Norwegian
Cultural Ministry, started the afternoon session by discussing
copyright-issues. </p>
<p>What is copyright? he asked. Copyright is an important
cultural legislation, but also a business legislation (3% of
Norways GNP comes for example from trades based on copyright). It
is, therefore, also in economic terms an important legislation.
The <i>raison d &ecirc;tre</i> of copyright is to stimulate
creativity in order to grant economic remuneration and hence
establish conditions for the creative work to continue. </p>
<p>Sonneland gave a short history of the copyright legislation:
From the first copyright statute in the world in Britain in 1709,
over the Berne convention from 1886 to the international
regulations of today. </p>
<p>In spite of the differences in national legislation &#147;we
are all, more or less, in the same boat&#148; said Sonneland who
presented the basic exclusive rights inherent in copyright. The
question is: What happens when the existing copyright legislation
confronts the Internet? A lot of problems occur. Which laws are
applicable? In the process of publishing on the net, <i>what</i>
copy is the one that should be covered by legislation - the one
on the server, on the readers hard drive, or the copy that is
printed out on paper etc? What kind of exemptions from the
exclusive right granted by law are needed in a digital age? What
is &#147;delivery on demand&#148; in copyright terms? </p>
<p>A lot of question that is in urgent need for solutions.
&#147;One thing is sure&#148;, Helge Sonneland concluded,
&#147;Copyright is not dead because of the Internet&#148;. </p>
<p><b><img src="gun.JPG" align="right" hspace="10" width="170"
height="258"></b><b>Gun Magnusson</b>, a lawyer representing
Copyswede, Sweden, has worked all her life with copyright issues.
She talked about copyright-problems in the digital era. But, as
she remarked, the questions are not new: &#147;Copyright has
always been a problem for the people who don't want to pay&#148;. </p>
<p>The copyright-agreements are quite different in different
parts of the world. For example in the Anglo-American world the
publishers or producers aquire much more rights than in Sweden,
where the writers keep a lot of their rights. But things are
changing, the media-situation is getting more complex, the fights
for rights more tough. But there is still a possibility to keep
the rights as a writer, Magnusson urged. Here both administrating
and technological methods are needed. They are at hand. Authors
are well organized. </p>
<p>Concerning administration Magnusson takes the publishing of an
homepage on Internet as an example. In this case it's the
legislation of the country where the homepage is published - that
is the country where the computer, the server, is situated -
which is relevant. </p>
<p>Concerning the technical methods, Magnusson points out that
the central question is about how to identify the authors, and
that means on an international basis. There are several attempts
made lately. 1994 an organization called <a
href="http://www.cisac.com">CISAC</a> was formed, and the
CIS-project started, which aims to create a code, CAE, for every
single author. There is also a project for creating another code,
ISWC, for the specific works, musical as well as literary and
visual. With multi-media, the situation is getting even harder;
but the most important thing is, as Magnusson repeated at the end
of her lecture: Hold on to your rights. </p>

<hr>
<p><img src="mette.JPG" align="left" hspace="10" width="200"
height="151">Today, said <strong>Mette Newth</strong> from
Norway, authors are often seen as someone who is preventing
access to information on Internet. They are blocking the
development of the net by claiming their literary rights. But,
she continued, this is far to simple. There exists a strong link
between copyright and freedom of expression. They are two sides
of the same coin. It is important, she said, not to mix free
access with free of charge. Without copyright, and the
possibility <i>to some extent</i> charge for information, there
will be no freedom of expression. </p>
<p>Mette Newth presented the project Norwegian Forum for Freedom
of Expression, an independent liaison between 15 norwegian
organisations. The aim with the Forum is to promote freedom of
expression and free debate all over the world. </p>
<p>Since the Internet knows no geographical borders a mighty
problem is confronting those governments who wants to control the
political, moral or religious views of there citizens. Mette
Newth referred the discussion about the Communication Decency Act
in the USA over the last year. There is a problem, she claimed,
when one tries to control the <i>decency</i> of for example
literature. Instead she proposed two principles: 1) Explicit
prohibition against prior censorship, and 2) Explicit prohibition
against censorship by indirect methods, that is prohibition
against necessary technical devices. </p>
<p>&#147;The Internet&#148; she concluded, &#147;has the
potential to be a tremendous force for development - by providing
quick and inexpensive information, by encouraging discussion
rather than violence, and by empowering citizens, to cite but a
few examples. But this potential can be realized only if it
becomes a truly global effort. Policy makers must make every
effort to ensure that internationally guaranteed rights to free
expression are extended to on-line communication and call for the
repeal of censorship legislation. Without such commitments,
individuals face the danger of seeing their rights eroded by the
very technologies they are embracing.&#148; </p>
<p>The final discussion left us with some unanswered questions,
some of them to be answered tomorrow, and a lot of questions with
a lot of answers: How to put a price on the information? Who
shall pay for it? Isn't the main purpose in the end publicity?
What about the others, the ones not on-line? </p>
<p>The last words to Theo In der Smitten:</p>

<h1 align=center>Writers' and Translators' Centre of Rhodes</h1>
<p align=left>A new International Writers' and Translators' Centre recently opened on Rhodes, Greece. Nearly three hundred 
writers, translators, cultural personalities, media representatives and supporters from over thirty countries attended 
the inauguration on September 23-28, 1996. The programme included a seminar on literature and internet, poetry 
readings, lectures, discussions and an official opening ceremony, all generously hosted by the Municipality of Rhodes 
in collaboration with the working committee of the &#147;WAVES OF THREE SEAS&#147; with support from various 
sponsors.</p>
<p><img src="images/rhodes.gif" align=left hspace=10 width=264 height=183>The Centre itself (the former British Admiralty Building), is 
beautifully located on the slope underneath the old acropolis, 
overlooking the sea and only five minutes walk from the town. The 
newer part of the building with 10 bedrooms is ready to receive the 
first guests from the beginning of January 1997. Lorraine Hunt, a 
British born interpreter and translator (English, Greek, French, 
German) has been appointed Director of the Centre. Until her office 
is fully equipped, Ms Hunt will be operating from the Municipality 
and she will be pleased to give further information on telephone 
+30-241-46 314 or fax +30-241-46 323.<br clear=left>
</p>
<h3 align=center>Background</h3>
<p>This new writers' and translators' centre of Rhodes is one of the main concrete results of a literary cruise which took 
place in November 1994. Over 400 writers, translators and journalists, mainly from the countries around the Baltic, 
the Black and the Aegean Seas, travelled together during a fortnight from Piraeus to Odessa, Varna, Constanta, 
Istanbul and Izmir. Through an intensive programme with seminars and readings onboard and ashore a dialogue 
across borders began.</p>
<h3 align=center>Baltic Centre for Writers and Translators</h3>
<p>A similar cruise was made in the Baltic Sea in 1992, right after the fall of the Soviet Union, which has led to many 
significant results, among them a writers' and translators' centre on the island of Gotland, Sweden, which has become 
an important cultural meeting place in the middle of the Baltic Sea. The Gotland centre now serves as a model for 
Rhodes, which is an ideal site in the cross roads between east and west in the Aegean. Parallel to the inauguration of 
the Rhodes' Centre the towns of Rhodes and Visby of Gotland celebrated their twinning with a joint cultural festival, 
also this a result of the two cruises.</p>
<h3 align=center>Aims</h3>
<p>Both centres are international independent institutions open to all writers and translators, according to the aims of 
free dialogue, mutual understanding and tolerance that has guided our project from the beginning. The belief in the 
strength of literature serving as bridge to cultural peace is the base of our co-operation. This is also why UNESCO 
has decided to authorise our two centres to operate under UNESCO auspices, which will safeguard the international 
quality of our activities.</p>
<h3 align=center><b>More Centres to come</b></h3>
<p>The ultimate goal is to build a network of literary centres in many countries. Two new centres are already approved 
and on their way. One on the B&uuml;y&uuml;kada Island outside Istanbul with the support from the Turkish Foreign Ministry. 
The second one by the Prespa Lake in northern Greece, upon initiative of Greek and Albanian writers with the help 
of the Thessaloniki Cultural Capital. Other proposals have been made from Odessa-Ukraine, Constanta-Romania, 
Pitsunda-Abkhazia and Georgia.</p>
<h3 align=center>Financing and Support</h3>
<p>The necessary restoration and reconstruction of the premises of the Rhodes centre, as well as the running costs, are 
being covered and carried out by the Municipality of Rhodes. Various official institutions and private sponsors - 
international and national - have generously contributed to the preparatory work and the inauguration of the Centre. 
Yet, further financing is needed for the continuation, such as seminars and literary meetings in the centre, grants to 
writers and translators from countries without financial possibilities. We are also hoping for support from international 
organisations i.e. UNESCO and EU. </p>
<p>A full report from the inauguration, with presentation on the centre, the goals of the organisation and the future 
perspectives is under preparation for distribution in December 1996. In January 1997 the first writers and translators 
will come to stay and work in the centre. In the end of March 1997 a general assembly with all the participating 
writers' organisations will be held in Rhodes to elect an international committee, which will be responsible for the 
cultural activities of the centre. A local, legal administrative board for the running of the centre is already appointed. 
Meanwhile, the working committee will continue its function until the general assembly. Among their tasks is to study 
the possibilities of &#147;WAVES OF THREE SEAS&#147; becoming an NGO (non governmental organisation) and to keep 
our network alive in close collaboration with the Municipality of Rhodes. </p>
<h3 align=center>Next on the Agenda</h3>
<p>A special working comittee has been elected to carry out the preparatory work with the main task of fundraising and 
to keep all the participating organisations informed on the progress. </p>

we could open new ways of contacts between writers, literary
magazins, publishers and others. As we also want to protect the
copyright of the writer in electronic publishing we have invited
experts in this field from various countries. We intend to give

<p><font size=7>People in a Landscape</font> </p>
<p><img src="images/andreas.JPG" align=right hspace=10 width=150 height=147>Maybe it<b> </b>is because of these difficulties of communication that we enjoy 
playing Chinese Whispers. This is a game where the participants are sitting 
at the end of the row and a person in the end of the row whispers a 
sentence to his neighbour who in turn poses it on to his neighbour etc. The 
person at the end of the row says the sentence aloud and it is totally 
distorted. Everybody laughs. </p>
<p>Why are we laughing? Presumably because we so easily misunderstand 
each other. The paradox is that we are united in this situation: we both produce and bridge the 
shortcomings of linguistic communication. </p>
<p>Here you can see an example of a similar game, but one I have made up. It is a kind of &#148;translation 
relay&#148;. A section of the Swedish poet Tomas Transtr&ouml;mer&#146;s poem &#148;Baltic Seas&#148; has been entitled 
&#148;People in a Landscape&#148;. This section, which was already translated from Swedish into French, was 
presented as an original French poem (&#148;Des gens dans un paysage&#148;) to an English translator. Then the 
English translation was presented to a Russian translator and then it was translated as an original 
Russian poem into Swedish. In the same way it was translated into Turkish, and on into French, English 
and so forth. </p>
<p>The original text is on a white background, the rest are blushing. </p>
<p>The poem by Transtr&ouml;mer is based on a photograph (&#148;&Aring;ngslupen Vikingen...&#148; ) In this regard this fact 
the orignal poem is in itself a kind of translation or interpretation from image to text. </p>

<h1 align=center>News from the Centre<br>
and Baltic Writers Council</h1>
<p><a name="the book fair"><font size=4><strong>The Book Fair</strong></font></a><font size=4><strong> in Gothenburg</strong></font></p>
<p>26-29 October collected altogether some 100.000 visitors and was a strong manifestation 
for the book in general and with a strong emphasis on the freedom of expression. Great 
international names like Salman Rushdie, Yassar Kemal, Bei Dao, Doris Lessing and the 
Nobel Prize laureate Sheamus Heaney were among the large number of participants.</p>
<p>Many representatives from the Baltic region also were at the fair, writers and translators 
who took part in many different ways. Emil Tode (pseudonym for Tonu Onnepalu) was 
there to talk about his book Piiririik, which has lately been published in Sweden. Jaan 
Kaplinski gave an interesting lesson to his audience, comparing the situation in his country 
with a harem. With the collapse of communism the doors to the harem were suddenly wide 
open and nobody was any longer interested in the destiny of its inhabitants. Today there is a 
complete freedom, which in many cases means that you are free to choose between being a 
beggar or a prostitute. He also talked about one of the great paradoxes of our time. During 
the communist era every piece of text which you succeeded to publish, even in a censured 
version, was read with great attention and had a certain impact. Today it is the opposite. 
Everyone is free to write whatever he likes but there is no interest for the truth.</p>
<p><strong>From the Baltic to the Black Sea</strong> was the title of a seminar arranged by the Swedish 
Writers Union. Peter Curman was, naturally, the moderator and among the participants you 
could see well-known faces like Ewa A. Kumlin, Yuri Pokalchuk, Sezer Duru, Alexander 
Branski and Gunilla Fors&eacute;n. The vice mayor of Rhodos and Jan Larsson from the 
municipality of Gotland completed the company by telling about the advantages of culture in 
a greater political context.</p>
<p><em>Gunilla Fors&eacute;n</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.gotlandica.se/summit96/freedom/freedom.htm" name="freedom"><font size=4><strong>Freedom of speech</strong></font></a><font size=4><strong>, information and libraries</strong></font></p>
<p>is the topic for a conference in Visby 3-4 May, 1996. At the same time there will be a 
meeting of all the Prime Ministers from the Baltic region and as we have preliminary decided 
a meeting of the Baltic Writers Council as well. Right now we are working on the program, 
searching for sponsors and also working with the idea to hire a ship for the conference. We 
imagine it could sail with the participants from Stockholm and during the meetings and 
conferences serve as hotel and hall in Visby harbour.</p>
<p>The conference is intended for writers and translators, for librarians and politicians and any 
other persons with a burning interest in these topics.</p>
<p>One of the ideas behind the conference is of course to catch the attention of the PMs and 
some of the hundreds of journalists who we expect to come to cover the Prime Ministers 
meeting.</p>
<p>The conference is organised by the Centre together with the Municipality of Gotland and the 
UBC, Union of the Baltic Cities.</p>
<p><a name="scholarships"><font size=4><strong>Scholarships</strong></font></a><font size=4><strong> for translators</strong></font></p>
<p>The European Commission has granted the Centre a financial contribution of 36.037 ECU 
for 40 bursaries for 1996. The Community bursaries may be given only to translators from 
the Member States or countries having signed association agreements with the Community, 
in this case five bursaries for the following countries: Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, 
Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and can be applied for from the Centre from now on.</p>
<p><a name="ars baltica"><font size=4><strong>ARS BALTICA</strong></font></a><font size=4><strong> in Paris October 1996</strong></font></p>
<p>The Centre together with Centre Cultural Suedois in Paris are working on a cultural project 
for October 1996. We want to present literature, jazz, fashion, animated and documentary 
films in Paris in collaboration with UNESCO. The project will be paid by Ars Baltica and 
take place at CCS, La Maison de la Poesie etc. during a week.</p>

target="_blank">Författarcentrum</a> - författarnas egen
kontaktförmedling. 1970-71 var C. medredaktör i Pockettidningen
&quot;R&quot;. 1981-83 kulturchef på nygamla
Stockholms-Tidningen och från 1983-86 kulturchef på
kvällstidningen Aftonbladet. 1987-95 ordförande i Sveriges

översättarcentret på Rhodos</a> som följd. Tack vare Ewa A.
Kumlins stora insats som samordnare i bägge projektet lyckades
Sveriges Författarförbund i nära samverkan med sina
systerförbund i Europa att lägga en ny grund för det fortsatta

<p><font size="5"><b>Slut på förlaget? Makulerade? Inga ex
kvar?<br>
- Här är lösningen. Med print-on-demand<br>
blir gamla böcker som nya!</b></font></p>

<p>Den svenska bokhandelsmarknaden behandlar böcker som
färskvaror. Även om det kan ha tagit åratal för författaren
att skriva sin bok får den som regel högst sex månader på sig
i bokhandeln. Sedan åker den skoningslöst ut. Först tillbaka
till lagret och sedan realiseras den, ofta inom ett par år.
Dagens bokreor handlar inte längre om gamla böcker utan om nya.
Någon lagerhållning värd namnet förekommer inte längre i
Sverige. Vårt nationella minne får man söka efter på
biblioteken.</p>

<p>Den svenska bokhandelsmarknaden är den mest oreglerade i
Europa, ja kanske rent av i hela världen. Sedan de fasta
bokpriserna avskaffades 1970 ligger bokbranschens parter i fejd
med varann. Bokklubbar och varuhus slåss mot bokhandeln och
bokförläggarna har sagt upp det gamla författaravtalet från
1947. Det råder alltså kaos på den svenska bokmarknaden.</p>

<p>I avvaktan på att den av kulturministern tillsatta
bokutredaren Anna-Greta Leijon kommer med förslag till
kulturpolitiska lösningar får vi författare försöka lösa
våra problem på egen hand.</p>

<p>Tack vare samarbete med <a href="http://www.akopia.se">Arkitektkopia
AB</a> och den nya tekniken - Internet och <a
href="../print-on-demand">Print on demand</a> - är det idag
möjligt att erbjuda nytryck av gamla böcker på ett nytt och
relativt billigt sätt. Fyll bara i beställningsrutan och tryck
på knappen så kommer en ny bok på posten inom några dagar! </p>

<p><font size="4"><b><u>Istället för recension:</u></b></font><font
size="5"><b><br>
</b></font><font size="6"><b>Härdsmälta</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Det finns romaner som bara kan skrivas på
svenska. Till dem hör Peter Curmans </font><a
href="../titlar/hardsmalta.htm"><font size="3">Härdsmälta</font></a><font
size="3">. Jagromaner alltså. Även om Peter Curman är poet på
svenska språket har detta hans specifikt svenska jagromantiska
berättande inte så mycket med språket och dess melodi att
göra. Dock visst är viktigt att Härdsmälta är skrivet på
svenska. Sådana jagböcker skrivs bäst i vår språkmelodi. Det
har med rytm och melodi att göra. Vi talar ett tvåtonsspråk i
ett entonigt Europa. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Minns den ramsa man som pojk lärde sig för
att skilja ut det svenska: Mulet, kulet illa vulet i de dödas
vilorum. Mot skolpojkslatinets: Mulett, kulett i la vulett i de
dö dass vilorum! Ljuda den åter och se att Europa inte ens har
alfabete nog att skilja mellan tonerna i vårt vilorum och deras
vilorum!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Härdsmälta är alltså inte bara en
fascinerande berättelse utan det är med detta svenska slags
jagroman som med den svenska arbetarlitteraturen; den är
kulturspecifik. De tycks motsatta de två genrerna, men är ett
svenskt motsatspar. Ty lika omöjligt det är att tänka sig En
dåres försvarstal skriven av en bildad medelålders fransman
eller britt lika omöjligt är det att tänka sig att någon
sådan skrivit Geniet. Genrernas grund är gemensam:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Ej riktigt klok,<br>
Ej riktigt galen'<br>
Trots alla plågans stick...</font></p>

<p><font size="3">som Ane Randel lät Francois Villon skriva i
Testamentets inledning. Den förborgerliga diktsamlingen är
förbanne mig en jagberättelse om någon! Fast sedan blev den
moderna tidens jagskrivande efterföljare i det ena stora
kontinentala seklet efter det andra - till och med Jean-Jacques!
- mer urbant och europeiskt civiliserade.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">De slipade inte bara språket, de slipade
sanningskraven till slöhet. De kliver inte på svenskt sätt
fram i sitt skrivande så som en Ågust, en karl med
långkalsonger mot det nordiska klimatet och pissrosor vid gylfen
efter kärleksstunden som skriker ut sitt elände och sin lycka. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Peter Curman är en bildad poet, urban också.
Dock blott i svensk mening. Ty riktigt civiliserad är han inte.
Han är på en gång plump och finstämd. Skamlös och drömsk
som föregångaren Villon. Eller som den Ågust vilken skrev av
sig ett sitt äktenskap i En dåres försvarstal.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Ty det är en äktenskapsberättelse Peter
Curman skrivit i denna kärlekens härdsmälta. Men inte en lite
tyskt smårunkande berättelse av Ingmar Bergmans sort. Curmans
prosa är frisk. Inte en prosa av infanteristfots slag som Ingmar
Bergmans; mjuk, rodnande och hudlöst luktande av
kamratskapsanda. Prästerligt halvnassig har Curman ju heller
aldrig varit. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Härdsmälta är en levande text. Nog känner
vi igen oss i den, vi som varit med om något eller några
äktenskap och levat oss igenom svartsjuka och passioner, sett
oss i hennes ögonspegel och upptäckt vår falskhet samtidigt
som vi tvungits ned i förtvivlan och lycka för att hamna i det
ena skilsmässoeländet efter det andra.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Det är alltså en förbannat bra bok. Det
tycke jag när jag först läste den i manuskript och det tycker
jag i dag.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>Jan Myrdal</em></font></p>

romanen Härdsmälta, som utkommer på Gedins förlag i augusti i
år. Den skildrar upplösningen av ett förljuget äktenskap där
Ann känner sig förkvävd och overklig medan Mikael ingenting
märker förrän allting är för sent och förbi. Är det kanske
ett manligt drag att skilsmässan för honom alltid tycks komma
som en blixt från en klar himmel medan den för kvinnan är
resultatet av en lång och medveten planering? Vilka ansikten
döljer vi egentligen för varandra bakom våra till synes
vardagliga, tillitsfulla skråpuksansikten?</p>

<p>Hemkomst</p>

<p>Inflygning. Dockskåpshusen ligger i prydliga rader<br>
utmed vägnätens sträckta skosnören.<br>
Fältens rektanglar signalerar grönt.<br>
Som glänsande skalbaggar kryper bilarna fram.<br>
Sex hundra meter under mig väntar Sverige<br>
med sina skogar, järnmalm, industrier och sjukhus<br>
försäkringar, skatter, barnbidrag, partier och tidningar.<br>
Vi går ner för landning.</p>

<p>Ännu ett ögonblick är jag kvar där borta<br>
innan hjulen gnisslar till mot landningsbanan.<br>
Fortfarande hör jag larmet från trängseln på gatan<br>
ropen från försäljarna, ser jag tiggarnas framsträckta<br>
händer<br>
Ännu ringer i mina öron:<br>
&quot;Glöm oss inte! När som helst kan polisen slå till!&quot;<br>
Sen slocknar motorerna och säkerhetsbältena lossas.<br>
Jag köar mig ut i den svensksvala vinden.</p>

<p>Vi far genom ett grönt landskap med rena, tysta samhällen.<br>
Välklädda människor väntar vid stoppljusen.<br>
Alla tycks vara på väg någonstans.<br>
För dem är det vardag, en dag som igår.<br>
För mig är det overkligt, en ofattbar dröm.<br>
Men detta är Sverige, en fridlyst park<br>
ett prydligt ifyllt formulär i världens kaotiska konkursbo.</p>

<p>Men snart är jag hemma. Horisonterna sjunker.<br>
Sprickorna i välfärden blir åter synliga.<br>
Hemlösa och utstötta irrar i den fridlysta parken<br>
och det fattas uppgifter i det ifyllda formuläret.<br>
Här arbetar våldet och nöden under civiliserade former.<br>
Inga dör på gatorna och polisen sitter kvar i sina bilar.<br>
Därför har vi tid att vänta vid stoppljusen.<br>
Ännu så länge.</p>

<p>För inte är Drottninggatan en fortsättning på Istiklal<br>
Caddesi<br>
och vår välfärd en kamouflerad ofärd?</p>

<hr>

<p>Hörnet Kungsgatan-Vasagatan</p>

<p>Kritvitt ljus. Han står i gathörnet<br>
till hälften i skuggan.<br>
I handen hänger en resväska.<br>
det är hans enda tillhörighet.<br>
Bakom honom nu nervositeten, passkontrollen<br>
och de skickligt förfalskade identitetshandlingarna.</p>

<p>Borta nu de invanda landskapen<br>
de välkända tonfallen, vännerna, familjen.<br>
Aldrig mer en gata med egna landsmän<br>
vardagligheterna, gemenskaperna.<br>
Fyrtio år gammal föds han på nytt<br>
utan föräldrar, utan språk och rättigheter<br>
Men med ett minne som bränner av smärta och närhet.</p>

<p>Människor myllrar förbi honom<br>
upptagna av sina självklarheter.<br>
För honom återstår nu<br>
att göra sig av med sina<br>
och öva sig in i det okända som kallas frihet.<br>
Kritvitt ljus. Han står i gathörnet<br>
till hälften i skuggan.</p>

<hr>

<p>Just nu</p>

<p>Jag går här hemma i ett slags vana.<br>
Jag hittar i min våning, min stad, mitt liv.<br>
Marken under mina fötter ligger still.<br>
Förr drömde jag om att bestiga Mount Everest<br>
eller åtminstone Kebnekaise<br>
men nu håller jag mig mest nedanför trädgränsen.<br>
Vissa dagar kan det kännas så<br>
och hjärtat slår normalt och pulsen är jämn.</p>

<p>Men en dag upphör plötsligt vanan<br>
och fönstren i min våning blåser upp.<br>
Över en natt kan rummen växla plats, gator byta namn<br>
och marken börja skälva.<br>
Då galopperar hjärtat som en skenande häst<br>
och blodet störtar huvudstupa i mina ådror.</p>

<p>Jag trodde jag kunde säga &quot;mitt liv&quot;<br>
som om jag rådde om det och kunde bestämma över det.<br>
Men ingen rår om sitt liv<br>
Det är ett tillfälligt namn, en tillfällig ort<br>
där du just nu råkar befinna dig.<br>
Jag ser dig och talar till dig just nu<br>
men vet att jag varje stund föds i en ny viktlöshet<br>
och att vad som helst kan hända och händer.</p>

<hr>

<p>Som om undret fanns</p>

<p>Elden har brunnit ner<br>
men vi sitter kvar<br>
orörliga<br>
seende på varandra.</p>

<p>Kylan kommer sakta smygande.<br>
Jag ser att du fryser men kan ingenting.<br>
Jag är själv lika kall.</p>

<p>Du sträcker fram dina händer<br>
som fanns där ännu en osynlig eld<br>
och jag ör detsamma.<br>
Men det finns ingen eld.</p>

<p>Trots kölden sitter vi ännu en stund.<br>
Som om undret fanns.</p>

<p>Kväll på verandan</p>

<p>Likt en långsamt passerande kö<br>
rör sig vågorna förbi<br>
Jag sitter på verandan och iakttar dem<br>
Havets bilkö på fjärdens breda MOTORVÄG</p>

<p>på sommarutflykterna låg jag ofta i fören<br>
och såg hur vattner lockade sig kring stäven<br>
Aktersvallen från vår båt följde oss tätt<br>
som vågbarn rädda för havet<br>
Det var våra vågor<br>
medan dom andra fanns därute, vilda och främmande<br>
och när de ibland bröt sig in bland våra vågor<br>
och började riva i dem och slita sönder dem<br>
slet de också sönder något i mig, i oss</p>

<p>Men ikväll passerar vågorna lugnt förbi<br>
en stilla bilkö med släckta lysen<br>
Jag försöker följa en med blicken<br>
men förlorar den snart bland de andra<br>
Men det gör ingenting<br>
för det jag trodde var vågor<br>
ensamma och fyllda med liv<br>
är bara rörelser<br>
fortplantade i svart anonymt vatten</p>

<p>Sång till oordningen</p>

<p>Det är inte oordningen<br>
som hotar våra liv<br>
Det är ordningen<br>
Oordningen är alla möjligheters bördiga mylla<br>
Vattnet som strömmar och aldrig står stilla<br>
är oordning<br>
De virvlande fågelsvärmarna<br>
under himlen och i dina tankar<br>
är oordning<br>
Ordningen<br>
är själens ABAB-vakt<br>
som går runt och låser och släcker<br>
Det är ordningen<br>
som sänder sin likstelhet<br>
genom tankar och känslor<br>
Torkan<br>
som sätter sitt heta strykjärn<br>
där det nyss var grönt<br>
är ordning<br>
Den uttorkade flodfåran<br>
är ordning<br>
Blankettorden, de förväntade svaren<br>
är ordning<br>
Men ordet som plötsligt föds på dina läppar<br>
den hastiga beröringen<br>
den plötsliga insikten<br>
är oordning<br>
Kärleken som väcker dig och öppnar dig<br>
och som får dig att ta våldsamma steg<br>
ut ur ditt liv<br>
är oordning<br>
Din skrivande hand är ännu i rörelsen<br>
oordning<br>
men i samma sekund som bläcket stelnat<br>
sluter sig kring orden<br>
ordningen</p>

<hr align="left" width="30%">

<p>Frigörelse</p>

<p>När sorgens tunga lod<br>
hänger alldeles stilla<br>
i dig<br>
och de våldsamma krängningarna<br>
mellan hopp och förtvivlan<br>
avtar</p>

<p>hör du bara din egen andedräkt<br>
Allting är vad det är<br>
Ingenting gör anspråk på något annat</p>

<p>Som trädet<br>
gör sig i ordning<br>
för att utan skrymmande lövmassor<br>
möta den förestående vintern<br>
frigör sig <br>
livet<br>
ur din längtans tyranni</p>

<hr align="left" width="30%">

<p>Hållbart</p>

<p>Dikten<br>
är sanningens slipsten<br>
Om du vill ljuga<br>
håll dig till deklarationerna, resolutionerna<br>
Men dikten lurar du inte<br>
Sätt dina ord<br>
mot dess omutliga hjul<br>
och lögnerna svätter under dina händer<br>
Kvar blir endast<br>
det som innerst inne håller</p>

<title>Peter Curman - Lotta Strömberg: Nu flyger jag</title>
<meta name="FORMATTER" content="Microsoft FrontPage 2.0">

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<p><font size="6"><strong>Ur &quot;Nu flyger jag&quot; <br>
av pseudonymen Lotta Strömberg, 1980</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Lotta Strömberg föddes i ett TV-program som
hette &quot;Fäderneslandet&quot;, ett satirprogram som gick i
TV1 1980 och som gisslade olika svenska företeelser. Det var
året när den kämpande feminismen gick - åtminstone för en
tid - segrande fram i USA och i Europa. Eftersom
&quot;Fäderneslandet&quot; ständigt ville utmana den goda
smaken och allas vår rättrådighet bestämde sig redaktionen
för att testa de svenska förläggarnas trendkänslighet när
det gällde feministisk kamppoesi. Så föddes Lotta Strömberg i
en gammal Halda, som knattrade fram någonting som såg ut som en
diktsamling på bara några timmar. Därefter sändes manuset
runt till ett antal förlag. Efter ett par veckor började Mona
Nörklit, som på den tiden arbetade på vår redaktion, att
ringa runt. På Prisma fick hennes ljuva stämma napp.
Bokförläggare Stig Edling ville absolut träffa henne men Mona
upplyste honom om att Lotta tyvärr måste resa till en
kvinnokonferens i New York och inte kunde komma. Det kunde
däremot upphovsmannen till pseudonymen. Eftersom
&quot;Fäderneslandet&quot; avsåg att ta upp kvinnodikten till
granskning ombads bokförläggare Edling att i en filmad intervju
lufta sina åsikter om genren. I min mikrofon framhöll Edling
Lotta Strömbergs stora förtjänster. Eftersom jag var nära
förtrogen med Lottas poesi kunde jag lätt hålla med
bokförläggaren och även hjälpa honom med citat och andra
upplysningar om författarinnan. När poletten slutligen ramlade
ner och Edling insåg att han var utsatt för ett practicle joke
vidhöll han åndå sin höga uppskattning av Lottas poesi. Men
hans förtjusning delades inte av lektörerna på förlaget utan
diktsamlingen refuserades utan motivering. Den utomordentliga
tidskriften Lyrikvännen gav emellertid utrymme för Lottas
dikter och sedan tog jag med dem i min samlingsvolym
&quot;Fotspår&quot; 1986. Men det är först nu som Lottas
dikter får komma till sin fulla rätt i egen bok - tack vare
Print on Demand. En mycket onödig utgivning, tycker säkert
många. Just därför ska Lottas dikter ut. Alltid retar de väl
någon - vissa dikter ska nämligen vara som fiskben i halsen!</font></p>

<p><font size=7>People in a Landscape</font> </p>
<p><img src="images/andreas.JPG" align=right hspace=10 width=150 height=147>Maybe it<b> </b>is because of these difficulties of communication that we enjoy 
playing Chinese Whispers. This is a game where the participants are sitting 
at the end of the row and a person in the end of the row whispers a 
sentence to his neighbour who in turn poses it on to his neighbour etc. The 
person at the end of the row says the sentence aloud and it is totally 
distorted. Everybody laughs. </p>
<p>Why are we laughing? Presumably because we so easily misunderstand 
each other. The paradox is that we are united in this situation: we both produce and bridge the 
shortcomings of linguistic communication. </p>
<p>Here you can see an example of a similar game, but one I have made up. It is a kind of &#148;translation 
relay&#148;. A section of the Swedish poet Tomas Transtr&ouml;mer&#146;s poem &#148;Baltic Seas&#148; has been entitled 
&#148;People in a Landscape&#148;. This section, which was already translated from Swedish into French, was 
presented as an original French poem (&#148;Des gens dans un paysage&#148;) to an English translator. Then the 
English translation was presented to a Russian translator and then it was translated as an original 
Russian poem into Swedish. In the same way it was translated into Turkish, and on into French, English 
and so forth. </p>
<p>The original text is on a white background, the rest are blushing. </p>
<p>The poem by Transtr&ouml;mer is based on a photograph (&#148;&Aring;ngslupen Vikingen...&#148; ) In this regard this fact 
the orignal poem is in itself a kind of translation or interpretation from image to text. </p>

<p>Ni har tydligen hittat en lösning på att ge ut böcker,
även i små upplagor. Hur gör man om man vill bli översättare
av engelsk, norsk eller rysk skönlitteratur. Hälsningar

<p>Det är ett mycket bra initiativ ni tagit. Själv skrev jag en
bok för ett par år sedan i ett angeläget ämne. Jag har
upptäckt hur otroligt svårt det är att nå ut till bokhandeln
om man som jag tryckte upp och försökte distribuera själv.
Bokhandeln är inte intresserad och av de ca åttahundra böcker
jag sålt så har jag nog sålt ca 700 själv. Har ni någon
tanke på att även hjälpa oss som tagit steget fullt ut och
redan publicerat. Hälsn Ove PS Jag ligger ute på Internet med
mitt alster på hemsida <a href="http://hem.passagen.se/evoca/">http://hem.passagen.se/evoca/</a>

<p>A very goood initiative. But where are all the writers gone?
Maybe a provocative answer can be found in this interview with
Clifford Stoll. </p>

<p> [Image] </p>

<p> Cyber-Skeptic: Cliff Stoll </p>

<p> An interview with a born-again cyberhead who says maybe all
this electronic technology is resulting in information overload.
Perhaps we had best go back and find time to smell the roses. </p>

<p> by John Gerstner, ABC </p>

<p> 'Click.' Feather-weight Cliff Stoll, in the ring with
heavy-weight champion Mike &quot;Internet&quot; Tyson. Stoll,
weaving and bobbing . . . scrawny and long-haired ... stuns the
crowd as he lands a series of sharp blows to the head. </p>

<p> &quot;Computers dull the skills we use in everyday
life.&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;The Internet, that great digital dumpster, confers not
power, not prosperity, not perspicacity.&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;Why are drug addicts and computer aficionados both
called users?&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;Click.&quot; Cliff Stoll, astride his faithful donkey .
. . steadfastly flailing at the flotilla of Internet windmills
that dot the high Spanish plain of LaMancha. Gleaming white in
the moonlight, he can make out their perfectly lettered
nameplates: &quot;Enlightenment&quot; &quot;Prosperity&quot;
&quot;Utopia&quot; and he scoffs: </p>

<p> &quot;There is a technocratic belief that computers and
networks will make a better society. That access to information,
better communication and electronic programs can cure social
problems. I simply don't believe it.&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;Click.&quot; Cliff Stoll single-handedly gripping the
tether of a gargantuan Internet dirigible. It is crammed with
noisy Internauts, thrilled to be bound for the promised
Cyberland. Stoll grips the rope with all of his might, but the
incredible blast of hot media air finally wrests it free. As the
huge craft rises overhead, he shouts one last warning, which no
one onboard seems to hear: </p>

<p> &quot;Much of what happens over the networks is a metaphor --
we chat without speaking, smile without grinning, and hug without
touching. How sad to dwell in a metaphor without living the
experience.&quot; </p>

<p> So at a time when you can't pick up a newspaper or watch a
television commercial without confronting the word Internet --
and big Internet fish are eating the little ones -- Cliff Stoll
is the long-haired hippie standing beside the Great I-Way waving
a yellow caution flag and holding up a hand-scrawled sign that
reads: &quot;www. enough.already.&quot; Maybe it's high time. </p>

<p> Stoll's version of where the Information Superhighway is
taking us, and at what cost, is entertainingly packaged in his
1995 book &quot;Silicon Snake Oil: Second Thoughts on the
Information Highway.&quot; It is a conversational and witty
meditation on what Stoll believes are powerful and dangerous
Internet myths ... such as that electronic data exchange is
faster, more reliable and less expensive than communication by
phone, fax or even the postal service. And that computerizing our
schools and libraries will improve education. And that connecting
to the Internet is a wise use of your time. </p>

<p> &quot;Every minute spent on the Internet is one minute you
didn't spend with your loved ones,&quot; he says. &quot;While
you're connecting to the stranger on the other side of the globe,
you're not teaching your child how to draw.&quot; </p>

<p> Stoll's attack on cyber-life would be easier to dismiss if he
were simply another neo-Luddite smashing computers out of
ignorance or fear. But Stoll is more reformed technogeek than
technophobe. A planetary astronomer by training, he cobbled
together his first computer in 1976 and logged onto the Arpanet,
the ancestor of the Internet, soon after to share research with
colleagues. Even today -- on the World Wide Web he loves to
loathe -- he has a home page (<a
href="http://www.OCF.Berkeley.EDU/~stoll/)">http://www.OCF.Berkeley.EDU/~stoll/)</a>
where he advertises his books and apologizes for not answering
all his E-mail. </p>

<p> In 1989, Stoll helped make hyperspace hip with his
best-seller, &quot;The Cuckoo's Egg.&quot; It is a
revenge-of-the-nerd true tale of how he used programming wizardry
to track down a gang of German hackers that were stealing U.S.
security information and selling it to the KGB. The crooks had
cracked the computer system he managed at the Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., and it took Stoll a year to catch
them. </p>

<p> Stoll still lives (without a car or television set) in
Berkeley, which may partially explain his sunny '60s
sentimentalism. For all of us who've ever cussed a computer when
it crashed for no good reason, or simply felt guilty about
spending so much time online for so little, Stoll's views strike
a vibrant chord. Even though you can't help feeling Stoll's
cynicism is tongue-in-cheek at times -- and there's a sinking
feeling that we humans are probably powerless before the
onslaught of technology anyway -- Stoll's download of doubt rings
loud and refreshing: Enter the Internet with caution, and keep a
sharp eye on your rear-view mirror. </p>

<p> What tipped you over the edge . . . you didn't start out
being anti- computers, did you? Quite the opposite, I have always
been very intrigued by computers. I love technology. I love
computers. I own six of them. I've been using computers for 35
years. I'm on the Internet daily. I've been online for more than
two decades. I simply began to take note of the private doubts my
fellow computer jocks were voicing in the cafeteria and hallways.
Things like how frustrating, time-consuming and expensive it is
to keep hardware and software current and working. Things like
how the Internet promises so much, yet delivers so little. </p>

<p> What kind of reaction did &quot;Silicon Snake Oil&quot; stir
up in Silicon Valley? To my astonishment, the commentary from the
computer field has been small; the commentary from the wider
field of readers has been considerable. I've gotten a lot of
reaction from teachers, librarians, and those who are critical of
the runaway growth of the Internet. They agree the Internet is
being grossly oversold. And that it's high time to ask why. </p>

<p> How have the media treated you? One article called me a
techno-traitor, a traitor to technologists. Another said I'm just
in it for the money, trying to publish the first anti-Internet
book. Neither of these is correct. I'm simply trying to keep the
field honest. We need skepticism. </p>

<p> The resistance to criticism reminds me of the arrogance of
nuclear engineers in the 1960s when they said, &quot;Trust us, we
know what's good for you. We will give you low-cost, high-quality
electricity.&quot; </p>

<p> You're not saying there are dangers to the Internet equal to
the dangers of nuclear energy? Oh no ... I'd say it's much closer
to the promises and reality of a highway system in the 1970s. The
argument then was that high-speed roads would be good for the
country, good for the cities, good for farmers, good for defense.
They will bring us closer to one another. All of these promises
are similar to promises of the Internet. But no one asked the
obvious question: Might this highway system be bad for the
country? Might it create a civilization where people waste hours
everyday commuting because they have moved to the suburbs? Might
the highway system make the U.S. dependent on foreign oil? </p>

<p> Similar grand promises were also made for television in the
1940s. They said it will inform and entertain us; it will make us
a closer nation. It will be good for the family by providing a
place for all of us to gather in the evening. These promises are
also surprisingly similar to the promises made for the Internet.
The reality is that television has helped devastate society. But
no one asked the obvious question: Do we want or need television?
</p>

<p> Do we have the choice of accepting or rejecting a new
technology? Doesn't it just get thrown into our laps, and we
don't find out its ills until much later, when it may be too
late? This much is certain: Unless we debate these questions in
public, we move blindly. We listen to some cyberguru who says
this is the way the future is, close your eyes and trust me. I
don't believe in gurus. I believe in skepticism, in discussion,
in public debate. It's our responsibility as citizens, as
technologists, to debate where this stuff is likely to go and to
ask difficult questions. </p>

<p> The easy questions are things like, &quot;How will we deliver
mega bandwidths into people's homes?&quot; That's a technical
question. The tough question is, &quot;For what purpose will this
be used? Will this actually help people's lives or will it be
used for interactive Nintendo games? Will 500 channels of
television give people a better lifestyle or might it be better
to spend this money on books for libraries? Do people genuinely
need and desire T-1 bandwidth Internet or might it be more
important to spend that money on forests? On preserving parks? </p>

<p> &quot;Is our vision of the future that of virtual communities
or friendly neighborhoods where people know their neighbors and
work together?&quot; To me those are important questions. Maybe
it's more important for me to spend time with my aging parents
than to spend time prowling around the World Wide Web. Accessing
100 home pages is 60 minutes that I could be spending teaching my
daughter how to draw. </p>

<p> What are your biggest concerns about our move toward
cyberspace? That the Internet is a terrifically effective way to
waste time that might otherwise be difficult to waste. I spend
almost as much time figuring out what's wrong with my computer as
I do actually using it. Networked software, especially, requires
frequent updates and maintenance, which gets in the way of doing
routine work. </p>

<p> Why are workers no more productive now than 15 years ago?
Might it be that the time you save with a computer is exactly
taken up by the time needed to maintain and use the computer?
Could it be that E-mail is offset exactly by the time wasted by
the time spent to make the damn stuff work? </p>

<p> I'm also very concerned that the Internet is promoted as a
great educational tool when in fact it is a way of avoiding
learning about logic. That the Internet is promoted as a way to
meet people, to bring us closer together, when in fact it
isolates us from one another. It puts me in contact with distant
strangers while taking me away from my neighbors, my friends, my
family. This is as obvious to you as it is to me. I have spent an
hour online without realizing that all of the people who are
important to me were gone. </p>

<p> But I'm sure you agree there is some value to electronic
communication. We're able to do this interview over the phone,
for instance . . . This interview would be much better and far
more memorable for us both if you came over to my house and had
coffee. By talking over the phone, it's less personal, less
memorable, less fun. If we were to conduct this interview over
the Internet, it would be even more boring. </p>

<p> It depends on how fast a typist you are, to some degree. Yes.
One effect of the Internet is to undermine quality journalism and
substitute shallow reporting. It's much easier for a reporter to
just fire up the Internet and search on a keyword than to call
someone up on the phone or dig for substantive information in the
library. </p>

<p> What do you make of the growing number of online
publications? You keep hearing people say whoever can supply
content will make money on the Internet. I no longer believe it.
One of the more pernicious myths is that the Internet will prompt
a literary revival. The computer is not something that promotes
reading for more than a small amount of text. Second, you can't
bill people for stuff on the Internet. One of the dirty little
secrets of the Internet is that users are remarkably cheap. Even
if you could bill them, users are not willing to pay a nickel.
Result? It's a terrific way for unpublished science fiction
authors to get their works out, but is it a good way for a
magazine to publish serious editorial content? Heck no! And if
the advertisers don't get anything out of it, the whole thing
goes away. </p>

<p> But many people are making money on the Internet, right?
There is no question that some people are making a small amount
of money from the Internet, such as Internet service providers.
But Internet content providers are not. The Internet is based on
people trying to get something for nothing, and I don't think you
can. It violates the first law of economics . . . mainly, there
ain't no such thing as a free lunch. </p>

<p> What's your assessment of the quality of information on the
Internet? If you like television, you will love the World Wide
Web. Instead of having 200 or 500 channels, the World Wide Web
provides 100 million channels. The Web alongside television makes
people think they are getting information when in fact they are
getting low-quality data. And there is a wide gulf between
information and knowledge. Knowledge means understanding; you
can't download understanding from an FTP site. The World Wide Web
may provide lots of answers, many of them wrong. </p>

<p> One of the lies of the Internet is that it is an information
superhighway and that we need lots more information. But I have
never met anyone standing on a street corner, sign in hand,
saying we need more information. Just the opposite, many of us,
especially those of us working in technical fields, say,
&quot;I've got all the information I need. Give me less, but give
me higher quality information.&quot; And that's what's missing
from the Internet, quality. When it doesn't cost anything to post
the stuff, people naturally post anything they wish. As a result,
when I need quality information, I turn to that which is
published on paper for the obvious reason that it costs money to
publish on paper. Because of that, there is a built-in filter.
They are called editors. Because it costs money, they will only
allow that which has quality content. So when I want quality, I
look on a piece of paper. I look at that which has been edited.
And that's what is grossly and desperately missing from the World
Wide Web: editors, critics, reviewers, reporters. </p>

<p> You're really addressing the audience of this interview now.
There is a real ferment in communicator ranks about what to do
with the new technology. Are we supposed to abandon print and
jump to the online world, and if so, how do we do it with
quality? The answer to me is self-evident. It's economic. You get
what you pay for. When it's cheap or free to publish something on
the World Wide Web, you will naturally publish that which costs
the least, has the least and has the least economic value. If you
have a catalog or parts list, you put it online. When you have
something you want people to study and think hard about, you'll
put it on paper. Quality writing takes time. Somebody who puts
time and money and effort into it . . . are they going to give it
away for free? Maybe, but I doubt it. </p>

<p> Unfortunately I think companies are finding that it's not
exactly cheap to put words on the Internet either. They are
pricey, but that will go down. They'll nosedive real soon. Around
here there are college students putting businesses online for
U.S. $2,000. Businesses paying thousands of dollars to have big
web sites are wasting their money. </p>

<p> &quot;Silicon Snake Oil&quot; very passionately argues for
living in the real world rather than the virtual world. It's
strange that this distinction would even need to be brought up,
but it does seem valid to remind people that when you are on the
Internet, you have left the real world. And you are escaping into
nowhere. I don't want to stick my head into some kind of an
ostrich hole. I want to deal with real people, real experience. I
want to taste and feel and see and hear and touch what is around
me. I want real human interrelationships. When I read all these
newspaper reports of this coming virtual reality world, I roll my
eyes and say, this is bogus. Computers teach us to withdraw, to
retreat into the warm comfort of their false reality. No computer
can teach what a walk through a pine forest is like. Sensation
has no substitute. </p>

<p> But yet you admit you are a heavy and long-time Internet
user. I am a long-time user, but I am no longer a heavy user. I
might be online for a few minutes a day. I am not saying the
Internet is worthless. I'm saying we need to be skeptical of the
claims made for the Internet. When people say the Internet is
useful, nail them down. Say &quot;useful for what?&quot; When
people say it is essential, say &quot;essential for what?&quot; </p>

<p> I gave a talk in Silicon Valley and this guy came up and he
said, &quot;I find the Internet to be infinitely valuable.&quot;
I said, &quot;I'm an astronomer . . . you don't use the word
infinite around me, guy.&quot; And he said, &quot;Nope, it's
infinitely valuable to me,&quot; When I asked, &quot;what
for?&quot; he said, &quot;I'm a bicyclist and I keep up to date
with the French Tour de France by reading postings on the
Internet.&quot; </p>

<p> I thought he was going to tell me he discovered the cure for
his sister's cancer on the Internet. No, his definition of
infinite value was that he could keep up to date with a bicycle
race. I told him if he really wanted infinite value, he should go
to France and watch the race in person. </p>

<p> Better yet, instead of spending time with your hands on the
keyboard, spend your time with your hands on the handlebars . . .
go bicycling. You'll learn a lot more about bicycling, and you'll
be a better athlete for it. Time that you spend on the Internet
is time that you are not spending bicycling, feeding your fish,
chatting with your neighbors, talking to your spouse or working
on your relationships. </p>

<p> Another point you make clearly in your book is that the
torrent of information that flows through the Web makes us
terrifically overloaded, and even splinters our thinking. Do you
think we are actually devaluing words here? The medium in which
we communicate changes how we organize our thoughts. We program
computers, but the computers also program us. I rarely sit back
and contemplate what's on my screen. It's too immediate, too
demanding, and the next file is pressing. </p>

<p> It's like drinking from a firehose. You get plenty wet, but
still walk away thirsty. Every day, well over a hundred megabytes
of postings flow by -- far too much to even skim, let alone read.
I get glassy eyed from reading innumerable postings that have
nothing to say -- a vast echo canyon, endlessly repeating calls
from people who want to hear their own voices. </p>

<p> The ability to read and reflect upon a long document is being
lost because people expect multimedia, ritzy, multicolored,
icon-driven pretty pictures. We are losing the ability to read,
reflect and analytically report on what one sees. Quite the
opposite, television coupled with multimedia gives us a sense
that all you have to do to learn about something is to see a
fancy CD-ROM complete with video clips and soundtrack. Well, I
don't believe it. Learning requires much more than seeing
something. Learning requires homework, discipline, commitment,
responsibility. Learning requires work. It requires a good
teacher. Those things are antithetical to multimedia. </p>

<p> I know many term papers today are being written by cutting
and pasting off the Internet. Sure . . . open up a lousy
encyclopedia like Encarta, copy and paste a section onto my term
paper. Result . . . poor writing, or worse . . . believing the
myth that all one needs to do to write is to copy from someone
else's work and paste it into yours. We need not think
analytically; we'll find somebody else who has done a similar
paper and paste it into ours. </p>

<p> What else do you think the Internet is hurting more than
helping? I look around the San Francisco Bay area, and
essentially every school district and high school teaches some
form of computing. As a result, I can hire a computer programmer
for $30 or $40 an hour, sometimes $50. None of the schools around
here teach plumbing. As a result, when I hire a plumber, Roto
Rooter charges $120 an hour. Now I can get along quite well
without a computer for a week or a month, but when my toilet
backs up, I'm desperate. Yet nobody knows what to do because we
are losing the skills that we no longer value. </p>

<p> You're also concerned about the problems of archiving
information electronically. Why? Because electronic media aren't
archival. The physical medium isn't the problem; it's the reading
mechanism. Think of the extinct formats: 78-rpm records, 2-inch
quad-scan videotape, phonograph cylinders, paper tape, 80-column
punch cards, 100-column punch cards, 7-track digital tape,
reel-to-reel audio tape, 8-track tapes, 8-millimeter movies. And
today: 45- and 33-rpm vinyl records; 51/4 inch floppy disks;
Betamax tapes. To which do you entrust your cultural heritage --
Mead Data Central or 10,000 libraries across the continent? </p>

<p> Do you have a vision of how all of this may wind up in the
next five years or so? No, I don't. I'm an astrophysicist, I
don't predict the future. One of the things I find offensive
about computer people is their willingness to try and predict the
future. With no training in sociology or humanities, they feel
they can go out and say what our society will look like in five
or 10 years. Instead of predicting the future, I observe the
present. </p>

<p> How would you describe yourself if you had to pin a label on?
A Luddite? Oh no, no, no, could a Luddite fix computers? Would a
Luddite typically wire his own printed circuit boards? Would a
Luddite take apart a disk drive on a Sunday evening? No. </p>

<p> How about curmudgeon? Nor am I a curmudgeon. I am not
cynical. I feel it is important to be skeptical, but not cynical.
I have hope for the future. I look forward with optimism, but I
am cynical of claims made for the future. I'm an astronomer and a
physicist and as such I am paid to be skeptical. </p>

<p> And you wind up being ambivalent about the Internet? Yes,
deeply ambivalent. I'm not afraid of technology. I love the
technology, but I distrust the claims made for it. </p>

<p> Does your long experience with the Internet make your
criticism of it more credible? I'm not sure about that. Suppose
an English professor who never used the Internet said the exact
same thing I did based upon his analysis of sociology and
television. Would that make his analysis invalid? People think
that because I am a technician I should understand the social
impact. That's a little bit like asking the cameraman at a TV
station how television would change our society. The right person
to ask about television would be a Latin scholar. In that sense,
you're asking the wrong guy. I'm the TV repairman. </p>

<p> Are you amazed how fast the Internet has grown just in the
last year without any real discussion about the effects of this
technology? No, the people who are building computers want to
sell them. The people who are making multimedia yearbooks want to
say they're revolutionizing the world. People who want to talk
about cyberspace want to say they're building a whole nation.
Well, I don't believe it. </p>

<p>This is a burningly important article. I read Clifford Stoll's
book as well, and highly recommend it. </p>

<p> The issues I would like to put forward is that of true
internet publishing, i.e., edited, publishing of high quality
prose and poetry. Publising that can match that of print in
relevance and quality. </p>

<p> How do we achieve it? How do we replace books? Do we want to
replace books? </p>

<p> I think the Internet is the perfect forum for the aspiring or
even established writer, but how do you &quot;get heard&quot; in
the galaxy of noise? </p>

<p><em>Ett smakprov:</em></p>

<p>Utnötningskriget rasar för fullt. Det gäller vem som orkar
härda ut längst i det arktiska känsloklimat som nu råder
mellan oss. Ann är som förbytt. Eller annars är hon för
första gången sig själv på allvar. Hon kommer och går som
hon vill. Hon anser sig inte ha någonting med mig att skaffa
längre. Själv går jag rödgråten genom dagarna. Av och till
sätter sorgkrampen in. Jag tänker på självmord. I badkaret
med Gilletteblad. Eller på att falla överbord från en båt.
Eller på att samla på Mogadon i tillräcklig mängd. Om inte
Linda fanns skulle jag redan ha gjort det. Jag är ju hjälplöst
förlorad i detta ställningskrig eftersom jag inte kan
stålsätta mig. Jag är fjättrad vid henne. Det fanns en tid
när jag kallade denna bundenhet för kärlek. Nu är den mitt
gissel, mitt kval. Det vet hon. Hon vet att hon när som helst
kan vissla på mig och jag gör henne till lags. Detta övertag
ger henne en otrolig säkerhet och nonchalans.<br>
- Du får hämta Linda på dagis, säger hon i samma ögonblick
som hon smäller igen dörren bakom sig. Och jag hämtar Linda.
Ylva har också tagit efter hennes beteende.<br>
- Har du tvättstugenycklarna? frågade jag när hon kom hem en
stund på lunchen. Utan ett ord tog hon upp dem ur jeansfickan
och kastade dem på golvet. Sedan skrek hon:<br>
- Fan, jag står inte ut med dig för helvete! Ann skulle inte ha
kunnat göra det mer övertygande.</p>

<p>Ann och Ylva har sin pakt och deras gemensamma mål är att
driva mig ut ur lägenheten. Genom utfrysningskampanjer och rena
otidigheter. Men Linda har de inte fått med sig i sitt hat. Milt
och tåligt stryker hon mig över kinden, säger:<br>
- Stackars pappa. <br>
Jag biter ihop tänderna, men kan inte hejda tårarna. Jag vill
ju inte att Linda ska vara den vuxna av oss. Som om hon läst
mina tankar säger hon plötsligt:<br>
- Nu ska du läsa Bamse för mig.<br>
Och jag läser. Vi lägger oss först i hennes säng och slevar i
oss av dunderhonungen. Och sedan går vi upp till mitt rum för
Linda vill somna i min säng. Hon lägger sin lilla arm över
mitt bröst och viskar:<br>
- Nu ska du sova så att du blir glad igen!<br>
Och jag känner att hon har samma trollmakt över mig som Ann.
Fast Linda vill mig väl. Hon vill att jag ska bli glad och stark
som Bamse så att vi kan åka till Krokholmen på söndag.
Krokholmen är vår sommarö som Linda älskar och Ann hatar för
att hon inte står ut med att vara beroende av mig och båten.
Men vi har talat om att åka dit ut för att göra upp om hur vi
ska ha det. Hur Ann ska ha det. Men Linda gläder sig åt den
planerade utflykten. Hon tänker på de röda och blå
plastankorna i boden. Jag lovar henne att försöka bli lika
stark och glad som Bamse.<br>
När hon somnat går jag ner och låser med övernyckeln så att
Ann ska bli tvungen att ringa på dörren för att kunna komma
in. </p>

<h1><a name="the tower of babel">the tower of babel</a></h1>
<p>We had devised a new means of communicating <br>
In spite of the tongues that had got into a tangle <br>
And we had finished erecting the tower of Babel <br>
And it was tall and well placed and at the right angle </p>
<p>When I don't know how everything began to sway <br>
And he himself thought it was high time he came round <br>
To us up there and tangle the tongues once more <br>
But there was nothing left to tangle he found. </p>
<p>For we all spoke the same tongue <br>
I mean we would say the same thing each and all <br>
And he quietly watched us yell out the same word <br>
Which had absolutely no meaning at all. </p>
<hr>
<h1><a name="i cannot complain">i cannot complain</a></h1>
<p>I cannot complain of hunger <br>
All my food comes from heaven free <br>
But I'm afraid for the god <br>
That will have to feed on me. </p>
<p>I'm too dark and I'm too sad <br>
And my offering might seem <br>
Even leaner than it is <br>
Even bitterer to him. </p>
<p>In a lovely poppy field <br>
He could well my life blood pour <br>
While my flesh could well be kept <br>
To be shared among the poor. </p>
<hr>
<h1><a name="prayer">prayer</a></h1>
<p>Oedipus the king was led by the hand by his daughter Antigone <br>
King Lear by Cordelia, the one chased away <br>
From the kingdom for allegedly not loving him enough <br>
I could lead you, father, any day </p>
<p>As for me, I don't know if there will be anyone <br>
To accompany me in that hour most horrible <br>
When everything will be hidden to my eyes <br>
Us all I well know that it will be impossible. </p>
<p>O God, do not try to blind us all at once <br>
Take only every second man and delay the end <br>
Of the tragedy a little. Let everybody <br>
Have someone to lead him slowly by the hand. </p>

<h2><A HREF="gambit.html">opening gambit</A></h2>
<!--text here-->
<IMG SRC="chess.gif" 	WIDTH=61 HEIGHT=47 ALIGN=left>

Welcome to February's free-for-all, a lark-about for readers with brains.  We call this literary monthly <b>george jr.</b> and, if I were you, I'd start with the <A HREF="gambit.html">introduction to the issue</A>, but it's your move. And don't you think it's time to put away the rub-on tattoos?



<P> 


<h2><A HREF="wideman.html">with john edgar wideman</a></h2>

<!--text here-->

   Rarely has the intimate relationship between author and reader
been explored more challengingly than it is in <b>The Cattle
Killing,</b> John Edgar Wideman's 13th book, and his first novel in
six years.<p>
  <P>


<h2><A HREF="olsen.html">lance olsen q &#38; a</a></h2>
<IMG SRC="icarus.gif" WIDTH=126 HEIGHT=124 ALIGN=right hspace=10 vspace=10>
<!--text here-->

<A HREF="http://www.uidaho.edu/~lolsen/">Lance Olsen</A>, Idaho
Writer-in-Residence and Philip K. Dick Award finalist for best science
fiction of 1995, is author of four novels, including <b>Tonguing the
Zeitgeist</b>, two short story collections, and six critical studies,
including the first book-length one about cyberpunk godfather <A
HREF="http://www.vkool.com/gibson/netindex.html">William Gibson</A>. 
Read on, landlubber.
<br clear=all>
<P>

<h2><A HREF="atwood.html">with margaret atwood</A></h2>

<!--text here-->
   Eleven years after she imagined a harsh authoritarian society
of the future in <B>The Handmaid's Tale</B>, the Canadian novelist
Margaret Atwood has turned her attention to an actual crime from
the past that poses more questions and riddles than it answers. Here she discusses her new novel, <B>Alias Grace</B>.<P>
<P>

<h2><A HREF="carson.html">on anne carson</a></h2>


<!--text here-->

Throughout  Anne Carson's <b>Plainwater</b>,  one hears the hyper-conscious, critical mind of an author with a powerfully clinical intelligence. You want to know what's the next big thing? It's Anne Carson.

<h2><A HREF="federman.html">the uneasy chair</A></h2>

<!--text here-->
The esteemed writer Raymond Federman - novelist, translator, literary pioneer - says the whole shebang has gone to heck in a handbag. And what are we going to do about it?

Well, the problem has been put; but will
                       monkey buttons solve a thing? Heck
                       no. (That's two hecks, and you're
                       counting.) This wee diversion will send
                       you on a scavenger hunt inside
                       george jr.'s brain. Warning! Graphic intensive. 
Wear galoshes and slap on the pithy helmet. 


<P>

<H2><A HREF="wh1.html">white house email</a></H2>

<!--text here-->
Instead of alerting you to <a href="http://www.msn.com">Microsoft Network's</a> plans to  launch new RIFF technology and live chat with <a href="http://www.msn.com"> Phillip Glass from Feb. 7-13</a>, <a href="http://www.msn.com">Jan Silberry from Feb. 14-20</a>, <a href="http://www.msn.com">Love Mongers from Feb. 21-27</a> and <a href="http://www.msn.com">Keith Emerson from Feb. 28-March 6</a>, we instead offer you a surly roundup of genuine dispatches to and from the White House that were sent during those glory years of Oliver North, Iran-Contra and the whole White House mess. That, my friends, is entertainment.

<H2><A HREF="grayson.html">panty hose wars</a></H2>

<!--text here-->
From underwear to underlings, has <b>george jr.</b> no limits? Frankly, no. In this dispatch from attorney Richard Grayson, we can see how the high courts continue to uphold our leggings, er, rights.

<br clear=all>
<p>

<H2><A HREF="baker.html">a poem</A></H2>
<!--text here-->
OK, your daughter may marry a restaurant, but would you want one moving in next door? David Baker offers  a tonic by way of a poem.

<h2><a href="kitty.html">ask kitty</a></h2>

February's advice from our unleashed cat's meow of a columnist. Don't even <b>think </b> about getting her fixed. Where would we be without her. (Well, <b>lost</b> leaps rapidly to mind.)
<P>

<h2><a href="npr/npr.html">national public rodeo</a>
<IMG SRC="horn.jpg" WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=65 hspace=10 vspace=10 ALIGN=left></h2>
<!--text here-->
We finally had a moment to reorganize our noteworthy links - and added about 30 more - at this month's newsstand for digerati. If you're a writer, you'll want to Bookmark the page; if you are a reader, Macolyte, IBMer, or a human being of adventurous sorts, you'll want to play their tunes. Until we realize our plans to build a <b>george jr.</b> theme park, this will have to do.

<P>
<h2><A HREF="austin.html">letter from austin</A></h2>
<IMG SRC="cowboy3.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=138 hspace=5 vspace=10 ALIGN=right>
Jeanne Claire van Ryzin reports on a city that never rides side-saddle. Listen, and don't be timid about trying those additional links, especially while listening to Orchestra Was' <b>Forever's a Long, Long Time</b>. If you decide Austin sounds too good to be true, move there and see for yourself. And take this <A HREF="austin.html">link</A> with you.

<P>
<h2><A HREF="keywest.html">letter from key west</A></h2>
<IMG SRC="snorkel.gif" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=134 hspace=5 vspace=5 ALIGN=left>
<!--text here-->
Not content to merely present a basket overflowing with seasonal delights, Patrick A. Lennon continues his observations from our Southernmost city, where bombs burst in air and bums burst sometimes on the sidewalks. Check the temperature there, and feel crummy that you're somewhere else.

<br clear=all>

<P>
<h2><A HREF="spam.html">green eggs and spam</A></h2>

<!--text here-->
They roll in, in waves of green and each one of them accompanied by the sound of a million bee wings. Some are curious, others cool; all are uncooked. We're sticking a couple of headshakers in here each month. In none of them is the word "postmodern."

<h2><a href="back.html">back-issue generator</a></h2>
<!--text here-->
Literature is news that stays news," said that old cracker Ezra Pound. And we hope with this internet monthly, too. Take a look at the <a href="back.html">back-issue generator</a>, where most of this zine is archived and annotated.<br>

<b>george jr.</b> is a monthly literary 'zine -- call it a boxcar, a kazoo, a 
magazine, whatever you like -- ever so devoted to literature, the 
national obsessions, fiction and news, sometimes, about the 
software and entertainment biz.
<p>

<b>george jr.</b> consists of views, frequently an artist's portfolio and 
news, much of it sent to our world headquarters via its faxline 
(614-899-9011), which usually <B>george jr.</B> remembers to leave turned on 
during the day before he heads to work.<BR>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5 color=red>What george jr. wants</FONT><BR>
</CENTER>
Editorial copy from you, for which we can pay neither a shilling nor a pence. <b>george jr.</b> is especially interested in Interesting Info smartly conveyed, and also original essays, short-short fiction and even reprints (which we secure permission to reprint, always, and for which we neither pay nor charge a dime). Especially coveted: columns on music and film.<P>
And he wants to keep his birth name.

<p>

<b>george jr. </b> finally has a scanner, so kindly send your art or prints, but not slides, which require more technology than I have. Send letters as <A HREF="mailto:jr@georgejr.com">email</A> or disks, via snail mail, to <B>george jr.</B>, Box 2962, Columbus, Ohio 43216-2962 (US of A).

Welcome to the February issue of <b>george jr.</b>, the internet monthly 
that takes only "Well, uh, OK, yes" for an answer.<P>



So, what's your question?<P>


Well, what's in this issue? News of another fieldtrip to Lilac Valley, 
N.Y.? Or what my  grandfather might more than once said?<P>



Well, this is not a technological slag heap, I assure you. Nothing that 
buzzes or pings. Nothing about chat groups. No music here, Bubba. Nothing 
about  <A HREF="http://www.backweb.com">Backweb</A>, <A

Well, why not?<P>

Because, my little cookie-head, <B>george jr</B>. is about words and 
people. You want to chat ? Use the telephone. You want to see an animated 
face? Knock on your neighbor's door at 3 a.m.  Wanna hear some tunes? 
Turn on your CD player, ferheavensakes.<P>

<!--IMG SRC="weber.jpg" WIDTH=137 HEIGHT=220 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=right-->

No, it's content that is king at <B>george jr.</B>, which this month 
includes features on the novelists <B>Margaret Atwood, John Edgar 
Wideman, Lance Olsen</B> and a clarion call from<B> Raymond Federman</B>. 
Oh sure, we'll play with you a bit - in <B>monkey buttons</B>, for 
example, because the humanoid was born to tinker and to try and raise a 
grin - but all the while we'll tilt you back to words, news, literature 
and info. <B>Ask Kitty</B> advises, gently, on how you might revise your 
life. <P>
 As always, there is more: <B>Patrick A. Lennon</B> offers the news from 
Key West.<B> Jeanne Claire van Ryzin </b>reports, blithely, on the  
Austin Lyric Opera, now entering its 10th season.  <b>Richard Grayson

Next month: The battle for PEN; all-mighty paradigms; a report from 
Habitat for Humanity  in Africa; interviews with three incredible writers 
worth your time; a pinch of pepper; a jot of zany; updates from live 
wires everywhere.
Meantime, ploughshares and popcorn to all. <P>

<h2>john edgar wideman: from time to time in africa</h2>
<br>


<P>



<b>by nicholas a. basbanes</b><br>
<br><br>
 <hr>
<blockquote>

   Rarely has the intimate relationship between author and reader
been explored more challengingly than it is in <b>The Cattle
Killing,</b> John Edgar Wideman's 13th book, and his first novel in
six years.<p>


   As  Wideman's audaciously inventive new work opens, an unnamed novelist
is traveling through the rough and tumble African-American
neighborhood of his youth to visit his aging father and to read
aloud for him the manuscript from his work-in-progress. The time
is the present, and a sense of moment is implied:<p>

  <IMG SRC="wideman.jpg" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=220 HSPACE=10 vspace=10 ALIGN=left>

 "He would read to his father. Or offer to read. His father
not an easy man. He'd read from the new manuscript if his father
in bedroom slippers, hunched on the couch, swaddled in blankets
against the chill, was willing to listen. And will that
listening, if it happens, be part of the story, the beginning of
what he reads."<p>
   From there, <B>The Cattle Killing</B> (Houghton Mifflin, $22.95), races back more than 200 years to Philadelphia
and the summer of 1793, when an epidemic of yellow fever erupted
in the city, causing fear and chaos among all residents. <p>
   The voice quickly becomes that of an 18th-century black
preacher who has the gift - or curse, depending on your point of
view - to see worlds within worlds, layers within layers. He
arrives in Philadelphia to help his people during these trying
days of confusion, dread and abandonment, and encounters a young
African woman carrying a dead baby who thereupon will consume his
attention.<p>
   A constantly mutating tale, seemingly told to an unidentified
listener, <B>The Cattle Killing</B> encompasses many places and time
periods, and draws sustenance from a multitude of sources, many
historic, many mythic, many legendary, many imaginary. There is
no conventional plot to summarize simply, a circumstance made
clear by the assertion early on that the book is "not exactly a
novel."<p>
   The title derives from an old story about an African tribe,
the Xhosa, which destroyed its livestock as a ritualistic way of
ridding itself of European domination, only to find that the
prophesy being followed was false, and what resulted instead was
continued suffering.<p>
   In an epilogue, Wideman shifts once again to the present, with
an appreciative letter, apparently written by his own son,
offering yet another take on the special alchemy that transpires
between readers and writers. The young man, on his way to visit
Africa, has just read <B>The Cattle Killing.</B><p>
   "Perhaps this was his father's gift to him," the adult son,
also a writer, muses. "Pops setting the table, providing the
ingredients, inviting people to the feast, but leaving the final
preparation of the meal for him."<p>
    From these disparate reference points, it is clear that
Wideman seeks out a variety of responses to his writing, and he
expects his readers to participate in the creative process. "I
don't want the reader to get away too easily," the  55-year-old
author agreed in a recent interview.<p>
  "Good writing centers itself right in the middle of that
special relationship between two minds. I like to push that edge,
and explore that edge, and the writing I like best centers itself
in this process. Good writing creates a space between the mind of
the reader and the mind of the writer. This thing that writing
produces enacts itself somewhere in the middle of that space."<p>
   Despite this conviction about not letting readers "get away
too easily," Wideman nevertheless includes in his books what he
calls a "warning label," a statement of literary intentions no
different than a fairy tale that begins with the phrase, "once
upon a time." <p>
   "I make it pretty clear at the outset that this is going to
bea different kind of novel," Wideman said. "I make it pretty
clear that there are certain stylistic things that I'm going to
do, certain things with grammar and punctuation, and there are
certain things the reader has to do too. Part of the fun for me
is to find for each book or each story a special way to tell
it."<p>
   Born in Washington, D.C., Wideman grew up in a black
neighborhood on the east side of Pittsburgh known as Homewood,
which he has used often as a setting for his writing. A Phi Betta
Kappa graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, where he was an
All Ivy League forward on the basketball team, Wideman won a
Rhodes Scholarship in 1963 -  the second African-American to be so
honored - and studied 18th-century literature at Oxford
University.<p>
   Wideman's first novel, <B>A Glance Away</B>, was published four
years later, when he was 26 years old. He has twice won the
PEN/Faulkner Award, the first in 1984 for <B>Sent for You
Yesterday,</B> and again in 1991 for <B>Philadelphia Fire</B>. His
1994 memoir, <B>Fatheralong</B>, was a finalist for the National
Book Award. <p>
  Wideman's earlier memoir, <B>Brothers and Keepers,</B>
compellingly explored the divergent circumstances that led his
younger brother, Robert, to be convicted of murder and imprisoned
for life, and helped him achieve success as an author and
teacher. It was a finalist in 1985 for the National Book Critics
Circle Award.<p>
   Although he has been a professional writer for three decades,
Wideman said he finds special pleasure in teaching. He has held
positions at a number of prominent institutions, and is now a
professor and associate dean of the faculty of the Humanities and
Fine Arts Department at the University of Massachusetts in
Amherst.<p>
    "Teaching writing is fun, because you see the process
working with younger people," he said. "It also happens that
I'm a guy who grew up with nothing, and I always want to know
I've got the security of a day job."

<H3>lance olsen: pop goes the zeitgeist

<IMG SRC="olsen2.jpg" WIDTH=168 HEIGHT=154 HSPACE=10 vspace=10 ALIGN=right>
<A HREF="http://www.uidaho.edu/~lolsen/">Lance Olsen</A>, Idaho
Writer-in-Residence and Philip K. Dick Award finalist for best science

<br clear=all>
<hr width=80%>



<font size=5>q. </font>Critics have often associated your work with the
so-called <A HREF="http://www.uidaho.edu/~lolsen/AP.html">"Avant-Pop"</A>.
Is this a comfortable literary fit for you?
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font>So-called is right.  The term, first appropriated
several years ago by critic Larry McCaffery and surfictionist Ron Sukenick
from a Lester Bowie jazz album, suggests a mode of expression that splices
the avant-garde's obsession with innovation, experimentation, and

<IMG SRC="olsen.jpg" WIDTH=142 HEIGHT=220 HSPACE=10 vspace=10  ALIGN=left>

radicalization with a deep pop sensibility.  The result: an extreme fusion
and confusion of the traditional distinctions between "high" culture and
"low."  But if we think about this definition for a second, we realize
we've just defined postmodernism...nothing, in other words, that hasn't
been around in one guise or another for the last three or four decades.
<P>
I wonder, then, whether the A-P doesn't have more to do with a marketing
strategy than a literary one...with a generation of writers, in other
words, lacking socio-historical context who need to feel what they're doing
is new and thus important.
<P>
At the same time, I'm intrigued with the notion, adore many of the writers
that have been associated with the term (William Burroughs, Thomas Pynchon,
Kathy Acker, Mark Leyner, and David Foster Wallace, for instance) and
certainly agree my work displays some of the A-Ps concerns and obsessions.
<P></P>
<font size=5>q. </font> Is the Avant-Pop just another literary Flavor of
the Week, then?
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font>Not exactly.  I'm as wary as the next guy about
Flavors of the (Literarily) Weak.  At the same time, I'm also aware that
labels are nothing but shorthands for organizing reality, narratological or
otherwise, and hence helpful.  The alternative would be a sort of paralytic
intellectual schizophrenia.
<P>
So if you'd like to attach one to me, I'm comfortable enough with
Avant-Pop, but I'd probably feel a bit more so with something like <A
HREF="http://www.armory.com/~jay/convulsive.html">"Convulsive Beauty,"</A>
a lovely phrase first coined by Andre Breton in his surrealist manifesto,
and which, for me, suggests a socio-historically aware alternative
aesthetic mode that thinks back through a hypothetical trajectory of
vanguard art, appropriating from the past while nibbling always forward,
from the fifties, sixties, seventies, eighties, and nineties: through
Avant-Pop, Surfiction, Metafiction, Punk, Cyberpunk, RiboFunk, the
Multimedia Moment, the Deconstructive Turn, the Novel of Excess & Regress &
Digress, Language Poetry, Beat fiction, Faction, Magical Realism, the
Nouveau Roman, the New Wave, and so on, back through Lettrism, Surrealism,
Dadaism, Expressionism, Decadence, Imagism, Vorticism, Futurism, and
Symbolism...and back again, finally, to the doorstep of that paradigmless
paradigm of Romanticism committed to the idea of Convulsive Beauty (think
of Blake's visions, or, better, of the presence of Frankenstein's
monster--the latter an appropriated, electrocuted, existentially and
socially and epistemologically alien icon of the extreme instant in the
arts) with its thematics and formalistics of trespass, revolution,
Dionysian border-breaking, psychotic breach, brilliant rage, paranoid rant,
with its exploration of the illogical, the unconscious, the inner-world,
the drastic aesthetico-spiritual brink experienced by the Aztec sacrifice
who wants his heart to be removed because of what he'll see and feel.
<P></P>
<font size=5>q. </font> In other words, a fairly accurate description of
your new novel, <A HREF="http://www.uidaho.edu/~lolsen/famine.html"><I>Time
Famine</I></A>, a dark-edged satiric science fiction in the tradition of
William Gibson's <I>Neuromancer</I> and Anthony Burgess's <I>A Clockwork
Orange</I>.
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font>Exactly.  Satire as a literary genre supposes a
fairly strong moral impetus (think of Jonathan Swift or Kurt Vonnegut), an
impetus to disturb the reader out of his or her complacency, and <I>Time
Famine</I> is no exception.  It may at first seem to launch sorties on lots
of attack-points, but really there are only three major ones: 1) the
ignorant manhandling of the environment for short-term economic gain at the
risk of long-term spiritual loss; 2) the televisualization of reality in
the late twentieth century and its concomitant disruption of selfhood's
stability; 3) the fact that the American west--and, by implication, the
rest of the country--has really progressed a lot less over the last
hundred-and-fifty years or so than it believes it has.
<P>
All of these concerns organize themselves around a thready plot:  this
Disney-like corporation has bought the rights to the great atrocities of
history and built theme parks around them.  Hence Belsenland, the Iron
Curtain, and so on.  The nuclear reactor in one of these parks suffers a
meltdown, releasing a cloud of radiation over the southwest. The fallout
affects the population's sense of time, causing an outbreak of "intense
memory" (which may or may not be real memory) in many people. One of these,
Uly Sysop-of-the-Plains Stray, begins to slip, or hallucinate he's
slipping, into the nineteenth-century pioneer world of the ill-fated Donner
Party.
<P></P>
<font size=5>q. </font>Why choose to work in science fiction, a genre many
think is literarily low-rent?<br>
<font size=5>a. </font>People who think SF is somehow "low-rent" haven't
read Mary Shelley's <I>Frankenstein</I>, one of the really great novels to
arise out of the early Industrial Revolution, and in many ways the mother
of all science fiction texts.  They haven't read some of the finest
practioners: J. G. Ballard, Richard Kadrey, Lewis Shiner.  There's lots of
terrible, terrible stuff being written under the banner of SF.  Absolutely.
But there's also lots of terrible, terrible stuff being written under the
banners of realism, fantasy, experimental fiction, you name it.
<P>
Science fiction's a genre that re-presents our world to us through a
narrative glass darkly so we can see it anew, treating our present as
someone else's past.  It's the most forward-thinking literary genre we
have, and one that thus lends itself to thinking about Big Questions, as
opposed, let's say, to domestic psychological realism, which lends itself
to thinking about Small Questions.  SF asks us to think about tomorrow,
about global and universal matters, and warns us what might happen if we're
not careful, what might happen if we are, and hence is usually the only
genre that addresses questions about such important issues as the
development of nanotechnology, bioengineering, artificial intelligence, or
virtual reality.
<P></P>
<font size=5>q. </font>You've called <I>Time Famine</I> an "anti-sequel" to
<I>Tonguing the Zeitgeist</I>.  How so?
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font> I think of the two novels as companion pieces.
They don't share characters, and they don't share plot components, but they
do share the same world, and they do share many of the same themes.  So if
someone picked up <I>Time Famine</I> expecting to find a continuation of
<I>Tonguing the Zeitgeist</I>, someone would be disappointed.  But if
someone picked up <I>Time Famine</I> expecting to find an elaboration and
continuation of <I>Tonguing the Zeitgeist</I>'s world and vision (<I>Time
Famine</I> is set fewer than ten years ahead of <I>Tonguing the
Zeitgeist</I>), then someone would be content.  Hence the idea of the
anti-sequel.
<P>
There's nothing to my mind more tedious than a writer who repeats him or
herself, and so I always promise myself not to do the same thing twice.
Ick.  You might as well just thin the herd if you plan on doing that,
narratologically and creatively speaking.
<P></P>
<font size=5>q. </font>You're a critic as well as a fiction writer.  How
does one enterprise converse with the other?
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font>My understanding of contemporary fiction and theory
continually informs my creative work.  <I>Time Famine</I>, or the novel I
wrote just before it, <A
HREF="http://www.uidaho.edu/~lolsen/burnt.html"><I> Burnt</I></a>, are rife,
for instance, with fictional manifestations of Baudrillard's idea of the
evaporation of reality in the late millennium and Guy Debord's of ours as a
society of the spectacle.
<P>
My understanding of the writing process continually informs the way I
approach texts when exploring them analytically as well.  Last year and the
year before I had a great time close reading Nabokov's <I>Lolita</I>,
composing an almost scene-by-scene explication, which I just don't think I
could have done justice to without knowing fiction from the inside out.
<P></P>
<font size=5>q. </font>Speaking of the late millennium and forward-thinking
modes, what do you see happening to American fiction during the next decade
or so?
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font>New York publishing will continue to exclude, given
its seedy economic motivations, and thus it'll be harder and harder for
young writers to break in and mid-list writers to stay in.
<P>
That's the bad news, and bad it is.  The good news is that smaller presses
will continue to multiply, if not be all that economically fruitful, as
will interesting and important literary sites like this on the web.
<P>
So there will be 250 channels and everything on.  That's what makes this
moment so capitvating.  We've moved at every level--televisual, literary,
theoretical, you name it--from a this-ism or that-ism toward an any-ism, an
all-ism, a kaleidoscopic hypertext hotel, a high-tech garden of forking
paths.  Down one you might find gay fiction, down another neohumanist or
regionalist or metafictionist or feminist or politically incorrect or Asian
American or, better yet, all of them at some network once.  Diversity,
whether subatomic or cultural, may well be old news from an old front from
an old war.  We're moving toward a Unified Field Theory of culture, a
gesture that open-armedly <I>includes</I>, gobbles up, termites along,
without ever homogenizing.  It's a multimedia moment, and one that's really
exciting to be a part of.
<P>
Unless, of course, you're writing for fame or money, in which case you
should hurry along and do something else, and never look back.

<H2>margaret atwood: lizzie borden's tale</H2>

<BR>


<B>by nicholas a. basbanes<BR></B>
<BR><BR>


   Eleven years after she imagined a harsh authoritarian society
of the future in <B>The Handmaid's Tale</B>, the Canadian novelist
Margaret Atwood has turned her attention to an actual crime from
the past to create an absorbing novel that poses more provocative
questions and riddles than it answers.<P>
<HR>
<blockquote>
<IMG SRC="atwood.jpg" WIDTH=204 HEIGHT=264 HSPACE=10 vspace=10 ALIGN=right>

   There is no conventional way to classify <B>Alias Grace</B> (Talese/Doubleday, $24.95), Atwood's 41st book and
ninth novel, although it certainly borrows from several literary
genres, historical fiction, the murder mystery and the Victorian

thriller among them.<P>

  "It is not a murder mystery, it is a mystery about a
murder," the 56-year-old author made clear during a recent
interview."In a murder mystery you have to come up with the
solution, or the readers will rise up against you. You can't just
end it by saying, 'Well, I don't know.'"<P>

   The salient point to make in this context is that if Atwood
has any firm opinion about what actually happened in the matter
of Grace Marks more than a century and a half ago, she has no
intention of letting on now, either within the pages of her book
or in conversation.<P>

   Providing a premise for <B>Alias Grace</B> are the fragmentary
facts surrounding the double murder on July 23, 1843, of Thomas
Kinnear, a wealthy Ontario land owner, and Nancy Montgomery, his
housekeeper and pregnant mistress. <P>

   Convicted of the brutal crimes were James McDermott, Kinnear's
manservant, and Grace Marks, a 16-year-old serving girl rumored
to have been romantically involved with her employer. McDermott
was hanged on Nov. 23, 1843, protesting to the end that the
murders had been Grace's idea, although he had given numerous
other contradictory accounts of just what had happened.<P>

   Grace gave authorities several conflicting stories of her own,
one of which may have persuaded a jury to believe her insane and
to pronounce a sentence of life imprisonment, not death by
hanging. Also arguing in favor of sparing Grace's life were her
age and her sex.<P>


    But vexing doubts persisted: Was Grace, as she claimed, James
McDermott's hapless victim? Was she a scheming conspirator? Or
was she insane? These central questions have remained unanswered
for decades, and gave Atwood all the background she needed to
frame a multi-layered work of speculative fiction that goes well
beyond the boundaries of a "whodunit."<P>

   Atwood's interest in the case was sparked by the 19th-century
writings of a woman named Susanna Moodie, an English emigrant who
wrote a number of books about life in Canada, including one in
which she described two meetings with Grace Marks. One of these
took place in the Kingston Penitentiary, the other was conducted
in the Toronto Lunatic Asylum, where Grace stayed briefly.<P>

  "I wrote a television play for Canadian television in 1974
about Grace called <B>The Servant Girl</B>, but I used only one
source, the one provided by Susanna Moodie, which I thought at
that time to be completely accurate," Atwood said. <P>

  "As it turned out, her version was seriously flawed. When I
realized that people have been fictionalizing this story from the
word go, it became interesting to me as a novel. They all had
their biases, they all had their own slants, they took sides. It
was like the Lizzie Borden case here in the United States."<P>

   For her work on this novel, Atwood became a scholar,
researching not only every piece of information she could find
about the trial, but material that revealed how people lived and
thought in 19th-century Canada, and material that gave insight
into pre-Freudian concepts of mental illness.<P>

   One of the characters Atwood created for the novel is Dr.
Simon Jordan, an American physician whose studies in unconscious
mental processes lead people who believe in Grace's innocence to
retain his services. <P>

   Dr. Jordan's meetings with Grace take place in 1859, when the
novel is set. The novel is presented alternately from their
points of view, with Grace narrating her version of events in the
first person, and Dr. Jordan's in the third. The interaction
between the two characters is an essential element in the novel,
and contributes measurably to Atwood's clever resolution.<P>

 "As a fiction writer, it helps me a whole bunch that so much
remains unknown," Atwood said."One ironclad rule I imposed on
myself was that if there was a clear fact, I couldn't change it.
It's a bit of game theory I have about the process. It's not real
if you cheat. But where there are no facts in the record, I give
myself the freedom to invent."<P>

   Citing one example, Atwood said that it would have been
wonderful for her purposes if Grace had been present at
McDermott's execution. "The date he was hanged is known, and
Grace was already in the penitentiary. That would have been a
pretty dramatic scene, watching this person that you may or may
not have been having an affair with, that you may or may not have
helped to kill somebody, dying. Too bad for me."<P>

   In the end, however, it was the continuing uncertainty about
the case that Atwood found most appealing. "The things that
interest me were not necessarily the things that would have
interested somebody writing about the case then. I'm interested
in the ambiguities. They were interested in the certainties,
which they made up even if they were not available."<P>

   Readers who seek parallels between <B>The Handmaid's Tale</B> and
<B>Alias Grace</B> will find Atwood's continuing concerns with
women's identity and domestic relationships, giving each book a
contemporary resonance.
   "We cannot help but be contemporary," Atwood said, quoting
her distinguished countryman, the late Robertson Davies. "No
matter where we set our books, or when we set them, we can't help
it. All fiction is about when it is written. And it happens that
I'm a late 20th century person."

<H2>muddying the waters</H2>
<BR>

	<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=4 CELLPADDING=4>

<TR VALIGN=Top>
<td><FONT SIZE=4><B>Plainwater, </b></font size=4> by Anne Carson, bears the subtitle "Essays and Poems."  One can't blame her table of contents for not distinguishing the two.  In this five-part collection, prose passages are often lyrical descriptions of subjective experience, while the verse lines tend to shoulder the analytical weight. <P>
 What interests Carson, however, is not formal distinctions, but the possibility of breaking down genres; in her title, and is as essential as essays or poems.  She succeeds in that--at the books most riveting moments -form is truly an instrument, a language in itself and not merely a justification.  At times original and haunting, Plainwater is weakest when written to challenge our conventions for the sole sake of experiment.<P>

	What unifies<B> Plainwater</B> is hard to say.  "The Anthropology of Water," which fills the last 138 of the book's 260 pages, seems complete in itself.  This section is comprised of three parts, each a journey reported in the form of a journal.  The first is a pilgrimage taken by Carson and a man she refers to as "my Cid" to Compostela, Spain.  The second is a cross-country drive taken with "the Emperor of China."  The third concerns her brother, who will, we're told, eventually disappear into a series of postcards sent from ever more exotic places and finally silence.  <P>

	Throughout "The Anthropology of Water," one hears the hyper-conscious, critical mind of an author who is, nonetheless, dependent upon her subjects and unable to dismiss them with a clinical intelligence.  In Lawrence, Kansas she writes:<BR>
<blockquote>

Enlightenment is useless but some of its principles are not--for example, unconventionality.  This means if you see someone struggling, help him don't ask what the object is.   A million maggots in a silk hat, says classical Chinese wisdom.  The emperor likes the idea of making love to women fitted with false penises.  I try not to neglect anything that is part of him.  It is rather like watching somebody die. (page 203)
</blockquote>
Each journey has its inevitable disaster.  The role of intelligence is to deny the disaster, to qualify it, to disarm it, while still documenting its approach.  These are frightening, moving narratives whose author never flinches before their blows.<P>

	But this tone is not sustained throughout the book.  In fact, it is only achieved at the end.  <B>Plainwater</B> rushes from the cerebral poetics of "Mimnermos: The Brainsex Paintings" through the jargony academics of "Canicula di Anna" to end on the lyric and elegiac prose of "The Anthropology of Water," the book's high point.  Though her virtuosity is evident in each case, its necessity is not.  This is most true in "Canicula di Anna," which chronicles a convention held in Italy and allows itself such banal commentary as:<BR>

<blockquote>
Famous phenomenologists of tutta l'Italia
have foregathered here.
They take things back to the sophists
then climb the stone stairs
for a heavy lunch.
Their foreheads are not so tall
as the foreheads
of French phenomenologists
but they are much more good natured. 
(page 53)
</blockquote>
A reader hears Stevens' rationalists in their square hats, but "good natured" is far more sterile than "sombreros."  Though one may wonder what hats acrobats or grave diggers may wear, this poem does not lead a reader to ask about the foreheads of Dutch or Chinese phenomenologists.<P>

	The other two sections, "Short Talks" and "The Life of Towns," are the collection's most successfully experimental works, synthesizing form and content.  "Short Talks" is comprised of 31 short prose poems, usually less than one hundred words written in school-house blocks which attempt to frame the lunging logic she brings to such subjects as hedonism, waterproofing and walking backwards.  She has this to say on the  Mona Lisa:<BR>
</blockquote>

Every day he poured his question into her, as you pour water from one vessel into another, and it poured back.  Don't tell me he was painting his mother, lust, et cetera.  There is a moment when the water is not in one vessel nor in the other--what a thirst it was, and he supposed that when the canvas became completely empty he would stop.  But women are strong.  She knew vessels, she knew water, she knew mortal thirst. 
(page 37, line breaks inexact)
</blockquote>
	"The Life of Towns" maps 36 "towns" such as "Apostle Town" or "Town of Greta Garbo."  Each town is written in lines which begin with a capital and end on a period, no matter how the sentences fall, foregoing all other punctuation.  In sections such as "Town of the Sound of a Twig Breaking" this fragmenting effect intensifies the language around it:<BR>
<blockquote>

Their faces I thought were knives.
The way they pointed them at me.
And waited.
A hunter is someone who listens.
So hard to his prey it pulls the weapon.
Out of his hand and impales.
Itself.
(page 104)
</blockquote>
	Carson is a classicist by training, and one not only senses her admiration of broken jars and half tablets, but comes to share it when her fragments reveal glimpses into elliptical, revelatory truths which would be buried by the whole.  One is tempted to say that is exactly what happens to this book's best parts: They are smothered by the dull. <P>
 <B>Plainwater</B> is frustrating as only something which rises to daring heights can be. Fortunately, in this collection the good does out-weight the bad, though stricter editing would have kept the scales at bay.  Three of its sections, most of the book, are not only wonderful, but unlike anything you've read.  It's other two sections read like several things you never bothered to finish.<P>

<H4>a manifesto (of sorts):</H4>
<BR>
<h2>the real begins where the spectacle ends</h2>
<B>by raymond federman</B><BR>
<BR clear=all>


<BR>

<hr>

What are the forms of representing the world that today parade before us?  The cynical or frivolous precipitation of the spectacular, the triviality of trash-TV or the obscene tautologies of TV docudrama into which the real subsides without a trace.  Now, and without any doubt more than ever, the derealizing flux of media images runs away with our powers of discernment, our conscience, our lives, and of course our writing.  It forces us to surrender to what can only be called, in a strict sense, the fabulous and
seductive grasp of spectacle.  It bars us from a simplified representation of the real.  It educates us in the dazed distrust of what is there in front of our eyes -- those eyes that have been overfed with icons.  But despite our embittered submission to the charm of these icons, despite our willing servitude to the spectacle, we know very well that it is all false,  that it is nothing but a theater of shadows that exhausts our sense of the real in its emptiness, and teaches us nothing, nothing but a mythology custom-made
for a new breed of savages.
<BR>
<BR>

But the world is far more complex, far more chaotic, far more confusing, far more inaccessible than the false images we are offered daily.  And the experiences that create the world for us are far more complex, chaotic, confused and confusing than THEY think.  By THEY, I mean those who falsify OUR WORLD for us.  OUR WORLD -- the one we as writers deal with everyday -- is a static-filled screen, a fuzzy image agitated by emotions a hundred times more voluptuous, but also a hundred times more painful than those THEY are trying to make us feel.  Even the quickest move on the remote control cannot relieve us of the vertiginous bombardment of information to which the world subjects us.  Its space is infinitely more profound, more decentered, more polymorphous.  And the time which we spend in its flow never aligns itself according to the monochrome scenarios that supposedly symbolizes its passage.
<p>
<img src=federman1.jpg width=202 height=163 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=right>
How to react?  How to reply?  How to write today the world in which we live and write?  How are we to symbolize differently and more truly (I did not say, more realistically, but more truly) our experience of the world?  It will most certainly not be in the mode of an easy, facile, positive literature written in an industrial high-tech prose, it will not be a
literature which has sold out to the Spectacle whose rich territory it wants to enter by any means, by compromise or by prostitution, but especially through simplistic cynicism, or with an ostentatious kitsch.  This pseudo-literature, which is becoming more and more drab, more and more banal and predictable, more and more insignificant, functions beyond the pale of our anguish and desire.
<p>
When literature ceases to understand the world and accepts the crisis of representation in which it functions, it becomes mere entertainment, it becomes part of the Spectacle.
<p>
What is the antidote to this unreflexive and lazy precipitation of what still pretends to be literature?  It is the kind of writing that resists the recuperation of itself into distorted or false figures and images.  The kind of literature we need now is the kind that will systematically erode and dissipate the setting of the Spectacle, frustrate the expectation of its positive beginning, middle, and end, and cheap resolution. This kind of writing will be at the same time frugal and denuded, but rhetorically complex, so that it can seize the world in a new way.  This kind of writing must create a space of resistance to the alienated devotion to images -- to the refining and undermining of the world by images.  This kind of writing should be like an ironic free tense within the opacity of the Spectacle.
<p>
Anyone who persists in doing literature without acceding to the fact that doing literature can only be an intra-worldly diversion, a career path, a subjective confession, anyone who does not assent to the idea that literature can have no possible social impact, is today urgently confronted with the lacerating questions?  What end does it serve?  What good is it?  What meaning, in the world and for the world, can the pursuit of this activity have?  An activity that society has definitely marginalized, an activity
reduced to a sort of deliciously and pleasantly outmoded form of survival, an activity performed beyond the bounds of serious self-reflection.
<p>
When literature becomes a surplus of culture, a supplement of culture, it can no longer call itself literature.  When fiction becomes a product which can be bought in supermarkets next to the tomatoes, then it no longer deserves to be called literature, or even to be created.
<p>
But now one must ask, is it possible for fiction, for the serious writers of fiction (I assume there are still a few writers among us who think of themselves as serious writers) -- is it possible for these writers to escape the generalized recuperation that is taking place in the marketplace of books?  Is it possible for fiction to survive the kind of reduction, the kind of banalization that mass media imposes on contemporary culture?  Is it possible for fiction to escape the way publicity and advertising ingest and digest culture?  Is it possible for fiction to survive the hypnosis of marketing, the sweet boredom of consensus, the cellophane wrapping of thinking, the commercialization of desire?  In other words, can fiction escape conformity and banality and yet play a role in our society, have a place in our society?  And finally, are there still people out there willing to turn their backs on the SPECTACLE and find time to write and read works of
fiction?  These are urgent questions that demand immediate answers.

<blockquote>
<H2>white house e-mail</H2>

Thanks to our friends at the National Security Archive, Tom Blanton and 

The New

Press, <b>george jr.</b> is able to bring you, raw and unplugged, 

genuine-article, top-secret

messages - from Blanton's book, White House E-mail - that the Reagan/Bush 

White

House tried to destroy. 

<P>

We'll bring you several of their actual email messages a week, until heck freezes over,  without editorial gloss.

<P>

<A HREF="whtech.html">Techies</A> will want to know: These messages are scanned ASCII  text files on DOS-formatted disk (edited by Blanton, produced by Ian Stevenson with technical gizmonics from John Martinez).

<P>

In case you've forgotten--here's a <A HREF="whwhowho.html">who's who</A>, the rogue's gallery from the Reagan-Bush years. And for those, who like us can  barely remember what we had for breakfast, here's a <A HREF="whchron.html">chronology</A> of  White House events.

<P>

Let's jump right in.....

 DONALD FORTIER<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>NOTE FROM: Walter Raymond</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>SUBJECT: Afghan Hum&Ouml;anitarian Assistance</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>   I expressed concern at the ODSM on Thursdayregarding
a sentence in a restricted handling STATIS cable which said: &quot;Apart
from AID, most people within the administration dealing with Afghanistan
are prepared to consider a Pakistani role which would include
a large measure of control by ISI if that is necessary.&quot;
This is in reference to cross border humanitarian operations (CBA).Such
a statement simply is not true.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>   Such a policy does not reflect USG policy.
As you are well aware there are several reasons why we should
extend humanitarian assistance openly: (1)No gain in using covert
means if not needed; (2) the Hill and the body politic want to
do something to help the Afghans and channeling their efforts
toward humanitarian assistance is consistent with the popular
mood and is certainly better than getting the body politic involved
in clamoringfor expanded lethal&yacute;; (3) expanded humanitarian
assistance also permits us to work with European PVOs and to expand
the overall Western interest. This in turn translates out as greater
pressure, higher cost, to the Soviets</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>   There is a deep suspicion of VOLAGS within
AID and a ritualistic desire to have a formal organization to
work with in Pakistan. Typical AID mind gridlock. Hinton has not
helped because he to wants a more structured relationship. The
Paks from their side do not want a structured relationship, although
they do want to maintain control. And, as you know, are pretty
disinterested in our direct dealings with the Afghan Resistance
Coalition.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>   At any rate, whether unilaterally from
the Paks, or through maladroitism from the US side in Pakistan
or whether through Jujego asserting his perks and muscles it appears
that the Paks may also have second thoughts about  humanitarian
aid and may prefer an ISI channel.  I think it is essential that
we resist this and that we seek to find a way to do the job consistent
w&#179;ith Pak sensitivities. [One line deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption]
Zal believes we should continue to provide support to the Volags
on a business as usual basis until the Paks create some sort of
a &quot;front&quot; which they will probably do in the near term.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>   Recommendation: Call Armacost and have
him resist the idea of funneling humanitarian assistance thru
ISI. We need to think imaginatively and act flexibly tomake operational
arrangements which will permit this program to go forward. Avoid
over- bureaucratizing a situation and forcing the Paks to say
yes or no when they would just as soon look the other way.(FPO:

<FONT COLOR=#000000>SUBJECT: Mtg w/Don Gregg re NSDD</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>John D. and I met with Don Gregg and staff
this afternoon to brief them on the contents of the NSDD implementing
Packard.  We started by giving them the background to formation
of the Commission, what's happended during the past year, and
where we are headed in the immediate future.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>         </FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>It was immediatedly apparent that Don was
more interested in the political dynamics than the detailed issues
of substance.  (For example, he wanted to know how John Lehman
fit in.)  In response, we tried to put the Commission's activities
in an historical context: these are the right issues for the President's
second term; not intended as criticism of SECDEF, but rather presents
unique opportunity; need to regain high ground from Congress,
etc.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>         </FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Don is interested in carving out a special
role for the VP, and s_ettled on the idea that the VP should go
talk to the President and offer to help the President work through
these tough issues with SECDEF.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>         </FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>He is apparently convinced (and rightly so)
that if the Packard implementation is not successful the VP will
certainly inherit the public's negative image of defense management
in 1988.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>         </FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>We urged Don to talk this through with you
prior to having the VP raise these issues with the President,
and he indicated that he would do so.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>SUBJECT: State screw-up on FON</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Early this morning, State sent out a Secret
Libyan threat alert to all posts on heightened threat of Libyan
terrorist attack based on possible reaction to US ops in Gulf
of Sidra.  It contained the additional unclass version: &quot;The
US has initiated new freedom of navigation operations in the Gulf
of Sidra.  Libyan leader Qadhafi has previously threatened to
attack US targets if US ships crossed the 32-30 line.  The US
is concerned that Libya may undertake terrorist action against
US personnel or facilities as a form of reprisal.&quot;  THIS
IS EXACTLY OPPOSITE OF GUIDANCE FROM YESTERDAY'S ARMACOST MEETING.
 Raphel reports message was not cleared by either Oakley or S/S,
and was sent out by INR without checking.  State is changing procedures,
but damage is done.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>  I recommend strong phone call to Armacost
asking who's in charge at State.</FONT>

to send me a note on Monday or so about the prognosis for the
dialogue with the Iranians. I would also appreciate your sense
of things. I have the impression that they have recurrent (and
understandable) disagreements over this channel and also are no
doubt arguing over the signifigance of our raid. But if expect
to get a &quot;go&quot; this week I will need to cancel some things
and get replacements so do give me a heads up when you can see

<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>SUBJECT: Good Results on Proposed Teicher/Shirin
move</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>I spoke to Howard Teicher and he was in favor
of the move and asked that it occur immediately.  Howard was very
pleased about the positive effect that moving Shirin into the
suite would have:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>  - Coordination of the workload would be
improved</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>  - Howard could brief Sairin on different
areas/actions in the        Directorate, thus making the transition
a smooth one when he leaves upon Dennis Ross' arrival in May</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Also, a discussion followed in which all present
agreed with the decision to move Shirin into the suite:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>  - Shirin's placement in the suite is wise
because she has            institutional knowledge of the NSC;
 it would prove beneficial to the directorate to have Shirin close
by to assist in the transition of both Dennis Ross and the third
staff member who will both be new to the NSC staff</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>- Also, the old NSC motto of &quot;He who
suffers the longest should g&thorn;et the best location&quot;
was totally supported</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Shirin has agreed to the move taking place
this week.  She has pointed out that she will assume the telephone
lines already in suite 348 to assure continuity of the directorate.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>I will coordinate the movement of Shirin's
furniture/safes into Howard's present office.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Howard will use most of Covey's present furniture,
so I will move Howard's furniture (with his permission) into Suite
392 into Shirin's present room.  Therefore, Ollie North's team,
Mr. Earl and Coy, will be able to have a place to work right next
to Ollie until they move to their new location in Room 302 in
May.  (Same timeframe as the Teicher move into Suite 392 when
Ross comes on board.)</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Reference secretarial support:  There are
presently two secretaries in room 348 They will stay right where
they are and support Teicher and Shirin.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Shirin's secretary BJ should be back to work
full time when Teicher and his secretary move down to room 392.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Joan Vail will continue to support Steve Sestanovich
at her &#178;own request. She enjoys working with him and has
requested that when she moves into the Secretariat to work for
Van that she keep Steve's telephone line with her and continue
to provide secretarial support for Steve.  Thus, Steve as a senior
director, will have one person designated to take care of his
phone, scheduling, mail pickup, and the limited typing support
that he requires.  (This has been coordinated with Steve Sestanovich
and he is in total agreement.  Steve pointed out that he really
does not require typing support and that Joan would perfectly
fit his support needs)</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>I do not expect BJ to return to work for another
week or so. When she does come back, it will be on a part time
basis and we will arrange for a temporary work space in room 348
for BJ until Teicher and his secretary, J. Murphy, move to Suite
392 when Ross comes on board. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>By that time, BJ should be back to a full
time work schedule.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>If all of this sounds ok t&Ograve;o you, I
will forward this note to the people involved with the move.</FONT>

Cap taold me that David Martin apparently had a copy of it. Cap
was complaining about the memo - not its contents but the fact
that it was put on paper. I turned the argument around and told
him the real concern was that it leaked. Do not distribute other
copies and let's deny the existence of any approved paper. Other

<FONT COLOR=#000000>in recent weeks, we have seen indications
that another eruption of violence in aden is likely. the best

leaving us little ground to plow as far as they are concerned.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>however, no one sitting in washington should
believe that we can genuinely appreciate yemeni politics without
first hand contact and serious analysis. to that end, shireen
and i encouraged state to try to think creatively in advance of
crisis regarding how we might shape and/or take advantage of renewed
violence and political instability in aden. significantly, shultz
has also been pressing nea to come up with some ideas--so far
to no avail according to the dasd creekmore. however, now that
we have proposed some specific operational ideas, nea intends
to take another look at the problem for shultz. at a minimum,
we believe it is essential for us to consult with the saudis and
yemenis now to stimulate their thinking, let them know we are
remain willing to cooperate, and try_ to position ourselves to
weaken the soviets in aden when the fighting resumes.</FONT>

<H2>great moments 
 in panty hose jurisprudence</H2>

<td><FONT SIZE=4><B>As a staff attorney</font></b> and Visiting Assistant in Law Research at the 
Center for Governmental Responsibility at the College of Law at the 
University of Florida here in Gainesville, I was the recipient in 
October 1995 of a $47,500 grant from The Namath Foundation to study 
changing legal attitudes toward undergarments.  Perhaps the most 
fascinating subject of my research centered on one of the most recent 
innovations, panty hose.<P>


    Many times since the invention of panty hose, American courts 
have been called upon to make momentous legal decisions involving 
this item of clothing.  These decisions should be of interest to the 
lay public as well as to legal scholars.  Herewith I would like to 
present the following rulings as the most crucial.<P>


    (Those wishing to acquire the full 270-page report I presented to 
the Foundation on January 15, 1997 -- only seven months late -- may 
write to<A HREF="mailto:GRAYSON@LAW.UFL.EDU">me</A> for ordering information.)<P>

<IMG SRC="hose1.jpg" WIDTH=123 HEIGHT=97 vspace=10 hspace=10 ALIGN=left>
    In a groundbreaking 1969 opinion that marked the first federal 
appellate court ruling on the subject, the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the Second Circuit decided a trademark dispute between a manufacturer 
that planned to bring out a line of panty hose with the Kiki label 
and the holder of the Kiki trademark for a line of tights.  On the 
basis of the evidence presented, the court found that panty hose and 
tights were not equivalent because panty hose show the leg through 
the material while tights are opaque and can be worn as outerwear.  
The ruling in Kiki Undies Corp. v. Promenade Hosiery Mills, 411 F. 2d 
1097 (2nd Cir. 1969), set the tone for future federal court opinions.<P>

    
    For example, following the precedent of Kiki Undies, seven years 
later the Fourth Circuit held that a patent covering a "combination 
panty and stocking" was in fact describing what has come to be known 
as panty hose.   However, it was the court's judgment in Tights, Inc. 
v. Acme-McCrary Corp., 541 F. 2d 1047 (4th Cir. 1976), that this 
patent did not cover all such garments but was restricted by its 
terms to those panty hose constructed with a single U-shaped seam 
running from front to back through the crotch area and having no 
intervening crotch-piece.<P>


    More recently, in another civil action, Kocienski v. City of 
Bayonne, 757 F. Supp. 457 (D. N.J. 1991), a federal district court 
judge in New Jersey ruled against the plaintiff, the administratrix 
of the estate of her sister, who committed suicide in the Bayonne 
Municipal Jail by hanging herself with her panty hose.  The court 
found that decedent's death was not the result of negligence on the 
part of jail personnel, who had failed to remove her panty hose when 
they took her earrings, shoelaces, and a gold chain prior to her 
incarceration.  <P>


    In contrast, a federal judge was called upon to interpret a 
contract dispute between two parties in Doral Hosiery Corp. v. Sav-A-
Stop, Inc., 377 F. Supp. 387 (E.D. Pa. 1974).  The court held that a 
provision regarding amortization applied to all the defendant's panty 
hose, not merely those bearing the Sheer-to-the-Waist label.<P>


    Panty hose has also been the subject of prominent criminal cases. 
 Early on, in a 1975 prosecution for larceny, State v. Carter, 211 
S.E. 2d 813, 24 N.C. App. 688 (1969), the Court of Appeals of North 
Carolina upheld the defendant's conviction, ruling that the trial 
court was not in error when it permitted a witness to testify 
concerning the value of four cartons of panty hose which had been 
stolen.<P>


    In another appeal from a criminal conviction, Stoppleworth v. 
State, 501 N.W. 2d 325 (N.D. 1995), the Supreme Court of North Dakota 
found that defendant's counsel was not ineffective in the testing of 
a pair of panty hose to determine whether a foot had been cut off 
while wearing the garment.  The court noted that it was evident from 
the testimony that there were strategic and tactical considerations 
in the attorney's decisions regarding the panty hose and upheld the 
conviction.<P>


    However, based on testimony that witnesses could not ascertain 
whether the defendant was wearing both legs of panty hose or only a 
single leg during the robbery of a pizza restaurant, the Court of 
Appeals of Ohio overturned the conviction of the defendant in State 
v. Jackson, 621 N.E. 2d 710, 86 Ohio App. 3d 568 (Ohio App. 1993).  <P>


   Perhaps the most recent appellate ruling involving panty hose is 
a decision by a New Jersey state court, which found that the 
plaintiff in Liptak v. Rite Aid, Inc., 673 A. 2d 309, 289 N.J. Super. 
199 (N.J. App. Div. 1996), who was held by store personnel after 
being accused of stealing coupons from panty hose packages, had 
established a prima facie case of unlawful detention because a 35 
cents-off coupon did not meet the legal definition of merchandise.<P>


    Undoubtedly, this is not the American judiciary's last word on 
the subject of panty hose.  With several wearers of panty hose now 
sitting on the United States Supreme Court, a landmark opinion may be 
expected in the near future as judicial attitudes regarding the 
undergarment continue to evolve.<P>

<H3>poem by david baker</H3> 

<blockquote>

<BR>

      <b><h4> council meeting</h4></b><br>
<p>
        The latest uproar:  to allow Wendy's <Br>
        to build another fast food burger shack <br>
        on four acres of wetlands near Raccoon Creek<br>
        or to permit the conservationist<br>
<p>
        well-to-do citizenry to keep their green<br>
        space and thus assure long, unsullied views<br>
        from their redwood decks, picture windows,<br>
        and backyards chemically rich as golf greens.<br>
<p>
        The paper's rife with spats, accusations,<br>
        pieties both ways.  Wendy's promises<br>
        flowers, jobs.  The citizens want this, too,<br>
        but want it five miles away where people<br>
<p>
        don't care about egrets, willows, good views.<br>
        Oh, it's going to be a long night:  call <br>
        out for pizza, somebody brew some tea.<br>
        Then we'll all stand up for what we believe.<br>

<FONT SIZE=5>	q.</FONT>
 I am a sentimental person who loves to celebrate romantic holidays like
Valentine's Day.  My partner, however, is not.  What can I do about this?<P>

<FONT SIZE=5>	a.</FONT> If I am correct in assuming that you have more power than a
household pet, the solution is pretty easy.  Take matters into your own hands.  Make dinner
reservations (or weekend reservations at a bed-and-breakfast) for two, decorate
the house, rent a steamy movie, whatever makes YOU happy.  Hell, buy yourself a
nice outfit or piece of jewelry if you can afford it.  The point is not to be
spiteful, simply proactive (don't you love that word, left over from 1980's
psycho-babble?).<P>

  Let your partner know what you are doing and that it is important to
you.  Invite him or her to join you in your celebration of romantic love.  DON'T beg
or accuse; you shouldn't have to constantly audition for your partner's
affection.  And DON'T try (or expect) surprises.  If your partner doesn't think on the
same lines as you in this respect, you are only setting yourself up for a major
disappointment.  Respect yourself, and make the occasion fun.<BR>
<BR>



<FONT SIZE=5>	q</FONT>. I am at my wits end with someone whom I thought was a good
friend.  We've shared a lot, and this person occupies a special place in my heart.  But our
friendship has become trying for me.  He only contacts me when he wants
something from me, at which time he invokes our friendship, and makes everything seem ok. 
But he doesn't follow through on his pledge of friendship.  I feel used and
stupid, but am not sure how to approach this touchy subject.<P>


<FONT SIZE=5>	a.</FONT> The institution of friendship has taken a hard hit in the late
twentieth century.  Time was when friendship was a sacred trust, and ties between
friends ran as strong as those of family.  We all got out of our houses more; had
a sense of community and loyalty.  Now we waste our time driving from one barren
landscape to another, isolated from people to care about, things to care about, places
to care about.  Friends have become as disposable as yesterday's gadgets and the
prefab houses we live in.  
	If you have tried to communicate your sense of hurt and
disappointment with your friend, and you continue to see the same patterns that are hurting your
spirit, try putting your friendship on long-term hold.  Maybe a few years (or
decades) down the road your friend will rediscover his priorities and you two can
renew a healthy exchange of friendship.  <BR>
<BR>


<FONT SIZE=5>	q</FONT>. My boss gave me a few breaks at an important juncture in my
career, breaks for which I am very grateful.  But I've noticed that others in my
workplaceoepeople who work very hard and produce good workoedon't get the same breaks, and
in fact are treated downright unfairly.  I am conflicted as to where my loyalty
should lie, and what I should do.<P>

	<FONT SIZE=5>a.</FONT> Start making your plans for a graceful exit.  If you can't muster
up the courage to confront the situation, you don't need to commit career
suicide, or turn on the person who gave you your big break.  
But get real.  How long can you stomach such a work culture?  And
should you see the writing
on the wall?  Many a privileged denizen of upper management has sold his soul for
a great job, only to be dumped when his management style (or hairstyle) goes out
of fashion. It's not easy leaving a Faustian situation, but do it.  Your soul
will thank you. <BR>
<BR>


<FONT SIZE=5>	q.</FONT> I always get depressed at this time of year.  What can I do
about it?<P>

<FONT SIZE=5>	a.</FONT> If it's a yearly but tolerable situation (Seasonal Affective
Disorder[SAD]-get it?-I think they call it), try doing a few things to help
you get
through it until the sun comes back in the Spring.  Here are a few ideas:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1.<B> Make some little healthy changes</B> in your life, and stick to them.  Go
for a walk first thing in the morning, for example, or get lost in a silly novel
every night before you go to sleep.<P>

2.<B> Pay attention to your body</B>: eat healthy, fresh foods, avoid alcohol,
and get a little exercise.<P>

3. <B>Return to things that have inspired you</B> in the past.  Reading an old
book of poetry, looking at the work of a familiar artist, or visiting a
favorite place can be renewing exercises.<P>

4. <B>Plan for the future. </B> Read seed catalogues, start making plans for your
summer vacation, or plot out projects you can pursue in the warmer weather.
Keep in mind that these activities are simply ways to treat the symptoms of
"the winter blues." </BLOCKQUOTE> If you sense that your depression is more than the above
suggestions can remedy, SEE YOUR DOCTOR.  Don't wallow too deeply in Dostoyevskian
despair before you get help.<BR>
<BR>


<FONT SIZE=5>	q.</FONT> Do you follow a beauty regimen?  I like expensive
department-store beauty products, and things like that, but wonder if I'm just being duped by the
oppressive powers of Madison-Avenue media hype.<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>
	a.</FONT> There's no doubt that "Madison Avenue" has played a harshnumber on most individuals' self-image.  We're all too fat, we smell, our noses are too
big, our lips lack definition, and our skin is imperfect.  We seek to cure these
media-produced ills by buying more and more silly, not to mention expensive, products,
which are flaunted in front of us constantly whether we try to avoid them or not.
	But hey, I'm not above indulging in a little luxury.  I adore
getting facials and body massages, and there is little else that makes me feel better than
having a great haircut.  And even though every dermatologist I have ever spoken to
tells me it's pointless, I still cleanse, tone, and moisturize (plus smear a few
placebos over my face) twice daily. After all, everyone needs a little vice in
her life.<P>

<IMG SRC="austin.jpg" WIDTH=220 HEIGHT=149 align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>
<FONT SIZE=4><B> In 1986</B></FONT>, a group of Austin mavericks flagrantly ignored the then-bottomed out

Texas economy and launched the <A HREF="http://www.austin360.com:80/community/opera/index.htm">Austin Lyric Opera</A>, the city's first professional
opera company.  As it enters its 10th season, ALO can boast 26 productions
staged, an annual budget of more than $2.7 million a year, and the auspicious role as
one of the largest fine arts employers in Central Texas.  <P>
The three-opera season
is the hottest ticket with Austin flaunting an attendance of 35 for every 1,000
residents - more than three times the opera-going rate of some similarly sized
cities
in America - as well as regularly sold-out performances.  The company has
relied on
a repertoire of well-known operas - <b>La Traviata, Madama Butterfly, The
Magic Flute,
and Don Giovanni</b> - but also had the chutzpah to stage
<b>Tannh&aumluser</b> with a set evoking
a destroyed freeway and to advertise <b>The Ballad of Baby Doe</b> - Douglas
Moore's opera
based on the true-life sturm-und-drang of Colorado silver baron Horace Tabor and
his wife Baby Doe - with the admonishment  "No line dancing, please."
<P>



ALO's success is hardly surprising as Austin had really no need of a
promptbook to discover
that opera would satisfy its every demand for divertissement.  A city
characterized by a surplus of attitude, an excess of education, an abundance of
curiosity, and a litany of justifications for everything it does, Austin bears
the perfect profile.  When ALO launched its first season, every homegrown
aficionado, displaced New Yorker, or misplaced European, weary of traveling
elsewhere for a performance fix, emerged in triumph. Every<i> parvenu</i> buff and
patron claimed to have loved opera all along.  The excess of sweeping
characters,
the artifice of the drama, the minutiae of the attendant trivia, the style and
the gossip, all appealed to an audience who, in a newsletter distributed
before a
recent performance, read with equal attention the <b>Psychic Table of Rich White
Trash in Love</b> comparing the Horace Tabor/Baby Doe scandal to the Donald
Trump/Marla Maples affair, along with the more staid background notes.
<P> Also of
enormous importance to Austin, the opera provides the city with one of its few
opportunities to dress up as evidenced by the habiliment seen in the lobby
during
intermission:
<br>
<ul>

<LI><b><i>Slacker</i>  beget <i>Rent</i></b>
<br>
Cheap tickets plus a large population of students and other
slightly disenfranchised youth equals a crop of opera-going
twenty-somethings for
whom "dressed up" means black tights without holes, a new lime green vinyl
purse,
polished jewelry for pierced body-parts, and freshly touched up purple coifs.
<br>
<LI><b>Putting on the Dog</b>
<br>
Damn the animal rights activists, fur speed ahead.  Dozens of
fur coats fill the dress circle seats on opening nights reminding us that
politically correct Austin - despite the fact that the only Neiman-Marcus in its
city limits is an outlet store - still shares the same state as Dallas.
<br>
<IMG SRC="austin2.jpg" WIDTH=82 HEIGHT=220 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=right>
<LI><b>Rode hard and put away wet</b>
<br>
 One opening night, seated amongst the donors and
doyennes, were two long tall cowboys in boots, chaps, dusters, and hats.  "They
said that after years of owning a profitable ranch, they were now spending their
time traveling the world and seeing opera," shrugged one ALO official who talked
to the duo during an intermission.  "You should see the way the stare at us when
we go to the Met!" the cowboys guffawed.
<br>
<LI><b>Don't like the weather? Wait 10 minutes</b>
Seasons don't abide by any schedule in Austin where a sudden Blue Norther
can plummet the temperature 30
degrees in a matter of hours or six inches of rain will dump from the sky in an
hour and produce flash floods powerful enough to float a Chevy Suburban.
Hence a
spaghetti strap peach-colored summer formal dress makes an unabashed
display on a
frigid January night, while on a balmy March evening, the fur coats make an
encore appearance in the dress circle.  With climate-controlled environments,
every place can be summer, or winter, for 15 minutes.
<br>
<LI><b>Anti-attire</b>
<br>
The mezzanine and balcony sections fill with aging hippies,
distracted university types, New Agers too serene to care, along with other
members of the habitually under-dressed who just, well, wear something clean or
something sensible.
<br>
<LI><b>Leave your personality at the tone</b>
<br>
 Beepers, cellular phones, pocket computers,
and digital watches must be turned off during opera performances, leaving male
cyber-types togged out, wide-eyed, and twitching in ill-fitting suits and theme
ties.
<br>
<LI><b>Big Hair 'N Beads dates the Texas Tuxedo</b>
<br>
Women in Big Texas Hair and sparkling bead-encrusted jewel-toned dresses
are escorted by men donning the Texas Tuxedo:
a typical tuxedo coat and shirt with a cumber bum replaced by a plate-sized belt
buckle tops creased jeans tucked inside well-polished cowboy boots.
</ul>
<P>
Such eclectic garb reflects the flux of a city always in the process of deciding
what it wants to be:  a liberal university town; a counter-cultural eco-correct
mecca; an emerging metropolis of the Southwest; a slick hub of cyber-business;
or, all of the above.  Yet such flux, which would throw any ordinary citizenry
into confusion about knowing what to wear, hardly seems to present a sartorial
conundrum for a city where even donning a t-shirt, however absent-mindedly,
becomes one's very own public statement of personal identity.<BR>

<H2>rockets red glare</H2>

<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=4 CELLPADDING=4>

<TR VALIGN=Top>
<td>


<FONT SIZE=4><B>If you're planning </B></FONT>to visit the Florida Keys, you might spend
more time in your automobile than snorkeling the reefs.  The
Department of Defense is going to halt traffic on US 1 while they
fire rockets from north Florida and intercept them with rockets
launched from the Keys.  In addition to the beautiful sunsets we
have, now you will be able to actually watch a mini Star Wars.
I'll bet Disney will be jealous since their rockets are so puny.<P>



Not everyone, including me, is excited about this turn of events.
Having fired a few rockets when I was a pilot in the Air Force, I
know they can zig when they're supposed to zag.  Our island
communities have enough problems with power failures, lousy cable
TV, a fragile water supply and the National Atmospheric and
Oceanic Administration.<P>

<IMG SRC="keywestpatrick.jpg" WIDTH=170 HEIGHT=220 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=left>
Congress, in its wisdom, decided to save the Keys.  They
established the Florida Keys Marine Sanctuary to be Administered
by NAOA.  This past November in a straw poll, Keys residents
voted it down.  We're not anti-environmental.  Actually, some of
us are tree-huggers.  We just want the current layers of
bureaucracy (Federal, State and County) to enforce existing laws,
thank you very much.  NAOA took note of the negative vote and
ignored it.<P>


But, the Federal mill keeps grinding out more and more
regulations.  As of now the regulations for recreational and
commercial use of the waters surrounding the Keys is about a foot
thick.  Our Congressman, who is actually a pretty nice chap, is
not straddling the fence, he is on both sides of the fence at the
same time.  He's in a no-win situation.<P>


I've researched the new regulations and haven't found anything
permitting or denying rockets being shot into the Sanctuary.
Since the Sanctuary will be under Federal control, I suppose the
Federal Government would rather launch rockets where it's warm
and sunny than in some isolated part of the world.  My greatest
concern is that the rockets were built by the low bidder, so I'll
keep my head down.<BR>

<H2>the fabulous cookie spam</H2>

<B>My daughter and I</B> had just finished a salad at Neiman-Marcus Cafe in Dallas and
decided to have a small dessert. Because both of us are such cookie lovers, we
decided to try the "Neiman-Marcus Cookie". It was so excellent that I asked if they
would give me the recipe and the waitress said with a small frown, "I'm afraid not." Well,
I said, would you let me buy the recipe? With a cute smile, she said, "Yes." I asked how
much, and she responded, "Only two fifty, it's a great deal!" I said with approval, just
add it to my tab.<P>


Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement from Neiman-Marcus and it was
$285.00. I looked again and I remembered I had only spent $9.95 for two salads and
about $20 for a scarf. As I glanced at the bottom of the statement, it said, "Cookie
Recipe - $250.00." That's outrageous!! I called Neiman's Accounting Dept. and told
them the waitress said it was "two-fifty," which clearly does not mean "two hundred and
fifty dollars" by any *POSSIBLE* interpretation of the phrase.<P>


Neiman-Marcus refused to budge. They would not refund my money, because
according to them, "What the waitress told you is not our problem. You have already
seen the recipe - we absolutely will not refund your money at this point." I explained to
her the criminal statutes which govern fraud in Texas, I threatened to refer them to the
Better Business Bureau and the State's Attorney General for engaging in fraud. I was
basically told, "Do what you want, we don't give a crap, and we're not refunding your
money." I waited, thinking of how I could get even, or even try and get any of my money
back. I just said, "Okay, you folks got my $250, and now I'm going to have $250.00
worth of fun."<P>


I told her that I was going to see to it that every cookie lover in the United States with an
e-mail account has a $250.00 cookie recipe from Neiman-Marcus... for free. She
replied, "I wish you wouldn't do this." I said, "Well, you should have thought of that
before you ripped me off," and slammed down the phone on her.<P>


So here it is!!! Please, please, please pass it on to everyone you can possibly think of. I
paid $250 for this... I don't want Neiman-Marcus to *ever* get another penny off of this
recipe....<P>
<blockquote>

(Recipe may be halved.) : <P>


<LI>2 cups butter
<LI>4 cups flour
<LI>2 tsp. soda
<LI>2 cups sugar
<LI>5 cups blended oatmeal**
<LI>24 oz. chocolate chips
<LI>2 cups brown sugar
<LI>1 tsp salt
<LI>1 8 oz. Hershey Bar (grated)
<LI>4 eggs
<LI>2 tsp. baking powder
<LI>3 cups chopped nuts (your choice)
<LI>2 tsp. vanilla
<LI>Measure oatmeal and blend in a blender to a fine powder.<P>

</blockquote>
Cream the butter and both sugars. Add eggs and vanilla; mix together with flour,
oatmeal, salt, baking powder, and soda. Add chocolate chips, Hershey Bar and nuts.
Roll into balls and place two inches apart on a cookie sheet. Bake for 10 minutes at 375
degrees. Makes 112 cookies.<P>


Have fun!!! This is  <B>not </B> a joke - this is a true story. Ride free, citizen!<P>

<H3>White House E-mail  CHRONOLOGY</H3>
<blockquote>


<B>1982</B> - The National Security Council (NSC) staff at the White House acquires a prototype electronic mail system, from IBM, called the Professional Office
System (PROFs).
<P>
<B>April 1985 </B>- The PROFs e-mail system becomes fully operational within the NSC,
including not only the full staff, but also home terminals for the National
Security Adviser, Robert "Bud" McFarlane, and his deputy, Admiral John M.
Poindexter.
<P>
<B>december 1986</B> - The remainder of the White House comes on line with
electronic mail, at first with the PROFs system, and later (by the end of the 1980s) through a variety of systems including VAX A-1 ("All in One"), and ccmail.
<P>
<B>december 22-25, 1986</B> - John Poindexter and Oliver North electronically shred
more than 5000 e-mail notes in the memory banks of their computer systems, as the
Iran-contra scandal breaks.
<P>
<B>december 28, 1986</B> - Career staff at the White House Communications Agency
order the december backup tapes of the e-mail system to be saved instead of recycled as usual. Subsequently, investigators from the FBI and the Tower Commission use
the backup takes to reconstruct the Iran-contra scandal.
<P>
 - The Tower Commission issues its report on Iran-contra,
reprinting hundreds of PROFs notes exchanged by McFarlane, Poindexter and
North.
<P>
<B>January 19, 1989</B> - On the last day of the Reagan presidency, the National
Security Archive files a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests
together with a lawsuit against President Ronald Reagan, to prevent the imminent
erasure of the White House electronic mail backup tapes. At 6:10 pm, on the eve
of George Bush's inauguration, U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker issues a
Temporary Restraining Order, prohibiting the destruction of the backup tapes to
the PROFs system.
<P>
<B>September 15, 1989</B> - U.S. District Judge Charles B. Richey rules that the
National Security Archive and its co-plaintiffs, including the American
Historical Association (AHA) and the American Library Association (ALA), have
standing to sue President Bush, in order to force him to comply with the
retention requirements of various records acts which potentially cover the White
House e-mail.
<P>
<B>January 25, 1991</B> - After a year-and-a-half of legal procedural wrangling, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upholds Judge Richey's
ruling on standing, denying the Bush administration's attempts to have the case
dismissed.
<P>
<B>december 20, 1992</B> - On request from the plaintiffs, Judge Richey adds the White House e-mail from the lame-duck Bush administration to the case, issuing a
restraining order preventing the Bush White House from destroying its own
backup computer records.
<P>
<B>January 6, 1993</B> - Judge Richey rules that computer tapes containing copies of
e-mail messages by Reagan and Bush White House staff must be preserved like
other government records, because the electronic versions are not simply duplicates of
paper printouts, but contain additional information beyond the paper copies.
<P>
<B>January 11 and 14, 1993</B> - Judge Richey issues specific court orders requiring
that the Bush White House preserve its computer records. In press interviews,
Judge Richey says that despite his orders, he believes that the Bush
administration is planning to destroy its e-mail files.
<P>
<B>January 15, 1993</B> - In an expedited emergency ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit upholds and modifies the rulings by Judge
Richey, holding that government officials could erase White House and NSC
computer files, as long as they preserved, on backup tapes, identical copies of
what was being erased.
<P>
<B>January 19, 1993</B> - President Bush signs a secret agreement with Don Wilson,
head of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), purporting to
grant Bush exclusive legal control over the e-mail tapes of his administration. 
Working through the night, a staff team from NARA takes custody of thousands
of tapes and disk drives, hurriedly removing them from White House offices to
prevent incoming Clinton appointees from gaining access to them.
<P>
<B>February 16, 1993</B> - NARA career staff who managed the transfer describe in an internal memo how the so-called "midnight ride" had violated NARA's own rules
for records transfers and how several sets of tapes ordered preserved by Judge Richey
had been lost, erased or damaged.
<P>
<B>May 22, 1993 </B>- Judge Richey cites the Clinton White House and the acting
Archivist of the United States for contempt of court for failing to carry out his
order to issue new and appropriate guidelines for the preservation of the
computer records of the Reagan, Bush and Clinton White House staff.
<P>
<B>August 13, 1993</B> - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
vacates Judge Richey's contempt orders but upholds his overall decision that the
Federal Records Act (FRA) requires that complete electronic copies of e-mail
messages be preserved by the White House, and by extension, government
agencies in general. The appeals court remands the case to Judge Richey to decide the
issue of the dividing line between "agency" records covered by the FRA and
presidential records covered by the Presidential Records Act.
<P>
<B>March 25, 1994</B> - In a brief filed in federal court, the Clinton administration
declares that the National Security Council is not an agency, and should be
accorded the protection from public scrutiny given to the President's personal
advisers. This argument attempts to remove the Clinton administration's White
House e-mail from the reach of FOIA requests and the FRA, arguing that all its
documents are subject only to the Presidential Records Act (PRA) and therefore
not to court oversight.
<P>
<B>December 13, 1994</B> - The e-mail plaintiffs file suit against the Acting Archivist
of the United States to void the Bush-Wilson agreement, in American Historical
Association et. al. v. Peterson.
<P>
<B>February 15, 1995</B> - Judge Richey rejects the Clinton administration's arguments about the NSC's status as "arbitrary and capricious... contrary to history, past practice and the law," and declares that the National Security Council is an
agency. The government subsequently appeals the decision, and the plaintiffs
cross-appeal against a portion of Richey's ruling that opens a loophole for
senior NSC staff giving advice to the President.
<P>
<B>February 27, 1995</B> - In a separate opinion in the lawsuit over the Bush-Wilson
agreement, Judge Richey declares the agreement "null and void," writing that "No
one, not even a President, is above the law." The New York Times subsequently
editorializes, under the headline "A Special Place in History for Mr. Bush," that
"No President has the right to corner official records in an effort to control
his place in history." (March 1, 1995, page A18)
<P>
<B>September 8, 1995</B> - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit hears oral arguments in the case on the issue of Judge Richey's decision
and the agency versus Presidential status of the NSC.

Why, just the other day, certain members of the George Jr.  staff were singing, not quite in unison and not exactly harmoniously, the heartfelt but bloated and dreadful <A HREF="gambit.html#link">Lee Greenwood song, <i>I'm Proud to Be an American </i></A> - you know the old chestnut - until the cel of musical stooges split off into marketing  segments  and focus groups bent on discussing  the relationship of  bikinis to  beer and boats; and then the group downsized itself and went to lunch. Ah, so that's what an American is!
<P>
Well, well. We are nevetheless glad to have as a fellow American the ubiquitous  Martha Stewart, whose $200 million self-named empire of food, clothing,  gardening, mail-order and magazine business in a way gave rise, in a way, to George  Jr. Magazine.

EDNA BUCHANAN: <BR>
Up Close and Homicidal
<P>
Edna Buchanan's latest novel, <i>Act of Betrayal, </i> (Hyperion, $21.95) is her fourth whodunit starring Britt Montero, a police reporter with the fictional <i>Miami News. </i>Buchanon's other books are <i>Contents Under Pressure, Miam, It's Murder  </i> and <i>Suitable for Framing,  </i> She won the Pulitzer Prize in 1986 for general reporting at the<i>Miami Herald.</i>
<BR clear=all>
<hr width=75%>
<P>
<font size=+3>q:</font> What kind of writer do you think you would have become if you hadn't relocated to Miami?  Do you think you would have become a writer at all?
<P>
<font size=+3>a:</font>I would have been a writer, but without my experience in Miami as a police reporter, the subject might have been less intense.  I feel certain that it would have been somewhat along the same lines, however.  Early on, I was fascinated by the dark princes of my childhood, The Mad Bomber, Willie (The Actor) Sutton, who was the Babe Ruth of bank robbers, and mobster Lucky Luciano.  When my grandfather died, I was still a small girl but my immediate response was: "Who killed him?"  It never occurred to me then that people do actually die of natural causes.  It's still a surprise to me.  Of course that may also say something about my grandfather and his personality.
<P>         
<font size=+3>q:</font> What have you found to be the most difficult aspect of making the transition from the police beat to fiction?
<P>     
<font size=+3>a:</font>The only difficulty was when I began my first novel.  I had clamored to do it, it was my childhood dream, but when I got the chance, I panicked.  I kept glancing to the left, for my notebook.  It wasn't there of course. I was on my own.  I kept remembering what Hemingway once said: 'That anybody who writes novels should work first for a daily newspaper - but never for more than eighteen months.'
<P>
<font size=+3>q:</font> Hey, you went over the time limit.
<P>     
<font size=+3>a:</font>By nearly two decades.  But then  something  wonderful happened.  I had heard      other writers talk about  this, and it's true.  After four chapters or so, the characters suddenly sprang to life.  The villain became far more evil and treacherous than I had ever imagined.  I was shocked.  I would say, "Oh no!  Look what she's doing now!" to Flossie, my favorite cat     who sat on my lap while I wrote.  And a minor character, a middle-aged police  detective became really powerful and tried to take over the book.  I had to almost  physically grapple with him and force him back with the promise that he could  return later, as a lead character in a future book.  Which he did, as Dan Flood,  the dying detective, in Miami, It's Murder.   Oddly enough, both books were nominated for Edgars.
<P>
The best thing about the transition from the police beat to fiction is resolution. As a journalist, I covered murders that went unsolved forever, missing people  who stayed lost, corpses never identified no matter how hard I worked or how   many clues we unearthed.  Those cases haunt me.  But in fiction, I am in charge.  At last!  I can wrap up the  loose ends, solve all the perplexing mysteries and, best  of all,  write the endings.  I can make the good guys win and the bad guys get  what they deserve.  So unlike real life.
<P>
<font size=+3>q:</font>  In your novels, you thrust Britt Montero into one life-threatening situation after   another.  How do her experiences  compare with your own?
<P>     
<font size=+3>a:</font> Many of the threats I received as a reporter are actually carried out against Britt.  She is far more adept at surviving than I would be.  For example: I received  threatening letters from an elusive rapist.  Britt encounters one, up close and  homicidal.  I was threatened by the deranged mother of a man whose arrest I had    reported. Britt is attacked by the deranged, knife wielding mother of a killer. A  police official once predicted that I would be arrested some day for being too aggressive as a reporter.  So far, I have eluded capture.  But Britt was arrested --  on a murder charge.  I weathered a major hurricane, trapped in a house.  The   hurricane of the century traps Britt in a house -- with a serial killer -- in  Act of  Betrayal.  I am a reporter, a klutz, somebody who takes notes, not action.  Britt is strong, brave, agile, and athletic, all the things I would like to be.
<P>       
<font size=+3>q:</font>  Your novels are written with an amazing attention to detail.  What kind of research do you do in preparation for writing them?
<P>     
<font size=+3>a:</font>  Old newsroom habits die hard.  I ride the midnight shift with the cops, go to the   morgue, to the lab.  When Britt was locked in the trunk of her car by the villain in  Miami, It's Murder,  I even climbed into the trunk of my own car and slammed the lid shut to see what it smelled like, how dark, cramped, and stuffy it was, and if I  could escape.  In my case, a friend stood by to rescue me, if necessary.  In Britt's case, the bad guys pushed the car, with her in the trunk, into a deep and murky Everglades canal and beat  feet out of there.  Poor Britt.
<P>          
<font size=+3>q:</font>  What's next in Britt's future?  Will she ever win journalism's big enchilada -the Pulitzer Prize?  
<P>     
<font size=+3>a:</font> I have big plans and adventures for Britt, in both her  personal and professional  lives.  She's already won a Green Eyeshade Award, which I won more than a decade ago.  I don't know about the Pulitzer.
<P>
<font size=+3>q:</font> Your style of writing has drawn raves and sold a few million books.  Pardon this rather standard question: Which  writers would you say have most influenced you?
<P>     
<font size=+3>a:</font>It's hard to say.  I read everything, from cereal boxes to the flyers strangers shove   under my windshield wipers.  My favorite novel of all time is Raintree County  by Ross Lockridge, Jr. It's about American journalism, patriotism, and a star- crossed love affair a hundred years ago.  Like the Bible, you can pick it up, read  any page, and gain something.  It's poetry.  Forget the movie, if you saw it, the  book is something entirely different.
<P>         
<font size=+3>q:</font>  As a reporter, you've interviewed thousands of people throughout your career.  How does it feel to be on the other end?
<P>     
<font size=+3>a:</font>Scary and intimidating.
<P>     
<font size=+3>q:</font> You are still officially on leave from the Miami Herald.  Do you plan to return?  Do you still want to cover the police beat?
<P>     
<font size=+3>a:</font> I miss the good creative people in the newsroom and the interaction with cops and  crooks and people on the street.  Most of all, I miss the joy of constant    communication with the readers who would see my story in tomorrow's paper, or  Sunday's at the latest.  They wrote, they called, they showed up in the newsroom.       Everything is so different with books.  The process takes so long.  By the time  your work touches readers who respond, you are deep into the next book, or the one after that.  I miss the instant gratification.  I miss the Herald.   I want to be back out on my   beat.  But I have also wanted to write books since I was four years old, and this is my chance.  And it is impossible to cover so demanding a beat and  also write a novel.  Novels, unlike non-fiction, require an almost reclusive lifestyle.  You can't just put your notes aside and casually return later to where you left off.  At least I can't.  You must immerse yourself in the world of your  characters.  And when you succeed in doing that, you fear and resent anything  that interferes.  You want to see   everything through your characters' eyes.  When    you are on a roll,   working hard -- and the door bell rings, it's infuriating,  maddening.  You want to plunge a knife into the heart of whoever it might be.  The fuller brush man, your mother. . .
<P>          
<font size=+3>q:</font> The late Elizabeth Montgomery portrayed you in two made-for-television movies  based on The Corpse Had a Familiar Face.   Were you pleased with the results?
<P>     
<font size=+3>a:</font> The scripts were abysmal, but I thought Montgomery was wonderful.  Even though I was told she was ill, I thought she would get well.  She was a  woman who made you believe in miracles and magic.  I'm so sad that we have  lost her.
<P>     
<font size=+3>q:</font>  Miami is so vivid in your novels that at times the city seems almost like a major  character.  Will your books always be set in Miami, and what is it that's so magic  about the city?
<P>     
<font size=+3>a:</font> It is mystical.  The first time I saw it was like coming home, as though this is  where I was meant to be.  It's the jumping off place.  Look at the map.  We are  down there at the very bottom.  People on the run, from the law, each other and   from their own personal demands, all wind up there eventually if they run long enough.  It's always been that way.  In recent years, people on the run from the  south, from wars and dictators and poverty and from their own personal demands  have also made Miami their destination.  And, of course, they all bring their  demons with them.  Then the temperature soars, the barometric pressure drops,  the full moon rises, and all hell breaks loose.  What a great place to be a writer.

EDVARD RADZINSKY: <BR> 
Stalin's Return and the Great Amnesia
<P>
Edvard Radzinsky is the author of <i>Stalin  </i>(Doubleday, $30), the first 
in-depth biography of  the man who was known among his countrymen as  "the Boss."  Radzinsky  based  his book on newly released documents from Russia's  secret archives and in-depth interviews. His previous work was <i>The Last Star,  </i>a biography of Tsar  Nicholas II.
<P>
<br clear=all>
<hr width=75%>
<P>
<font size=+3>q:</font> More than 40 years have passed since Stalin's death, and yet his name 
and face seem to be appearing with remarkable frequency in news stories 
coming out of Russia. Is there a rebirth of interest in Stalin - or even perhaps a rebirth of the Stalin "cult"?
<P>
<font size=+3>a:</font> The restoration of his cult is already underway in Russia. A demonstration held on May 9, 1995 confirmed it. The 50,000 demonstrators  sang songs from the Stalin era as they proceeded from the Belorussian  Station, through the main streets of Moscow, to Mayakovsky Square.
<P>
<font size=+3>q:</font> The first time since his death?
<P>
<font size=+3>a:</font>   For the first time since his death, dozens of portraits of Stalin floated  by, held aloft over the heads of the demonstrators. Communists, monarchists and Russian fascists marched side by side, at one in their devotion to the Boss. And rightly so. Was he not a greater  national-socialist than Hitler? Had he not created the greatest of  monarchist cults and enlarged the empire of the Romanovs? And had he not  served the Great Dream - a world in which Bolshevism reigned supreme.  Stalin had bided his time underground for more than 40 years. While those  of his victims who had survived the horrors of his reign of terror died  off one by one, and while their children grew old . . . But now that the  "Great Amnesia" had come upon the land, the Boss had risen from the grave.
<P>
<font size=+3>q:</font> The Communists made an impressive comeback in the last Parliamentry 
election, last year. Do you believe they're capable of regaining the country?
<P>
<font size=+3>a:</font> Yes, for the first time since the fall of the Soviet empire this 
fearful specter has reappeared.
<P>
<font size=+3>q:</font> How is this possible?
<P>
<font size=+3>a:</font> Stalin's current popularity - the first sign that communism can make a 
comeback in Russia, as it had in February 1917 - is a result of the 
weakness and lack of vision of democratic powers there, the bungling of 
the Russian bourgeoisie, and the people's thousand-year-old 
predisposition toward autocracy and slavery.
<P>
<font size=+3>q:</font> How does the Chechen situation - the repression of the independence 
movement there - fit in to this so-called Stalinist revival?
<P>
<font size=+3>a:</font> It's an attempt to continue the same Stalinist imperialist policy of 
resolving matters through force and bloodshed. 
<P>
<font size=+3>q:</font> Oh, great.
<P>
<font size=+3>a:</font> The whole story is one of  blatant disregard for such notions as the sanctity of human life and the  right of people to self-determination.

<br><br><h3>NICHOLAS A. BASBANES INTERVIEWS JAY McINERNEY</h3>

   When ``Bright Lights, Big City'' was published in 1984, there was a
strong belief that the 20-something generation Jay McInerney was writing
about didn't read novels, let alone buy
very many of them.
<P>
   As a result, the decision was made by Vintage Books, a division of
Random House, to forego bringing out a hardcover edition of the young
author's hip take on the fast life in New
York City, and go directly instead with an inexpensive paperback version.
<P>   
``You could call what happened a desperate stab to reach an
audience,'' McInerney, now 41, said last week during an interview to
discuss publication of his fifth book, ``The Last of the
Savages'' ( Knopf,  $24), a hardcover release that demonstrates quite
persuasively that his readership encompasses a much wider demographic
spectrum now than initially
envisioned 12 years ago.
<P>   
``I was pretty nervous about going that original paperback route, but
two months after it was published, it was selling 20, 25, 30,000 copies a
week, and I think maybe I reached that
critical mass because I was in paperback first. Word of mouth carried
that book along for quite a while, and a lot of people who might not have
bought it in hardcover were willing to pay
$6.95 for a paperback. It finally sold about a million copies, and I'd be
crazy to argue with those figures.''
<P>
   Now, McInerney's books are reviewed in all of the major publications,
and the notices reflect a variety of attitudes, which is a healthy vital
sign for any author. But there remains the matter of his 1980s image, an
image forged not only by a wealth of immediate success, but by the
widespread notoriety his carefree social life occasioned.
<P>   
``It is true that I became a wildly over-celebrated author, and that a
lot of people still identify me with the kind of behavior and excess that
is now associated with New York in the
1980s,'' McInerney acknowledged. ``It also is true that I was made into a
scapegoat for the perceived sins of that era.''
<P>   
The two books that followed ``Bright Lights, Big City,'' ``Ransom''
and ``Story of My Life,'' seemed to reinforce the view held by some that
McInerney was destined to be a one-book wonder,
although newspapers continued to hum with gossip of his nocturnal wanderings.
<P>   
Publication in 1992 of his fourth novel, ``Brightness Falls,'' marked
a striking reversal, ``sparking evidence,'' according to one reviewer,
``of the author's maturation as a writer and of his talents as a
storyteller with a pronounced gift for dialogue.''
<p>   
Set in the days leading up to the Wall Street collapse of 1987, that
novel also represented McInerney's farewell to a tumultuous decade, an
artistic separation now made virtually
complete in ``The Last of the Savages.''
<P>   
In this new work, McInerney touches on the '80s, but he begins in 1965
and sweeps through three decades to the final years of the 20th century,
using the friendship of two boarding school
roommates as his vehicle.
<P>   
Patrick Keane, an Irish Catholic scholarship student who becomes a
successful New York lawyer, is the narrator; Will Savage, the son of a
wealthy Southern family, is blue-blood and
privileged to the core, but is driven only by a mission to produce the
music of African-American rhythm and blues singers.
<P>   
``This is my least autobiographical book in every way,'' McInerney
said, although he added that he sees parts of himself in each of the
characters. He also bridled at suggestions made by
several prominent reviewers that ``The Last of the Savages'' is his take
on F. Scott Fitzgerald's ``The Great Gatsby.''    ``I didn't have a model
for this book,'' he insisted. ```Gatsby' takes place over the course of a
summer, and the narrator in that book, Nick Carraway, is a man who hardly knew
Jay Gatsby; my book is about friendship, and about two guys who have
known each other for 30 years. If anything, it is more of a `Brideshead
Revisited' than it is a `Great Gatsby.'''
<P>   
Contentedly married now and the father of 18-month-old twins,
McInerney lives half the year in Tennessee just outside Nashville, and
spends the other six months in Manhattan. He admits finding the slower
change of pace agreeable to his writing, and to his peace of mind.
<P>      
``I didn't directly experience the '60s, so maybe this book is my '60s
envy,'' he said. ``My other books take place over a week or two, which in
New York can be almost a generation. I got kind
of inspired being in the South, and I wanted to do something different,
something from a historical perspective, with a strong Southern influence.''
<P>
   Hard at work now on his next novel, McInerney said he will return to
New York for the setting, but will people it with older characters.
``This will be a relatively short, relatively comic
novel that is tentatively titled `Model Behavior.' Oddly enough, it is
written in short sections, some in brief paragraphs; some are in first
person, some are in third person, and a couple are
even in second person.''
<P>
   Whether or not the work-in-progress represents a linear development in
his writing career is not something McInerney feels he can judge at this
point.    ``What I do know is that I am 41 years old and I have five
novels out there, and that's kind of exciting, regardless of what the
critics think,'' he concluded.
<P>      
``I would like it a lot if I didn't have to deal with the inevitable
backlash to my earlier success. But that is inevitable, I suppose, and I
wouldn't trade it for a normal career. The truth of the matter is that
it's been a very interesting life for me so far.''

<P>
   Until tomorrow, courage in every endeavor.

<H2>Christo and Jeanne-Claude's<BR> 
Wrapped Reichstag:  An Insider's View</H2>
<P>
<H3>By Iris Sandkuhler</H3>
<P>
Iris Sandkuhler is an Assistant Professor of Art at Georgia Southern University.  The "Wrapped Reichstag" was her fifth project with Christo.  She has known the Christos for nearly 20 years.  Sandkuhler worked with the Christos on "Wrapped Walk Ways" (Loose Park, Kansas City, Missouri, 1977-78), "Surrounded Islands" (Biscayne Bay, Greater Miami, Florida, 	1980-83), "The Pont-Neuf Wrapped" (Paris, 1975-85), "The Umbrellas" (Japan-U.S.A., 1984-91), and, of course, "Wrapped Reichstag, Project" (Berlin, 1972-1995).

<p>
When Jeanne-Claude told me I'd be Assistant to the Head of The Reichstag Project, Berlin, 1971-95,  I panicked and immediately started taking German classes.  Talking to my relatives was one thing, but telling strangers what to do was something else.  I studied hard and in a little more than a year found myself sitting at a conference table my first day on the job taking furious notes, trying to catch up to speed.  The meeting lasted five hours and was 95 percent German.  I became a consultant.  They asked me a lot of questions about what it was like on other projects, and how things worked.  Also questions about Jeanne-Claude and Christo's personalities.
<P>
Nine months later, the flavor of working on The Reichstag Project is the flavor of seeing how "my people" (Germans) think and behave in the  workplace.  There is also the lingering taste of Berlin and Russia by way  of (former) East Germans.
 <P>
June 7, 1995:  Gave last final and turned in grades.  Drove to  Atlanta.June 8:  Left in the p.m. for Berlin (changed planes in Zurich). June 9:  Arrived in Berlin.  Cold, raining, gray.  Sonja (a former Georgia Southern art student) picked me up.  I  swung by the project site to check it out.  There was already a skeletal structure (aesthetic) in place at the top of the building.  Found Wolfgang and said "hi."  Drove to Sonja's to settle in.  
 <P>
<B>EXCERPTS FROM MY JOURNALS</B>
<P>
<B>9:00 p.m.  Friday</B>. My first day here.  The cold rain has finally stopped and the air (or me) has finally warmed.  I had a traumatic shower aftermy long flight.  The hot water lasted about four minutes then became ICE cold.  And I mean ice.  It was painful beyond belief.  I was covered in soap and shampoo in a frigid room.  Something is wrong with the hot-water unit.  Suffered through the rinse cycle one body part at a time.
<P>
The household (all women) is on the second floor of a six-story complex.  Our windows look toward the inside of a giant, squared "O" building, the middle of which contains a playground, some parking and a lot of renovation garbage.  It's interesting cause most of the block-length building looks quite middle class, while our end of it is marred by graffiti (lots of anarchy signs), rubble, boarded-up (with any and all materials) windows and door ways.  It was such a shock for me to see all the garbage and graffiti.  Chunks of facades missing from buildings.  The neglect.  These buildings - unattractive rectangles for people to live in . . . This is a part of Germany that I've never seen or suspected, having always visited Munich, which is immaculately clean and conservative, and under the wing of my relatives.  Here it looks like a war happened and restoration is slow or nonexistent.
 <P>
This squat seems to run well.  If one cooks, one cooks automatically for 15 people.  Anything you want, you go in and eat.  People take turns grocery shopping . . . the members of the co-op/squat/commune contribute money every week.  Most of these people are (former) East Germans.  I now live in East Berlin.
 <P>
<B>June 10.</B>  Day No. 2 in Berlin.  Up at 7:30 - 8:00.  German coffee (could melt a spoon).  Hard rolls, cheese and butter.  Milk chocolate.  
 <P>
A group of the squatters bought a boat together, which they're refinishing.  I asked about it and the explanation was simple: They pitched in together because, alone, no one had the money to own a boat.   I realized the oddness of it: This was my first "real world" exposure to communism.  This part of it, at least, seemed to work. 
 <P>
Sonja took me to the subway where I bought a week's worth of tickets. They use the honor system, but occasionally spot-check.  With my maps, I  found my way to a main terminal "Alexander Platz".  That's where the communists built a giant space needle T.V. tower and spy station (to spy on West Berlin).  I changed to the above- ground train, which deposited me within eyesight of the Reichstag along the river.
 <P>
My meeting began at 10 a.m. and lasted till 3 p.m. without a break.  I still maintain I understand 70 percent, especially when they discuss one point for a half hour!  I'm being trained to deal with the Monitors.  The project is broken up into many categories - some of which are the press, construction, and monitors.  There will be 1,200 in two waves.  Today we worked out scheduling (shifts, training, rotation, pay, taxes, forms, ID, no shows) tote bags, uniforms, and meal tickets.  Stages of wrapping the building.  June 14, 15 training.  The 16th to hoist up the fabric. The 17th to do the roof. The 18th for the inner courtyards.  The 19th and 20th wrap facades.  Close to 1 million swatches will be given out when the project officially "opens", or is completed.
 <P>
One of the heads of the project, Roland, took me and another "guest worker" for a white bratwurst, and gave us a tour of the surrounding buildings that we will occupy for the project.  An (East) German government building will serve as the canteen.  The old interior is in a state of disrepair.  Stuff haphazardly stapled, glued or patched together 
but nothing restored.  Once elegant tiles covered with something that looks like fake wood shelf paper that squashes when you walk on it.  Doors cushioned with vinyl (obviously and carelessly stapled on) so no one could eavesdrop when government officials had meetings.  All this contrasted with a majestic marble staircase and statues.  Everywhere buildings are falling apart.  Garbage bins filled with rubble.  Old, 
broken down electrical things mixed in with the new.  Children playing in the heaps of scrap metal, plastic cars, chunks of cement, dangerous metal scraps . . .  I was home by 6 p.m.
 <P>
Another traumatic shower.  Again I was all soaped up when the heater went out and immediately delivered nothing but ice-cold water.  They said they'd fixed it.  Obviously not.  The weather's gotten colder.  Should have brought winter clothes.
 <P>
<B>June 11.</B>  Day No. 3 in Berlin.  Another good sleep.  Dragged myself out of my snug (mattress) bed on the floor in an ice-cold room.  Gazed down into the rubble filled courtyard as I was getting ready for work.  Saw a man hanging around, acting paranoid.  I was curious as to what he was up  to.  A few minutes later someone joined him.  They went off to the side, continually glancing around (but never glancing up, where I'd stepped  back from the window).  I suspected drugs.  Turned out to be cartons of cigarettes.  Black market cigarettes.  
 <P>
Yesterday it took me an hour and a half to get home from work.  Today just 45 minutes and I forgot my map.  It was pouring rain just in time for me to walk the last 15 minutes along the river Spree to the Reichstag.  I was soaked and freezing.  The other guest worker had arrived an hour earlier but no one was there to tell us what to do.  Vladimir greeted me and told stories of the Bulgarian mafia.
 <P>
I was put to work translating the roof-panel schedule into a visual plan for the monitors that could be photocopied.  A bird's eye view.  They will begin opening it at 5:30.  That's military time.  5:30 a.m.
  <P>
During this time, I chatted to an (East) German, Siegward, who doesn't speak any English.  He told me horror stories about the wall.  I didn't know it bisected buildings.  I asked, "Why didn't people just blast through the walls?"  He said the government treated it like a mouse that keeps getting into your home.  You kill them, find the new hole and plug it up.  Plus, not everyone wanted to escape.  And anyone could turn you in.
 <P>
My next job around 1 p.m. was matching computer-label names with monitor applications in a huge three-ring binder, removing the photo they sent, clipping it out the correct size then handing it on to someone who glued it on an I.D. background - then handing it to someone else who laminated them.   This is their workers' I.D.  They are expecting 600 monitors.  Tomorrow we will continue processing these applications.  The work was tedious and infinite, but it was interesting to meet Ferdinand, the Swiss collector and Gert.  We had a rhythm that sometimes bordered on manic.  The secretaries plied us with lunch and snacks to keep up our morale.
 <P>
Man, am I beat.  Jeanne-Claude and Christo aren't here yet.  I was hoping to take it a little easy before they arrive, but, as I suspected, there won't be any days off for the month that I'll be here. Sonja (who's bedroom I'm sleeping in) is in another room.  The women are discussing the situation around sharing the kitchen with the men from the other floor.  The men are not sympathetic with how women in general - and lesbians in particular - are oppressed.  They claim they are instead being oppressed by the lesbians because of some of the fliers (lesbian humor) taped up in the communal kitchen.  Well, you get the picture.
 <P>
We are planning to eat out.  I need green.  When someone got us lunch today (the canteen is not yet functional) she asked what I wanted, and I said anything green.  I got salty cake with specks of broccoli.  Seems like I've eaten nothing but bread, cheese, bratwurst, and chocolate since I got here.  I miss fruit juice.
 <P>
<B>Monday.  14:00 (2:00 pm)</B>.  I'm sitting in a window sill waiting for a store to reopen after lunch to buy another four boxes of push pins.   They're almost $2  for a box of 50.  This is my second trip of the day.  Instead of finishing up IDs I've had to put up posters up and down the "dorm" hall for the monitors.  Jeanne-Claude will arrive at 15:00 and everyone is in a panic to make everything perfect.  Three people told me three different ways to hang them.  It was getting irritating and seemed  a waste of valuable time.  Also had to shop for fruit (these diversions may be the only way I get to see Berlin).  The lady at the store complemented me on my German.  She didn't speak any English, most (East) Germans don't, having learned Russian as their second language.  Its raining, gray and so cold again.  
 <P>
Last night we (Sonja and some women from the squat) ate at a small hole in the wall (only five tables in what looked like someone's living room) typical of (East) German places to hang out.  The neighborhood looked like it probably did right after the last war.  Facades with huge chunks missing.  Exposed rusted metal structures hanging out.  I wonder if anyone ever gets hit with a chunk falling off a building as they walk beneath.  The buildings are a block long (probably cement court yards in the middle). It's  interesting to see the dilapidation running vertically down one set of apartments (with a straight edge) next to apartments where someone has renovated with new windows and cement finish on the walls.  It's all one wall, the renovation being the only division.  Here 
the poor live next door to the rich.  I wonder if they have ghettos.  Flaming orange/red hair seems to be popular with the younger crowd.
 <P>
First Tuesday in Berlin.  It's cold.  There was so much sleet 100  miles south of here that traffic was in peril.  Isn't this June!?!  No one uses heat and everyone has the windows open despite the 40- to 50-degree temperatures.  Because it's spring, they say.  Nearly full daylight and its 10 p.m.  I got to work at  8:30 this morning.  Now I'm standing at the train station writing on top of a metal box.  No train.  There's been a delay.  I'm exhausted.  I'm exhausted and just want to go home.  I told  the people in my office that I need to get some sleep before I develop  bronchitis from the cold, rain and grueling hours (they are already averaging 12 to 15) and left.  It's funny how everyone sneaks out, just disappears until the next day.  No one ever just says, "I'm going home".  
 Instead, they say they are going to the other office or going to locate so-and-so, and then they get in their car outside and leave.  Tomorrow the monitors will arrive.  I was completely involved in organizing stuff.  I'm one of the old-timers, and all the new people (98 percent of the workforce) don't know what they're doing.  Plus, these Germans (my people) want to make every thing perfect and waste precious time figuring out every possible scenario instead of going out to buy the office supplies we need to process a mass of people tomorrow.  I said, "Hey, where are the pencils?  Staplers?  Shouldn't we make some signs to divide the files up so the monitors know which line to stand in?  Who's in charge of what?  What kind of forms do they need to fill out?"  The people in this office have been here for months and they haven't organized anything.  It was making me very nervous.  I finally grabbed a pad and pen and started writing down people's names and what their assignments were to call attention to some huge gaps.  The professor in me was showing.
 <P>
<B>June 15.  10:00 a.m.</B>  I am physically and mentally exhausted.  I slept the sleep of the dead last night and woke up with my alarm clock on my chest turned off.  It was 7 a.m. and I was supposed to be at the cultural arts museum at 7:00 for the mob registration at 8:00.  The public transportation would take an hour and a half to get there from East Berlin.  I was in such a panic.  Asked a house mate how to get a cab.  None drove that part of the city (I guess the people who live there are too poor).  They said calling and waiting takes at least an hour.  The closest taxi stand was 15 minutes away.  I started jogging to it (forgot my coat!).  As luck would have it, a taxi actually came by.  I flagged it down and the traffic was awful.  It still took a half hour.  He had to drop me near the center cause the streets were closed off and rerouted already for the Reichstag.  It cost me about $35.  Shit.  Can't afford cabs in this town.  I ran across finely manicured lawns cutting straight to the Museum.  A colleague (the Swedish art collector who starts drinking beer in the morning, then hides the bottles all over the place, visiting them through-out the day) bought me a coffee to soothe my nerves when I arrived at 7:55.  Stress from the moment I opened my eyes this morning.
 <P>
Registration was a zoo.  Primarily because every 20 minutes or so someone else came from somewhere, and added or changed something about our routine.  I had to start keeping notes on all the forms (and the tangential changes) we were having them fill out.  Had to be especially careful with all the legal things.  My German studies paid off today since there were many people who spoke no English at all.  There were plenty more trying to scam their way into the project illegally, without their proper papers, etc.
 <P>
Right now there is a lull in registration. I went up to the second floor to see the second wave of monitors going through training and orientation.  It looked like a United Nations Conference.  I've heard everything already, but it was nice to sit down for just a few minutes.
 <P>
<B>Thursday June 15? </B> 10:30 p.m. on the U-Bahn.  Now, I, too, snuck out after 14 hours of work.  What I just saw in the subway passages struck me in a poignant way.  At first, I just noticed two men on the floor.  One crumbled against the wall.  The other kneeling in front of him.  The one against the wall was in his 50s.  A bloated red face in his hands sobbing mournfully, "I know, I know." The other, kneeling down in front of him was carefully and thoughtfully looking through the older man's wallet, trying to find a phone number to call asking him over and over who he could call . . .
 <P>
I wanted to photograph this, coming from a country where people are more likely to get mugged or on a good day, ignored if they're drunk and collapsed in a big-city subway.  But I knew it would be wrong.  Instead, I'll try and photograph the empty spot tomorrow.  Maybe on my way to Suzanne's place, my next home in West Berlin. <P>
<B>June 16?</B>There is a woman of about 65 who keeps showing up everyday to the Reichstag wearing silver lame' fabric.  Her hands twitch with anticipation as she tries to find the film cameras.  I observed her fidgeting and sneaking up behind an anchor woman so she would be in the frame with her.  After several takes, the film crew started yelling at her to get lost.  She keeps posing in front of unwilling cameras.  
 <P>
Then there's the "artist" in a gold leafed jacket who stands around with a sign that says "Dies ist kein Kunstwerk," followed by his name.  He smiles a plastic smile that looks as if he's practiced and then gathers an audience to lecture about why this isn't art.  I've seen free self-promotion post cards around the city.  People were already starting to catch a ride on the Christos' coat tails.  
 <P>
When Sonja had talked about the Lesbian Avengers wanting to use the project as a demonstration area, because of the media being there, I became annoyed.  Especially because Christo and Jeanne-Claude have always been equal-opportunity employers.  I told her about the Kansas City Walkway project in the '70s and how having women construction workers was unheard of . . . then -  and there we were, and in great numbers.  I tried to explain to her that it would give the wrong message.  I appealed to her art studies, particularly "content."  Even if their "visibility" had nothing to do with Christos or the project itself.  I explained the saying "riding on someone's coat tails."  During our discussion, I learned that they had modeled themselves after the American Lesbian Avengers, but the word "avenge" doesn't translate into German.  Instead, everyone believes it means "revenge."  So during all this time they have founded themselves on an incorrect principle.  Another big discussion.  A female reporter came to our communal home to interview Sonja and a few other lesbians.  We posed for a photo of us eating fire.  It was my first time.  I was nervous, hesitated and drew a blister on my bottom lip.  It was harder (nerve-wise) than I thought.
 <P>
<B>June 17.</B>  The building is becoming visually more active.  You can see some progress now.  There's a yellow metal fence surrounding the 
 Reichstag to keep the immediate building clear for the repellers.  I 
 follow photos in the newspapers on the way to and from work to keep up 
 with the latest developments.  From where I'm situated, I know more about 
 the inner workings than how the project actually looks. The old lady in 
 silver was there again, trying to get in every picture possible.  She ran 
 in front of the reporters to get within the vicinity of Christo and 
 Jeanne-Claude when they walked around the building, so she would be in 
 the picture frame.  Gert says she has a reputation of crashing parties 
 around the city.
<P>
<B>June 18. </B> The cold, rainy weather has gotten worse.  They had to postpone the unfurling of silver fabric panels because of the gusty winds.  There was a sudden downpour which caused the public (including us) to rush and crouch under nearby trees.  I forgot Germans shit in the woods.  You had to watch where you stepped.  For a people obsessed with cleanliness, I don't get it.
 <P>
<B>June 19/20.  6:30 a.m</B>.  My monitor's shift is over.  Graveyard.  I'm so tired.  Why did I bother working so hard to get over my jet lag just to 
 get caught up in swing shifts?  Now I'm undoing everything I strived for. 
  I'm seeing ghosts and things that aren't there.  Ears ringing.  Eyes 
 like sand paper.  I'm back at Suzanne's apartment.  Pigeons cooing on the 
 roof tops and window sills that only open up to a courtyard.  I'm on the 
 fourth floor with enough sliver of sky to guess what the weather is going 
 to be like.  Sun or rain, I know it won't get above the 50s.  Gert 
 described to me how these buildings were built during the industrial 
 revolution.  If you had money you lived with windows facing outside, the 
 street, trees, etc.  Less money, you face inside so you only see a cement 
 court yard and into your neighbors windows.  Sometimes an additional 
 building was built in the courtyard so no windows really face "outside."  
 There's also the "walk-up" factor.  The poorer you are, the higher you 
 must go.  By the time sounds find me from the windows or ground below, 
 they are shrill and loud.  You can hear the most intimate conversations 
 from the first floor as if it was going on in the next room.  I think 
 this is going to be a problem.  If I wear ear plugs, I won't wake up to 
 the alarm . . .  Gert said this is why so many people have a garden in 
 the country.
 <P>
 The city isn't really awake yet.  Daylight starts at around 3:30 a.m.  
 This is a magical time.  Sunlight on empty streets.  It never gets really 
 dark here when the clouds are gone.  There's still daylight at 10 p.m.  I 
 find it unnerving.  So far north I guess.  I'm physically and mentally 
 exhausted.
 <P>
<B> ???  Date?</B>  My left knee feels twisted for a week now.  I have shin 
 splints from walking around the Reichstag so much checking in with all 
 the monitor's captains and their teams.  Running them raincoats.  Suntan 
 lotion.  Work schedules.  Making them stay in couples, spread apart, 
 evenly dispersed.  Making them stand up.  Making the Captains make their 
 monitors follow the job descriptions.  The site is mobbed with people 
 which makes the going slow.  As I travel to and from work on the train, I 
 find it interesting to watch people's reaction as we curve around the 
 tracks to view the building on the other side of what looks like a waste 
 land and river.  Some people deliberately ignore it while others rush to 
 the doors and windows to focus better.  I felt quite proud.  
 <P>
<B> 2:15 p.m.</B>  I woke up about 1:00 p.m.  Suzanne and I diving quickly into a 
 deep conversation, which is the dynamics between us.  Especially because 
 we only meet in passing.  Considering I e-mailed my way into her living 
 room, we are doing well and under other circumstances (like time) I think 
 we could be great friends.  At least I don't have to worry about wearing 
 out my welcome since I'm only here to sleep and shower. Her hot water 
 only lasts about 5 minutes, too, which is a real problem with my long 
 hair. I'm waiting for the hot water to finish heating right now.  
 Showers.  What a luxury in this world.  And dry laundry.  I have to wash 
 socks by hand every day after my shift to keep the sock cycle going.  I 
 forgot Germans don't have driers.  And it's raining so much nothing's 
 drying.  And it's so damp and cold.  Suzanne has lent me lots of her warm 
 clothes.  I'm getting a care package (Goretex) from the States.  It never 
 occurred to me that I should bring camping- and hiking-type clothes to 
 work on this project.  I knew it would be cold, but not this cold and not 
 this much rain.  I have three blisters on each foot.  My feet are so 
 swollen I can't even put my boots on.  My men's style shoes are ripping 
 apart.  I may have to buy new shoes and more socks.
<P> 
 Eating nutella on luscious German bread  (when people used to survive in 
 jails on bread and water . . . it wasn't American bread!) indulging in 
 letter reading.
 <P>
 Dedication is remembering what you want.
 <P>
 Gert and I have become good friends.  He's a former East German, and I'm 
 getting an interesting perspective on what it was like before the wall 
 came down.  He's lived in Berlin for more than 10 years. When we can 
 squeak out a little time, he shows me places.  If it wasn't for him, I 
 wouldn't have seen anything except my trek back and forth to work.  
 Sometimes when we have that grueling shift that starts at 5:00 a.m., 
 he'll be waiting outside of the train station and give me a ride to save 
 me from the last 20-minute walk.  He's my partner and we've worked out a 
 good system to keep the troops in line.  We play good cop/bad cop.  The 
 workers think that I'm a real hardass.  I'm so sick of them not doing 
 their job right.  "No you can't open up your sleeping bag and sleep 
 during your shift. In fact you've been paid to stand up. No you can't 
 drink that bottle of champagne.  This isn't a party. You're supposed to 
 guard the building and be available to the public. You represent the 
 Christos."  In (what I'm learning is) typical German fashion, the 
 monitors each tell me the most optimum way they should be handling their 
 job; and me, mine.  I don't have time for these repetitive discussions.  
 I keep telling them we do what Jeanne-Claude says and anything else is 
 not an option.
 <P>
<B>22 June.</B>  More and more people coming to see the project.  We are 
 constantly having to drive off the vendors since they don't have permits. 
  We do our jobs.  They leave.  We turn the corner.  They return.  The 
 silver lady is always around.  We play "Where's Waldo."  She's actually 
 getting attention.  Apparently some people think she's related to the 
 project.  I've gotten her mannerisms down.  
 <P>
<B> 23 June.</B>  Friday  At work.  Oh god.  I have no concept of what day it is 
 anymore.  I have to ask people all the time but it doesn't stick.  Its 
 7:20 a.m.  I started work at 4:45 a.m.  Got up at 3:15 to catch the 
 bus/train/walk.  Went to bed at 10:00 last night after slamming down two 
 very tall beers and diving into deep conversations with Gert.  Gert, I 
 decided yesterday, is my best friend here.  In fact, all my closest 
 friends are men right now.  There's Ferdinand who speaks about two words 
 of English.  He was so proud of himself when he could say, "See you later 
 alligator."  Then one day I shocked him by replying, "After a while 
 crocodile." He grabbed a piece of paper and jotted it down.  And Ernst 
 (curator for a museum in Bonn) who reminds me of my father.  And of 
 course the Swiss guy who is very formal and deals with the stress and 
 sleeplessness with beer.  After a few, he's human and I like him more.  
 We are all bonding quickly because of the intensity of this job.  The 
 paperwork, the personalities.  Everyone is exhausted and getting on each 
 others nerves.
 <P>
 Gert is an excellent tour guide.  He's lived here most of his life as an 
 E-German,  but was very often in W-Berlin.  One night "check point 
 Charlie" was closed (he showed me the site) for the night and he had to 
 knock to get back into East Germany!  After hearing all the stories of 
 the lengths people went to escape, it was ironic to hear about someone 
 knocking on the door wanting to get back in to the East.  He has great 
 stories.  Their noncapitalistic perspectives are refreshing.  I see now 
 why some (former) east Germans feel jaded.  He's really sweet.  We're a 
 good team.  Helping each other out.  Covering for each other.  Dealing 
 with stress by making jokes and sometimes just giving that knowing look 
 across the room when someone is about to make a mess of things.  He tells 
 me that the mismanagement I'm witnessing is typical and the curse of 
 "perfectionist" thinking.  He thinks the Germans could learn a lot from 
 how Americans run businesses.  He seems to be familiar with some of the 
 current theories of management in the U.S.  The meetings are ridiculous, 
 starting after people have already worked 13 hours (and can't see 
 straight) often going around in circles until everyone gets fed up.  No 
 agendas.  Lots of talk.  Strategies change so often nothing ever gets 
 done.  Often Gert drives me home because I've missed the last train 
 trying to tackle some new three ring binder of paperwork that just got 
 thrown our way after a full shift and meeting.
 <P>
 I find myself drinking beer almost every day now to take the edge off the 
 stress, or to get a good six hours of sleep in broad daylight - with 
 those damn pigeons cooing only a few feet away.  At least the beer here 
 is worth drinking.
 <P>
 It's getting tougher to sit down and write.  Mostly I do it on the train 
 now.  The honeymoon, if ever there was one, is definitely over.  I've 
 only had one day of warmth and sunshine since I got here.  Any spare time 
 I have I either sleep or try and get in a little sightseeing, thanks to 
 Gert.  It rains all the time.  The cold is in my bones and I can't shake 
 it.  I'm stiff and sore from sleeping on the floor and walking around the 
 Reichstag so much.  My shoes finally disintegrated.
 <P>
 On our day off, which I spent half of sleeping, Gert took me throughout 
 Berlin, especially East Berlin, pointing out the sections of "The Wall"  
 that remain.  The images were powerful and sad not only because of the 
 subject matter, but also because they are quickly fading and flaking 
 away.  Saw some interesting architecture in East Berlin.  A lesbian bar 
 called the Whistle Stop Cafe named after Fried Green Tomatoes.  We  
went to an island in the middle of the Spree - a river.  Then a beer 
garden. More interesting conversation between East vs. West.  Capitalism vs. 
 communism/socialism.  His wife.  His child.  His parents - how they died. 
  How his father just couldn't cope with the collapse of communism and 
 wasted away first spiritually then physically.  After two to three hours,  
 I was pretty tipsy.  He took us to an authentic Russian restaurant in 
 East Berlin (phonetically) called Pasternak.  We were sitting at tables 
 on the sidewalk.  The food was fantastic.  Orange caviar on eggs, 
 stroganoff with some kind of wheat thing . . . rich beer . . . called 
 Budweiser, no less (but as different from ours as water is to,well . . . 
 beer).  Enjoying my time away from the project, I was suddenly roused 
 from my feeding frenzy when I hear my name, "Iris?," in German and looked 
 up to see my cousin from Munich!  I said, "Henrika?!!"  she said yes.  
 She's around 20 now -  shy, intellectual and nearly 6' tall.  I said "No, 
 it can't be!"  Three-and-a half-million citizens and she stumbled upon me 
 at the same restaurant while looking for a table for dinner.  Turns out 
 she's been in Berlin for a while studying at the university.  Henrika and 
 her friend joined us for dinner.
 <P>
 The next day they came to visit me at The Reichstag.  I introduced them 
 to Jeanne-Claude and was reprimanded for bringing strangers to their 
 office when everything was so busy and hectic.  Henrika and her friend 
 were thrilled never-the-less.  I gave them a couple of my signed Christo 
 postcards.  We walked around the Reichstag in extreme cold and wind.  
 Black thick clouds.  Driving rain.  I teased them about how glamorous my 
 job is.  They left right away because of the freezing weather. We 
 promised to try and meet for breakfast or lunch on Sunday.
 <P>
 Ferdinand (who reminds me of younger version of my handsome German 
 grandfather, with whom I studied as a teen-ager to learn how to smoke) 
 Ernst, Gert and I will try and have a dinner out on Tuesday 
 (Czechoslovakian or Brazilian).  They are partners - always during the 
 shift before us.  So it was difficult to come up with a time that 
 wouldn't interfere with our sleep.  I'm really looking forward to it.  I 
 need to recharge my batteries.
 <P>
<B> Another day . . . four ?</B> days ago the film crew interviewed me (after I 
 only had three and a half hours of sleep!) regarding the other projects 
 I'd worked on.  The first go around they ran out of film.  The second go 
 around they ran out of recording tape.  I probably came off like a dork.  
 We'll see later if they use any of it.  They seem to be interested in me 
 since I've worked previous projects and have dealt with sidewalks, an 
 ocean, Paris, desert climate, and now gray cold weather in my native land.
 <P>
 Gotta get to work.  Gert and I decided today I'm the mean guy and he will 
 be nice to the monitors (who are behaving worse as the days progress).  
 Tomorrow will be the opposite.  8:10 a.m.   
 <P>
<B>24 June.</B>  During our shift, around 4:00 a.m. someone shot a burning 
 arrow into the fabric from the neighboring trees/park.  Gert was out on 
 patrol and I was doing paperwork, keeping my ear to the radio.  I grabbed 
 my camera and went out for a look.  It was so unimpressive (the fabric is 
 fire retardant) that I didn't bother.  They didn't catch him.  I was 
 irked since it was our crew on duty and no one saw anything.  At that 
 time in the morning, we would constantly have to check up on them, some 
 of the monitors blatantly sleeping in sleeping bags or mats.  It's 
 becoming a constant battle.  I wish I had the power to fire people.  
 There's no leverage to make them do their job.
 <P>
 Later in the day the fence was removed since all the panels have been 
 opened.  Everyone is bracing themselves for dealing directly with the 
 public, which is increasing by thousands daily.
 <P>
 Gert and I admired the way the Reichstag transformed into Christo's 
 preliminary drawings/montage/vision.  Its a giant jewel.
<P> 	
<B>I think its the 26th.</B>  I'm having a half-liter of Becks beer and an 
 onion sandwich on stiff German bread with cheese and black peppercorns.  
 Listening to a terrific Russian Reggae (!) tape that Gert made for me.  
 Trying to unwind.  Its a serious time of reflection for me.  As with all 
 the projects, I am rejoicing in the impact of it all.  And grateful to be 
 an integral component in this art history in the making.  But, man oh 
 man, am I ready to go home.  I guess I am so high up in this hierarchy 
 that I see all the problems, but not high enough to do anything about it. 
  Telling the Christos would only stress them out more.  I've mentioned 
 things to Simon but he seems to be fed up with what ever it is he is 
 witnessing.  I keep readapting the motto "Just one day at a time."
 <P>
<B>28 June '95</B>.  Last night was particularly grueling.  It was the most 
 difficult shift as a shift leader.
 <P>
 I'm writing from a garden north of the city.  A datscha.  The Russian 
 word for a little garden with a little overnight house.  A place to get 
 away from it all.  The little house is classic late '50s.  Former East 
 Germany. I've done nothing today but relax.  After our two most disliked 
 shifts (5:00-11:00 a.m. then immediately after: 11:00 p.m. till 5:OO 
 a.m.) Gert and I left.  During this 11:00 p.m. shift we planned to catch 
 up on our paperwork, which continues to grow in responsibility daily.  
 Our plan was foiled because we weren't the only ones behind.  Other shift 
 leader partners were sitting there till 2 a.m. trying to catch up too.  
 Until they were done, we couldn't do ours.  
 <P>
 Meanwhile the happy people around the Reichstag had turned aggressive.  
 Ever-demanding crowds waiting for silver fabric swatches (1,150,000) 
 prepared for the monitors to hand out free (at an additional $48,000) for 
 souvenirs.  I was appalled at how nasty some people were.  A few days ago 
 Gert and I turned the corner to discover two of the British monitors had 
 people lined up (two by two) in a civilized queue.  They stood on the 
 steps and doled out swatches two at a time.  It was so prim and proper 
 and struck us as funny because the Brits are known for behaving 
 themselves in line.  Later we heard that a monitor found himself being 
 mobbed for swatches and in a panic threw his whole satchel as far over 
 the heads of the crowd as he could to escape their viciousness.  Today a 
 monitor showed me the bloody fingernail scratches covering her arms and 
 hands where she was mobbed by greedy people.  We decided to hold off - 
 thinking the monitors might be overwhelmed or rushed by the crowd.  It 
 was a difficult decision.  Which way would the public be more aggressive?
 <P>
 Shortly after the shift change at 11 p.m., the problems started.  I made 
 my first round.  A group of skin heads - walking in a pack - began 
 harassing the monitors.  I spotted an arrogant man faking drunkenness 
 with his lover,  while cupping a knife in his hand.  Caressing and 
 pressing his body against the fabric he kept trying to cut it - testing 
 the stiff fabric with his small knife.  Gert and I tailed him - monitors 
 were warned by us through our talkie-walkies (that's what they keep 
 calling them!).  The police were dealing with the skin heads in a polite 
 and restrained fashion.  One in particular was a real asshole.  I tailed 
 him from a distance.  Drunk and belligerent he began picking a fight with 
 a 40-year-old female monitor.  I called for backup, but the radio was 
 jammed with urgent requests overlapping each other, creating 
 incomprehensible snippets.  Finally I got through describing which facade 
 he was on (a nightmare for any one since their names challenged even the 
 non-dyslexic: Ost (east) facade Nord (north), Ostfassade Sud (south), 
 Sudfassade Ost, Sudfassade West, Westfacade Sud, and so on) while tailing 
 him.  The woman handled it well.  He moved on to the next monitor and 
 tried to pick a fight with him.  The police finally arrived (I'd followed 
 him half way around the building, squeezing through the crowd) and he 
 fought them immediately.  Holding on to the back of his neck, they lead 
 him away. He frequently pulled up his feet like a belligerent child.  I 
 was impressed with how the police were practicing enormous restraint.
 <P>
 Some of the monitors were really shook up.  The skinheads looked pretty 
 intimidating.  
 <P>
 Made another half-round patrol and heard over the radio that someone had 
 projected something onto the front of the Reichstag.  I didn't know what 
 to expect when I rounded the corner.  To my surprise and pleasure (though 
 we knew it had to be turned off) someone had managed to set up a million 
 watts (or so) of light behind two slides and projected a drawing of the 
 front facades of the Reichstag onto the Reichstag. The really impressive 
 thing was, it was totally to scale on the first attempt.  The drawing of 
 all the windows and portals were in the exact location of the originals 
 under the silver/gray fabric.  It lasted about 15 minutes.
 <P>
 Christo and Jeanne-Claude share the same birthday, June 13, 1935.  She 
 recently turned 60.  My office wanted to throw a party for her (Christo 
 was in the states).  I advised them against it since Christo wasn't there 
 and she probably wouldn't appreciate us not focusing on the project.  The 
 parties could come afterwards. Better to keep the ball rolling and not 
 pause.  Then she came down with a fever and bronchitis and didn't look 
 well at all.  We heard Jeanne-Claude was ordered to stay in her hotel for 
 three days.  All these events made me reflect.  I'd always assumed I'd 
 work on their projects forever.  I'd never thought about the fact that 
 there will come a time when there won't be any more projects.  It 
 reminded me of a trip home once, after I hadn't been home in a few years 
 and I realized with a jolt in my heart and stomach that my mother looked 
 older and things would not remain the same for the rest of my life.  I 
 forgot they are vulnerable like everyone else.  And with so much at 
 stake.  I worried about her.    
 <P>
 We had expected Jeanne-Claude to be out and about last night.  The 
 garbage that people left around the building and lawn was incredible.  I 
 was shocked.  This place is beginning to remind me of a cross between 
 Disney World and Woodstock.  Disney because of the holiday type of 
 feeling and all the children, families, etc.  Woodstock because of all 
 the camp fires, drinking and how about that strip tease in front of the 
 Reichstag's lights.  It was projected two or so stories!  (Did the 
 Christos hear about all this?)  The captains and especially the monitors 
 are getting more and more difficult to handle.  Too many of them are 
 developing the attitude that it is all a big party.  The captains are, in 
 general, the same age as their monitors and as a result the captains are 
 more concerned with being liked;  several just don't have any authority 
 in their personalities.  The most successful groups appear to be the ones 
 where the captains are older.  
 <P>
 The Christos were scheduled to do autographs at dawn; people were already 
 camping out in line by 1:00 a.m.  There were several camps in the round - 
 strewn all over the grounds.  Guitars and bad off-key versions of 
 Stairway to Heaven.  Other camps consisted of drunken belligerent men 
 with their women supporting them.
 <P>
 Gert got stuck in some problem involving the que that had grown one and a 
 half times around the Reichstag.  Instead of being done and heading off 
 to breakfast at 5:30 a.m.  it was 6:30.  Odd . . . these breakfasts.  
 Sometimes they are left over dinners during this time of the day.
 <P>
 Afterwards we hopped in the car and escaped north into the country side 
 and his datscha, where I'm writing now.  I could hardly keep my eyes 
 open.  Arrived at 7:30 a.m.  He opened the doors and windows to the 
 little house.  It was cold.  We were wasted, having used our last 
 strength to complete the paperwork at the end of our shift.  I parked a 
 lawn chair in the sun, wound a blanket around me and fell into an 
 exhausted sleep for three and a half hours. I woke up to the sound of 
 bumblebees, not pigeons.
 <P>
 Around noon, he got some breakfast and dinner fixings.  I took a shower 
 (and can't wait for one of my 20 -minute showers at home) and changed 
 into shorts while he was gone.  Gert wouldn't let me do a thing all day.  
 The breakfast was a typical German spread.  Spent the day sunning, 
 touring the yard/garden, talking, looking at books and basically trying 
 to relax and forget about the project for a while.  Finally, I was warm.
 <P>
 In the evening, we had a specially grilled pork chop kind of a thing.  
 Our discussion about his marriage and its unhappiness.  I just don't 
 understand why so many people stay in bad marriages.
 <P>
 Its 8 p.m. and he's packing up the house.  We're touring the country side 
 before we drive back into the city.   
 <P>
<B>Date?</B>  Tonight truly had to be the night from hell.  After working all 
 night, with other shift leaders backed up in the office with paperwork, 
 we heard that the president of Germany (not the Chancellor) was to visit 
 the project site around 7:00 am.  The site would obviously have to be in 
 tip top shape.  At around the end of our shift, it was obvious that the 
 trash collectors (big trucks with vacuum hoses and brushes) had missed a 
 large amount of garbage.  We'd been ordered to have the monitors pick up 
 trash in their section.  Gert distributed the bags.  Instead of 
 cooperation, we heard from most of the monitors that to pick up trash was 
 beneath them and also not included in the job description.  At the same 
 time, the trash trucks were stalled at the flagpole site (directly in the 
 front of the building) because some belligerent drunk had collected trash 
 (99 percent beer, wine and champagne bottles), which he'd placed on the 
 flag pole cement island as "art."  He refused to allow the trash 
 collectors to sweep up the bottles.  They tried convincing him and he 
 discovered suddenly he had an audience.  Getting more and more rowdy, he 
 wrote something on a poster board and tied it to the flag pole.  Then 
 started in his drunken drawl to lecture to everyone who'd gathered to 
 photograph him and listen.  The police was called to intervene on the 
 trash collectors behalf.  Meanwhile, all the monitors from that side of 
 the building heard about the commotion and started drifting to that 
 location, abandoning their positions and still not picking up any trash. 
 <P>
 Gert and I were trying to rustle them up and back into their positions 
 when, on the opposite side of the Reichstag, someone was hit on their 
 bicycle and was apparently bleeding.  The ambulance was called.  On the 
 radio, several urgent messages were going out when, somehow, one of the 
 monitors got on with a speech about "how dare we worry about garbage when 
 some one was lying there bleeding to death" (an exaggeration). We cringed 
 knowing the media was listening and probably the Christos, too.  This 
 person had jammed up all the radios and wouldn't get off the air.  
 Horrified, Gert and I were frantically trying to find the source.  In the 
 middle of all this chaos, guess who drove up in a limo . . .
<P> 
<B>Date?</B>  I was making my rounds squeezing through the crowd, when I 
 noticed everyone's attention was to my right.  I turned to see a man had 
 planted an A-frame ladder right next to me, climbed to the top (with his 
 back to the project) and dropped his coat.  His pale white hairy body was 
 clothed only in black nylon socks and shoes.  His friend on the ground 
 took a picture of him with the building in the background.  The Berlin 
 police stood politely by waiting for him to finish and get down.  Putting 
 on his coat, he was gently escorted to the trees on the edge of the park, 
 where they obviously wrote him a ticket.  It was all so civilized and 
 polite.  Somewhere in the distance there was the sound of a Bolivian pan 
 pipe group performing.
 <P>
A couple of days before leaving.  I've started saying my goodbyes, 
 taking my last pictures, briefly chatting to people that I hadn't had a 
 chance to say hi to, and hoping to hook up with the Christos.  All 
 together, during the course of this month, I've maybe said three 
 sentences to them as the projects are the worst time to try and 
 socialize.  Ironically they were briskly walking past the project.  I 
 caught up with them and asked what they thought now after all those years 
 of hard work (more than 20).  They were beaming with pride.  She spoke 
 briefly about the birthing pains involved with these projects.  Telling 
 them I was leaving soon, they hooked me up with one of Christo's private 
 tours of the interior of the building.  I donned a construction hat and 
 took two trips.  The first to hear the details, the second to spiritually 
 experience it.
 <P>
 The inside of the building was stripped bare to the stone.  Enormous 
 cables penetrated the ceilings, and came in the windows to hold the ropes 
 and silver fabric tight to the building. There were also concrete and 
 steel weights.  Apparently, many of the ropes had to be continuously 
 adjusted as they stretched out from the weight and wind.The inner court 
 yards were as magical as I'd imagined. I took several photos of the 
 architecture and the American ambassador and his family, who were the 
 focus of the tour. Taking the elevator to the top floor, we ascended the 
 stairs and climbed up onto the roof.  It was a shimmering, surreal 
 landscape.  Minimalistic and elegant.  If I'd had wings, I would have 
 flown in circles down the fabric lined inner courtyards.  It felt so safe 
 up there.  Below, in another world, you could hear the hundreds of 
 thousands of people milling around the building. 
 <P>
<B>July 6.</B> The unwrapping of the Reichstag has begun and I'm going home to 
 Georgia.
  <P>
 Final thoughts:  While I found working on the project grueling in terms 
 of hours and pressures, I can't adequately describe the honor and 
 satisfaction that I've experienced in being able to participate in such 
 incredibly important historical event.  During some of my most annoyed 
 and exhausted moments I've reflected on what it must (by comparison) be 
 like for Christo and Jeanne-Claude, striving to make their visions 
 tangible.  The enormous responsibility of it must, at times, be overwhelming.

<H3>Tom Bodett on: <BR>
Tom Bodett and <BR>
The Free Fall of Webster Cummings</H3>
<P>

Bodett's fourth book, <i>The Free Fall of Webster Cummings  </i> (Hyperion, $22.95), is a novel about a man  who survives an impossible fall from a commuter plane and the strange people his accident brings together. 
<P>
Bodett hosts the radio program <i>The End of the Road, </i >lives in Homer, Alaska; and he serves as a contributing editor to Alaska magazine. Apparently he also frequently visits  Motel 6.
<P>
<br clear=all>
<hr width=75%>
<P>
With half my life spent living in Alaska, there is no mystery to why I've devoted most of my writing and radio attention to the peculiarities of my Alaskan existence.  But I've never forgotten where I came from and, like most Alaska immigrants, my roots continue to petition for equal time.
<P>
Raised in Michigan and funneled to Alaska through a series of misguided adventures across America and through the Northwest, I arrived in Alaska in 1976 and never looked back.  Or that's what I like to say, anyway.  But I did look back.  Do look back.  And I see my old friends change and my parents grow old and the America I left behind becoming something else and even from my rarefied Alaskan perch I have to admit that it's the most interesting situation I've ever come across.  So I had to send a couple emissaries down to test the waters.
<P>
Ed Flannigan went first.  One arm, no job, no clue.  I wondered what would happen if the last of the real Alaskan men wound up in Quartz Creek, Oregon, a crystal-twirling new age power colony.  He is tested to the breaking point by the foreign challenges of organic farming, a born again and again channeler who thinks she knew him in another life, and a cranky little guardian angel who lives in his peach trees.
<P>
The next one out was Norman Tuttle, sixteen now and pretty much reduced to a raging hormone.  Norman gets lost in the jungles of adolescence in his little Alaska world and only finds his way by getting himself exiled from Alaska to a summer in the Lower 48.  What do sex, rock-n-roll and family secrets have to do with growing up in America?  Well, just about everything as it turns out.
<P>
Once Ed and Norman got my attention turned South, there was no going back.  Everywhere I looked there were fascinating characters buried behind the faces of ordinary people.
<P>
Lloyd and Evelyn Decker, retired and bored out of their seventy-year-old wits in Avalon, Ohio.  With a daughter playing logger in Oregon and a son who stalled and pumps gas in Booder, Indiana, they've run out of reasons to stay home.  Prepared for anything but the truth, they strike out in a powder blue Road Ranger motor home to see the America they never knew and remind themselves what their children look like.
<P>
Separated by more than the hyphens in their names, Richard and Katherine Bedinger-Hoople struggle to maintain two high-powered careers on both coasts while nurturing a pregnancy, a promotion, and a modern America relationship with cellular phones and flier miles.
<P>
I've always wondered who those people in the big coats shuffling by with their shopping carts are talking to.  It might be to Oliver the Dreamer, the soft spoken amnesiac who lives under a bridge in Seattle with his homeless family of friends.  Oliver's soiled associates--the original John Doe, voluntary vagrant Arthur P. Tender III, and poor mad Ramona--give the ragged edges of America a new and unexpected dimension.
<P>
Even a social climbing student of ambition like Buddy Bedinger stands to learn from the forgotten poor.  Lessons Buddy fails to learn as he works his way through law school and a parade of wealthy clientele as a room service waiter at the grand Merrimont Hotel in Seattle.
<P>
I suppose the thing that amazes me the most about the America I see from here is how much all these incredibly distinct characters have in common with each other and--even after twenty years in Alaskan exile--with me.  Is there a common American heart?  Or is this just the illusion created by the small world syndrome?  If it's true that we're only six people away from knowing anybody in the country, then Webster Cummings is the one everybody must know.
<P>
After surviving a mile-high fall from a commuter flight over New Hampshire, Webster is shaken from his plodding existence as a statistical research analyst and moved to seek out once and for all the identities of his biological parents.  His discoveries prove the Sherlock Holmes' theory:  once you've eliminated all possibilities, the answer must be the impossible.
<P>
In the America I see from here, anything is possible.  Especially the impossible.  As Webster's search becomes our odyssey he draws my scattered American brood to one inevitable conclusion in a most unlikely place a long way from home.
<P>
But for me, that's what this story is really about:  leaving home.  Leaving home and coming home and trying to understand the difference.  I think E. W. Howe said it best:  The worst thing in the world is the homesickness that comes over a man occasionally when he is at home.

<H3>Margaret Visser on: TAKING A SHOWER</H3>


When showers began to be promoted in Europe in the mid-nineteenth century, they were cold, and believed to be dangerous if not managed correctly. But they had the advantage of being cheap. People might submit to them because their betters had decided they needed a wash: prisons and armies enforced rules such as "a shower once a fortnight, a foot-bath once a week." Files of unwilling bodies were firmly marched under jets of icy water, directed by men standing on ladders. With eight being doused simultaneously, about a hundred could be washed in one hour with no more water than that required to fill eight bathtubs.
<P>
But douches, in the hands of the experts, could equally well become "water cures," in which sprays were aimed at those parts of the body requiring healing. The problem was always water pressure. Some hydropathic establishments installed a high water tank beneath which a patient stood for a "regenerative" shower. A valve opened at the pull of a cord and let the water fall. Patients had to wear hard hats to protect their heads.
<P>
Shower-takers also attempted the difficult task of keeping their feet dry, for this was thought to lessen the shock. One stood stooped forward on a dry carpeted stool in a shallow round tub or hip bath. A tank of water, of the same volume as the tub or less, was supported on a tripod over ones head. First the water had to be hand-pumped from a bucket up a pipe and into the tank. Then, after mustering courage, one tugged a chain, and the water descended.
<P>
Devices that sprayed rather than doused people were known at first as rain baths; one of these was the "shower bath ring" in which a perforated tube was worn round the neck and water supplied to it by a pipe leading from the bath tap: in this manner a bather could be surrounded by a private rain storm, while keeping the head dry. Showers have until very recently been a mainly male choice, tough and swift, forceful and athletic; women have tended to engage in longer, gentler grooming rituals, which typically include bath-tub soaking.
<P>
Cold showers were frequently taken after hot baths, by people rich enough to command a hot bath, for the sake of health rather than of cleanliness. Ever since Homeric times, warm baths have been a sign, in the West, of "soft," luxurious, and therefore slightly wicked living. It has often been felt that cold water ought to suffice, and that habituating oneself to cold water might build character. Hot baths were often thought therefore to require cold showers afterwards, to "close the pores" of the skin and put an end to too much hedonism. (People will put up with a cold shower where they draw the line at a cold bath.)
<P>
Lying in a hot bath used to be one of the ways in which one warmed up in a  mostly unheated house. For showering all year round in cold climates to become popular, we required not only the arrival of water pipes at all houses and water pressure strong enough to drive water automatically up to the shower head, but also water heaters and central heating. In most places, the fashion for habitual showering has really arrived only within the last forty years.
<P>
Baths have now become comparatively old fashioned. Many of us never use a bathtub except as somewhere to stand when showering. Lying down in hot water is time-consuming, peaceful, and passive. (In our family one "has" a bath but "takes" a shower.) Showers, now routinely used by women as well as men, are brisk, active, and thought of as quick-- though many people, especially the young, are reputed to stand for longer and longer periods of time under the shower.
<P>
Though most of us are quite clean to start with, we feel that bathing means sitting in our own dirty water, whereas showers carry the dirt straight off and down the plug-hole. The preference for showering over bathing has resulted in a small but definite change in behavior: where once we used to fill a basin of water in order to wash our hands, we are now more likely to soap them under a running tap.
<P>
People wash their hair more often today than they have ever done in history. The recent invention of extra-gentle shampoo is the reason we can do this almost every day without damaging our scalps , and showers both encourage the habit and are demanded by it. Shower caps have meanwhile gone to live with hair rollers.
<P>
Many of us cannot imagine leaving the house without a shower; others shower in the evening, dispelling the grime and unpleasantness of the working day. Modern life is founded on an enormous opposition between the public and private realms of every human life. Showers have become rituals of passage for us, from one realm to the other. They reassure us that we are not grubby or smelly, and are therefore either restored to privacy or acceptable in public. They purify us as aspersions of water have done in religious ritual; they "make us feel good."

<H3>Margaret Visser on:  SEEING RED</H3>



Shaking a blue rag at a bull enrages the bull - as would shaking a green rag, a yellow rag, or a mauve one. When we wish to infuriate bulls, however, we shake red rags, or red-lined matadors capes, because we think red is the appropriately irritating colour. Bulls themselves are indifferent to colour, and just hate the flapping. 
<P>
Human beings have endowed the colour red with more connotations than those of any other colour. Indeed, red used to be really the only colour. Before the discovery of the spectrum in the seventeenth century, all other colours tended to be considered variations of either black (brown, blue, green, violet) or white (yellow, beige, cream, and other very pale tints). Our colour range therefore was black - red - white. There were also "reds" like salmon and pink; copper tones, and often gold, also counted as red (hence Red Indian, and "not a red cent"). 
<P>
In several tongues "coloured" means only "red," like colorado in Spanish. Many languages use surprisingly few colour terms, but all of them include black and white, and nearly all have red. In English, only three colours become verbs by adding -en: blacken, redden, whiten. Wine and grape language also preserves the three-term range: there are all the different "reds" (rose is a recent appellation); but "white wine" is actually yellow; and "black" grapes are not really black.
<P>
Red is most fundamentally associated with blood and with fire, and each of those mighty preoccupations can be either terrifying or a basic good - so that the ramifications of red, both positive and negative, are extraordinarily complex and resonant. Red is alive, and vibrant. Angry people go red in the face; embarrassment causes us to blush (a word linked with "blaze": red as both blood and fire). Artists know that red looks warm, present, and near; it attracts.
<P>
It also marks things out, and has therefore become an internationally agreed signal of danger and of prohibition: stop signs, red pencils, being in debt or "in the red." Red as "blood" is for war and wounds (the Red Cross), violent criminals (caught "red-handed"), and also Christ's redeeming blood. Christian liturgical red means the blood of martyrs, and the fiery Holy Spirit. Fire engines and fire extinguishers say "fire," of course, and "danger," but also "here we are when you need us," and "we are all of us vigorously intent on putting out the flames."
<P>
The dynamism of red, together with its warnings of blood and fire, make it the colour of revolutions, angry people on the march - and finally of Communism and the Left generally. Canadas Liberal Party, like Toronto's York University, uses red mostly by default: calm, status-quo blue, the modern West's favourite colour, is bespoken by the opposition. Yet in adopting red for their colour both institutions place themselves, however slightly, left of conservative.
<P>
Red is the colour of passion: hearts, sentiment (the red, red rose); and of eroticism, sexual transgression, prostitution. It riots in red-light districts, red underwear, lipstick, and rouge. Red, like ripe fruit, arouses the appetite; gules, the heraldic term for red, is cognate with "gullet."
<P>
Red clothes make wearers stand out in a crowd, and (if we discount "imperial purple" which was made from extravagant numbers of sea snails) for at least three thousand years red was the most fast and successful dye. A great ancient red was kermes, made from the pregnant females of insects that live on a species of oak. Ancient Sanskrit had one word for both "worm" and "insect": both "kermes" and "crimson" came via Arabic from the Sanskrit word that gave us"worm," and so did vermilion,"little worm." In The Book of Exodus, the word for redness in dyed stuffs similarly comes from the Hebrew for"worm." Mexico later gave Europe cochineal (from the Spanish word for"wood louse") which is made of the dried bodies of insects found on cacti.
<P>
Red dresses and shawls, red shirts and cummerbunds were for "best" wear, and for feasts. (Scarlet was originally a superb woollen cloth, so expensive that it was often dyed red: the colour took the name of the cloth.) The wearing of a white wedding dress is a relatively recent custom. One of the earliest"white wedding" gowns on record (the bride appeared complete with tulle veil and pearl tiara) dates from the year 1800 in Charleston, South Carolina. But a bride, until well into the nineteenth century, would usually put on her very best dress for her wedding, or wear the robust, celebratory version of her national costume; it was normally brightly coloured, therefore, and often at least partly red.
<P>
The festive meaning makes red one of the two Christmas colours, favoured for balloons, paper hats, candies, ribbons, and other decorations-- but also there is fire (warmth in the depth of winter), new life (in the"death" of darkness), love (the main Christian message), and even eroticism, for the rubicund Santa Clause is, as we have seen, a fertility figure, and grossly phallic.

<H2>JIMMY DEAN: MY KIND OF GUY</H2>
<H3><I>by Janus Eidus</I></H3>
<P>
Jimmy and I met at that really famous artists' colony, the one that's been around for a hundred years. I was there to paint landscapes; Jimmy, to write a play. He announced this at dinner, his first night there. He'd grown tired of film acting, he said. He described scenes he'd been forced to play all wrong in East Of Eden  and Rebel Without A Cause, scenes he'd wanted to play tough, but which the director had made him play sensitive, and other scenes he'd wanted to play sensitive, but the director had made him go all steely and macho. "I want to be my own boss," he said, downing his third glass of red wine, "to write, direct, and star in my own play. And don't worry, it'll be a real work of art," he added, as though any of us at the dinner table that night would have doubted his artistry.
<P>
I was the only woman at the table. That was because, out of the twenty-or-so of us in residence at the artists' colony at the time, there were five gay men there, all of whom had major crushes on Jimmy, and all of whom had made beelines for Jimmy's table. "Jimmy is our idol," they'd informed me, the night before his arrival, "with those soulful eyes, that perky nose, that rebel mouth. We believe that in his heart, he's one of us -- whether he really is or not." The five of them, plus Jimmy, equalled six, exactly the number of chairs at the dinner table. But there was no way -- on Jimmy's first night at the colony -- that I was going to sit at one of the other tables, trapped next to Olga, for instance, the photographer known for her pictures of human fingers and toes. After all five of the men and Jimmy were comfortably seated, I squeezed in a seventh chair. I wanted Jimmy. I intended to have him. Not for eternity. Just for my stay at the artists' colony. 
<P>
All week long, before Jimmy's arrival at the colony, the five men -- each of whom I had become good friends with -- had argued over which of them Jimmy would sleep with first. "Me, first, definitely," insisted Gregory, in a state of near-rapture. "I'll win him over with my music." Gregory, a composer, was smug because his works had been performed by The New York Philharmonic. "No, me first," argued Paul, belligerently. Paul was a poet who wore round, clear-framed eyeglasses that slipped down his nose. "Remember, guys," he added, "I'm the film buff in this crowd. Jimmy and I will bond." They were all wrong, but I never said so aloud. It would be me first. 
<P>
Jimmy Dean was ambivalent, ambiguous, tortured, talented, tormented, gorgeous, and non-committal, and I always click with those guys right away. We see in each other the same swirling, relentless inner turmoil that devours our souls, the same wild desires that drive us so hard, but that are too huge, too scary, even to name. "We have no skin," a former lover once said to me, "there's nothing between us and everything else."  I don't know where that former lover is now, of course. I never expected to be with him forever. I never want forever -- with anyone. I'm not that kind of girl. And none of them are that kind of guy. We know that perfection can't last. But we wouldn't exchange our one perfect moment together for a lifetime of anything less.
<P>
And I was right: When Jimmy's eyes met mine across the dinner table his first night at the artists' colony, we clicked, clicked, clicked, like a TV remote control gone wild. He just kept talking, though, like nothing out of the ordinary had happened, regaling us with some dishy anecdote about Natalie Wood, Sal Mineo, a bathtub, and a French poodle. He didn't miss a beat. I could tell that not one of the five men sitting at the table with us had any idea what had just happened. After we'd all finished our beef goulash -- the colony chef's special, prepared in honor of Jimmy's arrival -- I got up from the table and walked outside into the warm summer air, strolling purposefully through the dark woods back to my studio. All I had to do was wait. I sat in my chair in the center of the studio, staring at my own moody paintings hanging on the walls. Moments later, I heard Jimmy's knock on the door. The artists' colony rules strictly forbade residents from conducting love affairs on the premises, and even rebel-without-a-cause Jimmy followed the rules. So he and I hopped onto his motorcyle and drove into town. We booked ourselves a cozy room in a charming Victorian-style hotel, where, within moments, we ended up naked, entwined, on top of a postcard-pretty, four-poster bed. 
<P>
And in that bed, all night long, Jimmy said all the right things, the things a girl like me just loves to hear. "I don't know who I am," he whispered, staring into my eyes and stroking my lips. His sultry whisper made me even more desirous. Our lovemaking grew wilder. He clawed my back, drawing blood. He cried out, "I'm in agony. I want this, but I want that, too. Hold me," he commanded, "tighter, tighter, even tighter, really tight, hurt me," he said, flinging himself across the four-poster bed. "No, no, let me hurt you," he changed his mind, and then, "No! No, let's not hurt each other, let's just lie here and cuddle like two innocent schoolchildren, okay?" He grew insecure. He sat up. "You like this, don't you?" he asked. "Oh yes," I answered. I grew nervous: "Jimmy, am I a good lover?" "You bet," he sighed. We knew how to drive each other crazy with lust, how to play on each others' fears, how to reassure each other tenderly, over and over, all night long. 
<P>
After that, we spent every night together for the rest of my stay at the artists' colony. We always went back to the room with the fourposter bed, other than one Saturday night, when, just for kicks, we went to a sleazy motel on the highway. By the time my residency had ended, I'd completed over a dozen landscapes, one of which -- the most violent and ambiguous -- I gave to Jimmy as a parting gift. Jimmy was scheduled to stay on at the colony for two more weeks. He kissed me at the bus station. "My play is almost finished," he said. I nodded, kissing his fingers in farewell one by one, wishing that Olga, the photographer, was there to capture with her camera my lips on his beautiful fingers. 
<P>
Sometimes, after lovemaking, Jimmy had told me that his play was about a Brooklyn cabdriver named Antonio who yearns to be a boxer. Other times he'd said it was about a young girl named Antoinette who yearns for the love of a tough guy named Tony who won't give her the time of day. Honestly, it didn't matter to me what Jimmy's play was about, or whether he was even writing a play. It also didn't matter to me that -- after I'd left the artists' colony and had returned to my gloomy Manhattan studio, where I began a series of black-on-black urban streetscapes -- Jimmy began to spend his nights on the fourposter bed with Gregory and Paul, and even with Olga, on one or two occasions. Jimmy and I hadn't had that kind of relationship: it hadn't been about possession, `till death do us part, meeting the in-laws, houses with picket fences, children, and grandchildren. The only thing that mattered to me then -- the only thing that matters to me still -- is that Jimmy Dean was my kind of guy.

<H2>Eleven Missing Days in Istanbul<BR>
(Memoirs of an Amnesiac: 11 Questions) </H2>
<H3><I>by Christy Sheffield Sanford</I></H3>
<P>
Having just mailed the completed <i>Murder on the Orient Express  </i>to her publisher, Agatha Christie was relaxing in a mauve peignoir in her suite at the Pera Palas hotel.  That afternoon Ali Firath, a rail engineer she'd quizzed in her mystery research, had paid a visit and offered her an extraordinary....
<P>

<b>THE FACTS</b>
<P>
<font size=+3>1)</font> Who Dropped the Handkerchief Initialed A.?  Opium on the Bosphorus, eleven days  of dreaming.  The most liquid time of my life. We would climb into his barque and float for hours.  But I must start at the beginning.  From the first, Ali Firath, educated at Oxford and fluent in French, reminded me of my detective Poirot.  Uncanny.  Ali was exactly as I'd imagined Hercule: slight physique, egg shaped bald head and a luxuriant shiny black mustache, that one instinctively wanted to stroke. 
<P>
<font size=+3>2)</font> The Pipe-Cleaner?  Was It Dropped by Colonel Christie ?  Or By a Rogue?  I had interviewed Ali at length on the Orient Express.  He'd come to my compartment and we had sipped Chartreuse, just as I'd imagined doing with Hercule.  Ah, what 
a weakness he had for sweets, he would bring me Turkish delight.  Boxes of it.  What decadence.  But I'm skipping ahead.  If Sir Maxwell had only known but  he was on a dig along the Straits of the Dardanelles.  
<P>
<font size=+3>3)</font> Who Wore the Electric Purple Kimono?  Istanbul was not my first episode of amnesia.  In 1926, I was still married to Colonel Christie.  I had visited my cousin in the country and returned unexpectedly to find the Colonel in bed with my red-headed secretary, half his age.  He was snoring with a smile on his face.  My green brocade spread was in a heap on the carpet.  I jumped in the sedan and drove to the edge of a Yorkshire cliff.  I remember pounding my head against the steering wheel.  I wanted to gun the accelerator but couldn't, and realizing my cowardice, again banged my head.  Exhausted, I climbed into the back seat and promptly fell asleep.  I awoke to stars and a radiant half moon.  I alighted, stretched and as if in a trance, began a trek down a cliffside path.  I walked most of the night.  Then gazing at the stars, I fell asleep on a grassy knoll. 
<P>
<font size=+3>4)</font> Who Was Masquerading as Engineer/Opium Dealer?  At dawn the next morning my foot was nudged by a man with a rifle.  A feather floated onto my face.  The partridge hunter--Trevor was his name--was holding a bird by the neck.  Helping me to my feet, he insisted on befriending me.  He seemed a bit crazed and talked incessantly whether I answered or not.  At first, this was comforting as I knew nothing to say.  But I began to chafe when he insisted I stay up all hours while he read me his memoirs.  
<P>
<font size=+3>5)</font> Why Are the Hands of My Diamond Wristwatch Frozen at 2:40 A.M.?  One night Trevor read, "My Life As an Infantryman."   He'd shot a soldier in the back and felt ashamed, though this act had won him a medal for bravery.  Suddenly I recalled the endless war stories of the Colonel, my husband who had killed me with his infidelity.  I dashed out the front door, Trevor in hot pursuit.  "Why are you escaping?" he yelled.  Then I realized, he'd planned to keep me there.  I began 
to run in earnest.  He went into the house and as I glanced over my shoulder, 
I saw him standing on his stoop with a rifle.  I ducked behind a tree as shot exploded against the bark.  He began to chase me and I began to sprint.  I thought, "He's just trying to scare me."  A rain of pings whizzed by my ear.  A pellet lodged in my hair.  I screamed.  Shocked, Trevor stood still and began 
to cry.  I kept running.  I reached a Yorkshire hotel at midnight--my body covered with bramble scratches.  Recognizing me, the innkeeper said, "You've been missing a fortnight, Miss Christie.  We suspected foul play." 
 <P>
<b>THE EVIDENCE</b>
<P>
<font size=+3>6)</font> Was a Murder Committed at 2:40 A.M.?  This amnesic episode hardly compared to the fugue I suffered in '32.  As I said, Ali had come to Pera Palas.  With him, I  felt a sense of eerie equality, never experienced with another man.  "Agatha,"  he said, "I know you have an affection, a deep involvement with The East.  I want you to share an experience with me.  I hold you in great esteem; you will  be perfectly safe.  You must try the essence of the poppy, the potion that has elevated the language of poets and been the utter downfall of the weak.  I have   taken the drug three times without lingering cravings.  I can protect you from yourself, if necessary."  "No addiction, whatsoever?" I asked.  "Pr&eacute;cis&eacute;ment.  I will be your incorruptible guide."  
<P>
<font size=+3>7)</font> Could the Death Have Occurred Earlier?  Could the Victim Have Been Already Dead?  As one might imagine, with me to whom he was wildly attracted, the fourth time was his downfall.  I have a fleeting image of myself slipping into my hotel in the middle of the night like a hooligan.  Room 411 of Pera Palas became our den.  Endless hot baths and the hookah.  My apples, tea and writing implements beside the tub, undisturbed for eleven days.  And Ali rubbing my feet until I fell asleep or had another spontaneous orgasm.  The slightest descent into the crevice between my toes was intoxicating.  Everything seemed part of a skein and I would wake drifting toward one of the Princes' Islands in the Sea of Marmara-- the sun burning away the night mist from yet another castle.  
<P>
<font size=+3>8)</font> Could the Victim Have Revived at a Later Time, Minutes or Years Later?   Hercule, I mean Ali, began a recurrent theme: "Marry me."  "That would be bigamy," I said laughing.  "No, marry me here under different laws, we will disappear into a northern city."  He whispered in my hair, "No one will find you."  I remember our rail trip through the country where the terrain looked like giant phallic out-croppings.  Were my distorted visions due to euphoria?  A man, who'd sneaked out a compartment window was apprehended atop the train.  "An opium smuggler?" I asked, giggling.  My engineer said, "Shhhh," and then giggled back.  He, in his own dream world, was taking me home to meet his mother. 
<P>
<font size=+3>9)</font> Are We Certain the Victim Was Stabbed by Only One Perpetrator?  I had decided to marry him.  Insane, of course.  At the time, I thought it logical.  My deductive powers were at a standstill.  When we entered his house, he tried to introduce me to his mother; she began shouting at him in Turkish--a shrill kind of yam-mering.  Dressed all in black, she was wearing a veil.  I stood detached, watching her tantrum, then she began to pound on my back with a broomsedge as if to sweep me from her sight.  Roused from my delicious stupor, I felt an instant fury.  I began to beat her with my fists as though I'd studied boxing.  Suddenly I was Dempsey unleashed.  Then she fell and began to groan and curse.  I slumped to the floor, spent.  Ali picked me up and I woke at the Pera Palas.  I did not regain this memory until four days before my death.  
<P>
<b>HERCULE POIROT LIES DOWN AND THINKS</b>
<P>
<font size=+3>10)</font> How Else Could One Explain the Variety of Wounds?  After my last book was written, I heard from Ali.  He said, "You were the love of my life."  "Why did you disappear?" I asked.  "You mentioned Sir Max in a dream, I thought it meant you loved him."  "And your mother?" I asked, "how is she?"  "Dead, of course," he said, rather startled.
<P>
<font size=+3>11)</font> Was the Distorted Vision Due to Euphoria?  Several years elapsed and then four days before I died, it dawned on me.  "Did I kill her?  Did I kill her?"  I kept asking my niece and she kept telling everyone that I was demented and delirious.  Because, you see, I was giggling like a child.

<H3>The opening of The Yellow Arrow by Victor Pelevin<BR>
as translated from the Russian by Andrew Bromfield</H3>

Victor Pelevin named his novel, <i>The Yellow Arrow </i>(New Directions, $17.95), after a long-distance Russian train that has a ruined bridge for its destination. Its journey has no beginning, no end and the train makes no stops along the way. Written in the post-Communist perestroika year of 1993, the novel is underpinned by the familiar Russian flavor - porridge, vodka, tea and envy - and by the never-ending turning of the wheels.  Pelevin, a resident of Moscow, won Russia's "Little Booker" Prize in 1993 for <i>The Blue Lantern, </i> a collection of stories.

Andrei was woken by the usual morning noises: cheerful conversation in the toilet queue, which already  filled the corridor, the desperate crying of a child behind the thin partition wall, and his neighbor's snoring, For several minutes he attempted to struggle against the onset of day, but then the radio came on and began playing music that sounded like it was being poured into the atmosphere from a huge saucepan by some gigantic cook.
<P>
"The most important thing," said the invisible speaker right behind his head, "is the mood in which you enter on the new morning. Popular Estonian singer Guna Tamas wishes you a relaxed and joyful day, filled with sunshine."
<P>
Andrei swung his legs down on to the floor and felt for his shoes. Petr Sergeievich was still snoring on the bunk bed opposite. Judging from the energetic heaving of his shoulders and backside under the sheet marked with blue triangular stamps, he intended to spend at least another hour in the embrace of sleep. Petr Sergeievich was clearly impervious to Guna Tamas's morningtime greetings and the voices in the corridor, but his invisible armour was no help to anyone else., and for Andrei the new day had irrevocably begun.
<P>
Dressing quickly and drinking down a few mouthfuls of cold tea, he jerked his towel embroidered with a double-headed cock off its hook, picked up the plastic carrier bag holding his toiletries, and went out into the corridor. The last person in the toilet queue was a bearded Caucasian by the name of Abel - today for some reason his face didn't have its usual affable expression, and even the toothbrush protruding from his fist seemed like a short dagger.
<P>
"I'm behind you in line," said Andrei. "I'm just going for a smoke, okay?"
<P>
"Don't worry about it," Abel said gloomily.
<P>
When the heavy door with the deeply scratched graffito - "Locomotives are Champs" - and the filthy little window clicked behind him, he remembered he's run out of cigarettes the day before. Fortunately, just behind the door he saw a tumbler-gambler, sitting in the middle of a small group of people. He begged a "Mainline" from one of them and watched.
<P>
The tumbler-gambler was so old and wrinkled, he looked like a half-dead monkey, and an empty beer can for alms would have suited him far better than the three small plastic cups that he moved slowly around a piece of cardboard. Perhaps he was a guru and teacher - his large assistants were certainly very impressive and physically well-endowed: There were two of them, dressed in identical reddish-coloured jackets made by Chinese political prisoners from poor quality leather. They argued all too convincingly with each other, pushed each other in the chest and took turns at winning new 50,000 ruble notes from the tumbler-gambler, who handed them over without saying a word or even looking up.
<P>
Andrei moved away and leaned against the wall by the window. The radio had guessed right - it really was a sunny day. As the tumbler-gambler raised his head and his bald patch gleamed in the slanting yellow rays, for a moment his remaining tufts of grey hair were transformed into a glowing halo, and the complex passes he made above the sheet of cardboard seemed like a ritual from some forgotten religion.
<P>
"Hey!" said one of his assistants, raising his head. "What's with all the smoke? There's no air left in here as it is/"
<P>
Andrei didn't answer.
<P>
"You deaf?" asked the assistant, drawing himself up to his full height.
<P>
Again Andrei said nothing. Whichever way you look at it, the assistant was in the wrong - it wasn't his territory.
<P>
"I turn and spin, I want to win," the tumbler-gambler suddenly wheezed.
<P>
This was obviously a codeword, and the assistant got the message. he tossed his head and went back to arguing with his partner. Andrei took a last drag and threw the butt at their feet.

<H3>from MEMORY WAX by Alan Singer</H3>

<i>Memory Wax</i> is a novel from <A HREF="singer.html#fiction">Fiction Collective 2</A>. Alan Singer is the author of two previous novels, <i>The Ox-Breadth
</i>(1980) and<i>The Charnel Imp </i> (1988). He also has written two
works of literary criticism, <i>A Metaphorics of Fiction </i>and <i>The
Subject as Action. </i>He directs the Graduate Creative Writing program
at Temple University.

What was there then in the wax that was so distinctly comprehended?

<P>
They did not lead Delta Tells in manacles to an iron cell where she could
kneel beneath barred shadows and, under the harder gaze of a judge, press
out a confession from her heart.
<P>
She had made a mad disarray of her hair, the better to hide the deputies
from their fears when they looked at her, she thought. Crossed behind her
back, her hands thrust out for the turnkey's rough grasp, she was already
walking to the door. She was already nodding her head toward the swaying
noose to show them that she would present no obstacle to her fate. If she
could have removed the steps from her feet before she took them, so she
would have shortened her path to the scaffold.
<P>
But no magistrate arrived with a formal clanking of chains. And those
wary neighbors who had gathered to the sound of Delta's pealing voice
would not take her into custody. The three neighborly wives who stayed to
hear Delta's story the second time through, sat calmly about her kitchen
table, though it was within clear reach of the sharply serrated knife,
the brightly pronged fork, the skillet that would ring with the weight of
a sledgehammer, all still waiting to be washed. Sitting amid the crusted
mixing bowls and freshly drained cutting boards, all the stained utensils
that littered the cook's frantic circuit between the stove and the
serving board, they listened to her confession and did not squirm.
<P>
They heard how she had grappled with the meal.
<P>
She said: at first she did not know how to hold the wriggling body
against its movements or which was the softest for the blood. What she
held with one hand moved with the force of her other working hand, where
it thrust only to strike bone or miss, chipping the enamel backsplash of
the counter until she could not tell the movements of her hands from the
life they gripped. So she made the knife move faster, slicker. Finally
she knew that there was more movement in her self than she held in her
hands and her hands were full of the spouting rubbery gouts, fatting her
fingers, sticking to her palms, splashing the counter. The bowl was
foaming to its rim of blood. Though she could not tell one piece from
another, she advised herself that everything could be used in a stew.
<P>
The pot was big enough and she could cover it before the fouler smells
boiled up into her nostrils, fingers of steam forcing her head back so
that she couldn't see what she was about. She might have spilled.
<P>
The fire sputtered under the bubbling pot. The lid was unsteady but kept
a steady, steamy pressure against her watchful eye. Everything, even the
bones, like a shattered nest at the bottom of the pot, could be heard to simmer.
<P>
Finally, the escaping steam filled her eyes. It filled the room. When she
moved, she became part of the expansion. No thoughts could enter such a
diaphanous mind. Her only attachment to the world that stained her
fingertips was the acid stink of a few singed hairs which pinched her
nose and by that grip plucked her out of the sky of oblivion.
<P>
How had she set the table? The ring of bone china against the knottypine
tolled in her ears still. Only one setting: the napkin rolled in its
wicker holder; the two-tined fork; the toothy knife; the chair pulled
out; each item of the setting mottled with the moist fingerprints of her
tense attention to detail, though none of it had left any imprint on her
mind. When she saw the table set, she widened her eyes as if she had just
turned on her pillow toward the breaking light.
<P>
"It is a feast for a king," she told Brainard Tells, when she set the
heavy iron pot before her husband's plate. And because he ate regally,
with his back straight, his head high, though he was dipping into the
very bottom of the pot, he must have believed that it was true.
<P>
When he was finished she saw that he had had no need of the napkin. He
had licked himself clean. His lips glistened with satisfaction. She
waited for the unwelcome smile to gnaw its way through the plumped mouth.
<P>
Then she spoke.
<P>
"Shall I be the regurgitation of the meal you cannot stomach, husband of
my life?
<P>
"Once the servant of your banquet, let me now be the ticklish feather at
the bottom of your clenched throat. If, when you are gathered into the
arms of strenuous convulsions, you do not feel the violet heat of my
embrace, then I have failed my sacred vow.
<P>
"Or can I draw the tide of your sickness with the lunacy of your good
faith in me, knowing, as I do that my words, empty footprints of my
deeds, will soon be watered with your tears? They will leave a bright
trail that is also the reflection of your downcast eye, wet as glass,
malleable as wax.
<P>
"Rather, let me pick your teeth of the crime.
<P>
"I scratch a scent off your breath. I breathe it back to you. It is as
thick as brushed hair. I scrape a fingernail off your tongue. For you, it
is the bubble that has burst and left its effervescent tingle at the back
of your throat. A fleck of blue iris sticks in the corner of your mouth
like your own saliva. I hear the ache of your cracked tooth, the bone
that is already crushed against your palate.
<P>
"Open your mouth to the fullest and I will name the colors painted with
your appetite: pink of the fingertip poking your expanded waist. White of
the eye in which your fright is congealed like a single roe from the
chilly plate. Pale flush of the nose that is thrust against your larynx
where you catch your breath. Yellow of the hairs that are stretched the
unswallowable length of your throat. Pulling towards darkness, they are
tuned against your feeble cough. These undying notes of sadness you have
plucked with your own greedy fingers.
<P>
"Pink, white, pale flush, yellow and, finally, red of the bellowing mouth
that shivers your esophagus with the sound of the baby's last tantrum. If
you could open your livid mouth any wider, the whole shape of the infant
head might disgorge with eyes, nose, hair, mouth, all the perfect
likenesses of your sated self, so that you could see what you have done.
<P>
"You have eaten your own."

<H2>Fiction Collective 2</H2>

<H3>Straight Outta Normal</H3>

<b> by Michael Berube</b>
<P>
 Once upon a time in the shadows of Brooklyn College, four avant-garde
writers--Jonathan Baumbach, Steve Katz, Peter Spielberg, and Mark
Mirsky--got together and decided to shake things up. It was 1974, just a
year after Richard Kostelanetz's The End of Intelligent Writing  had
excoriated practically the entire publishing industry as a closed
corporation of logrolling thinkalikes: the fallout from the 1960s was
still in the air, New York was still the place for struggling artists to
be, and though the Time-Warner media mergerfest was another decade away,
large publishing houses were already closing their doors to a great deal
of weird and challenging writers. So Baumbach, Katz, Spielberg and Mirsky
formed the Fiction Collective, whereby they would publish their own stuff
as well as that of any like-minded experimentalist who looked good. Each
member of the Collective would have one vote concerning the acceptance of
manuscripts, and individual authors would have complete control over the
editing, design and marketing of their works.
<P>
Through the 1970s the Collective did indeed thrive, turning out wave upon
wave of innovative, exciting fiction, garnering critical acclaim not only
from variously avant folks like Robert Coover and Jerome Klinkowitz but
also, on occasion, from Newsweek  and The New York Times  to boot.
Raymond Federrnan's Take It or Leave It,  Ronald Sukenick's Long Talking
Bad Conditions Blues, Baumbach's Chez Charlotte  and Emily,  Spielberg's
Crash Landing,  Clarence Major's Reflex and Bone Structure  and Fanny
Howe's In the Middle of Nowhere, were all Fiction Collective books, and
all helped establish FC's reputation in the publishing world, in the
academy, and among "serious" writers and readers. Fiction Collective
writers found champions like Rachel Blau du Plessis, Toni Morrison, and
Morris Dickstein, and the original FC group itself was unified enough to
appear as a "school," with an identifiable brand name and trademark:
whether it was called "surfiction" (Federman) or "post-contemporary"
(Klinkowitz), FC fiction was distinguished by its bad attitude toward
reportage, its narrative reflexivity, its typographical oddities, its
penchant for addressing readers directly--you know, its general
preference for ludicity over lucidity.
<P>
But the Collective got rather unwieldy in the mid-'80s, partly because of
the ever-swelling size of its membership (now numbering over sixty) and
partly because of collective inertia (though I suppose that depends on
whom you ask). By 1987, FC was down to publishing only one or two books a
year from the five-six a year of the 1970s. FC2 was therefore born from
FC's ashes in 1988, and is run by the leaders of the "coup," Ron Sukenick
(at Colorado) and Curtis White (at Illinois State, Normal) Like many
other alternative presses, FC2 now publishes a very healthy ten to twelve
hooks a year, including the Black Ice series and a series begun in 1991,
On the Edge: New Womens Fiction. Each year FC2 also publishes the winner
of its national fiction competition, as well as the annual Charles H. and
N. Mildred Nilon Excellence in Minority Fiction Award (given to Ricardo
Cortez Cruz in 1992 and Omar S. Castaneda in 1993). The current
Collective writers no longer comprise an identifiable school, but what
FC2 has lost in brand-name clarity it has gained in heterogeneity and vitality.
<P>
Yet although FC2's brand of experimental fiction is, by and large, every
bit as good as experimental fiction ever was (say, since Tristram
Shandy), and the rejuvenation of FC2 is an extraordinarily bright sign
for dissidents, punks, and strange writers everywhere, it's so far been
much less visible to the literati than was its earlier incarnation,
thanks to the fact that the mainstream trade-press reviewing apparatus
has shriveled drastically in the past fifteen years. If Kostelanetz
thought it was hard for a marginal writer to get a notice from the Times
Book Review  in the late 1960s, he must know by now that it's nearly
impossible: nonprofit publishers get even less space from generalist
reviews than does contemporary literary theory, which means you probably
won't find Newsweek  or the New Republic t rumpeting any FC2 titles in
the near future. But like contemporary theory, FC2 work is finding more
responsive (and responsible) audiences in the pages of the alternative
press from the Village Voice  and The San Diego Reader  to the more
"specialized" readerships of Science Fiction Eye  and Maximum Rock'n'Roll
 (the nation's largest and longest-lived review of punk and post-punk
culture). And the market for FC2 books, though considerably less
"academic" than the market for theory, is roughly the same size: new
books usually appear in runs of two or three thousand, which means that
FC2 work is very likely competing for some of the same .001% of the
American public that buys the work of those jargon addled theoreticians
and talented small-press poets and fiction writers no one's ever heard
of. If there tends to be a good deal of hostility, suspicion, and mutual
indifference circulating among the avant FC2 crowd, the theory-laden MLA
crowd, and the trad-fiction MFA crowd (and the volume of anti-academic
rhetoric among trad and nontrad writers is but one index of this), that's
not only because their intellectual enterprises are often at odds it's
also because they're all fighting for the same small subculture of
active, inteilectually engaged readers--whether in the pages of the TBR,
the AWP Chronicle,  or Maximum Rockn'Roll.
<P>
As Sukenick has it, the transition from FC to FC2 is not so much a change
in style or cultural location as change in the Collective's approach
toward the idea of a "popular" audience whereas FC, like New Directions,
tried to exist against or despite the mass market, FC2 is actually trying
to break into the mass market. Sukenick's analogy--and you can find this
in the promotional material for Black Ice--is "the recent explosion in
the alternative music scene." For people like me who prefer the loopy wit
of the Lemonheads' Evan Dando to the brooding narcissism of Pearl Jam's
Eddie Vedder, it's not clear which alternative music scene is being
invoked here. All the same, FC2's relation to alt-pop and alt-mass does
indeed signal an important culrural shift in independent publishing.
Small quality presses like New Directions were defined by the
romantic-modernist dream of preserving Great Books from the detritus of
mass culture and the corruptions of the marketplace; the original Fiction
Collective, too, participated in that dream, trying to creare a small
enclave in which "the market" would have no force over the production of
new literature. FC2, by contrast, characteristically tries to exploit the
logic of the market (with its new series, its streamlined structure, and
its wider distribution), and bore into the mass from within. This
strategy suits its younger Avant-Pop writers just fine, since it employs
the strategies pursued by their own writing. What's odd about this
configuration, though, is that it leaves us with an "avant-guard" that
doesn't actually take up the "pure" cultural position of an intellectual
vanguard. If you're sympathetic to Andreas Huyssen's cogent account of
postmodernism as a "post-avantgarde" culture, then, the distinctive thing
about FC2 is that its texts and readers are as likely to show up on
Internet or post-punk fanzines as in small cafes, disseminated as
circuitously and as unpredictably through the culture as is postmodernism
itself.
<P>
There is no single thread running through the recent work published by
FC2; on the whole, this work is generally more shocking, more difficult,
or more iconoclastic than your average offering from Knopf or Morrow but
it's impossible to chart FC2's cultural location in the pseudo-military
terms of avant and garde. Nor is it possible to predict where you'll hear
of this work next: it was, for instance, the lunatic
multiple-streams-of-consciousness of Richard Grossman's The Alphabet Man
(1993), that got a friendly notice from Details magazine, the high-gloss
bible of fashionable twentysomethings, and Ricardo Cortez Cruz's hip
hip-hop hype, Straight Outta Compton  (1993), that got props from The
Nation,  the no-gloss paper of record for unfashionable lefties.
<P>
But I can predict one thing safely: ten or twenty years from now,
Alphabet Man  and Straight Outta Compton  will still be around. As large
houses cut more and more unprofitable mid-list writers from their rolls,
FC2 may pick up more writers like Cris Mazza and Kemleth Bernard, whose
writing, in a less profit-driven fiction market, would certainly be
accessible enough for a few of the smaller conglomerates. And FC2 will
always be the place for utterly unmarketable or extremely abrasive work,
such as Samuel Delany's Hogg (1995) which is reputed to make the
grisliest scenes from Naked Lunch  look like teatime with Jane Austen.
Yet one truly crucial thing about FC2's publishing enterprise is usually
overlooked: like many alternative presses and academic publishers, the
Collective does not take works out of print if they're not "selling."
Three-hundred copies left in the warehouse? Fifteen sales last year?
Doesn't matter, the book stays available. And as a result, you can still
get your hands on Clarence Major's and Peter Spielberg's novels from the
l970s even though the contemporary work of less experimental writers is
no longer for sale. What's more, FC2's backlist will likely remain of
greater interest than will that of most university presses: it may not
matter much to the world if a 20-year-old study of nature imagery in
Faulkner remains somewhere in the remnant bin for only $3.00, but it's
important that Reflex  and Bone Structure  is still at your fingertips,
just as it will be important in 2020 to be able to get The Alphabet Man,
Bayard Johnson's Damned Right, or Lou Robinson's Napoleons Mare  simply
by filling out an order form.
<P>
FC2 performs the critical task of sustaining this nation's weirder
literary heritages against the logic of Time-Warner and the Sears
Financial Network, which will foster "novelty" only so long as it is
quickly succeeded by more "novelty." Among the many functions undertaken
by FC2 as a nonprofit "cutting edge" press, it is of signal and lasting
consequence that FC2 be a literally "conservative" force for the
preservation and transmission of avant-pops, neomods, and unclassifieds
everywhere.

<H2>coffee break with georgette</H2>
On a July afternoon nothing goes better than Mom's hot apple pie and coffee. 
But since Georgette was out spanning the web, we thought  we'd feature a recipe from George Jr. correspondent Sandy Andes. Her name not only sounds as sweet as the honeysuckle,  this hip Baby Boomer  from Ashtabula, Ohio, has a great recipe for a killer apple pie with streusel topping that would melt any guest. 
<P>
<B>Crust:</B>
<MENU>
<UL>
<LI>3 cups flour
<LI>1.5 cup Crisco (preferrably butter flavor)
<LI>1 tablespoon vinegar
<LI>5 tablespoons water
<LI>1 egg
</UL>
</MENU>
<P>
Mix flour and Crisco until well blended. Add water, vinegar, and egg. Blend until dough  has a nice dough-like consistency. (You have a problem with that definition? Please don't tell me you were expecting Betty Crocker here?)
For those seeking to save time, the above steps may be substituted for Ready Made crust. But if it doesn't taste like homemade, don't come crying to me.
<P>
<B>Filling:</B>
<MENU>
<UL>	
<LI>1 tablesppon of lemon juice
<LI>1/3 cup honey
<LI>1 teaspoon cinnamon
<LI>3 to 4 cups thinly sliced Granny Smith apples
<LI>1 tablespoon butter
</UL>

Heat lemon juice, cinnamin and honey in a saucepan. Place sliced apples in an unbaked crust. Pour honey mixture over and dab with butter.  Cover with aluminum foil and bake at 425 degrees for 50 minutes. Uncover after 30 minutes.

<P>
Mix by hand. (Wooden spoons just don't cut it here. You need the right consistency that only your digits can do.) Cover pie and bake at 350 for 10 minutes.
<P>
If you are really trying to impress, prepare the pie the night before your dinner.  Add your streusel topping and refrigerate overnight. The pie can finish cooking while you are eating dinner or brewing coffee.  Makes the kitchen smell great and you look damn good too.
<P>
I'd like to be able to suggest a corresponding coffee here, but I think Sandy's speciality of the day could work best. That's going to your local java house and experienting by blending three of your favorite coffees together. The results can be quite pleasing to the palate. But remember, common sense applies.  A chocolate and hazelnut go, but a bitter Euthopian blend would probably not fit in this mix.
<P>
Bon appetite!

<H3>"Statement Regarding the Telecommunications Reform Bill"</H3>
<H3>"Its Effect on Electronic Book Publishing"</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>

In February, President Clinton signed into law the Telecommunications Reform Act.
Included in this legislation is a very controversial and dangerous provision,
the so-called "Communications Decency Act or Amendment" (CDA).
<P>
The ACLU, along with several other civil rights and net advocacy groups, such
as EFF and EPIC, and joined by several businesses, are all plaintiffs in a
lawsuit just filed in Federal court to rule the CDA unconstitutional.  The CDA
is clearly an egregious assault on our Constitutional rights and deserves to
be overturned.
<P>
The ramifications of the CDA to civil liberties and rights are complex and
wide-ranging.  It is not the intent of this statement to outline all of these
complexities and ramifications as they are many, and is being done by others.
Rather, we will primarily focus on the effect of the CDA to electronic book
publishing here in the U.S., particularly with regard to direct marketing of
titles over the Internet.  However, before doing so, it is necessary to give
a short summary background about the CDA itself so its probable impact on
electronic book publishing will be easier to see.
<P>
In essence, the CDA makes it a felony, punishable by up to two years in prison
and a hefty fine, to either access or to disseminate, on any public electronic
network, material which is determined to be "indecent", and that "indecent" is
defined by "contemporary community standards."
<P>
Not only is "indecent" still legally vague, the few court rulings define it as
being much broader than "obscene" and includes speech which the courts have
determined to be wholly protected in many other venues.
<P>
In addition, recent court rulings strongly imply that "contemporary community
standards" are defined at the local level.  For example, a literary work which
is acceptable in California may be considered indecent by some local community
elsewhere in the U.S.  This means, theoretically at least, a person in
California, or even outside the U.S., who violates the "decency" of some small
community in the U.S., by simply distributing some material on the global
Internet, which in his or her hometown would be considered acceptable, could
be extradited by that small community to face felony charges, and to be judged
by a jury from that community and not their own!
<P>
This small community could hold the rest of the United States and even the
world hostage to their over-broad view of what is "indecent."  Not only is it
grossly unfair to any rational thinker, it is dangerous to all of our civil
liberties as it gives too much power to any small organized fringe group,
including religious groups, to trample on the rights, practices, and desires
of the silent majority in mainstream America.
<P>
And, to make matters worse, the obsolete Comstock Act of 1873 was extended by
the CDA to include all electronic networks, making it a criminal act,
punishable by a 5 year prison term, to disseminate *any* information about
abortion on the Internet, even in private e-mail.  This, combined with the
vagueness of "indecency", would stifle any discussion on legitimate
contemporary topics such as abortion, birth control, AIDS prevention, GLB
issues, scholarly and health-related aspects of human sexuality, etc.
<P>
Under CDA, even some court rulings cannot be distributed over the Internet
since they contain one or more of the "seven words" which the "Pacifica" court
ruling determined were "indecent".  Thus, the "Pacifica" ruling itself is
banned from distribution on the Internet since it lists these "seven words"!
And let's not forget the "Roe vs. Wade" decision on abortion -- it, too,
cannot be legally distributed on the Internet, at least by the strictest
interpretation of the CDA.
<P>
Clearly the CDA is a gross violation to our First Amendment right of Free
Speech as well as our socially-accepted right for all citizens to be able to
access and obtain information, including court rulings, in the most convenient
way existing at the time.  Free exchange of information is one of the
cornerstones of democracy.
<P>
The effect of the CDA, should it prevail in the courts (which is fortunately
doubtful), would also be a major setback to the new and rapidly growing
electronic book industry here in the U.S.  It might also lead to the eventual
domination of publishing by Europe and Japan, though this is admittedly more
debatable.  Right now the U.S. enjoys a commanding dominance in publishing.
<P>
Clearly, in the absence of CDA or similar restrictions, the future of
electronic book publishing is very promising.  Already we are seeing
significant growth of the electronic book publishing industry;  OmniMedia is
one of several pioneering electronic book publishers, and new ones are coming
"online" every month.  Some of the major print publishers are beginning to
venture into this area as well.  As technology advances, particularly in high
resolution and inexpensive flat screen displays, it is only a matter of time,
some say in as little as 15 to 20 years, when more electronic books will be
sold worldwide than their bound paper counterparts.
<P>
In addition, the continual upgrading of our "Information Superhighway" to
higher and higher speed and capacity makes it not only possible, but also very
attractive (to both publisher and consumer alike) for electronic books to be
directly marketed to the consumer via the Internet.  This is already being
considered by the multi-billion dollar entertainment industry for the sale and
distribution of audio recordings and movies (note that the CDA puts a damper
on this.)  Any rational thinking person would see the immense value in this
means of distributing information and entertainment of all types.
<P>
OmniMedia and a few other publishers now distribute and sell e-books directly
over the Internet via the World Wide Web (WWW) and are finding it profitable
because it is very convenient for the consumer and significantly reduces the
overhead costs of production, marketing and distribution, which, with free-
market competition, the savings will pass on to the consumer.
<P>
It does not take a rocket scientist to realize that the CDA would ban the
electronic distribution of a large fraction of the books that are published
today (it would not be surprising if over half of all books would be deemed
"indecent" by the "seven words" criteria alone, not to mention the more
intangible and uncertain aspects of what else constitutes "indecency", and by
whom.)  Therefore, the CDA has a profound chilling effect on the use of the
Internet to distribute such material and, in practice, will not allow this
method of distribution to mature in the U.S., to the loss of both the consumer
and the publishing industry.
<P>
Instead, publishers will still have to rely on the traditional way to market
both paper and electronic books which is much more inefficient and expensive.
Ultimately, it is a major blow to consumers who, in a CDA-free world, would be
able to purchase e-books at lower cost than present-day paper books and who
would have the convenience of rapid delivery of any titles available on the
market right to their home.  It would also greatly benefit publishers in ways
that would take too long to discuss here.  The CDA is a damaging blow to
electronic book publishing here in the U.S.
<P>
(As an aside, in a similar manner, many mainstream magazines would also be
banned from Internet distribution.  The rapidly escalating cost of high-
quality "glossy" paper is making Internet distribution extremely attractive.
But of course the passage of the CDA puts a stop to this as it does electronic
book distribution over the Internet.)
<P>
One could argue that the U.S. publishers could suitably encrypt or password
protect their e-books allowing them to be distributed on the Internet and
bypass CDA restrictions.  But the current CDA is not so forgiving -- the CDA
makes no distinction in what form the information is distributed.  If the
content of any e-book is deemed to be "indecent" by some small community as
mentioned above, it makes no difference if it is encrypted or written in
Swahili, or even if it is distributed on an electronic network where only
adults are allowed access since the CDA covers *all* public electronic
networks, no matter how subscribership to the networks is configured (the CDA
does this, of course, to "protect our children", who must be so cunning as to
be able to break into any closed network and to decrypt messages even the NSA
could not decrypt.)
<P>
And all the while the U.S. publishing industry is restricted to marketing
books the "old-fashioned way", our European and Japanese friends will not be
so restricted.  They will enjoy the ability and advantages of marketing
directly over the Internet in their own countries and so will clearly dominate
there, as well as developing the infrastructure to do so, getting a large
technological jump over U.S. publishers.  How this will effect the current
supremacy the U.S. has in publishing is debatable, since it can be argued that
it is still a level playing field -- the U.S. publishers can market their
e-books over the Internet outside the U.S., and the rest of the world has to
market their e-books the "old-fashioned way" within U.S. borders.
<P>
But it is hard to imagine that the greater freedom and flexibility enjoyed by
the Europeans and Japanese, as well as getting a technological jump, will not
eventually translate into gaining market dominance and hurting the U.S.
publishing industry.  And they are formidable competitors:  the Japanese
domination in the U.S. market for consumer electronics and automobiles should
serve as a warning of what could happen in the publishing field if the CDA is
not overturned or significantly amended as soon as possible.
<P>
Our competitors are looking for any crack in U.S. resolve to fully compete
against us in the international marketplace, and the CDA is an obvious major
crack.  Billions of dollars and thousands of jobs are at stake here, and this
was not even considered when the ill-written CDA was silently slipped into the
Telecommunications Reform Act without any public input before Congress.
<P>
And let's not forget the U.S. consumer, who will also be hurt by the CDA
restrictions as pointed out above.
<P>
Thus, OmniMedia urges Congress to trash the CDA and pass sane and publicly
debated legislation, and not only because it would be good for U.S. business
and consumers, but because it is morally the right thing to do.
<P>
We support the right of parents to protect their children by providing parents
with the necessary software to block any Internet information that they don't
want their children to view.  This is easily done.  We do NOT support taking
away the parental right to determine what their children should and should not
view, nor do we support taking away the parent's own rights to Free Speech on
the Internet.
<P>
The current CDA does what the silent majority in America does not want:
allowing some faceless person in some far removed community to determine what
parents in mainstream America should and should not allow their children to
view -- it is government intrusion into the family at its worst.  It also
takes away the parents' own rights to Free Speech, holding them and the entire
U.S. public hostage to an insane piece of legislation, and to a small
minority, whose stated purposes for pushing the CDA was to "protect our
children" and to "stop child pornography" (what American doesn't support these
laudable goals?)  But the profound and chilling ramifications of the CDA go
light-years beyond these stated purposes and suggest that the *real* motives
of this small but dedicated minority were something that mainstream Americans
do not share, nor want.
<P>
One day "our children" will grow up and find themselves without Free Speech
protection as well as fewer jobs, all because of the "wisdom" of the CDA.
Without guaranteed Free Speech in all mediums, it will only be a matter of
time before we won't be able to protect our children, either.  Free Speech is
a cornerstone of democracy, and without it, our other rights, including the
Freedom of Religion, are in serious peril.  And when these rights are gone,
and the U.S. is a dictatorship, it will be *our children* who will be sent
to the Gulags.  I don't know about you, but I'd rather have my children see
the "seven words" over the Internet (which they hear all the time at school
anyway) than to see them live in a totalitarian or theocratical state.
<P>
The CDA is a bad piece of legislation that does not serve the public interest.
It does not add anything useful in the legitimate fight against child
pornography and online harassment using the Internet (another claimed reason
for its existence) -- the proven and Constitutionally tested laws we now have
on the books have been shown to be adequate to deal with the problem when law
enforcement is motivated to enforce them.  And as it should have been made
clear by now, the CDA is bad for business and very bad for U.S. economic
competitiveness in the world.

NOTE FROM: Peter Rodman
SUBJECT: Libya: Looking Ahead
  Now that we know of Libyan plans to attack U.S. interests in various
parts of the world (in addition to the public threats already made), we
face two predictable problems:
 -- We ought to make clear (if we haven't
    already) that we will hold Libya
    responsible for any such attacks
    on U.S. interests.
 -- Since such attacks are now predictable,
    do we have contingency plans for
    responding? Our ships will have
    left the area; how long will it take
    them to come back? (Or should we
    keep them there longer?) Are we
    prepared to retaliate against Libya
    if its responsibility for such acts
    is clear?
  The dispersal of our ships in the next few days will not be the end of
this.  I hope we will be prepared.

As you know, for years now the Miskitos have called me first---they just
got word to me that the Sandinistas have attacked innocent Miskito
civilians on the Rio Coco apparently trying to smoke out KISAN. These are
the Miskitos that they had put in the concentration camps ('82) &
recently resettled on the Rio Coco. Roger Herman says, through Adrianna
Guillen, that 3500 Miskito
refugees have gone into Honduras and need immediate humanitarian
assistance---food, shelter, etc. KISAN paramedics are trying to deal with
the wounded, fighting with KISAN did occur. Sandinistas may have taken
atleast 25 prisoners. Roger cannot reach the Red Cross because it is Holy
Week and no one is around. He requested that we contact UNHCR for
emergency assistance. I called Alan Friers and he is checking to confirm
the story.  I also reached Dick Holwill (the only DAS there at this hour)
to alert ARA's
front office that this attack against the Miskitos is in the process of
being confirmed by the Agency, and that they have requested our
assistance with the refugees.

NOTE FROM: JAMES R. STARK
SUBJECT: Libya next steps
I met today in Mike Armacost's office with reps from State (Raphel,
Oakley, Platt), CIA [Deleted, (b)(1)(c) exemption] Juchniewicz), and DOD
(Armitage, Moellering) to discuss next steps for Libya.  The most
immediate areas of concern are the cascading indications of Libyan
terrorist attack and the imminent departure of two of the three CVBGs
(Saratoga on April 2 and Coral Sea on April 10).  Additionally, DOD/JCS
unwillingness to forward any option other than the 4 military targets
already identified in Libya remains a problem.  Following
actions/decisions were made: --US forces will be on [Deleted, (b)(1)(c)
exemption] tether to conduct Prairie Fire strikes (menu of one or more of
the 4 approved targets) on Libya in response to terrorist attack.  Would
require new NSPG decision to implement.
 --Once CVBG level down to one, still have to meet the [Deleted,
(b)(1)(c) exemption] Prairie Fire requirement without relying on third
country permission to launch strikes, i.e., FB-111 from UK.
 --About 7 April, group will review whether this can be done with only
one CVBG in Med. (I think extending Sara or Coral Sea is a non-starter).
JCS option is to bring Enterprise from IO. But this takes longer than
[Deleted, (b)(1)(c) exemption] and may not get [Deleted, (b)(1)(c)] due
NPW issue.
 --State drafting cables for us to send to UK, France, Italy via
cabinet channels highlighting extensive indicators of Libyan
terrorist threat, our resolve to respond, and giving heads up
on possible request to stage through them.
 --DOD will send list of [Deleted,(b)(1)(s) exemption] targets referred
to by CJCS at 14 Mar NSPG.  They would not consider additional military
targets [One line and a half deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] or political
targets [One line and a half deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] due
possibility of collateral damage).
[One line deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] State afraid of terrorist attack
fol by airport closure which would prevent extraction of Amcits [Deleted,
(b)(1)(s) exemption]
  --The [One line and a half deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] I don't
believe it. [One line and a half deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption]
     I remain concerned at our inability to get expanded target options
out of DOD.  The four Prairie Fire targets are a limp-wrist response
which don't even put a dent in Libya's military capability.  If we have
to go in and take casualties, which we surely will, then we ought to make
it count for something.  I would like to discuss with you Friday.

SUBJECT: Libyan Terrorism
[One line and a half deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] that they are planning
to attack US Embassy -- presumably in Beirut--tonight. State has the
cable and is alerting Reggie Bartholomew.
   If a terrorist attack is mounted, either in Lebanon or any of the
other areas with hard evidence of Libyan invovement, we need to be ready
to order implementation of PRAIRIE FIRE.  As long as 3 CVBG are in the
Med. this won't be a problem, though I would recommend that at least 2 of
them stay on a [Deleted, (b)(1)(s)  exemption] for now.

These excerpts are from a National Security Archive Documents Disk, (C) 1995 The National Security Archive, of 260 substantive White House e-mail messages which could not fit in <i>White House E-mail </i>(New Press, $14.95) for space reasons.
<P><HR><P>



<a name=techies><H3>Techies/White House E-mail link</H3>

The White House refused to provide any of the e-mail in electronic
form. Rather, White House and other government staff printed out
the specific e-mail messages targetted by the National Security
Archive's Freedom of Information Act requests, then reviewed the
printouts for classified information and privacy issues before
releasing them in hard copy form.
<P>
Ian Stevenson then employed a Hewlett Packard ScanJet IIc/ADF
scanner, together with CAERE optical character recognition
software, to digitize the large stack of White House printouts
selected for this disk. The typographical errors, run-on
sentences, bad grammar, colloquial language and other questionable
matters found here are all exactly as they appear in the originals
-- nothing was corrected or bowdlerized for this disk. The layouts
are as close to the originals as humanly possible, including the
classification markings.

<a name=CHRONOLOGY><H3>White House E-mail  CHRONOLOGY</H3>
<B>1982</B> - The National Security Council (NSC) staff at the White House acquires a prototype electronic mail system, from IBM, called the Professional Office
System (PROFs).
<P>
<B>April 1985 </B>- The PROFs e-mail system becomes fully operational within the NSC,
including not only the full staff, but also home terminals for the National
Security Adviser, Robert "Bud" McFarlane, and his deputy, Admiral John M.
Poindexter.
<P>
<B>November 1986</B> - The remainder of the White House comes on line with
electronic mail, at first with the PROFs system, and later (by the end of the 1980s) through a variety of systems including VAX A-1 ("All in One"), and ccmail.
<P>
<B>November 22-25, 1986</B> - John Poindexter and Oliver North electronically shred
more than 5000 e-mail notes in the memory banks of their computer systems, as the
Iran-contra scandal breaks.
<P>
<B>November 28, 1986</B> - Career staff at the White House Communications Agency
order the November backup tapes of the e-mail system to be saved instead of recycled as usual. Subsequently, investigators from the FBI and the Tower Commission use
the backup takes to reconstruct the Iran-contra scandal.
<P>
 - The Tower Commission issues its report on Iran-contra,
reprinting hundreds of PROFs notes exchanged by McFarlane, Poindexter and
North.
<P>
<B>January 19, 1989</B> - On the last day of the Reagan presidency, the National
Security Archive files a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests
together with a lawsuit against President Ronald Reagan, to prevent the imminent
erasure of the White House electronic mail backup tapes. At 6:10 pm, on the eve
of George Bush's inauguration, U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker issues a
Temporary Restraining Order, prohibiting the destruction of the backup tapes to
the PROFs system.
<P>
<B>September 15, 1989</B> - U.S. District Judge Charles B. Richey rules that the
National Security Archive and its co-plaintiffs, including the American
Historical Association (AHA) and the American Library Association (ALA), have
standing to sue President Bush, in order to force him to comply with the
retention requirements of various records acts which potentially cover the White
House e-mail.
<P>
<B>January 25, 1991</B> - After a year-and-a-half of legal procedural wrangling, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upholds Judge Richey's
ruling on standing, denying the Bush administration's attempts to have the case
dismissed.
<P>
<B>November 20, 1992</B> - On request from the plaintiffs, Judge Richey adds the White House e-mail from the lame-duck Bush administration to the case, issuing a
restraining order preventing the Bush White House from destroying its own
backup computer records.
<P>
<B>January 6, 1993</B> - Judge Richey rules that computer tapes containing copies of
e-mail messages by Reagan and Bush White House staff must be preserved like
other government records, because the electronic versions are not simply duplicates of
paper printouts, but contain additional information beyond the paper copies.
<P>
<B>January 11 and 14, 1993</B> - Judge Richey issues specific court orders requiring
that the Bush White House preserve its computer records. In press interviews,
Judge Richey says that despite his orders, he believes that the Bush
administration is planning to destroy its e-mail files.
<P>
<B>January 15, 1993</B> - In an expedited emergency ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit upholds and modifies the rulings by Judge
Richey, holding that government officials could erase White House and NSC
computer files, as long as they preserved, on backup tapes, identical copies of
what was being erased.
<P>
<B>January 19, 1993</B> - President Bush signs a secret agreement with Don Wilson,
head of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), purporting to
grant Bush exclusive legal control over the e-mail tapes of his administration. 
Working through the night, a staff team from NARA takes custody of thousands
of tapes and disk drives, hurriedly removing them from White House offices to
prevent incoming Clinton appointees from gaining access to them.
<P>
<B>February 16, 1993</B> - NARA career staff who managed the transfer describe in an internal memo how the so-called "midnight ride" had violated NARA's own rules
for records transfers and how several sets of tapes ordered preserved by Judge Richey
had been lost, erased or damaged.
<P>
<B>May 22, 1993 </B>- Judge Richey cites the Clinton White House and the acting
Archivist of the United States for contempt of court for failing to carry out his
order to issue new and appropriate guidelines for the preservation of the
computer records of the Reagan, Bush and Clinton White House staff.
<P>
<B>August 13, 1993</B> - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
vacates Judge Richey's contempt orders but upholds his overall decision that the
Federal Records Act (FRA) requires that complete electronic copies of e-mail
messages be preserved by the White House, and by extension, government
agencies in general. The appeals court remands the case to Judge Richey to decide the
issue of the dividing line between "agency" records covered by the FRA and
presidential records covered by the Presidential Records Act.
<P>
<B>March 25, 1994</B> - In a brief filed in federal court, the Clinton administration
declares that the National Security Council is not an agency, and should be
accorded the protection from public scrutiny given to the President's personal
advisers. This argument attempts to remove the Clinton administration's White
House e-mail from the reach of FOIA requests and the FRA, arguing that all its
documents are subject only to the Presidential Records Act (PRA) and therefore
not to court oversight.
<P>
<B>December 13, 1994</B> - The e-mail plaintiffs file suit against the Acting Archivist
of the United States to void the Bush-Wilson agreement, in American Historical
Association et. al. v. Peterson.
<P>
<B>February 15, 1995</B> - Judge Richey rejects the Clinton administration's arguments about the NSC's status as "arbitrary and capricious... contrary to history, past practice and the law," and declares that the National Security Council is an
agency. The government subsequently appeals the decision, and the plaintiffs
cross-appeal against a portion of Richey's ruling that opens a loophole for
senior NSC staff giving advice to the President.
<P>
<B>February 27, 1995</B> - In a separate opinion in the lawsuit over the Bush-Wilson
agreement, Judge Richey declares the agreement "null and void," writing that "No
one, not even a President, is above the law." The New York Times subsequently
editorializes, under the headline "A Special Place in History for Mr. Bush," that
"No President has the right to corner official records in an effort to control
his place in history." (March 1, 1995, page A18)
<P>
<B>September 8, 1995</B> - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit hears oral arguments in the case on the issue of Judge Richey's decision
and the agency versus Presidential status of the NSC.

I'd have to vote for Bill Clinton because in my opinion nobody else is running.  I'd think seriously about Colin Powell because of his strong military background since we willalways be involved in somebody's war.  I'm curious to see if the country is ready to accept a black man.  Doyle is not only too old he has not learned anything from life.  Pat Buchanan is a dangerous man and should be locked up.  Steve Forbes is too rich and I can't see any way he has helped the poor (who are always with us).  Clinton is not too religious, too rich, too old or may I add too smart, but he's learning from his mistakes. </menu>

OK then I am going to go into the showbiz category and pick Regis Philben. Now don't laugh, I have some pretty good reasos for this.  One, he shows every morning that he knows a lot about what's going on in this country.  Plus he is a real person, by that I mean what you see is what you get.  He lives like a regular person, and I can actually say that i have met him before so I can vouch for that.  Another good thing is that he isn't a politician, so even though he has money, he lives like a regular person.  He takes a cab to work, he is a sports fan, and he has morals! </menu>

I would stick with Clinton because he's a known commodity whereas Dole is a known comedy.  There is some concern regarding Clinton's waffling on the issues but I'm not sure Dole is any better.  Clinton's waffling is due in part to the learning curve associated with dealing with the Washington insiders.  Dole has been an insider for 20 years.  He is a major reason we're in the shape we're in right now.  He offers us nothing but four more years like the past 20 and I'm not willing to regress right now.  Also, I'm not interested in candidates who are from Dole's generation.  The world has changed and change is picking up speed at a dizzying pace.  The information age is still in its infancy and I don't think we need another president who doesn't know his RAM from his Bytes. </menu>

I have parked in front of the computer keyboard for much too long, sifting through a list of possible candidates. Bill Clinton has been a major disappointment, so I'd not want him for another four years. Bob Dole would be a disaster; he suffers from the same disease as Clinton, a severe shortage of
backbone. My ingrained Democratic leanings wouldn't permit me to vote for the GOP anyway.  Damn. Is there anyone capable of handling such a job? Probably not. All right, all right. I have to make a selection. Uhhhh, OK, I've got it. <BR>
GEORGE CLOONEY. He's accustomed to making quick decisions, so he'd be handy in a foreign policy crisis. He's good looking, intelligent, amusing, and I know his Aunt Rosemary, as well as his mom Nina and his dad Nick..  Go, George, Go! (Sounds better than Go, Pat, Go!, doesn't it?)</menu>

George Burns for President, Only thing, he is not around any longer, except his soul, which lingers strong and true on my shoulder. He was so wise. So happy. So feisty, smoking those stupid old cigars when everyone knows they kill you, early in life. He loved his wife, and said nice things about her. He seemed to really love our country. He was full of common sense, always able to make Gracey's gibberish
understandable. George would have been a good president. I would have voted
for him. As for the others running, I would like to have the opportunity to vote against them. Some countries let you do that, you know. They let you cast a NO vote for those running so that it can be heard loud and clear who the people DO NOT want in office. So, anyhow, that's all I have to say on
that matter. 
<P>
Oh, William Buckley....I wouldn't mind him for Pres, either. Not that more than a handful of folks in the country would ever know what he was saying.  But that man has a mind like a steal trap. I love the way his mind works.  Love his intelligence. Love his cool manner of dealing with people who don't
know a lick, but think they do. I would vote for William. But he's too wise to get into the down and dirty act of running for office. He knows that some dumb fool would try to make him straighten his tie and sit up straight and talk "straight" talk. Darn it. Wish he'd just jump in and run. I'd vote for
him. So, once again, I think that's all I have to say on the matter. But who knows, I may be back. </menu>

Of the current contenders, the answer is easy: Bill Clinton. I believe he has
done an admirable job under difficult circumstances.  He may not have managed
all his initiatives well, but his heart has always been in the right place.  I
don't believe the Republicans as a group--and Dole who is apparently a
shoe-in--has sufficient compassion for the poor.
<P>
 That said, I don't believe anyone has the moxie to do what's necessary to solve
this country's major problems.  I want a candidate willing to put a $1 gallon
tax on gasoline (introduced perhaps 20c ata time every six months).  That does a
lot of things.
<P>
<menu><nl>
<li>It will raise staggering amounts of cash that will balance the budget \not on
th ebacks of th epoor but on the backs of those who drive (and pollute) the
most.
<li>It will probably help our balance of payments problem, since presumably
people will drive less and reduce the demand for gasoline reducing the amount we
import.
<li>It will probably force people out of the trucks they've been buying (including Jeeps and Explorers and Caravans) into more economical vehicals and into mass transit.  This improves npot only our financial problems, but environmental ones as well.
<li>It will force american auto manufacturers to concentrate on developing and
marketing smaller cars.
<li>While there will certainly be some inflationary aspect to this, that will
presumably offset by animproved american economy (because of balanced budget)
creating more jobs, gasoline prices going down because of reduced consumption
and the gradual introduction of the tax.

I've probably told you more than you want to know.  And I haven't even discussed
my environmental or crime fighting packages.  Sadly I was not born in this

<H2>coffee break, 2nd cup</H2>
<P>
It's mid-summer. What a better way to prepare for the dog days of August than by whipping up Dirt Pudding - a light summery dessert to put a smile on your face (and add  infinitesmal additions to the love handles at your sides. ) This totally non-caloric dessert (not) is great with a chocolate cappucino, but any flavor cappucino will do.
<P>
Dirt pudding:
<MENU>
<UL>
<LI>1 large package of Oreo cookies
<LI>1 8oz. package of cream cheese
<LI>1/2 stick butter
<LI>3 cups of mik
<LI>1 teaspoon vanilla
<LI>2 packages instant vanilla pudding
<LI>1-16oz. cartoon of Cool Whip
<LI>1 cup powdered sugar
</UL>
</MENU>
<P>
Blend milk and packages of instant vanilla pudding. Refrigerate for 10-15 minutes. Blend together cream cheese, butter, and powdered suger. Mix vanilla and pudding mixture. Fold in Cool Whip.
<P>
In a large bowl place 1/2 of the mixture. Top with 1/2 bag of crushed Oreos. Cover with remainder of mixture. Top with the remainder of cookies.
<P>
If you are trying to watch your weight, you can subsitute each of items with its reduced fat version. For example, Oreos now come in reduced fat, as does the cream cheese, butter,  and Cool Whip. Go further and use skim or 1 percent milk instead of whole milk and you'll really have a a dessert that you don't have to feel guilty about. The nice part is though you can barely tell the difference between the low-fat and regular recipe.
<P>
Enjoy.

<H2>weights & measures</H2>
This month, the weighty take their measure of humankind  as the <i>fin de siecle  </i> waits at the top of the stairs:
<P>
"Sustainability without development, or subsistence, is simply leaving 
within the limits of genuinely basic needs. Shelter, food, education, 
community, and personal intimacy can all be met within this framework ... 
To face the future freely, one must give up both optimism and pessimism 
and place all hope in human beings.
<I>- Ivan Illich, philosopher</I>
<P>
"If state, party and social policy will not be based on morality, then 
mankind has no future to speak of. The converse is also true: If the 
politics of a state or the conduct of an individual is guided by a moral 
compass, this turns out to be not only the most humane, but in the long 
run the most prudent behavior for one's own future."
<I>- Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, author</I>
<P>
"A world in which a large part of the population is condemned to be 
excluded - cast in the darkness because they are poor - can never be 
secure. For the world to be at peace, we will need the rim of light to be 
extended."
<I>- Nelson Mandela, president of South Africa</I>
<P>
"Features of Third World society are penetrating American life. Third 
World influences - dynamic disorganization, easygoing attitudes, a slower 
pace of life, a different measurement of time, and relations to family - 
are altering the once-dominant northern European ways of putting society 
together. The sphere of neat, well-organized white society is shrinking  
... Plurality is the defining feature of the new civilization ... Every 
system that does not accept plurality as the new way of life is exploding."
<I>- Ryzsard Kapuscinski, author</I>

Everybody knows something about nothing, and nothing about something - but who can help out with the really important stuff? Kitty, of course. Just Ask Kitty (email address: <A HREF="mailto:askkitty@aol.com">askkitty@aol.com</A>).
<BR>

<I><font size=+3>q:</font> What is desire?</I><BR>
<font size=+3>a:</font> Desire is the fierce little growl of your soul, that tiny feral beast, when it needs to be fed.  The object of one's desire is what the soul needs to fill the chasm between it and perfection, or bliss.
<P>
In the Sufic tradition, God is the beloved, the object of desire, of both humans and angels.  According to the tradition, Lucifer was God's archangel.  When he refused to acknowledge the preeminence of Man, God's new creation, because he knew that this new lover would compete for God's attention, Lucifer was cast out of heaven, longing for God forever, and never again able to hear God's voice.
Bummer.
<P>
<I><font size=+3>q:</font> How do you figure out a tip?  And why do you tip more in New York City restaurants than you do in Little Rock, AK?</I><BR>
<font size=+3>a:</font> Tipping is an implied bargaining tool by which a diner rewards or punishes a dining establishment for the quality of experience enjoyed (or endured) therein.
<P>
Or so it would seem.  
<P>
Actually, tipping is a way for employers to get away with underpaying a wait staff, and thereby keep prices down and profits high.  Why not simply add 15% to the price of a meal and pass the extra on to the staff?  Go figure that one out for yourself.
<P>
As for percentage tipping, get real.  Does it really take less effort to serve coffee than a single malt scotch?  Of course not.  So why "give" the server less of a tip for a meal at a diner than you would at a four-star restaurant?  And am I getting off to a bad start with the server if I order the grilled chicken and a soda rather than the filet and a martini?  
<P>
It's too much to bear.  
<P>
If you must tip by percent, tip AT LEAST 15% unless you actually saw the server spit in your tortellini.  And be sure to tip according to how much time and effort you are asking of a server.  Thirty free refills on your $1.25 bottomless cup o' joe don't translate to an $.1875 tip, hon'.
<P>
And if all these moralizing tips don't get to you,  remember:  Beware of tip karma.
<P>
<I><font size=+3>q:</font> Who or what or where is God?</I><BR>
<font size=+3>a:</font> I was watching Nick Parks's remarkable Wallace and Gromit claymation movies the other day, wondering, "How the H--- did he DO that?"  I mean it all looks so seamless and "real," and you KNOW he shot each frame separately, taking into account how different materials move, look under certain light, and a million other things I can't even imagine.  And all the while, he paid great attention to achieving superb comic timing and maintaining a story.  
<P>
I thought about this for a while, and it just blew my mind.  Then I decided just to sit back and enjoy the movie.
<P>
<I><font size=+3>q:</font> My co-workers are always taking smoking breaks at work.  I don't smoke.  Should I feel guilty about taking breaks just to drink a cup of coffee or talk to a colleague?</I><BR>
<font size=+3>a:</font> I know what you mean.  I work with people who are constantly hanging around outside getting a fix of nicotine while enjoying the relaxed company of their colleagues, not to mention the weather.
<P>
Why should they have all the fun?  
<P>
Why should we reward people for having an addiction to a deadly drug?  Why can't I simply go out and sit in a sunbeam, or take a little snooze, or chat idly with my friends for five minutes without people thinking I'm "goofing off?"
<P>
Here's my solution: vice breaks.  
<P>
Give everyone the same number of little breaks to use however they choose.  A free pass for five minutes here, five minutes there, what's the big deal?  Everyone would be happier and more productive, and the work world would be a better place. 
<P>
<I><font size=+3>q:</font> If someone schedules me for lunch two weeks hence, is that a sign that we really shouldn't be wasting each other's time?</I><BR>
<font size=+3>a:</font> Maybe your friends are avoiding you because you use pretentious words like "hence."  Do you invite them to meet you at "yonder bistro wherein one finds an exquisite kitchen, whence cometh all manner of divine comestibles such as nary a gourmand can resist?"  And afterwards do you suggest that you "retire to a contiguous purveyor of fine spirits and engage in a rowdy comus"?
<P>
You rogue.
<P>
Just between you and me, gentle reader, give your friend a couple of chances, allowing for busy spells, grumpy periods, and the like, then forget it.  Friends make time for friends.  As one of my personal favs, Marcus Aurelius put it:
"Never let the excuse of duty keep you from having lunch with your friends,"  or something to that effect.

<H2>coffee break, 3rd cup</H2>
Aye, it's time my fair-weather, web-spanning cooks to try your hand at a real dessert.  Yes, it's time to create a cheesecake. These delicacies may appear intimidating but are remarkably easy to make.
<P>
To tease you with a taste of summer,  I thought I'd feature a raspberry chessecake.
<P>
Raspberry Cheesecake:
<MENU>
<UL>	
<LI>1 cup of crushed graham crackers
<LI>1/4 cup chopped almonds
<LI>3/4 cup sugar
<LI>4 tablespoons flour
<LI>2 tablespoons butter - melted
<LI>3-8oz. bars of cream cheese
<LI>1/4 cup raspberry liqueur
<LI>1 tablesppon vanilla
<LI>2 eggs
<LI>2-8oz. containers of raspberry yogurt
 </UL>
</MENU>
<P>
Mix graham cracker crumbs, almonds, 1/4 cup sugar, 2 tablesppons flour and butter. Press into a 9-inch springform pan.
<P>
Blend 1/2 cup sugar, remaining flour, cream cheese, liqueur and vanilla. ( If you can't find any raspberry liqueur  substitute raspberry syrup, which can be found in any respectable grocery store) Beat until fluffy. Add eggs, yogurt until well combined. (But never overbeat eggs in any cheesecake. That can cause your cheesebake to crack.)
<P>
Pour into pan. Bake at 375 degrees for 50 to 55 minutes or until  center appears set. Cool for 15 minutes. Loosen sides of springform pan with a knife and remove. Cool for 30 minutes. Refrigerate uncovered overnight.  (Cheesecakes should always be chilled overnight to let the flavor soak in.)
<P>
Top with fresh raspberries and sprinkle with powdered sugar.

<H3><b>Little woman's 'Inheritance' found</b></H3>
Cosgrove/Meurer Productions and Alliance Communications, one of  world's  leading  motion picture and television distributors, have secured the  motion  picture  and television rights to Louisa May Alcott's long-lost manuscript, "The Inheritance," in open bidding with numerous major  motion  picture  studios and production entities.
<P>
The manuscript, believed to be Alcott's first novel  and  written  at the age of 17, was found eight years ago by researchers  Joel  Myerson  (of the University of South Carolina) and Daniel Shealy  (of  the  University of North Carolina) in Harvard University's  Houghton  Library.  Written  in long-hand by Alcott -- the renowned author who went on  to  write  classics such as "Little Women" -- the manuscript has been meticulously transcribed by the two academics and only recently  revealed  to  the public.
<P>
Described as a potential family classic, "The  Inheritance"  tells  the story of an impoverished 19-year-old orphan, Edith  Adelon,  who  was embraced by a wealthy, loving family.  Driven by jealousy, a cousin tries to sabotage her relationship with the family  and  her  new-found love, by accusing her of a crime she did not commit.

<H3><b>Farm Dogs make 'Last Stand'</b></H3>

Bernie Taupin has  joined forces with musician friends Robin LeMesurier, Jim Cregan and  Dennis Tufano, to form Farm Dogs. The band's debut album, "Last Stand  In  Open Country," due out on July 9, hearkens back to the members'  musical roots, featuring songs written in-the-round in the countryside of California's Santa Ynez Valley.  It also marks their multi-album association with Discovery Records, a free-standing label of the  Warner Music Group.
<P>
Taupin, one of pop music's most prolific songwriters, developed  the urge to make an organic, stripped-down song album a year ago, and thought back to the vast backlog of musicians he'd always wanted to work with.  Guitarist LeMesurier immediately came to mind, as did vocalist/harpist Tufano and guitarist/vocalist Cregan. The  four  set upon a period of songwriting-in-the-round at Taupin's ranch in  Santa Ynez, all four co-producing with co-producer/engineer David Cole. 
<P>
Studio equipment was brought to the site of the band's  inspiration, and the album was recorded. The camaraderie formed by  the  members shines through in music that lends from styles as diverse as  rock, country, blues and traditional folk.  It is music strong on melody and lyric while maintaining a simplistic approach that is both intimate  and earthy.  "So much of the atmosphere of the album is inspired and drawn from this environment," says Taupin.  "It soaked into our veins.  It's organic, no-frills music that just invented itself."
<P>
Picture four guys sitting around in a circle playing music, swapping stories, writing songs, joking, smoking, drinking and haranguing each other mercifully, and you have Farm Dogs.

<H3><b>A 'Mother' of a co-op venture</b></H3>

"INSIDE EDITION" and  "AMERICAN JOURNAL," America's top syndicated newsmagazines, have joined forces with "Mother Jones," the nation's foremost investigative magazine,  to produce a series of hard-hitting and thought-provoking reports.
<P>
Marc Rosenweig, Vice President for East Coast Programming for King World, which distributes both shows, said the alliance's goal is  to craft eye-opening reports that will appear on air as well as in  the pages of "Mother Jones."
<P>
Early installments focused on questionable presidential campaign contributions and the growing danger tobacco chewing poses to the young.
<P>
Of the joint venture, Rosenweig said: "We're pleased  and  excited about teaming up with 'Mother Jones,' which produces some of the  most important investigations today.  We believe this association will further enhance the already strong, award-winning investigative units  of our shows to the benefit of our viewers."
<P>
"INSIDE EDITION" and "AMERICAN JOURNAL," which are seen by more  than 13 million viewers here and abroad every weekday, have consistently won honors for journalistic excellence.
<P>
This season alone reports on Medicare fraud and military recruiting fraud have either won or are in the running to win Sigma Delta Chi and Headliner Awards for Best Investigative stories.  An examination of the plight of Bosnian orphans last month garnered an American Women in  Radio and Television Commendation Award.
<P>
"Mother Jones," which reaches more than 300,000 readers,  recently was named "Best in the Business" for magazine investigative reporting  by the American Journalism Review. It recently made headlines  with  reports on the 400 richest fat cats in American politics, the tobacco  industry's efforts to curb government and social anti-smoking pressures, and  the environmental links to breast cancer.

<B>Welcome to January!</B>
 <P></P> Don't let a little ol' new year get you down.<P></P> 

<b>george jr.</b>
 brings you  some bracing writing
                                                         talent, book 
talk, wishful thinking,  a bushel of music
                                                         and literary 
links and, we hope, another measure of digitized comfort.

<P></P> 
<br clear=all>
<blockquote>   
But why, o why o why o why?, you ask. Because, we answer. Because. There are conduits to be relined, harbors to be retrenched, wells to be drilled, bridges to be flung across their spans, and sawmills and gristmills built using the new knowledge of fluid mechanics that will put the old structures to shame. <p></p> And of that we're positive.<p></p>
  This month, and not quite for starters, we offer a <b><font  color=#336699> fiction contest</font></b> in which you supply the conclusion to a story already begun by the painter<b> Elizabeth Fergus-Jean </b>and <b>g. jr.</b>The No. 1 prize: a bunch o' software, but everybody gets their conclusions published. <p></p>Elsewhere, satirist <b>Neil Steinberg</b> carps about, Lordy, everything; and novelist <b>Paula Sharp</b> talks more seriously about her latest, <i>Crows Over a Wheatfield</i>.<p></p>

 <b>Don Webb</b> pitches a seasonal story of charm and impossibility.
<b>William Kotzwinkle</b>, the man who brought us E.T. and a number of
tales, tells about his life, his writing and an odd bear 
who may or may not have made off with someone's manuscript.
; and we offer, too, a portfolio of works by painter <b>Michael Bowers.</b>This month's cover painting is <b>Ken Marschall</b>'s from <b>Shelley Tanaka</b>'s book <i>On Board the Titanic</i>, which <b>Nicholas A. Basbanes</b> reviews herein.</b><p></p>

There's much to do, and ever so much ahead. Let's go. Because next month's <b>Monkey Buttons </b> feature will stop you from reading anything for exactly 17.4 minutes, and that worries us plenty.<p>

<H2>q&a</H2> 

<h3>neil steinberg: irked up to here   </h3>



<P>

<IMG SRC="/jan97/neil.jpg" WIDTH=170 HEIGHT=156 HSPACE=15 ALIGN=left>


  <b> Neil Steinberg</b> is the author of <i>Complete & Utter Failure, If at All Possible, Involve a Cow</i> and his latest, <i>The Alphabet of Modern Annoyances</i> (Doubleday), which puts him with Paul Theroux and Kingsley Amis in the classy-whiner category. <p>
   His new book of rants slams the expecteds -  advertising, bureaucracy, computers and Disney - but also some unexpected topics, as this interview proves out:


<br clear=all>

<hr width=80%>
 
<blockquote>


<font size=5>q. </font>
What don't you find annoying?
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font> 
 Leading with the tough question, eh? OK. Food, I suppose. If it's good food. And not too expensive. And not served cold. See, that's the problem with good things: It's so easy for them to slide into annoyances. Except, perhaps, for money. Money is never annoying. I've never opened the mail and thought, "Dammit, another check! When will the horror end?" But then, of course, you have to worry about getting more money. Or losing what money you have. See, behind every good thing are a dozen annoyances, biding their time.
<p>
<font size=5>q. </font>
Do you have any particular annoying attributes you wish to share with us?
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font> 
 This is the question everybody fudges on their job interviews - "Well, my biggest flaw is I'm a perfectionist. I drive too hard for excellence and it makes all my coworkers look bad." Right.
   Searching over my litany of grating qualities and presenting just one or two is nearly an impossible task, very much lke having a fresh two-pound Whitman Sampler set before you. So much choice. Do I pick the obnoxious pendantry? The tendency toward using overlong, blowzy language? The awkward candor? The blurting out of ill-advised opinions to superiors and cherished friends? There are so many choices, I just can't pick one. Reading the book, many of them will become crystal clear.
<p>
<font size=5>q. </font>
 How do you suggest we stop the insanity?
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font> 
 You mean besides institutionalizing Susan Powter? I think a good start would be to try to encourage curiosity. So many people not only don't know anything, but aren't interested in finding anything out. They flop around on the public stage, making idiots of themselves, because they don't know enough to feel shame. And they are so wrapped up with opening their big bazoos to trumpet their opinions and demand their rights, they never pause to find out, never mind consider, how other people feel. Much annoyance is do to this.
<p>
<font size=5>q. </font>
 How did you come up with the original poem for "G Is for Gimmick"?
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font> 
 I'm going to sound like the Ultimate Pinhead of All Time saying this,but it was the first idea that I had. I wanted the tone of the chapters to reflect their subjects, and after deciding that "Gimmick" should be written gimmicky, the first thought was: "Make it a terza rima poem, parodying Dante's <i>Inferno</i>." Terza rima is that strict rhyme scheme - ABA BCB CDC - where the first and third lines rhyme, and the second line rhymes with the first line of the next triplet. It took forever, balancing a rhyming dictionary on my knees, but I worked it out. I'm most proud of rhyming "eternal" with "urinal" and <i>Wall Street Journal.</i>
<p>
<font size=5>q. </font>
Out of all your grievances - and, boy, Neil, are you an annoyed puppy - what peeves you most?
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font> 
 Postage stamps. They used to have heroes on them, Washington and Lincoln and Clara Barton and such. Now every time I look at a letter, the subject matter is steadily declining - from Elvis to Nancy and Sluggo to rag dolls. I'm expecting to go to the post office some day and be offered stamps honoring Cheetos, toilet brushes and Kato Kaelin - maybe as part of the "Famous Mopes in American History" series. It has to stop.

<h4>paula sharp: inside, looking out  </h4>

    <b>Paula Sharp</b> is the author of <i>The Woman Who Was
Not There</i> and 
<i>Lost in Jersey City</i>; and is a criminal
                                                          lawyer who has 
encountered domestic violence in
                                                          many cases. Her 
latest novel, Crows Over a Wheatfield,
 <i>Crows Over a Wheatfield,</i> is about such a case.<p>
   Her novel revolves around two very different women whose lives become intertwined: a stoic New York judge who has grown up in the shadow of her tyrannical father; and a self-styled radical who leads a John Brown-like insurrectionist movement for the rights of women trapped in abusive relationships.


<br clear=all>

<hr width=80%>

<blockquote>

<IMG SRC="/jan97/sharp2.jpg" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=155 HSPACE=15 ALIGN=right>

<font size=5>q. </font> Readers of <i>Crows Over a Wheatfield </i>will be surprised, some of them to discover that you've infused your characters with eccentricities and found humor in some of the situations they face.
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font> <i>Crows </i>isn't a comic novel, but it certainly has comic elements. Comedy is not incompatible with with difficulty or even tragedy. The best comedy has real knowledge of grief behind it.
<p>
<font size=5>q. </font> Mildred's battle to win custody of her son is a nightmare. The cutody proceedsings are used as a means of controlling and endangering her son. How have your experiences inside the legal system contributed to that aspect of your story?
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font> The criminal justice system does little to protect people against domestic violence, but it's very punitive when people defend themselves. There are countless women in prison for defending themselves against partners after years of abuse. Family Courts are the ones that are supposedly entrusted with the duties of keeping abusive parents away from their children, of issuing restraining orders against battering spouses, of fashioning custody and visitation orders to protect women and children from violence.<br> However, Family Courts are only as good as their judges. many judges are ignorant about domestic violence, or harbor prejudice against women whom they perceive as victimizing themselves, or have difficulty believing a woman's word against that of a man. For children, it's even worse: Children are rarely listened to.
<p>
<font size=5>q. </font> Do you think of yourself as a writer first, or a lawyer?
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font>I am a writer first. I wrote and translated fiction for years before I became a lawyer, and I continued to do so all through law school and afterwards. I also believed from the beginning that almost everything I was exposed to in the criminal-justice world would have to make me a better writer. You spend a lot more time as a criminal lawyer trying to puzzle people together, making sense of their motives and figuring out how the circumstances of their lives led them down the wrong roads.
<p>
<font size=5>q. </font> But court proceedsings help you write better, and plot a narrative?
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font> The professionals who form the criminal-justice system are fascinating - the judges, prosecutors and defenders. What kind of people like to judge others? Prosecute and punish them? Play with rules in order to protect people who have broken rules, however guilty they may be? As a public defender, you try to understand why some people need to punish, or to avenge wrongs in order to feel whole, and why others are able to temper justice with mercy. <br><br>You test the depths of your personal capacity for compassion. You have to ask yourself where your own sense of justice comes from, and what justice really is.

<H2>joe napora: on meridel le sueur</H2>

<blockquote>
<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="nepora.jpg" hspace=10 WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=122 border=0>
On November 7, exactly one week before she died, I received a letter from
<B>Meridel Le Sueur</B>. The handwriting was difficult to decipher; she had been in
the hospital since January. She had not been in good health for years. <P>
My
students who  each semester read her novel <I>The Girl,</I> knowing that she had
been born in 1900, would often ask if she was still alive. I would answer,
"Yes" and begin a tale of life and work: quitting school at 16, going to
Hollywood and working as a stunt woman, living with Emma Goldman, meeting
all the great political radicals and radical writers, being harassed by the
government, her children's stories, her poetry, her very human spirit of
endurance. "Survival," she said, "is a form of resistance." <P>

	Now I must answer, "Yes, she is alive but only in the spirit revealed in
her writing and expressed through the influence she had on those who knew
her." And she was a great spirit. Though we met only a few times, her
writing made an organic connection with me: I considered her one of my
dearest friends. We had been out of touch for several years but got
re-connected just before she died. More than any writer I know, she
struggled with the processes inherent in the act of writing. 
<P>


She spoke of
this struggle in cultural / political terms as "the fetish of being
outside." She knew that the greatest challenge for a writer is to be both
witness and participant, and she lived this challenge as did no other. And,
of course, she suffered for this integral belief. The FBI hounded her and
her family. Publishers blacklisted her. Literary associates shunned her
because she refused to adhere to their particular party line. But when the
books were made available, often through heroic efforts on the part of small
press publishers, the readers responded. The readers were always out in
front of the critics. Someday when more of her writings are published, her
notebooks and her notes for novels she was working on, people will see what
an amazing innovator she was. Her influence on American fiction is yet to be
fully felt. <P>

	 In her
letter to me she asked if I could collaborate with her on a sequel to her
novel <I>The Dread Road. </I>She did not really expect this of us, though if I
lived nearby and she were in good health we would have considered. I suspect
she asked this of others as well. I had read that novel in manuscript nearly
fifteen years ago, and it has haunted me ever since. <P>
It is innovative (not
experimental since she was so sure of her technique) and political (not
"politically correct" since she was so sure of her basic instincts and
loyalties) in a way that the American literary establishment seems only
capable in appreciating in the fiction of foreigners. She wrote in the
letter that "all real writing is collective."<P>
 She wrote from that belief in
the midst of the impossibility of its realization. And for that I admired
her more than any other writer I know. And for her living out the most basic
of metaphors, its heart and soul, the ability to "carry across" meaning
through language, she exposed every genuine writer's essential vulnerability
before the mystery of human language.<P>
 And in this heartless and soulless
time, her living through nearly the entirety of the bloodiest century of our
history, she persevered. And because of  her ability with our language and
her faith in our humanity,  we loved her.<P>

<H2>the literary fruitcake</H2>

<SUB>for Allen Varney and Mary Denning</SUB>
<P>
<B>by don webb</B>
<P>

<I>A Literary Fruitcake</I> is one of the short magical works from Don Webb's short-fiction collection <I>A Spell for the Fulfillment of Desire</I> (Black Ice Books), a postmodern papyrus presenting Webb's unique views on language, fiction and history. <P>
Webb won the 1988 Illinois State University/Fiction Collective Prize for his earlier book, <I>Uncle Ovid's Exercise Book.</I><P>
<hr>
<blockquote>
I bought the fruitcake from Mary Denning.  Mary had opened a shop on Haight selling Beat Generation memorabilia.  Like most of Mary's enterprises, it was open for a few months and then disappeared as quickly -- and like most of her shops, I had the feeling that there was more going on than simple commerce -- but as Mary remarked to me when she sold me the item, "There's a mystery in money."
The fruitcake was in a shoebox in the Kerouac section.  It was marked two hundred and fifty bucks, which seemed a bit much for a frankly dusty piece of overhard pastry (even if Kerouac had owned it).  I said to Mary, "So what's the story here?  Kerouac's mom bake this or what?  Genuine French-Canadian fruitcake?"<P>

"Ginsberg gave it to him.  Burroughs gave it to Ginsberg.  In fact there's quite a history on that little number."<P>

She passed me a two-page pamphlet printed on pseudo-parchment.
<I>

The History of the Literary Fruitcake.</I><P>

<IMG ALIGN=left SRC="fruitcake.jpg" hspace=10 WIDTH=105 HEIGHT=128 border=0>
<I>You are what you eat.</I><br>
The custom of giving fruitcakes was introduced to the English-speaking world by Queen Victoria, and this wonderful example of the liquor-preserved candied-fruit cake was actually among the first ever given.  Like the <I>stollens</I> of Victoria's native Germany, such cakes often had more than one owner; and few cakes in the history of cakedom have had as distinguished a pedigree as this piece of realia.<P>
 <SUB>(Author's note <I>realia </I> is a term from library science for a nonbook piece of literary remains.)</SUB><P>

<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="dickens.jpg" hspace=10 WIDTH=111 HEIGHT=128 border=0>
In 1843 Queen Victoria attended the first dramatic reading of Charles Dickens's <I>A Christmas Carol.</I>  Her Majesty was so impressed at the young writer's ghostly Yule tale, she placed him on the royal fruitcake list.  This cake was dutifully delivered to Dickens's home on Christmas Eve 1843.  The original presentation card and box have since disintegrated.  The card bearing the inscription "To Boz Love Vicky" was added by Alice B. Toklas when the cake was in the possession of Gertrude Stein.<P>

Mr. Dickens treasured the cake as a conversation piece for a number of years.  When he began his affair with the actress Ellen Ternan, the cake became a much talked-about item in the theater circuit.  The young Bram Stoker purloined the cake during the publication party of<I> Our Mutual Friend </I> in 1865.  He later confessed his cake-napping to Dickens and offered to return it, but Dickens said that if the cake had such meaning for him he could keep it.  At that time Stoker was an unpaid drama critic for the Dublin <I>Mail.</I><P>

For years Stoker would show off the cake, indeed after Dickens's death swore that he would eat it up and then finish <I>Edwin Drood. </I> However, Stoker's theatrical guests tired of the tale and the cake went into storage.  At the publication of Dracula in 1987, Stoker mentioned the tale to Arthur Machen, who asked to see the cake.<P>

Stoker not only displayed the cake but presented the Welshman with it.  Machen was overjoyed at first.  Here was a suitable offering to give to the Spirit of Inspiration at a Golden Dawn ceremony that he intended to attend.  The Spirit of Inspiration was personified by a fellow ghost tale writer, Algernon Blackwood.  Blackwood took the cake home and put it away in a closet.<P>

The century turned.  The cake aged, and Algernon Blackwood still seeking mystical experience went to Gurdjieff's retreat at Fontainbleu.  There he met Margaret Anderson, publisher of Gertrude Stein and James Joyce.  He presented her with the cake -- in the hopes that she would pass it along to Stein.  Stein, who had a low opinion of Dickens, was not thrilled with the cake -- but it is rumored that Alice B. Toklas did come up with her famous recipe for hashish brownies shortly after the cake's arrival.<P>

Stein wrote a poem about the cake:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Four ghosts in a Carol<BR>

	And five writers on one cake<BR>

	And Carol is a carol is a carol.<BR>

	Outed a ghostly cake.<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<IMG ALIGN=left SRC="hemingway.jpg" hspace=10 WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=128 border=0>
Earnest Hemingway applauded the verse, when he first heard it( at a drinking party Stein hosted for Picasso), and Gertrude rewarded him the cake.  Hemingway recorded the entire incident in <I>A Movable Feast </I>(including his suspicions of Alice B. Toklas creating the "Love Vicky" card while under the influence of hashish).  Hemingway had for a long time wished to meet the by-then blind James Joyce.  Deciding that such an interesting cake would be a suitable gift, Hemingway went to Joyce's home in Paris.  He presented the cake to Joyce's secretary Samuel Beckett, who told Hemingway that Mr. Joyce no longer received visitors.  Joyce did later send Hemingway a thank-you card.<P>

At Joyce's death the fruitcake passed on to Samuel Beckett, who in the lean years prior to <I>Godot </I> often thought of eating it.  However, money, fame, and his general dislike of sweets combined to keep the cake intact.<P>

<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="burroughs.jpg" hspace=10 WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=111 border=0>
In 1959 William S. Burroughs came to Paris to work out details for publishing <I>Naked Lunch.</I>  He attempted to pay a visit to his writerly hero Samuel Beckett.  The reclusive Beckett allowed Burroughs in his home for only half an hour -- then ordered him to leave.  Burroughs wanting a souvenir of the visit took what he believed to be a brick from the bottom of Beckett's hall closet.<P>

When he returned to Tangier he discovered that it was a fruitcake (and borrowing Paul Bowles copy of <I>A Moveable Feast</I>  read Hemingway's account of same).  He decided that it would make a great gift to one of the occasional visiting writers from the States.<P>

in 1962 Allen Ginsberg visited William S. Burroughs and briefed him on the <I>Naked Lunch </I> obscenity trial.  During the visit Burroughs wrapped the fruitcake in a shoebox and wrote the words:  REALITY SANDWICH FROM UNCLE BILL'S DINER on the outside and gave it to Ginsberg - with instructions not to open till Hanukkah.<P>

At the beginning of Hanukkah 1963 Jack Kerouac was in New York for an interview with William Buckley.  Kerouac's drunken and slovenly appearance coupled with his remarks about the then emerging hippie culture pretty much ended his career and popularity.<P>

As Kerouac prepared to leave New York, Ginsberg presented him with the fruitcake, which he had opened the night before.  Kerouac took it home.  
Toward the end of his life, Kerouac regretted the remarks on the hippie culture, and had the fruitcake shipped to Richard Farina.  Kerouac had read <I>Been Down So Long It looks Like Up To Me</I> in an advanced proof copy, and realizes that beatitiude could live on in hippie writting. Farina received the cake days before his tragic death, and like most of Farina's literary remains, the fruitcake passed to Thomas Pynchon.  Pynchon traded the fruitcake to Mary Denning in exchange for her expert knowledge on pre-WWII German organic chemistry texts.  You can now own this wonderful piece of literary history now entering its 150th year.<P>

<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="fruitcake2.jpg" hspace=10 WIDTH=62 HEIGHT=128 border=0>
Of course I had to have it.  To have my name associated with the great stream of literary becoming was too wonderful to pass up.  I never doubted the story of the cake for I have never known Mary Denning to lie.  In fact her honesty is often what made her scary and powerful.<P>

I wrote a check and took the fruitcake to my hotel, then on to my Austin home.  Slowly I began to wonder what spiritual energies the cake might contain.  Perhaps the ghosts of <I>A Christmas Carol, </I> the eroticism of <I>Dracula, </I>the ultramundane horror of "The Great God Pan," the chill of "The Willows," the mind-freeing syntax of <I>How to Write, </I> the understanding of machismo in The Sun Also Rises, the architectonic sweep of <I>Ulysses,</I>  the alienage of <I>Malone Dies,</I>  well you get the idea by now.  If there was even a chance that some of those vibrations lay in Victoria's gift -- my writing would be transformed and improved by the word of these masters.  And if not, at least the literary legend that could come from my eating the cake.  I would earn my place as a footnote in the<I> Oxford Book of Literary Anecdotes.  <P></I>

And in some sense hadn't I already eaten the fruitcake, before I even saw it?  Had not each of these writers nourished me, prepared me for my task?<P>

I told a few close friends that I would eat the fruitcake on Christmas Eve of 1993.  I fasted all day.  In the evening I attended a Christmas party, but when my lovely wife and I returned home, we discovered our house had been looted.
TV, VCR, PC and even items of value not easily acronymed had been taken.  We called the police and consoled each other with love.<P>

Then I found the fruitcake was gone.<P>

No doubt some snack - or more likely bitten into and tossed away as hopelessly stale.<P>

I looked around the neighborhood for awhile, but saw no cake fragments.
Then I saw the graffiti on the back of the 7-11.  It, as you know, was the beginning of the greatest novel in the English language.  I called to the store owner.  She read along with me and wept at the beauty.<P>

Over the next few months, the graffiti began to cover wall after wall -- as the driven thief released the intensity of his soul.  Soon people from far away came to Austin. We never sought out the writer, for we feared our presence might interfere with his process, but we grew fiercely proud of the words that covered our walls.<P>

Soon all of Austin was obscured by the words of perfection.<P>

We, who dwell in the holy shrines, will preserve this treasure unto the ends of time.<P>

<H3>william kotzwinkle: the story of himself
and 'The Bear Went Over the Mountain'</H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/jan97/koltz1.jpg" WIDTH=155 HEIGHT=220 HSPACE=15 ALIGN=left>



Widely known as the author of <I>E.T., the Estraterrestrial</I>, <B>William Kotzwinkle</B> also wrote<I> The Fan Man, Doctor Rat</I> and other books that have been translated into a dozen languages. The French think of him as a political satirist, the Germans see him as a Tantric mystic and, in a recent article in the Croation magazine, <I>Kult</I>, he is called the "original master of magic realism."
   His latest satire is <I>The Bear Went Over the Mountain </I>(Doubleday), in which a bear finds a manuscript in rural Maine, decides it's pretty good, gets an agent, a publicist and becomes an overnight sensation.

<HR>
<p>
<br clear=all>I was born in Scranton, Pa. This fact cannot be altered, though everything else that follows can be manipulated, and will be, to my advantage. My grandfather was a fisherman, and I was frequently taken on visits to the firehouse where I was alowed to slide down the fire pole. It affected me deeply, and left me with a feeling that stairs are a nuissance.
<P>

As a teen-ager, I ate a Christmas tree ornament to impress a girl. She was not impressed. I attended Penn State where I am remembered for an underground apartment called the SpiderWeb. Here I learned to play the bongo drums all night long, to the delight of the engineering students who lived in the apartment above me. I recently met a woman who said she'd attended Penn State and that once she entered my apartment when I wasn't there in order to clean my stove, whose condition toubled her sleep. I have no memory of this.
<P>

In those days, co-eds were not allowed to enter young men's apartments even to clean their stoves. Hard to believe, isn't it? I couldn't believe it, and had co-eds in my apartment. One day a telephone call came to the SpiderWeb for a co-ed who was seated beside me at that very moment. The only one in the world who knew she was there was her roommate. I handed the phone to her. The voice that came through the line was that of the housemother of her dorm. We'd been set up by the roommate, who'd been pressured by the housemother. This was my first experience of the deviousness of housemothers and it altered my view of them, permanently. I was asked to leave Penn State, and did, under a cloud.
<P>

<IMG SRC="/jan97/koltz2.jpg" WIDTH=151 HEIGHT=220 HSPACE=15 ALIGN=right>
I went to New York where I got a job in the basement of Merit Farms painting barbeque chicken signs - a plucked chicken in red, with the price per pound. I was taught this art by a Cuban refugee, who once painted gigantic murals of Batista in downtown Havana. One day, out of despair, he painted his hair red. It was thought that I'd somehow encouraged him to do this. As he was a great painter of barbeque chickens and I was only a fumbling apprentice, I was asked to leave, which I did, under a cloud.
<P>

I then worked at Paramount Theatrical Supplies and mailed rubber noses to actors. I worked at the Douglas Massage Manufacturing Co., assembling vibrators for enthusiasts. I cooked nights at the Figaro and once served a cheeseburger with lettuce and tomato and neglected to insert the burger. The waitress brought it back with a bite out of it and said, "What the hell is this?" I was asked to leave, which I did, under a cloud.
<P>

I worked as a department store Santa at E.J. Korvette's department store. A child stuck her lollipop in my bead and was unable to extract it. She cried, "Santa Claus stole my lollipop!" and yanked. It came out covered with hair. I was asked to leave, which I did, et cetera.
<P>

And then I joined fellow Penn Stater Joe Servello, who'd once painted a mural of lovely young naked women on the wall of the SpiderWeb, much to the landlord's consternation. Now here was Servello in New York, paint brush in hand. In between serving burgers without the burgers, I'd written a children's book. Servello illustrated it and we got in published. The book was called <I>The Firemen</I> - influence of the old fire pole. After that I wrote my first collection of stories, <I>Elephant Bangs Train</I>, which enjoyed critical success, but made no money. On the strength of this critical success, I married the novelist Elizabeth Gundy, at the Breadloaf Writer's Conference in Vermont, and we moved to Canada, where a bear stole Elizabeth's manuscript.
<P>

And that is the story of my life.
<P>

<blockquote>
<font color=red>Note: </font>Why, just the other day, the <B>george jr.</B> clubhouse was gathered around a fire wondering why it is that some people began their sentences with the word "why" - and then a story began to brew - right there, atop Hollywood's copper-domed Griffith Observatory, which, of course you've seen on the cover of the  Byrds' 1970 album <I>Untitled</I> and, more famously in <I>Rebel Without a Cause</I>. There we were, stars streaking by overhead and myths and archetypes bubbling from the very ground beneath.<P>
But - o, my! - how does it end? With what pinch of Perreault? With what gram of Grimm? With what touch of (Hunter S.) Thompson? How? How? That, dear reader, is up to you. Send in your Amazing Conclusions, and we'll publish 'em in <A HREF="mailto:jr@georgejr.com"><b>george jr.</b></A><P>
<HR>

<H5>and now, once upon a time:</H5>
<br>

<H2>father's tears, mother's bones</H2>
<br>

        Long missing from the woods, she turned abruptly from the
flowered path and strove into the thicket. She realized at once that she had
at last found her true home. She stepped into a trickling stream, and
got wet.<P>

      As she tried to step back onto the mossy shore, she found
her left foot was stuck. She reached down and freed herself and, while
peering into the water, saw a glistening blue egg, which she picked up.
The egg
began to move in her hand, ever so slightly. She cupped it, breathing
warmly on the shell. She heard a faint sound and saw a thin crack form and
slowly increased in size.<P>

     She brought the egg up very slowly to her face and peered in.<P>

      <I>  Oofffffft! </I>She was sucked inside.<P>

<img align=right hspace=10 width=128 height=123 src=fiction1.jpg>

       Inside the egg she seemed to be swirling and tumbling in the
yolk's gel slowly and more slowly - until she came to rest before a bearded
man whittling stars.<P>

        "Where am I?," she asked.<P>

         "You are here, with me," he said. Here, let me feed you
 something.

 You look hungry." He put a sliver of star between her lips.<P>

         "Mmm, tastes good," she said. "A wee bit salty, though."<P>

         "It should," he said. "And it should taste familiar, too, because
 it's made of your father's tears and your mother's bones."<P>

         A tear formed in her eye for she knew this to be true. She had
 known since she was a young girl that she was somehow related to all the
 elements of nature. She thought of how she loved to spend endless
 hours in
 the evening starring up at the stars, and feeling as if they were her all
 ancestors.<P>

<img align=left hspace=10 width=128 height=119 src=fiction2.jpg>

         "Now," he said, "Take this star back with you. Cut it in slivers
 and spread them on the ground of the people - your family and
 friends, your
 loved ones and former lovers, your children and neighbores - and tend to
 these slivers. Nurture them, so that they too may grow. Once you see how
 easy it is to cut them into splinters and spread them around, it'll be
 hard to stop.<P>

    "This is so strange," she said. "Is this a dream?"<P>

  "Not exactly. Not quite," he said, and he turned to his workbench of
 stars and diced up several more. Some of the shavings he put into his own
  pocket. He held two handfuls out to the young woman, who gently took
 them.<P>

   "What's your name?," he asked.<P>

<img align=right hspace=10 width=123 height=126 src=fiction3.jpg>
     She lifted her head and looked into his eyes. She heard him ask again,
 "What's your name?," and she realized that he hadn't moved his mouth. They
 had been communicating this entire time simply through their minds. This
 did not frighten her, however she did not know how it could be so.<P>

    "Alana," she said.<P>

     "Ah, Alana. You will need more tools than a pocketful of stars."<P>

     He reached behind his ebony chair and brought out a walking cane the
 color of tar pitch, a round ball, sembling nothing more unusual than the
 kind of rubber ball that can be found everywhere, and a white stone or
 scrimshaw the size of his open palm.<P>

    "Each of these will help you along your way," he said.<P>

    "My way?" she asked. "But what is my way."<P>

    "Out from here," he said, and he reached to her forehead, laying one
 hand on her left temple; and kissed her in a grandfatherly sort of way.<P>

    And she was gone.<P>


         Alana heard the rustle of leaves, and birds chattering away in the
 trees over her head. She reached out her hands and found that she had
 fallen asleep on the mossy shore next to the stream she had been wading in.
 Alana sat up, and as she did a rush of images flooded her mind.<P>

         What a strange dream, she thought.<P>

            But by her side she found a ball, a cane, a small white stone
 and, burning warmly in her pocket, a small white slice of melon. No, no.
 It was a piece of something. It looked like a sliver of star - o, how it
 glowed.<P>

         She turned the sliver over and over in her hands, and as she did
  this, she remembered the kind face of the white bearded man. She closed
her
  eyes and tried to recall exactly what this man had said to her.<P>

    Soon enough, a young man happened by and woke her from her reverie.<P>

    "Hey," he said, and repeated himself as she was slow to return to the
 present. "Hey, halloooo," he said.<P>

    "Hello," she said.<P>

    "You looked like you were, well, out of it," he said. "Listen, pardon
 me for barging in on you, but where did you get the cane? Check this out."
    He rolled up his left trouser cuff and revealed a small gash and deep
 bruise.<P>

    "A horse. It was a horse," he said. "It was just standing there, off
 to the side of the footpath. I thought maybe I could pet it, or get ahold
 of its bridle. Nope. It kicked me right here. I've got a long way to go.
 It's killing me."<P>

    He gestured toward her cane. "I'd like to get me one of those," he
 said.<P>

         She looked down at the cane. This is all so incredibly weird, she
 thought. Strange men kept popping into her life. Maybe she was meant to
 give the cane to this man standing before her. It wasn't really her own
 cane to begin with, it had been given to her, and maybe just for this very
 moment.<P>

         What was it he had said about a horse? A horse!?<P>

         "A horse, around here?" She asked.<P>

        Before he could answer, Alana stood up and began to scan the
horizon. She saw nothing that might resemble a horse. Was this guy for
real? She leaned down to closer inspect his injury, and gently touch it.
        "Ouch!!!" he said. "Hey, it's real already!"<P>

        "Oh, I'm sorry," she said. She put her hand just below the wound.


        She sat down and drew him towards her. Moving his injured leg into
her lap, she slowly began to massage his leg. He closed his eyes and melted
into the moment.<P>

  When he opened his eyes and looked at his leg, he found it healed.<P>

   "Yikes," he said. "How did THAT happen?" At that moment, he heard the
whinnying of the horse. he turned around and there it was, munching some
eel grass growing by the road. He and Alana stood and walked toward the
horse. Her hand might have brushed against his side, but maybe it didn't.
He climbed upon the horse, which allowed him to, and he rode off.<P>

        Alana watched as he rode over the hill. She had the urge to follow
him, so she went back to where she had been sitting to gather up her
things. When she reached the edge of the stream she located the spot where
she had been, and began to pick up the items on the ground. She picked up
the ball and rolled it around in her palm. It was so smooth and cool. She
looked into its polished surface and gasped at what she saw: an image of
the young man, riding off; and another, of an elderly woman meandering
toward her, along the very same path.<P>

   Alana turned just in time.<P>

   "Hello," said the woman. Her coarse-looking hair was the color of
steel. A red bandana she wore around it gave her the countenance of a warrior.
   "Hello," said Alana.<P>

   "I know, I know," said the woman. "You saw me in the polished stone,
just as I appeared behind you. I know all about it. I carried that same
stone with me for nearly 40 years."<P>

   Alana gasped. "You mean you know all about this? You mean, you can
tell me what this is all about?"<P>

       "Well, yes and no," she said as she sat down by the stream. She
leaned over, cupped her hands, then dipped them into the clear water and
drank. "My, that water tastes so good. Here, please come sit down next to
me,  and I will share with you what I can. I presume you have met my dear
friend and guild, the alchemist."<P>

<H2>white house e-mail</H2>

Thanks to our friends at the National Security Archive, Tom Blanton and 

The New

Press, <b>george jr.</b> is able to bring you, raw and unplugged, 

genuine-article, top-secret

messages - from Blanton's book, White House E-mail - that the Reagan/Bush 

White

House tried to destroy. 

<P>

We'll bring you several of their actual email messages a week, until heck freezes over,  without editorial gloss.

<P>

<A HREF="whtech.html">Techies</A> will want to know: These messages are scanned ASCII  text files on DOS-formatted disk (edited by Blanton, produced by Ian Stevenson with technical gizmonics from John Martinez).

<P>

In case you've forgotten--here's a <A HREF="whwhowho.html">who's who</A>, the rogue's gallery from the Reagan-Bush years. And for those, who like us can  barely remember what we had for breakfast, here's a <A HREF="whchron.html">chronology</A> of  White House events.

<P>

Let's jump right in.....

NOTE FROM: DONALD R. FORTIER
SUBJECT: Sovs and Summit
I see from INR summit Hungarians are not too pleased by the 
direction of new Soviet leadership.  Is this a theme, more broadly, 
we ought to begin to play upon:  less liberalization in east, etc.

GREAT! We are locking up and going ashore. About 11:30 
tomorrow, we will have eggnog (spiked) for you and Judyt and 
Helen.

NOTE FROM: Steven Steiner 
Subject: Status of Nuclear Testing Issue
Bill, the cable to allies referred to here is the one I discussed with 
Bev. I tubed to you the cable as worked and fully cleared 
interagency in Timbie's office a few minutes ago. Timbie said S/S 
does intend to cross hatch it, so could you please ensure that it 
goes tonite. It is already cleared here by Matlock, Linhard, Wright 
and myself. Thanks.
         
This cable also indicates how we intend (hope) to handle this 
publicly -- see last 3 paras.

NOTE FROM: ROBERT E. LINHARD
SUBJECT: Status of Nuclear Testing Issue
THIS IS A SHORT STATUS REPORT ON THE NUCLEAR 
TESTING ISSUE.  WE HAVE A SIGNED NSDD AND THE 
APPROPRIATE COVER MEMORANDUM TO DISTRIBUTE THE 
NSDD IS AWAITING SIGNATURE AND RELEASE.  IT WOULD 
BE BEST IF THE SIGNED NSDD COULD BE CIRCULATED BY 
OOB TOMORROW (TUESDAY).
         
THE TEXT OF THE MESSAGE TO GORBACHEV HAS BEEN 
REVIEWED BY MATLOCK AND PROVIDED TO STATE FOR 
FORMATTING AND TRANSMISSION THIS EVENING. IT WILL BE 
DELIVERED IN MOSCOW TOMORROW (WITH NO SIGNED 
ORIGINAL TO FOLLOW).
         
A MESSAGE TO ALLIES HAS BEEN DRAFTED AND STEINER IS 
COORDINATING IT AT STATE WITH OSD, JCS, STATE, ACDA, 
AND CIA.  IT, TOO, SHOULD GO THIS EVENING SO THAT 
ALLIES CAN BE BRIEFED AS THE GORBACHEV MESSAGE IS 
IMPLEMENTED IN MOSCOW.
         
BILL WRIGHT WILL PROVIDE TO LYNN SACHS A SET OF 
BRIEF TALKING POINTS FOR USE IN THE MORNING TO 
NOTIFY KEY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.
         
WE PLAN NO PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE 
PRESIDENT"S RESPONSE -- AND IF PRESSED WE WOULD 
SIMPLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE HAS RESPONDED AND 
OFFERED SOME NEW IDEAS.  WE WOULD DRAW ON 
EXISTING MATERIAL TO MAKE IT CLEAR (AS NECESSARY) 
WHY THE SOVIET IDEA OF A MORATORIUM ON TESTING IS 
UNACCEPTABLE TO US.  IN SHORT, WE WILL TRY TO RUN 
SILENT FOR A BIT TO SEE IF MOSCOW WILL RESPOND 
POSITIVELY TO ANY OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE LETTER.
         
NOT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE, THE THRUST OF US RESPONSE 
IS TO PROPOSE AN EXPERTS' MEETING TO DISCUSS ANY 
"COMMON GROUND" BETWEEN THE US AND SOVIET 
NUCLEAR TESTING PROPOSALS TO BE HELD IN FEBRUARY 
(LOCALE UNSPECIFIED).  WE DO NOT ACCEPT THE SOVIET

NOTE FROM: ROBERT E. LINHARD
Subject: MEMO FOR THE PRESIDENT
Per the note sent to you on PROFs last night, we have in the 
system a short summary of the consultations to date. We hoped to 
get it to you last night or this morning, so that you could give the 
President an update. It does a good job of reviewing the Allied 
views -- but does not go into great detail on next steps.
   On the next steps issue, we have a meeting this morning at State 
of all SACG and ACSG principals to get a debriefing on the trips. I 
will then chair a ACSG meeting this afternoon to discuss next steps. 
I think that the consultation process has really bought us some 
running room. Our options now are: (1) modify our INF position to 
reflect Allied concerns (and we have a good ideaon how that can be 
done, and how it could help strengthen our position in the process), 
or (2) hang tuff on our November 1 INF position (as a result of some 
Allied concerns). I think that we should work towards a final 
decision about Thursday of next week, to be followed by a follow-up 
consultation via diplomatic channels, leading to a US action just 
prior to the Soviet party congress (perhaps with some echoes in the 
defense speech). I will send you a longer PROFs with more detail 
on this later today.
   On the substance of the alternative INF position, Ron and I have 
been working on an options (much really good thought by Ron) to 
have us propose a staged INF reduction: (1) we both reduce to our 
140 missile level (echo of Nov 1) in 2 to 3 years, with proportional 
reductions in Asia (2) we both go to zero in Europe and the Far 
East in the next few years (Soviets can retain systems only in 
central USSR (between 90 and 85 degrees -- or at Novosibirsk and 
Barnaul only -- US with matching number in CONUS), then, (3) all 
go to zero. I find this may work CAPs concerns and the concerns of 
the Japanese, UK, France and the Dutch -- while showing we really 
consult (which undercuts Soviet efforts to divide Allies) and while 
conserving US negotiating capital.
   Will give you a fuller read-out later. Hope this is enough, with last 
nite's package, to give you material to brief the President. If not, 
please advise.

Subject: INF - URGENT
PAUL, PER CONVERSATION WITH THE ADMIRAL, PLEASE 
PASS THIS TO HIM SOONEST.

ADMIRAL, ATTACHED IS THE PROFS THAT I GOT THIS 
MORNING AND WHICH WE DISCUSSED EARLIER.  RON AND I 
HAVE TALKED, AND WE BOTH UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER.  
WE BOTH RECOGNIZE THE CRITICAL DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN C AND F IS WHETHER YOU CALL FOR A ZERO-
ZERO IN EUROPE AT ANY POINT SHORT OF A GLOBAL ZERO.
         
I THINK THAT WE COULD SUPPORT MAKING C A BIT 
STRONGER BY INCLUDING A CALL FOR A SOVIET 
COMMITMENT TO A DATE CERTAIN FOR THE ULTIMATE 
ELIMINATION OF LRINF (AS IN F).  IF F IS CHOSEN, WE 
WOULD WANT TO ADD A SECTION TO THE NSDD INDICATING 
THAT WHEN WE MOVE TO 80% REDUCTIONS GLOBALLY, 
THE US WILL CONSIDER SOVIET LRINF BASING AND 
EVALUATE OUR OWN BASING IN LIGHT OF THIS.  IN A 
SENSE, THIS OPTENS THE DOOR TO THE FUTURE OPTIONS 
WHICH RON ARGUES FOR.
         
WE ARE RESEARCHING THE TURKEY ISSUE NOW.  WILL 
HAVE A MORE DETAILED PROFS IN ABOUT 1 HOUR OR SO.  
INITIAL REACTIONS:
   1. REMEMBER TURKEY IS IN "NATO EUROPE".
   2. NOT SURE THAT THE KENNEDY - KRUSCHEV 
AGREEMENT ON CUBA DOES NOT APPLY HERE -- WE ARE 
TRYING TO RESEARCH, BUT I REALLY DON'T HAVE ACCESS .
   3. WILL PROVIDE HISTORY OF WHY TURKEY WAS NOT AN 
ORIGINAL BASING        COUNTRY.
   4. SHOULD CONSIDER GREEK REACTION.
   5. SHOULD GUARD AGAINST A "QUICK FIX" THAT MAY NOT 
BE                 IMPLEMENTABLE.  WOULD SUGGEST THAT IF A 
DECISION HINDGES ON THIS, QUITE A BIT OF STAFFING 
WITH THE TURKS (AND GREEKS) MAY BE NEEDED.
   6. FINALLY, IF YOU ARE LOOKING A SUCH OPTIONS, 
SHOULD ALSO            CONSIDER S.KOREA BUT SAME 
CAREFULL STAFFING NEEDED.

NOTE FROM: RONALD F. LEHMAN
SUBJECT: INF - URGENT
In reference to System II 90126, INF Options, I share your concerns 
about Option C but believe that we are protected against the major 
dangers if we simply state that the package is contingent upon 
agreement to a specific date for the total elimination of all LRINF 
missiles.  With that change, we achieve extensive negotiating 
flexibility, link zero in Europe and the Far East to zero globally, and 
will have simply refined the President's previous decision to improve 
it based upon inputs from allies and our own resources.  Like A and 
F, this would reinvigorate our own version of zero.  Option F 
involves essentially no substantive movement in INF and 
backtracks significantly from what we have already told the allies we 
would be prepared to do.  Although we can try to put the best light 
on it, very quickly the story will be that the Reagan Administration 
was not up to the challenge of Gorbachev and the usual stupid 
rhetoric.  More importantly, our allies have all formally come on 
board with zero in Europe despite their very real reservations and 
they will not help us on this one.  On the contrary, they will moan, 
live with it, but then pocket this one and put pressure on us to move 
in other areas.  Furthermore, Option F is such a change in direction 
from where our allies are now forward leaning that many are going 
to be caught very much off guard.
My recommendation is Option C modified so that the zero in Europe 
and the Far East is contingent upon agreement to a date certain for 
the elimination of LRINF globally.  If that is not acceptable, then I 
would propose that we go with Option F in the following way.  That 
we present it to the allies as our proposed position but with the 
option to be presented to the Soviets that if the number of warheads 
where reduced significantly below 270 RVs on a reduction schedule 
which ends with zero LRINF globally, we could entertain a proposal 
that would result in an interim period during which there would be 
zero in Europe and zero in the Far East.  Again, agreement to a 
date certain on zero LRINF globally would be a precondition.We 
would thus have put forward a tough and creative package and the 
burden wollld be sharedwith the allies.

NOTE FROM: ROBERT MCFARLANE
Subject: MISSIONS
Roger on the Iranian issue.
         
With regard to the Geneva talks, let me get something off my chest. 
I have worried for some time--going back to last summer--that the 
delayed pace of serious analytical work to define just what we are 
after on the mix between offense and defense and the derivative 
questions such as how to conduct the transition, how to respond to 
critics (and Russian) charges that SDI is intended for offensive 
purposes etc. will put us in an impossible position vis-a-vis both the 
Russians in Geneva and the Congress. Those fears are proving 
out. They are exacerbated by the deficit problem to the extent that it 
makes it all that easier for people to cut SDI. But I see a future (six 
months from now) when the Russians will conclude that we have 
lost control of the appropriation process. By that time they will have 
seen-absent an initiative from the President--the congress move 
several domestic bills at higher levels than requested. Over time 
(even with vetos) the climate will sour even more on the Hill as the 
election nears and vetos will become harder. Defense will come last 
and because at least some domestic bills will have already been 
enacted over budget, the pressure to take more out of defense will 
be even greater. The Russians will watch all this with some 
amusement and pleasure and probably slow down the Geneva talks 
or become more unyielding given our propensity to cut our own 
programs--including SDI (which will be the case if, by that time, we 
don't have answers to the central questions on the future of the 
program and how it relates to arms control.)
         
The only way I see to avoid this is to take the initiative now to get 
the best deal you can on defense. It seems to me that the Packard 
Commission provides a good foundation for launching such an 
effort. The President could call together the leading bipartisan 
players on national security issues from the congress (Nunn, 
Goldwater, Aspin, Dickenson etc) and say he has reviewed the 
report and endorses it. The specific changes he would recommend 
would include:
         
   -A reinvigorated PPBS (as Packard recommends).
         
   -Congressional reform (less micromanagement) and a 
commitment to a five year (two years as a fallback)appropriation.
         
   -Agreement to the first two years being at a level of 2% real 
growth each year.
         
   -He would concurrently appoint a Bipartisan Board to serve with 
staggered terms in perpetuity to advise on national security issues. 
They wold be asked to report on an interim basis within two months 
and then annually forever. It might include, as part of the first effort 
"Congressional Advisors" who would take part in forging the first 
report.
         
   -Then the Board would be named (HAK might be a good 
Chairman)_ to include Harold Brown and half a dozen other 
heavies.
         
A variant would be not to propose the compromise until the Board 
recommends it two months from now with the Congress asked to 
suspend work on the defense budget until the reports comes in.
         
  Unless this concept or something like it which gets the initiative 
back in the White House is tried, by September we will be watching 
the investment of the past five years go down the tubes, the victim 
of congressional preoccupation with the deficit (thanks to Don 
Regan and Gramm Rudman). With it goes arms control and before 
long, we will be seeing a more ambitious Soviet Union a la the late 
70's.
         
One reason I believe that the scheme might work is that there are 
several politically ambitious Democrats (Nunn and Aspin) who 
understand that it will not be smart to be the party that cut defense 
in 88 even though it may look like the politically smart thing to do 
now. But they need something--some new event or commission or 
compromise to point to as their "contribution to wisdom."
         
All this is pretty far afield from your original point concerning John 
Tower's  departure. I suppose this has been a long way of saying 
that it seems to me that the hardest work is here in Washington and 
you will need all the horses you can find to overcome the 
congresional tide running in favor of cutting the feet out of from 
under the guys in Geneva. I guess I think I could be more help here-
-or stated anopther way; if the job isn't done here, it won't make 
much difference who is in Geneva.

I am flattered that you would think of me John. But I suppose in my 
heart believe that assuming we get the initiative back from the 
congress (and I honestly believe it is feasible to do so) that you 
might want to try something differennt on arms control anyway. And 
that would be to establish the private channel with Paul Nitze or 
someone else tasked to do the negotiating.
         
It is kind of you to think of me but I honestly believe there are solid 
people who would do it and would keep up the image of a 
prestigious delegation who are probably better than I am. 
         
A different approach would be just to have Ron Lehman move up to 
fill Tower's shoes. You would take some knocks from those who 
wouldn't think his tickets are good enough--even though 
intellectually they are. Other candidates might include Sy Weiss, 
Johnny Foster, Johnny Vogt, Tom Hayward, John Lehman or Rick 
Burt or even Richard Perle.
         
As a final footnote, it looks from the outside as if Regan is charting 
some very dangerous courses in congresional relations. Today's 
throwing down of the gauntlet on the Contra issue seems to me 
very shortsighted. I may be wrong--maybe it is Pat Buchanan--he 
likes to go over the cliff with flags flying--but it doesn't matter who is 
doing it. It will alienate the few friends we have among Democrats 
who are going to be key on the issue in the House.
         
Sorry to be so verbose. The record of accomplishment is terrific. My 
kibbitzing is only out of concern for what I see Don doing to lay a 
groundwork for disaster in the future. If I can help, please just holler.

NOTE FROM: Howard Teicher
SUBJECT: vice president's meeting with yakub khan
the meeting went as predicted. in brief:
  - yakub summarized the soviet threat to retaliate against pak 
nuclear activities while making plain the real problem is continuing 
pak support for the afghans.
  - yakub argued that a combination of factors had led to this         
hardened soviet position: 
    o impasse at geneva over withdrawal schedule and monitoring          
mechanism
    o rabbani visit
    o khan visit
    o reports of stingers to the rebels which the soviets allegedly
      believe will fundamentally undermine their operational             
strategy
    o forthcoming visit of junejo
         
yakub stressed that pakistan will not be intimidated by these 
threats. but because of the real danger to pakistan "feels that it 
would be appropriate for the u.s. to let the soviet union know that 
any soviet or soviet-backed aggression would activate the mutual 
u.s.-pakistan security agreement. the timely expression of us 
commitment to pakistan's independence and territorial integrity 
would help deter soviet adventurism." (quoted from zia letter).
         
the vice president assured him that the u.s. found the soviet 
demarche unacceptable and pointed to our security cooperation as 
a clear manifestation of u.s. interest in the security of pakistan. 
however, he also reiterated u.s. concerns over the pak nuclear 
program.

next steps:                                              
  - hartman will be instructed to demarche the soviets regarding the 
unacceptability of their threats to pakistan.                   
  - a parallel demarche will be made here, as well as on the margins 
of murphy/ross talks in stockholm.                      
  - a reply for presidential signature is being drafted which would      
inform zia of our actions, stress our support for pakistan, but 
reiterate our concerns over their nuclear program.                          
the key question in my mind is whether the soviets are genuinely 
considering major military action against pakistan. steve and arnie 
think the soviets are threatening the paks in an effort to wrest 
concessions on the withdrawal and related questions while 
simultaneously exacerbating the tensions in indo-pak relations. 
while this is certainly true, at a minimum, i think the odds of a major 
soviet escalation against the paks is increasingly likely, both for the 
local political-military reasons as well as the global value of soviet 
military action against an american ally. moscow surely recognizes 
the dilemma we would face due to the political-operational 
difficulties associated with projecting american power to pakistan 
along with the policy conundrum created by the [Two and half lines

<H2>magical books, living forever</H2>

<B>by nicholas a. basbanes</B><br>
<SUB>Art from Colin Thompson's <I>How to Live Forever</I><P></SUB><P></P>


<blockquote><br>

 Anything is possible through the magic of books. Two new releases celebrate the libraries of the world in two very different ways, one through a fanciful leap of the
imagination, the other through a concise presentation of facts.<P>


<IMG SRC="magic.jpg" WIDTH=158 HEIGHT=220 ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=15>
In <I><B>How to Live Forever</B> </I>(Knopf, $17, all ages), the noted British author and illustrator Colin Thompson poses a question that has been pondered at some point by everyone, and gives it an unexpected twist in a story that will charm adults as
much as it will beguile young readers. The setting is an old library with a thousand rooms, a building that is quiet and sedate by day, but vibrant and alive at night. For two years, a character named Peter leaves his "home" within the pages of a book called "Quinces," and searches for a missing book he believes will give him the answer to eternal life. The wisdom he gains--and the decision he makes - can be summarized with a single adage: "To live forever is to not live at all."   <P>

<I>  <B> The Inside-Outside Book of Libraries</B></I> (Dutton, $15.99, Ages 5-10), the latest in a series of  "inside-outside" books by artist Roxie Munro and writer Julie Cummins, presents the wide diversity of American libraries, and the people they
serve. The 650 residents of Ocracoke Island off the coast of North Carolina, for instance, have a tiny one-room clapboard building to house a modest collection of books; the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., adds to its vast holdings of more
than 20 million books at the rate of 10 items a minute. A nice touch here is the page of braille, a subtle reminder that books, indeed, are for everyone.<P>

    Two stories that have achieved folklore status, one over a period of centuries, the other in the space of a few brief decades, have been given fresh new tellings, with fresh new illustrations.<P>

    In <I><B>Robin of Sherwood</B></I> (Harcourt Brace, $22, all ages), Michael Morpurgo, the respected author of more than 40  books for children, teams up with the noted artist Michael Foreman to give a new vision to a traditional legend. In this version, a 12-year-old boy ventures outside his home after a fierce storm to discover an ancient tree uprooted, revealing a huge crater in the ground and a human skull. With echoes of
Dorothy and Toto going off to Oz, the boy is whisked back several hundred years and drawn into an adventure involving Robin, Marion (now his wife), Friar Tuck, the evil Sheriff of Nottingham, and a band of Sherwood Forest inhabitants known as the Outcasts. The result is a rollicking story that is both familiar and new at the same time. Hint: the site where the fallen tree once grew offers a clever solution to this richly-textured journey through time.<P>

    <I><B> On Board the Titanic</B></I> (Hyperion, $16.95 Ages 9- 11), by writer Shelley Tanaka and Ken Marschall, a special effects artist for the film industry whose real-life paintings have been featured in<I> National Geographic</I> and on the cover of <I>Time</I> magazine (and on the cover of <A HREF="http://www.georgejr.com">george jr.</A>). Here, they present an "I Was There" account of one of the 20th century's most haunting disasters from the viewpoint of Jack Thayer, a 17-year-old survivor of the sinking whose belief that the ill-fated liner broke in two on the surface before going down was validated 73 years later when the wreck was discovered by Dr. Robert Ballard in two large sections on the ocean floor.<P>
 Hundreds of details are included in the text, along with many photographs. But it is Marschall's extraordinary paintings that will linger long after the covers are closed.

 What's the correct way to behave with a house full of plumbers and

<font size=+3>a.</font> 
 It depends on whether you are one of them, or they happen to be working 
in
your house.  If the former is the case, and the homeowner is nowhere to 
be seen,
just go ahead and do everything your mother taught you never to do in 
someone
else's home.  Property damage, not to mention general disgustingness, 
should
concern you not in the least.  The work you are doing is most likely so 
mysterious and
important to the homeowners that they will not only put up with your 
behavior,
but will pay you large sums of money to ruin their home.  If you are the 
homeowner
who is thinking about having these people carry on in your house, I 
suggest
you first rent the movie<I> The Plumber</I> (1980),  by Peter Weir, and 
realize
that it is a documentary.

underpants in my drawer, and a
respect for the passage of time.<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+3>q.</font> 
 How do I get my husband off the computer?<BR>

<font size=+3>a.</font> Do you love him?  Let him be who he is.  Too many 
a person reacts in
jealousy to his or her mate's interests.  Remember, you may be partners, 
but you are
also still individuals with individual wants and needs.  Not the least of 
which is
just to have the time to do silly (or enriching) things without guilt.  
And
besides, people have varying degrees of tolerance for the company of 
another.  So
unless this behavior is part of a bigger problem (i.e., he's shirking 
familial or
marital responsibilities), leave him alone.  And do some things for 
yourself to
boost your own self-esteem.<P>
</P>
<font size=+3>q.</font>
I'm stuck at my desk all day working, except for those hurried trips
to the company basement to buy processed food. What would you take to
work in a lunch bag if you were me?<BR>

<font size=+3>a.</font> 
 A brain.  Whether you pack your lunch or not, you do no favors to 
yourself
or your employer by habitually working through your lunch hour.  You  
NEED to
get away from your desk for an extended break in the middle of the day.  
Life is
too short for this nonsense.  And that's what it is.  Your work, not to 
mention
your soul, will benefit from a mid-day change of venue.<br>
<br>
<font size=+3>q.</font>


Do you dress in that skin-color system, i.e., according to whether you
are a fall, summer, spring or winter? And why do people do it?<br>

<font size=+3>a.</font> 

I've always been fascinated by color theory and how we perceive color. 
Did you know that cats see the world bichromatically?  This allows them 
to spot
small movement (like prey, or the fringe on your silk scarf) at a 
distance.  The
perception of too many colors apparently clutters the visual field.  
Humans filter
the visual world through two colors, red and green, which the brain then
interprets as being three distinct colors.  Wow.  And then there's the 
work of Chevreul,
Rood, Delaunay and Kandinsky.  Really cool stuff.  As far as dressing, I 
like to
wear things that I like.

<blockquote>
        It reads as if it were a seasonal NASDAQ report:<P>


      <LI>  "Rustic snow scenes (especially doorways) held their own, 
remained
about 15% of total."

       <LI> "Ships and galleons dropped from 10% to 3%."

      <LI>  "Stage coaches dropped from 10% to 5%; Scotties from 9% to 
1/2%."

       <LI> "Santa Claus figures rose from 2% to 4%."

     <LI>   "Wise men and camels rose from 3% to 6%."

      <LI>  "Deer, of the Bambi type, almost displaced traditional 
reindeer at 10%."

       <LI> "Holly and poinsettia and mistletoe held their own, about 9%;
Victorian scenes (including Dickens) ditto, about 5%."

     <LI>   "Drinking scenes, clowns and mistletoe vanished."

    <LI>    "Stables and mangers rose from 1% to 4%."

       <LI> "Angels and cherubs rose from 2% to 7%."

      <LI>  "Yule logs held firm at 2%."

       <LI> "New motifs, e.g. skiing, 2%"

     <LI>   "Evergreens, pine cones, and trees, firm at 2%."<P>



        Writer Christopher Morley's <B>Analysis of Christmas Cards 1942 
(as
compared with previous analysis made in 1935)</B> is a reportage of 
inspired
absurdity and brilliance, surely compiled during the frightening bleak
January boredom of the post-holiday season.<P>

        Yet, not to let his findings languish without result, Morley
continued his Yule-time ratiocination of card themes in 1948 and penciled
in an update.  He records that snow scenes stayed high as did designs of
stars and candles, churches in deep snow, holly and poinsettia, angels and
cherubs, waits, carols, and churchbells.  Yule logs, monks and medieval
scenes disappear, as do ships and galleons, stables and mangers, drinking
scenes, clowns, and mistletoe.  Not surprisingly, the post-World War II
baby boom is reflected with "family photos, scenes, or persons (especially
babies)" as the new leader logging in at 16 cards.<P>

        Morley noted other new categories for 1948:<P>

       <LI> "Text only with illustration" (10 cards)
        <LI>"Madonna & child" (3 cards)
       <LI> "Cooking or drinking recipes" (1 card)
       <LI> "Modernist design" (1 card)
     <LI>   "Puppies or kittens" (1 card)
       <LI> "Sherlock Holmes" (1 card)
     <LI>   "Historic buildings or paintings" (5 cards)
       <LI> "Noel mentioned" (2 cards)<P>


        During his lifetime (1890-1957), Morley was one of America's most
popular novelists, essayists, and poets.  Yet while his first novel,
Parnassus on Wheels, was published in 1917 and remains in print today,
Morley's other contributions are seldom remembered.  The terrifically wide
span of his work easily earns him the title man of letters and one
contemporary of his said that Morley "indeed loves the English language 
for
its own sake."  His witty columns for the <I>New York Evening Post</I> in 
the
1920s and for the <I>Saturday Review of Literature</I> - for which he 
wrote from
1924-1941 and which he helped found-were widely read.  Twice he edited
editions of<I> Bartlett's Familiar Quotations</I>.  In a satirically 
self-written
obituary Morley submitted to the reference dictionary, <I>Twentieth 
Century</I><I>
Authors</I>, he wrote "Morley was probably as much puzzled or troubled by
himself as some of his readers were by him.  His best loved private
associations were with people devoid of conventional culture, such as
booksellers, shipmasters, traveling salesman, headwaiters, and occasional
professors of English literature."<P>

        In Texas our winters lack the insensate cold and attenuated
darkness as those of Morley's New York.  But we suffer no less from the
protracted and numbing boredom of the post-holiday period, enhanced by the
unromantic sight of leftover holiday yard displays in sunny, snowless
settings.  And so with Christmas tree recycling day upon us in
eco-conscious Austin, I add new rubrics for the continuation of Morley's
analysis from my own stack of cards received this year:<P>


        <LI> An unkindly amount of angels.
        <LI>Endangered species, especially the young of endangered 
species.
        <LI>  Endangered natural environments (printed, de rigeur, on 100%
post-consumer recycled paper).
        <LI> Cartoon characters (especially Dilbert and Far Side).
        <LI>  Disease-related causes:  various and assorted cancers, AIDS,
Alzheimer's, MS, dyslexia, etc.
        <LI> Winter Solstice, New Year's, Kwanzaa, Women's Empowerment, 
and
other events that are, foremost, Not Christmas.
        <LI> Admonitions to Peace on Earth, World Peace, One World, World
Unity, Children of the World, People of the World, Animals of the World,
etc.
        <LI> Anthropomorphized animals (especially cats) engaged in 
holiday
activities (tree-trimming, caroling, etc.) or dressed as holiday
characters.
        <LI>  Non-anthropomorphized animals (again, especially cats) 
decorated
with holiday trimmings or in holiday settings.
        <LI> Cards made by children in distress or under life-threatening
conditions (hungry children in large urban areas of the United States;
children in war-torn Bosnia; blind or hair-lipped children in missionary
schools in Central America, etc.).
        <LI> Cards made by anyone who suffers from compromised 
circumstances
or cards made and sold on their behalf (hungry adults in large urban areas
of the United States, people with physical or mental impairments, etc.).
        <LI> Designs created by dead artists-notably Andy Warhol and Keith
Haring-who nevertheless continually produce new holiday images each year.
        <LI> Images by famous artists and/or architects (in particular
Georgia O'Keefe, Frank Lloyd Wright, and any of the Impressionists) not
originally created to be holiday-like, but, through some tenuous visual
association (snow, use of red and green, images of stars, etc.), are now
considered in the spirit of the season.<P>


        I admit my own (snobbish) proclivity to sending cards from the
latter two categories.  However this year, after contemplating the pros 
and
cons of sending holiday email messages instead of actual cards or perhaps
even setting up a Christmas card web site to which I could then direct
everybody, I bucked my routine by sending old Mexican Christmas postcards
in clear envelopes which I then stuffed with glitter.  Most of the cards,
as I understand from my list of recipients, never made it through the U.S.
postal system.<P>

        Perhaps this proposes a new motif of sorts for the index:  cards
sent but never received.  And that leaves the possibilities for
message-writing enticingly endless.<P>

<H4> letter from key west:</H4>

<H2>the great train robbery</H2>
<blockquote>
<br>
<B>by patrick lennon</B><P>
<P>


     

     The rude buzz-saw shriek of a power mower roused J.C.

Terwilliger from sleep.  He struggled to his feet and glared at

the greens-keeper who waved a friendly hello and continued mowing

the sixth green at the Key West Golf Club.<P>


     Although J.C.'s address had an exclusive view, he was a bum.

He and Luke, a large black man, shared the protective canopy of a

gumbo-limbo tree in a thicket that separated the golf club from

U.S. 1.<P>


     J.C.'s head hammered with a hangover from cheap wine.  The

wine had helped him fall asleep without caring why he lived under

a tree.  He thought it ironic that his former home at Oak Hill

Country Club in Rochester, New York also had a golf course view.<P>


     He fingered his scraggly beard and struggled to recall the

conversation with Luke before he fell asleep.  It had been

something about outlaws.<P>


     "Jesse James,"  he said.<P>


     "Jesse James?"  Luke grunted.  He peeled the matted army

blanket off his ponderous body and rubbed sleep from his blood-

shot, brown eyes.<P>


     "I told you Jesse James was a thief and a racist," Luke

said.<P>


               "Perhaps, but  he believed in the free enterprise system.  A

          man ahead of his time.  A venture capitalist."<P>


               "Capitalist?"  Luke asked, stretching, "Henry Ford was a

          capitalist.  Jesse James was a fuckin train robber."<P>


               "True, but he didn't get any government hand-outs.  He

          depended on his own talents."<P>


               "In his day, robbin trains wasn't much of a talent.  All it

          took was a big gun, a fast horse, and a little nerve."<P>


               "That's what we should do,"  J.C. said.<P>


               "What you talkin 'bout?"<P>


               "Rob a train."<P>


               "How are we goin to rob a train in Key West?"  Luke snorted,

          scratching his belly.<P>


               "The Conch Train."<P>



               "Man, you are crazy."<P>


               "Tourists carry lots of cash.  They all have watches,

          jewelry, and cameras.  The Japanese usually have two or three

          cameras looped around their necks.  We could hock them at the

          pawn shop.  What we need is a plan."<P>


               "What we need is breakfast,"  Luke said.<P>


               "Food?"  J.C. asked.  "At a time like this, you think of

          food?"<P>


               "We can't rob a train on an empty stomach,"  Luke said.<P>


               "All right, how do you propose to pay for breakfast?"<P>


               Luke searched his pockets.  He removed his huge hands from

          his Levi's and produced three quarters.<P>




               "Remember, I bought the wine last night."  "Seventy-five

          cents.  How much you got?"<P>


               J.C. stuffed his hands into his pockets and produced five

          quarters, a dime, and twelve pennies.  "A dollar forty-seven."

               "O.K. I'll get us a croissant with egg and ham and two cups

          of coffee."<P>


               "Should I go with you?"<P>


               "Do you think I'd eat your share?"  Luke asked.<P>


               "Of course not, I trust you.  I'll work on the plan while

          you're gone."<P>


               "Whatever,"  Luke said, shaking his head, as he walked

          toward U.S. 1.<P>


               J.C. removed a water stained, yellow tablet and a Conch

          Train promotional brochure from his kit.  He chewed a point on a

          number two pencil stub and began writing.<P>


               When Luke returned with the coffee and croissant, J.C. had

          the plan nearly completed.  Luke split the croissant and passed

          half to J.C. along with a cup of coffee.  J.C., preoccupied with

          his plan, placed the food on the ground and continued writing.<P>


               "The get-a-way is critical,"  J.C. said.  "Jesse James

          always had a fast horse.  We'll need fast horses."<P>


               "Where the hell are you goin to find horses in Key West?

          I've lived here five years and never seen one horse.  We can't

          get no horses,"  Luke said.

               "You mean any horses."<P>



               "Any horses?  No horses?  We still can't find a fuckin horse

          in Key West!"  Luke bellowed, inhaling part of his ham and egg

          croissant.<P>


               "We need a substitute . . . any suggestions?"<P>


               Luke thought while he chewed his croissant.  He swallowed,

          sipped coffee, and said,  "Bikes!"<P>


               "Luke, you're a genius.  Bicycles are the answer.  Of

          course, they're not as dependable or as faithful as a spirited

          steed, but we must be flexible and adapt to local conditions."

               "O.K., so we get a couple of bikes.  Then what?"<P>


               "I've analyzed the Conch Train's route,"  J.C. said,

          pointing to a map inside the brochure.  "They turn south from

          Green Street onto Ann Street and stop a few moments so the

          engineer can describe the Curry Mansion.  It's a perfect place

          for an ambush.  That's where we strike."<P>


               "Strike?"<P>


               "Yes.  You'll block the way and wave a large gun at the

          engineer.  I'll start at the rear of the train and relieve the

          tourists of their wallets, purses, and cameras.  I'll put

          everything in a plastic garbage bag.  When I've finished

          collecting the loot, you'll order the engineer to continue toward

          Duval Street.  We'll get on our bicycles and make our get-a-way.

          It's simple and straight forward, like any good business plan."<P>


               "Except one thing,"  Luke said.<P>


               "What?"<P>


               "Where are we goin get bikes?"<P>



               "I'm responsible for planning.  You're in charge of

          logistics."<P>


               "Logistics?"  Luke thought a moment, and said, "Oh, you want

          me to steal the bikes?"<P>


               "That's logistics."<P>


               "What about the gun?"<P>


               Both men sampled their croissants.  J.C. wiped his mouth

          with a napkin, and said, "We'll need a gun.  A large gun.  A gun

          that will intimidate the tourists."<P>


               "Is that part of logistics?"  Luke asked.<P>


               "Yes, and the garbage bag."<P>


               "I got all the work,"  Luke said.<P>


               "I specialized in planning, before my unfortunate

          bankruptcy."<P>


               "If you're a planner, I'm a rocket scientist."  Luke

          countered.<P>


               "Can you get the bicycles, gun, and garbage bag?"<P>


               "I'm not sure about the gun, but I can latch onto a couple

          of bikes and a garbage bag."<P>


               "O.K., when you've assembled the resources, we'll put my

          plan into action.  Of course, you'll need a plan to appropriate

          the bicycles."<P>


               "I don't need no plan to get bikes in Key West,"  Luke said.<P>


               "You don't need any plan to get bicycles,"  J.C. corrected.<P>


               "That's what I said."<P>


               When they finished eating, Luke walked across Cow Key

          Channel bridge to the parking lot of a motel.  He located several


          bicycles haphazardly parked near the manager's office but out of

          view.  Only a few had locks on them.  He thought a pair of

          mountain bikes with knobby tires would be perfect.  He selected

          two that had baskets and casually walked up to them.  Trying not

          to look suspicious, he picked one up by the seat, balanced it

          across the handlebars of another, saddled onto the bike, and

          weaved out of the parking lot.<P>


               J.C. broke into a broad grin when he saw Luke.  "My father

          used to say the early bird gets the worm.  I see you've been

          successful."<P>


               "Do you know how to ride a bike?"  Luke asked.<P>


               "Of course."<P>


               "Let me see,"  Luke challenged.<P>


               J.C. tucked his right trouser cuff into his sock, hefted his

          leg over the seat, pedaled five feet, hit an exposed root on the

          Gumbo-Limbo tree, and tumbled to the ground.<P>


               Luke's belly jiggled as he laughed.  "Maybe your father

          should have got you a bike instead of a worm."  Luke sneered.<P>


               "I'm a little out of practice.  By the time you locate the

          gun and garbage bag, I'll be ready for the Tour de France."<P>


               "The gun is a problem,"  Luke said, his face growing solemn

          and his voice deepening to a whisper.  "I don't like guns."    He

          removed a knife from his back pocket and flipped open the switch

          blade.  "This was standard issue in my neighborhood."<P>


               "People run from knives.  They don't run from guns.  A gun

          has staying power."<P>


               "Those old white ladies with blue hair ain't goin to run.

          Besides, most of their husbands can't stand up without their

          walkers.  A knife will do just fine."<P>


               "No, we'll need a gun,"  J.C. said.<P>


               "Then you get the gun.  I've done all I'm goin to."<P>


               The two men sat silently for a minute.  Luke drew stick men

          in the sandy soil with a twig, nibbled on his sandwich, and

          avoided eye contact with J.C.<P>


               "O.K., I'll get the gun,"  J.C. said.  "I have a plan."<P>


               "When?"<P>


               Today,"  J.C. replied.  "Tomorrow, we rob the Conch Train."<P>


               "I'm goin to the Sunset diner,"  Luke said.  "They pay five

          dollars and lunch if I wash the breakfast dishes.  I'll see you

          later.  Oh, you want me to buy some wine?"<P>


               J.C. nodded yes and leaned his bike against the tree.  After

          Luke blended into morning traffic on U.S. 1, J.C. rummaged

          through his kit, removed a can of Vienna sausages and opened it.

          As he ate, he watched the sun slowly climb over Stock Island.

          "KMart doesn't open until nine o'clock."<P>


               At two in the afternoon, Luke returned with a gallon of Mad

          Dog 20-20 and a plastic bag filled with sandwiches.  "I must have

          done a good job.  The manager gave me these," he said, hefting

          the bag in front of J.C.<P>


               "Good . . . my day was equally successful."<P>


               "You got a gun?"  Luke asked.<P>


               "Yes."<P>


               "I don't believe it."<P>



               J.C. belched, as he leaned over and opened his kit.  He

          produced a revolver, and a box of plastic trash bags.<P>


               "Jesus Christ!"  Luke said.  "Where did you get it?"<P>


               "KMart."<P>


               "KMart?  A toy gun.  You got a toy gun?"<P>


               "It'll be just as effective as a real gun.  We have the

          element of surprise.  One look at you waving a gun will convince

          them we're desperate.  You'd be surprised what white people will

          do when a black man points a large gun at them."<P>


               "No different with a knife,"  Luke said.<P>


               Later that evening, they sat in quivering shafts of

          moonlight, filtering through the leaves of the Gumbo-Limbo tree.

          Luke sipped wine from a paper cup and asked,  "Do you think this

          is a good idea?  I'm not sure I want to go through with this."<P>


               "It won't fail,"  J.C. said.  "Have confidence in my plan."<P>


               "Man, you ever done hard time?"<P>


               "You mean prison?"  J.C. asked.<P>


               "Yeah."<P>


               "No."<P>


               "Sometimes things don't go like they's planned," Luke said.<P>


               "Only if it's a defective plan,"  J.C. said.  "Quit worrying

          and pass the wine."<P>


               At nine a.m., they biked across Cow Key Channel bridge, then

          followed the sidewalk along Roosevelt Boulevard until they came

          to Palm Avenue.  J.C., panting heavily, walked his bicycle to the

          top of the Garrison Bight Bridge on Palm Avenue, but coasted down

          the other side.<P>



               With Luke leading the way, they turned right on Grinnel

          Street and left on Caroline Street, continuing to Ann Street.

          They parked their bicycles on the sidewalk on the east side of

          the Curry Mansion.<P>


               "We'll wait until we see a full train before we execute the

          plan,"  J.C. said, catching his breath and mopping his forehead

          with a red calico bandana.<P>


               They stared north on Ann Street, and a few minutes later, a

          Conch Train rounded the Old City Hall, turning onto Ann Street.<P>


               "Looks full,"  Luke said.<P>


               J.C. studied the coaches.  "No, there's too many empty

          seats."<P>


               Sweat streamed from J.C.'s pink forehead.<P>


               "How you feel?"  Luke asked.<P>


               "I'm a little out of sorts,"  J.C. said.  "I'll be all

          right."<P>


               "Your face is redder than your bandana."<P>


               "I need a few minutes."<P>


               Another Conch Train turned on to Ann Street.  Only a few

          seats were empty.<P>


               "What about this one?"  Luke asked.<P>


               "No, let's wait,"  J.C. said.  "I'll move down the street.

          If I think the next train has enough passengers, I'll signal you

          with a "thumbs-up" sign.  Don't use our real names."<P>


               "What do you want me to call you?"  Luke asked.<P>


               "Jesse."<P>


               "Am I Frank?"<P>


               "Yes.  Did you know that was the name of Jesse's brother?"

          J.C. asked.<P>


               "Listen, Jesse, I didn't just fall off the back of a turnip

          truck."<P>


               J.C. walked north on Ann Street.  He sat on the concrete

          base of the fence surrounding the Curry Mansion, breathing

          heavily and mopping his forehead.<P>


               A Conch Train rounded Old City Hall with every seat filled.

          J.C. signaled Luke.  Luke gripped the handle of the toy gun

          stuffed in his waistband.<P>


               When the train's engine braked at Caroline Street, the

          engineer began his canned presentation of the historical

          significance of the Curry Mansion.  Luke approached the

          engineer's cab.  Suddenly there was a loud scream.  All the

          passengers on the train focused on J.C., facedown on the sidewalk

          near the last passenger car.<P>


               "Hey,"  a man with a New Jersey accent yelled from the last

          passenger car, "I think he's having a heart attack or something."<P>


               "I'm a retired nurse's aide,"  a woman with blue hair and an

          authoritative voice said, climbing down from her seat.  "I'll

          examine him."<P>


               Luke glanced at J.C., sprawled on the ground.<P>


               "Outta that seat twerp,"  Luke ordered the engineer.  The

          young man noticed the gun Luke gripped in his waistband, bounded

          out of the cab, and raced toward Duval Street.<P>


               "Load him on the train,"  yelled Luke.<P>


               As three men manhandled J.C. into the last car, Luke tossed

          the toy gun into the front yard of the Curry Mansion.  When

          everyone reboarded the train, Luke mounted the cab.  After

          scrutinizing the controls for a few seconds, he shifted the

          transmission into gear, pushed the accelerator to the floor, and

          turned left on Caroline Street.<P>


               The Conch Train was going thirty miles an hour when it ran

          the red light at Simonton Street.  As it whizzed through the

          intersection of Elizabeth and Caroline Streets, the speedometer

          registered fifty miles per hour.  At Grinnel Street, Luke braked,

          turned south, and nearly tipped over the cars.  Passengers

          screamed and pedestrians gawked at the fleeting train.  At Eaton

          Street, he turned left.<P>


               The passengers, clinging to their seats, shrieked and

          groaned as Luke threaded through traffic, turning into Trumbo

          Point and Peary Court.<P>


               When he reached Roosevelt Boulevard and turned left, Luke

          discovered the bell and rang it with urgency.  As he maneuvered

          down the center of Roosevelt Boulevard, cars veered left and

          right avoiding the speeding train.<P>


               A Key West Police car, with bubble gum lights flashing,

          pulled up next to Luke.  The officer riding in the passenger seat

          yelled at Luke, "What's going on?"<P>


               "A passenger's dying,"  Luke said.  "I'm takin him to the

          hospital."<P>


               "Follow us,"  the policeman said.<P>



               The siren screeched, tires squealed, and the police car sped

          ahead of the train.<P>


               The policeman radioed another patrolman who cleared traffic

          at the turn to Stock Island.  Following the police car, Luke

          swerved onto Junior College Road and braked at the emergency room

          entrance of Lower Keys Hospital.<P>


               Waiting under the portico, nurses and doctors, alerted by

          the police, sprang into action.  They clamped an oxygen mask on

          J.C. and loaded him onto a gurney.  The policemen followed J.C.'s

          gurney into the Emergency Room lobby.  The passengers disembarked

          the train and gathered around the engine.<P>


               "That was quite a job of driving," a passenger said to Luke.

          "If he lives, you saved his life, but you scared hell out of me."<P>


               "That's for sure,"  another passenger said.<P>


               "I've not had so much excitement in years,"  a matronly lady

          in plaid shorts and a bulging halter said.<P>


               "What happened to the engineer?"  A passenger asked.<P>


               "He panicked,"  Luke said.<P>


               "You deserve a reward,"  a man leaning on a walker said.

          "I've never seen such driving skill."<P>


               "Yeah,"  passengers echoed.  "You're a hero."<P>


               "Let's take up a collection,"  the matronly lady said.<P>


               A rotund man with a cherry red face passed his floppy straw

          hat among the passengers.  "O.K. I don't want to hear any coins

          tinkle in my hat."<P>


               The next afternoon, Luke stopped at the information counter

          of the hospital and asked a blue haired lady in a pink smock


          which room Jasper C. Terwilliger occupied.  She spun the rack and

          searched the admission cards.<P>


               "Sorry, we don't have a Mr. Terwilliger."<P>


               "What about James, Jesse James?"<P>


               "Yes, Mr. James has just been moved from the Coronary Care

          Unit to Room 423.  His diagnosis is an acute gallbladder."<P>


               "What's his condition?"<P>


               "It says good," she said, suspiciously looking over her

          half-eye glasses at Luke.<P>


               "I'd like to see him."<P>


               "Sorry, only relatives."<P>


               "I'm his brother, Frank."<P>


               "I've heard of you and your brother."  She handed him a

          pass.<P>


               "Luke!"  J.C. said, when Luke entered the room.  "What

          happened?"<P>


               "I'll explain it to you later.  How you feel?"<P>


               "Tip-top."<P>


               "Are you up to a dinner at the Pier House?"<P>


               "I take it our venture was successful?"<P>


               "Everythin worked out,"  Luke said.<P>


             J.C. beamed. "Just like I told you, we needed a plan."  <P>

<H3>Techies/White House E-mail link</H3>
<blockquote>
The White House refused to provide any of the e-mail in electronic
form. Rather, White House and other government staff printed out
the specific e-mail messages targetted by the National Security
Archive's Freedom of Information Act requests, then reviewed the
printouts for classified information and privacy issues before
releasing them in hard copy form.
<P>
Ian Stevenson then employed a Hewlett Packard ScanJet IIc/ADF
scanner, together with CAERE optical character recognition
software, to digitize the large stack of White House printouts
selected for this disk. The typographical errors, run-on
sentences, bad grammar, colloquial language and other questionable
matters found here are all exactly as they appear in the originals
-- nothing was corrected or bowdlerized for this disk. The layouts
are as close to the originals as humanly possible, including the
classification markings.

<H3>White House E-mail  CHRONOLOGY</H3>
<blockquote>


<B>1982</B> - The National Security Council (NSC) staff at the White House acquires a prototype electronic mail system, from IBM, called the Professional Office
System (PROFs).
<P>
<B>April 1985 </B>- The PROFs e-mail system becomes fully operational within the NSC,
including not only the full staff, but also home terminals for the National
Security Adviser, Robert "Bud" McFarlane, and his deputy, Admiral John M.
Poindexter.
<P>
<B>december 1986</B> - The remainder of the White House comes on line with
electronic mail, at first with the PROFs system, and later (by the end of the 1980s) through a variety of systems including VAX A-1 ("All in One"), and ccmail.
<P>
<B>december 22-25, 1986</B> - John Poindexter and Oliver North electronically shred
more than 5000 e-mail notes in the memory banks of their computer systems, as the
Iran-contra scandal breaks.
<P>
<B>december 28, 1986</B> - Career staff at the White House Communications Agency
order the december backup tapes of the e-mail system to be saved instead of recycled as usual. Subsequently, investigators from the FBI and the Tower Commission use
the backup takes to reconstruct the Iran-contra scandal.
<P>
 - The Tower Commission issues its report on Iran-contra,
reprinting hundreds of PROFs notes exchanged by McFarlane, Poindexter and
North.
<P>
<B>January 19, 1989</B> - On the last day of the Reagan presidency, the National
Security Archive files a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests
together with a lawsuit against President Ronald Reagan, to prevent the imminent
erasure of the White House electronic mail backup tapes. At 6:10 pm, on the eve
of George Bush's inauguration, U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker issues a
Temporary Restraining Order, prohibiting the destruction of the backup tapes to
the PROFs system.
<P>
<B>September 15, 1989</B> - U.S. District Judge Charles B. Richey rules that the
National Security Archive and its co-plaintiffs, including the American
Historical Association (AHA) and the American Library Association (ALA), have
standing to sue President Bush, in order to force him to comply with the
retention requirements of various records acts which potentially cover the White
House e-mail.
<P>
<B>January 25, 1991</B> - After a year-and-a-half of legal procedural wrangling, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upholds Judge Richey's
ruling on standing, denying the Bush administration's attempts to have the case
dismissed.
<P>
<B>december 20, 1992</B> - On request from the plaintiffs, Judge Richey adds the White House e-mail from the lame-duck Bush administration to the case, issuing a
restraining order preventing the Bush White House from destroying its own
backup computer records.
<P>
<B>January 6, 1993</B> - Judge Richey rules that computer tapes containing copies of
e-mail messages by Reagan and Bush White House staff must be preserved like
other government records, because the electronic versions are not simply duplicates of
paper printouts, but contain additional information beyond the paper copies.
<P>
<B>January 11 and 14, 1993</B> - Judge Richey issues specific court orders requiring
that the Bush White House preserve its computer records. In press interviews,
Judge Richey says that despite his orders, he believes that the Bush
administration is planning to destroy its e-mail files.
<P>
<B>January 15, 1993</B> - In an expedited emergency ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit upholds and modifies the rulings by Judge
Richey, holding that government officials could erase White House and NSC
computer files, as long as they preserved, on backup tapes, identical copies of
what was being erased.
<P>
<B>January 19, 1993</B> - President Bush signs a secret agreement with Don Wilson,
head of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), purporting to
grant Bush exclusive legal control over the e-mail tapes of his administration. 
Working through the night, a staff team from NARA takes custody of thousands
of tapes and disk drives, hurriedly removing them from White House offices to
prevent incoming Clinton appointees from gaining access to them.
<P>
<B>February 16, 1993</B> - NARA career staff who managed the transfer describe in an internal memo how the so-called "midnight ride" had violated NARA's own rules
for records transfers and how several sets of tapes ordered preserved by Judge Richey
had been lost, erased or damaged.
<P>
<B>May 22, 1993 </B>- Judge Richey cites the Clinton White House and the acting
Archivist of the United States for contempt of court for failing to carry out his
order to issue new and appropriate guidelines for the preservation of the
computer records of the Reagan, Bush and Clinton White House staff.
<P>
<B>August 13, 1993</B> - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
vacates Judge Richey's contempt orders but upholds his overall decision that the
Federal Records Act (FRA) requires that complete electronic copies of e-mail
messages be preserved by the White House, and by extension, government
agencies in general. The appeals court remands the case to Judge Richey to decide the
issue of the dividing line between "agency" records covered by the FRA and
presidential records covered by the Presidential Records Act.
<P>
<B>March 25, 1994</B> - In a brief filed in federal court, the Clinton administration
declares that the National Security Council is not an agency, and should be
accorded the protection from public scrutiny given to the President's personal
advisers. This argument attempts to remove the Clinton administration's White
House e-mail from the reach of FOIA requests and the FRA, arguing that all its
documents are subject only to the Presidential Records Act (PRA) and therefore
not to court oversight.
<P>
<B>December 13, 1994</B> - The e-mail plaintiffs file suit against the Acting Archivist
of the United States to void the Bush-Wilson agreement, in American Historical
Association et. al. v. Peterson.
<P>
<B>February 15, 1995</B> - Judge Richey rejects the Clinton administration's arguments about the NSC's status as "arbitrary and capricious... contrary to history, past practice and the law," and declares that the National Security Council is an
agency. The government subsequently appeals the decision, and the plaintiffs
cross-appeal against a portion of Richey's ruling that opens a loophole for
senior NSC staff giving advice to the President.
<P>
<B>February 27, 1995</B> - In a separate opinion in the lawsuit over the Bush-Wilson
agreement, Judge Richey declares the agreement "null and void," writing that "No
one, not even a President, is above the law." The New York Times subsequently
editorializes, under the headline "A Special Place in History for Mr. Bush," that
"No President has the right to corner official records in an effort to control
his place in history." (March 1, 1995, page A18)
<P>

bad priest-to-be, Tony Mendoza offers a cat-house confession, and God knows
what else.

JOYCE CAROL OATES: <BR>
Sexual Obsession & Child Abuse
<P>
Joyce Carol Oates is the author of more than 20 novels, as well as many books of poetry, criticism and essays.  Her latest, First Love: A Gothic Tale ($18), interweaving harsha realism with the macabre, has just appeared from The Ecco Press. Her previous novels include Zombie, What I Live For, and George Bellows: An American Artist and The Assignation: Stories.
<P>
First Love is illustrated by an old favorite of <b>george jr.</b>, Barry Moser. Moser has illustrated and designed nearly 200 books, including the Arion Press edition of Moby-Dick, and the University of California's version of The Divine Comedy of Dante.
<P>
His edition of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland won a National Book Award for design and illustration in 1983.<BR clear=all>
<hr width=75%>
<P>
<font size=5>q.</font> What was your inspiration for First Love?
<P>
<font size=5>a.</font> It began as more of a straight realistic story about a young girl who, with her divorced  mother, comes to live with distant relatives in upstate New York. Among the family is  a young man accused, though never convicted, of child molestation.. The family doesn't tell the girl or mother about the young man's past - and the girl becomes his victim.
<P>
For two or three years, I had this idea for a novella. I wanted to present it from the girl's point of view. In retrospect, I began to meditate on the bond that often develops between victim  and  abuser,  and First Love evolved.
<P>
<font size=5>q.</font> You describe First Love as a Gothic romance. Can you explain?
<P>
<font size=5>a.</font> Because it deals with  taboo  subjects:  a  child's  romantic yearning for a relationship with a young man; a victim's  enchantment with  and  devotion  to  an abuser. Such emotions are complicated - and they make people very uncomfortable. And the setting comes from the Gothic tradition: an isolated, forbidding house with family secrets.
<P>
<font size=5>q.</font> First Love deals with many social  themes:  child  abuse,  sexual  obsession,  psychological manipulation, broken families. . .
<P>
<font size=5>a.</font>It's hard to talk about a work of literature in that way. There's a danger of becoming reductionist. A work of literature is its language, mood atmosphere. It's not just about an issue.
<P>
<font size=5>q.</font> Your protagonist, Josie S., is an 11-year-old wise beyond her years, who, at times, seems to seek out abuse at the hands of her 25-year-old cousin, Jared Jr. What motivates her?
<P>
<font size=5>a.</font> I believe there's a strong element of masochism in most women. Josie is a young woman involved in, and fascinated by, her own degradation. She Is fascinated by the mystery  of  Jared, Jr., this imposing male. She's also motherless and fatherless, desperate for attention, willing to be exploited.  Look at members of cults, at followers of David Koresh.  People will endure much  degradation for attention, for love.
<P>
<font size=5>q.</font> Why do you say Josie is "motherless"?
<P>
<font size=5>a.</font> Josie's mother doesn't want to "play" mother, doesn't want to be a mother. She's a strong-willed woman of her own, and very narcissistic. She's not a villain, but she's not there for Josie. First Love is about that, too.
<P>
<font size=5>q.</font> First Love's real villain, Jared Jr., is studying to become a Presbyterian minister. Would you call him a religious fanatic?
<P>
<font size=5>a.</font> He is fighting the demons of his own internal disbelief. He's inherited a burden from his grandfather. Living in "the Reverend's" house, he's trying to live up to "the Reverend's" name, "the Reverend's' calling. Jared Jr. is disturbed, weak and pathetic. But there's no excuse for child abuse.
<P>
<font size=5>q.</font> First Love is set in rural, upstate New York,  which is a recurring locale in at least your  best fiction. Is the inspiration for Ransomville taken from your birthplace, Lockport, N.Y.?
<P>
<font size=5>a.</font> Ransomville is a real place, not far from where my parents live. But the real Ransomville is nothing like the fictionalized setting of First Love.

<P>
FRANCO FERRUCCI:<BR>
The Man Who Would Be God
<P>
The Italian writer Franco Ferrucci  most recently is the author of a novel disguised as autobiography, <I>The Life of God  (as Told By Himself)</I>, from the University of Chicago Press. His other books include <I>Saturn's Moon, Far Away from Home, The Poem of Desire: Poetics and Passion in Dante</I> and a study of Homer, <I>The Siege and the Return.</I>
<BR clear=all>
<hr width=75%>
<P>
<font size=5>q.</font> <I>The Life of God </I>is  the  most  widely  translated  of  your  seven  novels  and  has just appeared in English, too. How does it fit in - or does it? - with your other books?
<P>
<font size=5>a.</font> <I>The Life of God</I> has been the book of my life. Everything that I have  written rotates around this book, like planets around the sun. Maybe it is not  too  much  to  say  that  one of my best novels, <I>Saturn's  Moons</I> , has such an astronomical title because it rotates around <I>The Life of God. </I><I>Saturn's Moons</I> is only about two lovers, and they are lost  in  the  space  of  love;  such  a big space demands to be filled by some divine presence.
<P>
<font size=5>q.</font> Estrangement  - as seen there in space, the absence of things and people  -seems a recurring theme in your work.
<P>
<font size=5>a.</font> One of the premises of <I>The Life of God</I>  is that God's chief destiny seems  to  be  his original solitude. Somehow, he always feels as if  he  were  an  exile  in his  own  creation. This kind of estrangement is a constant theme in my novels, and affects all sorts of characters. My novels are typically about distance  from  home,  and  of  people  meeting  by  hazard, being lost in  the  world,  finding  themselves  stranded  and  uprooted.  This  is  the  most poetical situation I can think of, and perhaps in <I>The Life of God</I> I elevated it  to  something of a philosophic statement about the loneliness of life in the universe.
<P>
<font size=5>q.</font> Umberto Eco called  the Italian edition  "religiously enlightened  and  orthodoxically  heretical."  Do  you  think   of   yourself   as   religious?
<P>
<font size=5>a.</font> Before this book I thought of myself  as  an  atheist.  It  came  naturally  to  me.  When  my mother took me to Mass for the first time (I was five years old), the  only  feeling  that  I remember  was  one  of  wondering  disbelief.  That  wonder  only  increased   when   I   read religious treatises, but, at the same time, I felt that religion was a great opening into people's  minds and imaginations.
<P>
I never thought  of  myself  as  a  believer  until  I  found  myself  writing about God.
<P>
Maybe this was a divine trick  to  pull  me  into this kind of discourse. But of course I  had  to  imagine  a  God  whom  I could  accept,  a  God who could satisfy my rational needs, since I did not  need  him  for  any  kind  of  spiritual protection. So I said to myself, "How about a defective God?' That  would  at least account  for some of the imperfections of  human nature.  Not  to  mention the missed  trains,  the  incredible delays  in  delivering the mail,  and the fall of  the  Roman  Empire  besides.
<P>
If  these  proved  anything  at  all,  it was the imperfection of  God.  This  is  how  I  discovered  my  religiousness,  such  as  it  is.
<P>
<font size=5>q.</font> How did  your  background  as  a lit professor shape  your  "life  of God"?
<P>
<font size=5>a.</font> In the novel there is  a  chapter  about  how  Dante  composed  <I>The Divine Comedy</I>  and  God's  vain  attempts  to  get  Dante  to  change  his  mind  about  God.  I  knew  what  God  was  up against,  since I have been a Dante scholar .  Obviously,   my God  failed  in  his  attempt  to  educate  Dante,  but  not  even  the  popes  could  convince him to change his mind about anything.
<P>
<font size=5>q.</font> I don't follow  . . .
<P>
<font size=5>a.</font> I have always liked the  way  the  Greeks  used  mythology.  It  is  not  even  sure  that they believed in  it,  but  they  were  enamored  with  their  own  creations.  That  may  be why,  when I was young, I  wrote  a  study  of  Homer  and later a short book on myth in literature. Legends and fables fascinate me,  and  some  of  those  great  classics of children's literature, too, had a strong influence on <I>The Life  of  God. </I> I  also  have  a  great admiration for science, the greatest  fable  of  our  time.  In  my  novel,  God  becomes  a  good   friend of Einstein and plans his own departure with Einstein's help. I have often  thought  that  happiness  was  some  sort  of  fleeting  mathematical  state,  balanced   and  inexact, like harmony in music. Once I mentioned this  to  a  friend  of mine who was a  mathematician, and he did not contradict  me.

<P
<font size=5>q.</font> <I>The  Life of God </I>has already appeared in French, German, Dutch, Danish  and Spanish.  For  the  English  translation,  you   returned   to   the   book   and   made  revisions. Is the book now truly finished?
<P>
<font size=5>a.</font> Being the sun of my solar system as a writer, <I>The Life of God</I> is not  a  dead  star.  So  every time that I go back to it, as happened for the English version of the book, it is like touching a living thing: it reacts, it moves, it contracts. I can feel it breathing.  Yes,  I rewrote some sections of  it,  and  I  added  new  episodes--like  the  one  about  the  invention of language, or the one in which God enters Moby Dick.
<P>
I am sure that I will return to the book again,  This  book  will  not  be  finished  until I die. Don't forget that my God is an artist, guided by  inspiration rather than calculation. My attempt to write his autobiography is as close as I'll ever come to  writing my own.

VICTORIA ALEXANDER:<BR>
An American Geisha in Japan
<P>
 Former stripper Victoria N. Alexander's first novel, <br>
<i><i>Smoking Hopes</i> </i>(Permanent Press, 1996), is an <br>
almost-life story based on the author's experiences <br>
as a geisha girl in Japan. 
<P>
The New Yorker is writing her second book, also a <br>
novel, called <i>Trixie, Mad Pixie. </i>

<BR clear=all>
<hr width=75%>
<P>
<font size=5>q.</font> What gave you the idea to write about Japanese hostess clubs?
<P>
<font size=5>a.</font>   I had a girlfriend who worked in one.  She used to move around
a lot, London, New York, Tokyo, L.A..  Hostessing was a way to make a good salary easily anywhere, without any kind of commitment.  I envied her freedom.  Her clients used to pay her rent, buy her groceries, pets and jewelry, and she said she didn't have to do anything but talk to them and light their cigarettes.  Of course, I didn't believe her.
<P>
<font size=5>q.</font> What is expected of the hostesses?
<P>
<font size=5>a.</font>   Conversation and matches.  Seriously.  Hostess clubs are private social clubs.  The men bring in their clients for entertainment.  They discuss business, and flirt a little.  They drink lots of scotch.  You dance with them, slow dance, like a waltz.  They leave their business cards.  That's it.  And they give mama san anywhere from one hundred to one thousand dollars. It seemed too incredible to be true - that's why I  decided to write about it.  I was intrigued.  It seemed to me that there
would be so much room for confusion and misunderstandings in a
situation like that, especially where two such opposite types meet - Japanese business men and young "artsy" New York women, you know.
<P>
<font size=5>q.</font> Did you work in a hostess bar yourself?
<P>
<font size=5>a.</font>  Yes, in New York and in Tokyo.  I, too, was given outrageous
gifts.  I had always wondered whether my girlfriend's conscience bothered her, accepting all those gifts.  Didn't she feel guilty?  Couldn't she simply refuse them?  I discovered it wasn't so easy.
<P>
<font size=5>q.</font> Why not?
<P>
<font size=5>a.</font>  The men were persistent and very sweet.  They always said, "No
string attached."
<P>
<font size=5>q.</font> Hmm. Were there?
<P>
<font size=5>a.</font> Only heartstrings, maybe, but that was what made it tough.
<P>
<font size=5>q.</font> That's the "real life" inspiration for the novel.  Any
literary inspirations?
<P>
<font size=5>a.</font>  I started writing <i><i>Smoking Hopes</i></i> right after I read Martin Amis' <i>Money: A Suicide Note. </i> My heroine, Charlie Dean, is my
answer to Amis' John Self.  They both are representations of appetite, of licentiousness, of the overwhelming desire to be loved.
<P>
<font size=5>q.</font> Anything else?
<P>
<font size=5>a.</font>  Everything I was reading at the time; it's all in there.  <i>Waiting for Godot</i> is very important to the theme.  In place of Vladimir and Estragon I have two beautiful "tramps," Lola and Charlie, who wait for their ex-lover, Gottlieb, to return.  I was also thinking of something Nabokov once said.  He said there were several themes that would be absolutely taboo as far as American publishers were concerned.  One of them would be "The atheist who lives a happy and useful life and dies in his sleep at the age of 106."  I had that in the back of my mind as I started writing.  My novel reflects that general idea, but subversively.  In other words, I had to make it a tragedy of sorts.
<P>
<font size=5>q.</font> You posed nude for the photograph on the back cover.  Why?
<P>
<font size=5>a.</font>   It's a lovely photograph.  My husband, Neil Grayson, took it. 
It reminds me of Horst's best work.  I like nudes, don't you?  I've always liked them.  This photograph really seems to have caught my personality, much better than any portraits that I've had taken.  Besides the novel is about feminine sexuality.  And readers like to think that what they're reading is real, is true.  The photograph, the biographical information that I was a stripper and a hostess, lets them imagine that <i>Smoking Hopes</i> is somewhat autobiographical. 
<P>
<font size=5>q.</font> Which parts, if you don't mind my prying?
<P>
<font size=5>a.</font>  Charlie Dean is a small part of myself, exaggerated, so are Hiro and Lola, etc.  I think anyone can find him/herself in my characters.
<P>
<font size=5>q.</font> What's next?
<P>
<font size=5>a.</font>   My second novel is called <i>Trixie, Mad Pixie.</i>  It's about a
sweet little stripper who winds up in the tabloids.  It's a tragicomedy. 
<P>
<font size=5>q.</font> Similar, thematically, to <i>Smoking Hopes</i>.
<P>
<font size=5>a.</font>  Yes, but a different tone, more optimistic, with some of the same character types.  You see, I love girls with meretricious charms.

<H3>TONY MENDOZA: THIS IS NORMAL </H3>
I was standing in line to the confessional at the pigeon-stained Polish Catholic church in downtown Wallingford. I was worried. The only thought that cheered me was that the line was long.
<P>      
It was September, 1955, the year I started as a ninth grader at the Choate School, an all-boys prep school in Connecticut. I had only been there for three weeks but I already knew that I was going to hate the school. I was fourteen and obsessed with girls, but now it was starting to become clear to me that for the next four school years I would be living the life of a monk. Choate had a clearly defined philosophy of education, and central to it was the idea that the presence (or the thought) of girls
would be detrimental to the proper pursuit of studies, sports, religion and citizenship.
<P>
        The only members of the female race Choate boys were allowed to become contaminated with were the dining room maids, who wouldn't be hired unless they were over sixty, and the master's wives, who were mostly old or unattractive. There was one exception: Mrs. Patterson. She had been a model in New York before she met and married Mr. Patterson, and she still looked great. She knew it and dressed provocatively, or as provocatively as she could, in a prep school, in those days. During dinners on Saturday nights, when they served roast beef and the Master's wives tended to dress up, there was always a lot of traffic, including me, around Mrs. Patterson's table.
<P>
 So here I was, in line to the confessional, because this line represented a rare loophole in the Choate keep-the-girls-out-of-sight philosophy. Catholics were the only students allowed out of the Choate grounds, so we could attend to our pagan rituals at the Catholic Church in downtown Wallingford; Confession on Saturdays and Mass on Sundays, and downtown Wallingford was crawling with girls. Suddenly, like a miracle, all the Cuban boys at Choate were  becoming devout Catholics again.
<P>
        I had come with Emilio Eloy, my best friend. Emilio was not confessing anything. He claimed he was an atheist. He would wait for me to finish in a rear pew. After my confession we were headed for the lunch counter at Woolworth-the hang-out, we had heard, of the local teen-age girls.
<P>
        I was a terrible Catholic, but I still went to church on Sundays, maybe out of habit, or lethargy. I attended a Jesuit school for seven years and during some of those years I probably believed in the Immaculate Conception, but whatever religious convictions I once held were rapidly fading. Still, I was worried. It had been a while since my last confession, and I would have to confess a large backlist of sins. In particular, the
recent summer vacation had been sensationally sinful. But now I had to confess those sins, and others.
<P>
        Only one very old Polish lady stood in front of me. I wondered: What sins could this eighty-year-old great grandmother have committed? Her turn came; she slowly shuffled forward and painfully knelt down on the padded stool. As soon as she fell to her knees she started whispering to the priest, rapidly, anxiously, and continued for quite a while. Whatever she had done, she felt awful about it. 
<P>
        The priest inside the confessional made me nervous. I had gone to Mass the previous Sunday and his sermon had made an impression.
<P>
        "Imagine a piece of red-hot coal pressed onto the palm of your hand," he had said. "It would be painful, wouldn't it? Now imagine hundreds of red-hot coals pressed onto every square inch of your body. Now, this would be extremely painful, wouldn't it? EXTREMELY PAINFUL! Now imagine this horrible pain lasting not one second, not ten seconds, but an eternity. AN ETERNITY!"
<P>
        This priest relished the thought of this torment. He hated sinners and wanted them burned. He had a 
booming, disagreeable, European-accented voice. He was bald. He looked evil. I knew he was going to hate me, and he would want the powers above to roast me like a marshmallow.
<P>
        The old lady ended her confession. She struggled up to her feet, then taking tiny steps, started walking back to her pew. I moved over and knelt down.
<P>
        "Yes, when was the last time you had confession?" He asked this question with some disinterest.
<P>
        "Six months ago, Father."
<P>
        My last confession, in Havana, had been normal-for a 13-year-old boy. I had lied, I had said bad words, I had bad thoughts, I had read smut literature, and I had masturbated. That priest had given me a standard penance, five Our Fathers and five Hail Marys. He had not been too concerned. Cuban priests were fairly tolerant about the ways of boys.
<P>
        "Yes, and what would you like to confess, my son?"
<P>
        "Father, I said bad words, I lied, I read smut literature, I had bad thoughts, ..."
<P>
        "Is that all my son?"
<P>
        "No, Father." Lying to a priest in confession was an extremely serious sin, probably punishable by eternal damnation. So I continued: "I got drunk, I gambled, I saw dirty movies, I masturbated, I French kissed, I slept with whores."
<P>
        "What was that!"
<P>
        "What was what, Father?"
<P>
        "The last item, young man."
<P>
        "I did it with whores."
<P>
        The priest's head suddenly darted out from the curtained confessional. He  stared disgustedly at me for a few seconds. I was shocked, convinced that they weren't supposed to do that. I knew the rules. He disappeared back into the confessional.
<P>
        "My son, how old are you?"
<P>
         "I'm fourteen, Father."
<P>
         "FOURTEEN!" He yelled.
<P>
        "Yes, Father."
<P>
        "THIS IS DISGRACEFUL!" He yelled again.
<P>
         "Yes Father."
<P>
        "DON'T YOU 'YES FATHER' ME! What do you mean whores? Was there more
than one?"
<P>
         "Yes Father. Sorry Father."
<P>
        "My son, how many times did you commit this terrible sin?"
<P>
        I had to pause a while to think about that one.
<P>
        "My son, I asked you a question."
<P>
        "I'm trying to count, Father.
<P>
        "YOU'RE TRYING TO COUNT!"
<P>
        "Father, I did it six times, at the end of summer vacation."
<P>
        "My son, is this your idea of how fourteen-year-old Catholic boys 
should celebrate summer recess?"
<P>
        "No Father."
<P>
        "My son, you have some explaining to do."
<P>
        "Father, you see, I'm from Cuba and in Cuba this is normal."
<P>
        "NORMAL! THIS IS NOT NORMAL!"
<P>
        I looked around. The priest's outbursts had not gone unnoticed. The parishioners sitting nearby were all staring at me, including the old Polish lady, who had poisoned her husband.
<P>
        "Father," I said, in a very low voice, hoping he'd get the hint, "what I mean is, all my friends were doing it too. My father did it at the same age. I went to a very reputable and elegant whorehouse and my family's chauffeur took me there. It's a tradition for the boys in our culture."
<P>
        "My son, this is a pitiful confession." He said this with some disgust. I knew I was in for it.
<P>
        "This is what I want to know," he said, "and I want you to speak from your heart. Are you aware of the enormity of your sins? Are you ashamed? Are you truly repentant?"
<P>
        This time I was prepared to risk eternal damnation. I just wanted to get out of there.
<P>
        "Yes, Father."
<P>
        For the next ten minutes he described to me the detailed landscape of hell, where I was obviously headed, and where I deserved to go. The penance was a long one. I had never heard of a such a long penance: two hundred Our Fathers and two hundred Hail Mary's.
<P>
        I went back to my pew and knelt down. The penance was going to ruin the afternoon.
<P>
        I thought about the priest questions. Was I ashamed? Was I truly repentant?     Truthfully, no. The French kissing orgy with an American tourist had been sensational. I had been proud of that accomplishment-my first necking sessions. Masturbation was, well, necessary, or I wouldn't be able to fall asleep at night. My brothel experiences had been, if anything, embarrassing, and had not harmed anyone.
<P>
        The more I thought about it, the more I became convinced that it would not be honest for me to spend the rest of the afternoon reciting Hail Marys. It would not mean anything. To be pious at fourteen did not make sense. My body screamed for sex. It was not my fault, it was how God made me.
<P>
        I noticed the old lady from the line to the confessional, kneeling a few pews in front of me. Whatever she had done, she was clearly repentant. She was hard at work, reciting her Hail Marys. I watched her for a while, and I couldn't help thinking how we had nothing in common. I got up and walked out. Emilio joined me and we headed for Woolworth.

<H3>  KAREN ELIZABETH GORDON: from <br><i>The Red Shoes and Other Tattered Tales </i>
</H3>

An introductory note from <b>george jr.</b>: This whimsey is an outtake - dare we call it fiction, or memoir? or perhaps bibliography - from Gordon's novel <i>The Red Shoes and Other Tattered Tales</i> (Dalkey Archive, $12.95), which , taken together, is the sewn-together quilt of stories and metaphysical romps of the sort brewed, too, by Gass, Cortazar and Nabokov. Gordon is perhaps best known for her Gothic language handbooks, <i>The Well-Tempered Sentence </i>and <i>The Transitive Vampire.</i>

Anja,</b> a wanderlusting seamstress from Croatia, whose territorial seams are in confusion of late. It is thanks to Anja's chance find (a tailor's dummy stuffed with shredded manuscripts) that these tales have come to light and are taking some sort of shape--as she sorts and stitches their tatters with her Scandinavian colleague, Elsbeth.
<P>
<b>Bedruthan,</b> a reluctant romantic--and gigantic--hero of Cornish coast and legend, courageously searching for a mermaid whose only property has floated into his hands (or did he find it in the sands?).

<b>Cinderella,</b> resiliently abused stepchild whose secret rebellions in both fact and fantasy forge her liberty. Seeing past mere wish fulfillment, she unmasks social form and ceremony in her unabashed dealings with the prince.
<P>
<b>Columbine,</b> a commedia dell' arte trouper in contempo clothing who performs with her rowdy pals Pantalone, Pedrolino, Grattiano, Arlecchino, Burattino, Flavinia, and Franceschina on both sides of the Adriatic.

<b>Effie</b> (short for Ephemera, and the twin sister of Errata), a Mediterranean nymph pursued by a faun who looks like Blaise Cendrars.

<b>Elsbeth,</b> Anja's Danish collaborator, whose niece is enjoying a strange captivity: the red shoes, running us all amok. Elsbeth once floored a quipspeak critic for saying this book is coming apart at the seamstresses. It's coming together, she solemnly avers.

<b>Yolanta,</b> raving bibliophile, expatriate writer and Paris correspondent for Exquisite Corpse.

<b>SUPPORTING</b> (and cavorting) <b>CAST </b>includes:

A penguin who sniffs perfume, a clochard who steals gloves, a femme fatale who steals bouquets. An innkeeping couple on the road through the Balkans, a doctor in Baden-Baden, a pig and a hermit named Henri. An apparition who brings his custom to Anja, as Hans Christian Andersen does to Elsbeth. A peasant and his wild young bride attracted to the ocean. (He's an aficionado of metafiction, she of swift sensations.) Another peasant with a shoe to repair and a balletomanic daughter. Many cows, most of them lowing, one dead (on a bus). A hypochondriac with jet-set appointments. An unidentified neuter pronoun with wet feet and a taste for beer. A blini woman who supports her own cast of characters on the road in Mother Russia. Don Juanita heats up the socks, but not in the laundromat with poker players or with the milliner, once a shivering model. A man in a red cape poses a mild threat and provides the musical background.

An entry in the diary as the big night approached suggests that Cinderella intended to do so:
<P>
"It's almost time to go to the ball, to get all glittered up (that'll pop their eyes out!) and hot under the arms, to sweat on the prince against his buttoned-up front while his hand slides down the back of my gown. Oh prince oh baby jump on me! Take me home to my belle-m_re and my castle in the air,* and you'll sleep in my hair that even now unwinds to turn back time and polish the years in the suds the ashes and tears.** Your face on my belly, we'll calm down and discuss our wedding cake and how to frost it and how to cut our guests. How many little princes shall we beget and throw upon the land to slide down the banisters of our multilayered g_teau de noce with its moat of many colors running red with blood and blue, while I go barefoot, no more defective clothing on my body, and sleep, oh yes, till noon."

<P>
Morpheus, you came to me last night wearing earrings and you bangled into bed with shiny skin like a dark lady gleaming with secret siestas, a thousand and one tricks up her stockings, and something else to be taken, not given, and not for her to decide. I pulled you to me, pawing your breasts that rose in my hands like bread made of honey and the finest durum wheat, and you moaned and rolled over so I could admire your back shuddering each kiss I tasted of it, coming before you could wonder what the world was coming to as it came to meet you with each pulsing, answered plea. I wrapped you in my nightgown, the one you tore once twisting me out of it, just a slash along the hole my arm reached out from to get at you, and held your head in my lap in the turn it now was mine to sing you to sleep in this dark night of our body reversed. My little girl, visions of sugar daddies dancing in her head, my little paloma, my big woman of a jukebox at rest. You arrived in a cloud of smoke, damp and glowing, and the faces you showed me kept waking me through the late-mooning hours, so that by dawn I was dis-cursing on them, finally finding the dream tongue to speak the cat had made off with into the shadowed walls you brought down. My hand, soaked in your colors, reached for you when I awoke at noon, nothing but a strand of long black hair on the pillow to tell me the truth. Later, in red shorts and shiny legs, someone who seemed to have escaped one of those faces to haunt my waking, smearing her lips and slicking down her hair on the way to the elevator we shared. Darling, I know you're out there, in bright daylight, beads of moisture on your mother-of-pearly upper lip, your hips so slightly swinging as you cast your eyes down shyly and ask, "Breasts, where are you going?" and their silence sounds the roundness off the dress I can't catch you in.
<P>
Although obviously one of the Sonnets to Morpheus--which are not sonnets at all, and are an insult to Rilke, as well as to his many fine translators, viz. Stephen Mitchell and Edward Snow--this piece seems to be also part of another work, The Troubled Succubus.

Morpheus, your presence wraps around my past, the gift you found me in. Now that you're the present, it brushes past history and various outrageous misfortunes for the future and paints the way into the clearing where the only entanglement is ours. And even while the brim of each tiny wound dawned on me, there was somehow less pain, this time, in your love, which made me stay up outside all night after leaving you a note that said, "You've left my body purring so loudly the sound is keeping me awake." Specific sadnesses are spreading into a lazier, more vaguely inherent one. When I speak of places I want to sleep with you, it's not to summon dreams to fill in the present, which feels so full, but to catch some of the extra moments spilling over and touching on all sides others the way your touching me gives birth to cent mille milliards de phantom limbs

One of the Gods of American culture always - well, until recently - has been the National Endowment for the Arts. In this month's guest soapbox, countributor Robert Fox muses on a recent book about the NEA, and some of the missing gods and goddesses from the reviewed author's pantheon:
<P>
<h3>Guest soapbox by Robert Fox</h3>
<blockquote>
"Arts" has become an even dirtier word in federal politics this election year. Newt Gingrich has warned his minions in Congress to lay off the arts as they go out on the campaign trail, not wanting the Republican Party known for killing culture. The strategy at present is to delay reauthorizing the arts endowment so that next year, without the legislation needed to obtain funding from Congress, the agency will quietly expire.
<P>
The federal role in supporting the culture has been controversial since the founding of this country, as Robert Hughes documented in "Pulling the Fuse on Culture" (<I>TIME,</I> August 7, 1995).  The issue is not economic, for the NEA's budget  before the last reduction cost each taxpayer the equivalent of two first class postage stamps; it is part of a larger re-definition of the federal role.  Yet, many question the  intentions of those who use "humanistic," "liberal," and "arts" as dirty words.
<p>
What is at stake if we fail to support the national arts infrastructure is the primary focus of the title essay of Joe David Bellamy's collection, <I>Literary Luxuries: American Writing At the End of the Millennium </I> (Missouri, 1996). Bellamy provides the reader with his retrospective on American writing over the last 30 years, during which  time he was a college professor, founder of the literary magazine <I>Fiction International,  </I>board president of the Associated Writing Programs, a national service organization, and director of the NEA literature Program during John  Frohnmayer's ill-fated tenure.  Bellamy maintains that if we don't publicly support the fragile infrastructure that supports literature, literacy and the national memory will suffer.  It is not a question of supporting elite culture, he argues, but any culture at all.  "Do we want our legacy as a nation to be <I>Terminator II </I> and <I>Wayne's World?</I>"
<P>
Elsewhere in the collection he argues eloquently for arts education.  "The arts teach empathy, and empathy is a powerful basis for moral action as well as a viable mode for understanding the world . . .  The Arts open a window to help us understand others' misery, and in this way, our hostility is blunted and we have a  chance of finding peace ourselves."  Art transcends the egotism of politics.  Education however, generally neglects the imagination, an educable faculty,  "the great underrated domain of human perception, far more natural to us, and therefore far more practical, than analytical and other abstract modes of  perception" which have dominated the curriculum.
<P>	
The collection as a whole is spotty and does not live up to its subtitle's promise.  It is not a retrospective, but rather essays collected over a period of years. While some have their charms, especially the author's experience at Bread Loaf,  and his good fortune in having Reynolds Price for freshman English at Duke  University, other pieces are dated, especially the equivocal look at postmodernist  writing  in the mid-1970s, in which he attempts to find a middle ground between postmodernism and John Gardner's "moral fiction."  In attempting to assess the important American writers in the latter part of the 20th century (millennium  indeed!) Bellamy omits two of the most significant novelists to emerge in the 1970s:  Charles Johnson (a protege of Gardner's) and Toni Morrison!  The book is filled out with short reviews originally written for the <I>New York Times </I> and <I>Chicago Tribune,</I>  dated and out of context now.
<P>
In the essay "Five Sex Acts and Wild Thing:  John Frohnmayer's Last Days  at the NEA, and Mine," the author, in his role as bumbling literary Everyman at the end of the millennium, claims credit for Frohnmayer's demise as NEA chair, unwittingly joining the ranks of Pat Buchanon, Dick Armey, and Donald Wildmon,  who clamored for the political bounty.  Frohnmayer's own recounting of the episode,  concerning a poem from an NEA supported magazine (in his book<I> Leaving Town  Alive)</I> spares Bellamy the ignominy, in fact, neglects to mention his role at all.  Both versions are consistent though in illustrating the tactics of political extremists.  Congressman Armey had been after the literature program for years (<a href="uneasy.html#sidebar">see sidebar</a>).  However, it was Wildmon, executive director of the American Family Association,  who excerpted <I>Wild Thing</I>, a persona poem told from the point of view of a  teenage assailant in the Central Park jogger attack.  Frohnmayer vilified the  tactic, defended the poem as part of a venerable literary tradition despite its frightening message and at times offensive language, and was sent packing by the White House.
<P>
Bellamy quotes Frohnmayer's parting words, "I leave with the belief that this eclipse of the soul will soon pass and with it the lunacy that sees artists as  enemies and ideas as demons."  Several years later the lunacy has not yet passed. We don't know to what extremes the egos of political leaders will be driven next.  We need the empathic power and humility of the arts now more than ever, and  we need the federally supported infrastructure that has nurtured the arts well for the last 30 years.
<P>
Despite its flaws, the book has value for its impassioned yet well-reasoned defense of public support for the arts, from a writer who has served and observed  well over the last three decades.

<h3>How NEA Fellowships to Creative Writers Were Re-instated</h3>

During the summer of 1995, the 104th Congress slashed the NEA budget by more than one-third to a punitive $99.5 million but at the same time re-instated   fellowships to creative writers, the only remaining program through which   individuals can be funded competitively.  Ironically, many of the Congressional attacks on the NEA since its birth, in addition to the one that hastened  Frohnmayer's departure, have been directed at the literature program.  Some of them are as follows:
<blockquote>
- ca. 1970: literature program director Leonard Randolph defends and explains  Aram Saroyan's one-word poem<I> Light</I>, "lighght," on the floor of Congress
- ca. 1980: several members of Congress demand that Erica Jong return her NEA fellowship money since the supported manuscript became her best-selling novel,  <I>Fear of Flying</I>
- mid-1980s:  aides to Congressmen Dick Armey and Tom DeLay search the  poetry fellowship files for dirty poetry. According to then literature program director  Frank Conroy, aides were heard to complain, "Hey, this ain't poetry, it don't rhyme."
</blockquote>
LitNet, the lobbying arm of the Council of Literary Magazines and Presses,  claims credit for the re-instatement of the writers' fellowships, bringing well-known authors and other entertainment professionals to lobby Congress.  Allegedly,  Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich backed off his insistence against federal   bureaucrats making artistic decisions  when former NEA advisory  panelists E.L. Doctorow and Margaret Atwood told him bluntly that no federal bureaucrat could tell them what to think.

Thanks to our friends at the National Security Archive, Tom  Blanton and The New Press, George Jr. is able to bring you, raw and unplugged, genuine-article, top-secret messages - from Blanton's book,<i> White House E-mail </i>-  that the Reagan/Bush White House tried to destroy.
<P>
We'll bring you several of their actual email messages a week, until heck freezes over,  without editorial gloss.
<P>
<A HREF="#techies">Techies</A> will want to know: These messages are scanned ASCII  text files on DOS-formatted disk (edited by Blanton, produced by Ian Stevenson with technical gizmonics from John Martinez).

NOTE FROM: Phillip Hughes

SUBJECT: Suriname Drug Bust

   We just received word from State (ARA DAS Dick Holwill) that 
tomorrow in Miami DEA will make a drug bust resulting from an 
undercover operation that is expected to result in the arrest of the 
Foreign Minister of Suriname (Erik Tjon Kie Sim) and the
G-4 of the Surinamese army.  DEA reportedly has videotape 
of theForeign Minister offering the full protection and cooperation 
of Desie Bouterse's government to a group of Colombian drug 
traffickers and demanding an "up-front" payment of $10M for 
this cooperation -- a sum DEA undercover agents eventually 
bargained down to $1M down and $1M per shipment through 
Suriname.  Suppoesedly the Foreign Minister was also taped 
offering to use Suriname's diplomatic pouches to smuggle drugs 
to the US.

   Pending the approval of Acting Secretary Armacost, State's 
position is that the Foreign Minister does not enjoy diplomatic 
immunity here and State has no objection to his being arrested. 
State has alerted Embassy Paramaribo and instructed them to 
"button Up" in the expectation of some officially inspired violence 
if and when this comes down tomorrow.  There is no paper on 
this so far.  State will be preparing guidance on this to share with 
us if the bust goes off as expected.

NOTE FROM: JAMES R. STARK

Subject: Libya: Looking Ahead

Last week, CIA forwarded a memo recommending just such a 
public statement by the US holding Libya responsible for any 
terrorist action. 

 It was to be based on the abundant evidence we have collected 
over the past three months that Qadhafi is accelerating his 
planning for terrorist operations against American targets.  
At the time that proposal came in, I opposed it in order 
to avoid tipping our hand on the FON operation.  Now, however, 
Libya's previous planning together with the Gulf of Sidra beating 
he has taken will certainly result in Libyan terrorism against 
Americans. We need to get out some form of statement right away.  
I've called the Libya task force at State Ops and told 
them to coordinate a draft with Bob Oakley and CIA using the 
original CIA paper as a base.  I think the statement should be 
issued by State, but we might also want to consider using a 
WH press statement.

  If the Libyans do turn to terrorism, we have several very well 
developed contingency plans.  The only question is-- will we use them.

NOTE FROM: Peter Rodman

SUBJECT: Libya: Looking Ahead

  Now that we know of Libyan plans to attack U.S. interests 
in various parts of the world (in addition to the public threats 
already made), we face two predictable problems:

 -- We ought to make clear (if we haven't
    already) that we will hold Libya 
   responsible for any such attack 
   on U.S. interests.
 -- Since such attacks are now predictable,
    do we have contingency plans for
    responding? Our ships will have
    left the area; how long will it take
    them to come back? (Or should we
    keep them there longer?) Are we
    prepared to retaliate against Libya
    if its responsibility for such acts
    is clear? 

  The dispersal of our ships in the next few days will not 
be the end of this.  I hope we will be prepared.

<P>
These excerpts are from a National Security Archive Documents Disk, (C) 1995 The National Security Archive, of 260 substantive White House e-mail messages which could not fit in <i>White House E-mail </i>(New Press, $14.95) for space reasons.
<P><HR><P>



<a name=techies><H3>Techies/White House E-mail link</H3>

The White House refused to provide any of the e-mail in electronic
form. Rather, White House and other government staff printed out
the specific e-mail messages targetted by the National Security
Archive's Freedom of Information Act requests, then reviewed the
printouts for classified information and privacy issues before
releasing them in hard copy form.
<P>
Ian Stevenson then employed a Hewlett Packard ScanJet IIc/ADF
scanner, together with CAERE optical character recognition
software, to digitize the large stack of White House printouts
selected for this disk. The typographical errors, run-on
sentences, bad grammar, colloquial language and other questionable
matters found here are all exactly as they appear in the originals
-- nothing was corrected or bowdlerized for this disk. The layouts
are as close to the originals as humanly possible, including the
classification markings.

System (PROFs).
<P>
<B>April 1985 </B>- The PROFs e-mail system becomes fully operational within the NSC,
including not only the full staff, but also home terminals for the National
Security Adviser, Robert "Bud" McFarlane, and his deputy, Admiral John M.
Poindexter.
<P>
<B>November 1986</B> - The remainder of the White House comes on line with
electronic mail, at first with the PROFs system, and later (by the end of the 1980s) through a variety of systems including VAX A-1 ("All in One"), and ccmail.
<P>
<B>November 22-25, 1986</B> - John Poindexter and Oliver North electronically shred
more than 5000 e-mail notes in the memory banks of their computer systems, as the
Iran-contra scandal breaks.
<P>
<B>November 28, 1986</B> - Career staff at the White House Communications Agency
order the November backup tapes of the e-mail system to be saved instead of recycled as usual. Subsequently, investigators from the FBI and the Tower Commission use
the backup takes to reconstruct the Iran-contra scandal.
<P>
 - The Tower Commission issues its report on Iran-contra,
reprinting hundreds of PROFs notes exchanged by McFarlane, Poindexter and
North.
<P>
<B>January 19, 1989</B> - On the last day of the Reagan presidency, the National
Security Archive files a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests
together with a lawsuit against President Ronald Reagan, to prevent the imminent
erasure of the White House electronic mail backup tapes. At 6:10 pm, on the eve
of George Bush's inauguration, U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker issues a
Temporary Restraining Order, prohibiting the destruction of the backup tapes to
the PROFs system.
<P>
<B>September 15, 1989</B> - U.S. District Judge Charles B. Richey rules that the
National Security Archive and its co-plaintiffs, including the American
Historical Association (AHA) and the American Library Association (ALA), have
standing to sue President Bush, in order to force him to comply with the
retention requirements of various records acts which potentially cover the White
House e-mail.
<P>
<B>January 25, 1991</B> - After a year-and-a-half of legal procedural wrangling, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upholds Judge Richey's
ruling on standing, denying the Bush administration's attempts to have the case
dismissed.
<P>
<B>November 20, 1992</B> - On request from the plaintiffs, Judge Richey adds the White House e-mail from the lame-duck Bush administration to the case, issuing a
restraining order preventing the Bush White House from destroying its own
backup computer records.
<P>
<B>January 6, 1993</B> - Judge Richey rules that computer tapes containing copies of
e-mail messages by Reagan and Bush White House staff must be preserved like
other government records, because the electronic versions are not simply duplicates of
paper printouts, but contain additional information beyond the paper copies.
<P>
<B>January 11 and 14, 1993</B> - Judge Richey issues specific court orders requiring
that the Bush White House preserve its computer records. In press interviews,
Judge Richey says that despite his orders, he believes that the Bush
administration is planning to destroy its e-mail files.
<P>
<B>January 15, 1993</B> - In an expedited emergency ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit upholds and modifies the rulings by Judge
Richey, holding that government officials could erase White House and NSC
computer files, as long as they preserved, on backup tapes, identical copies of
what was being erased.
<P>
<B>January 19, 1993</B> - President Bush signs a secret agreement with Don Wilson,
head of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), purporting to
grant Bush exclusive legal control over the e-mail tapes of his administration. 
Working through the night, a staff team from NARA takes custody of thousands
of tapes and disk drives, hurriedly removing them from White House offices to
prevent incoming Clinton appointees from gaining access to them.
<P>
<B>February 16, 1993</B> - NARA career staff who managed the transfer describe in an internal memo how the so-called "midnight ride" had violated NARA's own rules
for records transfers and how several sets of tapes ordered preserved by Judge Richey
had been lost, erased or damaged.
<P>
<B>May 22, 1993 </B>- Judge Richey cites the Clinton White House and the acting
Archivist of the United States for contempt of court for failing to carry out his
order to issue new and appropriate guidelines for the preservation of the
computer records of the Reagan, Bush and Clinton White House staff.
<P>
<B>August 13, 1993</B> - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
vacates Judge Richey's contempt orders but upholds his overall decision that the
Federal Records Act (FRA) requires that complete electronic copies of e-mail
messages be preserved by the White House, and by extension, government
agencies in general. The appeals court remands the case to Judge Richey to decide the
issue of the dividing line between "agency" records covered by the FRA and
presidential records covered by the Presidential Records Act.
<P>
<B>March 25, 1994</B> - In a brief filed in federal court, the Clinton administration
declares that the National Security Council is not an agency, and should be
accorded the protection from public scrutiny given to the President's personal
advisers. This argument attempts to remove the Clinton administration's White
House e-mail from the reach of FOIA requests and the FRA, arguing that all its
documents are subject only to the Presidential Records Act (PRA) and therefore
not to court oversight.
<P>
<B>December 13, 1994</B> - The e-mail plaintiffs file suit against the Acting Archivist
of the United States to void the Bush-Wilson agreement, in American Historical
Association et. al. v. Peterson.
<P>
<B>February 15, 1995</B> - Judge Richey rejects the Clinton administration's arguments about the NSC's status as "arbitrary and capricious... contrary to history, past practice and the law," and declares that the National Security Council is an
agency. The government subsequently appeals the decision, and the plaintiffs
cross-appeal against a portion of Richey's ruling that opens a loophole for
senior NSC staff giving advice to the President.
<P>
<B>February 27, 1995</B> - In a separate opinion in the lawsuit over the Bush-Wilson
agreement, Judge Richey declares the agreement "null and void," writing that "No
one, not even a President, is above the law." The New York Times subsequently
editorializes, under the headline "A Special Place in History for Mr. Bush," that
"No President has the right to corner official records in an effort to control
his place in history." (March 1, 1995, page A18)
<P>
<B>September 8, 1995</B> - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit hears oral arguments in the case on the issue of Judge Richey's decision
and the agency versus Presidential status of the NSC.

<h3>JOE NAPORA: <br>WITH CHURCHES BURNING, TIME IS RIGHT FOR  JOHN SANFORD</h3>

<P>
On the back cover of John Sanford's novel <i>The People From Heaven</i>(Illinois) appear these  bouquets: "His language is marvelous" from William Carlos Williams; "A sacred book" from Carl Sandburg; "your great talent" from Orson Welles. <i>The People From Heaven</i>was first published in 1942, and these comments failed to alert the public to the importance of the novelist or the novel. The book went soon out of print. But the author never stopped writing. He is writing still at age 91. And last year's re-publication might finally make it happen that readers of the American novel will come to share the opinions of Williams, Sandburg, and Welles, for this novel is as important now, or arguably even more important, than it was 50 years ago, if only because the theme is more timely and the technique more readily understandable.
<P>
Sanford is a radical, a technical improvisor who takes fiction writing to
its roots in story that is as varied in its form as in its content. Sanford
accepts no prior formal strictures, whether they be the disguised
reactionary aesthetic formal appeals to a Beauty outside of history or
whether they be the dictates of the Party: Sanford was a communist when he wrote this novel, and the Bosses were not happy. But the novel's theme can be understood and appreciated now, after the societal revolt of the 1960s and the formal revolution in writing that has moved fiction out of naive realism and into a continual self-questioning of the relationship of fiction to fact.
<P>
Alan Wald, who provides the introduction to this paperback reprint, summarizes the novel this way: "<i>The People From Heaven</i>is a 1943 novel by an unrepentant Jewish-American Marxist about anti-Black and anti-Native American racist culture in the North of the United States." It is this, but in this time of the Militias, the burnings of Black churches, the legacy of Wounded Knee, the persecution of the American Indian Movement, the assassinations of Black Panther leaders and the FBI's campaign to destroy Martin Luther King, it is also a 1990s novel. And yet the novel was ignored, but why? 
<P>
The critics are mainly to blame for their inability to understand and
explain what Wald describes as "a tour of sensory and intellectual
experience unlike those produced by any other text in U.S. literature." The
critics failed the public, and hence the public was denied the opportunity
to be aware that this novel deserved the praise of those artists, Williams,
Sandburg, Welles, who recognized genius when they saw it. Critics are a
timid bunch, no matter how strident their prose or their pose. I suspect
they were scared of Sanford's theme and style, and they deserved to be. But we should expect criticism to rise above self-imposed intimidation. The book has power, power that scared the critics as much as it scared the communist censors. As Wald relates, when a Party critic called the novel"anti-social," Sanford replied, "Art is a weapon," and "If that book isn't aweapon, I never saw one." In the forties, too many readers never saw this one. With this re-publication, there is now the chance for readers to judge for themselves. Take it, and discover a major talent with a body of work still forming that will soon redefine the history of American fiction.

The decades-long rumors that Hal Linden Jr. and Omar Shariff 
are the same person have finally been put to rest.  The two of them 
(no, there were not any mirrors or David Copperfield to be seen) 
were observed lunching at a local eatry. Linden keeping trim with 
a light salad and Omar with his customary rack of lamb. Thank 
goodness this rumor is dead.  I could never bring myself 
to call Dr.  Zhivago "Barney."

Bill Clinton, Boris Yeltsin, and Bill Gates were called in by God. 
God informed them that he was very unhappy about what was going

was destroying  the Earth in 3 days.  They were all allowed to return 
to  their homes and  businesses, and tell their friends and colleagues 
what was happening.

God did tell them though, that no matter what they did he was 
"not"  changing his mind.  So, . . . . .  Bill Clinton went in and 
told his staff, "I have good news and bad news for you. First the 
good news . . . there "is" a God.  The bad news is  that he is destroying 
the Earth in 3 days."

Boris Yeltsin went back and told his staff, "I have bad news and 
more bad news. The first was . . . there "is" a God.  The second 
is that he is  destroying the Earth in 3 days."

Bill Gates went back and told his staff, "I have good news and

<H3> Richard Kostelanetz's Brown University Memoir </H3>

<a href="/august/rememb.html#book">Click here</a> for an excerpt from Richard Kostelanetz's book <i>Autobiographies at Fifty</i>, which tells of some of his work and efforts on behalf of John Cage, Merce Cunningham and other musicians, artists and writers.
<P>
<hr>
<P>
It was nearly 35 years ago that I graduated from one of the lesser Ivy League colleges that, we should not forget, had a quota upon admitting people like me (Jews) when I entered. I went to Brown in 1958 because a fellow three years ahead of me in high school (and now a distinguished playwright) said, simply, that if my application were not accepted at Harvard, it was as good "a second choice" as any.  One favor he did for me, after I was accepted, was taking the catalog of offered courses  and underlining certain names twice and other names once.  Thanks to his considered advice, I soon established strong relationships with some of the better professors who at Brown, unlike some other places, were available to undergraduates.
<P>
   Although my upper-class suburban high school billed itself as "one of the best public schools in the country," it hardly equipped us for a rigorous regime of research papers and exams.  At the time I noticed that the few  eighteen-year-olds who were adequately prepared, who knew how to write 30-page papers and take written exams, had gone to one of only six institutions--Andover, Exeter, Bronx Science, Stuyvesant, Hunter, and Boston Latin--which were at the time the only high schools where students were really pushed.  The parents back in my suburbia wouldn't have allowed the teachers' giving us too much work, especially at a time, in the 1950s, when "conformity" and the organization-man mentality were commonly thought ideal.  (Curiously, my father had gone to a New York City high school comparable to the select six, in the 1920s, when, as he recalls, the teachers wouldn't have been intimidated by the parents because most of them "didn't speak well enough English.")  By the end of freshman year, some of us disadvantaged high school graduates caught up.
<P>
   Since Brown lacked financial resources commensurate with its ambitions, it was forever concocting "experimental programs" that would appeal to various funding agencies.  (I hear this is still true.)  In order to justify any successful funding, it had to persuade the better teachers and the best students to participate in the new program.  Around the time I matriculated it had received a grant to replace introductory survey lecture courses with "IC" seminars devoted to the intensive study of purportedly classic texts.  Not unlike other more ambitious (and perhaps brighter) students, I was conned into taking several of these seminars, some of them taught by professors with two lines under their names. While I largely enjoyed these courses and their teachers, I also realized, especially when I got to graduate school and compared experiences with those who had gone to Harvard or Columbia, that I had learned not about the great tradition of sociology, say, but about Emile Durkheim's <i>Suicide, </i>Robert Redfield's <i>The Primitive World and Its Transformations,</i> Harrison Brown's <i>The Challenge of Man's Future, </i>David Riesman's <i>The Lonely Crowd,</i> and C. Wright Mills's <i>White Collar. </i> Instead of surveys of modern poetry and fiction, I had a single semester devoted to the complete works of T. S. Eliot and then another semester devoted exclusively to William Faulkner.  Since Brown was as    comparatively expensive then as it is now, I wondered if my parents weren't gypped.  Needless to say, when the grant expired, after I graduated, these courses disappeared from Brown's curriculum, no doubt to be replaced by alternatives funded in other ways.
<P>
   Once I got to Brown, I discovered that most of the brighter students, beginning with those individuals who became my closest friends, had likewise been rejected by Harvard or, in a few cases, Yale or Princeton.  This created among us an aura of inferiority, if not self-hate, that while it seems ridiculous in any ultimate scheme of value certainly had an impact then.  (And perhaps later, as we shall see.)
<P>
   Whereas Harvard and Columbia and, to a lesser extent, Yale were in cities that offered corrective reality, Brown resided atop a steep hill that opened to a suburb so distant from the city, not only physically but psychologically, that undergraduates never went "downtown" except to take public transportation home. We began to realize that much that was peculiar about the university depended upon the isolation, not only from the city but from any larger cultural world.  It seems incredible to me now that the University Christian Association, as I think it was called, dominated extracurricular life. Whenever a particularly puzzling film arrived at the local moviehouse (such as the Ingmar Bergman films popular then), the UCA would be the first to sponsor a symposium to discuss its meanings.  When Fulton Lewis, Jr. (or maybe the Third) came to show the film Operation Abolition (about 1960 protests against the House Un-American Activities Committee), it was the campus Protestant minister who debated him.  Not that I objected then (or object now) to Christianity, even at a time of Jewish    quotas, but at no other Ivy League university at that time, to my knowledge (not even as comparably isolated and insular) Princeton), did avowedly Christian organizations have such presence.
<P>
   Some of the more disingenuous professors likewise depended upon the isolation.  I remember one who taught a course open to only selected upperclassmen that pretended to teach the truth, in contrast to those courses that had a disciplinary subject. What he was actually doing was preaching a cultural conservatism based upon the "humanistic need for unity" in a    purportedly nihilistic world.  In order to keep his illusion of truth-teaching alive, he had to choose students who lacked enough outside contacts or outside knowledge to contradict, let alone define, his ideology.  Although he spoke of wanting to take his program elsewhere, you knew it wouldn't survive in a university with a stronger reality-corrective.  Another professor billed himself as a major emerging poet, but you had only to learn enough about contemporary poetry in general, or speak to contemporaries studying poetry elsewhere, to discover how inconsequential he was (and still is).
<P>
   Not unlike other lesser Ivy League schools, Brown had a reputation for "play," which at that time meant drinking.  Especially on weekends, guys and sometimes women from our sister school drank to get drunk, especially in the fraternity houses. Just as disagreeable as the drunks who hung around the fraternities was the open truck full of stinky bottles and cans that was invariably parked just outside the campus lunchroom every Monday.  So revolting was this bacchanalia that not until I left college was I able to consume beer amicably.
<P>
   Campus life was so disagreeable that I knew by my sophomore year that I would go elsewhere unless I could live off-campus for the rest of my time there.  Fortunately, the dean acceded to my wish.  By my junior year I had entered the honors program, as it was called, whose seminars met in the afternoons.  That meant that for the remainder of my undergraduate career I scarcely saw students whose classes were in the mornings.  (When I recently saw a class reunion booklet, I noticed that few names were familiar to me, compared, say, to high school classmates, no doubt because most of the strangers were "morning people.")
<P>
   I entered Brown wanting to be a writer and so during my freshman year took a creative writing course in which an academic novelist, now better known than before, told me I had no talent for prose, which was probably true in the narrow sense of having no talent for the kind of prose he and his favored students wrote.  Although I contributed short pieces to both the undergraduate newspaper and literary magazine, I decided to avoid the college's writing program as well as its English department, which both I and my wife-to-be (presently a Professor of English at a state university) thought inferior. Whereas she majored in philosophy, I went into American Studies.  (When I receive class reunion catalogues, I notice that most of the classmates whom I remember as majoring in creative writing are now high school teachers which, if you think about it skeptically, is what that program best prepared them to be.)
<P>
   In my sophomore year I had a friend a year ahead of me, who had gone to Exeter, whose literacy and taste seemed superior to mine, who persisted in pursuing a writing major, even though he knew the limitations of those running the program.  Buried in the catalogue was a course in "verse writing" taught by an "emeritus" professor whose name, S. Foster Damon, was unfamiliar to me, even though there was a single line under his name in my hand-annotated course catalogue.  My friend took "verse writing" initially to get away from the other writing professors.  Coming to lunch after his first class, my friend told me of "an old guy [then in his middle 60s and so a decade older than I am now] who had gone to college with E. E. Cummings and Dos Passos" and was authentically literary.  I signed up for Damon's course, even though I had no intention at the time of writing poetry; and though I didn't do particularly well at the exercises of imitating verse forms from Beowulf to the present, I got to know a literary professional who, unlike the emerging stars, was generous and sympathetic toward a beginner. Damon regularly invited me to his house for dinner; before long, I brought friends both male and female.  In conversation and by his example, he taught me how to be a professional, how to do distinctive work, rather than how to write--the two are not the same.  In retrospect, I think it was through knowing Damon that I began to publish prose in national magazines immediately upon graduating from college.  Within a few years, my first book of poems appeared, fittingly dedicated to him.
<P>
   Comparing my university to others of its class and size, I would say remarkably few of my college contemporaries (graduating between 1958 and 1965) became professional artists: one writer of children's books, three playwrights (including my high school friend), two poets other than myself (neither of whom graduated), two sculptors who were more visible twenty years ago than now, two painters who continue to exhibit in spite of scant recognition, two composers one of whom was more visible twenty years ago (the other more visible now), one filmmaker and one video artist both of whom have become university professors who have not shown new work in years.  One thing we share, I've noticed, is majoring in fields other than art.  (My theory here is that Ivy League art departments are not as strong as those in the mainstream subjects upon whose superiority the university's reputation depends.  That is why many Ivy League art majors became high school teachers.)
<P>
   One reason for this comparative scarcity is that Brown alumni in the arts rarely support one another.  Of the hundreds of editors, publishers, lecture-sponsors, gallery directors, etc., who have underwritten my work over the past three decades (without whom I couldn't have survived professionally), only four are Brown alumni; and of those four, only two were connected to institutions that paid me money, each once (one as an editor at a slick magazine, the other as an executive of a summertime arts fair).  My hypothesis is that the inferiority complex described at the beginning of this memoir makes us think that since Brown was a university full of Harvard and Princeton rejects none of us can ever be any good.  (I'll admit that I've felt similarly toward other Brown artist-alumni before I saw their work.)  On the other hand, I can think of a dozen alumni, some of them older than I, others younger, who could have supported my activities.
<P>
   The trouble, in short, is that Brown doesn't have much respect for Brown. It doesn't recognize its most distinguished arts alumni.  If a literate Princeton boy can recall that F. Scott Fitzgerald and Edmund Wilson attended their school, few Brown boys can recall that Nathanael West and S. J. Perlman went to their school.  Few Brown boys can name the filmmakers.  (Try starting with Richard Fleischer.)  Whereas Harvard paid a handsome sum to acquire the literary papers of the poet Robert Lowell, who attended but did not graduate, the Brown University Library's Harris Collection lacks comparable archives of its more distinguished literary graduates.  And it can't recognize the best alumni, because it isn't in the same league as Harvard or Yale, disingenuous advertising to the contrary notwithstanding. Look in the back cross-index of the current Brown University Alumni Directory 1994 and you'll notice that "writer," "author," "composer," and "musician" are not categories for Brown alumni, though "visual arts," and "telecommunications," as well as, of course, "financial planning" and "homemaker," are. It is apparently impossible for Brown and its designated directory-publisher to conceive of an alumnus doing what I do.  Aren't these the marks of the self-consciously second-rate?
<P>
   If my father believed that sending me to a lesser Ivy League school would economically benefit my professional career, we would agree that he was ripped off.  It is scarcely surprising, given what I've said so far, that even though I'm one of only two Brown alumni with an individual entry in a standard encyclopedia of living poets and the only actively publishing alumnus with an individual entry in a standard encyclopedia of living fiction writers, Brown has invited me back only twice, more than 20 years apart, each time to give a single lecture to a class.
<P>
   While an unformed high school student became a professional writer after four years there, thanks no doubt to the courses he took and the teachers he    had, few others did.  Many aspired, and a few began, only to disappear professionally; and perhaps my recollections about the peculiar place account less for my survival than for the failure of others.

    Successes in real estate often come as a surprise to  the buyer.
                   --John Train, The New Money Masters (1989)
<HR>


<I>AND SO FORTH</I> (1979).  A hundred-plus pages, each with a different 8" square geometric drawing, come loose in an envelope; my assumption was that any ordering of this modular piece would generate an abstract narrative in the tradition of my earlier Constructivist Fictions. Someday I'd like to do an exhibition in which the sheets would be laid in one continuous row along, say, seventy feet of walls, their order changing daily.
<P>

<I>METAMORPHOSIS IN THE ARTS</I> (1980).  A dozen years before, an art-book packager, who had a contact from a commercial publisher, commissioned me to write a text about avant-garde developments in all the arts in the sixties.  While he gathered illustrations for a sumptuous volume, I produced comprehensive essays about recent painting, sculpture, dance, music and film, as well as surveys of the new intermedial arts: environments, mixed-means events, machine art, artistic machines, word-imagery and inferential art. Though I delivered within a year a finished manuscript that was immediately typeset and corrected proofs in the early 1970s, reasonably expecting that the book would appear soon afterwards, the commercial publisher went through changes, while the packager went off to Europe for a while.  Since everyone involved claimed that the book was still in their production schedule, the typeset wasn't given to me until 1980, when Assembling Press fortunately had sufficient funds to issue it without illustrations.  Some years later, the packager asked to represent the text again, expecting to capitalize upon nostalgia for the 1960s, again without success.  As I introduced my edition as "a book that should never happen to any     writer," you can understand how merely remembering it, not to mention writing about it, even so many years later, makes me feel uncomfortable in the stomach.
<P>

<I>SCENARIOS</I> (1980).  This was meant to be the furthest-out collection of theatrical scripts ever gathered between covers.  It also turned out to have     704 pages, from over a hundred contributors; and since I had to design the book and paste it up as well, I vowed never again to do such a generous anthology     without sufficient support for a staff.  And there were no more.
<P>

<I>THE YALE GERTRUDE STEIN </I>(1980).  From the eight volumes of previously uncollected Stein texts that Yale University Press published posthumously between 1951 and 1958, I made a selection that emphasized her greatest departures and then backed my selections with an extended introduction. This began with a postcard proposal; and since the Press agreed without asking for any examples, I've always used that precedent to reply to any publisher soliciting more than a single-page proposal for a book.  ("If Yale can do it, why can't you.")  As my selections favored the more difficult Stein texts, including <I>Stanzas in Meditation </I>in its entirety, I defended the more experimental Stein against those who favor her Three Lives and Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas.  I wanted to call this book <I>Gertrude Stein at Yale,</I> alluding to the Frank Merriwell books popular with boys in the 1920s; but the     joke blew past my editor.  In the years since I've wanted to do a sequel, selecting from public-domain texts for an anthology to be called "The GreatAmerican Person of Avant-Garde Letters," but it hasn't had any takers.
<P>

<I>MORE SHORT FICTIONS</I> (1980).  This collection of my extremely radical fictions, both verbal and visual, remains, I would like to think, the most challenging     one-person story book ever published in America, for each work is not only drastically different from current conventions, but most of them beg to be  reclassified as "not fiction," which is to say something unknown.
<P>

<I>REINCARNATIONS</I> (1981).  This is the first of several books entirely of photographs, in this case of sixty-four recompositions of a favorite photograph of my face, cut apart into eighty squares, suggesting either that my character has been destroyed or that it has been reborn with other images.  Other books of my photographs, beginning with one systematically reworking the image of the Brooklyn Bridge, including another about the great Jewish cemetery of Berlin, remain unpublished, alas.
<P>

<I>AURAL LITERATURE CRITICISM</I> (1981).  A legitimate successor to the earlier anthology about visual literature, this contains extended critical essays about literature that coheres or is enhanced primarily in terms of sounds, rather than syntax or semantics.  No less pioneering than its predecessor, this remains the last book on the subject; for though criticism about visual poetry continues to appear, text-sound is rarely discussed.
<P>

<I>AMERICAN WRITING TODAY </I>(1981).  Voice of America made me an offer I should have refused--to organize fifty broadcasts about contemporary American literature and then edit two books drawn from them.  While I was slow to understand that     the USIA needed me to get the participation of literary colleagues who, if approached directly, would have turned down the USIA, the invitation seemed an     opportunity to do something comprehensive, and yet definitive; besides, if I did not accept the assignment, it would have gone to a bona fide idiot.  In the age of politicized panels, it was a pleasure to choose by myself the writers to be covered, along with the experts to talk and write about them; yet the project became more trouble than it was worth--financially, intellectually, morally.  What began as two volumes only for distribution abroad was reissued for domestic consumption as a single volume a decade later.
<P>

<I>THE AVANT-GARDE TRADITION IN LITERATURE </I>(1982).  This sequel to Esthetics Contemporary, likewise done for Prometheus, collects my favorite extended critical essays on the most extreme works and developments in modern literature. It was meant to compete with "modernism" anthologies discussing far more conservative work.  However, the book met a conspiracy of silence, because within three years the hardback copies were sold off to Archae (a.k.a. RK)  Editions, which still has plenty.
<P>

<I>ARENAS/FIELDS/PITCHES/TURFS </I>(1982).  This is the sequel to a chapbook published two years before, with the title's four words scrambled into a different order, with a great selection from the "geometric" poems, as I call them, in which four separate words, poetically related in some way, are distributed to the  four corners of the page. In two later sequences, four additional words appear in the center with their ends pointing in different directions, and then sixteen words become four squares, with me once again exploring possible poetic relationships within a severe constraint.
<P>

<I>THE LITERATURE OF SOHO </I>(1982).  Done before <I>Scenarios</I> depleted my anthological spirit, this was meant to show how the radical developments in  visual art associated with my neighborhood had their analogues in literature--visual poetry, sound poetry, structural experiments, minimalism, patterning,  intermedia, etc.; but the visual art community scarcely reads, while professional readers are too suspicious of visual art esthetics.
<P>

<I>AMERICAN IMAGINATIONS </I>(1983).  Merveverlag in West Berlin asked for a book of mine; we hit upon a collection of profiles and interviews as the best way of introducing my criticism to sophisticated readers in Berlin and Western Europe. What surprises me is how many European colleagues have actually read this book; American small publishers are rarely so effective at distribution.
<P>

<I>EPIPHANIES </I>(1983).  Walter Hollerer, then still directing Literarisches Colloquium Berlin, said he wanted to do a book of German translations of my  single-sentence stories outside his uniform series; and while this truly pocket-sized volume has only a few of the thousands of stories, the use of various typographies, with plenty of space between examples, gives a vivid idea of what can be done, not only in German but, eventually, in English and other languages.
<P>

<I>RECYCLINGS</I> (1984).  This is the entire manuscript, all 320 pages, of a book whose opening parts were published a decade before.  If anyone thought that this sustained experiment with nonsyntactic prose might have become any more acceptable in the interim, forget it.
<P>

<I>AUTOBIOGRAPHIES: NEW YORK-BERLIN </I>(1986).  Since Richard Kostelanetz himself was too lazy even to gather choice chapters from his <I>Autobiographies</I> (1981), let alone add new essays about living in Berlin in the early 1980s, Merve's Peter Gente personally spoke to Richard's twelve laboring elves, seducing them with promises of literary grandeur in Berlin and free flights to Europe on Merveverlag's outer-spatial express.  Once the translator Almut Carstens flashed her winning smile, they all went to work and, with characteristic dispatch, produced a German book.
<P>

<I>THE OLD FICTIONS AND THE NEW</I> (1987).  A companion to <I>The Old Poetries and the New </I>(1981), this reprints twenty-five years' worth of fiction criticism, collectively separating genuine avant-garde work and its traditions from pretenders that have received more attention. The book also collects a sequence of introductions to my own experimental fiction.
<P>

<I>PROSE PIECES/AFTERTEXTS</I> (1987).  Of these two books bound back to back, one collects various radical experiments with language done over the past decade, including single-sentence stories that are hundreds of words long; the other collects <I>Aftertexts</I>, which are single-page extractions of characteristic vocabularies from classic literature. Though this may well be the most unreadable book I've ever done, it is not, by any means, the least significant. Perhaps because no one has done a book like this before or since, it received only one review (from Noel Peattie, in his <I>Siappu</I>).
<P>

<I>THE GRANTS-FIX </I>(1987) is an unfortunate book.  A comprehensive expos of the failures of publicly funded literary granting, written well before the recent notoriety of the NEA and the NEH, this was commissioned by a publisher that went under.  The manuscript languished while I was working in Europe in the early 1980s.  Since most of the chapters had appeared in literary magazines, I self-published a photocopied edition, to be sold at a high price.  As my analyses go well beyond (or deeper than) current comprehension, the recent controversies always strike me as hopelessly ignorant.
<P>

<I>CONVERSING WITH CAGE </I>(1988).  Recognizing John Cage's effectiveness as an conversationalist, I composed initially for a German publisher and, once expanded, for publication here an ur-interview selecting choice passages from Cage's previous interviews. Though the book was produced with his cooperation, down to final proofreading, it is clearly my composition, acknowledging Cagean esthetics in making my own art entirely from someone else's material. Ignorant academics, including some quite prominent, often identify this book as "edited" by me.  There is no authority for that on either the book's cover or its title page; and if only these credential scholars had read as far as page xi (not "11"), they would understand why, as Cage speaks "of three ways of  composing nowadays. . . .  And a third way has developed in recording studios, which is similar to the way artists work in their studios to make paintings. Music can be build up layer by layer on recording tape, not to give a performance or to write music, but to appear on a record."  That is precisely what I did in the book (and have done in my audiotape compositions).  As the text reflects from my own tastes for challenging ideas and for humor, while minimizing chance esthetics, I'll even acknowledge that someone else could, and perhaps should, compose another ur-interview with Cage from the same sources.
<P>

O<I>N INNOVATIVE MUSIC(IAN)S </I>(1989).  This collects my most reprintable writings on music, including a broader range of subjects than is customarily found in such collections--serial music as well as aleatory, blues as well as pop--because its theme is avant-garde contemporary taste, broadly considered.
<P>

<I>UNFINISHED BUSINESS: AN INTELLECTUAL NONHISTORY</I> (1990).  This truly radical endeavor reflects the idea, so important to both conceptual art/architecture and psychoanalysis, that the wish may be as important as its realization. Between a single set of covers, I collected all my unfunded proposals, both to commercial publishers and to foundations, dating back to the beginning of my career, suggesting that they be considered intrinsic in my cultural achievement.  Though no one known to me has pursued this suggestion, I've not given up hope--not at all.
<P>

<I>ON INNOVATIVE ART(IST)S </I>(1991).  This collects my most reprintable writings on visual art, concentrating not upon painting and sculpture, as most other art     critics do, but upon such fringe activities as book-art, kinetic art, light art, and polyartistry, which is my coinage for individuals who excel at more than one non-adjacent art.  Indicatively, the individual mentioned most in the index is Moholy-Nagy.
<P>

<I>THE NEW POETRIES AND SOME OLD </I>(1991).  A sequel to The Old Poetries and the New (1981), this collects essays written mostly in the 1980s, demoting Joseph Brodsky for one while elevating radical alternatives.
<P>

<I>POLITICS IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN NOVEL </I>(1991) is my M.A. thesis, written twenty-five years before, whose parts appeared in scholarly journals at that time.  Though I tried hard to rewrite it, reading over fifty new books and reconsidering the original texts, I changed remarkably little, not because I was so bright then--I wasn't--but because I set up a scholarly machine that generated efficiently organized answers to the questions I was asking.
<P>

<I>GERTRUDE STEIN ADVANCED </I>(1991).  This anthology of criticism attempts to extend the position established in my earlier Stein editing--that the more     experimental, more difficult texts are the only ones worth considering; and this reprints some of the more insightful essays about them.  Needless to say, I planned a book of this kind many years before and, if only because I wanted to do it for so long, received no advance.
<P>

<I>CONSTRUCTS THREE</I> (1991), <I>INTERMIX </I>(1991), <I>CONSTRUCTS FOUR</I> (1991), <I>FLIPPING</I> (1991), <I>CONSTRUCTS FIVE </I>(1991), F<I>IFTY UNTITLED CONSTRUCTIVIST STORIES</I> (1991), <I>CONSTRUCTS SIX </I>(1991) are all limited photocopied editions of systemically developed abstract narratives done nearly two decades before.
<P>

<I>REFERENCES</I> (1991).  As another example of my commitment to revealing process in cultural decision-making, I published, with individual identities disguised, letters I've written on behalf of colleagues, mostly supporting their applications for major fellowships.  One sub-text here is strategies in confronting resistances to avant-garde culture in this persistently retrograde culture.
<P>

<I>PUBLISHED ENCOMIA,</I> 1967-91 (1991).  Not unlike other noncommercial writers I suffer from the angst of feeling that I'm dropping pennies into a well. Even though my work is commonly considered under-appreciated (certainly by publishers to whom I make vain appeals), I was surprised to find enough encomia to fill a forty-page, 8 1/2" x 11", single-spaced typescript that I published in a small photocopied, velobound edition.  Even though none of these books have been sold, it is a volume that I'm pleased, very pleased, to have on my shelf.
<P>

<I>SOLOS, DUETS, TRIOS, & CHORUSES</I> (1991) collects my efforts to write poems with only one word ("Partitions"), two words, and three words, relating within themselves and to each other in various ways.  The "Choruses" are nonsyntactic collections of words set in concentric circles.  No one else, to my knowledge, uses any of these forms.
<P>

<I>MERCE CUNNINGHAM </I>(1992) is an anthology collecting the best critical essays ever written about America's premiere choreographer.  This edition is considerably shorter than that initially prepared for another publisher; and should it do well, it would be good to get the excised essays, including one of mine, into a sequel anthology. The strongest essays come from David Vaughan.
<P>

<I>JOHN CAGE, WRITER</I> (1993) is a selection of his previously uncollected writings, including poems as well as essays.  The principal achievement of the book, in my opinion, is gathering into a single place Cage's prefaces to his own works, for no other composer ever wrote so well about his own art.
<P>

<I>WORDWORKS: POEMS SELECTED AND NEW </I>(1993) is a selection of poems composed over the previous quarter-century, reprinting them in over a dozen sections, each with its own preface, including visual poems, permutational poems, minimal poems, extended strings composed of overlapping words, scores for sound poems, photographs of video poems and holograms that contain only words, among other kinds of alternatives, all in an effort to be "the most inventive poet ever in America.  I'm not done yet."
<P>

<I>TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AFTER</I> (1993) is based upon notecards made at the time about rock concerts in the late 1960s, mostly at the Fillmore East.  My theme is     that, especially at the Fillmore, they were an excellent theater.
<P>

<I>A DICTIONARY OF THE AVANT-GARDES </I>(1993).  This is the first book done in decades upon a publisher's invitation, rather than my own initiative.  At first I refused, thinking it would be an impossible task for a modest advance; but then I discovered how to do it--essentially from memory. For four months early in 1992, I simply sat down at my wordprocessor and wrote entries in a disconnected order, one subject reminding me of another, occasionally checking arts encyclopedias and my own previous writings.  Before long, I had more than enough entries to make a book-length manuscript that then had to be cleaned up, beginning with the elimination of entries that were insufficient or incomplete. It was amazing to discover how many people, including friends of mine, I could  not write about satisfactorily from memory; but since there wasn't enough support to hire research assistants (or deal with people reluctant to release information), I had to plug on.  The principal difference between this and other professional dictionaries is that my book is opinionated (but how else could the avant-garde be written about?).  My principal stylistic problem was avoiding repetition; so that more than once an entry survived because of difference in style.  Should the book succeed, I might be invited to revise and  update it, much as the music lexicographer Nicolas Slonimsky (its dedicatee) was invited to revise his Baker's <I>Biographical Dictionary of Musicians</I> four  times over forty years.  (May I live so long.)
<P>

<I>WRITINGS ABOUT JOHN CAGE </I>(1993) is an anthology collecting the best critical essays ever written about America's premiere avant-garde composer. It differs from Merce Cunningham in using only essays that have never before appeared in books.  My sense is that its star is the French scholar Daniel Charles, who has written intelligently on many dimensions of Cage's music; my own contributions are probably the best on Cage's other cultural achievements.
<P>

<I>ON INNOVATIVE PERFORMANCES </I>(1994) draws upon notecards made at the time recording critical impressions of non-literary performances that, though they were seen by only a few people at the time, are still remembered by many. Between them are my extended essays on alternative performance, beginning with an abridgment of my appreciation of "The Theatre of Mixed Means" and including both my suggestions that the great tradition of American theater emphasizes performance over dramatic literature and my Smithsonian profile of the kinetic sculptor George Rhoads, who makes a kind of mechanical theater. It is unfortunate that few consider me a theater critic, because, by my count, this is at least my sixth book mostly about performance.
<P>

<I>NICOLAS SLONIMSKY: THE FIRST 100 YEARS </I>(1994) is a selection from the writings of America's best writers on classical music, done for his 100th birthday.  It is always a pleasure to read, organize, and represent first-rank prose.

<H3>Fun & Games To Frighten You</H3>
Universal  Pictures launched an innovative World Wide Web site for
 Robert Zemeckis-Peter Jackson film, "The Frighteners."  Combined 
with Universal's newly redesigned interface, the multi-level site
 -- which  at its apex becomes a 2-way communication venue with a 
voice-enabled 3D virtual environment -- will revolutionize the way 
millions of  consumers sample the latest movies on the Internet.
<p>
     Just as The Frighteners takes psychic con man Frank Bannister
 (Michael J. Fox) into the spirit world to stop a supernatural
 crime spree, so does the site transport computer users to the 
"other side"  of the Net -- a shadowy cyber-realm where ghosts 
appear and disappear, where haunted Web pages have a mind of their
 own and where graphics suddenly morph and melt away.
<p>
     "The Frighteners" site has three main components, each of which is designed
 to address different audience needs:
<ul>
    <li>A comprehensive preview section including  storyline, 
 behind-the- scenes facts, cast and crew profiles and extensive
 multimedia samples for the broad PC audience.
<li>A "2D" fully interactive Web adventure into the world of  the  film
 that delivers a rich, dynamic and seamless gaming experience for  players
 on the Internet.

<li>  A "3D" voice-enabled virtual reality environment from OnLive! Technologies that depicts settings based on the film, where  participants can explore familiar scenes from "The Frighteners" and talk with  groups of people by selecting their own animated icons, or avatars.
</ul>
      "The Frighteners" can be accessed at the new Universal Pictures
Home Page located at <a href="http://www.mca.com/universal_pictures">http://www.mca.com/universal_pictures</a>.

<h3>ActiveX Controls for  Web Pages</h3>
 
   The popularity of the Internet is growing exponentially, and developers who want to make their Web pages stand out above the rest are incorporating interactivity and eye-popping graphics. They're hot to learn how to develop the ActiveX controls that will give them even more power. In answer to that demand, The Coriolis Group has just released Developing ActiveX Web Controls  by  Al Williams (Coriolis, $39.99).
<p>
    With the introduction of the new Microsoft Internet Explorer (MIE) 3.0 Web browser, programmers will be scrambling to develop for ActiveX. ActiveX technology allows Web developers to create a new generation of interactive pages and applications usable with MIE. Developing ActiveX Web Controls is the first book to give developers the inside knowledge they need to create their own ActiveX controls. ActiveX controls provide cross-platform reusable, self-contained, standard components.
<p>
    Like Java applets, ActiveX controls can be run on the Web without downloading player programs. In more than 450 information-packed pages, you'll discover a solid, technical introduction to Microsoft's sizzling new technology, plus you'll learn step by step how to create your own Web controls.  The companion CD-ROM includes source code from the book, OCX controls and ActiveX control tools.

<h3>CNET Going After It</h3>
    CNET: The  Computer  Network (Nasdaq: CNWK) and Austin, TX-based Vignette Corporation, a  developer of innovative tools for managing content on Web sites, have signed a deal that has the potential to revolutionize  the way premier Web site publishers create and manage content.
<p>
     Under the terms of the agreement, CNET, publisher of three of  the Web's most popular Web sites, has sold PRISM (Presentation of  Real-time Interactive Service Material), its patented Web content management  and page generation system, to Vignette. Vignette will  integrate  PRISM
into Vignette's own content management product family, which  is currently in development and scheduled for beta release in October. Vignette will market and sell PRISM to the Web development community, maintaining all licensing relationships and  on-going development of the technology.
   <p>
  In addition, CNET has made an undisclosed investment in  Vignette and Halsey Minor, chairman and chief executive officer of CNET,  will become a member of Vignette's board of directors.  CNET will also provide technical consulting on an as-needed basis.
<p>
     CNET developed PRISM technology for use on its own Web sites, CNET.COM, SHAREWARE.COM and SEARCH.COM, three of the most  trafficked sites on the Web according to PC Meter  (<a href="http://www.npd.com">http://www.npd.com</a>).  Currently delivering over 1.3 million pages each day on CNET's services,  PRISM greatly facilitates the process of creating and maintaining  dynamically created Web content. Using PRISM Web publishers can  easily  customize Web content and presentation based on user interest and profile, browser capabilities, speed of connection and more.  Additionally,
PRISM is flexible enough to support virtually all authoring environments.
<p>
      Forrester Research recently reported that Web-based  content providers each spend an average of $1.3 million each year to run  their Web sites, with over 30% of their budgets targeted at content management activities. Forrester estimates that content  site  expenses will continue to outpace revenue growth until  2000.  Vignette's products are intended to reduce costs and accelerate increased Web  site revenues by increasing production capacity and content  sophistication while automating operations and reducing personnel costs.

<P><hr width=75%><P>

 <h3>Ucky Stuff Now Online</h3>


  New Country magazine  launched its new World Wide Web site on August 1 at <a href="http://www.newcountrymag.com">http://www.newcountrymag.com</a>.  The site is designed to be the most comprehensive and timely source of information on country music available today, though personally  this kind of music drives  <b>george jr.</b> nuts.
 <p>
    The site includes a breaking story on one of the artists to be inducted into the Country Music  Hall of Fame in October, such as Lyle Lovett, BR5-49 and songwriting  legend Harlan Howard, plus interviews with Shania Twain and Mindy McCready.  The site will also contain an exhaustive alphabetical discography, with  its own browser, of all 2,300 albums that New Country has rated since  its first issue. The graphically appealing discography lists and rates  all styles of country music recordings as well as some that stretch  beyond country's boundaries.
<p>
     "Our company already produces one very successful site, I-way, a  Web guide for Internet users, located at <a href="http://www.cciweb.com">http://www.cciweb.com</a>, that receives up to 100,000 visitors a month," a flak said.<P>

Well, well, well. It's the dead of summer and you're no smarter than you were in the spring. What gives? Obviously, little. But we do have the most forthcoming "life advice" columnist this side of the magic Eight Ball. Got a question? Just <a href=mailto: missy@coil.com >Ask Kitty</a>; we'll protect your  identity.
<BR>
<hr>
<BR>


<I><font size=+3>q.</font>What's the proper way for a lady in a dress to sit on stage?</I><br>
<font size=+3>a.</font> If you want to do the Emily Post thing -- and if you're a lady, you will -- cross your legs at the ankles and tuck them under you, a little to one side.  This is the only way a lady should ever sit, on stage or off.  If you want to see people who ALWAYS sit correctly, check out the females in the world's highest paid welfare family (the British royals).  If they're good for nothing else, they'll never disappoint in the sitting correctly category.  And waving.  I love that royal wave.
 <P>
<I><font size=+3>q.</font> If I wear a shirt that shows cleavage, have I lost the gender war - or does thinking about it suggest that I lost another war - to the agit-props?</I><br>
<font size=+3>a.</font> Oh, no.  You have to think about these things.  Clothes can help or hinder you in the little skirmishes you fight on a daily basis.  So it depends on what you want.  You can be sexy and powerful.  You can be androgynous and powerful.  Just be yourself and you'll be the most powerful person you can be.
<p>
But, gentle reader, tossing around words when you haven't a clue about them is like pretending to have cleavage when you don't.  I can spot a push-up bra a mile away.  "Agitprop" is a single word (no hyphen).  Like the word "propaganda," from which the "prop" comes, "agitprop" serves as both the singular and plural form of the word.  And another thing.  Agitprop is the propaganda, not the people who propagandize. 
<p> 
Don't worry about thinking about the wrong things.  Just make sure you pay attention to the right things too.  And quit fighting wars.  Life's too short.
<p>
<I><font size=+3>q.</font> Why doesn't Blockbuster Video carry the "Wallace and Gromit" movies?</I><br>
<font size=+3>a.</font> Now I want you to know, I personally called Blockbuster to make sure that they don't.  They don't.  Why don't they?  Because they are a national chain, the handmaids of Satan, catering to the lowest common denominator.  I can't believe you go to Blockbuster.  You might as well give your soul to the devil right now and start reading USA Today, because soon, it's all you'll have left.  Don't tell me, I could tell.  You live in the suburbs, buy all your material goods at hideous mega-stores, drive everywhere, and think it's so sad that there's no countryside left, that you don't know your neighbors, and can't get a good cheeseburger.  I'll tell you why Blockbuster doesn't carry Wallace and Gromit.  It doesn't make them money.  These odd little videos are expensive to buy and don't rent that often.  If you go on shopping at the mega book store, the mega video store, the mega music store, the mega food store, you, along with zillions of others in search of "convenience" and a "better price," are narrowing the choices of what anyone gets access to and of where they can go to find it.  You can't just trust the little guys to carry the expensive, relatively unprofitable cool stuff, while you line the pockets of multinational executives every time you buy everything else.  So don't even look at Blockbuster.  For anything.
<P>
<I><font size=+3>q.</font> How do I politely move away from someone who smells like cigarette smoke?</I><br>
<font size=+3>a.</font> Carry a gun.  They'll move away from you.
<p>
<I><font size=+3>q.</font> If someone asks me to create a resume for him, how should I handle it when he criticizes how I created his resume?</I><br>
<font size=+3>a.</font> Doing a friend's resume is a bit like cutting a friend's hair.  Don't do it.  You're asking for trouble.  From your friend's perspective, you'll never get it just right; from your perspective your idiot friend will never be grateful enough for your exquisite work, let alone all the friggin' time you spent on the twerp's stupid resume.  Not that any of MY friends have ever asked ME to work on their resumes.  Or cut their hair.
<P>

<font size=+3>a.</font> The mirror tells me some truth, but not Enough to merit constant thought.<br>
<blockquote> --Theodore Roethke, from  Lines Upon Leaving a Sanitarium</blockquote>
Are you uncomfy with your bod?  Ayhhh, get over it.  Nothing is quite as tedious as people who are overly concerned with body image.  Your body is there to use and enjoy.  If your "extra" fifteen pounds are keeping you from enjoying yourself, shed 'em.  How?  I'd say the best way to get your body where it needs to be is to start doing what you want it to do.  Take it slowly.  Your body will catch up and its capacity will grow.  <p>
Or go lift weights.  Whatever.
<p>
<I><font size=+3>q.</font> You sound like a philosophical being. What five books would you take  with you to a desert isle? And how about a dessert isle?</I><br>
<font size=+3>a.</font> Hey, why should I limit myself to five books?  In this, the age of transmissibility, I've gotten used to easy access to great works and ways to do research on them.  Of course easy transmissibility also has it's negative side.  
<P>
So I don't contract an incurable virus, I'll settle for a few books.  Here they are (well, this week's version):
<ul>
<LI>The Collected Poems  of Theodore Roethke
<LI>Homer's Iliad  and Odyssey  (that counts as one)
<LI>The Oxford English Dictionary
<LI>Green Eggs and Ham, by Dr. Seuss
<LI>Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon  (the big one) 
</ul>
On a dessert island I wouldn't need any books.  But I would like someone to play with.  
<P>
<I><font size=+3>q.</font>My neighbor plays his radio or CD player waaaay too loud at night, and  we're not really friends. How do I tell him to shut the hell up?</I><br>
<font size=+3>a.</font>Carry a shotgun.  Pee in his yard.  Let your cat walk on his Porsche.  Get the idea?

<H2>the joy of lex</H2> 

We interrupt our regularly scheduled column to bring you this 1915 advisory from Mary Ware Dennett:
<P>
   "When two people love really love each other, they don't  care who knows it. They are proud of their happiness. But no man is ever proud of his connection with a prostitute and no prostitute is every proud of her business. Sex relations belong to love and love is never a business. Love is the dearest thing in the world, but it cannot be bought. The physical side of love is the intensely intimate part of it, and the most critical for happiness, because of its possibilities of blundering and false feeling and wasted treasure; so it is the one side of us that we must be absolutely sure to keep in good order and perfect health, if we are going to make any one else happy or be happy ourselves."

<P>- from Dennett's <i>The Sex Side of Life,</i> a long out-of-print sex-education pamphlet
<P>
<b>george jr.</b> certainly feels better now; don't you, too?

So why do they do it? I suppose I should just as well ask why the
first cave type person drew the first shaggy buffalo on a cold damp
wall in the South of France, or why some bum Roman scratched
raunchy graffiti on the walls of ancient Pompeii. Self expression is
undoubtedly an indelible part of the human spirit. Instead of
charcoal and paints, today&#146;s Homo sapiens just happens to have
html and the World Wide Web at his or her disposal.<br>
<br>
Instead of wondering why these personal web pages exist, maybe it
would be more constructive to see if they can tell us something
about the authors of these on-line scrapbooks. Maybe we can even
get a clue as to what our culture is about; as in cave painting show
us chasing hairy buffaloes seemed to be in some 15,000 years ago.
Let&#146;s take a quick tour in our own online cave; the Well&#146;s (a
venerable, Internet suave, bulletin board) Community Pages.
(<a
href="http://www.well.com/community/">http://www.well.com/community/</a>)<br>
<br>
Uh. . . maybe we should take a psychiatrist and a strait-jacket along.
Could it be that the only thing we can learn from these pages is that
the authors are totally irreverent and self-possessed. How else can
one explain the:<br>
<br>
<em>Aikocat's Cynical Mind</em> (<a
href="http://www.well.com/user/aikocat/">http://www.well.com/user/aikocat/</a>) <br>
I never even got passed the A&#146;s before I saw this one!<br>
<br>
Oh okay, let&#146;s be fair, these pages are for the most part harmless
enough. Most even border on the serious and useful. There are the
usual &quot;Hi I&#146;m Bob and this is what I do with my life&quot; pages:<br>
<em>Eric Allen</em> (<a
href="http://www.well.com/user/eallen/">http://www.well.com/user/eallen/</a>
)<br>
<em>David Albert slept here, 1995 present</em>
(<a href="http://www.musenet.org/~aslan/">http://www.musenet.org/~aslan/</a>
<br>
(I&#146;m still not out of the A&#146;s yet.)<br>
<br>
And the relatively benign, &quot;This is my interest or hobby&quot;:<br>
<em>Big Lizard Video Home Page</em> (<a
href="http://www.well.com/user/bigliz/">http://www.well.com/user/bigliz/</a>
)<br>
<em>WELL co-founder Stewart Brand talks books</em>
(<a href="http://www.well.com/user/sbb/">http://www.well.com/user/sbb/</a>)<br>
<br>
And the standard, &quot;You're not doing anything today, why don&#146;t you
contribute heavily to my consulting business.&quot;<br>
<em>Axon Internet Consulting designs, builds and markets high quality
Web pages </em>(<a
href="http://www.well.com/user/andream/">http://www.well.com/user/andream/</a>)<br>
<em>Cap'n Crunch Home Page: as a Cyber Gypsy, I create WEB pages
on the fly, and put small businesses on the World Wide Web</em>.
(<a href="http://www.well.com/user/crunch/">http://www.well.com/user/crunch/</a>)<br>
<br>
<br>
So much for the almost normal. I, like most, are attracted to the
totally weird, and there are plenty of personal web sites on the Well
that fit this description:<br>
<em>Rau's Rodent Rehab Ranch</em> (<a
href="http://www.well.com/user/mirau/">http://www.well.com/user/mirau/)</a><br>
<em>Home Bob by the Bay, rawdirt</em>
(<a
href="http://www.well.com/user/rawdirt/">http://www.well.com/user/rawdirt/</
a>)<br>
<em>Burning Man photos by Barbara Traub</em>
(<a
href="http://www.zpub.com/mediaz/btraub.html/">http://www.zpub.com/mediaz/bt
raub.html</a>)<br>
<em>Brain Candy for Happy Mutants</em>
(<a
href="http://www.well.com/user/mark/">http://www.well.com/user/mark/</a>)<br>
<em>William A. Smith on Evolution and Why Are We Here?
</em>(<a
href="http://www.well.com/user/netsmith/">http://www.well.com/user/netsmith/
</a>)<br>
<em>David Ballinger's Universal Repository of Lozenges</em>
(<a href="http://www.well.com/user/dgb/">http://www.well.com/user/dgb/</a>)<br>
<em>black &amp; blue multiple mediums (a.k.a.the bruised duo) invite you
to indulge in other dimensions (weekly astrological forecast &amp;
kosmic art)... </em>(<a
href="http://www.well.com/user/blknblu/">http://www.well.com/user/blknblu/</
a>)<br>
<em>Say heyo to Cynsa Bonorris</em> (<a
href="http://www.well.com/user/cynsa/">http://www.well.com/user/cynsa/)</a><br>
<br>
So can we learn anything about on-line folks and current culture
from our little virtual spelunking. Well maybe that folks like to talk
about themselves, want to make money, and some are truly bizarre.
We can also conclude that many people have access to way too
much technology and have far too much time on their hand. Go
exploring yourself and see what you think. And by the way check out
this totally cool Web site: (<a

<H2>weights & measures</H2>
What is beauty? That's the word we're measuring this month. Jan Leibovitz Alloy measured its inseams and cuffs, and has come up with a better than workable 18-part definition.
<P>
Hers, that is, of beauty:
<blockquote>
(1)  <i>As You Like It,</i> Bartolli, Clapton, the Beatles,  <i>Casablanca, Starry Night, </i>the  <i>Brandenburgs,</i> the Glass family, Fred Astaire (with or without), Streisand, swing ... the usual suspects
<P>
(2) purple
<P>
(3) a welcome and graceful death
<P>
(4) snow diamonds glimmering silently slowly from the shovel
<P>
(5) oreagnancy, childbirth and, yes, even labor
<P>
(6) Gershwin, of course - and Fielding
<P>
(7)  <i>The Philadelphia Story</i> except for that <i>hat</i>
<P>
(8) eye wrinkles
<P>
(9) three stars, meditation, Havdalah
<P>
(10) the aqua/velvet guilelessness of a prepubescent chest
<P>
(11) cycle flight
<P>
(12) clamorous intersections of flatware, tabletops, pop bottles, flooring, and Mommy's best pots and pans
<P>
(13) football season: the russet thrill of burning leaves
<P>
(14) pesto and brownies (mine)
<P>
(15) Avraham Dov and his namesakes
<P>
(16) candlelight, Ferris wheels, Ginger's dresses, and swings
<P>
(17) birthdays on the down side of the bell curve
<P>
(18)  all as I perceive it

<H2>What george jr. is</H2>
<blockquote>
<p align=left><br>

<b>george jr.</b> is a monthly literary 'zine -- call it a boxcar, a kazoo, a 
magazine, whatever you like -- ever so devoted to literature, the 
national obsessions, fiction, politics not as usual; and news about the 
software and entertainment biz.
<p>

<b>george jr.</b> consists of views, an artist's portfolio, press releases and 
news, much of it sent to george jr.'s world headquarters via its faxline 
(614-899-9011), which usually george jr. remembers to leave turned on 
during the day before he heads to work.

<H2>What george jr. wants</H2>
<blockquote>
<p align=left><br>


His name, mostly. He wants to keep his name. As 
<b>Newsweek, The Boston Globe, The Columbus Dispatch</b> and other news 
media reported the last week of July and the first week of August,  two 
dozen lawyers for John F. Kennedy Jr.'s  rather gigantic, 
celebrity-filled and monied George Magazine have ordered me to "cease and 
desist" publishing this home page because, they say, they own the first 
part of my name.  (This is going to come to a surprise to my dad and 
everybody else named George, not to mention the hundreds if not thousands 
of websters named George, and to those who have George as a part of their 
domain name or web site.)
<p>
    I'm ignoring the lawyers "cease and desist,"  and am fighting to keep 
my name - because my name  actually is George Jr. and my web site is 
actually called <b>george jr.</b> and not, after all, George. I suppose 
if there's a fight, both George Magazine and george jr. will be removed 
from the web until there is a peaceable kingdom. 
<p>


    In the meantime, and as a result of this snit, citizen webheads are 
posting rants against JFK Jr. all over the place and even on his own 
magazine. It may be that JFK Jr. has no idea that his lawyers have 
attacked me. He's a junior; I'm a junior. Certainly he would know that 
there is a real and genuine difference between "John" and "John Jr.," 
just as we know there is a real and  genuine difference between George and George 
Jr., not to mention <b>George Magazine</b> and <b>george jr.</b>
  <p>
   Now, here's what else <b>george jr.</b> wants:  editorial copy from 
you, for which we can pay neither a shilling nor a pence. <b>george 
jr.</b> is especially interested in Interesting Information smartly 
conveyed first, followed by  original essays, short-short fiction and 
even reprints (which we secure permission to reprint, always, and for 
which we neither pay nor charge a dime). 
<p>
   And, if you've had any interesting dreams, send them. <b>george 
jr.</b> is interested to learn if the web has a collective psyche, as 
well  as the usual psychoses.
<p>
   <b>george jr.</b> doesn't own a scanner and hates going to Kinko's (can I say 
"Kinko's"?) to have pieces of art scanned, so send your art digitized or 
as a print if you must. No slides, no heads of cabbage, please.
<p>
   Send letters as <a href="mailto:gmyers@coil.com">email</a>, 
and press releases as faxes.
<p>
   The next issue likely will have something to do with lawyers.
<p>
   A JFK Jr./George Magazine disclaimer already appears within the 
Opening Gambit; how many more does anyone think I really need?

<b>Welcome to the September issue!</b>
<br>   This month <b>george jr.</b>  again offers you interviews to curl your hair, whet your whistle, dry your nose, urge you to register to vote or visit a library, and make you do squat thrusts on command.
<br clear=all><blockquote>
 <p>  Novelists <B>Susan Power, Alan Furst</B> and young-punk wunderkind <B>Ashley Warlick</B> star in interviews, along with <B>Charles Bowen</B>, whose latest  book is a primer on online activism.
<p>  Idaho writer <B>Lance Olsen</B> contributes a story set in Seattle. Old friend <B>Margaret Visser</B> sashays about something offal. There's always more.
 <p>  Take, for example, our informal symposium on trademark law, scattered hither and yon this issue. We added it due to the heavy legal readership of late and the wish that we'd do something, something, in response to our being threatend by lawyers representing George Magazine, which <b>george jr.</b> has nothing whatsoever to do with.
<p>
The opinions
expressed in the <a href="citizenry.html#trademark">trademark symposium</a> are
strictly those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of
<b>george jr.</b> or anyone else. 

<p>
<b>Bravura!</b><br>
   Welcome to the fun house --  what Mr. Media picked as a Pick, what Radio One and Yahoo! have picked as the site of the day and week, and what the McKinley Group picked as a Magellan Four-Star Site. <b>george jr.</b> is a monthly of actual content and nothing to sell but our souls.
<p>    Not content to sit on our collective keister, <b>george jr.</b>  this month brags up our favorite software of the month and special news for Trekkies, and  the always fabu National Public Rodeo where news  about the web, concerts, software and such appear Sunday.

<p>   Everybody else we thank and doff our hats to in the pages to follow.
<p>
<b>Still life with culture on a plate</b>
<br>
    Ah, you were wanting something from <b>george jr.</b>himself? Well, yours truly barely got through Phillip Lopate's excruciatingly self-absorbed new book,<i> Portrait of My Body, </i> and yours truly is more convinced than ever to not lard your plate with 'I think this' and 'I felt that' kind of stuff.

Ashley Warlick:<BR>

The Distance From The Heart Of Things

<P>

 At 23 years old, Ashley Warlick was the youngest author ever to win the Houghton Mifflin Literary Fellowship, which resulted in the publication of her first novel, <i>The Distance from the Heart of Things </i>(HM, $21.95). The novel is narrated in the radiant first-person voice of the main character, Mavis Black, who returns home from college to be the accountant on her family's prosperous South Carolina vineyard.

<br clear=all>
<P>

<font size=5>q.</font> 

You began <i>The Distance From The Heart Of Things</i>, when you were  just  20  and  still  in  college,  an  ambitious project for someone so young. How did that come about?

<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>

I had written a novella when I was a freshman and  liked  the  feel  of  it,  so  I    added  independent  study  in  the  fall  semester  of  my  sophomore   year   to write  some  more.  My  advisor  told  me  to  have  something  to  him   by  December. October  comes  around  and  I  have  a  couple  of  paragraphs. Thanksgiving,  and   I have a page and a half, and  then  it's  time  to  go  home  for  Christmas  and  I  ask my advisor if I can  get  a  manuscript  to  him  after  the  New  Year.  He  sighs  and tells me fine,  fine. So the holidays sweep  by,  and  then  I'm  pecking  away  at  this thing in my parents' living  room  and  all  I  have  basically  is  the  first  set  of  paragraphs  and  a  bunch  of  names.  But  I  get  something  in  the  mail,  and   one afternoon I  get  this  very  serious  message  on  my  machine  from  my  advisor  that says he needs to talk to  me  immediately,  and  I  know  I'm  in  trouble  because  the manuscript I sent him is  only  30  pages  and  page  30  leaves  off  mid -sentence.  I get him on the phone and he asks  me  to  come  see  him  --  no  details,  no  hint  of anything in his voice. So  I  set  out  to  his  house  with  all  the  speed  fear  and trepidation will allow and we are sitting at his kitchen  table  when  he  tells  me  he read the 30 pages and what  I've  got  is  a  novel,  and  he  sent  the  pages  to  his agent in New York and she says this  is  a  novel.  So  I  decided  I  must  be  writing a novel. I was told I had 'til graduation to complete it.

<P>

<font size=5>q.</font>

Hey, nice advisor. You also  got  married  when  you  graduated  --  which  came  first,  the  wedding or completing your novel.

<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>

 By graduation in June, I was really close to  finishing  the  novel  and  I  wanted to be done with it before  my  wedding  on  August  1.  So  I  rented  a  room  in  this spooky old house for a month absolutely  convinced  I  could  pull  it  off.  My  mother was calling hourly from Charlotte  and  asking  if  I  was  done  yet,  and  my  fiancee was playing  pool  in  dark  bars  a  lot  asking  his  friends  if  what  I  was  doing seemed  sane. 

<P>

<font size=5>q.</font>

 Forgive me, but: And then? And then? And then?

<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>

Around  July  4th  my  mother  
was  threatening  to  come  
up   and   get me, and my 
advisor  was  saying  that  
I  would  be  dashing  off  
the  final  sentences as I
 was walking down the aisle if I had to, that 
this was going to get done,  by God. I'd say I 
completed it under duress.

<P>

<font size=5>q.</font>

You're  young to be coming to writing full  time.  Did  you  set  out  to  make

a profession of it?

<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>

 Not really, but it's the only thing I can do, the only thing I love enough to  do. But I can't say that I think of myself as doing it -- it's  more  like  breathing,  or eating what tastes good. I  am  always  working,  whether  I  think  about  it  or  not, and a part of me  has  always  gone  to  laying  things  out  in  my  head,  has  always lived a little in the third person. It's a matter  of  paying  attention,  knowing  that when my brain turns  over  and  starts  running  with  something  I  need  to  write  it down.  My  father  is  a  natural  storyteller,  but   my   parents   never   especially encouraged  me  to  write  for  a  living.  Up  until  this  book   was   accepted   for publication, my mother was still calling me  and  saying,  You  know,  it's  not  too late to take up nursing.

<P>

<font size=5>q.</font> 

 Ha! Your novel is set on a  vineyard  in  South  Carolina. Did  you  know  a  place like it when you were growing up there?

<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>

Up until I was 11 or 12,  my  father  and  my  grandfather  ran  vineyards in York County, South Carolina, and sold  grapes  to  wineries  and  to  Welch's. It was quite a thing, when I was a  girl.  There  was  a  big  Grape  Festival  in  late summer,  a  parade  with  (Grape  Queens  in  convertibles  and   my   whole   family riding the picker, which was  always  sticky  sweet  out  of  the  fields.  And  then there were the blue million stories my  father  had  about  growing  up  amongst  all that. The heart of the book really rests in that place, that time. South Carolina  in so many ways is really nowhere at all, eerie and  vacant  and  dry,  But  my  father had come from there, and he is so  thick  with  himself,  so  wily  and  bigger  than life. His memories and  my own worked like  fodder.  As  for  true  facts  from  life, they're rarely in the book, but they're behind it.

<P>

<font size=5>q.</font>

 The narrator  of  your  novel,  Mavis  Black,  is  a  young  woman  who  seems  to have  already  figured  out  what  many  Generation  X  characters   struggle   with. What makes her different?

<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>

  I think  there  is  something  elemental  about  Mavis,  something  enduring  that makes her age irrelevant. A lot of  her  strength  comes  from  people  thinking  she's strong and putting her out there in  the  world  without  excuses.  Mavis  says  in the beginning of the story that she likes weight placed  on  her,  that  it  feels  good), and to say this, she is also saying she can take  it.  She  could  take  about  anything given to her, horrible and perfect both,  and  I  suppose  that  is  a  rare  thing. She is thoughtful and self-aware,  but  she  does  all  her  thinking  on  her  feet. She sets the tone the book rises to, and I hope it's a timeless one.

Susan Power: Naming Names 

<P>

 Susan Power's literary debut, <i>The Grass Dancer </i>(Putnam),  won the Ernest Hemingway Foundation Award in 1995. It is a much-heralded novel of interwoven tales that illuminated the hearts and minds of a handful of Sioux characters, especially Harley Wind Soldier and his mother, Lydia, who stopped talking when she was widowed. As the secrets of one tale is peeled away, another is revealed.
<p>    Next March, Power will release her newest novel, <i>Strong Heart Society </i>  (Putnam). The interview:
<p>
<hr width=75%>
<br clear=all>
<P>

<font size=5>q.</font> 

 Who gave you the gift of storytelling?

<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>

Both my parents. My mother has a tremendous gift of imagination and was always telling me stories -- true tales and those she dreamed up on her own. She also told me about the professional storytellers she grew up listening to when she was a child on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. I visited the place where she lived as a child. She took me to powwows, and frequently gave rides there to Native American friends from the community. I remember sharing hotel rooms with older women who told chilling ghost stories.

<P>

<font size=5>q.</font>

It has an especially 'oral' sense about it, as though it must be heard or spoken.

<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>

 My father read to me every night, even when I was old enough to read. This is why writing is such an oral experience for me. I have to read my work aloud over and over at both the writing and editing stages. I need to hear the language, hear the story, in order to make it live.

<P>

<font size=5>q.</font>

 How and when did The Grass Dancer evolve?

<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>

I began writing it while attending the Iowa Writers' Workshop. Even though I was handing in the chapters as short stories, for the purpose of the Workshop, I knew I was working on a novel. It would have been difficult then for anyone else to see the connections among the chapter, but the overall structure was developing in my head, and I knew the ties would be made clearer the deeper I got into the book. One of its first images is that of an elderly Indian woman in full traditional regalia dancing on the moon. Naturally, I wanted to know what she was doing there, and in discovering her story I realized I had written the first chapter.

<P>

<font size=5>q.</font>

 What did you learn about yourself over the course of writing The Grass Dancer?

I learned that I was raised even more "Dakota" than I thought. In doing research for the chapter called "Snakes," which is set in 1864, I came to understand that many of my mother' attitudes, values and expectations flowed directly from tribal customs and were not even her own eccentricities.

 Names seem to have a special significance in the novel.

<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>

Names have many kinds o»f meaning. They can carry historical weight and significance -- imagine being a Roosevelt or a Kennedy. Names can be descriptive and they can be gifts. My mother gave me her Sioux name, Wakca Wastewin (Prairie Flower) before she died, and even though I don't use it in daily life, it means a great deal to me.

 Well, why? How?

<font size=5>a.</font>

It binds me to her and to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in a  special way. A name can connect generations; it can be particularly powerful if the person who owns it endows it with his or her own strength and dignity.

<P>

<font size=5>q.</font>

You have a bachelor's degree in psychology from Harvard/Radcliffe, and a law degree from Harvard Law School. Have these backgrounds helped your writing in some specific way?

<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>

Definitely. I have always been interested in complex characters, and psychology gave me an understanding of human behavior patterns. Law influenced my writing in terms of technical craft. I have written all my life, especially poetry, but I've thought of that as a release. Studying law helped me to pull back and choose words more carefully.

<P>

<font size=5>q.</font>

Why not practice law?

<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>

Pure selfishness led me to leave the law before I'd even given it a fair shot. I was bored. The research was tedious, and I didn't feel that my creative instincts were given the right outlet. That's not to say that the practice of law doesn't require great creativity -- just not the breathless, dramatic use of imagination I was so enthralled with.

Alan Furst:<BR>

Spies and Love in from the Cold

<P>

Novelist Alan Furst is the author of <i>The World at Night</i> (Random House) most  recently, but also <i>Polish Officer, Dark Star</i> and <i>Night Soldiers</i> - books that showcase his fidelity to Furst's abiding interest in idealism, heroism, sacrifice and, yep, espionage.
<p>
<hr width=75%>

<P>
<br clear=all>
<font size=5>q.</font>

I noticed the Boston Globe said your books "transcend the spy novel." Yet espionage in World War II remains a strong element in your work.

<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>

Albert Einstein said, "This is not a gentleman's century. The principal business of this century is war." In such times, espionage is important, and people do it as an act of faith. It employs the worst and the best, and from its position you see inside and in back of events. It holds the balance in the great battle of this century -- Hitler/Stalin. It is also very much an equal opportunity employer -- Virginia Hall parachuted for the OSS into occupied territory during World War II. Under her arm she carried her artificial leg. One could go on -- eccentrics, beasts, saints and clerks, the gloriously right and the gloriously wrong -- Hieronymous Bosch visits the present century.

<P>

<font size=5>q.</font>
We never leave this stuff alone.

<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>

Hard to explain why we never stop digging at this era -- on American television as in French hearts and minds, the war never ends- It defines heroism and honor and sacrifice and nationality -- it was really the worst of times but it brought out the best in some people. There was real evil, and breath-taking goodness, people torn between opportunism and self-sacrifice. None of the peoples in this war can forget it or leave it behind -- the Russians, the French, the Japanese, the British and the Americans -- we're still living out the destinies forged in that time. Maybe the turn of the century will change that, maybe it won't.

<P>

<font size=5>q.</font>

Are Jean Casson and Citrine -- the film producer and movie star characters in THE
WORLD AT N]NIGHT -- real people?

<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>

 Based on real people -- at least two film producers I know of were involved in spying for resistance movements. The tempting thing for me came from reading about French film. The occupation was certainly one of its greatest periods. That's very hard to believe at first, but <i>The World at Night</i>, in its history of the film "Hotel Dorado" suggests a possible answer: when you can't do reality, you do fantasy, and most of French life is based on fantasy. You can ask the French about that -- I did -- and they say, "So what do you want,  reality?"


<P>

<font size=5>q.</font>

Having  written  about  two  such  dispirit   resistances   (The Polish Officer and <i>The World at Night</i>) do you think there was a right and a wrong choice?


<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>


Living in France, researching  the French and  Paris  in  1940/1941,  one  fact  becomes  clearer  and clearer: Don't lose a war. The  Poles  never  gave  in,  millions  died,  Warsaw  was  turned  to  ashes. France collaborated, the art and the cathedrals were saved, the national honor was  lost.  (In  Paris] sometimes -- especially during the Gulf  War  --  somebody  would  ask  me  if  I  was  American  and buy me a drink. Or somebody  would  whisper,  "I  remember.  I  saw  the Americans  march  in  here," But there's always  something  covert  in  such  moments.  The  French  don't forgive  the  Germans  for conquering them, they don't forgive the  Americans  for  saving  them,  and  they  don't  forgive  the British for sticking it out.

<P>

<font size=5>q.</font>

After reading The Polish Officer and <i>The World at Night</i>, it Is clear that something about Paris and the French Resistance has a hold on you.

<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>

Living in Paris inspired me to write about the Polish resistance (The  Polish  Officer),  because  the Poles fought and the French really didn't. Even in the mid-Õ80s,  you'd  go  to  the  Pere  Lachaise cemetery on the Day of the Dead (November 1), and  there  would  be  the  Poles,  at  Chopin's  tomb, standing silent in the rain under umbrellas with Chopin's  "Polonaise" playing  on  a  tape  recorder and little vigil-light candles burning on the edge of the tomb. They were still at it, they were  never going to stop.

<P>

<font size=5>q.</font>

What about the French?


<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>

The French hadn't changed either, Early research for <i>The World at Night</i> led to the British historian Alan Clark, writing about "the apathy and  resignation  that  lay behind  the  French collapse in 1940, when a people sacrificed their country  and  institutions  for  their  own  personal safety. The pleasures of wine, adultery, and civilized conversation could,  it  seemed,  be  preserved simply by refusing to fight.
 The French believe in making love, in drinking wine,  in  staying  up  all night  and  talking  about  life. Certainly the hero of <i>The World at Night</i> believes in little else. But he -- like a few hundred French men and women -- tries to resist, to  fight  back  against  the  Germans.  He  does  it wrong, at least at the beginning, but at least he tries. Why does  he  fight?  For  the  right  to  remain French.

<H2>fiction:</H2> 
<P>


<H3>Lance Olsen: Welcome to Seattle and Other Unnatural Practices</H3>

You are sitting with your wife in a turn-of-the-century cafe in Pioneer Square 
at rush hour on Friday.  You've just arrived from Moscow, Idaho, with plans to 
spend a weekend in Seattle.  See a couple of films, stroll along the icy January 
waterfront, attend a reading at Elliot Bay Bookstore.  Only when you raise your 
head from your coffee mug you see what's going to happen, clairvoyance, a 
nanosecond before it does.
<p>
I don't think he's going to make it, you tell your wife.
<p>
She continues to spread cream cheese on her bagel while reading the <i>LA 
Times </i> folded on the wooden table before her.
<p>
You have caught sight of this old guy, eighty, eighty-five, black beret, shiny 
cane, dark gray trench coat.  He teeters near an iron street lamp on a corner 
across the Square, clearly deciding whether or not to ford the intersection.  The 
traffic is dense, the light red.  Cars, trucks and busses rev their engines, 
releasing steam and particulate matter.  The old guy wobbles, peers left, right. 
Commuters insect around him over the crosswalk, collect on the other side, 
disperse.  The old guy tentatively steps off the curb, cane first.  He sets down 
one foot.  He sets down two.  The light changes to green.  The cars, trucks and 
busses come at him.
<p>
I don't think he's going to make it, you say again, for some reason feeling this is 
a fairly important point to make.
<p>
Your wife leisurely looks up and out the window, down at her paper, then does 
a double-take right out of a Three Stooges skit.  
<p>
Good lord, she says, as the first car, a white Celica, hits him.
<p>
From this distance the knock seems soft, sponge on sponge.  The cane spins 
briefly into the air like a baton. There are no horns, no brakes: it's just that 
kind of day.  The cane pauses at the apex of its arc, descends, lands in the 
middle of the intersection.  The old guy's legs buckle.  He retreats.  He pauses, 
takes stock of his situation, steps forward once more into traffic.
<p>
What is he doing? your wife asks.
<p>
Retrieving his cane, I think.
<p>
You lean forward to get a better view.  Your wife puts down her bagel and 
knife.  People on the sidewalk do not halt to watch.  The old guy gingerly takes 
two more steps.  He looks as if he is walking in bare feet on a field strewn with 
shards of glass, as if he is living in the dream you often have of navigating 
through a room whose floor is churning with rattlesnakes.  He raises his arm.  
It appears he is waving to someone, though it is impossible to tell who it might 
be.
<p>
He'll make it, my wife says, a little too confidently, a wink before the second 
car, a baby blue Escort, catches his hip and pivots him into the third, a crimson 
Jeep.
<p>
He takes short flight and lands poorly, on his knees, in the middle of the 
intersection, a yard away from his cane.  He surveys his surroundings, takes his 
coordinates, rises, brushes himself off, hobbles two steps, stoops to claim his 
prize, and continues into the path of a bus.  A couple walking toward the door 
of the cafe after a few beers notice what is happening and, interested, stroll up 
to your table.  You exchange a polite smile and point, although they are already 
looking in the right direction.
<p>
Get out the camera, the shaggy man in jeans and a calf-skin jacket tells the 
shaggy woman in jeans and a calf-skin jacket.  
<p>
She does, but discovers the camera is out of film.
<p>
What the hell are you carrying a camera for if you don't have any film in it? 
the man asks.
<p>
You're the one who wanted to photograph the ferry coming in from 
Bainbridge, the woman answers, not me.
<p>
My smile and these comments take fewer than four seconds.  
<p>
The whole event takes fewer than ten.  
<p>
This strikes you as an impressive fact.  You turn to your wife to share it and see 
her palms flat on the newspaper on the table in front of her.  You see her lips 
parted the width of a finger.  You see age webbing the soft skin below her wide 
blue eyes as she is held spellbound by the old guy's dance. When you check the 
intersection again, you discover he is airborne for the last time.  Yet this 
matters less than you might at first have imagined.  You are already thinking 
beyond his trajectory.  You already exist in your own future, remembering this.  
You remember how you will have remembered three things: the purple-gray 
color of the sky, the baton paused in sad half-light, your wife's parted lips.  
<p>
What you will have remembered most, however, is the fourth and fifth thing: 
the determination in that old guy's jaw, cocked as though ready to receive a fist; 
the homing signal in his walk.  He is the sort of guy, it occurs to you, who has 
places to go.  He is the sort of guy who has times to be there.
<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Sylvia Plath is said to have made the following pronouncement when still an infant:
<P>
Liver, liver<br>
Makes me shiver.
<P>
It was an impressive poetic debut.
<P>
Fifty-five years later, the very thought of liver is still upsetting for most North Americans. Converts to the recent gourmet revolution, it is true, now venture where it was once thought only "ethnic" people would care to go. They find themselves coping not only with liver (which is actually the least offensive of innards to mainstream North Americans) but also with tripe, brains, hearts, trotters, tails, tongues, sweetbreads, and kidneys-- every one of them the object, in various traditions, of loving culinary attention. 
<P>
Yet contemporary gourmets, even French ones, seem to pass over in silence some of the anatomical parts our own forefathers relished, such as palates, spleens, cockscombs, and snouts. Stuffed calves' eyes au gratin and braised eyes sauce vinaigre were greatly extolled in eighteenth-century France. One will still find people who like ears and testicles.
<P>
The ancient Greeks valued the splanchna, or viscera, above all other animal parts, with the exception perhaps of the fat. When you sacrificed an ox you split it up the middle, plunged your hands in, and at once snatched up and examined the liver. Deep inside the beast, it infallibly reflected reality. Did it faultlessly shine? What did its lobes, its portal-vein and gall-sac portend?
<P>
Next, the splanchna were cut up and speared as shish kebabs, which an elite inner circle of attendants was allowed to eat immediately. The ordinary meat was shared out later to hoi polloi. There is relatively little in any animal of what North Americans call "organ meats," so that getting some was for the few; it was a mark of great prestige.
<P>
The distinction between "meat" and "innards" has survived in traditional North American thought patterns, but the values are reversed. Organs are revolting for being smooth, wobbly, and shiny when raw, and still slithery or dark and firm-textured cooked. Notwithstanding Leopold Bloom's love of "a fine tang of faintly scented urine" in kidneys, most of us find any hint of excretory functions impossible to contemplate with pleasure.
<P>
All the innards tend to be lumped together in our speech, as we delicately (or with disgust) overlook their differences and separateness. The British call them offal (they fall off in the butchering). The word confirms the worst suspicions of North Americans: offal tends for them to mean simply "garbage." And indeed the original meaning of "garbage" was "offal, especially the entrails."
<P>
"Variety meats" is a name sometimes given to viscera by those trying to get us to buy them: the suggestion is that they lend variety to our menu. But also, they are themselves various, and herein lies a problem. Each of the viscera has its own particular texture and shape, and every organ has a function that is all too familiar. Kidneys, hearts, or tripe distressingly maintain their identities, even after chopping and under sauce.
<P>
A slice of beef might be known to come, say, from the leg, but we think of it as beef and not as a piece of leg. Anyway, legs are mechanical things-- not nearly so closely linked with a creature's essential character as are its "vital organs." Our language traditionally equates these with personal courage: a person of kidney, who has guts or shows pluck, is brave, while a coward can be called lily-livered.
<P>
"Offal" must be eaten fresh: it keeps far less satisfactorily than "meat," and this must be one reason why it has come to fit our cultural expectations so imperfectly. Innards seem to have become devalued in England in about 1800, when slaughterhouses were giving them away to the poor for immediate consumption. Their collective name was numbles, umbles in some dialects. Umble eventually seemed to be h-less for humble, so that a person who "ate humble pie" joined the ranks of those whose status was low. 
<P>	
The new predilection for gourmet foods is now changing the value system once again. Food that is thought of as sophisticated and prestigious often looks and tastes rather odd to begin with. (It also repels the naive majority, those who have not learned to confront it.) And if such a bizarre notion as eating neck-glands in sauce comes garnished with French culinary approval, then neck-glands (known euphemistically to us as sweetbreads) become suddenly very expensive, where once they were irritably discarded.
<P>
But eyes-- no. We still need a lot of persuading before we will accept eyes. Not even the French recommend eyes anymore.

<H2>a trifle for trekkies</H2> 
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

    Need some News, trekkies? 
<br>
Let <b>george jr.</b> do it: <p>

    <br>In  an  unprecedented  move, STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,  the No. 1 drama  series  in  first-run  syndication, will use cutting-edge special  effects  to  honor  the  30th  Anniversary of STAR TREK in  an  episode  entitled  "Trials  and  Tribble-ations."  In this special episode, Captain Sisko  (Avery  Brooks)  and  the  Deep  Space Nine crew will journey back in  time  and  come face-to-face  with  Captain James T. Kirk, the legendary crew  of  the  U.S.S.  Enterprise  and  the troublesome Tribbles. 
<p>    "This  episode  not  only  represents  a  first-ever for STAR TREK, but is a real break-through in television special effects," Executive Producer  Ira  Steven  Behr  comments.  "We  will  use 'Forrest Gump'-type effects to enable  cast  members  from  a  current  series to  visit a classic television show,  produced  29  years  ago,  and  interact with  the characters, creating an entirely new episode."
 <p>    This spirited  tribute  to  the  STAR  TREK  franchise, entitled "Trials and Tribble-ations," is  scheduled  to  air  the  week  of November 4, 1996. In this  episode,  Captain  Sisko  and  the  Defiant  crew are transported back in time by a  Klingon  thief,  Darvin,  bent  on  taking revenge upon Captain Kirk, who exposed  him  as  a  spy.  Upon  reaching  the Enterprise, Captain Sisko  encounters  the  fuzzy,  cuddly  creatures  known as "Tribbles," which have achieved  cult  status  among  STAR  TREK  fans. Through an insidious plot  using  the  seemingly  harmless  Tribbles,  Darvin attempts to destroy Kirk and his  crew,  and  Captain  Sisko  must  race against time to prevent the destruction of the original U.S.S. Enterprise.
  <p>   "The Trouble With Tribbles" originally  aired  on  NBC  in  1967,  during the second season of STAR TREK and is  best  remembered  by  fans  for  its light-hearted humor.  Guest  stars  in  this  episode  included  William Campbell and William Schallert, who have both appeared in later
incarnations of STAR TREK.  The Tribbles were soft, cute animals innocently brought  aboard  the  Enterprise  by  Lieutenant  Uhura.  Since Tribbles reproduce at prodigious rates when they eat, the animals quickly multiplied to the point  where  their  offspring  nearly  overran  the U.S.S. Enterprise.  Captain Kirk and his crew grow exasperated with these critters, until the Tribbles' insatiable appetites help expose a Klingon conspiracy.
 <p>    Since its original air date, "The Trouble With Tribbles" has consistently been chosen by "Trekkers"  as  one  of  their  favorite  episodes in the 30-year history  of  the  franchise. 
 <p>  The spin-off series stars Avery Brooks as Starfleet Captain Benjamin Sisko, Rene Auberjonois as the Chief of Security, Odo; Michael Dorn as Lieutenant Commander Worf, Terry Farrell as Lieutenant Jadzia Dax, the Starfleet Science Officer; Cirroc Lofton as Jake Sisko, son of Captain Sisko; Colm Meaney as Chief Operations Officer Miles O'Brien; Armin Shimerman as the Ferengi, Quark; Alexander Siddig as Dr. Julian Bashir and Nana  Visitor as Major Kira Nerys.
  <p>   After four seasons, STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE has garnered 4  Emmy Awards, 15 Emmy nominations and won numerous accolades, including the 1996 Screen Actors Guild Award for "Outstanding Portrayal of the American Scene," which it shared with the other STAR TREK series.

 Law and disorder? We've had enough and not enough, thanks. This month's rant,  by Gerald M. Sutliff,  is a commentary on the book <i>Smoke and Mirrors</i> by Dan Baum  (Little, Brown and Co.).
<P>
<br clear=all>
<blockquote>
Who should read this book? Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey and everyone else who wants to know how we got into this mess. The failure of the War on Drugs (WoD) and its repercussions has been ably covered by other writers and commentators, recently in the February 12th, issue of <i>National  Review</i>. Former <i>Wall Street Journal </i>reporter, Dan Baum, sets a different goal: "<i><i>Smoke and Mirrors</i></i> is offered as a map of how we got here, in the hope of suggesting a way back." By showing where we were in 1967 and the steps taken to get where we now are makes  a better case against the WoD than do many contemporary snapshots.
<P>

      Baum's map consists of short and readable scenes reported by people who were there (he eschews "off the record" sources) and of individuals making their decisions on furthering the War on Drugs. The reader can turn to any page and find a fascinating
example of someone's raw avarice for power or another's defeat and retreat. If you ever thought that the Wod, at the political level,  had anything to do with the health and welfare of addicts or about  the physical and mental welfare of our youth, this book will 
dissuade you.
<P>
     What began as political expediency, for Presidents Johnson and Nixon -- both wanted to divert attention from the failing Vietnam War -- became, under  Reagon-Bush, a war against lack of virtue. In several examples the drug  warriors are shown to be eager enforcers who show little concern for innocent bystanders. No small time offender is too small for punishment. The small time offender and the ever lengthening mandatory sentencing becomes the "body count" for the WoD.
   <P>  
      Baum makes no pretense of being an objective reporter but  avoids preaching; Instead, he provides background to show the context  in which the decision makers operated (drawn from disinterested public sources). Having knowledge of the context in which the policy statement or the decision was made the reader makes her/his own evaluation.  This method of persuasive writing is highly effective. 
<P>
     <i>Smoke and Mirrors</i> is chronologically organized. At the end of each chapter (usually covering one year) the reported political haranguing about the drug crisis is counter pointed with the actual statistics of drug use, abuse and other relevant items.
<P>
     Here is one (not the most egregious) example of duplicitous practices by our government: In 1970 when asked how to improve the political effect of reporting drug interdictions, John E. Ingersoll, Director, Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, wrote in a memo, " 'Alternatives, might be the illicit street value . . . By using
the illicit value concept, the hard drug figure would increase by at least a factor of 100 in relation to marihuana.' " Baum explains, "Born of the need to show triumph on the heroin front, street value  became the yardstick by which progress in the War on Drugs would be measured."
<P>
     This reviewer has yet to hear of a news reporter challenging a Drug Enforcement Administration or Attorney General's Office spokesman  after s/he announces drug bust gives the "estimated street value" by asking, "On what basis do you estimate the drugs' street value?"  Or  How can you be sure it's valid?" Or "What kind of research did did "What is the  exact amount of heroin, cocaine, marijuana, etc.  by value, weight, and/or purity seized?"
<P>
     Baum doesn't let his own profession off easily. He shows how the news media allowed Nixon to bury his own commission's recommendation that marijuana be decriminalized. he wasn't the first nor the last to get away with that.
<P>
As shown in <i>Smoke and Mirrors</i>, in 1970 when NIxon was  still developing the WoD:
<P>
<ul>
     <li>Number of Americans who died in 1970 from legal and  illegal drugs: 1,899
                       <li>Number who died of the flu: 3,707
     <li>Number of prescriptions for psychoactive drugs written in  1970: 214 
million
     <li>Amount spent by Americans on legal spirits, wine and  beer: $24 billion
     <li>Estimated size of illegal drug market: $2 billion
</ul>
     Had such facts been made part of the public debate in 1970, perhaps Nixon would have been denied his War on Drugs. Who else could have done it except the news media? Those politicians who privately had doubts about the WoD, then as now, with a few exceptions, were afraid to appear "soft on drugs."
<p>
     From the evidence shown in this book, it may fairly be argued that there was no _illegal_ drug crisis in 1970 (Nixon's era). During the Watergate crisis, mention of illegal drugs in the media was nil. Certainly there was no illegal drug crisis in 1980's when Reagan re-declared the War on Drugs.
<p>
     In 1990 almost one in five high school seniors (it's higher now) was smoking cigarettes every day as opposed to one in fifth smoking pot daily. We parents know the "drug crisis" is created by prohibition; when our children start smoking cigarettes we do what we can to educate and nag them out of the practice but we save our histrionics and dire threats for marijuana use. We fear that marijuana could enmesh them in the criminal justice system and ruin  their lives.
<p>
     Finally, Baum does us all a service by showing the gradual erosion of  out Bill of Rights protections over the last 30 years. It all happened under the  cover of the WoD.
The erosion hasn't decreased under Bill Clinton either. Consider the sharp increase in wiretapping by the federal government since the beginning of the Clinton administration (From 340 in 1992 to over 700 [estimated] this year). Almost all of it is for drug enforcement activities. It's enough to make this Democrat muse about voting Libertarian.

Charles Bowen:<BR>

Activism on the Line

<P>

 Charles Bowen is a political journalist active on the online press. He is senior news editor for CompuServe's 'Online Today' forum, contributing editor to <i>CompuServe </i>magazine, and a columnist for  <i>HOME PC </i>. He lives in Huntington, West Virginia. <i>Modem Nation</i> (Times/Business, $20), about political activism on the web, is his 16th  book.
<p>
<hr width=75%>
<br clear=all>
<P>

<font size=5>q.</font> 

The word "computer" doesn't appear anywhere on the front or back cover of <i>Modem Nation</i>. So, is this a computer book about politics or a political book about computers?

<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>

A little of both, I hope. Actually, this is the first of the 15 books I've done since 1984 that is NOT being pitched as strictly a "computer book." While obviously the topic embraces computers and online exploration, the subject is broader: politics, activism, Net citizenship, the future of the medium, its role, if any, in the current election campaign and where we go from here. I understand from the folks at Random House/Times Books that most stores are carrying it in their "politics/social studies" sections, which I'm very happy to hear. And just recently I got a flier in the mail called "Politics" from Borders book stores that included <i>Modem Nation</i>  in some pretty heady company, including Ted Sorensen, James Carville, Haynes Johnson, David Broder, Noam Chomsky and John Kenneth Galbraith. I had trouble getting a hat to fit for a few days after seeing that...

<P>

<font size=5>q.</font>

Where did the idea for the book come from?

<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>

 Well, I've always been interested in government and politics. As a newspaper reporter in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, I covered city hall, county government, school boards, courts, planning and zoning boards, airport and transit authorities, urban renewal boards and all those other nuts and bolts of local and state government -- not to mention LOTs of elections. (I always figured that after writing about city budgets, covering computers was a cakewalk!) Then, for the past decade after leaving daily newspapering in the mid-1980s, I've been writing books about computer communications (CompuServe, America Online, Prodigy and the others). While the  technical aspects of those services have been interesting to me -- and the how-to manuals were so NECESSARY in the first decade of cyberspace, when all the various software and hardware configurations made it so darn complicated -- I've always been more interested in the social, psychological and philosophical sides of modemming.
     For that reason, I was looking forward to the time when I could write about the medium as a "given," the way we write about the other great appliances of our age, such as TV, radio, VCRs and automobiles. When the rise of the extremely simple
telecomputing afforded by the Web seemed like an invitation to do just that, it was fitting, I thought, to make the first of these NEW books about politics and activism -- the same topics that occupied so much of my attention in that earlier important crossroad in my life.

<P>

<font size=5>q.</font>

 So, <i>Modem Nation</i>  deals exclusively with day-to-day politics of the partisan Democrat-Republican-Libertarian variety?

<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>

No, not exclusively. Of course, the story of computers and politics STARTS with the current political situation. The past four years have been simply amazing, from a "cyber-political" point-of-view. When Bill Clinton took office four years ago, the White House was so non-wired that phone calls still were transferred by operators pushing plugs into holes in a board, just like something out of the 1940s movie. Now the entire
federal government is online, from the White House to the Senate and the House of Representatives to the judiciary. Did you ever wonder why these days, everyone from your grandparents to the your banker and the grocery store bag boy seems to know about the Internet and World Wide Web? Well, I think it's largely because Uncle Sam finally got interested in cyberspace. So the first few chapters of <i>Modem Nation</i>  concentrate on the current scene in online politicking, how the computer played its part in the GOP primaries earlier this year to how to log into the campaign headquarters in the Clinton-Dole showdown this fall.

<P>

<font size=5>q.</font>

But then the book moves beyond the current election?


<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>

 Oh yes. By chapter 4, we've moved on to covering the hundreds of Web sites devoted to all those hotly contested special interests that predate the campaign and will still be hot long after the election, from animal rights and free speech to abortion, the environment, feminism, gun control. You name it. The list goes on and on. These are some of the liveliest sites on the Net. It's one of my favorite parts of the book.

<P>

<font size=5>q.</font> 

 Then what?
     
<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>

After that, the focus shifts again to what I call "cybercivics data tools" for getting information out of the newly wired federal government. It shows you how to use the Net to track federal legislation, get copies of Supreme Court decisions, texts of speeches and other documents. ... Did you know you can even find a job through the Net? The new Labor Department site has hundreds of thousands of job openings across the country listed in a searchable database. I think this gives a whole new meaning to "empowerment."
 
<P>

<font size=5>q.</font>

So, really the book isn't just about politics?

<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>

  That's right. In fact, my editor at Random House, Tracy Smith, made an important last-minute change in the cover of the book. Our original subtitle for <i>Modem Nation</i>  was "The Handbook of Grassroots American Politics Online." However, the more she and I worked together polishing the manuscript, the more we realized that the topic was broader than politics. At the last minute, she ordered up a new cover with the new subtitle of, "The Handbook of Grassroots Activism Online."

<P>

<font size=5>q.</font>

You think the switch from "American Politics" to "Activism" in the subtitle is significant?

<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>

  I do. I think many people who wouldn't label themselves as "political" are activists for issues and causes that move them. And I think activism is what the Web is to many people: intensely focused specific interests.

<P>

<font size=5>q.</font> Are we talking about a new kind of politics here, something outside the traditional "liberal" and "conservative" labels?
<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>Could be. It's awfully early in the game to try make a call like that, of course, but I think it's certain that the narrow-casting of the "Modemocracy," if you will, will have to be addressed in some way by the politicians who are used to talking to the nation on the big stage of broadcasting. The Net doesn't have a big stage, so if they want to talk to us, they going to have to come down into the special-interest Net neighborhoods
where we hang out.
<P>

<font size=5>q.</font>But is the Net really all that interested in politics? A cynic might say the Web is really only interested in commerce, in buying and selling things?
<P>

<font size=5>a.</font> Again, I think we miss the big picture if we don't broaden our terms. I've got a whole chapter in the book devoted to what I call the "little-P politics" of consumerism. Self- interest, self-preservation is a driving force in all societies, online and off, and on the Web -- oh my! Self-interest just may the veritable energy source that powers the Web. But I don't think it's only the gimme-gimme-gimme of rampant commercialism. The same instincts also have fueled the Web's remarkable interests in consumer protection, product and service reviews and anti-fraud efforts.
<P>

<font size=5>q.</font>Ah, but the Net also PRODUCES its own share of fraud, doesn't it?
<P>

<font size=5>a.</font> Oh, well, yes, and that's not the half of it! The <i>Modem Nation</i>  story is nowhere near finished because there are some truly mind-numbing challenges lying ahead for the Net. I wrap up the book with a section called "Web of Wonder, Web of Woe" that talks about some of the Net nightmares that keep waking me up, from fraud to child pornography to online bomb-making instructions. But, I tell you -- I also worry about over-zealous governments, in the name of protecting us from ourselves, trying to lower that big hammer of censorship. Repression is not the answer.
<P>

<font size=5>q.</font>So what is? What's your solution?
<P>

<font size=5>a.</font>Ah, well... I wish I could say I've come up with Bowen's Fool-Proof Plan and that I'm selling it between paper covers for $20 a copy. But I've not. However, I DO hope that we can at least persuade the would-be "regulators" of the Net to see the value in allowing cyberspace to evolve in its own way and at its own pace as much as possible. One of my heroes, the late historian Will Durant, spent most of his life thinking about what goes into the making of civilizations. He wrote, "Custom rises out of the people, whereas law is forced upon them from above. Law is usually a decree of the master, but custom is the natural selection of those modes of action that have been found most convenient in the experience of the group."
    I think we might  see new customs arise online that shape our society in the next century. It's fascinating, and frightening, and awe-inspiring -- and we all have great seats for the show.

   My Internet domain name, ESQwire and my pending trademark registration for ESQ.wire are the subject of a frivolous assault by a big-shot magazine publisher.  My nemesis is the Hearst Corporation, which claims to be the world's largest publisher of monthly magazines, including <I>Esquire Magazine.</I>   In a seven-count Complaint filed on May 15 with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Hearst alleges that the domain name for my cyberspace law "firm away from firm" infringes on the mark for its magazine for men and its trademark for the abbreviation ESQ., which it puts on watches, eyeglasses, and other items.  
<P>
<blockquote>
	ESQ.wire is an electronic law firm infrastructure  with a mission to provide attorneys with information, products and services via computer to enable them to practice law anywhere in the world with the click of a mouse.  Hearst first learned of  the word ESQ.WIRE when its attorneys spied my mark in the June 1995 edition of the Trademark Office's Official Gazette, where it was published as a pending service mark registration.   In the sixty years that <I>Esquire Magazine </I>had been in existence, neither Hearst, nor its predecessors, had ever thought of using the word "wire" in connection with <I>Esquire.</I>

 <P>	You might be thinking to yourself that Hearst has a pretty weak case for one or more of the following reasons: the marks are spelled differently; they are about different things; Esquire and Esq. are titles normally associated with lawyers; Esquire and Esq. are common words that exist in the dictionary.  Hearst does have a weak case for these and more reasons.   
 <P>	Almost forty years ago, a federal court said the following about the Esquire trademark in a case filed by a previous owner of  <I>Esquire Magazine:</I>
<P> <BLOCKQUOTE>'The word "Esquire" may not be capable of precise definition.  See Websters New Int'l Dictionary, 2d Ed.  But the fact remains that it is not a coined word but one firmly established in the English  vocabulary that has by no means become obsolete. . . We do not think a trader can pluck a word with favorable connotations for his goods or services out of the general vocabulary and appropriate it to his own use no matter how much effort and money he may expend in the attempt.'</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p> 
 Esquire, Inc. v. Esquire Slipper Mfg. Co., 243 F.2d 540, 543 (1st Cir. 1957). 
  <P>  This case has been cited as precedent by several courts throughout the nation for the basic proposition that common word trademarks are not entitled to protection outside their fields of operation.
   <P> So what gives Hearst the right to challenge ESQ.WIRE and ESQWIRE -- obvious different marks from Hearst's in an obvious different field?  Nothing.  But Hearst's case is not about rights, it is about corporate greed and power.  The power to hire lawyers to make frivolous and disingenuous claims in an attempt to satiate the greed of the Hearst Corporation.  
   <P> Hearst's case is not really about how ESQ.wire or ESQwire adversely impact on its marks, it is about Hearst's scheme to steal my intellectual property creation. The day before Hearst filed its Complaint, the corporate copycat filed applications to register ESQWIRE, ESQ.WIRE, ESQWIRED and ESQ.WIRED for computer-related fields for which it had never used ESQUIRE and ESQ.  Hearst wants my name and thinks that it can bully me with litigation to get it from me. 
<P>    Many people in my situation might simply give in because they cannot afford the legal fees.  But Hearst has met its match with me because I am an attorney, representing myself, and can afford to fight the pesky publisher every step of the way.  For starters, I have filed a motion to dismiss Hearst's case.  I also intend to file a motion against Hearst seeking sanctions for its frivolous behavior.  I hope that my victory in this litigation will help others similarly situated.

<blockquote>
<img src="imp.gif" width=130 height=197 ALIGN=right ALT="">

<P>Has your company ever suffered from an identity crisis?  It's easy to have one on the Internet.  Whether your company has established a web site, or just thinking about doing so, one of the first things you need to do is register an Internet domain name.  The Internet has become an essential medium for soliciting customers and conducting business. 

<p>
 The Web is a &quot;great equalizer&quot; for small and medium size businesses, because everyone is given the same space within which to attract potential customers (this space being the size of the customers computer monitor).  However, this equality is bought at the price of product and service overload.  When so many are vying for attention, it is important to identify yourself so customers can find you and your products easily.  In the &quot;real world&quot; you do this with your trademark.  On the Internet, you do this with your domain name.</P>

<P> &quot;mcs.com&quot;, &quot;oreocookie.com&quot; and &quot;microsoft.com&quot; are all domain names.  

<p>
Each domain name actually consists of two parts separated by a period, an identifying prefix (&quot;mcs&quot;, &quot;oreocookie&quot; and &quot;microsoft&quot;) and the &#147;top-level domain&#148; (&quot;com&quot;).  Currently there are six top-level domains: &quot;com&quot; for commercial sites, &quot;edu&quot; for educational institutions, &quot;gov&quot; for U.S. Governmental institutions, &quot;mil&quot; for military agencies, &quot;org&quot; for non-profit organizations, and &quot;net&quot; for administration of other networks.  Domain names work much like descriptive street addresses.  Each computer linked to the Internet is given a unique address called an IP (Internet Protocol) address which consists of a long string of numbers (which looks something like <I>128.161.71.26</I>).  However, because humans don't think like computers, this string of numbers is usually identified with a more memorable string of characters called a domain name.  This one to one relationship is stored in a database called a domain name server.  When someone accesses your web page or emails you a message using your domain name, the domain name server is used to translate that domain name from the easy to remember series of characters into the numbers a computer can understand.</P>

<P> But why should you bother with a domain name?  Well, for one thing, it allows you to personalize your Internet presence.  Your email address becomes: <I>you@yourdomainname.com</I>.  Your web address becomes:  <I>http://www.yourdomainname.com</I>. You can use a domain name to describe your company (as Apple Computers does with &quot;apple.com&quot;), your product (as Paramount Pictures does with &quot;mission-impossible.com&quot; or as Nabisco does with &quot;oreocookie.com&quot;), or your favorite breakfast (&quot;hotcereal.com&quot;, also registered by Nabisco). 

<p>
 A domain name gives you the same name recognition you enjoy in the real world, which is very important in a medium in which everyone, from AT&amp;T to your uncle Ed, can set up shop quickly and easily.  The thing to keep in mind however, is that you aren't guaranteed registration of your company or product name as an Internet domain name, even if you have trademark rights to those names in the real world. 
To see
 why this is so, we must delve into the process of allocation of domain names a bit more deeply.</P>

<img src="internic.gif" width=141 height=72 ALIGN=left ALT="">
<P> In 1993, the InterNIC (the Internet Network Information Center) was created as the center for registration of domain names that fall under the &quot;edu&quot;, &quot;gov&quot;, &quot;net&quot;, &quot;org&quot; and &quot;com&quot; top-level domains.  

Before November 23, 1995, anyone wanting to register a domain name simply submitted their request to the InterNIC.  After the InterNIC ran a check of their database to make sure that no exact match of the name existed, registration of the domain name would be allowed.  That was it.  No precautions were taken to insure that the name registered in any way 'belonged' (as a trademark for instance) to the person, or entity, registering it.  Registration was done on a first-come/first-served basis.  

<p>
<img src="mci3.gif" width=241 height=84 ALIGN=right ALT="">
The InterNIC simply lacked the manpower and resources to do an extensive trademark search for each name submitted.  Unfortunately, this open registration policy lent
 itself readily to abuse. 

 Parties began to register the names of their competitors.  For example, Princeton Review (a standardized testing tutorial service),  registered the name of their principle rival, 'kaplan.com'. SPRINT registered 'mci.com'.  A few enterprising individuals also recognized the opportunity provided by the lax registration measures of the InterNIC and began registering as many famous names as possible with the intention of charging the rightful owners for their as
signment.
  Marks such as 'hertz.com', 'nasdaq.com', 'viacom.com', and 'coke.com' were all initially registered by people unaffiliated with the respective corporations. As an experiment, Joshua Quittner, a Time magazine journalist, successfully registered 'mcdonalds.com' (detailed in Wired Magazine's October, 1994 issue).  Mr. Quittner even gave himself the username &#147;ronald,&#148; so his e-mail address was &#147;ronald@mcdonalds.com.&#148;</P>

<P> InterNIC policy has since changed, mainly in response to the increased number of lawsuits about ownership of domain names.  Now, to register a name, you must a) state that you have the right to use the name and that this right does not infringe upon the right of any other party, b) state that you intend to use the name lawfully, and on a regular basis, c) agree to indemnify InterNIC and related organizations for any claims relating to use of the name and d) agree to a dispute resolution process.  While this policy change certainly makes it more difficult for unaffiliated 'name-pirates' to register well known company names, it does not eliminate all potential domain name disputes.</P>

<P> On the Internet, each domain name MUST be unique.  In trademark law, the same, or a similar name may be used by two separate registrants, as long as the name is not used for similarly confusing products or services.  So, for example, there can be an &quot;Apple Computer&quot; and &quot;Apple Dry Cleaners&quot; and an &quot;Apple Restaurant.&quot;  But on the Internet, since each domain name is identified with a unique computer address, there can be only ONE 'apple.com'.  Even though similar or identical names can be trademarked and co-exist peacefully in the real world, there can be only one successful registrant of a domain name.  So how do the courts resolve the question of who has the greatest right to a domain name?  Most likely, the domain name will be awarded to the first person to register it.  Several legitimate claims probably exist for each possible domain name.  If you want to make sure that Internet users think of your product when they see the words 'lugnut.com' (actually not registered) then it is in your best interest to register that domain is soon as possible.  </P>

<P> So if you are ever planning to solicit customers
 or do business on the Internet, register a domain name
 for your company or product as soon as you can. 
 It's probably a good idea at the very least to register
 your company name as a domain name even if you have no 
Internet expansion plans.  After all, you don't want a 
similar named company benefitting on the Web from your 
good name in the real world.  Registration is both cheap 
and easy.  The initial fee for registration is $50, and 
maintenance is $100 a year.  Although a domain name need 
not be a name that is already a registered trademark, it 
is often a good idea to use a name to which you already 
have an existing legal right.  Registering a name that
 you have already trademarked will give you a better chance 
of winning a domain name dispute if your right to the domain
 name is ever challenged.  Even though the InterNIC requires
 actual USE of the name, it doesn't take much effort or 
expense to set up a very bare-bones web site (consisting for example, simple of your company name and address and perhaps the ubiquitous web signature: &quot;Under Construction&quot;) as a kind of place holder.  Most Internet Service Providers will take care of the registration process for you as part of their Business Services.  Check with your local service provider for details.

Attack occurred yesterday, 3/25.  Attacks were against Bilwascama

Recalls the Christmas Masacre of 81, the Christmas March with Bishop
Shafler of 83.  Those bastards.  Still no word from CIA if they've confirmed.

Have a gut feeling it happened though.

SUBJECT: SANDINISTA ATTACK AGAINST MISKITOS--URGENT
As you know, for years now the Miskitos have called me first---they
just got word to me that the Sandinistas have attacked innocent Miskito
civilians on the Rio Coco apparently trying to smoke out KISAN. These
are the Miskitos that they had put in the concentration camps ('82) &
recently resettled on the Rio Coco. Roger Herman says, through Adrianna
Guillen, that 3500 Miskitorefugees have gone into Honduras and need
immediate humanitarian assistance---food, shelter, etc. KISAN
paramedics are trying to deal with the wounded, fighting with KISAN did
occur. Sandinistas may have taken atleast 25 prisoners.
Roger cannot reach the Red Cross because it is Holy Week and no one is
around. He requested that we contact UNHCR for emergency assistance.
I called Alan Friers and he is checking 
to confirm the story.  I also reached Dick Holwill (the only DAS
there at this hour) to alert ARA's

front office that this attack against the Miskitos is in the process
of being confirmed by the Agency, and that they have requested our
assistance with the refugees.

NOTE FROM: JAMES R. STARK
SUBJECT: Libya next steps
I met today in Mike Armacost's office with reps from State
(Raphel, I Oakley, Platt), CIA [Deleted, (b)(1)(c) exemption] Juchniewicz),
 and DOD (Armitage, Moellering) to discuss next steps for Libya. 
 The most immediate areas of concern are the cascading indications of Libyan
 terrorist attack and the imminent departure of two of the three CVBGs
 (Saratoga on April 2 and Coral Sea on April 10).  Additionally, DOD/JCS
unwillingness to forward any option other than the 4 military targets
already identified in Libya remains a problem.  Following actions/decisions
were made: --US forces will be on [Deleted, (b)(1)(c) exemption] tether to
conduct Prairie Fire strikes (menu of one or more of the 4 approved targets)
on Libya in response to terrorist attack.  Would require new NSPG decision
to implement.

 --Once CVBG level down to one, still have to meet the [Deleted, (b)(1)(c)
exemption] Prairie Fire requirement without relying on third country
permission to launch strikes, i.e., FB-111 from UK.
 --About 7 April, group will review whet   ìher this can be done with
only one CVBG in Med. (I think extending Sara or Coral Sea is a non-starter).
  JCS option is to bring Enterprise from IO. But this takes longer than
[Deleted, (b)(1)(c) exemption] and may not get [Deleted, (b)(1)(c)] due NPW
issue.
 --State drafting cables for us to send to UK, France, Italy via
cabinet channels highlighting extensive indicators of Libyan
terrorist threat, our resolve to respond, and giving heads up
on possible request to stage through them.

 --DOD will send list of [Deleted,(b)(1)(s) exemption] targets referred
to by CJCS at 14 Mar NSPG.  They would not consider additional military
targets [One line and a half deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] or political
targets [One line and a half deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] due possibility
of collateral damage).
[One line deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] State afraid of terrorist attack
fol by airport closure which would prevent extraction of Amcits [Deleted,
(b)(1)(s) exemption]
  --The [One line and a half dele    ted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] I
don't believe it. [One line and a half deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption]
     I remain concerned at our inability to get expanded target options
out of DOD.  The four Prairie Fire targets are a limp-wrist response
which don't even put a dent in Libya's military capability.  If we have
to go in and take casualties, which we surely will, then we ought to
make it count for something.  I would like to discuss with you Friday.

[One line   þ and a half deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] that they are
planning to attack US Embassy -- presumably in Beirut--tonight. State
has the cable and is alerting Reggie Bartholomew.
   If a terrorist attack is mounted, either in Lebanon or any of the
other areas with hard evidence of Libyan invovement, we need to be ready
to order implementation of PRAIRIE FIRE.  As long as 3 CVBG are in the Med.
this won't be a problem, though I would recommend that at least 2 of them

In re Blowpipe, I think I would look    for other sources. Surely

NOTE FROM: OLIVER NORTH
Subject: Special Mtg: Central America
Will, please pass to Don: This weekend's trip to Honduras and El Salvador
was the most depressing venture in my four years of working the Centam
issue. There is great anxiety that the Congress will not act in time to
stave off a major defeat for the resistance. This sense exists in the
Govts. of Honduras and El Salvador but most alarmingly is now evident
in the resistance itself. The lack of a reliable source of resupply has
not only affected combat operations, it is now beginning to affect the
political viabllity of the UNO leadership. Bermudez, in front of the
Southern Front commander, El Negro Chammoro questioned the need for
UNO and the drain of scarce resources to support the Atlantic and Southern
fronts. While he committed to send in 6-8000 troops in the next few days,
he openly admitted in front of Bustillio that they wd have to come   
Ãback out in 15-20 days if there is no resupply. As known, their most
pressing need is for anti-air, but other things are now running short as
well. The entire force is back to 1 meal per day and no more boots,
uniforms, packs, ponchos or weapons are available for tbe new recruits.
All new trainees will be turned away effective today. All hospitalization
for WIAs will cease at the end of the week. Troops returning to Nicaragua
this week will carry only70-100 rounds of ammo instead of the 500 they
had been carrying. No new radio batteries are available so there is no
way to pass commands or intelligence.

Tbe picture is, in short, very dismal unless a new source of "bridge"
funding can be identified. While we should not raise specific sources
with Fred et al, we need to explore this problem urgently or there
won't be a force to help when the Congress finally acts. Warm regards,
North

NOTE FROM: OLIVER NORTH
Subject: CONTRA PROJECT
I know that many have provided input re this missive, but before I
depart for a day and one half, let me try to respond briefly:
Notwithstanding some of the historical inaccuracies in Ben's book
 -and the fact that many legislative constraints have been imposed
on the President since Truman and Eisenhower, there are still several
things which can - and perhaps should be done. When I was in El Salvador
two weeks ago, Bustillo again raised the issue of Salvadoran, Guatemalan
and Honduran support for a "liberated zone" in Nicaraguan territo   ìry.
I am very reluctant to raise this for fear that we will be accused
of manipulating the event (a la the Tonkin Gulf accusations) - but
it is entirely likely that within the next 6 to 8 weeks, the resistance
will make a major effort to capture a principal coastal population
center, run up the blue and white Nicaraguan flag, salute it - an
scream like hell for help. At that point the rest of the world will
wait to see what we do - recognize the new territory - and UNO as
the govt - or evacuate them as in a Bay of Pigs. It will undoubtedly
be a major crisis - for us and many others. News of this plan leaking
out could well doom it and we may even want to in order to prevent it.
The important thing to know is that Bermudez, Chamorro and the Indian
military leaders have already talked to Bustillo, the Guatemalans and
the [Deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] - and they all said the same thing:
it depends on what the Gringos do. The Salvadorans clearly relish the
thought of using their airforce to b   úomb hell out of Sandinista tanks
counterattacking up muddy roads. They wd expect the use of presidential
emerg authorities to replenish expenditures and losses. I believe that
we cd expect the same action from the Guats, Panamanians, Honduras and
[Deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] U.S. direct assistance to the Democratic
Govt of Nic wd be limited to offshore support, Air cover (but not bombing,)
and a guarantee that the introduction of Cuban troops, Migs or a
seaborne assault wd be met w/ U.S. military force. My guess is that
most of the Latin Americans (not Mexico) will follow our lead
w/recognition and that the American body politic wd respond very
favorably to the image of the DRF engaged in a final desperate
struggle and that we could act within 4-5 days with significant help - 
including prompt Congressional action on funds, authorities, etc. It
may be the only way we ever get to help given that O'Neill is working
to screw them again and that there seems to be no stopping DRF planning
for the scenario    described above, anyway. The DRF has finally had
it with our empty promises of help tomorrow - and intend to seize the
initiative at tremendous risk. They see no other course.There probably
isn't any.  Warm regards, North

NOTE FROM: Raymond Burghardt
Subject: CONTRA PROJECT
I believe Ron Sable has responded on the issue of expedited procedures,
noting that this proposal would become available for a vote about the
same time as the milcon bill. I leave further comment on legislative
strategy to him. On the second part of JMP's note, Elliott, Allen Fiers,
Ollie and I plus others discussed this at a RIG meeting yesterday. Brief
answer is: yes, we could use 506a to assist a new UNO-led government
after dercognizing the Sandinistas. If this involved holding territory
in Nicaragua, we would have the task of assisting them in a very difficult
defensive operation. The contras have not tried to hold territory in the
past because of the di   ÿfficulty. As Elliott has noted, we may then
have to consider naval quarantine and other actions. A second route would
be to assist a government-in-exile. This would require Honduran cooperation,
 which would be a radical departure from their present stance but perhaps
not impossible. Abe Sofaer is looking into this in more depth. Our basic
conclusion is that the great difficulty and risk involved in these options
only underlines the importance of getting aid supported in congress. Elliott
notes that Leiken, Cameron and other meddlers say McCurdy is now prepared
to support a version which is closer to acceptable (e.g. second vote after
nine months, defensive weapons up front, etc.). Abrams recommends, and I
concur, that Don should convene an early meeting of the Core Group to look
at where we are on the Hill.

NOTE FROM: Peter Rodman
SUBJECT: Memo on Combatting Terrorism

  This memo was sent over to you   À last night from Ollie and Bob Earl.
I cleared it, but one comment I made did not get reflected. In one or two
places it would have you admitting to Cap that the probability of a new 
US strike against Libya is currently low unless there is new Libyan
"spectacular." I agree with you that a new US strike against Libya is
unlikely in the absence of a new terrorist "spectacular" clearly
attributable to Libya; however, I don't think any of us can say when
such an event might come. As far as I can tell, Qadhafi has several plots
still cooking.
  More importantly, I don't think we want to give DoD and JCS any excuse
for continued procrastination on coming up with a sensible target list
that meets our political criteria. There is no excuse for not being
ready when the next big terrorist event occurs. If it happened today,
we would be nowhere near ready.

advise that the Arias Govt [One line deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] "was

mentioned. I called [Deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] to confirm the info
and he returned call at 0030 verifying the info. I then had a conference
call w/ Tambs, Abrams and Fiers and we agreed on the following sequence:

were held, Arias [One line deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] wd never see
a nickel of t   ñhe $80M that McPhearson had promised him earlier on Friday.
 --Tambs then called Arias from his leave location in W. Va. and
confirmed what I had said and suggested that Arias talk to Elliott
for further confirmation. --Arias then got the same word from Elliott.
 --[One line deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] At 0300 Arias called back to
advise that there wd be no press conference and no team of reporters sent
to the airfield.  As a precaution, the Project a/c were flown to Ilopango
last night and no project personnel remain in site at the field other than
local guards (8).  Fiers advises today that this operation vas timed to
coincide w/ the Conference on our $100M and was directed by the Cubans.
[Two lines deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] - but that I wd reconsider if
things looked better next wk. I recognize that I was well beyond my 
charter in dealing w/ a head of state this way and in making threats/offers
that may be impossible to deliver, but under the circumstances and
w/Elliott's concurrence -    ÷it seemed like the only thing we could
do. Best of all, it seems to have worked. I believe that it is important
that you or Al or both make a trip down there again as soon as the $100M
is approved so that someone w/ more horsepower than I can look Arias -

Subject: Public Affairs Campaign on Central America
Elliott Abrams has just called from New York, followed by an urgent call
from Fiers. Last night Costa Rican Interior Minister Garion held a press
conference in San Jose and announced that Costa Rican authorities had
discovered a secret airstrip in Costa Rica tha   ÿt was over a mile
long and which had been built and used by a Co. called Udall Services
for supporting the Contras. In the press conference the minister named
one of Dick's agents (Olmstead) as the man who set up the field as a
"training base for U.S. military advisors." Damage assessment: Udall
Resources, Inc., S.A. is a proprietary of Project Democracy. It will
cease to exist by noon today. There are no USG fingerprints on any of
the operation and Olmstead is not the name of the agent - Olmstead does
not exist.
 We have moved all Udall resoucces (48K) to another account in Panama,
where Udall maintained an answering service and cover office. The office
is now gone as are all files and paperwork. The bottomline is that

U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upholds Judge Richey's
ruling on standing, denying the Bush administration's attempts to have the case
dismissed.
<P>
<B>November 20, 1992</B> - On request from the plaintiffs, Judge Richey adds the White House e-mail from the lame-duck Bush administration to the case, issuing a
restraining order preventing the Bush White House from destroying its own
backup computer records.
<P>
<B>January 6, 1993</B> - Judge Richey rules that computer tapes containing copies of
e-mail messages by Reagan and Bush White House staff must be preserved like
other government records, because the electronic versions are not simply duplicates of
paper printouts, but contain additional information beyond the paper copies.
<P>
<B>January 11 and 14, 1993</B> - Judge Richey issues specific court orders requiring
that the Bush White House preserve its computer records. In press interviews,
Judge Richey says that despite his orders, he believes that the Bush
administration is planning to destroy its e-mail files.
<P>
<B>January 15, 1993</B> - In an expedited emergency ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit upholds and modifies the rulings by Judge
Richey, holding that government officials could erase White House and NSC
computer files, as long as they preserved, on backup tapes, identical copies of
what was being erased.
<P>
<B>January 19, 1993</B> - President Bush signs a secret agreement with Don Wilson,
head of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), purporting to
grant Bush exclusive legal control over the e-mail tapes of his administration. 
Working through the night, a staff team from NARA takes custody of thousands
of tapes and disk drives, hurriedly removing them from White House offices to
prevent incoming Clinton appointees from gaining access to them.
<P>
<B>February 16, 1993</B> - NARA career staff who managed the transfer describe in an internal memo how the so-called "midnight ride" had violated NARA's own rules
for records transfers and how several sets of tapes ordered preserved by Judge Richey
had been lost, erased or damaged.
<P>
<B>May 22, 1993 </B>- Judge Richey cites the Clinton White House and the acting
Archivist of the United States for contempt of court for failing to carry out his
order to issue new and appropriate guidelines for the preservation of the
computer records of the Reagan, Bush and Clinton White House staff.
<P>
<B>August 13, 1993</B> - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
vacates Judge Richey's contempt orders but upholds his overall decision that the
Federal Records Act (FRA) requires that complete electronic copies of e-mail
messages be preserved by the White House, and by extension, government
agencies in general. The appeals court remands the case to Judge Richey to decide the
issue of the dividing line between "agency" records covered by the FRA and
presidential records covered by the Presidential Records Act.
<P>
<B>March 25, 1994</B> - In a brief filed in federal court, the Clinton administration
declares that the National Security Council is not an agency, and should be
accorded the protection from public scrutiny given to the President's personal
advisers. This argument attempts to remove the Clinton administration's White
House e-mail from the reach of FOIA requests and the FRA, arguing that all its
documents are subject only to the Presidential Records Act (PRA) and therefore
not to court oversight.
<P>
<B>December 13, 1994</B> - The e-mail plaintiffs file suit against the Acting Archivist
of the United States to void the Bush-Wilson agreement, in American Historical
Association et. al. v. Peterson.
<P>
<B>February 15, 1995</B> - Judge Richey rejects the Clinton administration's arguments about the NSC's status as "arbitrary and capricious... contrary to history, past practice and the law," and declares that the National Security Council is an
agency. The government subsequently appeals the decision, and the plaintiffs
cross-appeal against a portion of Richey's ruling that opens a loophole for
senior NSC staff giving advice to the President.
<P>
<B>February 27, 1995</B> - In a separate opinion in the lawsuit over the Bush-Wilson
agreement, Judge Richey declares the agreement "null and void," writing that "No
one, not even a President, is above the law." The New York Times subsequently
editorializes, under the headline "A Special Place in History for Mr. Bush," that
"No President has the right to corner official records in an effort to control
his place in history." (March 1, 1995, page A18)
<P>
<B>September 8, 1995</B> - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit hears oral arguments in the case on the issue of Judge Richey's decision
and the agency versus Presidential status of the NSC.

<H2>ask kitty</H2>

    Our life-advice columnist has just returned from Prague where she was helping someone battle through the maze of conscious identity, willed identity, unconscious identity, familial identity, identity as perceived by others, temporal  and geographic identity; and the generic identities of class, race, peer, professional, linguistic and national identities.
   You got a question, bub?
    It'll be a piece of cake. Send your questions to<A HREF="MAILTO:missy@coil.com"> ask kitty</A>.
<BR>
<hr>
<BR>


<font size=+3>q.</font>I'm getting married.  I want a bridal party but don't want my friends to have to buy stupid  dresses  they'll only wear once.  Is it bad form to ask them all to wear little black dresses?   That's my choice.<br>
<font size=+3>a.</font> Then go for it.  If you want to have some autonomy in your married life, now's the time to start.  If you let your worries about what everyone will think determine how you plan this public celebration of your love for each other -- not to mention what will probably be the biggest (if not only) party you will throw in your adult life -- then look out when your married relationship starts to define itself. 
<p>
It's hard enough to understand who you are with another person without having to look through all the veils of the expectations of outsiders.  And besides, if you are happy with the way your celebration of commitment goes, others will be glad to be a part of your joy.  And your friends will thank you for not making them pay gobs of money to look silly. 

 <P>
<font size=+3>q.</font> I'm right and the world's wrong; why should I be polite with fools?<br>
<font size=+3>a.</font>Be polite to everyone, lest you be found out the fool.
<p>
<font size=+3>q.</font> How much fat is in a Big Mac?<br>
<font size=+3>a.</font>If you need to ask, you probably don't want to know.
<P>
<font size=+3>q.</font> How do I tell a co-worker that it would be good for morale if he'd only shower?<br>
<font size=+3>a.</font>Don't.
<p>
<font size=+3>q.</font>I've been too busy all my life for books, and now know I've missed some things.  With what books would you start?<br>
<font size=+3>a.</font>It depends on what you want.  If you want to impress your friends and colleagues (or yourself, for that matter), you can pick up lists of what this person or that thinks is "important" to have read, then plow through the lists, book after book.  But if you want to experience the joy that reading books can give you, the main thing is to like reading.  Like sports?  Read sports books.  Mysteries?  Go for it. 
<P>

Let reading transport you to places and times and realms of being you never thought possible.  Every time you pick up a book, let it be like a little vacation.  When you get the hang of it, try reading some of the books you were supposed to read for school, but only got through <I>Cliffs Notes</I>.  You will be surprised at what a good read <I>The Scarlet Lette</I>r is.  And when you're feeling really good about it, try it with a friend.

<H3>'Homeboys' Launched</H3>
  "Homeboys in Outer  Space," the new half-hour science fiction comedy focusing on the inter-galactic antics of spacemen Tyberious Walker (Flex) and Morris Clay (Darryl  M. Bell), two brothers from Earth, begins production today at The Walt Disney Studios. The series premiered, August 27, and runs weekly at 8:30 P.M. (ET/PT) on UPN.
    <p> Rhona Bennett, Paulette Braxton, Kevin Michael Richardson and  "Star Trek's" James Doohan ("Scotty") in the recurring role of Pippen,  also star in this out-of-this-world comedy series, produced by Sweet Lorraine Productions in association with Touchstone Television.
    <p> The series is set in the 23rd century, where our heroes, Ty and Morris, are combing the galaxies in their Space Hoopty (a cross  between a space shuttle and a 1964 Chevrolet Impala), looking for odd jobs  and loose change.  On board their vehicle is a computer with a back-in-your-
face personality named Loquatia (Bennett).  Loquatia has a crush on Morris causing her circuit boards to melt whenever he comes near,  but she has nothing but electrical shocks for Ty.
<p>  The guys' base of operation is the Jupiter Too, a bar run by Vashti, the Vognarian
(Richardson). In addition to assorted aliens in all shapes  and  sizes,
one of their companions is the ravishing Amma (Braxton), a space
mercenary for whom no mission is impossible -- for the right price.

<h3>Chris and Matt Hit the Road</h3>
Chris Farley and Matthew  Perry  will star in "Edwards and Hunt: The First American Road Trip," a comedy  about a mismatched pair of 19th c. frontiersmen who lead a bumbling  expedition on the ultimate race to explore the wild West.  Principal  photography began recently in northern California on this Turner Pictures Production directed by Christopher Guest and produced by Denise Di  Novi. Written by Mark Nutter, Tom Wolfe and Boyd Hale, the film also  stars
Eugene Levy, Bokeem Woodbine, Lisa B. and Parker Posey.
<p>
     Americans celebrate the intrepid explorers Lewis & Clark, but  how many remember their rivals Edwards and Hunt? Now for the  first  time, the unwritten history of these boldly incompetent patriots can be  told as Edwards and Hunt battle animals, Indians and the elements in a hilarious struggle to become the first American explorers to map a  route to the Pacific Ocean.
<p>
     Unprepared and ill equipped to embark on this voyage, they are  aided by a rag-tag entourage including:  Guy Fontenot (Eugene Levy), a Frenchman with a fluent mastery of indigenous languages he can  never seem to understand; Shaquinna (Lisa B.), his beautiful Native  American
traveling partner; as well as an unruly assortment of colorful  misfits. "Edwards and Hunt: The First American Road Trip" is produced by Denise Di Novi whose numerous credits include "Batman Returns" and "Little Women."
<p>
       A tall tale about forgotten lore, chivalry, and how the West was lost, "Edwards and Hunt: The First American Roadtrip" will be released nationwide by New Line Cinema in 1997.

<h3>'Shut Up Bitch'</h3>

 First seen in 1993 in Vancouver, Canada, "Shut Up Bitch" proved to be a sellout hit, with C.B.C. remarking "at  the  end  of  the  show,  people are on their feet cheering." In  the  spring  of  1996,  it  was  nominated for three (and won two) Jessie Awards.  This  comedy by Michelle Porter explores the silencing of women throughout his-story and uses song and humor to provoke laughter and thought.  It gallivants through historical times while pointing  a  satirical  finger  at  our  own cultural biases. <b>george jr.</b>'s first field trip, in which we loaded a bus with 43 people and headed to West Hollywood, took it in and ate it up.

<h3>MGM Has Rights to 'Julip'</h3>

<h3>Ellen Considers Becoming Interesting</h3>

 Production has begun on the fourth season of the hit comedy, "Ellen," starring award-winning  Ellen DeGeneres in her namesake role. The series, which airs Wednesdays at  8:00  PM (ET/PT) an ABC, first premiered March 29, 1994 and, in its first three seasons, was a consistent winner of its timeslot.
   <p>   "It's time Ellen Morgan finds out who Ellen Morgan is," says DeGeneres  of the upcoming season.  "She's going to grow up and re-examine what is important to her."
   <p>  Ellen makes a move that surprises everyone when she seeks out a new Southern California dwelling and puts her bookstore up on the market, and <b>george jr.</b> is interested in buying it.  Feeling the direct effects of Ellen's personal temblor are her friends Paige  (Fisher) and Audrey (Lewis) but especially Joe (Higgins) and Spence (Piven), who  stand to lose their job and apartment, respectively. Gosh. We're really, really excited.

 <h3>F Musicfest To Be Held October 3-5 </h3>

  
Heralding the ninth  anniversary of its annual music convention, Concrete Marketing has announced  an expanded format for the upcoming 1996 confab.  Concrete's  Foundations
Forum (well known by its informal title, the "Concrete  Convention") will present, along with its usual events, a showcase of over  150  bands in 15 venues. The newly christened F Musicfest is scheduled  to  take place October 3, 4, and 5 in Hollywood.
  <p>   The  expanded 1996 format will make the F  Musicfest  the first music event of its scope ever held in Los Angeles.
  <p>   Featuring showcases by signed and unsigned artists from  across  the country (three times as many performances as in previous years),  the forum will encompass all genres of rock music, including  aggressive post-modern rock, cutting-edge trip hop, grass roots pop -- and,  of
course, plenty of hard-hitting music for which Concrete  is  justifiably famous.
    <p> Reflecting the F Musicfest's diversity, Concrete has  enlisted  L.A.'s renowned Goldenvoice to promote showcases in a variety of venues, including The Roxy, The Whiskey, The Palace, The Troubadour, Jack's Sugar Shack, The Coconut Teaszer, The Union, Post 43, Moguls,  Billboard  Live,
The Viper Room, The Dragonfly, Martini Lounge, Hell's Gate and  the American Legion Hall. Once again, Concrete has joined  forces  with  Kevin Lyman Productions (well known for his work with Lollapalooza and  the Warped tours) for his invaluable production expertise.
    <p> With its numerous artists and venues, the 1996 F Musicfest  will  be the first city-wide music event to be held in the  recording  industry's Los Angeles home turf. Other U.S. cities have  presented  well-known events -- e.g. New York City's New Music Seminar and the annual  South  By Southwest convention in Austin, TX -- but until now, Los Angeles  has never hosted a musical convention of this size and breadth.

American Social History Project historians Roy Rosenzweig, Steve Brier, Josh Brown, and their colleagues have hand-crafted an interactive guide that takes the reader behind the printed page and back in time into the lives of the ordinary men and women who built America. This crucial period of industrial and urban growth, immigration, labor unrest, political conflict, and reform is brought to life through film clips, music, images, and extensive printed
material.
<p>
   WHO BUILT AMERICA? includes more than four and a half hours of audio (oral history, actuality sound, and music), forty-five minutes of archival film, over five thousand pages of historical documents, and more than seven hundred pictures, as well as dozens of graphs, maps, and many other features.

<b>Hey, Break This</b>
    Another goodie we like is Grolier's 1966 GUINESS MULTIMEDIA DISC OF RECORDS, which presents some 15,000 - we counted - challenging feats ever performed by humans, as well as popular cultural stats, animal antics and the natural wonders of the world.
<p>
   This baby uses video sequences, photos and animation to help users experience the record-breaking moments. Based on what we've seen, we're picking the razor-tooth piranha as the team critter. Cost is about $15.95.

<p><hr width=75%><P>
<b>Comic Book 'Confidential' No More</b>
   Ron Mann's hip, funny, and highly acclaimed documentary gives comic books the respect they have long deserved in this second cool Voyager CD-Rom ($49.95). The only comprehensive documentary of comics and their creators ever made, COMIC BOOK CONFIDENTIAL combines interviews, historical footage, animations, and montages of comic art to produce a thoroughly entertaining account of the history of comics. 
<p>
The CD-ROM presents the film along with more than 100 pages of comics art, introductions and biographies of each artist, and a bibliography of their published works. Featured artists include Stan Lee, R. Crumb, Sue Coe, Art Spiegelman, Lynda Barry, Jack Kirby, and William Gaines.

<B>Welcome!</B><br>
       . . .  to the October issue of <B>george jr.</B>, the internet monthly that is not Halley's Comet, not the color orange, not the idea blue. Neither are we a pumpkin pie, nor <I>George Magazine</I>, nor <B>George C. Scott</B>, nor a building with a beanie propeller on top. We are not<B> George Bush</B>, nor are we <B>Boy George.</B>
<br clear=all>
<blockquote>
   We are the literary monthly named after me - that would be george jr.  - and are we ever so glad to bring you another digitized serving of fiction, interviews with authors (<B>Rafael Yglesias</B> and  <B>Carol Anshaw</B>) , Web and entertainment news (updated each Sunday in National Public Rodeo), advice in the call-and-response of Ask Kitty, all things weighted and measured in weights & measures, and several wordy things in the joy of lex.
<P>
   You're about to meet artist <B>Linda Leviton</B>, writers <B>Stanley Crawford </B>and <B>Lynne Sharon Schwartz</B>; and we tip our muskrat-lined derby  to <B>george jr</B>. correspondents<B> Nicholas</B>  'The Keyboard' <B>Basbanes</B> and this month's over-the-transom contributor <B>Joseph</B> 'Shotgun'  <B>Blankenship.</B>
<p>

<B>Catching up</B><br>
    Since  last we met here on this editor's page, the official Web site of the 32nd <!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A href="http://www.planetchess.com/">World Chess Olympiad</A> opened  (sooner or later we had to refer to chess, don't you think?), Saga Furs of Scandinavia says People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (speaking of our embalmed muskrat) dropped its lawsuit against Saga, the world's largest fur marketeers; and A&M Records<B> Chairman Cafaro</B> responded to Wal-Mart's decision to not stock the Sheryl Crow's self-titled second album, <B>Sheryl Crow</B>. (How dare she use her name!)
<P>       "Sheryl has my complete and total support," said A&M's chairman.  "In their decision not to carry Sheryl Crow's latest release, Wal-Mart is choosing  guns over music.  Sheryl Crow's song, <I>Love Is A Good Thing</I>, is a cautionary tale. Everyday in America, children are dying by guns bought legally. This  is  a fact.  What is an appropriate response to this fact?  Where does our responsibility lie? Sheryl's responsibility as an artist is to  reveal  the truth, and it is our responsibility as a record company to defend her  ability to do so. Wal-Mart has no apparent interest in discussing  such  things.  They choose to preempt the dialogue by banning music which may provoke a discussion."
 <p>

<B>Urgent updates</B>
<br>        Also since we last met,  the Macarena died having been bumped  off byThe Miller Tongoneo,  matching hip-swinging moves to the song <I> El Tongoneo.</I> The song is from the Latino  group Mestizzo that  made<I> La Macarena</I> a hit.
<p>   Of course, Mestizzo has sold out. In September it teamed up with Miller Brewing Company to promote  national dance contest to beer  drinkers "of legal drinking age at dance clubs." The group's song is officially referred to as the Miller Tongoneo. Now, shall we get on with <b>the Miller george jr.?</b>
<p>   And, since we last met, no one yet has used in a sentence the word<B> pluvial </B>(plu.vi.al \'plu:-ve--*l\ aj [L pluvialis, fr. pluvia rain, fr. fem. of pluvius rainy, fr.] pluere to rain - more at FLOW 1a: of or relating to rain 1b: characterized by abundant rain of a geologic change  2: resulting from the action of rain), which we find a darn dry shame.
<p>    We've studied the planet for a month, looking high and low for rain,  and found that, yes, it's true,  New York would not have encountered modern art when it did had it not been for the caricatures of a Mexican artist and writer named<B> Marius de Zayas</B> (1880-1961).
<p>   We found, too,  that  the Broadcast Information Bureau  finally has its 1996-97 <I>Interactive Sourcebook </I> available. The new reference CD-ROM,  produced with the Interactive Services Association, lists 6,237 Internet and interactive media executives at 4,690 companies throughout North America. According to  <I>Sourcebook</I>  publisher <B>Ned Borowsky</B>, the ROM will save its users hours of research  and runaround time.
<p>    "Click and connect is how we describe it," says Borowsky, almost echoing <B>E.M.  Forster</B>. "With  just  a couple of clicks of a mouse, the Source book CD-ROM gives our customers  every name, address, phone and fax number they want in seconds." So much for this oddly placed, seemingly commercial plug.
<p>

<B>The  boulevardiers</B>
 <br>   Mythologies have continued to spring up around <B>Stephen King</B>,  who in the last half-minute published 623 novels, 68 books of other sorts and who just sold, only yesterday, 87 million copies of his books. Myths spring up around every wildly successful writer, just as they did around <B>Robert Johnson</B>.
   <p> Mythologies emerge around the unsuccessful ones, too. The only folks who get no mythologies are average folks like you, <B>Bob</B>; or you, <B>Roberta</B>, who will always have a home here with the rest of us <B>george jr.</B> boulevardiers.
<p>

<B>Hypered out</B>
<br>  On Nov. 1, Simon & Schuster will release <I>The Spot: The Book</I> based on the episodic <!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A href="http://www.thespot.com">Web site</A>. What has this so-called culture come to? Well, <I>Clicking In: Hot Links to a Digital Culture</I> (Bay Press), with <B>John Perry Barlow, Sherry Turkle, Sandy Stone</B> and others, for another. And the superior <I>Tolstoy's Dictaphone: Technology and the Muse</I> (Graywolf), edited by <B>Sven Birkerts</B>; and<I> HotWired</I> editor<B> Martha Baer</B>'s novel about Web love, <I> As Francesca</I>, due in January. We like books about real, non-virtual writing better, but until all of<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A href="http://www.feedmag.com/95.09guyer/95.09guyer_sample1.html"> this</A> becomes an either/or deal, we'll fairly consider the latest medium.
 <p>  Hypertext  fiction  pioneer  <B>Bobby  Rabyd</B>, meanwhile,  has extended the scope of publishing a tad with the release of <!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A href="http://www.sonicnet.com/sunshine69/">Sunshine '69</A>. The Internet-based novel incorporates  text, pictures and sound to create what the author  Calls,  "a  Web-based time  machine"  that  allows the reader to explore and contribute prose to the open-ended tale.
 <p>   "No one has grasped the nature  of  this  new  thing  called  the  'Net  with  more  supple- minded alacrity than the writer  Bobby  Rabyd,"  said  <B>Robert  Coover</B>,  the  noted  hypertext proponent and English professor at Brown University, who  served  as  editor  for  the  work.
 <p>  Ah, alacrity: That's so much who <B>george jr.</B> is that we've named this month's issue the cheerful readiness issue.
    <p>

   We're game for this and so much more. Are we in cahoots?
   Have fun.

<h3>carol anshaw:  making her move</h3>

<P>

<IMG SRC="/october/anshaw.jpg" WIDTH=110 HEIGHT=168 HSPACE=15 ALIGN=left>
<br>
  Carol Anshaw's career kicked into gear with the publication four years ago of <i>Aquamarine</i>, which won the Carl Sandburg Award and the Society of Midland Authors Book Award. Houghton Mifflin hopes to follow that success with its publication of Anshaw's  latest novel, <i>Seven Moves</i> ($21.95) , a psychological thriller in which a therapist wakens one morning and finds her paramour mysteriously gone.
   The interview:
<br clear=all>
<hr width=80%>
<blockquote>
<font size=5>q. </font> Your last novel, <I>Aquamarine,</I> featured an unusual construction - giving a single character three parallel lives.  Does  <I>Seven Moves</I> also
bend the form in some way?
<br><font size=5>a.  </font>No, I wanted to work with a straightforward narrative this time.  I'd become interested in novels that were both serious fiction and at the same time compelling stories - a rare species, the literary page-turner, and I wanted to try my hand at creating one.
   Also, I'd seen a lot of books about people who go missing, but not much about
the people they leave behind.  If someone you love suddenly disappeared, this
would, I think, push you onto the hardest ground of your self, and I wanted to explore this constellation of event and emotion.
<p>
<font size=5>q. </font> So, who's your missing person?
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font>Her name is Taylor Heyes.  She's a travel photographer and a rather elusive character even when she is around.  But the book really focuses on her lover, Christine Snow.  The two women have been together four years.
 They share a house, a dog, a life.  Chris is a therapist with a busy private practice - mostly lesbians and gay guys, but also a small group of straight Hispanic women, who are devoted to Chris even though she's bewildered by them.
When Taylor suddenly disappears one morning, after a small domestic
disagreement, Chris is completely thrown.  She doesn't know what to feel - anger, fear, rejection?  Has her partner met with some terrible fate, or simply abandoned her?  If she has left on her own, in the middle of what Chris thought was a life together they were both engaged in, what does that say about her understanding of soul or psyche?  Her confidence is shaken on personally and professionally.  If she has been so deluded about her own life, how can she presume to counsel others?
<p>
<font size=5>q.</font> Does Taylor come back?
<br>
<font size=5>a.</font> I'll duck that question, but not because the book is a mystery.  When I wrote it, I thought of it as an anti-mystery.  Taylor turning up or not becomes less important than the discoveries about her and their relationship that Chris makes, along with discoveries about herself.
<p>
<font size=5>q.</font>  Why did you make the main characters gay women?
<br>
<font size=5>a.</font>  Well, it's the world I live in, and one I feel has been under chronicled.  I tried to create a sort of panoramic view of contemporary, urban lesbian life - show how we're very much like straight people, and also quite different.
<p>
<font size=5>q.</font>  Is the book autobiographical then?
<br><font size=5>a.</font>  Not really.  I think I'd try memoir if I wanted to write about my own life.  But all novelists bring into their work the world as they see it, people as they've overheard them, notions that intrigue them.  By setting the book in Chicago, in my own milieu, and addressing issues of intimacy, isolation and loss that have come up in my own life, I feel more vulnerable and exposed with this book than with Aquamarine, in which I created a protagonist quite unlike myself living lives very different from my own.
<p>
<font size=5>q. </font> How long did it take you to write <I>Seven Moves</I>?
<br><font size=5>a. </font> About three years, but I can't write all the time.  Sometimes I get questions like "Do you write in the mornings or the afternoons?"  Which seems to presume a much more orderly life than mine.  The truth is I write whenever I can between the thousand things I have to do to buy the time to write.
    I get the impression a lot of people think novelists live on huge advances easy-to-get grants and nutritious canapes they take home from literary cocktail parties, when if fact most of us have to teach and/or take on a lot of prosaic writing or editing jobs.  I've edited several deadly business books, and written everything from movie and restaurant reviews, to an articles on collectors of fascinating things like barbed wire, to mock trials with fairy tale characters in the witness box, to teen vampire novels.  It's really only when I get the last stake plunged into the heart of the last Undead teenager that I can turn to my own work.
<p>
<font size=5>q. </font> How did you become a novelist in the first place?<br>
<font size=5>a. </font> My mother tells me I tried to write my first book when I was six, but
didn't know enough words, kept bugging her until she told me to stop and wait
until I learned more.  I came to writing through reading.  My parents weren't
educated and so had no way of guiding me.  I'd just go to the library, look
for titles I liked, bring home these stacks of books.  And since they were
novels, that's what I wanted to write.
    That's basically where I jumped in, I didn't really bother with stories, just started writing novels.  I was really in a cave by myself during this time, through my 20s.  I had little in the way of formal education, didn't know anyone who wrote fiction.  I just kept reading and writing, teaching myself as I went along.  Now that I have a
belated MFA and teach in two graduate programs (at Vermont College and the
School of the Art Institute of Chicago), I can see how these can leapfrog a
writer over a lot of the technical problems I labored with for years.  But
the solitary nature of my own development did, I think, give me a way of
writing that isn't quite like anyone else's.  That's what I gained from my
time in the wilderness.
<p>
<font size=5>q. </font> What are you working on now?<br>
<font size=5>a. </font> I have the beginnings of a new novel in mind, also a short story titled "The Mystery of the Jungle Airstrip," which isn't a mystery and doesn't feature either a jungle or an airstrip.

<h3>rafael yglesias: on the evil that men do</h3>

<P>
<IMG SRC="/october/drneruda.jpg" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=176 HSPACE=15 ALIGN=left>

  Novelist Rafael Yglesias dropped out of high school and wrote his first novel, <I>Hide Fox, And All After</I> (1972) at age 16. Since then, he's published seven more novels, including Fearless (1993) and his latest, <I>Dr. Neruda's Cure for Evil,</I> which has been optioned by 20th Century Fox.
  He has lived in New York City all his life, and comes from a family of writers. His father, Jose, who died last year, published 11 books; his mother, Helen, six; his half brother, Lewis, four. His half sister, Tamar, is a playwright.

<blockquote>
<font size=5>q. </font>What  was  the  impetus  for  writing  about  a  psychiatrist  in  <I>Dr. Neruda's Cure for Evil?</I>
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font>There were two. First, the  premise  of  traditional  psychotherapy,  the  "talking
cure," is  an  almost  mystical  belief  in  the  power  of  the  mind  and   imagination:
namely that  one   person,   doing   nothing   more   substantial   and   dramatic   than
listening and speaking, is able to cure  another  person  of  illness.  That's  an  excellent setting for a psychological novelist. Second, because I  wanted  to  write  about  the effect of the collapse of ideas in the 20th century  on  a  brilliant  man  for  whom the need for a philosophy is a matter of life and death.
<p>
<font size=5>q. </font>Ah, life and death. What kind of research did you do?
<br>
<font size=5>a.</font> I asked two therapists, one a psychologist, the other a  psychiatrist,  what  they
read in school to graduate. Eventually I  discovered  that  I  needed  to  read  more  than the basic texts, since  I  wanted  my  doctor  to  be  unusually  open-minded  about  the many schools of psychological theory. Also, since  my  novel  is  intended  to  be read as a "case history," I read case histories.  And,  of  course,  I've  also  been  in therapy.  Altogether,  three  years  of  reading  relatively impenetrable jargon was needed before I felt I could fake a psychiatrist's narration.
<p>
<font size=5>q.</font> You spend all of the book's Part One  on  Rafael's  childhood.  By doing  so,  what  are  you
saying about what a doctor brings to a patient's case?
<br>
 <font size=5>a.</font> There is no escape from the effect, of our early life on our ideas  and  actions
later on. As Neruda writes in the novel: "No one is  stronger  than or  independent
of the people and things that surround him. Ideas are objective, but  their truth is
not the glue that makes them stick to us." For better or worse, a  psychiatrist  brings  a
personality and  personal  history  into  the  room  with  a  patient.  Good  shrinks  know
it and try to compensate; bad ones think they are above it.
<p>
<font size=5>q.</font> I suppose you are sick of talking about your writing family.
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font> Most novelists  are  volunteers;  I  was  drafted.  Most  writers  long  to  become
writers   and often must battle  discouraging  parents.  My  father  believed  writing was the only worthwhile endeavor.

<p>
<font size=5>q.</font> How did you learn how to write?
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font> By  listening  to  my  parents at dinner. I didn't truly decide - for myself - to  be  a writer,  until  well  after  I  had published my first three novels. I stopped writing novels for four years,  discovered I missed it, and resumed in my late twenties.
<p>
<font size=5>q. </font>You, your mother and your father were publishing books simulatneously.
<br>
<font size=5> a. </font>That  was  irritating.  Publishing  a  book is and should be an  individual  achievement.  Instead,  we  were  reviewed  and  discussed  as if we were the Flying Wallendas. The  oddity  of  our  family  achievement  distracted people from hearing our distinct voices.
<p>
<font size=5>q.</font> OK, let's go back to yours. In <I>Dr. Neruda's Cure for  Evil</I>,  you  posit  a  diagnosis  and even a  cure  for  evil. How did you come up with it?
<br>
<font size=5> a.</font> Slowly.  During  my  first  year  of  reading  psychological  theory,  it  became
obvious that good and evil create a problem for any systemized analysis of the
human  character.  Definitions  of   good   and   evil   change   dramatically   between
cultures and eras. I also  noticed  that  psychiatry  depends  on  patients  identifying
themselves as ill - either through violent or delusional  behavior - or  by  coming  into
a doctor's office to announce that they  feel  unhappy.  It  occurred  to  me  that  an
individual who wasn't violent or  unhappy - as  sociopaths,  serial  killers,  Nazis  and
so on, are - but who enjoyed hurting or manipulating others,  would  be  invisible  to  a
working psychiatrist. People  who  function  well  and  feel  "good  about  themselves"
only when they harm people, and yet the  harm  isn't  illegal  or  delusional - what  are
they? There's  no  psychological  definition  for  it.  I  decided  it  would  make  an
intriguing drama to put a  serious  psychological  theorist  face  to  face  with  this
unknown.
<p>
<font size=5>q. </font>How did you develop the idea of evil into the novel?
<br>
<font size=5> a.</font> By having Neruda's  treatment  of  Gene - a  technically  successful  example.  of
psychotherapy - end  in  a  catastrophe,   namely   Gene   murdering   his   wife   and
committing suicide. Such a result would be inexplicable to Neruda  and  force  him  to
investigate. Again, while researching therapy, I noticed one  of  its  oddities,  namely
that the psychiatrist (in theory) never meets the people who are so  important  to  the
patient. For a novelist this provides a fascinating narrative. First the reader  hears
about Hally and Stick solely from Gene. Then,  with  all  of  Gene's  "information,"  we
meet them again, this time through Neruda's eyes. It is  the  shock  of  his  discovery,
this journey into the "real world," that gives Neruda the clarity to come  up  with  his
diagnosis of evil.
<p>
<font size=5>q. </font>What else are you toiling on?<br>
 <font size=5>a.</font> I  am  adapting  <I>Dr.  Neruda's  Cure  for Evil</I>  for Amy Robinson   and   Joe
Ruben to  produce  for  20th  Century  Fox.  I  recently  adapted  Victor  Hugo's   <I>Les
Miserables</I>  (not  the  musical)  for  Mandalay  Entertainment.  Gillian Armstrong   is
signed to direct, but we're not cast yet. After that script, I plan to  write  my ninth
novel, which will be about a long and happy marriage.

<h3>Rosalyn Drexler:  from <i>Art Does (Not!) Exist </i></h3>

<P>

  <i>Art Does (Not!) Exist </i>(FC2, $19.95) is Drexler's 1996 novel about Julia Maraini, an artist  and writer in her 20s who is involved in video and other new media, and writing a book, and who is plainly down on her luck. Her husband is gone, but threatens to return; and her apartment on the Lower East Side, near SoHo, burns down under suspicious circumstances.

This book will help me decide which project to present for an NEA Fellowship in Visual Arts-Based Performance, Video, and new genres. At the moment my life is in flux. I'm doing nothing. How can I? My heavy equipment is in storage. I don't have a place to live. My funds are at an all time low. And my nutty husband wants me back. I'm thinking of putting myself in storage, but there's no lock on the inside. As Clov, one of Beckett's characters says in Endgame, (pause) "I can't be punished any more." He waited for the end of the play to leave. I'm already gone. What does it all mean?
<p>
THE MEANING OF LIFE
<p>
ONCE AS I STOOD UPON A HILL OBSERVING A STARLESS, INKY VISTA, IT WAS SUDDENLY REVEALED TO ME THAT LIFE WAS NOT A FOUNTAIN, BUT A FOUNTAIN PEN. I WAS AMAZED BECAUSE IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT LIFE COULD BE A FOUNTAIN, MUCH LESS A FOUNTAIN PEN. IF ANYONE HAD BOTHERED TO ASK ME I WOULD HAVE TOLD THEM THAT LIFE IS MORE LIKELY TO BE A RUSTY U-SHAPED SEWAGE PIPE JOINING HEAVEN AND EARTH, SAME AS "NUT", A PRIMORDIAL GODDESS OF THE SKY WHOSE PROFOUND FEAT ALLOWED THE SOULS OF THE DEAD TO ASCEND TO HEAVEN. AS FOR FOUNTAIN PENS, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THEY ARE ERRONEOUSLY LABELED, BEING NEITHER FOUNTAINS OF KNOWLEDGE NOR ANY OTHER KIND OF FOUNTAIN. IN THE HANDS OF GENIUS, OF COURSE, THEY CAN BESTOW ETERNAL LIFE--BUT ONLY TO WORDS. THIS IS THE TRUTH. ANYWAY, AS MOTHER GOOSE, MY REVERED #1 GURU, ONCE WROTE ON HER ANCIENT COMPUTER:
<br>
FOR EVERY EVIL<br>
UNDER THE SUN<br>
THERE IS A REMEDY<br>
OR THERE IS NONE<br>

<p>
MY SITUATION<br>
<p>
I'M LOOKING FOR A CHEAP APARTMENT ON THE<br>
LOWER EAST SIDE (NYC). MY LIFESTYLE HAS BECOME<br>
SO ERRATIC (SOMETIMES I STAY UP ALL NIGHT EDITING TAPES OR WRITING) THAT I FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO<br>
LIVE WITH ANYONE ELSE OR TO SHARE AN APARTMENT. I NEED SPACE AND QUIET. SAFETY, FORGET IT. I WATCH<br>
MY ASS, NOTICE WHO'S AROUND. WHAT MORE CAN I DO?<br>

COMMENT<br>
<p>
I USED TO HAVE MORE FUN.<br>
<p>
LOOKING FOR AN APARTMENT:<br>
TIME TO GET SERIOUS
<p>
An ad in the Real Estate section of the Sunday Times describes what I am looking for: furnished apartment, low rent.... I call the landlord, make an appointment to see the place. It's not far from Chinatown, near SoHo. We meet in front of the building.
<p>
"You're on time," the landlord says, "shows you're a responsible person."
<p>
"Yeah I've been accused of that before."
<p>
I follow him down a few stone steps to the basement entrance. A rusted iron gate stands open. We go in. Takes a while for my eyes to adjust to the dark. What I make out is a large space divided by a column: I point to an empty space to the left of the column where one might put a bed, then to a small alcove over which a bare bulb hangs. The landlord pulls on the light cord and the dim 40-watt bulb flickers on then off again. The floor below the bulb is scraped, as if a heavy table had been dragged across it.
<p>
"Where's the table?" I ask the landlord. His name, Stan Baltimore, is on the card he hands me.
<p>
"You take the place I'll get you a table," he says, "maybe even a bed."
<p>
 It occurs to me that Stan Baltimore would like to screw me. The way he says "bed." The way his hand brushes my arm when he talks. So what else is new; if I play along, flirt a little, maybe I can get him to give me a good deal on the place. It's not perfect, but it'll do.
<p>

INNER THOUGHTS

(unless otherwise designated, all dialogue with a Q or A before it, is to be understood as what I am thinking)
<p>
<font size=5>q:</font> Are you willing to sleep on a used mattress?
<br>
<font size=5>a:</font> A used mattress can be dangerous territory, harboring bugs--stains of an intimate nature--unexpected protuberances -- indentations--odors. A friend of mine (Juan Ferra) burns the mattresses he finds in empty lots in order to exhibit them as art. He calls his art: "Mattress World" (Not to be confused with Dial-A-Matres ((Leave off the second s for savings)). Juan devoutly believes that there is nothing, no matter how broken or dirty, that cannot not be reclaimed as art.
"But one has to be careful," he says, displaying a badly burned hand, "not to get too close--the work and the artist must remain separate: art can kill the artist as surely as the artist can kill the art."
<p>
GOD I'M TIRED. I'D BE BETTER OFF IN BED
<p>
<font size=5>q:</font> Have you inspected this apartment?<br>
<font size=5>a:</font> Why do you ask?
<p>
<font size=5>q:</font> Remember to run the water in the tap; washers wear out. Landlord should replace. Look for signs of illegal entry: chipped paint on the door jamb beside the lock. Is a dead bolt necessary? Where is the telephone jack? If there is none, will there be an additional charge for installation?
<p>
There are suspicious holes in the wall beside the door. Perhaps shots were fired...somehow connected to an item in the news: ANGRY HUSBAND SHOOTS WIFE! Where? Manhattan family court. As wife sits on bench in hall outside of courtroom, the husband writes a note and hands it to her. Wife tears it up. (Could they have been tenants here? Are the holes all that's left of marital target practise?) BANG, BANG, BANG! BANG, BANG, BANG! Goodbye--exit life! The holes are too small to be bullet holes; more likely they were left there by small nails hammered in to hold pictures. (But why so many? So small? So close together?) Why are these perforations grouped together as if aimed at the heart of a (five-feet-eleven-inches) male with his back pressed to the crumbling plasterboard

<h3>Stelios and His Lost Tomatoes
<br><i> by Vassilis Vassilikos</i></h3>
<IMG SRC="/october/tomato.gif" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=86 HSPACE=15 ALIGN=left>
<P>
<blockquote>
   This is the opening selection to a novel by Vassilis Vassilikos called . . . and dreams are dreams,</i> translated from the Greek by Mary Kitro&#235ff, and published this year by Seven Stories Press.

<blockquote>
For Stelios, the tomatoes in his garden were a consolation. He owned a small plot next to his house, in the suburb of Pefki, where he grew his tomatoes, some zucchini, a little clover, radishes, and a few sweet potatoes. But his tomatoes were his great love. He would see them every morning growing red, like the cheeks of young girls.
<p>It was summer. The deep of summer. July. His wife and daughters were away on vacation, if one could call it that, in Oropos, visiting with an aunt and doing some swimming. Stelios was left on his own. He worked in his taxi and enjoyed his work. He came in contact with people. But his consolation, amidst the smog and traffic jams, was his garden, a substitute for his village, perhaps, which he had left while still a child in order to emigrate first to Belgium and then, a few years ago, to Athens.
<p>He hadn't regretted coming back to his country. There were the children to consider. He was afraid Belgian society, with its drugs, would corrupt his girls. With the money he had saved up all those years he worked in Spa, he built his little house in Pefki and got his own taxi.
<p>Next to the house (built without a license) was his little garden. He had bought the land with his wife's cousin, since he couldn't afford to buy it on his own, and the cousin had built a house next to his. They were separated by the garden.
<p>But the garden belonged to him. That had been determined from the start. Since then, two years had gone by. He didn't have much to do with the cousin, who had turned out to be a man of bad faith. Misunderstandings over a few meters of land, while they were both illegally building their homes, caused a rift between them. But he was Stelios's wife's cousin, not a stranger. Stelios swallowed his anger. Which is why he started having stomach trouble.
<IMG SRC="/october/weed.gif" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=235 HSPACE=15 ALIGN=right>
<p>"We don't always get along very well with the neighbors," he would explain.
<p>But it gave his wife a sense of security to have a relative nearby. His wife, sweet Merope, had worn herself out in Spa all those years, working at the mineral water bottling plant. It was hard work for her and for Stelios too, who had worked at a factory that made car parts.
<p>In any case, things weren't too bad. But today there had been a disaster. And the taxi driver vented his anger on his unknown customer. Namely, me.
<p>"I got home in the afternoon. I had been working all morning. All morning I had been dreaming of the salad I was going to make myself, since the old lady and the girls are away at Oropos, with the tomatoes from my garden. They had ripened to perfection. I was going to fry myself a couple of eggs and have a snack. So I go home, and I find they've been picked. It made me mad. It still does."
<p>"Was it burglars?" I asked.
<p>"Burglars? Since when do burglars steal tomatoes?"
<p>"Then who stole them?"
<p>"Who? Even if I told you, what would it mean to you? But it makes me mad. And it makes me even madder because I can't tell him. I know who it was. It was him that did it. My wife's cousin. My neighbor. Only he could get into my garden."
<p>That was when I learned about the house, about their not getting along, and all the rest of it.
<p>"And why don't you just go straight to him and tell him?"
<p>"And what good would that do, my dear man? It's done. The tomatoes are gone. But I tell you, it made me mad. I couldn't wait to get home to go into the garden and pick them, they were so red and plump, like little watermelons, organically grown, and I didn't find a single one. He had picked the exact four that I was going to pick. The others are still green."
<p>As he drove me to the offices of my newspaper (The Almanac of Dreams), I could see that the man at the wheel was truly suffering. I was filled with pity for this "pavement ship owner" (as they mockingly refer nowadays to taxi drivers because of their meager earnings), and I wanted to show him my compassion.
<p>"Listen," I said. "To keep it all inside is no good. It doesn't set you free. You have to let it out. You're only human, you need to get things off your chest. You told me about it, but I'm a stranger. Soon I'll be gone, you may tell it again to someone else. I don't want it to stop there: I want you to do something about it."
<p>From what I gathered, if he were to mention the tomatoes to his cousin, the discussion wouldn't end there. It would spread over into other things: their old feud over the land they had bought together, the disputed two meters of land ("which is exactly how deep they'll bury us both," the taxi driver had remarked wisely). And it might even have gone furtherwho knowsto the village, to the family affairs of his wife, to the fields that her relatives looked after while she was away in Belgium (perhaps the famous cousin was among them), and to her not having been able to claim her share and feeling wronged over it. The tomatoes were the hand grenades that would explode, and their seeds would destroy the good relations of the neighborhood once and for all. Also, Stelios did not want, as he told me frankly, to pick a fight when his wife was away, that she should come home all tanned and renewed, only to find the house turned upside-down.
<p>I began to picture the innocent tomatoes that knew nothing, poor things, of the problem they had caused; that had surrendered themselves without protest to the hand that had stolen them; and that could even have become the cause of a murder. How can one blame a tomato, grown in a garden with affection, turning red with shame like a young girl (in Stelios's case, his own daughters, who grew more and more embarrassed in front of their father as their breasts swelled), and then along comes a vengeful hand and steals them away from the one who raised them with his own sweat and tears?
<p>The street was full of cars. We were moving along with difficulty. It was terribly hot. Like all taxis, this one didn't have air- conditioning. There was ventilation with, supposedly, fresh air, but that too was burning, like the air in the street.
<p>Stelios, lean faced, was smoking at the wheel. I sat in the back seat; we communicated with our eyes through the rear view mirror. I pictured the scene: he comes home to Pefki dripping with perspiration around 3:30 in the afternoon, after earning a hard day's wages, living with the dream of his tomatoes, to have a bite and then lie down, closing the shutters and leaving the windows open to let in fresh air. And then, as he enters his garden, the vegetable garden of his dreams, which he would water and weed in order to relax after a hard day's work at the wheel, among drivers who knew nothing of driving, who were daring, inexperienced, and impudent, waging a battle every day just to avoid being crashed into, he finds among its branches, instead of the red orbs he expects, freshly cut stems.
<p>"The dirty rascal didn't even leave me one single tomato as a consolation prize."
<p>"Couldn't it have been someone else?" I asked.
<p>"There's no way. Nobody can get into the garden or the house, the way I've fenced it. One can only get in from the inside. And from the inside, only my cousin could have done it. He pulled the same stunt on me last year, with two avocados. But my wife covered for him. And I didn't care about the avocados."
<p>How horrible life is, truly! To be condemned to live under a metal roof that is being scorched by the sun, and to dream of a fresh salad, and then for someone to come along and steal it from your plate! But as our discussion progressed, with me in the role of the calming influence, to help the man get it off his chest, I began to discern that the problem was not so much the tomatoes as it was Stelios's fear for his daughters.
<p>This cousin was a bit of a satyr, as I surmised from what Stelios told me about his life and times. The father, who loved his girls, wanted, like every father, to be the first to taste their fruit (which, of course, would never happen, so, to make up for it, he would find them husbands who wouldn't make him jealous). Stelios had come to fear his cousin, his neighbor, who had designs on his girls and wanted to devour them. He had noticed that the cousin was already hungrily eyeing the elder one, who was seventeen and would be finishing high school the following year. He caught that leer of his one afternoon: Mairoula was in the garden hanging out her wash, mostly panties and socks, and the lecherous cousin (a man of thirty-five, swarthy and unsavory) watched from his balcony and undressed her with his eyes. Stelios was weeding his garden and pretended not to see. But as he stooped down, he caught his cousin's eyes lusting for his daughter; as he bent over, the blood rushed to his head. At that moment, he could have taken his hoe and split open his cousin's thick, vulgar head like a rose. But he restrained himself, and he swallowed his anger like he swallowed everything else.
<p>Now Mairoula was almost eighteen, while his younger daughter, prematurely developed, also had the body of a woman, and the cousin surely had his eye on her too. As for Stelios, whether he would lie down with his wife for the kind of lovemaking that had long since been made out of habit and not passion, or whether he would unwind with some low-class prostitute in a brothel, the image of those girls of his dominated his thoughts and made him climax. He would have his girls on his mind, and as he would struggle to chase those thoughts away the girls would come to him and caress him tenderly with their hands. At night, before going to bed, they would beg him to be the first man to sleep with them, which would disturb Stelios terribly and make him ashamed in front of his wife; he thought everybody knew about his fantasy and so he would ignore his daughters, and his wife would reprimand him for not being an affectionate father. His daughters thought he had stopped loving them, even though they hadn't done anything to upset him.
<p>Mairoula was a serious girl and a good student; she was going to study physics and math at the university. The younger one, with the nice figure, was a talented dancer and attended a ballet school in Pefki (one of the many dance schools that shot up like mushrooms when Fame started playing on TV every Sunday evening). They had never caused him any trouble. Born in Belgium, having lived there for fifteen years, they stood apart from their Greek-born classmates, who were vain and precocious, who wanted to be "cool" and rebelled against their families. His daughters were serious. In fact the elder one had joined the Communist Youth, where the kids were almost puritanical, growing up with principles in the face of the triple enemy: capitalism-imperialism-Americanocracy.
<p>Yet Stelios's soul had succeeded in discovering the Devil in the face of his wife's cousin, who would bring home the occasional nightclub singer. Many times,toward daybreak, Stelios and his wife could hear the moaning of these women in their very own bedroom. "I have daughters," Stelios would tell his cousin. "At least have a little respect for us." But he, Mr. Tough Guy with the pencil-thin mustache, who, before coming to live next to them, lived in the boondocks, did not share their sensibilities.
<p>I came to realize all this, little by little, as the line of cars moved along with little hops (I was already late), until finally (what an abyss the human creature is!), the significance of the tomatoes acquired within me its true dimension, and I saw that even if it were true that this man, Stelios, had a weakness for his tomatoes, and even if it were true that for him, his garden was a dream amidst his dangerous, paved, polluted life, it was equally true that these tomatoes, in relation to the cousin, signified something else, something much deeper, something that not even he himself realized, and that, were I to reveal it to him, he would have taken me for a lunatic and kicked me out of his taxi without even letting me pay my fare.
<p>But he was suffering, I could see that. The blow had been mortal, and what was worse, he couldn't get it out of his system. The important thing in life is having an escape valve for all poisonous gases. That's all that matters.
<p>Finally, we arrived at the offices of my newspaper. I invited him to come up with me. He wasn't familiar with the paper, but he said he would be glad to subscribe to it, since he might be able, through a dream, to find some temporary relief for his problem.
<p>But Stelios's problem, as the reader must have realized by now, was of the virtually insolvable kind. His being at odds with his neighbor was a constant threat to the serenity of his family. Only if he put up a fence of dreams between the two houses could he find peace. And he would not be able to put up a fence like that, unless it was . . .
"What?" he asked.<p>
"A vine arbor. Nobody will know the real reason you put it up, it will offer you the protection of its foliage and its shade, and it will make it safe for your girls to wander around and your tomatoes to ripen."
<p>
The idea appealed to him.<p>
For there are vine arbor dreams, and dreams on crutches. There are dreams that isolate our spiritual tranquillity inside their immaterial walls, like the noise-absorption walls along busy freeways passing through populated suburbs.

<br><br>
After recently watching the Eagles prevail against the favored Detroit Lions, the person of <B>george jr.</B> deployed to the front steps of his home and began repairing the broken front cement steps.
<P>
  Chip, chip. Caulk, caulk, scrape, scrape - and I was tapped on the shoulder. Surprised, because this shoulder tapper had made no sound, I wheeled and came face to face with the ghost of <B>George Washington Carver</B>, as he introduced himself to me.
<p>     'As you're likely to know,<B> Mr. george jr</B>.,'  there are  farragoes  occurring now worldwide with attorneys and bulks of paperwork and corporations and companies and subsidiaries of fame and fortune all trying to leverage their identities into every household in the world, including yours.'
<p>   'Yes,' I said. 'I know.'
<p>   'Well,' he said, 'I want you to know that you and I have something in common.'
<p>   'Is it that we both have a foot, yours more spectral than mine, in this wet cement?'
<p>   'No,' said the ghost. 'What we have in common is our names.'
<p>   'Ahh,' I said. 'The part that is George.'
<p>  'Yes, that's it,' he said. 'I'd like you to give up yours now, or I'll do something supernaturally painful to you that will rock your wallet and very home.'
<p>   Shocked into a daze, I excused myself from the ghost of the historical personage and went inside to check on the football scores.
<p>   I turned on <B>ABC</B> (or was it <B>NBC</B>?), or maybe it was <B>CBS</B>. And was shocked and alarmed to discover that each of these corporate giants had used a full third of each other's identities in their names: the letter <B>C</B>.
<p>   What was with this letter <B>C</B>?
<p>   Had no one owned it yet? Had all three owned it?
<p>   Why was the letter <B>C</B> so valuable to the United States of America's broadcasting giants that they'd risk confusion among people like me, who never until now had to wonder about who was who and who was not. That <B>C</B> must be some consonant.
<p>   I, too, began to lust for that letter of the alphabet.
<p>   I wondered what other vowels and consonants I might buy or own, in random or tandem with other words and letters, and then flipped to <I>Seinfeld</I> and came face to face with a fictional guy named 'George.'
<p>   Had the ghost of <B>George Washington Carver</B> pressured him, too? Or maybe I should, if there was something to gain by pressuring a guy to give up his name. 'Dear Producers of <I>Seinfeld</I>,' I began my letter, 'immediately quit using the name George in your show, because it's mine.' Well, not precisely mine; it's my father's. Mine, after all, is <B>george jr.</B> So I quit with the letter.
<p>   I turned off the TV and opened the magazines on my nightstand: <I>St. George Magazine</I>, followed by <I>George Realty</I>; and then ordered some funny pet dishes from a pet-novelty company  (very cool catalog) called George.
<p>   <B> George Steinbrenner Jr.</B> is a person, like me, with part of my name. I considered threatening him over his name because, like, well, you know, there was a chance that any money he's earned in his lifetime possibly might have been meant  for me. Somebody might accidentally have sent him a Christmas card, when they were thinking of me - and, come to think of it, I did get one fewer Christmas card last year.
<p>   And then, a tapping at my bedroom window.
<p>   It was the ghost of <B>George Washington Carver</B> again, staring in at me through my bedroom window.
<p>   'Give me your naaaaaaame!,' he moaned, and threatened me for the second time. I picked up my address book and began to throw it at the pane when, miraculously, the book opened to the <B>W</B> page and there, before me, was the Los Angeles address for actor <B>George Wendt</B>.
<p>    I paged rapidly through the book, and there, too, were the Houston address for <B>George Bush</B>; and still other addreses for artist <B>George Segal</B>, musician<B> George Allan Russell</B>, economist <B>George Stigler</B>, journalist <B>George Will</B>, comedian<B> George Carlin,</B> Gov. <B>George E. Pataki Jr.</B>
of the State of New York, Ohio Gov.<B> George E. Voinovich</B>, the mayor of <B>Georgetown</B>, the provost of <B>Georgetown University</B> and - lo and behold - a George for every letter of the alphabet.
   Even <B>C</B>.
<p>   There's that much-coveted letter of the alphabet again.
   And from it, I take <b>C</b>ourage.

<H2>beatific advice: on the upkeep of marriage & house</H2> 
<h3><i>by stanley crawford</i> </h3>
<P>
<blockquote>
 In this excerpt from <i>Some Instructions to My Wife . . .</i>(Dalkey Archive Press, $11.95), Stanley Crawford shows why his book is a classic lampoon of sanctimonius family manuals - especially of the type once so reverred by  the Victorians. The rest of the book's title sets the tone: "Concerning the Upkeep of the House and Marriage, and to My Son and Daughter Concerning the Conduct of Their Childhood."
<hr>
</blockquote>
<center><b>First to My Wife Concerning the Upkeep of the House and Marriage</b>
</center><p>

   As you know,  my dear,  I have taken it upon myself to limit the number of our Children to two, one Son and one Daughter, the greater part of whose care I entrust to your apparently sound maternal instincts. There is little I can offer by way of advice or recommendation except to say that I do not wish to meet them more than once or twice a day and preferably toward the end of the day when they are being put to bed, which is also near the hour I have at last managed  to dismiss most of the greater concerns of the day and thus am able to summon up the strength to once again introduce myself as their Father.
<p>
   They are, at this time in their lives when they are particularly subject to beneficial influences (I am pleased to note) learning. It would help if you would refer to me regularly through the window as I work out in the yard or as I get in the car and drive away, or as I pass close by the house on the way to get a tool from the garage or return one I have finished with. In such manner they will become accustomed to viewing me at various angles and distances, and in various postures, or moving now slowly, now rapidly, on foot or by car. You may now and then (but perhaps no more than once a day) wish to carry them out in your arms so that they may have a close view of me in direct sunlight or, as one of them seems to be walking after a fashion, send him for a brief  ramble down to the garden walls and let him (or her) peer through the cracks in the gate, staring and blinking, before you call him (or her) back.
   And when they are old enough to speak in complete sentences and thus to understand them when spoken to them, you might consider reading them aloud, once a day or so, selections from some of my published horticultural pamphlets, particularly <i>Garlic Questions Finally Answered  and How to Garden Without Bending Over. </i>These things must not be hurried, however. There is plenty of time for the Children to get to know me, and I see no reason why they should be rushed into the matter when all of life is yet ahead of them.
<p>
	Although we will have no more Children  -- we already have 0.3 too many as it is, statistically speaking) it may nonetheless be said that every day lived within the house, thus within the Marriage, is one of utmost pregnancy. For as you go about your way within the house cleaning and dusting, washing clothes and dishes, and I go about my way outside making repairs and tending the yard and garden, we bear within ourselves, the Husband and the Wife, images or effigies of each other, the Husband and of the Wife, the Wife of the Husband, and carry these images about with us as we work. And as the pregnant mother-to-be will have no clear idea of what her future child will look like, or how it will behave, imagine what she will, until it is actually born into the world, so too will neither you nor I have any clear idea of what the other ( with whom we have been pregnant all day ) will look like or how the other will behave until that moment we meet again at the end of the day, in that daily birth or rebirth which is the encounter of the Husband and the Wife in the house and in the Marriage.
    And in this state of unending pregnancy so too must you take care not to eat things that will upset your stomach while at the same time keeping up your breathing exercises, resting when necessary, so that when the moment comes you will be in good physical condition, relaxed and fearless, and able to face the ordeal with the conviction that all will come out well. For to neglect these things in the daily pregnancy of the Marriage is to open oneself to the possibility of not only great pain but the premature or the miscarried as well, in which the image nurtured in pregnancy is too small or is ill formed in comparison with the strapping reality, suddenly strong and overpowering and demanding beyond all preconception.

<H2>gallery:   linda leviton</H2> 
<P>
 
      Mixed-media artist Linda Leviton graduated Summa Cum Laude from the  University of Cincinnati's School of Design, Art and Architecture in 1976. Now living in Columbus, Ohio, Leviton's works have been exhibited in solo and group shows at the Richmond Art Museum in Indiana, the Evansville Museum of Art in Illinois, the Artemisia and Artspace galleries in Chicago and the List visual Arts Center in Cambridge, Mass.
<p>     "Many of my pieces combine copper and brass wire, fabric and wood," she  said. "As medieval alchemists sought to transform base metal into gold, I  seek to do the same with my work."
 <p>   Using discarded materials to represent the 'alchemical process,' she
tries to transform subconscious beliefs and images into the gold of
"meaningful symbols of our experience that speak to us of what is
happening on a spiritual level.''
<p>     "By taking discarded manmade materials and combining them with objects  from nature - stone, bone, gourds - I make whole again things that have  been separated. I breathe new life into these combined materials and transform them into something of value: art."

The New
Press, <b>george jr.</b> is able to bring you, raw and unplugged,

SUBJECT:Persian Gulf
A couple of news items:
 --Bandar is reportedly returning to Washington tomorrow.
 --The GCC had a team in the US last month looking at the Lockheed P-3 as 
a possible surveillance aircraft.  In general, we want to support GCC 
multilateral defense efforts.  Unfortunately, this mission did not go 
well (ISA didn't get apprised of it til the eleventh hour and neither 
Navy nor Lockheed went to much trouble to make it a success).  GCC has 
now reportedly narrowed its search to Dutch or French alternatives.  The 
real issue is need for a PD making GCC eligible to purchase defense goods 
and services, which we don't yet have.  DOD is ready to go but has been 
holding up the paperwork due to their understanding that GCC wants to 
downplay public association with the US.  (Since the PD has to be 
notified to Congress, USG to GCC arms sales would inevitably become 
public).  We ought to be going ahead with the PD, but want to check with 
the GCC first.  GCC Secretary General Bishara is in town next week and 
should pay a call on Armitage, who can be expected to raise the issue 
with him.

NOTE FROM:Howard Teicher
Subject:a-4s for argentina
during the u.s.-u.k. pol-mil talks last week, the brits raised on their 
own initiative u.k. opposition to the transfer or sale of a-4s to 
argentina. [Five lines deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] the meaning of this 
is clear:thatcher is worried about the electoral reprecussions of what 
labor will describe as the u.s. payback for her cooperation.
             
notwithstanding her political problem, which u.k. experts continue to 
credit to economic problems, non-anglophiles in the u.s.g. (i.e. ara 
types, pm types and soviet types) remain convinced that we must find ways 
to strengthen argentina's military and support alfonsin. everyone who 
supports this approach believes the president should discuss the problem 
with{thatcher next month. i would propose the following sequence of 
actions in advance of such a dialogue
  - you and shultz discuss at the end of this week;
  - assuming he agrees it should be put to the president, discuss with 
the president or send decision memo next week;
  - if he agrees to raise it with thatcher, you and shultz could send a 
substantive message to your counterparts advising them      of the 
importance the president attaches to this issue and his intention to 
raise it when he meets with mrs. thatcher; 
  - the bureaucracy will meanwhile develop a game plan for a-4         
modernization and diplomatic initiatives (perhaps to include a u. s. 
commitment to work with alfonsin to bring about an end to hostilities and 
further progress in the political area.
  - thatcher might still say no, forcing the president to decide whether 
to acquiesce or take the measures which most objective observers feel 
best serves our hemispheric interests.

NOTE FROM:Peter Rodman
SUBJECT:European Arms Sales to Iran
  I note in the Sit Room's evening summary the other day a report that 
Genscher is emphasizing that the FRG will not ship arms to either side in 
the Iran-Iraq war.
  I have been worried that the disclosures of our limited arms transfers 
might provide an excuse for several other countries to throw off all 
restraints in permitting such sales (citing US "hypocrisy," etc.) 
However, maybe the uproar will turn out to encourage other governments to 
crack down harder, for fear of inviting similar "scandals" there.  I can 
see the brouhaha in Italy having the same result, for example.
  So -- at least in that respect -- we may not turn out so badly.

NOTE FROM:Howard Teicher
Subj ect:A 4s
i agree with your analysis. the israelis will not quickly find a   way to 
reimburse the argentines, and may even try to force us to eat the costs 
by involving the congress. i continue to believe that we must find ways 
to strengthen argentine democracy with arms transfers, perhaps through 
agreement for a long-term co-production arrangement that would give the 
argentines confidence in our support. but don't look to the israelis for 
relief on this one, especially when we're pushing to kill the lavi.

SUBJECT:Operation Staunch
  Even if we have trouble putting Operation Staunch back together, we can 
at least blow the whistle on the countries that are sending arms 
clandestinely to Iran.
  I note in this morning's INR summary a major new Bulgarian arms 
shipment. (These are John Whitehead's new friends!)
  We should let the Iraqis know of such information when it turns up. 
Perhaps we are already doing so, but in the present environment we should 
make a point of telling the Iraqis what we know.

<H3>Techies/White House E-mail link</H3>

The White House refused to provide any of the e-mail in electronic
form. Rather, White House and other government staff printed out
the specific e-mail messages targetted by the National Security
Archive's Freedom of Information Act requests, then reviewed the
printouts for classified information and privacy issues before
releasing them in hard copy form.
<P>
Ian Stevenson then employed a Hewlett Packard ScanJet IIc/ADF
scanner, together with CAERE optical character recognition
software, to digitize the large stack of White House printouts
selected for this disk. The typographical errors, run-on
sentences, bad grammar, colloquial language and other questionable
matters found here are all exactly as they appear in the originals
-- nothing was corrected or bowdlerized for this disk. The layouts
are as close to the originals as humanly possible, including the
classification markings.

<H3>White House E-mail  CHRONOLOGY</H3>
<B>1982</B> - The National Security Council (NSC) staff at the White House acquires a prototype electronic mail system, from IBM, called the Professional Office
System (PROFs).
<P>
<B>April 1985 </B>- The PROFs e-mail system becomes fully operational within the NSC,
including not only the full staff, but also home terminals for the National
Security Adviser, Robert "Bud" McFarlane, and his deputy, Admiral John M.
Poindexter.
<P>
<B>November 1986</B> - The remainder of the White House comes on line with
electronic mail, at first with the PROFs system, and later (by the end of the 1980s) through a variety of systems including VAX A-1 ("All in One"), and ccmail.
<P>
<B>November 22-25, 1986</B> - John Poindexter and Oliver North electronically shred
more than 5000 e-mail notes in the memory banks of their computer systems, as the
Iran-contra scandal breaks.
<P>
<B>November 28, 1986</B> - Career staff at the White House Communications Agency
order the November backup tapes of the e-mail system to be saved instead of recycled as usual. Subsequently, investigators from the FBI and the Tower Commission use
the backup takes to reconstruct the Iran-contra scandal.
<P>
 - The Tower Commission issues its report on Iran-contra,
reprinting hundreds of PROFs notes exchanged by McFarlane, Poindexter and
North.
<P>
<B>January 19, 1989</B> - On the last day of the Reagan presidency, the National
Security Archive files a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests
together with a lawsuit against President Ronald Reagan, to prevent the imminent
erasure of the White House electronic mail backup tapes. At 6:10 pm, on the eve
of George Bush's inauguration, U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker issues a
Temporary Restraining Order, prohibiting the destruction of the backup tapes to
the PROFs system.
<P>
<B>September 15, 1989</B> - U.S. District Judge Charles B. Richey rules that the
National Security Archive and its co-plaintiffs, including the American
Historical Association (AHA) and the American Library Association (ALA), have
standing to sue President Bush, in order to force him to comply with the
retention requirements of various records acts which potentially cover the White
House e-mail.
<P>
<B>January 25, 1991</B> - After a year-and-a-half of legal procedural wrangling, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upholds Judge Richey's
ruling on standing, denying the Bush administration's attempts to have the case
dismissed.
<P>
<B>November 20, 1992</B> - On request from the plaintiffs, Judge Richey adds the White House e-mail from the lame-duck Bush administration to the case, issuing a
restraining order preventing the Bush White House from destroying its own
backup computer records.
<P>
<B>January 6, 1993</B> - Judge Richey rules that computer tapes containing copies of
e-mail messages by Reagan and Bush White House staff must be preserved like
other government records, because the electronic versions are not simply duplicates of
paper printouts, but contain additional information beyond the paper copies.
<P>
<B>January 11 and 14, 1993</B> - Judge Richey issues specific court orders requiring
that the Bush White House preserve its computer records. In press interviews,
Judge Richey says that despite his orders, he believes that the Bush
administration is planning to destroy its e-mail files.
<P>
<B>January 15, 1993</B> - In an expedited emergency ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit upholds and modifies the rulings by Judge
Richey, holding that government officials could erase White House and NSC
computer files, as long as they preserved, on backup tapes, identical copies of
what was being erased.
<P>
<B>January 19, 1993</B> - President Bush signs a secret agreement with Don Wilson,
head of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), purporting to
grant Bush exclusive legal control over the e-mail tapes of his administration. 
Working through the night, a staff team from NARA takes custody of thousands
of tapes and disk drives, hurriedly removing them from White House offices to
prevent incoming Clinton appointees from gaining access to them.
<P>
<B>February 16, 1993</B> - NARA career staff who managed the transfer describe in an internal memo how the so-called "midnight ride" had violated NARA's own rules
for records transfers and how several sets of tapes ordered preserved by Judge Richey
had been lost, erased or damaged.
<P>
<B>May 22, 1993 </B>- Judge Richey cites the Clinton White House and the acting
Archivist of the United States for contempt of court for failing to carry out his
order to issue new and appropriate guidelines for the preservation of the
computer records of the Reagan, Bush and Clinton White House staff.
<P>
<B>August 13, 1993</B> - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
vacates Judge Richey's contempt orders but upholds his overall decision that the
Federal Records Act (FRA) requires that complete electronic copies of e-mail
messages be preserved by the White House, and by extension, government
agencies in general. The appeals court remands the case to Judge Richey to decide the
issue of the dividing line between "agency" records covered by the FRA and
presidential records covered by the Presidential Records Act.
<P>
<B>March 25, 1994</B> - In a brief filed in federal court, the Clinton administration
declares that the National Security Council is not an agency, and should be
accorded the protection from public scrutiny given to the President's personal
advisers. This argument attempts to remove the Clinton administration's White
House e-mail from the reach of FOIA requests and the FRA, arguing that all its
documents are subject only to the Presidential Records Act (PRA) and therefore
not to court oversight.
<P>
<B>December 13, 1994</B> - The e-mail plaintiffs file suit against the Acting Archivist
of the United States to void the Bush-Wilson agreement, in American Historical
Association et. al. v. Peterson.

<B>February 15, 1995</B> - Judge Richey rejects the Clinton administration's arguments about the NSC's status as "arbitrary and capricious... contrary to history, past practice and the law," and declares that the National Security Council is an
agency. The government subsequently appeals the decision, and the plaintiffs
cross-appeal against a portion of Richey's ruling that opens a loophole for
senior NSC staff giving advice to the President.
<P>
<B>February 27, 1995</B> - In a separate opinion in the lawsuit over the Bush-Wilson
agreement, Judge Richey declares the agreement "null and void," writing that "No
one, not even a President, is above the law." The New York Times subsequently
editorializes, under the headline "A Special Place in History for Mr. Bush," that
"No President has the right to corner official records in an effort to control
his place in history." (March 1, 1995, page A18)
<P>
<B>September 8, 1995</B> - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit hears oral arguments in the case on the issue of Judge Richey's decision
and the agency versus Presidential status of the NSC.

                           - secret -
as i now understand the subject decisions, there will be no murphy 
meeting but there will be an arms sale. given the congressional mood, an 
arms package that includes everything but the aircraft stands a fair 
chance of congressional approval while sending the clearest policy 
signals to the middle east. i hope there is still an opportunity to 
consider modifying the package to give hussein 85 % of what he's after.

NOTE FROM:OLIVER NORTH
Subject:PRIVATE BLANK CHECK
Subject:Current Status of Operations Recovery:Following summary is based 
on discussions in Geneva among Kimche, Copp, Gorbanifahr and Kiyarashi 
which were concluded this weekend, subsequent discussions with Mendy 
Meron here in Washington which are continuing, and calls btwn Copp and 
Kimche's asset (Nimrodi) who is "baby sitting" the Iranians in Paris 
(where they are are receiving guidance Tehran).

The attempted transfer through Portugal of 18 Hawk missiles went awry 
because the Iranians were in fact seeking a weapons system that would be 
capable of stopping reconnaisance flights along the Iranian/Soviet border 
and on the Iranian/Iraqi border.  Gorba rptd that these flights occur 
regularly and as deep as 40mi inside Iranian airspace.  Because Schwimmer 
and Ledeen were unfamiliar with the operational parameters of the HAWK, 
they agreed to ship 120 weapons that were totally inadequate to meet the 
rqmts established by the Iranians.  This delivery has created an 
atmosphere of extraordinary distrust on the part of the Iranians; in 
Kimche's view, because the credibility of the Gorba/Kangarlu/ Kiyarashi 
mission has probably been seriously called into question. Despite this 
perception (Gorba said numerous times that this whole thing was a 
"cheating game" on the part of the Israelis), Copp & Kimche have been 
able to proceed with a renewed dialogue which still promises hope for 
achieving our three objectives:
-- support for a pragmatic - army oriented faction which could take over 
in a change of government
-- return of the five AMCIT hostages
-- no more terrorism directed against U.S. personnel or interests.

From these ongoing discussions, which in two cases included Iranian 
military officers, Copp and Kimche conclude that the military situation 
in Iran is desperate.  The Iranian descriptions of the state of their 
equipment, lack of competent management, inability to use much of the 
remaining U.S. materiel portends the real possibility of a military 
collapse (at least by the Army) in the near to mid-term.  Thus, there is 
considerable pressure on the interlocutors in Europe to produce quickly.

Given the relatively low level of competence on the part of the Iranians 
in Europe, and the fact that any supplies delivered will undoubtedly have 
to be examined by an Army or Air Force officer, it is very doubtful that 
a "single transaction" arrangement can be worked out with the parties in 
Tehran, no matter what is agreed to in Europe.  In short they have been 
"scammed" so many times in the past that the attitude of distrust is very 
high on their part.  At the same time, in all discussions (including 
today's phone calls) they are desperate to conclude some kind of 
arrangement in the next 10 days and have even asked that the meeting 
scheduled for Saturday in London be advanced.  Based on what we can 
conclude from intelligence in Beirut, we believe that they are very 
concerned that the hostages (the only Iranian leverage point besides the 
Jews in Iran) may be killed or captured/released by the Syrians, Druze, 
Phalange or Amal in the near future.  Waite's contacts with the captors 
seems to corroborate this assesment.  In short, time is very short for 
all parties concerned.

Finally, there is the matter of the longer term strategy for what we 
should be attempting to accomplish viz a viz the Iran-Iraq war ans a more 
reasonable government in Iran.  From my personal discussions with Kimche 
and Meron it is apparent the the Israelis want:the war to continue at a 
stalemate, a more moderate Iraninan government in the end and will 
somehow find a way to continue getting their people (Jews) out of Iran 
through some kind of barter arrangement.  In that the first two of their 
goals, it would seem, generally congruent w/ our interests, and their 
last a fact of life, we should probably be seeing the return of the AMCIT 
hostages as a subsidiary benefit -- not the primary objective, though it 
may be a part of the necessary first steps in achieving the broader 
objectives.  While Kimche, Meron, Copp and I all agree that there is a 
high degree of risk in pursuing the course we have started, we are now so 
far down the road that stopping what has been started could have even 
more serious repercussions.  We all view the next steps as "confidence 
building" on the part of both sides.  None of us have any illusions about 
the cast of characters we are dealing with on the other side.  They are a 
primitive, unsophisticated group who are extremely distrustful of the 
West in general and the Israeli/U.S. in particular.  They have not the 
slightest idea of what is going on in our government or how the system 
works.  Today for example, Gorba called Copp in absolute confusion over 
the fact that Rafsanjani had just received a letter from (of all people) 
Sen. Helms regarding the American Hostages.  Since the Iranians are 
adamant that they not be publicly connected with the seizure, holding or 
release of the AMCITs, why, Gorba wanted to know, was Helms being brought 
into this "solution to the puzzle."  Gorba reiterated that "Batri ought 
to have more control over the members of his parliment" than to allow 
them to confuse an already difficult problem.  Dick told him the letter 
had nothing to do with what we are about, but Gorba did not seem 
convinced that this wasn't some sort of effort to embarass Iran.
Given this very unsophisticated view of things on their part and the 
distrust that the Iranians obviously feel, we believe that if we stop the 
current effort at this point and do not at least proceed with a "test" of 
the current? relationship we:

-- run the risk of never being able to establish a "foothold" for     the 
longer term goals in that the people we are dealing with will be totally 
discredited at home; and
-- incur the greater likelihood of reprisals against us for "leading them 
on."  These reprisals could take the form of additional hostage seizures, 
execution of some/all of those now held, or both.

While the threat to carry out sanctions against us has not, to my 
knowledge, ever arisen (it certainly has not since Kimche/Copp/ North 
have been directly engaged -- and Michael never mentioned it), it is 
interesting to note that when Copp questioned the bona fides of Gorba and 
his cohorts as capable of delivering on their end of the arrangement, 
Gorba carefully noted that since these discussions began w/ Michael & 
Schwimmer, there has not been a single Islamic Jihad bomb threat, 
hijacking or kidnapping -- and that there would be none if this "worked." 
 D.K., Copp and I regard this to be at least one sign of confidence that 
this activity may yet prosper.  There are some lesser indications of 
confidence in recent days:
-- in response to Copp's demand for funds to be deposited in advance to 
defray operational costs, and what the Iranians were told were 
"purchases" on the arms market" a total of $41M has been deposited;
-- the 18 HAWKs delivered last week have been repackaged and are ready 
for return to origin on the next available flight;
-- the parties in Europe continue to stress that their requirements are 
long-term and that they are anxious to get on with a longer range program 
of Israeli originated support which would include technical assistance w/ 
sophisticated hardware which is critically needed but deadlined (in this 
regard Gorba at one point noted that at times they have as few as 50 
operationalmtanks and less than a dozen flyable aircraft).

With all of the above as a lengthy preamble describing two nearly frantic 
weeks w/ the Israelis & Iranians, the following proposal has evolved 
which the Iranians today said they wd like to discuss in detail on 
Saturday:
-- The total "package" from the Israelis wd consist of 50 HAWKs w/PIP 
(product improvement package) and 3300 basic TOWs.
-- Deliveries wd commence on or about 12 December as follows:
   H hr:    1 707 w/300 TOWs = 1 AMCIT
   H+10hrs: 1 707 (same A/C) w/300 TOWs = 1 AMCIT
   H+16hrs: 1 747 w/50 HAWKs & 400 TOWs = 2 AMCITs
   H+20hrs: 1 707 w/300 TOWs = 1 AMCIT
   H+24hrs: 1 747 w/2000 TOWs = French Hostage

All involved on our side recognize that this does not meet one of the 
basic criteria established at the opening of this venture:a single 
transaction which wd be preceded by a release of hostages.  However, 
given the points above regarding the mutual distrust in the dialogue, we 
all believe it is about the only way we can get the overall process 
moving.  Measures have been taken to reduce the chance for duplicity on 
the part of the Iranians and to preserve a measure of OPSEC in carrying 
out the transaction.  In the case of a double cross, one of the Iranians 
will be in the hands of assets we control throughout.  One of them 
(Kangarlu) has already suffered a serious (although apparently not fatal) 
heart attack after last week's HAWK transaction failed to produce 
results.  The first two deliveries, via 707 freighters are relatively 
small and if they do not produce the desired outcomes, all else stops.  
All $ are now under our control. 

OpSEC concerns are threefold:communications, deliveries enroute to Iran 
and replenishment of the Israeli stocks.  To solve the first problem an 
OPs Code is now in use by all parties.  This code is similar to the one 
used to oversee deliveries to the Nicaraguan Resistance and has never 
been compromised.  The delivery/flight planning security problem has been 
solved by a much more deliberate selection of aircraft and aircrews as 
well as a series of transient airfields which can be used enroute to the 
field controlled by the Iranian Army at Tabriz.  Appropriate arrangements 
have also been made to ensure that the overflight of Turkey is not 
challenged.  All A/C will be inspected by one of the Iranians at a 
transient location between Tel Aviv and Tabriz.  Before the A/C actually 
crosses into Iranian airspace, the appropriate release(s) must occur. The 
last OPSEC concern, that of replenishing Israeli stocks, is probably the 
most delicate issue. The quality of TOWs requested represents [Deleted, 
(b)(1)(s) exemption] Meron and I are working w/ the Israeli purchasing 
office in NYC to ensure that the replenishment can be accomplished 
quickly after December 12 as possible.  All recognize that quantities 
[Deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] degrade Israeli readiness and that the 
items will need to be dispatched quickly in order to preclude 
disaffection and leaks.  Meron has solved at least one of the problems in 
this regard by identifying a means of transferring the required cash to 
an IDF account which will allow cash (rather than FMS credit) purchases 
from the U.S.

In order to put this plan into action, Kimche, Copp, Schwimmer and Goode 
plan to meet in London on Saturday morning to review all arrangements.  
If we are satisfied that all our assets (money, aircraft, aircrews, 
transit facilities, overflight arrangements and military equipment) are 
prepared, Copp and Kimche will meet another hotel with Gorba and Kiyarahi 
to finalize the plan.  Our side will then reconvene later in the evening 
at our hotel to review any last minute changes.  I wd then call you 
(using the Ops code), transmit the agreed upon arrangements for approval 
and, if you concur, Kimche & Copp will meet again w/ the Iranians on 
Sunday a.m. to express our agreement with the plan.  Copp & Goode wd 
return to the U.S. Sunday p.m. on separate flights.  On the 11th, the day 
before the plan is to be executed, Copp will establish a CP in Cyprus at 
the Turkish controlled airfield (Arjan) where he can monitor 
implementation and stop it at any point we desire.  The secondary fields 
at Brindisi, Cagliary (Sardinia) and Lisbon will be covered by Copp 
controlled assets who are not witting of the true origin, destination or 
contents of the A/C but who can "fix" things in a hurry if something goes 
wrong.  One of our people will be in contact in Turkey throughout.

[Three lines deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] Once in hand, the hostages 
will be flown [Deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] to Larnaca on our Navy HH-53 
where they will be picked up by a EUCOM C-141 and flown to Wiesbaden for 
debriefing.  18hrs later Oakley will proceed from Andrews AFB to 
Wiesbaden with family members -- thus allowing us 24 uninterrupted hours 
for debriefing.  The debrief team will be staged at Wiesbaden 12 hours in 
advance, just as we did two weeks ago without notariety.  Dewey is not 
briefed on [Deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] -- though he suspects.  The 
Israelis are in the same position.  Dewey and I have been through the 
whole concept twice looking for holes and can find little that can be 
done to improve it given the "trust factor" with the Iranians.  In that 
all parties involved have great interest in keeping this as quiet as 
possible, and [One line deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption], we believe it to 
be worth the risk. I have not confided in Dewey re the longer term goals 
we could/should hope to achieve.  Thus, the only parties fully aware of 
all dimensions of what we are about are you and RCM.

I have given careful consideration to what you suggested re an RCM 
meeting with the Iranians in an effort to obtain release of the hostages 
before starting on an effort to undo the present regieme in Tehran.  Like 
you and Bud, I find the idea of bartering over the lives of these poor 
men repugnant.  Nonetheless, I believe that we are, at this point, 
barring unforseen developments in London or Tel Aviv, too far along with 
the Iranians to risk turning back now.  If we do not at least make one 
more try at this point, we stand a good chance of condemning some or all 
to death and a renewed wave of Islamic Jihad terrorism.  While the risks 
of proceeding are significant, the risks of not trying one last time are 
even greater.

<B>November 1986</B> - The remainder of the White House comes on line with
electronic mail, at first with the PROFs system, and later (by the end of the 1980s) through a variety of systems including VAX A-1 ("All in One"), and ccmail.
<P>
<B>November 22-25, 1986</B> - John Poindexter and Oliver North electronically shred
more than 5000 e-mail notes in the memory banks of their computer systems, as the
Iran-contra scandal breaks.
<P>
<B>November 28, 1986</B> - Career staff at the White House Communications Agency
order the November backup tapes of the e-mail system to be saved instead of recycled as usual. Subsequently, investigators from the FBI and the Tower Commission use
the backup takes to reconstruct the Iran-contra scandal.
<P>
 - The Tower Commission issues its report on Iran-contra,
reprinting hundreds of PROFs notes exchanged by McFarlane, Poindexter and
North.
<P>
<B>January 19, 1989</B> - On the last day of the Reagan presidency, the National
Security Archive files a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests
together with a lawsuit against President Ronald Reagan, to prevent the imminent
erasure of the White House electronic mail backup tapes. At 6:10 pm, on the eve
of George Bush's inauguration, U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker issues a
Temporary Restraining Order, prohibiting the destruction of the backup tapes to
the PROFs system.
<P>
<B>September 15, 1989</B> - U.S. District Judge Charles B. Richey rules that the
National Security Archive and its co-plaintiffs, including the American
Historical Association (AHA) and the American Library Association (ALA), have
standing to sue President Bush, in order to force him to comply with the
retention requirements of various records acts which potentially cover the White
House e-mail.
<P>
<B>January 25, 1991</B> - After a year-and-a-half of legal procedural wrangling, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upholds Judge Richey's
ruling on standing, denying the Bush administration's attempts to have the case
dismissed.
<P>
<B>November 20, 1992</B> - On request from the plaintiffs, Judge Richey adds the White House e-mail from the lame-duck Bush administration to the case, issuing a
restraining order preventing the Bush White House from destroying its own
backup computer records.
<P>
<B>January 6, 1993</B> - Judge Richey rules that computer tapes containing copies of
e-mail messages by Reagan and Bush White House staff must be preserved like
other government records, because the electronic versions are not simply duplicates of
paper printouts, but contain additional information beyond the paper copies.
<P>
<B>January 11 and 14, 1993</B> - Judge Richey issues specific court orders requiring
that the Bush White House preserve its computer records. In press interviews,
Judge Richey says that despite his orders, he believes that the Bush
administration is planning to destroy its e-mail files.
<P>
<B>January 15, 1993</B> - In an expedited emergency ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit upholds and modifies the rulings by Judge
Richey, holding that government officials could erase White House and NSC
computer files, as long as they preserved, on backup tapes, identical copies of
what was being erased.
<P>
<B>January 19, 1993</B> - President Bush signs a secret agreement with Don Wilson,
head of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), purporting to
grant Bush exclusive legal control over the e-mail tapes of his administration. 
Working through the night, a staff team from NARA takes custody of thousands
of tapes and disk drives, hurriedly removing them from White House offices to
prevent incoming Clinton appointees from gaining access to them.
<P>
<B>February 16, 1993</B> - NARA career staff who managed the transfer describe in an internal memo how the so-called "midnight ride" had violated NARA's own rules
for records transfers and how several sets of tapes ordered preserved by Judge Richey
had been lost, erased or damaged.
<P>
<B>May 22, 1993 </B>- Judge Richey cites the Clinton White House and the acting
Archivist of the United States for contempt of court for failing to carry out his
order to issue new and appropriate guidelines for the preservation of the
computer records of the Reagan, Bush and Clinton White House staff.
<P>
<B>August 13, 1993</B> - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
vacates Judge Richey's contempt orders but upholds his overall decision that the
Federal Records Act (FRA) requires that complete electronic copies of e-mail
messages be preserved by the White House, and by extension, government
agencies in general. The appeals court remands the case to Judge Richey to decide the
issue of the dividing line between "agency" records covered by the FRA and
presidential records covered by the Presidential Records Act.
<P>
<B>March 25, 1994</B> - In a brief filed in federal court, the Clinton administration
declares that the National Security Council is not an agency, and should be
accorded the protection from public scrutiny given to the President's personal
advisers. This argument attempts to remove the Clinton administration's White
House e-mail from the reach of FOIA requests and the FRA, arguing that all its
documents are subject only to the Presidential Records Act (PRA) and therefore
not to court oversight.
<P>
<B>December 13, 1994</B> - The e-mail plaintiffs file suit against the Acting Archivist
of the United States to void the Bush-Wilson agreement, in American Historical
Association et. al. v. Peterson.
<P>
<B>February 15, 1995</B> - Judge Richey rejects the Clinton administration's arguments about the NSC's status as "arbitrary and capricious... contrary to history, past practice and the law," and declares that the National Security Council is an
agency. The government subsequently appeals the decision, and the plaintiffs
cross-appeal against a portion of Richey's ruling that opens a loophole for
senior NSC staff giving advice to the President.
<P>
<B>February 27, 1995</B> - In a separate opinion in the lawsuit over the Bush-Wilson
agreement, Judge Richey declares the agreement "null and void," writing that "No
one, not even a President, is above the law." The New York Times subsequently
editorializes, under the headline "A Special Place in History for Mr. Bush," that
"No President has the right to corner official records in an effort to control
his place in history." (March 1, 1995, page A18)
<P>
<B>September 8, 1995</B> - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit hears oral arguments in the case on the issue of Judge Richey's decision
and the agency versus Presidential status of the NSC.

Thanks to our friends at the National Security Archive, Tom Blanton and 
The New
Press, <b>george jr.</b> is able to bring you, raw and unplugged, 
genuine-article, top-secret
messages - from Blanton's book, White House E-mail - that the Reagan/Bush 
White
House tried to destroy. 

<P>
We'll bring you several of their actual email messages a week, until heck freezes over,  without editorial gloss.
<P>
<A HREF="#techies">Techies</A> will want to know: These messages are scanned ASCII  text files on DOS-formatted disk (edited by Blanton, produced by Ian Stevenson with technical gizmonics from John Martinez).
<P>
In case you've forgotten--here's a <A HREF="#whoswho">who's who</A>, the rogue's gallery from the Reagan-Bush years. And for those, who like us can  barely remember what we had for breakfast, here's a <A HREF="#chronology">chronology</A> of  White House events.

NOTE FROM:OLIVER NORTH
Subject:MIKE LEDEEN
Have told this to Ami[?]. You should be aware, however, that it is my 
opinion, based on my meeting w/ Gorba on Monday night, that Gorba tells 
Ledeen everything. Ami[?] suspects that there is probably a secret 
business arrangement among Schwimmer, Ledeen and Gorba that is being 
conducted w/o the knowledge of any of the three respective governments 
and that this will result in at least some cross fertilization of 
information. This may not be altogether bad if we can keep in touch w/ 
Ledeen enough to get a feel for what is really going on. I have no 
problem w/ someone making an honest profit on honest business. I do have 
a problem if it means the compromise of sensitive political or 
operational details. We might consider making Mike a contract employee of 
the CIA and requiring him to take a periodic polygraph. Yes? No?

NOTE FROM:JAMES R. STARK
SUBJECT:Saudi arms
Don raised an important issue yesterday with respect to the number of 
missiles in the Saudi package.  The numbers were based on the long-term 
assessment of potential threats to Saudi Arabia (South Yemen, Iran, and 
Iraq) which would apply through the end of the missile delivery period.  
They are based on the standard methodology for computing threat-oriented 
weapons inventory requirements, and were originally much larger (based on 
a combined Iran-Iraq threat).  The current AIM-9 numbers are based on the 
threat from the largest single potential foe--Iraq.
  As a benchmark, you should be aware that we have already sold the 
Saudis a large number of missiles.  The following list shows the total 
sold and, in parentheses, the number remaining to be delivered to 
complete that total. [Three lines deleted, (b)(1)(c) exemption]
  As you can see, there are [Deleted, (b)(1)(c) exemption] Sidewinders 
still in the pipeline awaiting delivery to the Saudis.  Thus, a US move 
to notify additional missiles would have less immediate military value 
than accelerating deliveries already approved.  The Saudi goal is the 
tangible evidence of US political support and commitment for their 
security represented by a Presidential decision to raise the arms issue.

These excerpts are from a National Security Archive Documents Disk, (C) 1995 The National Security Archive, of 260 substantive White House e-mail messages which could not fit in <i>White House E-mail </i>(New Press, $14.95) for space reasons.

The White House refused to provide any of the e-mail in electronic
form. Rather, White House and other government staff printed out
the specific e-mail messages targetted by the National Security
Archive's Freedom of Information Act requests, then reviewed the
printouts for classified information and privacy issues before
releasing them in hard copy form.
<P>
Ian Stevenson then employed a Hewlett Packard ScanJet IIc/ADF
scanner, together with CAERE optical character recognition
software, to digitize the large stack of White House printouts
selected for this disk. The typographical errors, run-on
sentences, bad grammar, colloquial language and other questionable
matters found here are all exactly as they appear in the originals
-- nothing was corrected or bowdlerized for this disk. The layouts
are as close to the originals as humanly possible, including the
classification markings.

<B>January 19, 1989</B> - On the last day of the Reagan presidency, the National
Security Archive files a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests
together with a lawsuit against President Ronald Reagan, to prevent the imminent
erasure of the White House electronic mail backup tapes. At 6:10 pm, on the eve
of George Bush's inauguration, U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker issues a
Temporary Restraining Order, prohibiting the destruction of the backup tapes to
the PROFs system.
<P>
<B>September 15, 1989</B> - U.S. District Judge Charles B. Richey rules that the
National Security Archive and its co-plaintiffs, including the American
Historical Association (AHA) and the American Library Association (ALA), have
standing to sue President Bush, in order to force him to comply with the
retention requirements of various records acts which potentially cover the White
House e-mail.

<B>January 25, 1991</B> - After a year-and-a-half of legal procedural wrangling, the

dismissed.
<P>
<B>November 20, 1992</B> - On request from the plaintiffs, Judge Richey adds the White House e-mail from the lame-duck Bush administration to the case, issuing a
restraining order preventing the Bush White House from destroying its own
backup computer records.
<P>
<B>January 6, 1993</B> - Judge Richey rules that computer tapes containing copies of
e-mail messages by Reagan and Bush White House staff must be preserved like

what was being erased.
<P>
<B>January 19, 1993</B> - President Bush signs a secret agreement with Don Wilson,
head of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), purporting to
grant Bush exclusive legal control over the e-mail tapes of his administration.

of tapes and disk drives, hurriedly removing them from White House offices to
prevent incoming Clinton appointees from gaining access to them.
<P>
<B>February 16, 1993</B> - NARA career staff who managed the transfer describe in an internal memo how the so-called "midnight ride" had violated NARA's own rules
for records transfers and how several sets of tapes ordered preserved by Judge Richey

Archivist of the United States for contempt of court for failing to carry out his
order to issue new and appropriate guidelines for the preservation of the
computer records of the Reagan, Bush and Clinton White House staff.
<P>
<B>August 13, 1993</B> - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
vacates Judge Richey's contempt orders but upholds his overall decision that the
Federal Records Act (FRA) requires that complete electronic copies of e-mail
messages be preserved by the White House, and by extension, government
agencies in general. The appeals court remands the case to Judge Richey to decide the
issue of the dividing line between "agency" records covered by the FRA and
presidential records covered by the Presidential Records Act.
<P>
<B>March 25, 1994</B> - In a brief filed in federal court, the Clinton administration
declares that the National Security Council is not an agency, and should be
accorded the protection from public scrutiny given to the President's personal
advisers. This argument attempts to remove the Clinton administration's White
House e-mail from the reach of FOIA requests and the FRA, arguing that all its
documents are subject only to the Presidential Records Act (PRA) and therefore
not to court oversight.
<P>
<B>December 13, 1994</B> - The e-mail plaintiffs file suit against the Acting Archivist
of the United States to void the Bush-Wilson agreement, in American Historical
Association et. al. v. Peterson.
<P>
<B>February 15, 1995</B> - Judge Richey rejects the Clinton administration's arguments about the NSC's status as "arbitrary and capricious... contrary to history, past practice and the law," and declares that the National Security Council is an
agency. The government subsequently appeals the decision, and the plaintiffs
cross-appeal against a portion of Richey's ruling that opens a loophole for
senior NSC staff giving advice to the President.
<P>
<B>February 27, 1995</B> - In a separate opinion in the lawsuit over the Bush-Wilson
agreement, Judge Richey declares the agreement "null and void," writing that "No
one, not even a President, is above the law." The New York Times subsequently
editorializes, under the headline "A Special Place in History for Mr. Bush," that
"No President has the right to corner official records in an effort to control
his place in history." (March 1, 1995, page A18)
<P>
<B>September 8, 1995</B> - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit hears oral arguments in the case on the issue of Judge Richey's decision
and the agency versus Presidential status of the NSC.

NOTE FROM:OLIVER NORTH
Subject:Anything New??
After the House vote on aid to the resistance, I plan to take a few days 
just to get re-acquainted w/ the family. Meanwhile, we are trying to find 
a way to get 10 BLOWPIPE launchers and 20 missiles from [Deleted, 
(b)(1)(s) exemption] thru the Short Bros. Rep. The V.P. from Short Bros. 
sought me out several mos. ago and I met w/ him again in London a few 
weeks ago when I was there [Deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] Short Bros., 
the mfgr. of the BLOWPIPE, is willing to arrange the deal, conduct the 
training and even send U.K. "tech reps" fwd if we can close the 
arrangement. Dick Secord has already paid 10% down on the delivery and we 
have a Salvadoran EUC which is acceptable to the [Deleted, (b)(1)(s) 
exemption] Unfortunately, the week all this was going to closure we 
decided to go fwd [Deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] The arrangement is now 
on ice and we are casting about for a way to tell the [Deleted, (b)(1)(s) 
exemption] that we wd be pleased if this all went thru. Yr thoughts wd be 
appreciated.

On our other action, there are fresh developments. Yesterday, [Deleted, 
(b)(1)(s) exemption] called the phone drop that Dick Secord had given 
him. Al Hakim, who we passed off as a"White House interpreter" at the 
Frankfurt mtg. spoke to [Deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] twice yesterday. 
The bottom line of the calls is that [Deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] wd 
like to have us meet w/ the Iranian side next week at Kharg Island. 
Supposedly, during the mtg the hostages wd be released and we wd 
immediately start delivering the 3k TOWs and agree at the mtg to the 
delivery of spare parts which they desperately need. They profess to be 
very concerned about the nature of the Soviet threat and want all we can 
give them on that score. Not sure at this point how real this offer is, 
but he says Rafsanjani wd come as the head of the Iranian side. If this 
looks like a go -- and we should know more tomorrow when the next phone 
call is scheduled--how are you for travel during the week of 31Mar-4Apr?  
Warm regards, North BT

NOTE FROM:Peter Rodman
SUBJECT:Saudi Arms
  A friend of mine on the West Coast who is well plugged in to the Jewish 
community leadership called me to offer his ideas/help on the Saudi 
package. (He's a strong Reagan supporter and has heard many lectures from 
me on the importance of our military relations with Arabs.)  
  The idea he was suggesting was that we offer Israel some new goody as 
part of a "package deal" -- he's convinced this would give both Jewish 
leaders and pro-Israel Senators a way out. First he suggested forgiveness 
of FMS debt, which I explained was a non-starter for budgetary 
reasons.Then he expressed interest in the various things Rabin had come 
over to argue for, which were all artfully designed not to have budgetary 
consequences.
  I have no idea whether these things are do-able. But this guy is 
convinced that linking the Saudi package with something for Israel would 
change a lot of votes, and he is in a position to know whereof he speaks.
  Where does DoD stand on the various things Rabin was asking about? Has 
anyone thought about these two issues in tandem?

NOTE FROM:Peter Rodman
SUBJECT:Saudi Arms
  My earlier note, passing on a suggestion about sweetening the pot with 
something for Israel, OBE. But save it for future reference:Many times in 
the past, things unpalatable to the pro-Israel crowd -- whether arms 
deals with Arabs or even argreements involving withdrawals from territory 
-- have been made more palatable by adding something to their side of the 
ledger (instead of subtracting from the other side). Any future 
breakthrough in the peace process will probably also find us looking for 
ways to buy them off the same way.

NOTE FROM:OLIVER NORTH
Subject:Iran
Have just returned from mtg w/ Rabin, who called at 1910 and asked me to 
come by his hotel. Mtg lasted abt 1.5hrs. Summary:Vy complementary to you 
& noted that the hostage operation had to be the longest running no-leak 
operation of its kind in history. Said he was vy pleased w/ yr reaction & 
SecShultz re Kfir to Honduras.  He finally got to the point of inviting 
me over. He noted press stories and other intel on lack of supplies for 
Contras and wanted to know if we had any need for SovBloc weaps and ammo 
he could make avail. I told him that we wd vy much like to have whatever 
he cd spare and he asked "has your shipload left the Med yet?" (This is 
the one I tried to get Casey's people to pay for as a means of covering 
some of Dick's debts). At this point I cd see no reason to dissemble, and 
told him it was in Lisbon. He then suggested that if it is "your ship, 
not the CIA's," it shd come to Haifa and he wd have it filled w/ whatever 
they cd have assembled in the next five days. He went on at some length 
about his low opinion of our intel service - both in terms of covert ops 
and intelligence collecting (I noted that maybe we were getting better at 
counterintelligence than they thought - and he allowed that was probably 
true and that there would "be no more Pollards).  Bottom line:Don't quite 
no what to do.  Did not want to turn down offer - since it includes 
recently seized PLO shipment captured at sea. We can go ahead and move 
the whole shipment to Honduras or El Salvador - but still won't have any 
money to pay off rapidly growing debts. Hate to turn away offers like 
this - it will really help in the long run. Any advice? V/R North P.S. 
pls look at today's [Deleted, (b)(1)(c) exemption] re Contra resupply 
effort. All flights being flown - including three msns last night and 
three more tonight at last light have been vy successful. All being done 
by Dick's pilots w/ borrowed $.

The White House refused to provide any of the e-mail in electronic
form. Rather, White House and other government staff printed out
the specific e-mail messages targetted by the National Security
Archive's Freedom of Information Act requests, then reviewed the
printouts for classified information and privacy issues before
releasing them in hard copy form.
<P>
Ian Stevenson then employed a Hewlett Packard ScanJet IIc/ADF
scanner, together with CAERE optical character recognition
software, to digitize the large stack of White House printouts
selected for this disk. The typographical errors, run-on
sentences, bad grammar, colloquial language and other questionable
matters found here are all exactly as they appear in the originals
-- nothing was corrected or bowdlerized for this disk. The layouts
are as close to the originals as humanly possible, including the

<H3>White House E-mail  CHRONOLOGY</H3>
<B>1982</B> - The National Security Council (NSC) staff at the White House acquires a prototype electronic mail system, from IBM, called the Professional Office
System (PROFs).
<P>
<B>April 1985 </B>- The PROFs e-mail system becomes fully operational within the NSC,
including not only the full staff, but also home terminals for the National
Security Adviser, Robert "Bud" McFarlane, and his deputy, Admiral John M.
Poindexter.
<P>
<B>November 1986</B> - The remainder of the White House comes on line with
electronic mail, at first with the PROFs system, and later (by the end of the 1980s) through a variety of systems including VAX A-1 ("All in One"), and ccmail.
<P>
<B>November 22-25, 1986</B> - John Poindexter and Oliver North electronically shred
more than 5000 e-mail notes in the memory banks of their computer systems, as the
Iran-contra scandal breaks.
<P>
<B>November 28, 1986</B> - Career staff at the White House Communications Agency
order the November backup tapes of the e-mail system to be saved instead of recycled as usual. Subsequently, investigators from the FBI and the Tower Commission use
the backup takes to reconstruct the Iran-contra scandal.
<P>
 - The Tower Commission issues its report on Iran-contra,
reprinting hundreds of PROFs notes exchanged by McFarlane, Poindexter and
North.
<P>
<B>January 19, 1989</B> - On the last day of the Reagan presidency, the National
Security Archive files a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests
together with a lawsuit against President Ronald Reagan, to prevent the imminent
erasure of the White House electronic mail backup tapes. At 6:10 pm, on the eve
of George Bush's inauguration, U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker issues a
Temporary Restraining Order, prohibiting the destruction of the backup tapes to
the PROFs system.
<P>
<B>September 15, 1989</B> - U.S. District Judge Charles B. Richey rules that the
National Security Archive and its co-plaintiffs, including the American
Historical Association (AHA) and the American Library Association (ALA), have
standing to sue President Bush, in order to force him to comply with the
retention requirements of various records acts which potentially cover the White
House e-mail.
<P>
<B>January 25, 1991</B> - After a year-and-a-half of legal procedural wrangling, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upholds Judge Richey's
ruling on standing, denying the Bush administration's attempts to have the case
dismissed.
<P>
<B>November 20, 1992</B> - On request from the plaintiffs, Judge Richey adds the White House e-mail from the lame-duck Bush administration to the case, issuing a
restraining order preventing the Bush White House from destroying its own
backup computer records.
<P>
<B>January 6, 1993</B> - Judge Richey rules that computer tapes containing copies of
e-mail messages by Reagan and Bush White House staff must be preserved like
other government records, because the electronic versions are not simply duplicates of
paper printouts, but contain additional information beyond the paper copies.
<P>
<B>January 11 and 14, 1993</B> - Judge Richey issues specific court orders requiring
that the Bush White House preserve its computer records. In press interviews,
Judge Richey says that despite his orders, he believes that the Bush
administration is planning to destroy its e-mail files.
<P>
<B>January 15, 1993</B> - In an expedited emergency ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit upholds and modifies the rulings by Judge
Richey, holding that government officials could erase White House and NSC
computer files, as long as they preserved, on backup tapes, identical copies of
what was being erased.
<P>
<B>January 19, 1993</B> - President Bush signs a secret agreement with Don Wilson,
head of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), purporting to
grant Bush exclusive legal control over the e-mail tapes of his administration. 
Working through the night, a staff team from NARA takes custody of thousands
of tapes and disk drives, hurriedly removing them from White House offices to
prevent incoming Clinton appointees from gaining access to them.
<P>
<B>February 16, 1993</B> - NARA career staff who managed the transfer describe in an internal memo how the so-called "midnight ride" had violated NARA's own rules
for records transfers and how several sets of tapes ordered preserved by Judge Richey
had been lost, erased or damaged.
<P>
<B>May 22, 1993 </B>- Judge Richey cites the Clinton White House and the acting
Archivist of the United States for contempt of court for failing to carry out his
order to issue new and appropriate guidelines for the preservation of the
computer records of the Reagan, Bush and Clinton White House staff.
<P>
<B>August 13, 1993</B> - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
vacates Judge Richey's contempt orders but upholds his overall decision that the
Federal Records Act (FRA) requires that complete electronic copies of e-mail
messages be preserved by the White House, and by extension, government
agencies in general. The appeals court remands the case to Judge Richey to decide the
issue of the dividing line between "agency" records covered by the FRA and
presidential records covered by the Presidential Records Act.
<P>
<B>March 25, 1994</B> - In a brief filed in federal court, the Clinton administration
declares that the National Security Council is not an agency, and should be
accorded the protection from public scrutiny given to the President's personal
advisers. This argument attempts to remove the Clinton administration's White
House e-mail from the reach of FOIA requests and the FRA, arguing that all its
documents are subject only to the Presidential Records Act (PRA) and therefore
not to court oversight.
<P>
<B>December 13, 1994</B> - The e-mail plaintiffs file suit against the Acting Archivist
of the United States to void the Bush-Wilson agreement, in American Historical
Association et. al. v. Peterson.
<P>
<B>February 15, 1995</B> - Judge Richey rejects the Clinton administration's arguments about the NSC's status as "arbitrary and capricious... contrary to history, past practice and the law," and declares that the National Security Council is an
agency. The government subsequently appeals the decision, and the plaintiffs
cross-appeal against a portion of Richey's ruling that opens a loophole for

his place in history." (March 1, 1995, page A18)

<H2>the ruination of lynne sharon schwartz</H2> 
<h3><i>by nicholas a. basbanes</i></h3>
<P>
  Of all uniquely human experiences, reading, more than any other, 
allows people to transcend time and space and commune one-on-one with 
artists and thinkers throughout the world.
<p>
  "Reading is such an intimate thing that people feel uncommonly 
passionate about it,'' the novelist Lynne Sharon Schwartz said during a 
recent interview occasioned by release of a charming new book she has 
written about the pertinence of books to her life; the title, <I>Ruined 
by Reading </I>(Beacon Press, 119 pages, $18), is so preposterously 
ironic that it cries out for an explanation. 
<p>
   The author previously of such acclaimed novels as <I>Disturbances in 
the Field, Leaving Brooklyn</I> and <I>The Fatigue Artist</I>, Schwartz 
explained that <I>Ruined by Reading</I> was selected after 20 other 
proposals, each one seeming to suggest a kind of personalized travelogue 
through favorite books and card catalogues, were weighed and discarded by 
her publisher.
<p>
   As an afterthought, Schwartz suggested taking a phrase from a wry 
remark about books attributed many years ago to Jimmy Walker, the dapper 
songwriter-turned-politician who served as mayor of New York City from 
1925 to 1932. Asked once to comment on a controversial censorship case 
then being argued, Walker is said
to have replied that as far as he knew, "no girl was ever ruined by 
reading a book."
<p>
   Schwartz said she proposed <I>Ruined by Reading</I> as a joke. "I 
threw it in for laughs, to let my editor have a good time looking at 
it," she said, but it turned out to be the overwhelming favorite of the 
publishing house, and it seems to be pleasing early readers of the book 
as well.
<p>
   "There is this small band of people - and I'm one of them - who feel 
that when everything else is over and done with, now is the time that you 
can finally sit down and read," Schwartz said. 
<p>
   "For me, that is each day's goal, to get everything else out of the 
way so I can have this private moment with my books. It's much more than 
an escape, it's like a little inner dialogue that  makes it so 
wonderful."
<p>
   What gives her tightly composed, elegantly phrased book such 
good-natured charm is that it is a personal reflection of one woman's 
passion for words on paper, not a didactic tract that gets mired in 
fashionable bombast or high-minded pedantry. 
<p>
   "I love to read," Schwartz explained simply. "It shaped my life. 
When I was a child, I would read under the covers late at night with a 
flashlight. Reading is such a private act, there's nothing else quite 
like it. It's a special way of being alone."
<p>
   Being absorbed by the private act of reading, however, and writing 
what is essentially a long, personal essay about it, are two different 
matters, and Schwartz is frank about what motivated her to embark upon it.
   "I started writing it right after I had finished <I>Leaving 
Brooklyn</I> in 1989, and the truth is that I wrote it in a state of 
desperation," she said. "That's not as bad as it sounds,
because I write a lot of books in desperation, but this time I feared 
that I was written out. I thought that I had nothing more to say. I felt 
I didn't have a topic."
<p>
   So, while "casting around" for something to write about, Schwartz 
hit on a subject that had enchanted her since early childhood. "I 
realized that what I know about is reading, it's something I had done all 
my life. I started writing just whatever thoughts came to me about the 
books in my childhood and what had touched my life."
<p>
   In the book, Schwartz notes that her "addiction" these days is to 
"works of the imagination," novels, poetry and various other creative 
pieces, but that as a girl she "longed to read everything, simply 
because it was written, like adventurers who
climb Mount Everest because it is there."
<p>
   More of a reflection on meaning than a long recitation of titles, 
<I>Ruined by Reading</I> is a window into the shaping of a soul. She does 
cite some books from her childhood with particular fondness, however, the 
fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm and Hans
Christian Andersen, the novels of Dickens, the stories of Kipling and 
Poe, the poems of Keats, the sonnets of Shakespeare. 
<p>
   "I remember my childhood books because they were engraved so deeply 
in my consciousness, whereas books I didn't love so much, or some of the 
books I picked up after the age of 30, I don't remember as well because 
they didn't form me or shape me in a way."
<p>
   And while <I>Ruined by Reading</I> is very much about her own "life 
in books," as the subtitle states, Schwartz stressed that she has not 
written a memoir. "I don't have this urge that a lot of other writers 
have to tell about my life, which is why I write fiction," she said.
<p>
   "I don't like the idea of people reading my books to find out about 
me. They should not be interested in me, they should be interested in the 
book. This book talks about reading as a lens through which you see 
everything. It is something that you love
to do, and that you will do until the day you die."

<H2>essay:   finding a way 'Home'</H2> 
<h3><i>by Beth Powning</i></h3>
<IMG SRC="/october/home.jpg" WIDTH=220 HEIGHT=237 HSPACE=15 ALIGN=left>
 
     Beth Powning is a naturalist whose work has been published in a  variety of books, journals and magazines.  She has two photography books,  <I>Roses for Canadian Gardens</I> (1991), and <I>Hardy Trees and Shrubs</I> (1996),  both with Key Porter Books (Toronto).
    In May, her  book of lyrical prose and color photographs was published simultaneously by Penguin Books Canada (Toronto) as <I>Seeds of Another Summer: Finding the Spirit of Home in Nature</I>, and, in the United States, as  <I>Home: Chronicles of a North Country Life</I>  by Stewart, Tabori & Chang ($22.50). She muses on how her life and book came to be:
<br clear=all>
<hr width=80%>
<blockquote>
  This book was a coming together of my love of nature, which I had been expressing with my camera, and my increasingly strong feeling that my sense of estrangement was lessening the longer I lived in one place and grew to know the  natural world.
<p>
   Having left a home and landscape where my ancestors had been rooted for generations, I was particularly strong by a feeling of displacement when I left that home. I realized that memory is a strong component of belonging, and began to see how familiarity affects vision; my relationship with a new landscape had no dimension because I did not know it. Knowing is more than simply looking.
<p>
   As I began writing <I>Home</I>,  I was keenly aware of the environmental problems facing the planet, and had been involved in coming to grips with these problems in various political ways. I began to feel that by using my own voice, by quietly but passionately sharing my love for the natural world, I might help to restore some degree of respect, and perhaps wonder for rocks, trees, spiders and grasses.
<p>
   I was deeply moved by Bill McKibben's book, <I>The End of Nature</I>, which I read as I was writing <I>Home</I> in a tiny cabin at the Banff Center in Alberta. I was participating in the Leighton Artist's Colony. From my many-windowed cabin, I could see a rocky ledge where, every afternoon, five or six elk would curl up and bask in the thin winter sunshine. On the day I was writing the chapter called 'Trees' - as I was about to describe my feelings about the hidden animals in the woods - a very real coyote trotted past my window. And at another moment, a young elk pressed her nose to the glass of my window and gazed wonderingly at me, making me feel that I was the caged animal.
<p>
   I wrote much of this book in my own house in the quiet countryside, in my studio that is a large room over the kitchen. Even though I was describing the place where I live, I was sad to finish the book, in the way that authors miss their characters; for, of course, it is as much a myth as a real place, a landscape of the mind, and, as such, is an attempt to capture my intense love for the spiritual quality that I feel in the wind, the storms, and the clear light of this place.
<p>
   I have written ever since I was a small child and feel that my love of words was fed by growing up in the country surrounded by dairy farms, without a television; and my grandfather, Sharon Brown, who was a professor of literature and poetry at Brown University, and who read poetry to us at most family gatherings. I spent much time alone and reading, and I spoke to myself in the third person (outloud, sotto voce) for much of my early childhood, telling myself the story of myself.
<p>
   I was extremely fortunate to have my years at Sarah Lawrence College coincide with those of E.L. Doctorow, who had just finished <I>The Book of Daniel</I>  and with whom I worked closely for a year. During that year, I wrote a novel and listened to his quiet and contemplative musings about the perils and joys of writing. Another major influence was the Canadian photographer Freeman Patterson, who opened the world of photography for me.
<p>
   <I>Home</I>  was always conceived as a combination of words and photographs and, in fact, I could not conceive the words until I had pondered my photographs and moved in the direction they sent me.

<H2>Ask Kitty</H2>
<br>
    Our smart, brilliant, sassy friend Ask Kitty not only is jargon-free, but she owns her own shadow and walks her own walk. We're just glad she checks her mail from time to time, or <b>george jr. </b> would be plum without her wisdom.

<hr width=80%>
  
<p>
<font size=+3>q.</font> I have a friend - well, ex-friend - who just stiffed me in the <BR>
business world. Do I respond, make a big deal about it, or chalk it up to
business.
<BR>
<font size=+3>a.</font> Sounds like you've already made up your mind.  I refer, of course, to the
fact that you call this friend an &quot;ex-friend.&quot;<BR>
Take a hint from all the mafia movies you've ever seen, and don't do
business with your friends or family.  It's too easy to make oversights in the name
of a special relationship that will haunt both your business dealings and
your relationships.  You could end up broke, friendless, dead, or with a
curse on the future generations of your family if you're not careful.<BR>
<p>
<font size=+3>q.</font> Who are you, Miss Kitty?
<br>
<font size=+3>a.</font> Just a cat who likes to think about stuff.
<p>
<font size=+3>q.</font> Do you think horoscopes are stupid?</B><BR>
<font size=+3>a.</font> I think microwave dryers, WalMart, the religious right, &quot;smart&quot;
cars, mall-walking, exercise videos, outer-outer belts, social climbing,
and concerns about one's waistline are stupid.  But horoscopes?  Naw.<BR>
 <p>
<font size=+3>q.</font>  Why is the really excellent stuff to eat rotten for you?</B><BR>
<font size=+3>a.</font> Oh, but it isn't!  I mean barring stuff with dangerous chemicals,
disease-producing
microorganisms, and the like, and considering that you don't have a
specific
medical condition that prevents you from eating certain foods, and that
you keep in mind how your eating habits affect the biosphere and your own
karma, you should eat what you want to eat.  I mean what's life without
a few french fries every once in a while?
<p>
<font size=+3>q.</font> I've read your comments, over the months, on Greek literature or
myths
<BR>
or whatever. Do you approve of fraternal societies, too?</B><BR>
a. I never had any brothers, but have always enjoyed the company of men.
<p>
<font size=+3>q.</font> Who are you going to vote for, for president, and why?</B><BR>
<font size=+3>a.</font> I'll write in George Jr.  Anyone who can be so swept up in the pursuit of
Right over Might can't be all that bad.  In fact, I've heard that his
legal
fees are mounting to equal the amount of a presidential campaign, if not
the national debt.  And who better to lead our troops into battle than
someone
who's willing to run with his chest out for the tape -- even at the
beginning
of the race?  He's fought the big guys, always keeping the interest of his
people foremost in his mind, and kept his head held high, even as the
arrows
are flying through the air.  And besides, he lets me write this column,
for free!
<p>
But I would never vote for you, gentle reader, because you can't tell an
object from a subject.

<h3> 'Homeboys' Launched</h3>

 <I>Homeboys in Outer  Space</I>, the new half-hour science fiction 
comedy focusing on the inter-galactic antics of spacemen Tyberious Walker 
(Flex) and Morris Clay (Darryl  M. Bell), two brothers from Earth, begins 
production today at The Walt Disney Studios. The series will run on UPN.
<br>     Rhona Bennett, Paulette Braxton, Kevin Michael Richardson and  
<I>Star Trek'</I>s James Doohan ("Scotty") in the recurring role of 
Pippen,  also star in this out-of-this-world comedy series, produced by 
Sweet Lorraine Productions in association with Touchstone Television.
<br>     The series is set in the 23rd century, where our heroes, Ty and 
Morris, are combing the galaxies in their Space Hoopty (a cross  between 
a space shuttle and a 1964 Chevrolet Impala), looking for odd jobs  and 
loose change.  On board their vehicle is a computer with a back-in-your- 
face personality named Loquatia (Bennett).  Loquatia has a crush on 
Morris causing her circuit boards to melt whenever he comes near,  but 
she has nothing but electrical shocks for Ty.
<br>  The guys' base of operation is the Jupiter Too, a bar run by Vashti, 
the Vognarian (Richardson). In addition to assorted aliens in all shapes  
and  sizes, one of their companions is the ravishing Amma (Braxton), a 
space mercenary for whom no mission is impossible -- for the right price. 
Promising.

<H3>Mall Rat Paid for Loitering</H3>
  Teen-age videogame  phenom  Michael Tang crashed in on the Mall of 
America and claimed a $25,000 college scholarship in the FuncoLand 
National Video Game  Championships(SM),  featuring
the PlayStation(TM) game console .
<p>
      A resident of Sunnyvale, Calif., Tang beat a field of 12 other 
finalists from around the country. Tang, who blew away the  competition  
in  the early rounds, was pressured by Jimmy Nguyen (17) from Houston, 
but  managed  to hold on to take the grand  prize.

<p>
      The tournament began August 5 with individual FuncoLand  store  
tournaments, with the winners advancing to regional competitions. Each  
of  the  finalists received a PlayStation game console, a $100 FuncoLand 
gift certificate,  a  copy of thejust-released PlayStation exclusive 
title, Crash Bandicoot,  and  a trip for two to that real swingville, 
Minneapolis. Now that's what we call a prize.

<h3>Print Still Has Stuff to Say About Pixels</h3>

    <I>Internet Voyager</I> magazine, billed as Your Monthly Guide to 
Navigating the Internet, is a handy (no freezes! no lost connections! no 
plug-ins required!) print journal loaded with helpful web-site reviews, 
features on access tools and productivity. The July ish offers its "Net 
Turkey" non-award to ChemSoft, which offers a quick-rich scheme on the 
web; and a dishonorable mention to Alan Gaynor, for his cosmetic-surgery 
site. "My fervent hope," says senior editor Dick Rubinstein, "is that the 
Net is an intelligent enough place that neither blatant fraud nor flashy 
self-promotion will get more than passing attention."
<p>
   <B>george jr.</B> has truly no time to surf, and quit it altogether 
back in June, so the <B>g. jr.</B> staff relies wholly on gee-williker 
genius Laura Logan's monthly Net Stars web-site reviews.

<h3>Not Fadeaway Issues Statement After Statement After Statement</B>
</h3>

  As the Summer Olympics were hosted in Atlanta, Not Fade Away  
Graphics presented the 1996 Lithuanian Basketball t-shirt inspired by  
the overnight success of the Lithuanian Basketball Team shirts of the 
1992 Olympics. Not Fade Away Graphics and the Grateful Dead joined forces 
 with  the Lithuanian Team and the Phoenix Suns to create a shirt 
featuring the  team colors with the trademark skull logo subtly worked 
into the graphic. 
 In  the Summer of 1992 the Lithuanian Basketball Team made their Olympic 
debut  as their country celebrated its new found independence from the 
Soviet  Union.  As the team lacked the financial backing that other 
Olympic athletes  enjoy, Sarunas Marciulionis, who was playing 
professional basketball for the  Golden State Warriors at the time, 
approached the Grateful Dead after seeing one  of their shows. In 
conjunction with the Grateful Dead and the  Golden  State
Warriors, Not Fade Away Graphics was asked to create and produce the  
team shirts used in practice sessions to prepare for the games. When the  
team  took the Bronze Medal, they wore the tie dyed t-shirts on the 
podium during the medals ceremony. The team's victory against the odds 
thrilled  the  sports world and the shirts became a runaway success. The 
media grabbed hold  of  the story and sales skyrocketed. Not Fade Away 
Graphics proudly donated  a  portion of the proceeds from the sale of 
each shirt to the Lithuanian Children's  Fund.
<p>
     While the Summer Games have come and gone, the controversy 
surrounding  the 1992 Lithuanian t-shirts is still alive. Greg Speirs, 
co-author of  the  1992 design, was employed as an artist by Not Fade 
Away when we were approached  by the Grateful Dead to do the project. As 
a long-time Dead licensee,  we  gladly accepted the challenge and Martin 
Leffer, President of Not Fade Away, set  to work with Greg Speirs to come 
up with the slam-dunking skeleton design  which became so popular. Mr. 
Speirs left the employ of Not Fade Away  shortly  after the 1992 Olympics 
to pursue a freelance career and proceeded to make a  claim against the 
company to stop the sale of the shirt. He maintained that  he  was not 
properly compensated or credited for the design and sought  damages.  Not 
Fade Away contended that Mr. Speirs was a staff artist at the time and 
operating under the "Work for Hire" provision of the Copyright Law (Title 
17, U.S. Code) and that the artwork was and is the sole property of  Not 
Fade Away who has the rights of copyrighting and merchandising. Not  Fade 
<p>
 Away Graphics does and has always held the registered copyright of this 
design.
<p>
      In an effort to settle the matter amicably, Not Fade Away entered 
into  an agreement with Mr. Speirs in November 1992 and paid him a lump 
sum for  his contribution to the design. In return, he agreed that he was 
not  entitled  to any of the copyrights or merchandising rights to the 
t-shirt. In  November  of 1995, Not Fade Away was served with a lawsuit 
filed by Greg Speirs asking  for monetary compensation of at least 
$500,000 for the 1992 design claiming  that Not Fade Away misrepresented 
the amount of shirts sold in the settlement agreement even though all 
accounting of the Lithuanian design had been reviewed and approved by all 
of the parties involved in its creation.
<p>
     In 1996 Lithuanian fever struck again as the Team was favored to win 
another medal. Not Fade Away Graphics, Liquid Blue (another  Dead  
licensee), the Grateful Dead and the Phoenix Suns joined forces creating 
a  merchandising team to help raise money for the Lithuanians and the REX 
Foundation, a  non- profit organization spearheaded by the Grateful Dead 
to help needy  charities,
by selling officially licensed products depicting the skull logo among  
other images such as skeletons playing basketball. Not Fade Away's  
"Steal  Your Face" net design created by staff artist Wayne Swarthout and 
the  "Backboard Rebounder" developed by our Art Director, Richard 
Gamache, were the  hottest selling items at the Olympics. Not Fade Away 
was again served  with  papers asking for injunctive relief against the 
sale of an "imposter t-shirt"  which Greg Speirs alleges is a direct 
rip-off of the 1992 design. The  shirt  in question was produced by 
Liquid Blue, in collaboration with the Grateful Dead, the Lithuanian Team 
and the Phoenix Suns with no intention of infringing  on another design.  
Not Fade Away did not sell the "imposter shirt" at the Olympics nor were 
we at any time contracted to participate in its  creation.
<p>
     The initial vision of the Lithuanian project was to help the  
orphaned children of the Baltic State by providing necessary food, 
clothing,  shelter and medical attention as well as setting up a 
basketball camp for other Lithuanian Olympic hopefuls. The idea of 
integrating skeletons  with  sports images is not new to the Grateful 
Dead as we introduced sports skeleton designs in 1985, pre-dating Greg 
Speirs' idea for the 1992 Lithuanian t-shirt.
Mr. Speirs has made no overtures to the Team or to the Grateful Dead 
indicating his interest in helping the cause through the proper  
licensing channels. Mr. Speirs has been notified by all parties to cease  
and  desist marketing the 1992 Lithuanian shirt through his company, Slow 
Leak Apparel, as it violates his settlement agreement with Not Fade Away. 
We  are  confident that this frivolous lawsuit will be dismissed as we 
continue to operate as  a legitimate licensee in the entertainment world. 
You got this far?

<H3>Alliance Benefits  Burned  Churches</H3>
    The  Nashville  Division  and  the Black Music Division of Warner 
Bros. Records  have  joined  with  Warner  Alliance in a campaign to 
raise money for the Burned Churches Building Fund, established and 
administrated by the National Council Of Churches.<BR>
     Spearheaded by Demetrus Alexander, VP  Gospel  Music,  Warner  
Alliance released a commercial five-song cassette  on  September  10  
entitled  <I>No Weapon.</I> The title track,  featuring  Beverly  
Crawford,  has  been  recently released to radio.  Other artists included 
on the compilation are Carlton Pearson, Andrae Crouch, The Winans  and  
The  Brooklyn  Tabernacle  Choir.  A portion of the proceeds will go to 
the building fund.<BR>
     Reverend Joan Brown Campbell, General Secretary  of  the  National  
Council  of Churches, said, "The burning of African American  churches  
is  no  longer  hidden. It is on the national agenda and Americans of 
good will are responding in unprecedented ways. They are morally outraged 
 and  ready  to  go  to  work."<BR>
      There are more than 55 churches (five burned in  August)  that  the 
National Council of Churches  has  targeted  for  rebuilding.  The  
Council's General Secretary for Public Policy,  Albert  Pennybacker,  
reported  that  the organization is trying to raise $12 million towards 
the cost of restoration.<BR>

<h3>Everybody  Sued By Writer Bill  Waid</h3>

  Bill Waid, a widely- published San Francisco writer, claims that 
his original screenplay,  "Launch Sequence," was the basis for the Walt 
Disney Company's 1995 release  <I>Crimson Tide. </I>A complaint was filed 
by Hollywood attorney Bruce Traney, August  19  in the Superior Court for 
the State of California, County of Los Angeles, alleging six causes of 
action.<BR>
     The Walt Disney Company is named as a defendant; also Hollywood  
Pictures Company; Buena Vista Pictures Distribution, Inc.; 
Simpson-Bruckheimer  Films; The Don Simpson Estate; Jerry Bruckheimer; 
Tony Scott; Bill Unger; Lucas Foster; Michael Moder; Michael Schiffer; 
Richard Henrick; Michael Stenson;  and others as yet unidentified parties 
designated as Does 1 through 200.<BR>
     Breach of Implied Contract is alleged; also, Intentional 
Interference  With Prospective Economic Advantage; Conversion; 
Accounting; Fraud and Deceit; Negligent Supervision Of Employees And/Or 
Agents.<BR>
     "Damage in an amount which cannot be ascertained at the present 
time,  but which is in excess of $1,000,000," is asserted by Traney.<BR>
     Waid, who served two years aboard a U.S. Trident-class nuclear  
submarine, wrote the screenplay "Launch Sequence," dealing with a nuclear 
 missile-launch crisis by such a vessel, which is the subject of "Crimson 
Tide."  He registered his screenplay with the Writers Guild of America 
April 20, 1989. Through his literary agent, Waid then arranged to have 
"Launch Sequence" submitted to approximately 120 production companies and 
production  executives.<BR>
     Waid says that because of the high interest in "Launch Sequence" he 
personally met with executives at Universal Pictures, Island Pictures,  
Geffen Films, Paramount Pictures, Pathe Films and Frank Yablans 
Productions. Particularly interested in "Launch Sequence," Waid contends, 
was Lucas  Foster, then of Frank Yablans Productions.  Mr. Foster later 
was listed as an executive producer of <I>Crimson Tide</I>.<BR>
     Traney states: "The Walt Disney Company and, in fact, all named 
defendants, are fully aware of Waid's claims, and the lawsuit filing 
should not surprise any of them."<BR>
     Waid has another screenplay soon to be marketed, and Traney believes 
 the lack of acknowledgement for<I> Crimson Tide</I> also detracts from 
Waid's opportunity to profit from his new film stories.<P>

directed by Mikael Salomon based on a screenplay by Graham  Yost about an 
armored car heist set against the backdrop of an impending  natural 
disaster facing a sleepy Midwestern river town.

<h3>Butt out, Collins</h3>


      The five members of the rock band Aerosmith confirmed that they 
were parting ways with Tim  Collins, their manager of 12 years. Aerosmith 
acknowledged the collective success that they have  shared with Collins 
and expressed the hope that he would continue to flourish
in his future endeavors.<br>
     In response to speculation over why the separation has occurred  and 
in order to reassure their fans, the band's only comment was: "Any 
inferences that members of the band have backslid into drug abuse is 
ludicrous. All we can say is that although we may be drinking  too  much 
coffee, our immediate plan is to complete our new Columbia album,  which 
we and the label are extremely proud and excited about, and get back out 
on the road."

 <h3>Old guy still trying</h3>

   Struggling phoenix Burt Reynolds (Striptease),  Don Cheadle (Devil in 
a Blue Dress), William H. Macy (Fargo), Heather  Graham (Drugstore 
Cowboy), John C. Riley (What's Eating Gilbert Grape), magician Ricky Jay, 
and Joanna Gleason have joined the ensembled cast  of New Line Cinema's 
dark comedy <I>Boogie Nights.</I><br>
      As previously reported, the film also stars Mark Wahlberg (Fear)  
and Julianne Moore (Nine Months).  Boogie Nights follows an extended 
family of filmmakers who struggle to redefine and revolutionize the  
adult entertainment industry.  Led by an idealistic producer who dreams 
of elevating his craft into an art form, the film takes a  
behind-the-scenes journey into the turbulent lives of those who rise and 
fall in  the misunderstood underworld. Written and directed by Paul  
Thomas  Anderson, the film will be released next April.<br>
      The film will feature a Capitol Records soundtrack infused with 
classic music form the 70's and 80's, representing the era which 
<I>Boogie Nights</I> chronicles.

<h3>Cutting-Edge 3D Game Programming with C++</h3>

  3D games are the most popular on the market, and best-selling games 
like Doom and Quake have redefined the game industry. Creating 
super-charged 3D games that impress consumers is difficult, and it 
requires the technical knowledge that, until now, was buried in obscure 
programming texts.  In <I>Cutting-Edge 3D Game Programming with C++</I> 
(Coriolis, $39.99), you'll find the detailed, advanced information to 
create computer games with 3D animation. <br>
   Paired with a CD-ROM full of game programming tools, this book covers 
all the hottest techniques, including 3D morphing, digital sound effects, 
collision detection, and more. Between these covers you'll find more than 
700 pages packed with the advanced game programming techniques you need 
to create blockbuster-quality games. <br>
   Master game programmer John De Goes gives you all the information and 
tools you need to write vivid, eye-popping 3D games.  The companion 
CD-ROM includes source code, 3D game programming tools, demos and other 
stuff.

<H2>shotgun movie review</H2>

<h4>by joseph r. blankenship</h4>

<blockquote>
    Hi folks.  Welcome.  I call this what it is because I'll discuss movies and moviemakers indiscriminately and randomly.  A complete layman's point of view.
<p>    It won't be unusual for me to praise Jackie Chan and Max von Sydow, or some other odd pairing in the same breath.  Anything goes.
<p>    Once in a while I may even devote a column to just one movie , director or actor.   I will review some films new to theaters but,  for the most part, I am interested in helping you discover and rediscover films that may not have grabbed your attention the first time around - new and older foreign releases as well as film classics from a fresh and not so high brow perspective.
   <p> In other words, if I don't like <I>Belle de Jour</I>, you'll know  it, despite what everyone else has been saying.
<p>      Granted, it's not the cleverest of segues, but the first film I'll review is  <I>Belle de Jour. </I> The 1967 French film by Luis Bunuel  was re-released in theaters and on video last year bearing the moniker of a modern classic.  Incidentally, I did like it.  Although it was not my favorite film of all time.  In it, Catherine Deneuve plays a bored housewife who turns to prostitution during the day (thus the title) to her and her husband's ruination.  I enjoyed Deneuve's daydream sequences, the most ironic of which appears at the end.  I also liked that it was a very sensual movie without blatant sex, nudity or even Mickey Roarke.  What I did not  like was that it was wrought with the emotional aloofness that French films are stereotypical known for.  If this is a point of contention, please contact me and provide examples as I'm always happy to be proven wrong.
<p>    In direct contrast to French erotic cinema is early German cinema.  On somewhat of a binge I watched <I>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, M</I>, and <I>Vampyr</I> back to back to back.
<p> My long suffering wife saw to it that <I>Sense and Sensibility</I> was rented soon after.
<p>      I was very eager  to see <I>Caligari </I>(1919) most because of all the hype heaped onto it over the years.  That Robert Weine's silent film was a pinnacle of Germany's expressionist period and that it was just plain creepy.  The film involves a man's encounter with a carnival sideshow man, Dr. Caligari, and his somnambulist, Cesare, who he suspects of mass murder.  Consequently, his pursuit of Caligari leads to the audience's realization of his own madness and detainment in an asylum.  I like the storyline as well as the hallucinogenic set design.  I can also see where<I> Batman</I> director Tim Burton is influenced by this period in cinema: Danny Devito's Penguin looked much more like Caligari than the comic book villain.
<p>      Creepier than<I> Caligari</I> was <I>Vampyr </I>(1931).  Carl Dreyer's film about protagonist, Allan Gray's excursion into an occult laden, nightmarish dreamscape is a bit difficult to follow with its, at best, sparse dialogue.  The film is all atmosphere and it is exactly that atmosphere which makes it worth watching.  Anyone who appreciates the faux-gothic scene going on now could take a history lesson form this bit of dark surrealism.  Though not as widely known as <i>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</i> and a flop upon its release in theaters, <i>Vampyr</i> is today considered a classic of early horror.
<p>      My favorite of the lot, so far, is Fritz Lang's <I>M</I> (1931).  Lang is probably best known to casual movie viewers as the maker of the silent sci-fi classic, Metropolis.  However, he made films all the way up to and including 1960.  M, Lang's first talkie, stars Peter Lorre as a child murderer stalking the streets of Dusseldorf, with both the police and members of the criminal underworld racing to capture him for vastly different reasons.  The impassioned debate at the film's climax over Lorre's fate is worth the price of rental.  Also striking is Lang's use of symbolism in describing the murders and the very effective portrayals by both Lorre and the almost gestapo-like mob boss, Schranker, played by Gustaf Grundgens.
<p>      What's most fascinating to me about early German cinema is that while America turned out costume epics, musicals and escapist fare, German film makers moved the camera away from spectacle and turned it inward toward the dark underbelly of the human psyche.
<p>      Switching gears again, in fact toward said American escapism, I have only one new film to talk about this time around.  Being 13 years old and male in 1981, it was hard to miss John Carpenter's <I>Escape from New York</I>.  To me, the lead character, Snake Plissken, was always much cooler than either <I>Indiana Jones</I> or<I> Rambo</I>.  When Escape came out, I was just getting tired of Star Wars toys.  Who would have thought that I'd have a wife, kid and a mortgage before Kurt Russell, who hasn't aged a bit, would finally put back on his eye patch and sneer for <I>Escape from L.A</I>.  While there are no real surprises in this film, I must admit that I kind of like it that way.  Basically, <I>L.A</I> is <I>New York </I>with earthquakes, surfing and a more comic book feel to it.  Hmm, sort of like  real life.  Anyway, I welcomed the return of a childhood hero and had a great time watching this film. However, it is easy to see that in light of director, John Carpenter's track record of late, he and producer, Debra Hill as well as Kurt Russell did not want to mess with the successful Escape formula.
<p>      I'm always open to other opinions and discussions on film, as well as suggestions on fare that I may not have yet stumbled upon.  Drop <!-- MailTo Tag --><A HREF="MAILTO:JoeB@georgejr.com">me</A> a line. Talk to you next month.

<B>The intro:</B>
<P></P>  Welcome to the November issue of<B> george jr.</B>, the internet monthly that dogs and kestrals hear zipping through the modem long before any other kind of sentient being even can hear a <a href="whistle.html">whistle</a>.
<P></P>Once again, we bring you an international jamboree of writing talent, book talk, split hairs, curious links and digitized comfort. We are not any Tom, Dick or any other George; we are only this one, because our vastly different DNAs deem it so.
<P></P>This month, we includes Q&As with Chinese painter and writer <B>Belle Yang</B>, mystery writer<B> Robert Crais</B> and futurist <B>James Halperin.</B> Just after Halperin's Q&A, you'll note an alluringly named link called <B>Everything's Future</B>. This, dear reader, is Halperin's time line of our future. Stand back and hold hands with your friends, because it's going to get a little rough.
<P></P><B>Stanley Crawford</B> is back with us again, offering bold advice to his loved ones; and <B>Ask Kitty</B> has some oblique responses for, we presume, <b>george jr</b>.'s readers, who sure do love the email button. <B>Oliver North</B>'s secret e-mails get no prettier in our <b>White House E-mail</b> department, so we offer a fresh selection of them each Sunday.  Filing two more reports from literature's front lines, Ace Correspondent <B>Nicholas A. Basbanes</B> this November writes about novelists <B>William Kennedy</B> and uni-namer <B>Sapphire</B>.
<p>
November's cover art is <b>Guy Davenport</b>'s acrylic "Ford, Joyce, 
Pound and Quinn," one of dozens of Davenport's paintings and drawings 
reproduced in  Eric Anderson Reece's fascinating book about Davenport's 
splendid artwork, <i>A Balance of Quinces</i> (copyright 1996 by Guy 
Davenport, and reproduced in <b>george jr.</b> courtesy of Reece and 
Davenport's publisher, New Directions). 

<P></P> Apart from some <a href="sarcasm.html">very mild sarcasm</a>  every now and then, <b>george jr.</b> has nothing to feel uneasy about, though the citizenry does. With them - i.e., you - in mind, we've given over<B> the uneasy chair </B>to Pulitzer Prize winner <b>James MacGregor Burns.</b>
<P></P>Because sentiment and nostalgia sets in  at  the most unlikely of hours, we offer the item called<B> Mania</B>, which you'll clock to  soon enough. Likewise, Sources. Enjoy.
<P>You have their numbers and you have<A HREF="http://www.coil.com/~gmyers/"> mine</A>. Don't forget to call me, Ishmael.
<P></P>
<B>The outro:</B>
<P></P>We thank you for your cards and letters, and herewith answer, as succinctly as possible, the longstanding question as to the identity of  team <B>george jr.</B>:

<H2>q&a</H2> 
<h3>belle yang:  the odyssey of a Manchurian</h3>

<P>
<IMG SRC="/november/yang.jpg" WIDTH=220 HEIGHT=148 HSPACE=15 ALIGN=left>

Belle Yang's first book, <I>Baba: A Return to China Upon My Father's Shoulders,</I> received tremendous praise when it was first published in 1994.<I> The Los Angeles Times Book Review</I> called it "glorious...and captivating."  and <I>The San Jose Mercury News</I> said "this remarkable book...is a pure delight to relish through both eye and ear."
<P></P>  Picking up where<I> Baba</I> ("Father" in Chinese) left off, Belle Yang continues his story of survival in <I>The Odyssey of a Manchurian  </I>(Harcourt Brace, $35), starting with the flight from his native village during the civil war that engulfed China and ending with his arrival in Taiwan where he would hope to finally find peace. 
<P></P>   Like her first book,<I> The Odyssey of a Manchurian</I> is lavishly illustrated with 20 full-color paintings. As World War II comes to an end, a battle for power erupts between Mao Zedong's Communists and the Nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-Shek, 17-year-old Baba, trusting neither side, decides to leave both Manchuria and his family behind.
<P></P>   As he travels south from the ancient capital of Beijing, to the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers, to Shanghai  and eventually to Taiwan, he is consumed by the exodus from the Communist takeover: avoiding soldiers, battling hunger, and encountering hordes of ordinary people without political agendas who found themselves swept into the madness of revolution.
<P></P> Belle Yang was born in Taipei, Taiwan in 1960.  She lived in Japan from 1965 to 1967 and emigrated to the United States with her parents when she was seven.  She now lives in Carmel, California.


<br clear=all>
<hr width=80%>

<blockquote>

<font size=5>q. </font> What first gave you the idea to tell Baba's story through both  words and pictures?
<BR>

<font size=5>a. </font> Chinese painters are poets and poets are painters.  Chinese written characters are pictographs.  Word and image are one.  Since childhood, I have watched my father paint and grace his work with poetry.
<p>

<font size=5>q. </font> Do you feel that there are some parts of Baba's story better  told through your paintings?
<BR>

<font size=5>a. </font> The writing can stand alone, but the images help to heighten the tension.  The background of<I> Baba</I> and<I> The Odyssey of a Manchurian </I> is the darkness of war.  The art is bright - even humorous and pretty. The contrast somehow darkens even the dark.
<p>

<font size=5>q. </font> How do you decide what parts of the story to express through  your painting?
<BR>

<font size=5>a. </font>  A tough question because there are a slew of answers.  In <I>The Odyssey of a Manchurian,</I> I chose, in most cases, to illustrate the flashbacks to the lyrical images of childhood. The images are not necessarily illustrations, but symbolic, representative of the mood or the central idea of that particular chapter.
<p>

<font size=5>q. </font> Which story that your father told most affected you?
<BR>

<font size=5>a. </font> Perhaps Chapter 4, the part I call "A Dream." It is the core philosophy of Chinese thinking: that life is but a dream, a bubble, lightning, morning dew, ephemeral, changeable.  The stories are equally wonderful and equally necessary in the telling of China of the 30's-50's; they flow into one another and is history.
<p>


<font size=5>q. </font> How do you go about preparing this book?  Do you listen to  your father's complete story and then go back and paint or do  you paint as work on each chapter?
<BR>

<font size=5>a. </font> In my first book, I listened, I painted then I wrote.  In this second book of my trilogy, I listened to each story, wrote the chapter then painted the accompanying image, alternating between writing and painting to keep both activities fresh.  In my third book, which I am currently working on, I've listened to my father's stories, set down all the material, and will paint as I complete the second draft of each chapter.
<p>

<font size=5>q. </font> What has changed in you and your father's relationship now  that you have completed the second part of his life story?
<BR>

<font size=5>a. </font> My father has "forgiven" me all the "mistakes" of my twenties.  he now sees my antics and the troubles of my earlier days as necessary to my artistic journey.  I've come to see the child in my father and no longer rage against his imperfections.  I now understand how the war had shaped him.  There is so much humor and laughter between father and daughter today.

<p>

<font size=5>q. </font>  How did returning to China for three years to study painting  influence your work?
<BR>

<font size=5>a. </font>  The repression in China made me realize the freedom I had.  I came back certain that I did not want to remain silent.  Through my writing/painting I give one great big shout:  I'm alive!
   Chinese art helped me to see the world from multiple perspectives instead of from the classical Western one-point perspective.  I also move through the stories as one would view a horizontal scroll of a landscape, mountains unrolling into mountains and rivers winding into rivers.
<p>

<font size=5>q. </font> Elsewhere you have said that you found being both artist and writer liberating. 
<BR>

<font size=5>a. </font> Writing is tough. It drains me. When I tire of bleeding out words, I pick up the brush and, oh, how easy and comforting and "mindless."  When painting becomes too facile, I crave the hard-edged challenge of writing.

<h3>robert crais: confronting the system </h3>

<P>
<IMG SRC="/november/craisqa.gif" WIDTH=142 HEIGHT=220 HSPACE=15 ALIGN=left>

   Louisiana-born Robert Crais is the award-winning author of the best-selling Elvis Cole novels, which include <i>The Monkey's Raincoat, Stalking the Angel, Lullaby Town, Free Fall</i> and <i>Voodoo River.</i> His latest is <i>Sunset Express </i>(Hyperion). 
   Crais has written TV scripts for <i>Hill Street Blues, Cagney & Lacey, Miami Vice</i> and <i>L.A. Law. </i> He won an Emmy for his work on <i>Hill Street Blues.</i><i>The Monkey's Raincoat </i>won both an Anthony Award and a Macavity Award.
   The interview:


<br clear=all>
<hr width=80%>

<blockquote>
<font size=5>q. </font>In <I>Sunset Express</I> you paint a pretty dark picture of the legal system, especially the way that wealthy defendants have an unfair advantage.  Do you believe this inequality affects the whole country, or Los Angeles in particular?
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font> Well, we certainly have our share of headline cases here -- the Menendez brothers, O.J. -- but the plague of lawyers is not limited to L.A., and didn't just happen.  Lawyers control Washington.  Lawyers control business and the news media.  Lawyers are responsible for our huge insurance premiums and this hyper-litigious society we have.  Lawyers are also responsible for a so-called "justice system" where, for example, rich people hire lawyers whose specific goal isn't to seek truth or justice, but to confuse and befuddle emotionally weak jurors so that we can't even convict two guys who admitted murdering their parents.</B>
<P>


<font size=5>q. </font> A-ha. Is that why you chose to make the villain an attorney, and have Elvis Cole confront the legal system?  
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font> Like most people, I'm frustrated by all of this.  On the one hand, I certainly want the rights of innocent people protected -- that's where defense attorneys serve a noble and worthwhile service -- but at the same time I'm enraged by a system that allows clearly guilty -- objectively guilty -- people to walk free.  I think the entire country feels powerless, and <I>Sunset Express </I> offers an outlet both for myself and my readers to deal with the feelings of grief and anger they experience.  Elvis does what the rest of us wish we could -- he digs into one of these high-profile criminal defense attorneys and reveals what we all suspect to be true but can't get close enough to prove: that many of these people are motivated by arrogance and greed, and that at their core they are amoral.
</B>
<P>

<font size=5>q. </font>It's been said that your novels have enormous appeal to women, who have become the largest segment of mystery readers.  What's your magic touch?
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font> A bookseller recently called to ask me to sign at her store, and told me that I'm the most popular male author among her female readers.  I asked her why she thought that was so, and she said, "It comes across in your work that you like women." Well, I do.  My life is filled with smart, bright, complex women after whom I model my characters.  I work very hard to make my female characters believable and true and complete, just the way the women in my life are believable and true and complete.  Besides, all these smart, bright women in my life are also very strong, and would beat the hell out of me if I didn't. </B>
<P>

<font size=5>q. </font> So often in fiction, art imitates life.  Your wife is a clinical psychotherapist who, I've heard, you consult for  insight into the motivations of your characters.
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font> That's right.  She calls herself Motivations-R-Us.  Seriously, I love people's idiosyncrasies and I work very hard at creating characters who are interesting and authentic.  So, for me, having a practicing psychotherapist across the dinner table is like being a kid in a candy store -- we have these marvelous hours-long pinball conversations about why people do the things they do.  As for art imitating life, well, in <I>Sunset Express </I> Elvis seeks Lucy Chenier's expertise in the legal profession to help him understand lawyers.  Maybe the reason Elvis's and Lucy's relationship seems so natural is that it echoes the relationship in my own marriage.
</B>
<P>

<font size=5>q. </font> Why do you refuse to option your books to television and movies?
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font> All of the television networks and many of the film studios have tried to buy the rights to these things, but I couldn't do that to Elvis!  Look, Elvis Cole doesn't exist on the page -- he exists in the hearts and minds of my readers, and every one of my readers contributes to him. He doesn't come to life until he's read.  I used to think it would be neat to have Elvis on the screen, but if I committed Elvis to film I'd lose the reader from the equation and I simply will not do that.  Elvis wouldn't be Elvis any more -- he'd be an actor.</B>
<P>


<font size=5>q. </font>I've heard your hobbies include acrobatic flying.  Do you, like your boy Elvis Cole, seek out danger? 
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font>  I don't see these things as dangerous.  Exciting, maybe, and definitely fun, but more importantly they are opportunities to learn about and develop one's self.  If there is an element of danger, then that's the price you pay for the fun of spinning and looping an airplane.  Elvis probably feels the same way: he likes to help people, and if he sometimes faces danger in order to help them, then that's the price of doing what he likes.
</B>
<P>

<font size=5>q. </font> Are you Elvis Cole? 
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font> Elvis is the man I try to be.  I think that's a pretty good goal.</B>

<h3>james l. halperin: truth or dare</h3>

<P>
<!--IMG SRC="/november/halperin2.gif" WIDTH=175 HEIGHT=188 HSPACE=15 ALIGN=left-->

   James L. Halperin's speculative novel of the future<I> The Truth Machine </I>($24)  was initially published in cyberspace. Since then, Del Rey has reissued it in meat space - and too many of Halperin's edgy predictions look like they're coming to pass, and everyone knows who is telling the truth.
<p>
Can you imagine never having to worry whether someone is lying? Once perfected, "the truth machine" of the novel changes the face of civilization. Crime, violent behavior and court cases are eliminated overnight. And political candidates - well, suddenly there are fewer of them. The interview:

<br clear=all>
<hr width=80%>

<blockquote>

<font size=5>q. </font>  What is <I>The Truth Machine</I> about?
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font> Basically, it's a futuristic story - I call it a speculative novel -  about a machine that can unfailingly assess whether a person is telling the  truth.  I wanted to get people thinking about issues that I think might  actually affect our survival as a species.  In my novel I envision a world  creeping ever more steadily toward self-destruction, which can be averted only  by people willingly giving up some of their liberties - a portion of their  right to privacy.  A truth machine that could detect lies with 100-percent accuracy would eliminate crime, violence, and civil litigation.  It  would affect everything we know, from politics to business to education.
<p>
<IMG SRC="/november/grinds.gif" WIDTH=220 HEIGHT=269 HSPACE=15 ALIGN=right>

<font size=5>q. </font>  Where did you get the idea for this?
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font> Most of us wonder what tomorrow's innovations will be.  Will they improve  our lives, hasten our end?  What year will an AIDS vaccine be invented?  When  will cryogenic freezing become legal?  When will commercial supersonic airline  flights across the U.S. be introduced?  When will we colonize the moon?
<br>

And then I began to wonder what it would be like to live in a world in which no  one could lie.  And I realized that if someone could build a fool-proof lie  detector, it would be the most important invention in history.  A truth machine  would create some interesting controversies,  but, more importantly,  it could  actually solve many of the most intractable problems that now exist in  politics, science, justice and many other fields. 
<p>
<font size=5>q. </font> <I>The Truth Machine </I>first was published, by yourself,  Mark Twain style, but in cyberspace.  What about the stuff that awaited browsers there?

<br>
<font size=5>a. </font> My book was on my Web site for anyone to read, but there was a slight  catch.  You had to answer some questions.  After filling in your name and  e-mail address, there's a series of questions.  "Suppose for one minute that  there's a technology  breakthrough.  This breakthrough results in a truth  machine.  This device is far more sophisticated than a lie detector.  Do you  think a truth machine would benefit mankind?  Do you wish there were a truth  machine?" And then you get the novel.  Actually, there are questionnaires along  the way, asking a variety of demographic questions.
<p>
<font size=5>q. </font>  And what was the purpose of this information-gathering?
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font>It was for marketing purposes.  The information I gathered was to help  market the book.  When I start reading the responses, I'll know the professions  of the people who like the book, I'll know how old they are, I'll know whether  they would be interested in seeing a <I>Truth Machine</I>  movie or participating in a  chat group.  The Internet as a communications tool and marketing tool has  enormous potential.  All I've done is combine two simple techniques - writing  a book and posting it on the 'Net, and taking the opportunity to ask people to  fill out questionnaires along the way.  Whether the story's on screen or paper,  though, the best thing a writer can offer is still a good compelling read.
<p>
<font size=5>q. </font> James, James, James, James. Do you think a truth machine is technologically possible?
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font>  Well, the fax machine was actually invented during the 1800s, but it didn't  become financially viable until the last decade.  On the other hand, when the  space race against the Soviet Union made it politically popular to put men on  the moon, NASA did so in 1969 on less computing power than you probably have on  your desk today.  I researched the notion of a truth machine with scientists,  business colleagues and experts, and I believe it is indeed possible to build a  truth machine, but it would probably take 50 to 100 years to build.

With the national presidential elections practically history, the 
leadership styles and abilities of candidates Bill Clinton and Bob Dole 
have been under close scrutiny from other politicians, the media and the 
American public.
In choosing a candidate, voters always are faced with many questions: 
What makes a great leader? Do either the Republican or Democratic 
candidates exhibit great leadership? What do we, the people, require of 
our leaders as we stand at the turn of the century? Does our political 
system allow for the kind of leadership we expect from public servants? 
Can we count on politicians, who want to be elected and re-elected, to 
lead in our best interests?
 <p>



James MacGregor Burns  is one of the nation's best-known and prolific 
scholars of American political history. The Pulitzer Prize-winning author 
of many books of political history including <I>The Power to Lead</I> 
(1984); <I>Roosevelt: The Soldier of Freedom</I>
(1970, for which he won the Prize); and<I> Government By the People,</I> 
a widely used American college text since 1951, Burns has spoken with 
most of the important politicians of our time.
 

<P>

Burns is generally considered to be one of the  foremost experts on 
political leadership. He is Woodrow Wilson Professor of Government, 
Emeritus, at Williams College; and Senior Scholar, Center for Political 
Leadership and  Participation at the University of Maryland at College 
Park.

<blockquote>


<font size=5>q. </font> What makes a good leader?  Is there a formula for 
effective leadership style?

<br>


<font size=5>a. </font> Commitment, conviction, strong purpose; all 
grounded in a set of explicit values.
<p>
<font size=5>q.</font> How does a politician's personal values, or morality, fit 
into the scheme of leadership? Is "good character" necessary to being a 
good leader?<br>
<font size=5>a. </font>I think there are two levels of values.  One is 
what you might call "public values." These are the great American values 
like liberty, equality, justice, community that I think relate to all of 
us in the nation.  The other set is what you might call "ethical values," 
which are much more personal.  These present the ethical questions of how 
we deal with one another: Do we interact with honesty, with trust, with 
responsibility?
<P>
<font size=5>q. </font> Do public values and ethical values together make 
up what you have called "real and total character"?

<br>


<font size=5>a. </font> Again, there are two kinds of character.  One 
kind of leadership character is that of a leader who makes commitments, 
and, in terms of basic, accepted values, tries to live up to those 
commitments, fights for these values, and shows his or her character 
through that kind of commitment. The other level of character, is of 
those people who may not feel so strongly about the great values like 
liberty, equality and justice. They feel more strongly about personal 
ethics and personal behavior. Ideally, leaders ought to combine the two 
levels. They should be great believers in public values, but they should 
also be great believers in personal character and ethical behavior. I 
think you can say that George Washington combined belief in the great 
public values and in personal values, what might be called virtues.

<P>


The problem arises when the two levels clash, when a leader is pursuing 
great public values and feels that he or she must violate certain 
personal values.


<P>


<font size=5>q. </font> You've made the distinction between two different 
kinds of leaders, and you have said that President  Clinton's problem was 
that he hadn't  "decided what kind of leader he wants to be - a broker 
who wheels and deals or a visionary who takes a strong stand and sticks 
to it" (AARP Bulletin, November, 1994). Do you still feel this way about 
President Clinton?

<br>



<font size=5>a. </font> Well, I think this is a question about what kind 
of strategic leader you want to be. He does believe in certain great 
values but I think it comes down, for him, to more of a tactical 
situation: to what extent do you fight for your values, such as justice 
and fairness for the poor even though fighting for them may be 
politically unpopular. Clinton is a good example of someone who does have 
strong public values, but is not willing to risk defeat by pursuing these 
values as strongly as he might. The now-classic example is the welfare 
bill he signed.


<P>

And that raises another great political question: to what extent do you 
want to follow the people, follow the crowd, and always try for 
electability, or reelectibility? 

<P>

To what extent do you take the plunge and fight for something you believe 
in even though it's not very popular.  I don't think Clinton has resolved 
this issue. I think he wants to do the
right thing, but above all, he fears defeat.  In American politics, 
defeat is a very serious matter. The American public is not very kind to 
people who lose.


<P>


<font size=5>q. </font> Do you feel that President Clinton's leadership 
style has changed? What about his recent and continuing intervention in 
attempting to restore peace in the Middle East? Is there a difference 
between his domestic leadership and his international leadership?


<br>



<font size=5>a. </font>

 I do think that he's learned a lot from experience. I think the whole 
White House has become better organized, more deliberate, more effective 
in planning ahead. They've been better to sticking with their path in 
dealing with the Middle East and Haiti - you have a sense of continuous 
effort, but that is a separate thing from willingness to make a 
commitment, that is the right thing to do, but is politically unpopular.


<P>


<font size=5>q. </font> Political scientists have long discussed whether 
politicians should serve as agents for the will of the people, or if they 
should act as trustees, directed by their own personal interests. Do you 
think that leaders today are more like agents of a collective opinion, or 
more like individuals with good taste?

<br>


<font size=5>a. </font> The short answer is a question: do you do what 
the majority of the people want you to do, or do you do what you think is 
right? I think the people want the politicians to do what they think is 
right. They choose people who maybe even go against the peoples' 
interests because the people feel the politicians are doing something 
right. So it's not just a question of following the people. It's a 
question of leading the people.


<P>


<font size=5>q. </font> Can you compare the leadership styles of 
President Clinton and candidate Bob Dole, given this framework of 
leadership? Has Dole come to a better understanding of leadership? Has he 
better resolved this conflict between leading and following?

<br>


<font size=5>a. </font> The way that I differentiate between Dole and 
Clinton is through a concept we in political science call the difference 
between the "transforming" leader and the "transactional" leader. The 
transforming leader is the kind of person we've been talking about here, 
who wants to make basic changes, who's willing to risk unpopularity to 
try to make those changes. In contrast, there's the transactional leader, 
who is much more of a broker, much more of a conciliator, a mediator, a 
transactor. This kind of politician is typically not so much interested 
in fundamental change as
in simply being a broker among contending interests.  The transactional 
leader is constantly mediating between factions. This is a very important 
kind of leadership. 

<P>

It's really what keeps the system going because we're constantly trying 
to get agreement among different people. Since we have such a separated 
form of government, we desperately need these kinds of leaders.


<P>

I think Dole is the consummate transactional leader, in that he will know 
how to deal with both parties in the House and in the Senate. He'll know 
how to deal with the various interest groups, and he'll be very adroit on 
that score. But this raises basic leadership questions because the 
transactional leader is a very special kind of leader.  It's a very 
restricted, though very crucial role to play. You're really following 
other
people all the time, bringing people together; you're a compromiser -- 
you get people to compromise. That's a far cry from the transforming 
leader who has a vision of basic change.


<P>


<font size=5>q. </font> Would you characterize Clinton as a transforming 
leader? <br>
<font size=5>a. </font> I once talked to him about this. I think he wants 
to be a transforming leader but has discovered that the American 
political system makes it very difficult to do that. The system 
constantly calls for the broker.


<p>


<font size=5>q. </font>In your book <i>The Deadlock of Democracy: Four 
Party Politics in America,</i>  you discuss the problem of political 
gridlock. Do you think that leaders have perpetuated this gridlock or 
tried to overcome it? In other words, is gridlock a cause of failed 
leadership, or a result of failed leadership?

<br>


<font size=5>a </font>I think failures of leadership in this country 
are, to a great extent, the result of our gridlocked system. We have an 
anti-leadership system, an anti-transforming leadership system, but it's 
a system that is pro-transactional leadership. Leaders  can claim that 
the system makes it very difficult to bring about major, planned change. 
Have they done anything about the system? The answer is, no. Anytime you 
talk to
politicians about fundamental change,  like constitutional change, they 
say it's too hot too handle. They think it's sacred, or they think the 
people think it's sacred. They essentially accept an anti-leadership 
system even though it makes their own leadership so difficult.


<P>


<font size=5>q. </font> What about women in leadership? I know that one 
of your main focuses has been on women leaders. Where do you think women, 
as leaders, are positioned in our culture? Are they transactional or 
transforming leaders? Are they allowed to be leaders at all? You said 
that women are able to bring "nurturing and caring and compassion and 
communal qualities or emphases" to the political arena (<i>Dallas Morning 
News</i>, May 1993). Are women only allowed to participate in that sphere 
of leadership? Can leadership be gender neutral?

<br>


<font size=5>a. </font> I am particularly interested in leadership by 
women; it's part of my general interest in leadership. I think the 
American system is particularly hard on women because the American 
system, with its divided powers, builds so much petty conflict into the 
system that it's not something that women leaders, on the whole, 
naturally take to. Now there are women leaders who are much tougher than 
men, such as former Prime Minister of Britain Margaret Thatcher.

<P>


But I do think that women bring different qualities to politics than men, 
on the whole. And I think they find that this super-competitive system is 
incredibly hostile and mean-spirited. I think women, on the whole, find 
this exceedingly difficult. I think women in particular have a stake in 
fundamental change of the system.

      In george jr.'s second excerpt from <i>Some Instructions to My Wife . . .</i>(Dalkey Archive Press, $11.95), Stanley Crawford shows why his book is a classic lampoon of sanctimonius family manuals - especially of the type once so reverred by  the Victorians.

To My Daughter Concerning the Conduct of Her Childhood
<p>
<b><font size=5>Chapter 11:</font></b> The Husband. Thus I do not advise you to explore the path of life, unlike
 your Brother. For yours will be rather to guard over the secret life of the house, which itself can be said to 
represent the secret life of life itself, hidden away, and it will be 
better to wait in that house, perfecting the arts of housekeeping, for that
 day when your future Husband will arrive fresh from the path of life in his
 new car, up the driveway, and climb out and march up to the front door to
<IMG SRC="/november/child.gif" WIDTH=220 HEIGHT=288 HSPACE=15 ALIGN=left>
 announce himself with a firm knock. You may of course invite him in-I will stand not far off, or crouch, under the sink, repairing a leaky connection. As he steps inside the door and gives you a smile, you will do well to look over his features in a general way at first and then to inspect them one by one individually, beginning with his teeth. Are they even, with a good bite, and not discolored by nicotine or from the effects of chewing or inhaling other drugs? His mouth is open-check his breath. Is there a rank emanation, suggesting a future of gum or tonsil problems? Further, does he respond promptly and directly to your questions, or does he have trouble hearing them or understanding them or otherwise making sense of them, as indicated by the manner in which he answers them, whether confused, evasive, or nonsensical? Does he lie? Does he laugh too quickly without apparent cause? Does he stumble about and fall down? Drunk? Stoned? These and other questions you would do well to ask silently at once in order to begin to know whether this is the young man who deserves you as his Wife and me as his Father-in-Law, not to speak of your Mother as Mother-in-Law, your Brother as Brother-in-Law.      
<p>       There are other questions as well, and though they may seem to touch on matters of only minor or passing interest, their answers can often reveal much more than the heavier and more ponderous questions such as What is truth or Who is God? And by these I mean, look at his ears for example, and notice whether they are turning color as he talks; listen to his chest to ascertain whether he wheezes (indicating asthma) or suffers from shortness of breath, windiness, or other conditions of the lungs and bronchial tubes. 
<p>    You will be sure to observe his shoulders, whether they are thrown back squarely or are unduly hunched forward, and whether his arms hang squarely and are of equal length. Does his stomach growl? If so, is this a temporary condition resulting from poor judgement, or is it a chronic or permanent one that will keep you awake at night and embarrass your guests? Are his habits regular? His liver? Kidneys? Are his legs of equal length, like his arms, and stout and well fleshed out, or weak and spindly? Will his loins do the job? Do his feet appear flat? And of his conversation may it be said that he is able to discourse upon foreign and domestic affairs at length without boring his listeners and that he is able to speak articulately of his travels, which ought to be extensive, while yet acknowledging freely the still uncharted regions of his own ignorance? Does he have a trade, a skill, a profession-and preferably all three? Ask to see his diplomas. Has he been previously married or otherwise attached? Children, legitimate, illegitimate? If so how does he propose to support all of you at once? And so on.
<p>	Perhaps you would do better to look at your future Husband not so much as a man but as a horse-the powerful steed whom you will someday mount and on whose back you will dash across the meadows and fields and bound up the sides of the highest mountains: for he must be well saddled and bridled and properly cinched up for you to get the best performance out of him, the greatest speed, the highest leaps-for you ride a ride (as in a dream) until finally a knee goes or he begins to pant too hard or-as has been known to happen-he simply drops dead beneath you.

Don, I am more than a little disturbed by yr note for the following 
reasons:
(1)  I have had no "recent appearances" on the hill
(2)  At what is referred to as "early middle age" I have few            
illusions about the meaning of the word "friends." I would point out that 
if these persons were friends, they would have called me, not you.
Given the points above, it would be good if we talked.  There is much to 
be done and very little timein which to do it.  This kind of business 
simply impedes progress when we need it most.

possibly Inouye.
I don't know if Ollie will recommend a sequence for the calls or not -- 
but it is very important that Lugar be called first.  Lugar has been very 
helpful on this issue and has been trying hard to bring the bill up on 
the Senate floor.  JMP should ask Lugarfo his advise before proceeding 
with the additional calls.  Please keep us apprised.

SUBJECT: Saudi arms
Lynn Sachs is checking with Lugar's staff on the basis of his optimistic 
assessment.  Hope to have an answer shortly.  Again, I suspect Lugar made 
a seat of the pants judgement.  If he had taken a head count, he would 
have gone to Dole at some point, and he obviously did not. 
  On the idea of notifying the whole package, then dropping MSIP, 
ALQ-171, and Blackhawks, I am pessimistic because:
 - the pressure wd be to drop out the missiles.
 - whatever was dropped out would be next to impossible to notify later 
this year.
 - it makes the President look weak and would be interpreted exactly that 
way in the Mideast.
 Have checked with Dick Murphy who also agrees we should not withdraw 
part of the package for the above reasons.

NOTE FROM: OLIVER NORTH
Subject: PRIVATE BLANK CHECK
Ref the Presidential speech for Sunday: Am very concerned that we may be 
coming to a serious problem w/ the televised speech. In accord w/ earlier 
guidance, we worked very closely w/ Ben Elliot to build a speech aimed at 
Congressional passage of the President's proposal to the Congress. With 
some tinkering, the draft Ben provided will do just that. It is aimed at 
the Congress -- thru the American people - and presents the issues in 
terms that they grasp in a non-partisan way on an issue of extraordinary 
national security importance. For whatever reason, Pat Buchanan had Tony 
Dolan do another draft. This alternative version is long on fear, 
anecdotal remarks and no clear end -- except that the Democrats should be 
blamed when it goes wrong. It practically assumes that the initiative 
will be voted down.

I believe -- right or wrong -- that we have a group at work here who are 
more intent on the 1988 elections than a democratic outcome in Nicaragua. 
You know that I feel very strongly about this -- or I wd not bother you 
by coming directly to you. I believe that this may well be our last 
chance to keep from having our sons -- and maybe you and I -- go to war 
in Central America. If we lose this vote because others were more intent 
on blaming the Democratic party/liberals for a disaster, this country 
will truly suffer irreparable damage. With some work, Ben Elliott's 
version of the Sunday speech will be an extraordinary help to a victory 
on the hill next week. I do not believe Tony's version will help us 
achieve this end. It may help the conservative cause in the 88 elections 
but it won't help prevent the introduction of U.S. forces in 1990 after 
everything has been lost in CentAm. Wd you pls look at both versions. I 
will go to work hard on whichever approach you direct, but wd vy much 
appreciate yr. views. Warm regards, North

NOTE FROM: OLIVER NORTH
Subject: PRIVATE BLANK CHECK
Follow up to yr last re the speech: Talked w/ Pat. He seems adamant. He 
has made some mods to the Dolan draft but insists we need a "highly 
emotional" presentation that indicts the Libs/Dems. Am more concerned 
than ever that we are headed down the wrong path with victory well within 
our grasp. Privately Pat is portraying the Skelton approach as 
capitulation. Well recognizing the practical limits of both power and 
time, I believe that if you can you should ask DTR not to send the Dolan 
draft to RR tomorrow as planned. Salient points: -- the two speeches are 
entirely different approaches; Elliott's lays out a structured 
presentation of the FACTS and the strategic threat as the Pres requested 
last Weds. Dolan's is a highly charged emotional appeal. -- If both 
speeches are to go forward, they must be read separately in their 
entirity. They are both so structurally different that I cannot find a 
way to stuff facts from Ben's into Tony's. -- Ben's version really does 
put the greatest pressure on the Congress without being inflammatory. 
We've gotten good milage out of the Buchanan piece on who supports 
America vs. who supports commies. The President is, and must stay above 
that.

-- Finally, in the for what it's worth dept - Kissinger stopped by for a 
chat this afternoon. I took the liberty of asking for his thoughts. In 
the four years I've known him I never heard him say "good" until today. 
His comment (after making some useful improvements - which we have 
incorporated) was "this is very good -it is just the right approach." 
Pls, if possible, talk to DTR before he sends the Dolan version fwd 
tomorrow. If you think it wd help, I wd be willing to talk to him. Wm 
regards, North

NOTE FROM: Lynn S. Sachs
SUBJECT: Barnes trip to the Contadora Meetings
Barnes is planning to go to the Contadora Meetings this weekend.  It is 
now apparent that he may be talking with other members about joining him 
-- Slattery, Richardson, Jeffords and Ridge.  Talked to Will Ball about 
this and White House Legislative Affairs have talked to a number of our 
Republican friends.  While it is clear that we will undoubtedly not be 
able to turn the trip off we do want to be on the record that we think 
Congressional participation/ observation is inappropriate!  State has 
suggested that the President write to the Speaker asking him to "rein 
Barnes in".  Will agrees that Presidential involvement is not necessary 
and recommend someone at State (Abrams) call Barnes to express our 
concerns.  If Barnes is still determined to make the trip the Shultz will 
contact either the Speaker or Fascell to get on the record that the trip 
is a bad idea.  Politically we think Barnes may get so far out on a limb 
on this that his colleagues (Democrats and Republicans) will think that 
he has mingled where he does not belong.  From a substantive point of 
view, though Barnes' presence could cause problems.

SUBJECT: Humphrey Meeting
Flo, pls print out following for the Admiral before his 2:00 p.m. meeting 
with Senator Humphrey and the President:
         
During Senator Humphrey's scheduled meeting with the President and you 
this afternoon, he intends to raise the following Afghan related issues:
--The Geneva proximity talks.  Humphrey is concerned about instrument 4 
and possibility Paks will agree to Sov withdrawal schedule which will 
mandate immediate cutoff of our supply to Resistance, leaving Sovs free 
to find a pretext to stall their withdrawal.  (Some of us on the staff 
are also concerned).
--He will raise Pak refusal to facilitate movement of Soviet POW's being 
held by the Resistance.  Suggest you respond we are working this closely 
to facilitate movement of SOV asylum requesters to the U.S., but problem 
has been determining eligibility- some are drug addicts- as well as Pak 
concern about public disclosures of their role in working with the 
Resistance and the U.S.  It is high on our agenda, however.
--Humphrey will ask the President to break relations with the Afghan 
government and pull out our embassy. [Four lines deleted, (b)(1)(TS/CW) 
exemption]
--Humphrey will also recommend the President name one high level 
coordinator to be the "Afghan Czar" for the U.S. govt.  The Senator has 
long felt a senior White House appointment is necessary to pull the 
entire U.S. govt along in tandem in order to reach our policy objectives.
These T.P.s have been coordinated with Ron Sable.

NOTE FROM: JAMES R. STARK
SUBJECT: "Concessions" on Saudi arms
Rod mentioned that you were not optimistic on the Saudis accepting the 
conditions Congress might require on some Presidential certification on 
Saudi arms.  For the past several weeks, Sen Warner bas been circulating 
a possible proposal which would have the President certify that the 
Saudis promise to use the missiles for defensive purposes only and not to 
transfer them to third parties without our permission.  (There may be 
other conditions, but these are the most important).  If Congress were to 
make such a proposal, our job would be much simpler, since the Saudis 
have to agree to precisely these conditions every LOA they sign for the 
weapons.  This makes a great figleaf for those Senators looking for an 
acceptable cover to change their vote.
  We have to be careful not to let Congress overstep itself on this.  If 
conditions linking the sale to progress in the Arab- Israeli peace 
process were inserted (such as direct negotiations), the Saudis would 
back out.
   Our problem is that, in spite of Warner's efforts, the response has 
been underwhelming.  But it remains a good idea if we can exercise some 
indirect control over the wording of the certification requirement.

just returned from 1 hr mtg. w/ McCurdy. Bottom line: All items 
negotiable except absolute minimum on aid to CentAm Democracies will 
probably work out to abt. 300M - well down from his earlier $500M. He 
agrees keeping NHAC will not work and is willing to give on issues such 
as timimg of weaps deliveries, etc. Basically he just wants someone to 
pay attention to him. He wants to keep role as "broker" btwn 
conservatives/ liberals and Dems/Reps. At bottom is ego. It might be 
worth it to have me tell him that a mtg w/ you might be possible if he 
becomes more reasonable on things such as second votes, etc. pls protect

IS HOW FAR THE PROCESS HAS MOVED---CIA INVOLVEMENT WAS ONLY MENTIONED IN

NOTE FROM: BOB PEARSON
SUBJECT: ODSM and DOM highlights

Jim Miller - GRH decision expected today, said Gramm had a fix (to make 
Comptroller General subject to Presidential dismissal for cause). 
Wallison said it would not work - Justice felt was insufficient. 
Miller/Wallison to further coordinate.

 - DTR asked Miller to coordinate with you on issue how to deal with Cap 
in controlling 86 outlays. Jim had said 86 outlays ahead of 85 and should 
simpl y admit this would be case for DOD for both 86 and 87. Discussion 
aros e because latest monthly deficit figure ($39 Bil) is ahead of last 
year, due, Miller said to increased farm and DOD outlays and lowered 
receipts.

Much interest in President's remarks at 7/3 - 4 ceremonies - DTR wants 
them "memorable." (They aren't to that point yet.)

ODSM: Ed covered NYT/WP stories on US South Africa policy, noted we had 
guidance in place. Recommendation was for no comment on the Les Gelb 
story on INF offer in Gorbachev letter since it was so wide of the mark.

KS referenced story from S.B. about possible private funding for 4th 
orbiter. (This was raised as DOM as "nothing new" - DTR agreed.)

TC asked about exchange of messages with Shultz over attendance at 
Waldheim inagural & told him GPS reply in and forwarded to you. Lavin 
told him DTR did not oppose invitation to Vranitsky in 87 (confirmed this 
with Dawson who said DTR? would have recommendation for timing with NSC).

DTR reported Soviets "did everything possible" to give positive tone to 
US/USSR discussions in Stockholm on Middle East, e.g., followed US 
suggested agenda, were not contentious. Believed attitude due to possible 
Summit more than a new approach to M.E., though Sovs showed some 
indication of flexibility. Re[?]port to follow.

Don Gregg reported good trip to ME to prepare for VP trip 7/26 - 8/4. 
Israeli [?]tra-religious/secular dispute serious: [Deleted, (b)(1)(s) 
exemption] Egypt - needs ambo, affairs drifting, Sofaer back for further 
talks. Egyptians believe he too pro-Israeli position.

[word illegible] referred to EPC today on textiles and textile 
negotiations. Plan is to get Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea to hold exports 
to US to no growth - HK and Taiwan on board, have to work on Koreans. 
Said US/EC tariff dispute resulting from EC enlargement still likely to 
be resolved - Alan Woods back today from meeting over weekend in Europe - 
anything new will report.

NOTE: Don Jones called yesterday, saying that Casey told Weinberger that 
Nitze had a copy of the proposal. Told him there had been no 
distribution, and per [word illegible] conversation/PROFS with you 
Saturday, that you would talk with Cap before normal distribution made.

<H3>White House E-mail  CHRONOLOGY</H3>
<B>1982</B> - The National Security Council (NSC) staff at the White House acquires a prototype electronic mail system, from IBM, called the Professional Office
System (PROFs).
<P>
<B>April 1985 </B>- The PROFs e-mail system becomes fully operational within the NSC,
including not only the full staff, but also home terminals for the National
Security Adviser, Robert "Bud" McFarlane, and his deputy, Admiral John M.
Poindexter.
<P>
<B>November 1986</B> - The remainder of the White House comes on line with
electronic mail, at first with the PROFs system, and later (by the end of the 1980s) through a variety of systems including VAX A-1 ("All in One"), and ccmail.
<P>
<B>November 22-25, 1986</B> - John Poindexter and Oliver North electronically shred
more than 5000 e-mail notes in the memory banks of their computer systems, as the
Iran-contra scandal breaks.
<P>
<B>November 28, 1986</B> - Career staff at the White House Communications Agency
order the November backup tapes of the e-mail system to be saved instead of recycled as usual. Subsequently, investigators from the FBI and the Tower Commission use
the backup takes to reconstruct the Iran-contra scandal.
<P>
 - The Tower Commission issues its report on Iran-contra,
reprinting hundreds of PROFs notes exchanged by McFarlane, Poindexter and
North.
<P>
<B>January 19, 1989</B> - On the last day of the Reagan presidency, the National
Security Archive files a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests
together with a lawsuit against President Ronald Reagan, to prevent the imminent
erasure of the White House electronic mail backup tapes. At 6:10 pm, on the eve
of George Bush's inauguration, U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker issues a
Temporary Restraining Order, prohibiting the destruction of the backup tapes to
the PROFs system.
<P>
<B>September 15, 1989</B> - U.S. District Judge Charles B. Richey rules that the
National Security Archive and its co-plaintiffs, including the American
Historical Association (AHA) and the American Library Association (ALA), have
standing to sue President Bush, in order to force him to comply with the
retention requirements of various records acts which potentially cover the White
House e-mail.
<P>
<B>January 25, 1991</B> - After a year-and-a-half of legal procedural wrangling, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upholds Judge Richey's
ruling on standing, denying the Bush administration's attempts to have the case
dismissed.
<P>
<B>November 20, 1992</B> - On request from the plaintiffs, Judge Richey adds the White House e-mail from the lame-duck Bush administration to the case, issuing a
restraining order preventing the Bush White House from destroying its own
backup computer records.
<P>
<B>January 6, 1993</B> - Judge Richey rules that computer tapes containing copies of
e-mail messages by Reagan and Bush White House staff must be preserved like
other government records, because the electronic versions are not simply duplicates of
paper printouts, but contain additional information beyond the paper copies.
<P>
<B>January 11 and 14, 1993</B> - Judge Richey issues specific court orders requiring
that the Bush White House preserve its computer records. In press interviews,
Judge Richey says that despite his orders, he believes that the Bush
administration is planning to destroy its e-mail files.
<P>
<B>January 15, 1993</B> - In an expedited emergency ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit upholds and modifies the rulings by Judge
Richey, holding that government officials could erase White House and NSC
computer files, as long as they preserved, on backup tapes, identical copies of
what was being erased.
<P>
<B>January 19, 1993</B> - President Bush signs a secret agreement with Don Wilson,
head of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), purporting to
grant Bush exclusive legal control over the e-mail tapes of his administration. 
Working through the night, a staff team from NARA takes custody of thousands
of tapes and disk drives, hurriedly removing them from White House offices to
prevent incoming Clinton appointees from gaining access to them.
<P>
<B>February 16, 1993</B> - NARA career staff who managed the transfer describe in an internal memo how the so-called "midnight ride" had violated NARA's own rules
for records transfers and how several sets of tapes ordered preserved by Judge Richey
had been lost, erased or damaged.
<P>
<B>May 22, 1993 </B>- Judge Richey cites the Clinton White House and the acting
Archivist of the United States for contempt of court for failing to carry out his
order to issue new and appropriate guidelines for the preservation of the
computer records of the Reagan, Bush and Clinton White House staff.
<P>
<B>August 13, 1993</B> - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
vacates Judge Richey's contempt orders but upholds his overall decision that the
Federal Records Act (FRA) requires that complete electronic copies of e-mail
messages be preserved by the White House, and by extension, government
agencies in general. The appeals court remands the case to Judge Richey to decide the
issue of the dividing line between "agency" records covered by the FRA and
presidential records covered by the Presidential Records Act.
<P>
<B>March 25, 1994</B> - In a brief filed in federal court, the Clinton administration
declares that the National Security Council is not an agency, and should be
accorded the protection from public scrutiny given to the President's personal
advisers. This argument attempts to remove the Clinton administration's White
House e-mail from the reach of FOIA requests and the FRA, arguing that all its
documents are subject only to the Presidential Records Act (PRA) and therefore
not to court oversight.
<P>
<B>December 13, 1994</B> - The e-mail plaintiffs file suit against the Acting Archivist
of the United States to void the Bush-Wilson agreement, in American Historical
Association et. al. v. Peterson.
<P>
<B>February 15, 1995</B> - Judge Richey rejects the Clinton administration's arguments about the NSC's status as "arbitrary and capricious... contrary to history, past practice and the law," and declares that the National Security Council is an
agency. The government subsequently appeals the decision, and the plaintiffs
cross-appeal against a portion of Richey's ruling that opens a loophole for
senior NSC staff giving advice to the President.
<P>
<B>February 27, 1995</B> - In a separate opinion in the lawsuit over the Bush-Wilson
agreement, Judge Richey declares the agreement "null and void," writing that "No
one, not even a President, is above the law." The New York Times subsequently
editorializes, under the headline "A Special Place in History for Mr. Bush," that
"No President has the right to corner official records in an effort to control
his place in history." (March 1, 1995, page A18)
<P>
<B>September 8, 1995</B> - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit hears oral arguments in the case on the issue of Judge Richey's decision
and the agency versus Presidential status of the NSC.

The New
Press, <b>george jr.</b> is able to bring you, raw and unplugged, 
genuine-article, top-secret
messages - from Blanton's book, White House E-mail - that the Reagan/Bush

House tried to destroy. 

<P>
We'll bring you several of their actual email messages a week, until heck freezes over,  without editorial gloss.
<P>
<A HREF="#techies">Techies</A> will want to know: These messages are scanned ASCII  text files on DOS-formatted disk (edited by Blanton, produced by Ian Stevenson with technical gizmonics from John Martinez).
<P>
In case you've forgotten--here's a <A HREF="#whoswho">who's who</A>, the rogue's gallery from the Reagan-Bush years. And for those, who like us can  barely remember what we had for breakfast, here's a <A HREF="#chronology">chronology</A> of  White House events.

NOTE FROM:OLIVER NORTH
Subject:MIKE LEDEEN
Have told this to Ami[?]. You should be aware, however, that it is my opinion, based on 
my meeting w/ Gorba on Monday night, that Gorba tells Ledeen everything. Ami[?] 
suspects that there is probably a secret business arrangement among Schwimmer, 
Ledeen and Gorba that is being conducted w/o the knowledge of any of the three 
respective governments and that this will result in at least some cross fertilization of 
information. This may not be altogether bad if we can keep in touch w/ Ledeen enough 
to get a feel for what is really going on. I have no problem w/ someone making an 
honest profit on honest business. I do have a problem if it means the compromise of 
sensitive political or operational details. We might consider making Mike a contract 
employee of the CIA and requiring him to take a periodic polygraph. Yes? No?

NOTE FROM:JAMES R. STARK
SUBJECT:Saudi arms
Don raised an important issue yesterday with respect to the number of missiles in the 
Saudi package.  The numbers were based on the long-term assessment of potential 
threats to Saudi Arabia (South Yemen, Iran, and Iraq) which would apply through the 
end of the missile delivery period.  They are based on the standard methodology for 
computing threat-oriented weapons inventory requirements, and were originally much 
larger (based on a combined Iran-Iraq threat).  The current AIM-9 numbers are based 
on the threat from the largest single potential foe--Iraq.
  As a benchmark, you should be aware that we have already sold the Saudis a large 
number of missiles.  The following list shows the total sold and, in parentheses, the 
number remaining to be delivered to complete that total. [Three lines deleted, (b)(1)(c) 
exemption]
  As you can see, there are [Deleted, (b)(1)(c) exemption] Sidewinders still in the 
pipeline awaiting delivery to the Saudis.  Thus, a US move to notify additional missiles 
would have less immediate military value than accelerating deliveries already 
approved.  The Saudi goal is the tangible evidence of US political support and 
commitment for their security represented by a Presidential decision to raise the arms 
issue.

NOTE FROM:OLIVER NORTH
Subject:Anything New??
After the House vote on aid to the resistance, I plan to take a few days just to get re-
acquainted w/ the family. Meanwhile, we are trying to find a way to get 10 BLOWPIPE 
launchers and 20 missiles from [Deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] thru the Short Bros. Rep. 
The V.P. from Short Bros. sought me out several mos. ago and I met w/ him again in 
London a few weeks ago when I was there [Deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] Short Bros., 
the mfgr. of the BLOWPIPE, is willing to arrange the deal, conduct the training and 
even send U.K. "tech reps" fwd if we can close the arrangement. Dick Secord has 
already paid 10% down on the delivery and we have a Salvadoran EUC which is 
acceptable to the [Deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] Unfortunately, the week all this was 
going to closure we decided to go fwd [Deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] The arrangement 
is now on ice and we are casting about for a way to tell the [Deleted, (b)(1)(s) 
exemption] that we wd be pleased if this all went thru. Yr thoughts wd be appreciated.

On our other action, there are fresh developments. Yesterday, [Deleted, (b)(1)(s) 
exemption] called the phone drop that Dick Secord had given him. Al Hakim, who we 
passed off as a"White House interpreter" at the Frankfurt mtg. spoke to [Deleted, 
(b)(1)(s) exemption] twice yesterday. The bottom line of the calls is that [Deleted, 
(b)(1)(s) exemption] wd like to have us meet w/ the Iranian side next week at Kharg 
Island. Supposedly, during the mtg the hostages wd be released and we wd 
immediately start delivering the 3k TOWs and agree at the mtg to the delivery of spare 
parts which they desperately need. They profess to be very concerned about the nature 
of the Soviet threat and want all we can give them on that score. Not sure at this point 
how real this offer is, but he says Rafsanjani wd come as the head of the Iranian side. If 
this looks like a go -- and we should know more tomorrow when the next phone call is 
scheduled--how are you for travel during the week of 31Mar-4Apr?  Warm regards, 
North BT

These excerpts are from a National Security Archive Documents Disk, (C) 1995 The National Security Archive, of 260 substantive White House e-mail messages which could not fit in <i>White House E-mail </i>(New Press, $14.95) for space reasons.

The White House refused to provide any of the e-mail in electronic
form. Rather, White House and other government staff printed out
the specific e-mail messages targetted by the National Security
Archive's Freedom of Information Act requests, then reviewed the
printouts for classified information and privacy issues before
releasing them in hard copy form.
<P>
Ian Stevenson then employed a Hewlett Packard ScanJet IIc/ADF
scanner, together with CAERE optical character recognition
software, to digitize the large stack of White House printouts
selected for this disk. The typographical errors, run-on
sentences, bad grammar, colloquial language and other questionable
matters found here are all exactly as they appear in the originals
-- nothing was corrected or bowdlerized for this disk. The layouts
are as close to the originals as humanly possible, including the
classification markings.

<H3>White House E-mail  CHRONOLOGY</H3>
<B>1982</B> - The National Security Council (NSC) staff at the White House acquires a prototype electronic mail system, from IBM, called the Professional Office
System (PROFs).
<P>
<B>April 1985 </B>- The PROFs e-mail system becomes fully operational within the NSC,
including not only the full staff, but also home terminals for the National
Security Adviser, Robert "Bud" McFarlane, and his deputy, Admiral John M.
Poindexter.
<P>
<B>November 1986</B> - The remainder of the White House comes on line with
electronic mail, at first with the PROFs system, and later (by the end of the 1980s) through a variety of systems including VAX A-1 ("All in One"), and ccmail.
<P>
<B>November 22-25, 1986</B> - John Poindexter and Oliver North electronically shred
more than 5000 e-mail notes in the memory banks of their computer systems, as the
Iran-contra scandal breaks.
<P>
<B>November 28, 1986</B> - Career staff at the White House Communications Agency
order the November backup tapes of the e-mail system to be saved instead of recycled as usual. Subsequently, investigators from the FBI and the Tower Commission use
the backup takes to reconstruct the Iran-contra scandal.
<P>
 - The Tower Commission issues its report on Iran-contra,
reprinting hundreds of PROFs notes exchanged by McFarlane, Poindexter and
North.
<P>
<B>January 19, 1989</B> - On the last day of the Reagan presidency, the National
Security Archive files a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests
together with a lawsuit against President Ronald Reagan, to prevent the imminent
erasure of the White House electronic mail backup tapes. At 6:10 pm, on the eve
of George Bush's inauguration, U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker issues a
Temporary Restraining Order, prohibiting the destruction of the backup tapes to
the PROFs system.
<P>
<B>September 15, 1989</B> - U.S. District Judge Charles B. Richey rules that the
National Security Archive and its co-plaintiffs, including the American
Historical Association (AHA) and the American Library Association (ALA), have
standing to sue President Bush, in order to force him to comply with the
retention requirements of various records acts which potentially cover the White
House e-mail.
<P>
<B>January 25, 1991</B> - After a year-and-a-half of legal procedural wrangling, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upholds Judge Richey's
ruling on standing, denying the Bush administration's attempts to have the case
dismissed.
<P>
<B>November 20, 1992</B> - On request from the plaintiffs, Judge Richey adds the White House e-mail from the lame-duck Bush administration to the case, issuing a
restraining order preventing the Bush White House from destroying its own
backup computer records.
<P>
<B>January 6, 1993</B> - Judge Richey rules that computer tapes containing copies of
e-mail messages by Reagan and Bush White House staff must be preserved like
other government records, because the electronic versions are not simply duplicates of
paper printouts, but contain additional information beyond the paper copies.
<P>
<B>January 11 and 14, 1993</B> - Judge Richey issues specific court orders requiring
that the Bush White House preserve its computer records. In press interviews,
Judge Richey says that despite his orders, he believes that the Bush
administration is planning to destroy its e-mail files.
<P>
<B>January 15, 1993</B> - In an expedited emergency ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit upholds and modifies the rulings by Judge
Richey, holding that government officials could erase White House and NSC
computer files, as long as they preserved, on backup tapes, identical copies of
what was being erased.
<P>
<B>January 19, 1993</B> - President Bush signs a secret agreement with Don Wilson,
head of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), purporting to
grant Bush exclusive legal control over the e-mail tapes of his administration. 
Working through the night, a staff team from NARA takes custody of thousands
of tapes and disk drives, hurriedly removing them from White House offices to
prevent incoming Clinton appointees from gaining access to them.
<P>
<B>February 16, 1993</B> - NARA career staff who managed the transfer describe in an internal memo how the so-called "midnight ride" had violated NARA's own rules
for records transfers and how several sets of tapes ordered preserved by Judge Richey
had been lost, erased or damaged.
<P>
<B>May 22, 1993 </B>- Judge Richey cites the Clinton White House and the acting
Archivist of the United States for contempt of court for failing to carry out his
order to issue new and appropriate guidelines for the preservation of the
computer records of the Reagan, Bush and Clinton White House staff.
<P>
<B>August 13, 1993</B> - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
vacates Judge Richey's contempt orders but upholds his overall decision that the
Federal Records Act (FRA) requires that complete electronic copies of e-mail
messages be preserved by the White House, and by extension, government
agencies in general. The appeals court remands the case to Judge Richey to decide the
issue of the dividing line between "agency" records covered by the FRA and
presidential records covered by the Presidential Records Act.
<P>
<B>March 25, 1994</B> - In a brief filed in federal court, the Clinton administration
declares that the National Security Council is not an agency, and should be
accorded the protection from public scrutiny given to the President's personal
advisers. This argument attempts to remove the Clinton administration's White
House e-mail from the reach of FOIA requests and the FRA, arguing that all its
documents are subject only to the Presidential Records Act (PRA) and therefore
not to court oversight.
<P>
<B>December 13, 1994</B> - The e-mail plaintiffs file suit against the Acting Archivist
of the United States to void the Bush-Wilson agreement, in American Historical
Association et. al. v. Peterson.
<P>
<B>February 15, 1995</B> - Judge Richey rejects the Clinton administration's arguments about the NSC's status as "arbitrary and capricious... contrary to history, past practice and the law," and declares that the National Security Council is an
agency. The government subsequently appeals the decision, and the plaintiffs
cross-appeal against a portion of Richey's ruling that opens a loophole for
senior NSC staff giving advice to the President.
<P>
<B>February 27, 1995</B> - In a separate opinion in the lawsuit over the Bush-Wilson
agreement, Judge Richey declares the agreement "null and void," writing that "No
one, not even a President, is above the law." The New York Times subsequently
editorializes, under the headline "A Special Place in History for Mr. Bush," that
"No President has the right to corner official records in an effort to control
his place in history." (March 1, 1995, page A18)
<P>
<B>September 8, 1995</B> - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit hears oral arguments in the case on the issue of Judge Richey's decision
and the agency versus Presidential status of the NSC.

NOTE FROM:OLIVER NORTH
Subject:Anything New??
After the House vote on aid to the resistance, I plan to take a few days 
just to get re-acquainted w/ the family. Meanwhile, we are trying to find 
a way to get 10 BLOWPIPE launchers and 20 missiles from [Deleted, 
(b)(1)(s) exemption] thru the Short Bros. Rep. The V.P. from Short Bros. 
sought me out several mos. ago and I met w/ him again in London a few 
weeks ago when I was there [Deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] Short Bros., 
the mfgr. of the BLOWPIPE, is willing to arrange the deal, conduct the 
training and even send U.K. "tech reps" fwd if we can close the 
arrangement. Dick Secord has already paid 10% down on the delivery and we 
have a Salvadoran EUC which is acceptable to the [Deleted, (b)(1)(s) 
exemption] Unfortunately, the week all this was going to closure we 
decided to go fwd [Deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] The arrangement is now 
on ice and we are casting about for a way to tell the [Deleted, (b)(1)(s) 
exemption] that we wd be pleased if this all went thru. Yr thoughts wd be 
appreciated.

On our other action, there are fresh developments. Yesterday, [Deleted, 
(b)(1)(s) exemption] called the phone drop that Dick Secord had given 
him. Al Hakim, who we passed off as a"White House interpreter" at the 
Frankfurt mtg. spoke to [Deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] twice yesterday. 
The bottom line of the calls is that [Deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] wd 
like to have us meet w/ the Iranian side next week at Kharg Island. 
Supposedly, during the mtg the hostages wd be released and we wd 
immediately start delivering the 3k TOWs and agree at the mtg to the 
delivery of spare parts which they desperately need. They profess to be 
very concerned about the nature of the Soviet threat and want all we can 
give them on that score. Not sure at this point how real this offer is, 
but he says Rafsanjani wd come as the head of the Iranian side. If this 
looks like a go -- and we should know more tomorrow when the next phone 
call is scheduled--how are you for travel during the week of 31Mar-4Apr?  
Warm regards, North BT

NOTE FROM:Peter Rodman
SUBJECT:Saudi Arms
  A friend of mine on the West Coast who is well plugged in to the Jewish 
community leadership called me to offer his ideas/help on the Saudi 
package. (He's a strong Reagan supporter and has heard many lectures from 
me on the importance of our military relations with Arabs.)  
  The idea he was suggesting was that we offer Israel some new goody as 
part of a "package deal" -- he's convinced this would give both Jewish 
leaders and pro-Israel Senators a way out. First he suggested forgiveness 
of FMS debt, which I explained was a non-starter for budgetary 
reasons.Then he expressed interest in the various things Rabin had come 
over to argue for, which were all artfully designed not to have budgetary 
consequences.
  I have no idea whether these things are do-able. But this guy is 
convinced that linking the Saudi package with something for Israel would 
change a lot of votes, and he is in a position to know whereof he speaks.
  Where does DoD stand on the various things Rabin was asking about? Has 
anyone thought about these two issues in tandem?

NOTE FROM:Peter Rodman
SUBJECT:Saudi Arms
  My earlier note, passing on a suggestion about sweetening the pot with 
something for Israel, OBE. But save it for future reference:Many times in 
the past, things unpalatable to the pro-Israel crowd -- whether arms 
deals with Arabs or even argreements involving withdrawals from territory 
-- have been made more palatable by adding something to their side of the 
ledger (instead of subtracting from the other side). Any future 
breakthrough in the peace process will probably also find us looking for 
ways to buy them off the same way.

NOTE FROM:OLIVER NORTH
Subject:Iran
Have just returned from mtg w/ Rabin, who called at 1910 and asked me to 
come by his hotel. Mtg lasted abt 1.5hrs. Summary:Vy complementary to you 
& noted that the hostage operation had to be the longest running no-leak 
operation of its kind in history. Said he was vy pleased w/ yr reaction & 
SecShultz re Kfir to Honduras.  He finally got to the point of inviting 
me over. He noted press stories and other intel on lack of supplies for 
Contras and wanted to know if we had any need for SovBloc weaps and ammo 
he could make avail. I told him that we wd vy much like to have whatever 
he cd spare and he asked "has your shipload left the Med yet?" (This is 
the one I tried to get Casey's people to pay for as a means of covering 
some of Dick's debts). At this point I cd see no reason to dissemble, and 
told him it was in Lisbon. He then suggested that if it is "your ship, 
not the CIA's," it shd come to Haifa and he wd have it filled w/ whatever 
they cd have assembled in the next five days. He went on at some length 
about his low opinion of our intel service - both in terms of covert ops 
and intelligence collecting (I noted that maybe we were getting better at 
counterintelligence than they thought - and he allowed that was probably 
true and that there would "be no more Pollards).  Bottom line:Don't quite 
no what to do.  Did not want to turn down offer - since it includes 
recently seized PLO shipment captured at sea. We can go ahead and move 
the whole shipment to Honduras or El Salvador - but still won't have any 
money to pay off rapidly growing debts. Hate to turn away offers like 
this - it will really help in the long run. Any advice? V/R North P.S. 
pls look at today's [Deleted, (b)(1)(c) exemption] re Contra resupply 
effort. All flights being flown - including three msns last night and 
three more tonight at last light have been vy successful. All being done 
by Dick's pilots w/ borrowed $.

SUBJECT:Persian Gulf
A couple of news items:
 --Bandar is reportedly returning to Washington tomorrow.
 --The GCC had a team in the US last month looking at the Lockheed P-3 as 
a possible surveillance aircraft.  In general, we want to support GCC 
multilateral defense efforts.  Unfortunately, this mission did not go 
well (ISA didn't get apprised of it til the eleventh hour and neither 
Navy nor Lockheed went to much trouble to make it a success).  GCC has 
now reportedly narrowed its search to Dutch or French alternatives.  The 
real issue is need for a PD making GCC eligible to purchase defense goods 
and services, which we don't yet have.  DOD is ready to go but has been 
holding up the paperwork due to their understanding that GCC wants to 
downplay public association with the US.  (Since the PD has to be 
notified to Congress, USG to GCC arms sales would inevitably become 
public).  We ought to be going ahead with the PD, but want to check with 
the GCC first.  GCC Secretary General Bishara is in town next week and 
should pay a call on Armitage, who can be expected to raise the issue 
with him.

NOTE FROM:Howard Teicher
Subject:a-4s for argentina
during the u.s.-u.k. pol-mil talks last week, the brits raised on their 
own initiative u.k. opposition to the transfer or sale of a-4s to 
argentina. [Five lines deleted, (b)(1)(s) exemption] the meaning of this 
is clear:thatcher is worried about the electoral reprecussions of what 
labor will describe as the u.s. payback for her cooperation.
             
notwithstanding her political problem, which u.k. experts continue to 
credit to economic problems, non-anglophiles in the u.s.g. (i.e. ara 
types, pm types and soviet types) remain convinced that we must find ways 
to strengthen argentina's military and support alfonsin. everyone who 
supports this approach believes the president should discuss the problem 
with{thatcher next month. i would propose the following sequence of 
actions in advance of such a dialogue
  - you and shultz discuss at the end of this week;
  - assuming he agrees it should be put to the president, discuss with 
the president or send decision memo next week;
  - if he agrees to raise it with thatcher, you and shultz could send a 
substantive message to your counterparts advising them      of the 
importance the president attaches to this issue and his intention to 
raise it when he meets with mrs. thatcher; 
  - the bureaucracy will meanwhile develop a game plan for a-4         
modernization and diplomatic initiatives (perhaps to include a u. s. 
commitment to work with alfonsin to bring about an end to hostilities and 
further progress in the political area.
  - thatcher might still say no, forcing the president to decide whether 
to acquiesce or take the measures which most objective observers feel 
best serves our hemispheric interests.

NOTE FROM:Peter Rodman
SUBJECT:European Arms Sales to Iran
  I note in the Sit Room's evening summary the other day a report that 
Genscher is emphasizing that the FRG will not ship arms to either side in 
the Iran-Iraq war.
  I have been worried that the disclosures of our limited arms transfers 
might provide an excuse for several other countries to throw off all 
restraints in permitting such sales (citing US "hypocrisy," etc.) 
However, maybe the uproar will turn out to encourage other governments to 
crack down harder, for fear of inviting similar "scandals" there.  I can 
see the brouhaha in Italy having the same result, for example.
  So -- at least in that respect -- we may not turn out so badly.

NOTE FROM:Howard Teicher
Subj ect:A 4s
i agree with your analysis. the israelis will not quickly find a   way to 
reimburse the argentines, and may even try to force us to eat the costs 
by involving the congress. i continue to believe that we must find ways 
to strengthen argentine democracy with arms transfers, perhaps through 
agreement for a long-term co-production arrangement that would give the 
argentines confidence in our support. but don't look to the israelis for 
relief on this one, especially when we're pushing to kill the lavi.

NOTE FROM:Peter Rodman
SUBJECT:Operation Staunch
  Even if we have trouble putting Operation Staunch back together, we can 
at least blow the whistle on the countries that are sending arms 
clandestinely to Iran.
  I note in this morning's INR summary a major new Bulgarian arms 
shipment. (These are John Whitehead's new friends!)
  We should let the Iraqis know of such information when it turns up. 
Perhaps we are already doing so, but in the present environment we should 
make a point of telling the Iraqis what we know.

These excerpts are from a National Security Archive Documents Disk, (C) 1995 The National Security Archive, of 260 substantive White House e-mail messages which could not fit in <i>White House E-mail </i>(New Press, $14.95) for space reasons.

<H3>Techies/White House E-mail link</H3>

The White House refused to provide any of the e-mail in electronic
form. Rather, White House and other government staff printed out
the specific e-mail messages targetted by the National Security
Archive's Freedom of Information Act requests, then reviewed the
printouts for classified information and privacy issues before
releasing them in hard copy form.
<P>
Ian Stevenson then employed a Hewlett Packard ScanJet IIc/ADF
scanner, together with CAERE optical character recognition
software, to digitize the large stack of White House printouts
selected for this disk. The typographical errors, run-on
sentences, bad grammar, colloquial language and other questionable
matters found here are all exactly as they appear in the originals
-- nothing was corrected or bowdlerized for this disk. The layouts
are as close to the originals as humanly possible, including the
classification markings.

<H3>White House E-mail  CHRONOLOGY</H3>
<B>1982</B> - The National Security Council (NSC) staff at the White House acquires a prototype electronic mail system, from IBM, called the Professional Office
System (PROFs).
<P>
<B>April 1985 </B>- The PROFs e-mail system becomes fully operational within the NSC,
including not only the full staff, but also home terminals for the National
Security Adviser, Robert "Bud" McFarlane, and his deputy, Admiral John M.
Poindexter.
<P>
<B>November 1986</B> - The remainder of the White House comes on line with
electronic mail, at first with the PROFs system, and later (by the end of the 1980s) through a variety of systems including VAX A-1 ("All in One"), and ccmail.
<P>
<B>November 22-25, 1986</B> - John Poindexter and Oliver North electronically shred
more than 5000 e-mail notes in the memory banks of their computer systems, as the
Iran-contra scandal breaks.
<P>
<B>November 28, 1986</B> - Career staff at the White House Communications Agency
order the November backup tapes of the e-mail system to be saved instead of recycled as usual. Subsequently, investigators from the FBI and the Tower Commission use
the backup takes to reconstruct the Iran-contra scandal.
<P>
 - The Tower Commission issues its report on Iran-contra,
reprinting hundreds of PROFs notes exchanged by McFarlane, Poindexter and
North.
<P>
<B>January 19, 1989</B> - On the last day of the Reagan presidency, the National
Security Archive files a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests
together with a lawsuit against President Ronald Reagan, to prevent the imminent
erasure of the White House electronic mail backup tapes. At 6:10 pm, on the eve
of George Bush's inauguration, U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker issues a
Temporary Restraining Order, prohibiting the destruction of the backup tapes to
the PROFs system.
<P>
<B>September 15, 1989</B> - U.S. District Judge Charles B. Richey rules that the
National Security Archive and its co-plaintiffs, including the American
Historical Association (AHA) and the American Library Association (ALA), have
standing to sue President Bush, in order to force him to comply with the
retention requirements of various records acts which potentially cover the White
House e-mail.
<P>
<B>January 25, 1991</B> - After a year-and-a-half of legal procedural wrangling, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upholds Judge Richey's
ruling on standing, denying the Bush administration's attempts to have the case
dismissed.
<P>
<B>November 20, 1992</B> - On request from the plaintiffs, Judge Richey adds the White House e-mail from the lame-duck Bush administration to the case, issuing a
restraining order preventing the Bush White House from destroying its own
backup computer records.
<P>
<B>January 6, 1993</B> - Judge Richey rules that computer tapes containing copies of
e-mail messages by Reagan and Bush White House staff must be preserved like
other government records, because the electronic versions are not simply duplicates of
paper printouts, but contain additional information beyond the paper copies.
<P>
<B>January 11 and 14, 1993</B> - Judge Richey issues specific court orders requiring
that the Bush White House preserve its computer records. In press interviews,
Judge Richey says that despite his orders, he believes that the Bush
administration is planning to destroy its e-mail files.
<P>
<B>January 15, 1993</B> - In an expedited emergency ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit upholds and modifies the rulings by Judge
Richey, holding that government officials could erase White House and NSC
computer files, as long as they preserved, on backup tapes, identical copies of
what was being erased.
<P>
<B>January 19, 1993</B> - President Bush signs a secret agreement with Don Wilson,
head of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), purporting to
grant Bush exclusive legal control over the e-mail tapes of his administration. 
Working through the night, a staff team from NARA takes custody of thousands
of tapes and disk drives, hurriedly removing them from White House offices to
prevent incoming Clinton appointees from gaining access to them.
<P>
<B>February 16, 1993</B> - NARA career staff who managed the transfer describe in an internal memo how the so-called "midnight ride" had violated NARA's own rules
for records transfers and how several sets of tapes ordered preserved by Judge Richey
had been lost, erased or damaged.
<P>
<B>May 22, 1993 </B>- Judge Richey cites the Clinton White House and the acting
Archivist of the United States for contempt of court for failing to carry out his
order to issue new and appropriate guidelines for the preservation of the
computer records of the Reagan, Bush and Clinton White House staff.
<P>
<B>August 13, 1993</B> - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
vacates Judge Richey's contempt orders but upholds his overall decision that the
Federal Records Act (FRA) requires that complete electronic copies of e-mail
messages be preserved by the White House, and by extension, government
agencies in general. The appeals court remands the case to Judge Richey to decide the
issue of the dividing line between "agency" records covered by the FRA and
presidential records covered by the Presidential Records Act.
<P>
<B>March 25, 1994</B> - In a brief filed in federal court, the Clinton administration
declares that the National Security Council is not an agency, and should be
accorded the protection from public scrutiny given to the President's personal
advisers. This argument attempts to remove the Clinton administration's White
House e-mail from the reach of FOIA requests and the FRA, arguing that all its
documents are subject only to the Presidential Records Act (PRA) and therefore
not to court oversight.
<P>
<B>December 13, 1994</B> - The e-mail plaintiffs file suit against the Acting Archivist
of the United States to void the Bush-Wilson agreement, in American Historical
Association et. al. v. Peterson.
<P>
<B>February 15, 1995</B> - Judge Richey rejects the Clinton administration's arguments about the NSC's status as "arbitrary and capricious... contrary to history, past practice and the law," and declares that the National Security Council is an
agency. The government subsequently appeals the decision, and the plaintiffs
cross-appeal against a portion of Richey's ruling that opens a loophole for
senior NSC staff giving advice to the President.
<P>
<B>February 27, 1995</B> - In a separate opinion in the lawsuit over the Bush-Wilson
agreement, Judge Richey declares the agreement "null and void," writing that "No
one, not even a President, is above the law." The New York Times subsequently
editorializes, under the headline "A Special Place in History for Mr. Bush," that
"No President has the right to corner official records in an effort to control
his place in history." (March 1, 1995, page A18)
<P>
<B>September 8, 1995</B> - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit hears oral arguments in the case on the issue of Judge Richey's decision
and the agency versus Presidential status of the NSC.

<BR><CENTER>
one evening after a dharma talk
at the Wichita zen center
<BR>
<BR>

Candidate Dole asks Zen Master Roko-shi<br>
"What is my true nature?"
<p>
Roko-shi holds up a hungry child<br>
asks, "What is this?"
<p>
Bob Dole answers<br>
"The failure of the welfare state?"
<p>
Roko-shi hits Dole with a zen stick<br>
"You are too attached to words."
<p>
Roko-shi then holds up a homeless woman<br>
asks, "What is this?"
<p>
Bob Dole answers<br>
"Nothing at all?"
<p>
Roko-shi hits Dole twice more<br>
"You are too attached to emptiness."
<p>
Bob Dole frowns<br>
He does not like Zen
<p>
Roko-shi lifts his zen stick higher<br>
"I will now explain karma."
<p>
Roko-shi weeps asses and elephants<br>
and hits Bob Dole thirty times
<p>
In this way, the struggling candidate<br>
is enlightened

<H2>Ask Kitty</H2>
<br>
  Cats are the most curious of sentient beings, who mostly care not a whit what we might think of them. Hence, they make the most excellent of advisors, even when answering our most dire of questions - as dear Kitty oddly does this time around - with seemingly oblique answers. Have a question?  (<B>george jr.</B> does, namely: What is she up to?) Ask <!-- MailTo Tag --><A HREF="MAILTO:kitty@georgejr.com">Kitty</A>.

<P></P>

  <I> Woman Thing Music</I> CD is the first on the new Virginia Slims Woman Thing Music label. The CD is a collaboration between Emmy Award-winning daytime television actress  Martha Byrne and producer and musician Nile Rodgers.
  

<P> </P>

  The CD  will coincide with the ten-city tour in the spring of 1997.  Martha Byrne will be the headline performer in each of the tour markets including Dallas, New Orleans, Baltimore, Birmingham, New York, Atlanta, Detroit, Charlotte, Chicago and  St. Louis.
   

<P></P>

  The format of the program will afford local  bands with the opportunity to highlight their musical talent and create more visibility for themselves in their respective markets. Bands that are  led  by females or have female members, 21 years old or over, will perform at  popular clubs in their communities and will compete to become the opening act for Martha Byrne when she performs in that market.
   

<P></P>

  Rodgers' old band, Chic, sold more than 10 million units. Chic's recording of<I> Le Freak </I>still  holds  the record for the largest selling single in the history of Warner  Communications. Nile continues to produce new and exciting work. Career successes include Nile's work With Diana Ross, David Bowie and Jeff Beck.

 <I>  Independence Day</I>, the $286- million-plus box-office champion and fastest grossing movie of all time, is set to attack more than 100,000 retail outlets on video across North  America
November 22.  
   

<P></P>

The highly anticipated  video  release of the year's biggest and most popular film will be made available to  the largest consumer video purchasing base ever at ownable  price  of $22.98  in the U.S. and $24.98 in Canada. For a limited time  only  and while supplies last, <I>Independence Day</I> will be available with free,  exclusive 3D Live Action Art, the most spectacular and collectible package and gift  with purchase ever created for a video release.
  

<P> </P>

   Still wowing enthusiastic theater-goers across North America,  <I>Independence Day </I> rewrote the record books for every major box-office  milestone. It is the fastest film in history to ever reach the $100 million  mark  (7 days), the $150 million mark (12 days) and the $200 million mark (21 days). On its way it also captured the box-office records for highest single  day gross, biggest opening weekend gross, biggest three-day gross and  biggest
five-day gross. 

<P></P>

On its way to a gross of over $300 million ($286  million  to date) at the box office, it currently ranks as the No. 6 film of all time. The www.ID4.com has become the most-visited film website of all time,  totaling more than 75 million "hits" since its inception.

<B>Opening the Doors again
</B>
   

<P></P>

 Graphix Zone  will release <I>The Doors</I> CO-ROM, bringing the music, the magic, and the history of J.M. and the band. With two founding members graduates of the UCLA Film School, it was
inevitable that The Doors' original mix of jazz, California-surf flamenco guitar and Chicago blues would explode into a primordial mix of drama and music that is just as relevant today as it was nearly three  decades  ago. 

<P></P>

 In 1993, when they were inducted into the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame, the surviving members of The Doors once again brought the house down with  a  live Jam of Doors classics <I>Break On Through, Light My Fire</I> and  <I>Roadhouse Blues </I>featuring Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder on vocals.

<B>Party time, again</B>

   <I>Party of Five</I>, the  companion soundtrack to the series of the same  name  on FOX, will be released this week by Reprise Records.  A combination of songs exclusive to the show, new releases from artists and  <I>Party of Five</I> season favorites, the soundtrack features  cuts from the Bodeans, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, BT with Tori Amos, Chaka Khan  with Bruce Hornsby, Holly Palmer, Joe Jackson, Laurie Sargent, Nanci Griffith, Rickie Lee Jones, Howard Jones, Rusted Root, Shawn Colvin, Stevie Nicks  and Syd Straw.
      <I>Party of Five</I>, which was the winner of the 1996 Golden Globe Award  For Best Drama Series, explores the lives of the five Salinger brothers and sisters determined to stay together following the tragic loss of their parents.

    <B> King David gets contract at last
</B>
     

<P></P>

  Alan Menken and Tim Rice's <I>KING DAVID </I>will open the historic, newly renovated New Amsterdam Theatre, it was announced today by Michael D. Eisner, chairman and CEO and Michael S.  Ovitz, president of The Walt Disney Company. <I>KING DAVID</I> will be a  world  premiere concert event based on the story of the shepherd boy who was chosen to be  king of Israel and is being produced by Walt Disney Theatrical Productions  in association with Andre Djaoui. Performances of KING DAVID will begin  on  May 20, 1997 and run through May 24, 1997 for five performances only.
    

<P></P>

 "King David is a hero for all time whose life is one of history's  greatest stories," said Eisner. "Alan Menken and Tim Rice have been  key  creative forces behind six of our most successful productions, and we are excited to  be working with them again.  We also look forward to working with noted producer Andre Djaoui."
  

<P></P>

   Eisner said the world premiere concert event is the first step toward a possible "theatricalization" of KING DAVID.  "Three of Tim Rice's earlier works, 'Chess,' 'Evita' and 'Jesus Christ Superstar,' were performed as concert events before they were expanded into full scale musicals,"  Eisner noted. 
    

<P></P>

 This production of KING DAVID will mark the third time that Menken  and Rice have been a composer/lyricist team on a Disney  production.  Previously, they collaborated to expand the score for the stage version of the 1994 Tony(R) Award winning "Beauty and the Beast."  Likewise, they wrote three songs together for the blockbuster hit "Aladdin" including "A Whole New  World"
for which they received an Academy(R) Award.
   

<P></P>

  "The New Amsterdam Theatre has been called the 'crown jewel' of  Broadway and we are pleased to rededicate this legendary theatre with a dynamic  new work by Alan Menken and Tim Rice," said Ovitz. Plans are underway  for  a live cast recording of this world premiere concert event to be released later in the year."

Talentless actor runs for 'Daylight'</B>

    <P></P><I>Daylight,</I>  Universal Pictures' suspenseful action-drama starring Sylvester Stallone, will open nationwide  December 6. The release of <I>Daylight</I>,  Stallone's  31st motion picture, coincides with the 20th anniversary of the blockbuster film that first catapulted the actor to international superstardom, the  Academy Award-winning <I>Rocky</I>. As if.
  <P></P>  In<I> Daylight</I>, a devastating accidental explosion traps a small group of people in the Manhattan Tunnel, an underwater commuter roadway linking  New York City with New Jersey.  As more and more sections of the tunnel collapse behind and in front of them, the survivors - ordinary citizens from all  walks of life - come to the terrifying realization that they may die at any  moment by suffocation, drowning or fire.   As if. 
   <P></P>The only hope rests with Kit Latura
(Sylvester Stallone), an ex-Emergency Medical Services chief, who risks his life in a harrowing journey through the tunnel's unstable ventilation system in order to reach them.  As if. But once inside the tunnel, Kit becomes  trapped  with them, and he begins a race against time and the elements as he improvises a roller-coaster ride of escape to lead the group back to daylight. As if.

<H2>william kennedy: iron will & 'Ironwood'</H2> 
<h3><i>by nicholas a. basbanes</i></h3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

   Albany, N.Y., author William Kennedy spent several decades of his adult life as a journalist who "did it all,'' from covering politics, sports, spot news and crime to writing obituaries, columns, reviews, and editorials. 
<p>
   But somewhere along the way, he maintains, "something happened to my head and I turned into a novelist." The result of this creative metamorphosis has been the production of what Kennedy calls his Albany Cycle, a series of related books that do for New York's capital city what the Snopes, Sartoris, Benbow and Compson families did for the region in northern Mississippi that William Faulkner called Yoknapatawpha County.
<p>   Titles in Kennedy's oeuvre include <I>The Ink Truck Legs, Billy Phelan's Greatest Game, Ironweed, Quinn's Book</I> and<I> Very Old Bones</I>, to which now is added <I>The Flaming Corsage</I> (Viking, $23.95), a daring exploration of unbridled passion and the power of the imagination that turns on two events separated by three decades. 
   <p>At 209 pages, <I>The Flaming Corsage</I> is the most compactly written work in Kennedy's cycle, yet because of a clever structure that incorporates an actual disaster, slashing jumps in time, coinciding plots, a bona fide mystery and a fragmentary play-within-a-novel, it just may be his most ambitious. And his dialogue, as always, is crisp, evocative and unfailingly on target. 
<p>   "I started thinking about this right after I finished work on <I>Billy Phelan</I> in 1976, and my intention at that time was to write a whole play, and have a play and a novel in the same volume,'' Kennedy said in a recent interview. "The play would be a kind of coda, a parallel element, and they would work together."
<IMG SRC="/november/cranium.gif" WIDTH=220 HEIGHT=174 HSPACE=15 ALIGN=left>

<p>    Once embarked on the project, though, Kennedy encountered problems. "I found at that time that to write a whole play would be ambitious beyond my capacity," he said, especially since the play in question was to be written by Edward Daugherty, a renowned playwright whose experiences are at the center of<I> The Flaming Corsage.</I>
<p>   "My primary purpose, I do believe, was an unconscious one, to make myself equal to Edward Daugherty, in order to invent him,'" Kennedy said with a wry smile. He also encountered a few other problems, not all of them structural.
<p>   "I just didn't know who all these people were at the time," he continued. "I had some ideas about them, but I didn't really know, to cite one instance, what happened in the love nest," by which he was referring to the opening scene of the book where an unidentified man bursts into a Manhattan hotel room, kills his wife, wounds another man - Edward Daugherty, it turns out - and then commits suicide; another woman in the room, an actress, escapes unharmed. 
<p>  "It was all a mystery to me, and the reason it was a mystery is because everybody was lying," Kennedy said. "They were lying to me as well as lying to one another, and it took me many, many thrusts and parries to arrive at the conclusion of who was in there, and what they were doing in there."
<p>   Putting <I>The Flaming Corsage</I> aside, Kennedy proceeded to write <I>Ironweed</I>, which focused on the redemptive homecoming of Francis Phelan, a former professional baseball player turned alcoholic vagabond, and the father of Billy the pool shark, the title character of <I>Billy Phelan's Greatest Game</I>. 
<p>   Easily one of the great American novels of the past 25 years, <I>Ironweed</I> was a best-seller that provided the basis for an exceptional film, won the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award in 1983, and persuaded the MacArthur Foundation to give Kennedy a $250,000 "genius grant."
<p>   Coincidental to the recent publication of <I>The Flaming Corsage</I> in hardcover is release in trade paperback of <I>An Albany Trio </I>(Penguin, 606 pages, $17.95), which gathers in one volume Legs, <I>Billy Phelan's Greatest Game</I> and <I>Ironweed</I>.
<IMG SRC="/november/haunt.gif" WIDTH=220 HEIGHT=278 HSPACE=15 ALIGN=right>
<p>   Of particular interest is Kennedy's introduction to the collection called <I>Prelude in a Saloon</I>, a six-page piece that explains - in the form of a short story - how, in Kennedy's words, "the Albany Cycle came to be." It is a must read for any reader interested in the highways and byways of a consummate novelist's fictive road map, and provides a window into the workings of the creative process.
<p>   "I decided, for this little piece, to make Danny Quinn the  author of the Albany Cycle," Kennedy explained during our interview. "I chose Danny because he connects with everyone. He is Francis Phelan's grandson. He's George Quinn and Peg Phelan's son, just 10 years old in <I>Ironweed</I>. He grows up and goes into the Army, and he's a pal of Orson Purcell in <I>Very Old Bones</I>. They were in the Army together in Germany. He's also the grandson of Daniel Quinn of<I> Quinn's Book</I>."
<p>   As complicated as these relationships may sound, they are clear to appreciate readers of the Albany Cycle, especially since each book is propelled along by its own narrative force.
<p>   In the introductory piece to <I>An Albany Cycle</I>, Danny Quinn is interviewing Morty Besch, an old gangster who used to hang out with Legs Diamond. The meeting has been set up by Billy Phelan, who becomes prominent in the conversation, convincing Danny that Billy needed his own book, which in due course meant he had to
write the story of Billy's father Francis.
<p>   Thus was born a concept which Danny Quinn/William Kennedy describes as "an open-ended cycle of lives: the story of one man or woman begetting another, all of them counting time in the shared continuum of common ground, common history."
<p>And taken together, Quinn/Kennedy concludes, the corpus emerges as a sequence of "tragicomedies" that are distinctively different from one another, yet "kindred as blood: a mosaic of space, a collage of time."

<H2>weights & measures</H2>
<h3>sapphire : when push comes to shove</h3>
<B>by nicholas a. basbanes</B>
<blockquote>
<img src=sapphire.jpg align=right width=176 height=220>
For 10 years of her adult life, a writer known as Sapphire lived in a tenement off Lenox Avenue in the heart of Harlem, a real-life setting she has used impressively in a controversial novel of misery and redemption called <I>Push</I> (Knopf, 179 pages, $20).
<p>  In the novel, Claireece Precious Jones, a 16-year-old girl known simply as Precious, relates the horrific details of a stolen childhood without hint of guile or false pathos. 
<p>  The degradations Precious has endured range from the obscene to the unspeakable. Yet, in an oddly affecting way, her story is one of measured triumph, not abject defeat, and the instrument of her bittersweet victory is the awakening gift of literacy.
<p>  Precious is a desperately impoverished African-American child of the 1980s who is profoundly abused by her dysfunctional parents and ignored by a largely indifferent society. Overweight and ridiculed by other children, her language is the language of the woefully uneducated - broken, minimally functional, and totally devoid of conventional verbal forms.
<p>  Virtually enslaved and frequently abused by a slothful mother, Precious tells of being repeatedly raped and degraded by her father for most of her life. As the novel opens, she is pregnant by him for a second time. 
<p>   Later, Precious will learn that she is HIV positive, a devastating disclosure that lets the reader know the fragility of her long-term prospects, and wonder what will become of her first child, a 4-year-old girl with Down's Syndrome, and Abdul, her 2- year-old son.
<p>  With so many daunting obstacles placed cleverly in the child's path, it is easy to describe<I> Push</I> as a work of anger, defiance and accusation, which is how some readers, including a number of African-Americans sensitive to the portrayal of the girl's socially parasitic parents, and men of all races who perceive themselves as the enemy, have already responded. 
<p>  But then there is the matter of the girl's participation in an alternative education program, and the attention she gets from an inspired teacher who introduces her to the rudiments of reading, encourages her to maintain a daily journal, and communicates with her through writing.
<p>   Toward the end of the novel, Precious tells how she enjoys sitting with her son in the dayroom of a halfway house, where she is living apart from her mother:
<p>   "The sun is coming through the window splashing down on him, on the pages of his book. It's called  The Black BC's I love to hold him on my lap, open up the world to him. When the sun shine on him like this, he is an angel child. Brown sunshine. And my heart fill."
<p>   The strikingly mixed reaction to <I>Push </I>-  which gets its title from the instructions Precious receives from nurses during childbirth - has not been lost on the author, a 45-year-old California native who moved to New York City in 1977 with hopes of getting an education and becoming a writer.
<p>   Sapphire, also known by her family name, Ramona Lofton, worked as a go-go dancer near Times Square to support herself while attending City College, where she graduated win 1983. For the next seven years, she taught reading to teenagers and adults in Harlem and the Bronx.
<p>   "The address is made up in the novel, but I lived in the building where Precious grows up for 10 years," Sapphire said during a recent interview.  
<p>   "I saw a generation of kids who were 6 and 7 when I got there have babies, go off to jail, get killed. I'm in the neighborhood seeing all that, and at the same time I'm teaching, and it's devastating to me."
<p>   The daughter of a career Army sergeant who grew up on military bases around the country, Sapphire said she changed her name while living in San Francisco during the 1970s. 
<p>  "Everybody took a gemstone name during the days of the New Age movement," she said with a light laugh. "And there was a time in African-American culture where 'Sapphire' had a negative connotation - so I took the name to make a statement."
<p>   After graduating from City College, Sapphire enrolled in a master of fine arts program at Brooklyn College, where she studied writing under the novelist Susan Fromberg Schaffer, who recommended she show a rough draft of<I> Push</I> to a literary agent.  Knopf offered her a two-book contract for $500,000, and issued a 75,000-copy first printing of Push. 
<p>  Sapphire said Precious is a composite of several children she knew, and is not modeled on any single individual. 
<p>  "The good news is that two-thirds of African-American children have made it out of poverty. This book is for the one-third who remain behind. For a victim of repeated failure like Precious to break out and come into language is as good as graduating from Harvard."
<p>   For those who think of Push as an "angry book" Sapphire replies by saying that anger was not her intent. "I didn't write it to make people feel bad or to make people feel guilty," she said. 
<p>  "I think of it as a window with the shade pulled down. You open the shade, and you can see. This was something that most people hadn't been able to see before. Now they can see it."

<B>Welcome to December's issue</B>
 <P></P> Don't let a little hoarfrost get you down.<P></P> 

<b>george jr.</b>
is here to bring you a cup of nog and a hodge of writing
                                                         talent, book 
talk, wishful thinking,  art
                                                         and literary 
links and, we hope, a measure of digitized comfort.

<P></P> 
<br clear=all>
<blockquote>   
   This month,<B> Wendell Berry </B>talks about technology and ecology. Gnostic bibliophile <B>Harold Bloom</B> eyes religion as the century grows a beard. The Canadian essayist <B>Margaret Visser</B>, an old favorite here, writes about, oh, we've just forgotten. In "The Joy of Lex," correspondent <b>Nicholas A. Basbanes</b> found out <B>Donald Hall,</B> who muses on what makes his much acclaimed poems tick. And <B>Kitty</B>, of course, tells or gives you what for.  Dublin painter <B>Michael Bowers</B> contributed this month's oil-on-linen cover painting, titled "Color Study - George Myers Jr.," posed in the manner of <b>James Whistler</b>'s "Portrait of Thomas Carlyle."  The subject's hands, you'll note, are froze in html agony.<P></P> 
   <b>Patrick Lennon</b>, the novelist and short-story writer who begins contributing a "Letter from Key West" with this issue, is enjoying, by the way, better weather than most of us. "The Southernmost town" doth have its charms.  	"A number of years ago," he writes, "the 'Conch Republic' was created when the Customs
Service blocked US 1 to search for drugs. The Conch Republic immediately
surrendered to the Federal Government and asked for foreign aid.  Each year we celebrate the rebellion by throwing loaves of stale Cuban bread at representatives of the Federal Government."<P></P>
   
    Up to his elbows in work, <B>george jr.</B> is happy if you are - and also that this mild-mannered effort has been awarded "Hot Site" status by <i>USA Today</i> ; a "Cool" from Yahoo, Netsurfer Digest and <i>WebSight</i> , four stars from Magellan and Internet Voyager; applause, applause from the PRN Radio Network. <i>The Net</i>  magazine says we're "a good mark by which to judge all the rest," which gives us way too much performance anxiety.<P></P> 
    Ever dream a dream that you don't mind sharing? Send it or them to <a href="mailto:dreams@georgejr.com">george jr.'s dream issue</a> for just that; and don't miss participating in the fiction contest (well, really it's a sing-along) next month.<P></P> 
    Enjoy, because tomorrow the employees could go on strike.<P></P>

<h3>wendell berry: good neighborliness & technology</h3>

<P>
<img width=160 height=190 hspace=10 align=right src= wendell.jpg>
<br><br>
Kentucky farmer, grandfather and educator Wendell Berry is a winner of a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship, a National Institute of Arts and Letters Award  and a Lannan Foundation Award, all for his writings. He is the author of many books, including <I>What Are People For?, The Gift of the Good Land, The Hidden Wound, Another Turn of the Crank</I> and <I>The Memory of Old Jack.</I>

<blockquote>


<font size=5>q. </font>How would you define "appropriate technology"?
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font>Appropriate technology does not destroy the world or any part of it for the sake of ideas, ambitions or money.
<P></P>
<font size=5>q. </font> What needs to be done to preserve and to restore rural culture?
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font>Individuals need to understand that they have responsibilities of land stewardship both as producers and as consumers of food. The government needs to govern in the interest of the land and of the people, rather than in the interest of wealth and power. Communities need to turn their expectations from the government to themselves, and re-establish the principles of local economy, neighborliness, family order and stewardship.
<P></P>
<font size=5>q. </font>What do you perceive to be the cause and symptoms of economic and social decline in rural America?<br>
<font size=5>a. </font>The causes are ignorance and greed. The symptoms are silliness and waste.
<P></P>
<font size=5>q. </font>What do you see as urban people's connection to and responsibility toward land-use problems, which usually are considered to be solely rural issues.
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font>> Urban people are connected to the land by their gastrointestinal tract. If that connection should be broken, then the solely rural issue of land use would become an urban issue damned quick.
<P></P>
<font size=5>q. </font>Would you elaborate on your idea of a biblical or spiritual basis for ecological understanding?
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font>Some people have been saying that the Bible gives humans the right to use the earth in any way they wish. This is not true. In fact, the Bible says that the earth is a divine creation, and all creatures therefore participate in sanctity and are pleasing to God. The earth, moreover, is not given to humans. Humans are given the use of the fruits of the earth on the condition that they remain grateful for this gift and worthy of it. We have nothing to use that is not holy. This is more fearful and wonderful than most modern Christians suspect.
<P></P>
<font size=5>q. </font> In <I>The Hidden Wound</I>, you linked racial problems with agricultural ones. How are these connected?
<br>

<font size=5>a. </font> Most black people once were farmers, and then their problems were agricultural. Now most black people are living in the city, and their problems are partly urban. Like white people, black people would be better off if they had more agricultural problems and fewer urban ones.
<H3>
<P></P>
</font>
<font size=5>q. </font> What do you think about the popularity of personal computers?
<br>
<font size=5>a. </font> We used to have free personal computers - minds, which are now being replaced by expensive computers - machines. To me, "mind" is a better noun than "machine," and "free" a better adjective than "expensive."

<blockquote>
It isn't often that literary critics write books that become best sellers, but then only one literary critic is named Harold Bloom.<p>
<IMG SRC="typewr2.gif" WIDTH="63" HEIGHT="60" BORDER=1 ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" hspace=10 vspace =20>
   The man is a phenomenon, a reader in the purest sense who lives for the kind of nourishment that only the written word can provide. If the truth be known, Bloom's passion for knowledge has caused him to endure countless nights without sleep, and has contributed in the past to a severe case of bleeding ulcers and to a serious heart 
condition that required major surgery.<p>   Among the 22 books Bloom, 66, has written over the past 40 years, two of the most recent were surprisingly popular releases that prompted considerable controversy when they appeared.<p>
   In <I>The Book of J,</I> his 1990 book, Bloom boldly argued that a key text of the early Hebrew Bible was written by a woman, a hypothesis that occasioned brisk arguments in theology schools around the country.<p>
   Four years later, in <I>The Western Canon</I>, Bloom unequivocally articulated his position in a spirited debate that first surfaced a decade earlier, chiefly among feminist, Marxist, multicultural and Afrocentrist critics, and champions, like himself, of the traditional icons of Western literature. <P>
<P>
<H4>Dead White European Males</H4>

   At issue was the burning question of whether or not writers like Homer, Dante, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Cervantes, Rousseau, Goethe and Tolstoy, "Dead White European Males," as they are dismissively called in some academic circles, are "relevant"  to today's society, and whether they should continue to be taught in
American schools.<p>
<IMG SRC="deadwhite.gif" align=right WIDTH="230" HEIGHT="159" BORDER="0" hspace=10>
   In his latest effort, <I>Omens of Millennium</I> (Riverhead Books, 253 pages, $24.95), Bloom demonstrates a willingness to take on yet another brace of timely issues. The subtitle of this new book, "The Gnosis of Angels, Dreams, and 
Resurrection," clearly suggests a spiritual theme, but the genesis for the book goes far deeper than intellectual curiosity.  <p> "This is a very strange book, a weird book," Bloom readily offered during a recent interview at his home in New Haven, Conn., a short distance from Yale University where, as Sterling Professor of Humanities, he has the uncommon distinction of chairing a department of one.<p>
  "The problem with this book," he continued deliberately, "is that it's impossible to classify as a genre. It's not really a book about religion, even though the last chapter is a sermon. Maybe, in some sense, this entire book is a gnostic sermon. That's probably the answer - a gnostic sermon."<p>
   At that thought, Bloom laughed heartily. "A gnostic sermon is a joke, you see, since there can not be a gnostic sermon." He then explained what he meant by this. <p>
 "There can be a Protestant sermon, there can be a Judaic sermon, there can be a Muslim sermon, there can be a Catholic sermon, there can , I suppose, be a Buddhist sermon. But there can not be a gnostic sermon. That is because there is no one to
give it and no one to listen to it. And no place to hold it."<p>
   With that seeming paradox, Bloom laughed once again, and his good humor was contagious. Gnosticism, he pointed out, is a concept arguing that the knowledge of God resides in each  individual. <P>
<P>
<H4>The obsession with angels</H4>

   Indeed, the word  "gnosis" is generally defined to mean mystical or spiritual knowledge. Gnosticism has its roots in such ancient traditions as Jewish mysticism, Hellenistic mystery cults, Iranian religious dualism known as Zoroastrianism, and
Babylonian and Egyptian mythology. Widely influential in its time, much of early Christian doctrine was formulated in reaction to the Gnostic movement.
<br>

<br clear=all>
<IMG SRC="angels2.gif" WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="222" BORDER=0 ALIGN="LEFT">

  More to the point of  <I>Omens of Millennium</I>, though, is the wide-ranging discussion Bloom offers on the current fascination in popular culture for angels, prophetic dreams, the near-death experience, and New Age philosophy.<p>
   "This book, in a sense, has been moving around in me for half-a-century, but the occasion for writing it was bemusement with this obsession that people, all of a sudden, have with angels, and this insane preoccupation with the near-death
experience, upon which I would say, well, all of life is a near-death experience."<p>



   Upon further contemplation, Bloom said he decided to write about a Western 
tradition of dream interpretation that goes back some 1,900 years before the writings of Sigmund Freud, and to include a deeply informed historical discussion of angels and
near-death experience through history.<p>
   "I thought I would write a gently humorous account trying to say, look, this New Age jazz is no good, and this popular debasement is no good either. There are all these people who buy these terrible New Age books, there are people who read all this
drivel about near-death experience, who read all this incredibly bad psychic dream stuff; so I wondered, do they have an authentic drive to understand what these matters really represent?"<p>
   On an elemental level, he added, the reason people are moved by such concerns, "is that this has always been the tradition of gnosis. This book took me two full years to write; it took as long to write this book as it did to write that huge book on the Western Canon."<p>
   The reason it took him two full years, he said after a meaningful pause, "was because I couldn't quite understand it myself at the start. I kept writing it and rewriting it. And finally, it wrote itself, more or less."<p>
   After another long pause, Bloom said, "I really have no idea what is going to happen to this book; I take it for granted that many reviewers will just be outraged by it."<p>

<H3>i'll never forget whatshisname
</H3>
<B>by margaret visser</B>
<p>
"I know we've met somewhere. I remember your face" -- desperate pause-- "but your name escapes me." Age might be partly to blame, of course: decreasing numbers of grey cells. We also like to point to greatly expanding numbers of people met, and constantly increasing knowledge for the brain to keep on file. Whatever the reason, while many of us claim that we never forget a face, hardly anyone seems immune from failures to remember people's names.
<br clear=all>
<blockquote>
People used to be far more adept at remembering than we are; our recording machinery has atrophied our memories considerably. Yet any ancient Roman of consequence strolled about with a nomenclator at his elbow; this slave's job was to tell his master the names of people he met. American Presidents, imitating the Romans, are often supplied with a similar service. It has never been easy to put names to faces.<P>
The face is the primary human means of expression, a person's front to the world, even the seat of personal honour. We learn in infancy to be extremely skillful at noticing and interpreting the tiniest details of other people's faces. But just how it is that we recognize them is unknown. Some scientists have thought that we might have a special faculty in the brain just for fitting facial images to those we have previously encountered and stored away for reference. <P>

<IMG SRC="vissermen.gif" WIDTH="220" HEIGHT="273" BORDER=0 ALIGN="right">

Names are far less complicated, and in fact much easier to recall, than faces are. Indeed we rarely do recall a face; rather we recognize it on encountering it again. Recognition is always easier than recall: we can usually read a language, for example, before we can speak or write it. A person's name, on the other hand, is not usually in sight when we meet its owner: we have to dredge it up wholly from memory.<P>
We are easily irritated if, after introductions, the first question is "What do you do?" Who cares what we do? It's ourselves-- our faces, in the first instance-- that count. The question, however, is an attempt to grasp a person's identity. (It is an awkward cultural trait of ours that jobs tend to supply summary identities.) Meaning is essential to memory, and proper names are usually meaningless. They are therefore normally remembered only in third place: faces first, then identities, then-- if we get that far-- names. Identifying characteristics, however, might actually block retrieval of a name. A professor I know once met an ex-student whose face failed to elicit anything further than "C+."<P>
<P>
Busy modern people are often tired, distracted, and full of stress. All this is bad for the memory. We have little relationship-- that is, meaningful connection-- with many people whose names we are nevertheless expected to remember. And despite the myth that we are non-conformist, differences among people-- clothing, facial expression, manner-- are decidedly less pronounced than they used to be.<P>
<P>
Above all, we have to take in faces and names far too quickly. It has been shown that short-term memory for such a thing as a name turns into long-term memory after eight seconds of application. If we could take eight seconds to contemplate a face and attach it mentally to a name, we would be very likely to remember the connection. (You must not count the seconds, or you would not be concentrating.) But eight seconds of staring, at a slick modern gathering, would seem an eternity; such deliberation might even be construed as improper.<P>
<P>
Handbooks provide ploys for those who would remember names and influence people. One such device is vocal repetition: "pleased to meet you, Margaret. Margaret, I might have met you before. Were you at the Miami Conference, Margaret?" Another is inventing bizarre connections, name to face; for example, Matt Brown's face might be pictured on a brown doormat. Or we could try memorizing the names of important people in advance of the function at which they are to be met. We are chillingly advised to seek out only the people who bear those names, and ignore the rest; we will probably never meet them again anyway. (Modern people often expect not to meet others again: it is another reason not to pay attention to them.)
<P>
And when you are really anxious to remember names, one author suggests, you can always phone home and leave a list of the important ones (with identifying descriptions) on your own answering-machine.<P>

<H3>letter from key west:</H3>

<H2>

fat albert
</H2>
<P>

<B> by patrick a. lennon</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

     High above Cudjoe Key, bathed in tropical sunlight, Fat Albert floated in the dwindling trade winds.  To the north of him, the shallow green water of Florida Bay was slick as a mossy  slate roof.  On the ocean side of the key, languid blue rollers, reluctant to reach the craggy island, petered out near the reef a quarter mile from shore.  It was August, hot, steamy, and very  still.<P>
<P>



     Fat Albert, a blimp tethered to Cudjoe Key, carried  sophisticated radar systems, and was officially known as a Tethered Airborne Radar System.  Technicians at the TARS base  tracked low flying airplanes, drug boats, and whatever else interested the CIA, FBI, DEA, and the Weather Bureau.<P>
<P>



     On this sweltering August afternoon, Fat Albert's radar observers tracked a line of thunderstorms, approaching from the north.  Yellow and red blips on the Doppler radar screen  identified areas of severe turbulence and dangerous wind-shear. The TARS commander ordered Fat Albert's ground crew to winch him down.
<P>
<P>



<IMG SRC="typewr2.gif" WIDTH="63" HEIGHT="60" BORDER=1 ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" hspace=10 vspace =20>

 Fishing the reef on the ocean side, Pepe had a sizable catch of grouper and yellow tail 
snapper.  It was his lucky day he thought, as he eyed the nearly full fish box.  After selling the  fish, he planned to hitch a ride to Key West for an evening of marijuana and unhurried sex with Rose, his favorite prostitute.
<P>
<P>

          She liked his tattoo with her name encased in a heart, but she didn't ask about the dagger through the heart.
<P>
<P>


 He popped the tab-top on his last can of Coors, wiped his face with a red bandana, and sprawled across a seat, waiting for another fish to bite.   He glanced southward toward Cuba and wondered what his mother and father were doing at that very moment.
<P>
<P>


  At his parents small home near the beach at Cojimar, Pepe guessed that his father was playing dominoes with his friends on the front porch, and his mother was in the kitchen, steaming  rice and stirring a pot of black beans for the evening meal.  He could almost smell the pungent aroma of the black beans.
<P>
<P>


               He wiped his face with the bandana, looked around, and saw the huge black cloud bearing down on him.  Quickly, he wound his tackle on the hand reels and scrambled to retrieve the anchor.
<P>
 <P>
          He yanked on the anchor line.  The anchor was fouled in the coral.  He cursed his laziness for not setting the trip line. As he stood in the bow of his fifteen-foot boat, tugging on the anchor, the cool and sweet aroma of the storm enveloped him, but the roiling black cloud made him uneasy.  "Damn," he thought. "It might be a rough ride home."
<P>
<P>

     At the TARS base, a lightning bolt zapped a transformer. The clutch on Fat Albert's winch disengaged, and cable unspooled with an ear splitting whine.  When the emergency generator  restored power, the clutch engaged with a grinding sound and stripped the gears on the drive wheel.  Now, the huge reel shrieked as it spun out of control.  The supervisor ratcheted the  emergency brake rearward, but it overheated and failed.
<P>
<P>

<IMG SRC="compas.gif" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="66" ALIGN="right" BORDER="0" hspace=10>
     Fat Albert's handlers recoiled when lightening snaked down the cable and exploded 
in the machinery.  The cable snapped.  Fat Albert was free and heading south, dragging his cable through a stand of loblolly pines.
<P>
<P>

     Flailing wildly, the cable cracked like a mule skinner's  whip, as it wrapped around trees, stripping them bare.  Fat  Albert dragged the cable across US 1, snaring overhead power  lines and ripping them from the poles.  In the driving rain and
 growing darkness, bluish green sparks hissed between electrical  wires and Fat Albert's cable.
<P>
<P>

     On the reef, the anchor line rasped Pepe's calloused hands,  as he frantically tried to pull the anchor free.  Like bullets,  heavy drops of rain ricocheted off the boat and stung Pepe's bare  skin.  The waves grew.  Zigzag tracers of lightening crackled
 between the ocean and cloud, followed by explosive thunder,  unnerving to Pepe.  Ice cold winds plummeted from the leading  edge of the black cloud, hammering the ocean with fury, while violent updrafts sucked warm moist air into the cloud's belly.
<P>
<P>

          Like charges of black gun powder, the moist air fueled the  raging storm.  Ice cold rain, driven by the gale, riddled Pepe's bare skin.  He shivered from rain and shrank from pitching seas, lightening, and crushing thunder.  Pepe knew it was his most
 unlucky day.
<P>
<P>

               He located his dull filet knife and frantically sawed through the anchor line.  When the boat lurched free of the anchor, it turned broadside into the wind and violently rocked  in the foaming green water.  Pepe was nearly thrown clear, but 
 luckily stumbled to the transom seat.  He pulled the starting lanyard on the outboard engine.  It didn't start.
<P>
<P>

               Pepe pulled the lanyard again and his hand slipped off the lanyard, smashing his knuckles on the gunwale.  Cursing in Spanish, which he felt had more authority, he yanked the  lanyard again.  The old Evinrude, difficult to start under ideal circumstances, sputtered and died.
<P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="compas2.gif" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="101" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" hspace=10 vspace =20>

               Fat Albert's cable, snarled with tree limbs, raced across Cudjoe Key to the ocean side.  The heavy rain and icy down drafts pressed Fat Albert close to the boiling 
ocean.  A hundred feet over Pepe, it gyrated wildly.  Pepe thought it would crash on him, but Fat Albert raced southward.  Pepe muttered a quick thanks to God for averting disaster and pulled on the engine's lanyard, when a ripsaw noise startled him.  He turned away  from the motor and watched dumbfounded, as Fat Albert's braided 
cable dragged across the gunwale, rasping the soft wood.  Just as  Pepe thought the cable would saw the boat in half, a violent gust steered Fat Albert eastward, and the cable snagged between the  outboard motor and the transom.  The boat followed Fat Albert.
<P>
<P>

     When another gust turned Fat Albert south, the boat's  transom lifted out of the water.  Pepe gripped the seat as the  boat's speed increased.  In less than a minute, he was going  thirty miles per hour, backwards.  "Holy shit," he exclaimed in
 English.
<P>
<P>

     Pepe watched Fat Albert gradually begin to rise.  The rain  slacked and the wind decreased.  Fat Albert was now in bright  sunshine.  The waves gradually lowered, and when Pepe reached the  sunshine, the ocean was flat.  The boat slowed.  Fat Albert had  saved him.  It was surely his lucky day.
<P>
<P>

     As the sun warmed Fat Albert, his white skin grew taut and  he rose higher.  Pepe watched the cable trail Fat Albert up into  the blue sky.  Then, the cable lifted Pepe and his boat clear of  the water.  Pepe, amazed that he was flying, didn't consider 
jumping out of his boat until he was too high above the water.
<P>
<P>

     The TARS commander phoned Boca Chica Naval Air Station,  identified himself as Colonel Clendennen, and explained to the  Operations Officer that Fat Albert was drifting southward.  "He's  heading to Cuba."  Clendennen tried to sound calm, but his voice  was an octave higher than normal.  "We can't let Fat Albert's  sophisticated radar antennas fall into the hands of the Cuban  Government," Clendennen said.
<P>
<P>

     "What do you want me to do?"  The naval officer asked.
<P>
<P>

     "Shoot him down."
<P>
<P>

     After a pause, the naval officer asked,  "Really?"
<P>
<P>



               The naval officer heard the rustling of papers.
<P>
<P>

               "According to the procedure manual, I'm ordered to  destroy the blimp if it appears that it will fall into the hands of a hostile government.  The Department of Defense has classified Cuba as a hostile government."
<P>
<P>

               "I'm not sure,"  the naval officer said.  "I'll have to clear it with the base commander."
<P>
<P>

               "How long will that take,"  Clendennen asked.
<P>
<P>

               "I'm not sure.  I'll get back to you."
<P>
<P>

               "Hurry,"  Clendennen said.  "Fat Albert's last position  was twenty miles south of Ramrod Key, moving thirty miles per  hour.
<P>
<P>

          At that speed, the blimp should reach Cuba within three hours.
<P>
<P>

          That's after sunset."
<P>
<P>

               The naval officer copied down the telephone number and  radio            frequency of the TARS operations center.
<P>
<P>

               When Clendennen hung up the phone, he ordered Fat  Albert's twin brother sent aloft to track Fat Albert's progress with radar.
<P>
<P>

               "It's my lucky day,"  Pepe said, as he slid a boat  cushion beneath him.  His back rested against the bottom of the boat.
<P>
<P>

          Surprisingly, the fish box had wedged in the bow and not one  fish had been lost.  "It's most surely my lucky day,"  Pepe said  aloud to no one.
<P>
<P>

               Pepe, who had never flown before, saw freighters steaming below him in the brilliant blue water.  They looked like toys.
<P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="typewr2.gif" WIDTH="63" HEIGHT="60" BORDER=1 ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" hspace=10 vspace =20>
          As he studied the blue expanse of water, he recalled his trip from Cuba to the 
Florida Keys four years earlier.  He had  bobbed for five days on an inner tube and was nearly out of water, when  the Coast Guard rescued him.  "Now that I think of it, I've had a  lot of lucky days,"  Pepe said.
<P>
<P>

     As the blimp rose, Pepe became colder.  His damp clothes  felt like ice against his skin, and he briskly rubbed his arms  and legs.  The freighters below him were barely visible, but he  could clearly see the gentle hook that the Florida Keys made from  the Florida mainland to Key West.  He thought he would enjoy the  ride if he weren't so cold.

     At Boca Chica Naval Air Station, two "Tiger Cats" lifted off  the runway.  After the wingman tucked his plane close to the  leader, both planes turned south and began climbing with  afterburners thundering.  The flight leader established radio  contact with the TARS radio operator, who told them that Fat  Albert was now fifty miles north of Havana and level at ten  thousand feet.  A minute later the radar observers in the "Tiger  Cats" locked onto Fat Albert.
<P>
<P>

     "We've got a radar lock,"  the flight leader advised TARS.  "When I have visual contact, I'll let you know."
<P>
<P>

     "Roger,"  the TARS radio operator replied.  "The Coast Guard  cutter Broward should be on station in two hours to salvage  Albert."
<P>
<P>

     Another minute passed and the flight leader advised TARS  that they had visual contact with Albert.  TARS cautioned them to  be on watch for Albert's cable.
<P>
<P>

      After a pause, the flight leader said, "Uh, TARS we've got a  problem up here."
<P>
<P>



               "Problem?"
<P>
<P>

               "Uh, yeah.  Somebody just waved at me from a boat hooked  to Fat Albert's cable."
<P>
<P>

               "Who waved at you?"
<P>
<P>

               "I don't know.  We'll make another pass and check him out. Standby."
<P>
<P>

               Pepe watched the two jets roar past him and turn in a tight circle.  He could hear the powerful jet engines.  He wondered what they were doing.
<P>
<P>

               "Uh, TARS there is definitely someone in a boat hooked to Fat Albert.  What do you want us to do?"
<P>
<P>

               After a long pause, Cudjoe's radio operator said,  "Standby."
<P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="typewr2.gif" WIDTH="63" HEIGHT="60" BORDER=1 ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" hspace=10 vspace =20>

               Pepe gripped the seat with one hand and waved at the  passing pilots with the other.  He watched them make another circle,  and as they zipped less than a hundred 
feet from him, he yelled, "Hello!"
<P>
<P>

               The pilots made another circle.  At TARS, Colonel  Clendennen snatched the microphone away from the radio operator.  He  asked the pilots if the person was alive.
<P>
<P>

               "He waved at us,"  the flight leader reported.
<P>
<P>

               "Are you sure?"<P>
<P>


               "Actually, I think he yelled at us, too,"  the flight  leader   said.
<P>
<P>

               "You have to shoot Fat Albert down,"  Clendennen said.
<P>
<P>

               "Uh, I'm not sure that's a good idea.  Fat Albert's passenger might get killed."
<P>
<P>


     "What if you shot a single round to slowly let the helium  out of Fat Albert?"  Clendennen asked.
<P>
<P>

     "That might work,"  the flight leader said.  "I'll give it a  try."
<P>
<P>

     "Roger,"  Clendennen acknowledged.
<P>
<P>

     Pepe watched the planes circle and begin to climb.  He  craned his neck around the gunwale to see what they were doing.
<P>
<P>

     The flight leader armed his machine guns and locked his  sight on Fat Albert.  He depressed and released the trigger  quickly, then swerved up and over Fat Albert.  When he was clear  of Fat Albert he extended his dive brakes, slowed the "Tiger
 Cat," and rolled onto his back, executing a perfect split "S".
<P>
<P>

     Pepe had heard the sharp crack-crack of the Tiger Cat's guns  and felt his boat lurch.  "Holy shit,  they're shooting at me,"  Pepe shouted to no one.
<P>
<P>

     "I'm circling the blimp,"  the flight commander said.  "I'm  sure I put a hole in him.  What do you want me to do?"
<P>
<P>

     "Stand-by,"  the radio operator said.  "I'm waiting for  instructions."
<P>
<P>

     Clendennen studied the radar screen over the shoulder of the  technician.  As the seconds ticked by on the twenty-four hour  clock above the radar screen, he watched the digital readout  slowly begin to reduce.
<P>
<P>

     The technician punched a command into his computer and said,  "Fat Albert is descending at one hundred feet per minute.  At  that rate Fat Albert will splash in an hour and forty-five minutes. At his present drift, I'd expect him to land about fifteen miles north of the Cuban coastline."
<P>
<P>

               Clendennen ordered the radio operator to ask the flight leader to put another hole in the blimp.
<P>
<P>

               When the flight leader heard the request, he hesitated before saying, "Uh, we've got some company up here.  Two Cuban MIGs.  We'll break off from the blimp."
<P>
<P>

               The base commander's face turned crimson and he screamed, "Tell the flight leader to forget the Cubans.  Tell him to  shoot Fat Albert down."
<P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="phone.gif" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="120" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" hspace=10 vspace =20>

               The flight leader switched frequencies to Boca Chica Operations and didn't hear the transmission from TARS.  He explained the situation to the navy operations 
officer, who asked, "How's your fuel?"
<P>
<P>

               "Thirty minutes until "bingo,"  the flight leader said.
<P>
<P>

               "Better get back here.  I'll notify TARS that we'll send  up another flight."
<P>
<P>

               At TARS, Clendennen yelled at the radio operator,  "Where's the damned Coast Guard?"
<P>
<P>

               The radio operator changed frequencies on his console and radioed the Coast Guard Cutter Broward.  He advised the  Broward that Fat Albert would splash fifteen miles from Cuba.
<P>
<P>

               "Roger,"  the Broward replied.  We've got him in sight. What's his present altitude?"
<P>
<P>

               "Nine thousand,"  the radio operator replied, adding, "expect him to splash in one hour and thirty-five minutes."
<P>
<P>

     "Understand, nine thousand, one hour and thirty-five  minutes.  We're two hours north of Cuba.  It'll be close."
<P>
<P>

     Pepe sensed the gradual decent.  Except for being cold, he  wasn't uncomfortable.  "I wonder what's going on?"  He muttered,  watching four airplanes circle him.
<P>
<P>

     When two of the airplanes flew by him, he noticed the Cuban  insignia painted on their tails.  For a moment, he felt proud  seeing it.  Then it dawned on him that he must be drifting toward  Cuba.  He wiggled close to edge of the seat and looked over the
 side.  In the distance he saw Cuba.
<P>
<P>

     "Oh, no,"  he said.  "I'll be in trouble if I land there."  Beneath him he saw several fishing boats.  Above him, Fat Albert  seemed thinner.
<P>
<P>

     Now, only the two airplanes with Cuban insignia circled him.  The two American Navy jets streaked toward the Florida Keys.
<P>
<P>

     For an hour and thirty minutes, the Cutter Broward trailed  Fat Albert.  The radar operator notified the captain that the  Cuban coastline was fifteen miles ahead.  The captain studied the  radar screen for a few moments, then ordered the radio operator to ask TARS Fat Albert's altitude.
<P>
<P>

     "He's below five hundred feet,"  TARS replied.
<P>
<P>

     "Tell TARS that there must be a hundred small fishing boats  beneath Fat Albert,"  The Broward's captain said.
<P>
<P>

     Pepe saw the flotilla of boats beneath him.  Among the  flimsy fishing boats, three Cuban gunboats churned a foamy wake,  warning the fishermen to keep clear.
<P>
<P>

               In the growing darkness, four MIGs and four Tiger Cats circled Fat Albert.  Occasionally, a Tiger Cat dove and  threatened the Cuban gunboats.  Colonel Clendennen notified  the navy flight leader that they were three miles from the twelve
 mile territorial limit of Cuba.
<P>
<P>

               "You must shoot Fat Albert down in international water," Colonel Clendennen's shrill voice said.
<P>
<P>

               "Roger," the flight leader acknowledged.  "He's almost  down. I don't think we'll have to shoot him.  The Broward is moving into position."
<P>
<P>

<IMG SRC="typewr2.gif" WIDTH="63" HEIGHT="60" BORDER=1 ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" hspace=10 vspace =20>
               Colonel Clendennen switched frequencies to the Broward.
<P>
<P>

               "We're right beneath him,"  the Broward's captain said.   "He should splash in less than a minute.  It's getting dark out here."
<P>
<P>

               Fat Albert, his helium nearly exhausted, began a lazy spiral.  The Cuban gunboats maneuvered next to the Broward, ignoring Pepe's boat.
<P>
<P>

               The bow of Pepe's boat touched the water and the stern gently settled.  Almost immediately, a dozen fishing skiffs surrounded him.  Fat Albert's cable slacked, and Pepe easily lifted it over the outboard motor and dropped it into the  water.
<P>
<P>

          When a boat sidled next to him, Pepe asked, "Where am I?"
<P>
<P>

               "Cojimar," a bearded fisherman replied, pointing at the  soft twinkling lights of Cojimar.  "Aren't you Pepe Rodriguez?"
<P>
<P>

               "Si,"  Pepe replied.  "Aren't you Ramon Garcia?"
<P>
<P>

               "Si, where are you going?"
<P>
<P>

               "To have dinner with my parents."
<P>
<P>

     "They'll be glad to see you."
<P>
<P>

     Pepe pulled the lanyard on the outboard motor and it  immediately started.  He pointed the bow south and opened the  throttle.  "This surely is my lucky day,"  Pepe said, patting the  outboard motor.

<h2>george jr.'s favorite christmas</h2>
<p>




This is a story about my favorite Christmas, LBJ's grandfather, the Pony 
Express and a placenta named Miles. It's why, in my mind, there never 
shall be a separation between church and the state of Texas.<P>
<br clear=all>
<blockquote>
   It stars my sister Melissa, who, at the time, was a Texan by choice; 
as well as a big dog named Amber; many stagehands and producers and three 
midwives.<P>

In the last year of Elvis and the Volkswagen Beetle, Melissa,  drove to 
the Austin airport, in labor, to meet my mother, a Victorian woman named 
Virginia who had borne three children without ever having witnessed one 
birth. She was about to become a saint.<P>
   My sister, her husband and daughter lived in a ramshackle one-story 
clapboard house in Buda, Texas (pop. a visible 12). This chalky house 
with green fence, white upright piano and wood-burning stove had been a 
Pony Express way station in the 1800s, and the home of LBJ's grandfather 
a bit after that. It was not grand.<P>
   My father, my grandfather and I were Pennsylvanians. We knew little 
about Texas birthings but, awaiting all of this back home, where we were 
willing as a packed suitcase. Off we went.<P>
 <IMG SRC="holly2.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="42" BORDER=0
ALIGN="LEFT"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" BORDER="0">
  Melissa and her husband, Roland, 
were to introduce us to lots of interesting friends in the Bigger 'n' 
Better State. Several were midwives. One was a woman named Joanne who 
liked to sit around her house naked while goats roamed in and out of her 
house - unless she was in the midst of her cycle, in which case she would 
fling the goats off the porch and grouch around with a fierce 
countenance.<P>
   At 4 a.m. Dec. 15, Melissa pushed one last time and Miles Ethan Stock 
landed in the arms of Roland, the midwives, two fire stokers, a baby 
catcher and a masseuse named Kathryn who, very soon, I was to covet.<P>
   Christmas was about to begin.<P><P>
   When the Pennsylvanians arrived Dec. 22, my mother, now a ghostly 
white, was well on her way.<P>
   By the time we had arrived, the little house was jigsawed in its 
deploy, and everyone looked slightly stunned - as though Halley's Comet 
had hit full force, carried off several of them and plunked them back 
into the Texas scrub.<P>
   A short, squat dog named Rosie scurried through the legs of the 
midwives and friends while, outside, the large yellow being named Amber 
loped up and down the trumk of a live oak. I swear, that dog climbed 
trees.<P>
   Nearby was a little mound where Roland and Melissa had buried their 
baby's placenta, for good luck, they said. Texans are unlike you and 
me.<P>
   A lot had happened that week that never had happened before.<P>
   My mother, who took great pains to volunteer herself to my birthing 
sister, wilted at the sight of us.<P>
   It had been a trying week. She had tried to cook what she thought was 
a road runner she found in the freezer. (It wasn't. It was an 
experimental chicken from Texas A&M's veterinary school that Roland's 
father had beheaded prior to our arrival.) This odd shaped fowl would 
neither cook, steam, boil, fry nor bake, as my mother tried them all.<P>
 <IMG SRC="blender.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="46" HSPACE=10 BORDER=0
ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0">
 The kitchen was small and cramped, 
as a rubber hose lead from the the sink's faucet to a fig tree outside. 
Pasty hunks of oranges stuck to tables and chairs and walls, from 
frequent Juicerator accidents. Because the sink was given over to feeding 
the fig tree, Miles' diapers were washed in the toilet, which clogged and 
flushed back repeatedly onto adjacent kitchen floor.<P>
   My mother, who had blanched at a midwife's use of the word "pee" in 
front of her naked but grown-up daughter, and who had nearly fainted at 
the sight of Melissa's water breaking, and who had finally seen a birth 
from top to bottom, by now had a kerchief tied wildly around her head. 
The whites of her eyes were everywhere.<P>
   Within seconds of our arrival, I was smitten by a real Texan on the 
premises - the woman named Kathryn who lived with Roland and Melissa; and 
who, I was told, delivered impromptu massages. She had long brown hair 
and her skin was orange as a pumpkin's from Juicerating.<P>
   I bunked in the living room, pretending to read as she floated through 
the house, hair launching ships and battalions toward Troy; and my 
22-year-old brain percolated with heartfelt but indecent encounters. She 
ignored me utterly.<P>
   Mom, Dad and the Colonel, as I called my grandfather, bivouacked at a 
hotel some miles away. Each morning, they were slower and slower to 
return, even though Roland's family appeared at the house early and 
often.<P>
  <IMG SRC="john.gif" HSPACE=10 WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="42" BORDER=0
ALIGN="right"
BORDER="0" >

 Roland's parents were lovely but 
incessant talkers, which was tough on those of us who were trained from 
childhood to be incessant listeners. Once I found Roland hiding from them 
in his workshop, carving a clothespin.<P>
   In a day or two, a Christmas tree appaeared at the house, with 
Christmas balls. Caught up in the delirium, I dialed zero and sang "Merry 
Christmas" to the telephone operator, who sang it back.<P>
   The Colonel usually played a larger role in the family milestones, but 
he sat this one out, sipping Scotch on the front porch with my dad and 
wondering aloud why these "fine bullrushers  from Texas" never before 
heard of "Christmas balls." (But he and dad persevered: They managed to 
buy part of a store's Christmas display outright, driving it back to Buda 
and installing it at LBJ's grandfather's old place.<P>
Outside, in the air, blue birds and egrets sailed the currents of their 
migratory rivers; and Amber the Wonder Dog snatched fish from Big Onion 
Creek with powerful swipes of her paw to her mouth.<P>
   She could stand, storklike, moving nothing but her eyebrows, just 
waiting to strike.<P>
   Inside, lightening struck all week. Roland, who is more Lincolnesque 
than Lincoln, one day bumped his Texas-sized head against the house's 
stove pipe, knocking it from the stove and filling the house with soot 
and smoke.<P>
<IMG SRC="dog14.gif" WIDTH="51" HEIGHT="67" BORDER=0
HSPACE=10 ALIGN="LEFT"
BORDER="0">Having been caught up in the dramas 
of the house myself (and, of course, that unresolved lust), I developed a 
mild case of diarrhea and fled to the scrub - the bathroom toilet was 
kaput - to grip both hands around a live oak and pray. Quite 
unexpectedly, Amber nosed me from behind (just once) and I was cured.<P>
   Amber was what they called "a good ol' dog." She was trained to not 
chase the unusual breed of black deer or the cattle that grazed the 
rolling hills, but dogs do dig.<P>
   My mom, who was by now quaking and rattling from unproductively 
helping Melissa, was in the kitchen still volunteering and fairly mobile 
when Amber trotted in and coughed up something undesirable on her 
shoes.<P>
   It was the placenta, a yuletide gift that surpassed all others 
exchanged that day.<P>
   Saint Virginia is fine, now - never better, having since midwifed 
quite a few more people through various travails. Roland is still 
Lincolnesque, if not moreso. Miles is a strapping young man of 18. I love 
my sister Melissa.<P>
    Last I heard, Amber still roamed the plains of Texas.<P>
<P>

<H2>white house e-mail</H2>
Thanks to our friends at the National Security Archive, Tom Blanton and 
The New
Press, <b>george jr.</b> is able to bring you, raw and unplugged, 
genuine-article, top-secret
messages - from Blanton's book, White House E-mail - that the Reagan/Bush 
White
House tried to destroy. 
<P>
We'll bring you several of their actual email messages a week, until heck freezes over,  without editorial gloss.
<P>
<A HREF="whtech.html">Techies</A> will want to know: These messages are scanned ASCII  text files on DOS-formatted disk (edited by Blanton, produced by Ian Stevenson with technical gizmonics from John Martinez).
<P>
In case you've forgotten--here's a <A HREF="whwhowho.html">who's who</A>, the rogue's gallery from the Reagan-Bush years. And for those, who like us can  barely remember what we had for breakfast, here's a <A HREF="whchron.html">chronology</A> of  White House events.

NOTE FROM: OLIVER NORTH
Subject: Hill
Don, I am more than a little disturbed by yr note for the following 
reasons:
(1)  I have had no "recent appearances" on the hill
(2)  At what is referred to as "early middle age" I have few            
illusions about the meaning of the word "friends." I would point out 
that if these persons were friends, they would have called me, not you.
Given the points above, it would be good if we talked.  There is much 
to be done and very little timein which to do it.  This kind of business 
simply impedes progress when we need it most.

NOTE FROM: Lynn S. Sachs
SUBJECT: JMP calls on counterterrorism
Ollie mentioned this morning that he was sending talking points to 
JMP for calls to senators on the central america counterterrorism 
legislation.  I believe he will be recommending calls to Dole, Lugar 
and possibly Inouye.
I don't know if Ollie will recommend a sequence for the calls or not -- 
but it is very important that Lugar be called first.  Lugar has been very 
helpful on this issue and has been trying hard to bring the bill up on

submission of our contra request.  If you don't mind, say it is in follow-
up to the questions they raised with me yesterday. Also, ask Ron to 
explain to you what they told us yesterday about the Angolan finding 
that we are about to send up and what effect this is likely to have on

SUBJECT: Saudi arms
Lynn Sachs is checking with Lugar's staff on the basis of his optimistic 
assessment.  Hope to have an answer shortly.  Again, I suspect Lugar 
made a seat of the pants judgement.  If he had taken a head count, he 
would have gone to Dole at some point, and he obviously did not. 
  On the idea of notifying the whole package, then dropping MSIP, 
ALQ-171, and Blackhawks, I am pessimistic because:
 - the pressure wd be to drop out the missiles.
 - whatever was dropped out would be next to impossible to notify later 
this year.
 - it makes the President look weak and would be interpreted exactly 
that way in the Mideast.
 Have checked with Dick Murphy who also agrees we should not 
withdraw part of the package for the above reasons.

NOTE FROM: OLIVER NORTH
Subject: PRIVATE BLANK CHECK
Ref the Presidential speech for Sunday: Am very concerned that we 
may be coming to a serious problem w/ the televised speech. In accord 
w/ earlier guidance, we worked very closely w/ Ben Elliot to build a 
speech aimed at Congressional passage of the President's proposal to 
the Congress. With some tinkering, the draft Ben provided will do just 
that. It is aimed at the Congress -- thru the American people - and 
presents the issues in terms that they grasp in a non-partisan way on 
an issue of extraordinary national security importance. For whatever 
reason, Pat Buchanan had Tony Dolan do another draft. This 
alternative version is long on fear, anecdotal remarks and no clear end 
-- except that the Democrats should be blamed when it goes wrong. It 
practically assumes that the initiative will be voted down.

I believe -- right or wrong -- that we have a group at work here who 
are more intent on the 1988 elections than a democratic outcome in 
Nicaragua. You know that I feel very strongly about this -- or I wd not 
bother you by coming directly to you. I believe that this may well be 
our last chance to keep from having our sons -- and maybe you and I -- 
go to war in Central America. If we lose this vote because others were 
more intent on blaming the Democratic party/liberals for a disaster, 
this country will truly suffer irreparable damage. With some work, Ben 
Elliott's version of the Sunday speech will be an extraordinary help to 
a victory on the hill next week. I do not believe Tony's version will 
help us achieve this end. It may help the conservative cause in the 88 
elections but it won't help prevent the introduction of U.S. forces in 
1990 after everything has been lost in CentAm. Wd you pls look at 
both versions. I will go to work hard on whichever approach you 
direct, but wd vy much appreciate yr. views. Warm regards, North

NOTE FROM: OLIVER NORTH
Subject: PRIVATE BLANK CHECK
Follow up to yr last re the speech: Talked w/ Pat. He seems adamant. 
He has made some mods to the Dolan draft but insists we need a 
"highly emotional" presentation that indicts the Libs/Dems. Am more 
concerned than ever that we are headed down the wrong path with 
victory well within our grasp. Privately Pat is portraying the Skelton 
approach as capitulation. Well recognizing the practical limits of both 
power and time, I believe that if you can you should ask DTR not to 
send the Dolan draft to RR tomorrow as planned. Salient points: -- the 
two speeches are entirely different approaches; Elliott's lays out a 
structured presentation of the FACTS and the strategic threat as the 
Pres requested last Weds. Dolan's is a highly charged emotional 
appeal. -- If both speeches are to go forward, they must be read 
separately in their entirity. They are both so structurally different that I 
cannot find a way to stuff facts from Ben's into Tony's. -- Ben's version 
really does put the greatest pressure on the Congress without being 
inflammatory. We've gotten good milage out of the Buchanan piece on 
who supports America vs. who supports commies. The President is, 
and must stay above that.

-- Finally, in the for what it's worth dept - Kissinger stopped by for a 
chat this afternoon. I took the liberty of asking for his thoughts. In the 
four years I've known him I never heard him say "good" until today. 
His comment (after making some useful improvements - which we 
have incorporated) was "this is very good -it is just the right 
approach." Pls, if possible, talk to DTR before he sends the Dolan 
version fwd tomorrow. If you think it wd help, I wd be willing to talk 
to him. Wm regards, North

SUBJECT: Barnes trip to the Contadora Meetings
Barnes is planning to go to the Contadora Meetings this weekend.  It 
is now apparent that he may be talking with other members about 
joining him -- Slattery, Richardson, Jeffords and Ridge.  Talked to 
Will Ball about this and White House Legislative Affairs have talked 
to a number of our Republican friends.  While it is clear that we will 
undoubtedly not be able to turn the trip off we do want to be on the 
record that we think Congressional participation/ observation is 
inappropriate!  State has suggested that the President write to the 
Speaker asking him to "rein Barnes in".  Will agrees that Presidential 
involvement is not necessary and recommend someone at State 
(Abrams) call Barnes to express our concerns.  If Barnes is still 
determined to make the trip the Shultz will contact either the Speaker 
or Fascell to get on the record that the trip is a bad idea.  Politically we 
think Barnes may get so far out on a limb on this that his colleagues 
(Democrats and Republicans) will think that he has mingled where he 
does not belong.  From a substantive point of view, though Barnes' 
presence could cause problems.

Flo, pls print out following for the Admiral before his 2:00 p.m. 
meeting with Senator Humphrey and the President:
         
During Senator Humphrey's scheduled meeting with the President and 
you this afternoon, he intends to raise the following Afghan related 
issues:
--The Geneva proximity talks.  Humphrey is concerned about 
instrument 4 and possibility Paks will agree to Sov withdrawal 
schedule which will mandate immediate cutoff of our supply to 
Resistance, leaving Sovs free to find a pretext to stall their withdrawal.  
(Some of us on the staff are also concerned).
--He will raise Pak refusal to facilitate movement of Soviet POW's 
being held by the Resistance.  Suggest you respond we are working 
this closely to facilitate movement of SOV asylum requesters to the 
U.S., but problem has been determining eligibility- some are drug 
addicts- as well as Pak concern about public disclosures of their role in 
working with the Resistance and the U.S.  It is high on our agenda, 
however.
--Humphrey will ask the President to break relations with the Afghan 
government and pull out our embassy. [Four lines deleted, 
(b)(1)(TS/CW) exemption]
--Humphrey will also recommend the President name one high level 
coordinator to be the "Afghan Czar" for the U.S. govt.  The Senator 
has long felt a senior White House appointment is necessary to pull the 
entire U.S. govt along in tandem in order to reach our policy 
objectives.
These T.P.s have been coordinated with Ron Sable.

NOTE FROM: JAMES R. STARK
SUBJECT: "Concessions" on Saudi arms
Rod mentioned that you were not optimistic on the Saudis accepting 
the conditions Congress might require on some Presidential 
certification on Saudi arms.  For the past several weeks, Sen Warner 
bas been circulating a possible proposal which would have the 
President certify that the Saudis promise to use the missiles for 
defensive purposes only and not to transfer them to third parties 
without our permission.  (There may be other conditions, but these are 
the most important).  If Congress were to make such a proposal, our 
job would be much simpler, since the Saudis have to agree to precisely 
these conditions every LOA they sign for the weapons.  This makes a 
great figleaf for those Senators looking for an acceptable cover to 
change their vote.
  We have to be careful not to let Congress overstep itself on this.  If 
conditions linking the sale to progress in the Arab- Israeli peace 
process were inserted (such as direct negotiations), the Saudis would 
back out.
   Our problem is that, in spite of Warner's efforts, the response has 
been underwhelming.  But it remains a good idea if we can exercise 
some indirect control over the wording of the certification 
requirement.

Jim Miller - GRH decision expected today, said Gramm had a fix (to 
make Comptroller General subject to Presidential dismissal for cause). 
Wallison said it would not work - Justice felt was insufficient. 
Miller/Wallison to further coordinate.

 - DTR asked Miller to coordinate with you on issue how to deal with 
Cap in controlling 86 outlays. Jim had said 86 outlays ahead of 85 and 
should simpl y admit this would be case for DOD for both 86 and 87. 
Discussion aros e because latest monthly deficit figure ($39 Bil) is 
ahead of last year, due, Miller said to increased farm and DOD outlays 
and lowered receipts.

Much interest in President's remarks at 7/3 - 4 ceremonies - DTR 
wants them "memorable." (They aren't to that point yet.)

ODSM: Ed covered NYT/WP stories on US South Africa policy, noted 
we had guidance in place. Recommendation was for no comment on 
the Les Gelb story on INF offer in Gorbachev letter since it was so 
wide of the mark.

KS referenced story from S.B. about possible private funding for 4th 
orbiter. (This was raised as DOM as "nothing new" - DTR agreed.)

TC asked about exchange of messages with Shultz over attendance at 
Waldheim inagural & told him GPS reply in and forwarded to you. 
Lavin told him DTR did not oppose invitation to Vranitsky in 87 
(confirmed this with Dawson who said DTR? would have 
recommendation for timing with NSC).

DTR reported Soviets "did everything possible" to give positive tone to 
US/USSR discussions in Stockholm on Middle East, e.g., followed US 
suggested agenda, were not contentious. Believed attitude due to 
possible Summit more than a new approach to M.E., though Sovs 
showed some indication of flexibility. Re[?]port to follow.

Don Gregg reported good trip to ME to prepare for VP trip 7/26 - 8/4. 
Israeli [?]tra-religious/secular dispute serious: [Deleted, (b)(1)(s) 
exemption] Egypt - needs ambo, affairs drifting, Sofaer back for

[word illegible] referred to EPC today on textiles and textile 
negotiations. Plan is to get Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea to hold 
exports to US to no growth - HK and Taiwan on board, have to work 
on Koreans. Said US/EC tariff dispute resulting from EC enlargement 
still likely to be resolved - Alan Woods back today from meeting over 
weekend in Europe - anything new will report.

NOTE: Don Jones called yesterday, saying that Casey told Weinberger 
that Nitze had a copy of the proposal. Told him there had been no

Saturday, that you would talk with Cap before normal distribution

Bank). There will be pressure to commit to a U.S. pledge. While such 
a pledge could be made within Treasury's out-year budget planning 
ceilings included in the FY87 Budget, recent congressional cuts make 
those ceilings unrealistic.

State is preparing Shultz to ask Baker--probablt at next Tuesday's 
economic breakfast--to avoid an IDA pledge until the Administration's 
budget priorities can be agreed upon based on work of the newly 
created SIG. I told State staff that I thought you would support that 
position.

Subject: Meeting With SSCI
FYI - relates to question of Nicaragua finding and issue of how SSCI 
can deal with CIA role in getting the $1000 mil to contras while 
giving SFRC its proper role. More interesting question concerns VMC 
insistence that OLN not attend the meeting chaired by RKS this 
afternoon at 3 p.m. with SSCI staffer. Look for more newspaper 
articles.

NOTE FROM: OLIVER NORTH
Subject: President Azcona
A Presidential call memo has been prepared, and after much 
wrangling w/ Ray, I have concurred. [Four lines deleted, (b)(1)(3)(s) 
exemption] Subsequent to the Alvarez ouster, Bueso was assigned as 
MilAttache in Chile and at one point last year was invited to meet w/ a 
group of disgruntled Hondurans who it turns out were plotting the 
assasination of Pres. Suazo. When the FBI broke the case, Bueso was 
indicted for conspiracy. His legal advice was apparently to keep his 
mouth shut and everything wd be worked out. Although subpoenas 
were prepared for Gorman, Clarridge, Negroponte and North, they 
were never issued because Bueso pleaded guilty (on advice of counsel). 
Several months ago Azcona wrote to the President, and was never 
answered. He now is going to call the President to ask if Bueso can be 
pardoned. Bueso is due to report to Tallahase [?] to start serving 
sentence on Sep 25. He apparently still believed up until yesterday that 
he wd be going to the minimum security facility at Eglin for a short 
period (days or weeks) and then walk free. Bueso's wife has implored 
Azcona to do something and he now wants an answer to his letter, but 
we (USG) should have answered same some time ago. [Three lines 
deleted, (b)(1)(3)(s) exemption] Gorman, Clarridge, Revell, Trott and 
Abrams will cabal quietly in the morning to look at options: pardon, 
clemency, deportation, reduced sentence. Objective is to keep Bueso 
from feeling like he was lied to in legal process [Deleted, (b)(1)(s) 
exemption] will advise.

NOTE FROM: Peter Rodman
SUBJECT: Ambassador to Pakistan
  Mike Armacost called my attention to today's Washington Times 
article about right-wing attacks on Arnie Raphel, who is close to being 
nominated for Ambassador to Pakistan. Apparently, Senators Helms 
and Humphrey are collecting signatures to block the nomination. The 
grounds for the opposition to Raphel are that he is allegedly anti-Zia, 
pro-Soviet, and ready to sell out the Afghan freedom-fighters. This has 
all the earmarks of a Mike Pillsbury operation.
  I have known Arnie for a long time and these charges are a gross 
distortion. I hope you and John will hold the line in support of Arnie's 
nomination. Those of us here who have worked with him know that 
NEA, like every bureau, is susceptible to clientitis; NEA has 
sometimes dragged its feet in helping the Afghans out of excessive 
deference to the Paks. (Thus it's contradictory to accuse him of being 
anti-Pak at the same time!)
  In fact, Arnie is one of the better Foreign Service officers. He is smart 
and shrewd, with good political instincts; he is also politically savvy 
enough to be responsive to White House direction. [One line deleted, 
(b)(6) exemption]

SUBJECT: UPDATE--READ BEFORE 7:30 MEETING
Meeting with Lott, Kemp, Michel lasted for one hour.  JMP gave a 
lengthy description on the rationale/events etc.  There was not enough 
in the way of Q and A's -- but that in large part was due to Kemp 
being there -- and trying to monopolize the questioning.  It was 
unfortunate because Lott and Michel lost the opportunity to ask their 
questions and JMP lost the opportunity to hear what they had to say. 
But both Trent and Bob realize that it was their doing that they invited 
Kemp.  So no hard feelings, they were thankful that we so quickly 
pulled a meeting together.

One thing that must be clarified with JMP though.  He expressed in 
the meeting that both Shultz and he had agreed to breakfast meetings 
with the HFAC and then proceeded to say that he hoped these 
breakfasts would make it clear to the committee that a open hearing 
was not necessary.  I tried to correct him but it passed too quickly.  I 
followed up with Paul afterwards who said that he thinks JMP is clear 
on the hearing for the 10th.  I suggest you raise it though--because we 
have certainly committed ourselves to this hearing. I'm not as 
convinced as Paul is that JMP understands the nature of our "deal".

Also, State (Louise signature) sent a response to Hamilton/Fascell 
letter today.  Boyer/Berry hoped that the response would definitely put 
to bed any further discussions on the Hamilton hearing on Monday.  
But Hamilton's staffer--VanDusen--returned to town today and is 
pissed that the full committee is trying to pull the hearing away from 
them.  Hamilton did return to town tonight and VanDusen is 
scheduled to meet with him early tomorrow morning -- and will make 
a strong pitch to proceed with the hearing.  After discussion with 
Berry (who says Boyer off the record agrees), Puck[?], Thompson -- all 
think that it would be a good idea for JMP to call Hamilton FIRST 
THING Thursday morning--welcome him back, give him a little info, 
ask him to give JMP and administration opportunity to present info to 
Intell Committee, and at a minimum delay his decision on the 
subcommittee hearing til after the Friday sessions. Hopefully JMP 
would be able to convince him to not hold the subcommittee hearing at 
all -- and let it be handled by the fullcommittee, with appropriate 
principles, on Dec 10.  I did not raise it with JMP this evening because 
of the press conference but am leaving it to you to raise at the 7:30.
SO--ASK JMP TO CALL HAMILTON FIRST THING AFTER THE 
7:30.

Also, Michel raised the issue of Central America as he was walking 
out of the room.  Said to JMP that we may have problems as soon as 
congress returns.  JMP didn't know what he was talking about and 
asked Paul to check with us.  Again, due to the press of events tonight, 
Paul asked that we clarify with JMP at the 7:30.  Michel was referring 
to the possibility that the House will move a resoltuion as soon as they 
return calling for a separate affirmative vote before the next tranch of 
funds is released. (Again, the importance of making sure that our 
coalition is happy with our plans for regional democracies assistance 
with effect how this goes.)

The Casey meeting has bee set up for 1:30.  Apparently Meese's #2 
will also be attendence but I do not know who else will be included.

   Also, FYI the Aspin hearing schedule for his panel is as follows:
   11/21 Friday--Perle,
   11/24 Monday--Adelman--tentatively scheduled. Apparently 
Adelman offered to appear in a conversation he had with Aspin. Aspin 
(Finch) called Eileen to see about the scheduling. Eileen came to us. 
So Adelman does not know that Monday is the potential date. Raised it 
at staff meeting -- but JMP was not there           -- Lint, Sven seem to 
think that it is probably to our advantage to have Adelman go--he can 
answer questions raised on Friday in Perle hearing (if the answers 
need readdressing) and may buffer the next day's hearing --             
which is
   11/25 Tuesday--Crowe
   12/1 Monday--Nitze scheduled 
JMP is NOT aware of this hearing schedule. You may want to raise it 
with him. Lint and Sven are arranging for Perle and Adelman to meet 
with Linhard when he returns -- and before they testify. We need to 
close the loop with Eileen. I can do that when I come in. But felt that 
JMP should be apprised before we move any further.

these are the highlights. See you in a while

NOTE FROM: LINTON BROOKS
SUBJECT: Possible JMP Speech on Not Anticipating Arms Control
In the pre brief for last week's MX session with the President, JMP 
asked if we should give a speech on the importance of not anticipating 
arms control progress. Idea would be to defuse any suggestion that we 
can stop funding new ballistic missiles because they are going to be 
banned. Most present thought the idea was good.
   I told Bob Linhard I'd take this one for action. My view is that we 
should aim at shortly after the Congress reconvenes; that's our real 
audience. I would assume we'd want something within a week or two 
after the initial round of testimony by SecDef. waiting until then also 
lets the current Iran flap subside a bit.
     For Paul: Are there any high vis opportunities in that time frame 
that you would especially want to grab? JMP doesn't speak that often 
so we may as wellaim at getting max impact.
      For Ron: Am I right on the timing from your viewpoint?
      If we are in agreement, I'll put something together over the next 
few weeks for JMP to consider.

NOTE FROM: Alison B. Fortier
Subject: Arms sales
One outcome of Schultz meeting with SEnators:  most unaware of 
Javits report. State-H believes Javits report will help buttress our case 
that we're not going to go hog wild on arms sales. Therefore, Schultz 
will reconvene with the "Dole Group" after the recess to go over the 
Javits report; State will thus wait to send it to Hill until end of 
recess/Feb. 17.  Also, no prenotifications will go up until after recess.  
Blackhawks may be less of a problem than Bell helicopters.

I talked to Will Taft and he is receptive to Godwin attending. He want

Dave Packard view of what should have been in the Packard 
Commission report.

SUBJECT: JAVITS REPORT #2
Dennis, please look at my note to Bob Dean.  Do you agree?  I guess I 
thought that we had agreed to brief at least somewhat as the report 
went to the Hill.  You can at least offer to brief sympathetic (to the 
Admin) staff today.  We run into the same problems with briefings as 
we do with the report itself related to the Shamir visit.  You don't want 
to brief some Members on upcoming arms sales and then see them 
stand up at a HFAC coffee and ask PM Shamir what he thinks about 
Blackhawks for Saudi Arabia.  It's my assumption that unless we alert 
Hill and brief on contents of Javits report, it will take a while for Hill 
to realize it's up there.

             Economlc Policy Breakfast, March 16
         
         (This inforamtion may not be shared outside the NSC.)
         
Trade Legislation
-----------------    
There were expressions of concern about the direction and 
management of trade legislative package.  Subcommmittee bill is 
likely to be the most favorable version, Committee bill and final House 
bill likely to be worse due to Rostenkowski/Wright power struggle.  
Whitehead expressed particular concern about elements of bill 
removing Presidential discretion in trade decisions and suggested 
Administration make known its displeasure and its intent to veto 
same.  Baker mentioned EPC meeting today to shape strategy; asked 
whether White House was managing the LSG process (which it is not 
due to transition).  Suggested Secretary of State and FCC become 
involved in process and attend EPC meeting today to make views 
known about direction of bill and particularly of transfer of 
Presidentlal discretion.  It was mentioned that having USTR solo-
manage that portion of bill was like fox in chicken coop since USTR 
was chief beneflciary.  Darman called for strong Senate strategy lining 
up coalitions and votes.  FCC offered to have the President mention 
the transfer question at this week's leadership meeting but there was 
some feeling that the time was not yet ripe for that level of activity.  
FCC did ask that SID prepare talking points so that the President 
would be prepared to respond to questions at this week's proposed 
press conference.

         Bermuda Tax Treaty
   
Question raised as to results of last Friday's PRG on Bermuda.
         
We reported on some progress and a commitment to move forward on 
both the tax treaty and on the technical amendments.  Darman 
reported that Mentz' instructions were to move very cautiously; that it 
would be most difficult to alter the excise tax provision because of its 
effect upon Barbados.  Giving Bermuda parity with Barbados means 
adding tax relief for Bermuda or taking away from Barbados.  
Rostenkowski fancies that the House of Representatives should have a 
say in the Constitutional process of advising and consenting on 
treaties.  Darman felt that anything that helped Bermuda would hurt 
Barbados.
         
Italians (G-5/G-7)
         
Italy will appear at the G-7 meeting In Washington during the 
IMF/IBRD Interim session in April.  Problem is still sticky with 
Italians now asking that G-5 and G-7 always meet at separate times.

Subject: Saudi arms sales
The language probably is cleared--before I left Doug Blumenthal of 
AIPAC said Metzenbaum had asked him to get together with me on 
language on the F-15; I made some changes on it, showed it to 
Colinand he approved it.  I haven't seen what they are using, but 
presume it is what Doug and I had talked about.  Also, we got these 
silly and simple-minded letters from State to send to Cranston et al on 
the Saudi arms package; I see no reason to send them at least in their 
present form.  Have you seen them and do you think that such letters 
are needed at this point?
         
PS I didn't give away the store in Moscow, although I think Karen 
bought it.

They will remove more of my mother's insides today.<br>
Soon there will be nothing left where I come from,<br>
anywhere I face will be the future.<br>
I am traveling with my son,<br>
swimming at motel pools,<br>
meaning to talk to him today about his body.<br>
It was the Fifties.  My parents wanted me to be<br>
normal, which meant strangely without ego.<br>
And, you see, I have turned inward<br>
to this transparent life.<br>
They were right.  I will not miss<br>
any of the generic pleasures, the first of which<br>
is knowing where I stand: here, now,<br>
between the building up & the tearing down.<br>

You think it's manners<br>
that keeps my dog in the yard,<br>
but it's fear & electronics.<br>
And habit the few times<br>
we let her out without first<br>
applying her spiked collar.<br>
But habits - good ones-<br>
will not stand for long<br>
without a threat of reprisal.<br>
When the battery runs low<br>
my dog is loose in the <br>
neighborhood, taunting others<br>
to charge at full speed, then stop<br>
as if before a glass wall.<br>
An animal requires discipline.<br>
What my dog likes is <br>
stalking the edge, setting <br>
her collar beeping & all<br>
the other dogs barking.<br>
If she were human,<br>
it'd be a ledge & they'd<br>
be screaming: "Jump!"<br><P>

What prepared me for my career was not<br>
anything I read, no school I attended,<br>
no course I took, though I attended<br>
schools, took courses, read books.<br>
Moreover, it was certainly nothing<br>
I did in life, no job I held, no one experience,<br>
no love I had. It was, I believe, hanging out,<br>
sitting on the hood of a big car,<br>
leaning back against the windshield<br>
in some parking lot, looking for girls<br>
likely at the outset, or, secondarily, drink<br>
or drugs or action of any sort, but soon<br>
getting caught up in the process,<br>
dismissing these things the way a poem does<br>
its content, waving it away<br>
the way a gentle person does a fly.<br>

<BR>

   Ancient Rome, where Julius Caesar agonized, "You too,  Brutus," and where Cicero declared, "While there's life, there's hope," is  about to be reborn in cyberspace.
 

<P></P>

Tufts University scholars, who already have created what is widely  considered the most comprehensive database on ancient Greece, are ready  to tackle first-century Rome.
 

<P></P>

As one of a handful of recipients of a new National Endowment for the  Humanities grant slated for projects that use technology to teach, a  Tufts classics professor and a colleague at the College of the Holy Cross  will be able to expand on a vision described by Cicero two thousand years  ago: "History ... illuminates reality, vitalizes memory, provides guidance  in daily life and brings us tidings of antiquity."
 

<P></P>

Through the newest database, which will be available to the public  through the Internet as well as on CD-ROM, Gregory Crane, associate  professor of classics at Tufts, expects to bring Roman history to life for  those interested in Latin, ancient history and art, including the 180,000  American high school students who study Latin. 
 

<P></P>

He also expects a wide variety of armchair historians to visit the web  site. The research team's existing <B>Perseus</B> site, which chronicles ancient  Greece, logs 30,000 hits a day. Named after the mythological hero who  explored the limits of the known world, Perseus lets people quickly and  easily explore ancient Greek literature, history, art and archeology. (You  can find Perseus at <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/">www.perseus.tufts.edu</A>). The Roman Perseus will  continue a long-standing collaboration with archaeologist Neel Smith of 
the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass.
 A reference, research and teaching tool,<B> Perseus </B>also is available on  CD-ROM. It includes an overview of fifth-century B.C. history, archaic and  classical works in Greek and in translation, including the complete works  of Homer, Sophocles and others; interactive maps of Greece, still  photography and video of sites and scenes throughout Greece and a  catalog of hundreds of objects of Greek art, illustrated with color  images and drawings. Version 2.0 of the CD-ROM Perseus, as well as the 
Roman Perseus, runs on Macintosh.


<P></P>

 Perseus is widely accepted as the biggest and most complex database  on Greek civilization. The Roman Perseus is expected to do the same for  ancient Rome. 


<P></P>

 In Crane's view, databases such as these are the future of the  communications revolution, in which everyone will have equal access to  information."This is a big step forward in creating a real digital library  that will greatly expand the democratization begun by inexpensive print  distribution," he said.


<P></P>

 "Parents who are wondering what the Internet really holds for their  kids will see that web access through their schools or at home will  provide them with something of value."
 

<P></P>

Crane said that the team's immediate goal in this massive, long-term  project is to provide materials that will help students contextualize  first-century B.C. history and authors such as Cicero, Virgil, Horace and  Ovid in Latin as well as in English translation. The works of many of  these authors form the basis for 20th-century literature and  entertainment.
 

<P></P>

The first stage of the project is expected to take three years to  complete.


<P></P>

 The final version of Roman Perseus will include:
 <!-- List Tag --><UL>
<LI> Virtual, interactive guided tours and "fly-throughs" to introduce users  to the art, history, literature, architecture and daily life of the  first-century B.C.
<LI>  A wealth of images of Roman art and archeology, collected on a  digital camera from sources around the world.
<LI>  An atlas of the Roman world, including names of important places in  the Roman world, site plans and elevation models.
<LI>  Essays and course materials on Roman history and literature. Authors  will provide a general overview of subject matter that can be used by  younger students as well as detailed discussions for advanced students.
<LI>  A Latin lexicon.
</UL>
 The site also will include a worthy search engine allowing students, professors or general  users to explore the huge text database and perform research.

  Cats are the most curious of sentient beings, who mostly care not a whit what we might think of them. Hence, they make the most excellent of advisors, even when answering our most dire of questions - as dear Kitty does this January.  Have a question?

<font size=+3>q.</font>What's the best way to not get cramps?<br>
<font size=+3>a.</font> I have found that pregnancy is a sure-fire, although admittedly temporary, method of avoiding menstrual cramps. I still get some pretty nasty leg and foot cramps, but a massage and a little extra potassium usually helps take care of those. <br><br>

<font size=+3>q.</font> Should I bus Downtown on a stinky polluting bus that carries four people, or car pool with five people?<br>

<font size=+3>a.</font>
I don't like to pore over statistics that speak to the environmental impact of carpooling versus bus-riding, but a friend of mine who's into such things tells me the reduction in pollution <i>per passenger mile</i> that results from switching from car travel to motorbus travel is dramatic: 90 percent reduction in hydrocarbons, 75 percent reduction in carbon monoxide, and 10-15 percent reduction in nitrogen oxide. And I won't even get into the danger of automobile versus motorbus travel (.85 deaths/100 million passenger miles for cars; .01 deaths /100 million passenger miles for motorbusses). <br>I assume, however, that you would like me to let you know what I think is the better choice regarding your apparent commuting dilemma. Perhaps I can help clarify your thinking by treating the subject on two different levels: aesthetics and community.<br>
<p>
<center><b>1. Aesthetics.</b></center> 
<p>
Personally I would rather hop on a bus (empty or full), and be at leisure to read, think, stare out the window, people-watch, or vegetate, than be crammed into a car with four other people and forced to be social on my way to work. Maybe it's just me, but I appreciate a little transition time from home to work and back again. There's a certain beauty in letting a relative stranger chauffeur me to and from work, a person who asks nothing of me except that I pay my fare and not be a nuisance. The windows are nice and big, so I can actually see out and notice the seasons and the architectural details of buildings I would undoubtedly miss of I were stuck in a car.<br>
<p>
<center><b>2. Community.</b></center>
<p>	
<IMG SRC="pubtrans.gif" hspace=10 vspace=10 WIDTH="59" HEIGHT="135" BORDER=0 ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0">
O.K. So maybe you are one of the very rare people who might enjoy the "camaraderie" of four other people in a tight space before and after a stressful 
day. Maybe you like waiting for that one person who's continually late, and being able to personalize your rage. Based on my unscientific observations of cars on the road, you are rare indeed. Most cars boast only one occupant, the driver. I know it's hard, but you can't just think of yourself when considering issues such as this one. One bus, when full, replaces approximately forty cars. Forty cars. Or eight cars with five passengers each (dream on). So if not only you, but all your commuting friends would hop on the bus, very few busses would carry only four people during rush hour. And as demand for bus service increased, bus service would improve, road conditions would improve, fewer tax dollars would be needed to build and maintain roads, and maybe we could manage to get some decent schools for our kids. And if you live in a walkable community, you can lose the <i>stinky, polluting car</i> altogether and take a few trips to Europe every year on the money you save. <br><br>

<font size=+3>q.</font> Are you really a kid?<br>
<font size=+3>a.</font>According to my parents, yes. Maybe when I get a real job.... <br><br>

<font size=+3>q.</font> Does the election's outcome portend good or ill for the country?</b><br>
<font size=+3>a.</font> As Americans we tend to forget that the fact that we <i>have</i> elections portends good for the country. Call me a cock-eyed optimist, but I'm pretty glad to live in a place where I don't have to worry about the threat of a violent overthrow of the government every time someone has the urge to rule.  Admittedly, sometimes I feel pretty disgusted with the nature of how elections are conducted in this country, but generally I'm glad I don't have to carry a gun to make a point. <br><br>
<font size=+3>q.</font> My cats eat too fast and then puke. What can I do to change that??? They are both pretty fat even with the binge and purge, binge and purge....</b><br>
<font size=+3>a.</font>Maybe your home life is upsetting to your kitties. Cats are sensitive creatures with highly developed empathetic powers. Are you happy as an individual? Are you satisfied with your intra-human relationships? Is your job going O.K.? You owe it to your cats to shape up! Poor things are probably worried sick about you. Self actualize! Your cats will stop this gastrointestinal editorializing soon enough.

<h3>donald hall on 'The Old Life'</h3><P>

<b>by nicholas a. basbanes</b>

<P>


<br clear=all>

<hr width=80%>



<blockquote>




   Writing at the highest levels of accomplishment has sometimes been described as a daunting process of finding excruciatingly precise words to fit unusually demanding situations.
   

<P></P>
<img width=160 height=190 hspace=10 align=right src= lex.jpg>
Donald Hall - a  man of letters whose passion for seemingly endless revision is legendary - not only agrees with that premise, but goes further when he is writing poetry to consider cadence, structure, and nuance, even the specific number of syllables that will appear in every line of verse. 
  

<P></P>

 As the calendar continues its inexorable countdown to the next millennium, and as increasingly powerful computers usher in what has been celebrated as the  information age, "it is instructive to examine the labors of a consummate craftsman who typically spends four or five years working on individual poems for no reason other than "getting the words right and in the proper order."
   

<P></P>

 The thought of producing a completed work in the first attempt is almost laughable for Hall, whose latest collection of four highly personal poems, <I>The Old Life</I> (Houghton Mifflin, 134 pp., $19.95), is a perfect case in point. 
  

<P></P>

 The longest poem in the book, the title poem, is a 96-page narrative that embraces the full sweep of Hall's life, from his earliest memories growing up as a child some 55 years ago, to the death last year from leukemia of Jane Kenyon, his wife of 23
years, and also a poet of considerable renown. 
  

<P></P>

 Read in a single sweep, the title poem offers what amounts to an autobiography in verse, a memoir of eventful times recalled with enviable economy of language. A close examination shows that there are 15 syllables in every two lines of the poem, an unusual construction that Hall imposed upon himself  "simply because I like the shapes I could make with it, and because it pleased me," he said during a recent interview.
  

<P></P>

  "I don't expect anybody to ever notice this, which is why I took special pains to disguise it," he explained. "Generally, when you're working with syllables in poetry, you do it with each line, but here I took every two lines, and allowed myself to
split them up at any point. So sometimes there may be lines of sevens and eights, other times there may be tens and fives - but they always add up to fifteen for every two lines."
   

<P></P>

Hall said that the benefit of imposing such a rigid structure on himself is that it "helps the creative process"by making him be inventive within the guidelines he has established.
  

<P></P>

 "Part of the process of revision is to force you to think over every single word. So a form like that, which basically is a constraint, actually becomes a liberation, because it requires you to think every word through until every one is perfect."
  

<P></P>

 This poem, like virtually every other poem he has written over the past 40 years, was deemed publishable only after he had produced scores of drafts. 
  

<P></P>

 "I write in longhand, and I have a typist who types up fresh versions for me every day. People say to me, 'How do you know when a poem is done?' I tell them, 'Well, I don't.' Because after a book comes out, I begin to make changes in the margins."
  

<P></P>

 During the 1950s, Hall was poetry editor of the <I>Paris Review</I>, editing numerous anthologies that showcased the work of younger poets. A graduate of Harvard College and Oxford University, he taught at the University of Michigan for 20 years before moving into his ancestral farm at Eagle Pond in New Hampshire with Jane
Kenyon, his second wife. 
  

<P></P>

 In addition to the 12 volumes of poetry he has published over the past 41 years, Hall has written many essays on subjects ranging from baseball to the sculptor Henry Moore. He also is the author of numerous children's books, including the hugely
successful <I>Ox-Cart Man</I>, a story of New England farm life and winner of a Caldecott Medal in 1980.
 

<P></P>

  Now 68, Hall has survived several frightful encounters with  cancer. In January of 1994, Jane Kenyon, his wife and 19 years his junior, was diagnosed with leukemia. A good deal of  <I>The Old Life</I>, deals with grief, particularly the eight-stanza poem,
<I>Without</I>, which is entirely devoid of capital letters and punctuation, and concludes the volume; it deals frankly with disease and the ominous prospect of imminent loss. 
 

<P></P>

  "It's not an especially hopeful poem," Hall agreed. "It is a poem written out of illness, not out of death. It is about how it was to live with this disease for 15 months. I began it about  six months into the disease. I'd never written a poem before that
was so asyntactical and unpunctuated, but that was what I wanted at the time. It is a poem that came out of thoughts."
    

<P></P>

As a rule, Hall continued, poems do not emerge from his considered thoughts, but more subconsciously from a variety of subtle sources, seemingly forgotten experiences among them. 
 

<P></P>

  "That year was without seasons, without compartments, without divisions, and then I thought, without punctuation, and that of course brought me to the poem. That one probably went 80 or 90 drafts, something like that, and I read it to Jane several times
along the way."
  

<P></P>

 Since Kenyon's death, Hall said he has "done nothing but write poems about her," and has begun writing her "letters in verse, telling her what's happening, remembering things." Some of the letters, he added, have gone through 120 drafts, and that he will continue revising until he feels they are ready for publication.
   

<P></P>

"I do this because I want to write a beautiful thing that will last forever," he said. "I'm not telling you that I believe I will do that, but that's what I want to accomplish. A
beautiful thing that will last forever is directed outward. It comes from you but it goes elsewhere."

</ul>
<b>george jr.</b> is a "spiffy e-zine" that "spares no irony when it comes to subject matter ranging from the mineral hardness of American leaders (diamond: 10; Perot: 9) all the way to how your senator voted ('Sure. Yes. Undoubtedly. Whatever.') The site is pretty interesting, and offers a link to recently declassified White House e-mail, which is always full of tawdry little secrets." - Netsurfer Digest, April 30, 1996</a>

<P></P><i>Je suis scandalise! </i>We are shocked to learn that Mary Engelbreit, the illustrator of dainty children clutching flowers, has launched a new magazine called <b>Mary Engelbreit's Home Companion</b> - in plain defiance of  the Prairie Home Companion empire, and other publications that use the word 'Home' bolder than a mastif on the plains of Ohio.
<P></P> Has this Engelbreit woman no idea of the trouble she'll fall into? And that superpowers are buying up, left and right, phrases such as "left and right," not no mention vowels, consonants and several gutteral sounds that heretofore were common to many of us?</a>

<H3>Techies/White House E-mail link</H3>
<blockquote>
The White House refused to provide any of the e-mail in electronic
form. Rather, White House and other government staff printed out
the specific e-mail messages targetted by the National Security
Archive's Freedom of Information Act requests, then reviewed the
printouts for classified information and privacy issues before
releasing them in hard copy form.
<P>
Ian Stevenson then employed a Hewlett Packard ScanJet IIc/ADF
scanner, together with CAERE optical character recognition
software, to digitize the large stack of White House printouts
selected for this disk. The typographical errors, run-on
sentences, bad grammar, colloquial language and other questionable
matters found here are all exactly as they appear in the originals
-- nothing was corrected or bowdlerized for this disk. The layouts
are as close to the originals as humanly possible, including the
classification markings.

<H3>White House E-mail  CHRONOLOGY</H3>
<blockquote>


<B>1982</B> - The National Security Council (NSC) staff at the White House acquires a prototype electronic mail system, from IBM, called the Professional Office
System (PROFs).
<P>
<B>April 1985 </B>- The PROFs e-mail system becomes fully operational within the NSC,
including not only the full staff, but also home terminals for the National
Security Adviser, Robert "Bud" McFarlane, and his deputy, Admiral John M.
Poindexter.
<P>
<B>december 1986</B> - The remainder of the White House comes on line with
electronic mail, at first with the PROFs system, and later (by the end of the 1980s) through a variety of systems including VAX A-1 ("All in One"), and ccmail.
<P>
<B>december 22-25, 1986</B> - John Poindexter and Oliver North electronically shred
more than 5000 e-mail notes in the memory banks of their computer systems, as the
Iran-contra scandal breaks.
<P>
<B>december 28, 1986</B> - Career staff at the White House Communications Agency
order the december backup tapes of the e-mail system to be saved instead of recycled as usual. Subsequently, investigators from the FBI and the Tower Commission use
the backup takes to reconstruct the Iran-contra scandal.
<P>
 - The Tower Commission issues its report on Iran-contra,
reprinting hundreds of PROFs notes exchanged by McFarlane, Poindexter and
North.
<P>
<B>January 19, 1989</B> - On the last day of the Reagan presidency, the National
Security Archive files a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests
together with a lawsuit against President Ronald Reagan, to prevent the imminent
erasure of the White House electronic mail backup tapes. At 6:10 pm, on the eve
of George Bush's inauguration, U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker issues a
Temporary Restraining Order, prohibiting the destruction of the backup tapes to
the PROFs system.
<P>
<B>September 15, 1989</B> - U.S. District Judge Charles B. Richey rules that the
National Security Archive and its co-plaintiffs, including the American
Historical Association (AHA) and the American Library Association (ALA), have
standing to sue President Bush, in order to force him to comply with the
retention requirements of various records acts which potentially cover the White
House e-mail.
<P>
<B>January 25, 1991</B> - After a year-and-a-half of legal procedural wrangling, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upholds Judge Richey's
ruling on standing, denying the Bush administration's attempts to have the case
dismissed.
<P>
<B>december 20, 1992</B> - On request from the plaintiffs, Judge Richey adds the White House e-mail from the lame-duck Bush administration to the case, issuing a
restraining order preventing the Bush White House from destroying its own
backup computer records.
<P>
<B>January 6, 1993</B> - Judge Richey rules that computer tapes containing copies of
e-mail messages by Reagan and Bush White House staff must be preserved like
other government records, because the electronic versions are not simply duplicates of
paper printouts, but contain additional information beyond the paper copies.
<P>
<B>January 11 and 14, 1993</B> - Judge Richey issues specific court orders requiring
that the Bush White House preserve its computer records. In press interviews,
Judge Richey says that despite his orders, he believes that the Bush
administration is planning to destroy its e-mail files.
<P>
<B>January 15, 1993</B> - In an expedited emergency ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit upholds and modifies the rulings by Judge
Richey, holding that government officials could erase White House and NSC
computer files, as long as they preserved, on backup tapes, identical copies of
what was being erased.
<P>
<B>January 19, 1993</B> - President Bush signs a secret agreement with Don Wilson,
head of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), purporting to
grant Bush exclusive legal control over the e-mail tapes of his administration. 
Working through the night, a staff team from NARA takes custody of thousands
of tapes and disk drives, hurriedly removing them from White House offices to
prevent incoming Clinton appointees from gaining access to them.
<P>
<B>February 16, 1993</B> - NARA career staff who managed the transfer describe in an internal memo how the so-called "midnight ride" had violated NARA's own rules
for records transfers and how several sets of tapes ordered preserved by Judge Richey
had been lost, erased or damaged.
<P>
<B>May 22, 1993 </B>- Judge Richey cites the Clinton White House and the acting
Archivist of the United States for contempt of court for failing to carry out his
order to issue new and appropriate guidelines for the preservation of the
computer records of the Reagan, Bush and Clinton White House staff.
<P>
<B>August 13, 1993</B> - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
vacates Judge Richey's contempt orders but upholds his overall decision that the
Federal Records Act (FRA) requires that complete electronic copies of e-mail
messages be preserved by the White House, and by extension, government
agencies in general. The appeals court remands the case to Judge Richey to decide the
issue of the dividing line between "agency" records covered by the FRA and
presidential records covered by the Presidential Records Act.
<P>
<B>March 25, 1994</B> - In a brief filed in federal court, the Clinton administration
declares that the National Security Council is not an agency, and should be
accorded the protection from public scrutiny given to the President's personal
advisers. This argument attempts to remove the Clinton administration's White
House e-mail from the reach of FOIA requests and the FRA, arguing that all its
documents are subject only to the Presidential Records Act (PRA) and therefore
not to court oversight.
<P>
<B>December 13, 1994</B> - The e-mail plaintiffs file suit against the Acting Archivist
of the United States to void the Bush-Wilson agreement, in American Historical
Association et. al. v. Peterson.
<P>
<B>February 15, 1995</B> - Judge Richey rejects the Clinton administration's arguments about the NSC's status as "arbitrary and capricious... contrary to history, past practice and the law," and declares that the National Security Council is an
agency. The government subsequently appeals the decision, and the plaintiffs
cross-appeal against a portion of Richey's ruling that opens a loophole for
senior NSC staff giving advice to the President.
<P>
<B>February 27, 1995</B> - In a separate opinion in the lawsuit over the Bush-Wilson
agreement, Judge Richey declares the agreement "null and void," writing that "No
one, not even a President, is above the law." The New York Times subsequently
editorializes, under the headline "A Special Place in History for Mr. Bush," that
"No President has the right to corner official records in an effort to control
his place in history." (March 1, 1995, page A18)
<P>
<B>September 8, 1995</B> - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit hears oral arguments in the case on the issue of Judge Richey's decision
and the agency versus Presidential status of the NSC.

<h2><center><img src="heading.jpg"><br><b>ABOUT TCCM Design</h2>
</center></b><img src="images/line.gif"><p>
TCCM Design was one of the Capital District New York's oldest web design
firms. The company was originally formed as a division of <a 
href="http://www.albany.net/~tricity/mast.html">Tri-City Computing 
Magazine</a>, when the magazine first went online in early 1994. After a 
couple of months of creating a monthly web version of our print  publication, TCCM
Design's staff began to offer their services to other businesses wanting 
to "get on the web".<p>

The company has grown quite well and continues to
expand every day. TCCM Design is no longer affiliated with Tri-City 
Computing 
Magazine and our offices are now located in the Southwestern U.S.. 
For a list of our clients please follow this link: <a 
href="biz.html">Client List</a><p>

Our staff includes web page design professionals, copy writers,
cgi, Java and Active X  programmers (for designing
those complicated forms and cool animations you might want for your site), 
graphic designers and research
consultants. All fully trained to assist you in taking your
business into the 21st century.<p>


Don't let your competition leave you standing in a cloud of their internet
marketing dust. Put your business
on what many call the greatest advertising opportunity since
television - the world wide web.<p>
Advertising on the web has the potential to reach approximately
25 million users world wide, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week<b> because 
the 
web never sleeps!</b> That's a lot of potential don't you think? 25 million 
consumers who may want to buy your product from the comfort of their own 
homes or offices.<p> Let TCCM Design help get you on the web; Linking your 
business to the world is
our business. Now and into the 21st Century, TCCM Design Web Services is 
your right choice.<p>

Here you'll find links to many helpful programs from web browsers to shareware sites. 
<P>
<h3>Web Related Sites</h3><p>

If you own an IBM PC running windows and want one heck of a collection  of
shareware/freeware for use on the 'net, this is the place to go. If you own a Mac, or have enough
Windows Internet software, I'd say move on...
<P>

<h3>Windows Sharerware and Other Helpful Programs</h3><p>
<hr>
<A HREF="http://www.shareware.com">Shareware Com</A> (from
the folks at C|Net). A very nicely laid out site, but sometimes it's quite busy.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.windows95.com/apps/nonapps.html">Windows 95 Magazine's
Non-network Shareware</A> Direct from Windows 95 magazine comes a collection of
shareware that's not (for once) related to the internet. Sorry, the files here are Win95 specific. 
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.hyperion.com/usox/index.html">The Used Software Exchange</A>
While nothing here is free, you can browse the aisles and shop for used software at incredibly low
prices. Since you're basically buying from other 'net users, you can haggle about price to your
heart's content.<p>
<a href= "http://www.computan.on.ca/~ksmith/collect.html">Collector's Showcase</a> -
Collector's Database SW</a>.<p>
<a href= "/utils/windows/WZ5a.exe">Download Winzip - Zip/Unzip Utility for Windows -
220K</a><p>
<A HREF="http://www.jumbo.com">http://www.jumbo.com</A></P>
I think this is the best shareware/freeware library in cyberspace.
Why? Jumbo's easy-to-use search tool helps you find what you need in
the nearly 50,000 files in categories such as business, education,
graphics, and games. A brief description of each file is included.
The files actually reside on servers around the world; Jumbo acts
like a giant switchboard to give you links to all the sites holding
the particular program. Select the site closest to you for the
speediest download.
<P><A HREF="http://www.windows95.com">http://www.windows95.com</A> Its selection of
freeware isn't quite as comprehensive as Jumbo's. Nevertheless, Windows95.com is worth a visit,
primarily for its innovative interface that includes Windows-style icons and a Taskbar.
<P><A HREF="http://wwwgalttech.com/index.shtml">http://wwwgalttech.com/index.shtml</A>
This site offers access to thousands of shareware programs. Like
Jumbo, it has a searchable database and lays out the programs in
various categories. It also features a top ten downl;oad section that
you can just click on and get the latest and hottest programs.
<P><A HREF="  http://www.msn.com">Microsoft</A> If you want free Microsoft software,
head to the company's Web site. The Windows software library is well organized, with a separate
section for downloading Microsoft Office macros, the Internet Explorer 2.0 and 3.0 Web
browser, utilities such as the Microsoft Word Technical Dictionary, and a self-running Microsoft
Office for Windows 95 demo. <p>
<A HREF="http://www.happypuppy.com">The Happypuppy.com</A> one of the best shareware
and software sites on the net today. Don't miss this one.<p>

<p>I've never been good at doing repairs around the house. But, with the prices for hiring service
people becoming outrageously high, I have begun to learn to do many of  the minor repairs 
needed around my house, rather than call a repair person. Because of my new found interest in
fixing things around the house, I was very interested in a new CD-ROM from Parsons
Technology.  The new <em>Black &amp; Decker Everyday Home Repairs</em>-multimedia software is packed
with helpful secrets, tips and step-by-step instructions to handle more than 100 of the
most-common home repair headaches without hassle.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Everyday Home Repairs gives you everything you need, from the start of your tasks to their
completion, for repairing windows, doors, walls and ceilings; handling basic plumbing and
electrical chores; repairing and maintaining floors; and making exterior home repairs. By using the
program you will have the ability to learn how to fix over 100 common household repairs.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The program begins with a very brief audiovisual introduction that sets the tone of what the user
can expect to find while using the software. The program is laid out into six major areas:<em>
Plumbing, Electrical, Windows and Doors, Walls and Ceiling, Floor Repair, and Exterior</em>. Once
you've clicked on your area of choice, it begins with a brief audiovisual introduction on what will
be covered. Users then choose from a list of common repairs such as fixing a leaky faucet,
replacing an electrical outlet or repairing a damaged vinyl floor.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Once the repair problem is chosen from the list, the user is greeted by an easy to understand color
photographic slide show with audio instructions that take you step-by-step through the repair
process. For instance, you can learn to repair a damaged vinyl floor in just six simple steps. The
program also insures that your repairs are done correctly by including a complete list of safety
instructions that are specific to each task. Don't just skip over these safety steps, read them. They
can be very important and also save you down time during your repair.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>One great feature of the software is the ability to print out instructions with photos (in color on
color printers), so you can have them by your side at the repair site  (because it's obvious you
won't be sitting in front of the computer while fixing a toilet float right?). You can also print out a
list of tools and materials needed for the project. This will help a great deal when you're
wandering around aimlessly in one of those big home repair warehouses. You'll also be able to
obtain a time estimate on the project (depending on your level of expertise) and a cost estimate.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>There are two very nice glossaries, one for tools and the other on materials. Each is setup in
alphabetical order. By clicking on a given letter you get a list of tools or materials beginning with
that letter. Pick a tool or type of material and you'll be given a little summary on what the material
is or the tool does. The glossary will also help to explain any technical terms you don't
understand. In addition, there is  a list of tips for putting together the "perfect" collection of tools
for your toolbox.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>While use of this program won't prepare you for staring in an episode of ABC Television's Home
Improvement along side Tim and Al, you will be able to learn a great deal about basic repairs for
around the home. At $29 for the disk, even if you use it once or twice to fix something minor,
you'll end up saving more than the cost of the program.

<p> 

<p><strong>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:</strong> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Everyday Home Repairs requires an IBM or compatible PC 486 or better system, 8MB of RAM,
a 2x CD-ROM drive, DOS 3.1 or higher, Microsoft Windows 3.1 or higher (yes, it works fine on
Windows 950),  a 256-color VGA monitor, 2MB hard drive space, a sound board and speakers,
and a mouse.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Well here it is time to start thinking about the Holidays again. If the folks on your list are into
computer gaming then hopefully this collection of new games, and for the kids, some educational
programs as well, will help you choose the perfect gift. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>NEW GAMES:</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Our friends over at Activision have eleven great gift-giving games available for the holidays. Here
are reviews on the one's we liked best. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>The Elk Moon Murder:</em> This interactive CD-ROM draws you into a compelling murder mystery.
What's new about Elk Moon is that the tale takes place in the rich and diverse culture of the
American Southwest. The player races against time to solve a murder before the killer strikes
again. Written by Sam Egan, of Northern Exposure fame, the game features Amanda Donohoe of
L.A. Law. There is a lot of live action here and the production is very well done. Available for 
Mac, DOS, and Windows 95 CD, $29.95; ages 18 and up. A sequel, <em>Sacred Ground</em> is due out
soon. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Interstate 76: </em>I'm sure a great many of you have wished you had a rocket launcher mounted on
the hood of your car at one time or another while driving on the interstates. Well in this game you
do. Your job is to cruise the highways of the American Southwest as you face off against
terrorists intent on destroying the largest oil reserves in the U.S. The first-person 3-D action here
is really hot with a gripping soundtrack and great graphics. Available for Windows 95 and MS-Dos for about $49.95.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>MechWarrior 2: Mercenaries</em>: Last year Activision had one of the most successful computer
games of all-time with MechWarrior 2.  Following on the heels of that success, they've come out
with this "prequel". Players battle each other in huge Mechanized warrior robots in a quest for
money, power and fame. Gladiatorial style combat on a highly technological scale with tons of
destructive weapons that allow you to lay waste to your opponents without mercy. I thought it
was better that the original version because it's a no-holds barred slugfest with out rules or honor;
just fighting. Available for both Windows 95 and MS-Dos for $49.95. Also available for the Sony
Playstation for around $49.95.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Time Commando: </em>Activision is distributing this one but it's designed by a French company.
Seems that a computer virus has entered the tactical computers at a European military command
center. Your job as the time commando is to travel through various time periods defeating
computer created opponents (over 60 historical enemies in 9 time periods) until you are able to
finally defeat the last opponent and restore the core-memory of the main computer. The action
here is 3-D with nicely rendered backgrounds and flowing game play in a Mortal Kombat style. I
had a bit of trouble running it on a 486 but it does run well on a Pentium. I'm always a little leery
of games coming from France (maybe it's that complete crash of my system caused by Robinson's
Requiem a few years ago) but Time Commando was lots of fun to play as you master weapons
from each time period in an effort to defeat enemies and move to the next level. On CD-ROM for
Windows 95 and MS-Dos as well as Sony Playstation, for around $45.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Muppet Treasure Island:</em> What's more fun than a barrel of monkeys, why four CD-ROMs full of
Muppets, that's what! Join Kermet the Frog, Miss Piggy and actor Tim Curry in this fun-filled
adventure based on the recent Muppet movie. The interactive game play is enlivened with 20
different puzzles and activities coupled with great live-action video. Battle survey pirates and
search for fabulous treasure in the funniest adventure on CD-ROM. Available for Windows 95,
Windows 3.1 and Mac for about $39.95.
</em>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Also from Activision is <em>Blast Chamber: </em> an action-strategy game that allows up to 4 players to
challenge each other as they maneuver their character through a vast maze of obstacles ($44.95).
The race here is against time as your character has a time bomb strapped to their backs;<em> Shanghai
II:</em> a nice mah-jongg style tile game with great graphics ($19.95); <em>Hyperbalde:</em> A cross between
hockey, lacrosse and soccer, set in a future world. The game has very little rules - beat your
opponents into the ground and score goals ($49.95); <em>Zork Nemesis:</em> Travel to 5 different fantasy
worlds to unlock the secrets of the Forbidden Lands. Great graphics and sound effects make this a
nice gift for those interested in Science Fiction of Fantasy gaming ($49.95).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>7th Level has a couple of nice games out or coming out for the Holidays.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Timon &amp; Pumbaa's Jungle Games: </em>In cooperation with Disney Interactive, two funny characters
from the Lion King are brought to the PC to host five fun jungle games. There's <em>Jungle Pinball
</em>with wild jungle animals acting as bumpers and a rolled up worm as your ball; <em>Slingshooter</em>,
where you sling berries at jungle creatures; <em>Hippo Hop</em> where you must cross a river of snakes
and crocodiles to get to the other side; <em>Bug Drop </em>- a tetris style game with stink bugs and <em>Burper</em>
- where Pumbaa burps bugs into oblivion. The fun part of the whole CD-ROM is the critiques,
insults and banter from Timon and Pumbaa. The cartoon graphics are excellent and the game is
fun for kids and adults. Available for around $39.95.<em></em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>G-NOME</em> is an action combat game typical to the MechWarrior type games.  A G-NOME demo
is available to download from www.7thlevel.com.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>The Universe According to Virgil Reality: </em>This nifty little CD-ROM presents the wonders of
science in a fun environment through a combination of animation, audio and video. The wacked-out Professor Reality is your guide to this fun-filled look at science. Learn to make paper
airplanes and how they fly; view earthworm intestines and other equally gross things; view cool
space shots from NASA and lots more. ($39.99).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Tracer</em>: You're a super hacker who can crack any code, defeat any strategy/action  rogue
program, and pry open any file. Now, you're up against a virus that's bent on destroying you.
That's the premise behind Tracer, an adrenaline-pumping, addictive action game that calls on
strategy and quick reflexes in equal measure. You play as one of four characters who must race
across a grid inside a vast computer network, using square "code pads"-divided into four triangles
of various colors-to reach the "exit." All the while, you're being chased by a virus that destroys
each pad almost as soon as you place it-and if the virus catches you, you're dead. Available for     
$29.950)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Ace Ventura-CD-ROM</em> offers adventures with that funny pet detective of movie fame. As Ace
you get to battle 4 twisted, animal hating villains, solve puzzles and visit 60 exotic locations for
only $39.95. This one has excellent animation and the game play is first rate.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>7th Level has a new web site they are working on, <em>Kids' World</em>. It's located at
http://www.kidsworld.com. While still under construction, by Christmas it's supposed to be an
exciting new interactive cartoon network.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>SimPark:</em> Kids build and manage their own nature park in this easy-to-play simulation. Kids begin
by designing the park and deciding what combination of plants and animals to include and what
things to allow humans to do. As park rangers, kids are responsible for maintaining the balance
between nature and humans and overseeing budgets, garbage, fires, and maintenance. From
Maxis, Windows and Windows 95 CD, $39.99. Ages 8 to 12.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Battle of the Ironclads: </em>You get the chance to change the course of history by taking the helm of
either classic Civil War ship, the USS Monitor or the CSS Virginia. The ships, weapons, tactics,
and technology of the era have been re-created to be historically accurate and are based on
blueprints and maps from the National Archives. The decisions you make, such as how fast to sail,
when to fire cannons, and when to anchor, are all part of the strategy in this game, which will
please historians as well as strategy gamers. Grolier Interactive, 800-285-4534 or 203-797-3530;
Windows CD, $49.99 street.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Titanic:</em> Adventure Out of Time: In this adventure game, you explore a historically accurate 3-D
replica of the Titanic while trying to accomplish a mission as a secret agent aboard the luxury
liner. You must defuse bombs, send and receive Morse code, regulate the Titanic's engines, and
interact with 25 passengers to gather clues before the ship sinks. Who knows, you may even be
able to prevent World War I if you make the right choices. CyberFlix, 800-483-8632 or
423-546-1157; Mac and Windows CD, $49.95.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Starcraft:</em> In this real-time strategy game, you journey into space to restore order to a galaxy on
the brink of interstellar warfare. As commander of one of three species vying for supremacy, you
undertake a series of strategic military missions while defending planets and constellations,
employing advanced technology, and controlling reserves of finite resources. Starcraft includes
multi player support for up to eight players and one-click free access to online opponents via the
company's battle.net server. Blizzard Entertainment, 800-953-7669 or 310-793-0600; Windows
95 CD, $50.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Also from Blizzard is <em>Warcraft</em>: Set in a mythical medieval world, Warcraft II features the
continuing battle for Azeroth over land, sea, and air. As in the original version, the two sides in
the conflict are the evil Orcs and the noble human race. You can play as either race in 28
campaign scenarios. The game also includes Map Builder, which lets you create your own
scenarios.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Warcraft II plays somewhat like SimCity or Civilization, in that you must construct buildings
(such as farms, barracks, town halls, and dragon lairs) based on the resources you collect,
including lumber, gold, and oil while battling your opponents. Among the troops and weaponry in
Warcraft are elves, orcs, troll berzerkers, ogres, goblins, dragons, giant sea turtles, griffins,
zeppelins, battleships, and spell-casting death knights. You can play against human opponents via
a network, modem, or serial connection. Mac, DOS, and Windows CD, $50.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>You Don't Know Jack Volume 2 and You Don't Know Jack Sports: </em>We reviewed the first Jack last
year and the sequel is pretty good too. The second volume of You Don't Know Jack retains the
irreverent humor of the original and has just as many questions -- 800. That's good. But you also
get celebrity guest appearances, high-score lists, and all new categories of questions. The sports
version covers everything from baseball to water polo, and its host makes Howard Cosell sound
tame. Both titles are stand-alone games and support up to three players on a keyboard. Berkeley
Systems, Mac and Windows CD, $29.99.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Comanche 3</em>: This helicopter flight simulation features an improved graphics engine that brings
3-D details to landscapes and targets and makes them look more realistic. Multi player options
give you a choice of playing two-player cooperative missions through a modem or playing with up
to eight players over a network. The features on your Comanche, such as the cockpit and landing
gear, are based on the actual Army aircraft. In addition, the approximately 30 missions are linked
through a narrative story line with live-action videos, such as mission briefings and footage of
Comanche test aircraft. If you enjoy serious flight sims and war-based strategy games, check it
out. From NovaLogic, DOS, Windows, and Windows 95 CD, $44.95.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>PowerChess:</em> PowerChess takes the ancient game of strategy and makes it accessible to novices
and experts alike while giving it a bit of personality. There are 25 animated characters to play
against, all incorporating different tactics. And you can play a match against an opponent over the
Internet. The PowerChess Queen offers tutorials and analysis immediately following matches. In
addition, there's narrated analysis of seven classic chess games, including the 1970 match where
Bobby Fischer defeated Wilhem Smyslov. In the Lab, you can create a training opponent so you
can practice specific points in your game.  From Sierra On-Line, Windows 95 CD, $39.95.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter:</em> LucasArts' long-awaited space-combat simulation mixes all the elements
of the previous Star Wars games with the option for multi player action. Multi player modes allow
you to choose whether you want to fly for the Rebels or the Empire, and there is a choice of
about 12 different spacecraft. There are 15 challenging missions in which pilots communicate with
members of their squad to discuss tactics and objectives. In fact, the missions are designed to
promote cooperation among allies. Single-player mode is similar to the multi player scenarios,
though missions focus on a different set of conflicts between the Rebellion and the Empire. May
the force be with you, again. From LucasArts, Windows CD, $54.95.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Also from LucasArts, <em>Afterlife</em> lets the player run a sim-city type version of heaven and hell. Keep
your souls happy and things will go fine. If not, supernatural disasters will befall your worlds and
you'll lose souls by the bunch. One particularly harsh disaster includes a visit from the Four
Surfers of the Apocalypso. The 3-D graphics are excellent as is the game interface and playability.
I liked playing God or was it Satan. $39.95 on CD-ROM for Windows and Mac.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Space Jam:</em> Based on the soon to be released movie starring Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny,
Space Jam takes you onto the court for an intergalactic three-on-three basketball game to decide
the fate of the Looney Tunes characters. You take on the evil alien "Monstars", who are armed
with the talents of top NBA superstars. The game features special dunks and defensive moves and
bonus power-ups. Acclaim Entertainment, Windows CD, $39.99.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Not to be outdone by anyone - the folks that make your operating system, help you surf the web,
run your word processor etc, Microsoft now has a first wave of holiday '96 PC games.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Deadly Tide</em> is an underwater action shooter in which players move from mysterious sunken ships
to alien mining operations to battles on the open sea as they attempt to save humanity from the
enemy that has invaded the Earth on a mission to drown the world. The wonderful 3-D graphics
in Deadly Tide were created by the same designers responsible for the effects on the "SeaQuest"
and "Star Trek: The Next Generation" television series and movies such as "RoboCop" and "Total
Recall." And yes, it's Windows 95 compatible. $54.95.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Hellbender</em> is an intense action shooter that offers players an integrated science-fiction story line
for challenging game-play experiences. Hellbender features secret worlds, hidden objects,
numerous weapons and a variety of enemies. The game is a technological powerhouse and
provides full support for Direct3D-based gaming, multi player competition via LAN, direct
modem and the Internet (via Microsoft Internet Gaming Zone at (HTTP://WWW.ZONE.COM/),
and full freedom of movement using the SideWinder 3D Pro joystick. Voice-over is provided by
"The X-Files" star Gillian Anderson ($44.95)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Monster Truck Madness</em>, the world's only PC monster truck racing simulation, features an
extraordinarily realistic racing experience that allows gamers to feel the uninhibited power and
outrageous fun of monster trucks. Play begins with highly detailed renderings of world-famous
monster trucks including BigFoot, Snake Bite and Gravedigger. Racing courses contain realistic
obstacles and terrain rendered in detailed, textured 3-D graphics. The gunning motors and cries of
twisted metal are the real things, too, recorded and digitized from actual monster truck races. And
narrating the drive to victory is the voice of Armey Armstrong, beloved by millions of monster
truck racing fans.  Gamers can also connect to the Microsoft Monster Truck Web Stop site on the
World Wide Web http://www.microsoft.com/games/monster/  to find the no-charge Monster
Truck Madness trial version, up-to-the-minute information on monster trucks, race results and
Monster Truck Madness. Somehow I never understood the attraction to monster trucks myself
($44.95).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>NBA Full Court Press</em> is a great PC basketball game. Play head-to-head with up to four players
on one PC or across town over a modem or network. It has very true-to-life graphics, lifelike
player moves and intense, realistic five-on-five game play. NBA Full Court Press combines the
best of exciting arcade action with a sophisticated database of statistics of more than  250
motion-captured player moves - including jump shots, skyhooks, blocked shots and a variety of
creative dunks - real crowd noises, and all 29 NBA arenas captured and digitized in full detail. All
29 NBA teams are represented. $44.95.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>American Civil War:</em> This two-CD set teaches you about the tumultuous times surrounding the
Civil War. The strategy game CD includes various political and military victory scenarios, so you
face different strategic, economic, and political challenges each time you play. The multimedia CD
contains a 175,000-word narrative text, plus maps, photos, biographics, songbook, and video
clips. I ran it on a 486, 100mhz and play was slow but entertaining. I played the South and ended
up defeating the Union in under 1 year. Interactive Magic, Windows and Windows 95 CD, $36
street; ages 12 and up.
</em>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em><em>HardBall 5</em> includes a pitching and batting practice area and home-run derby to practice your
skills. You can play exhibition games; all-star games; and complete, half, and short season games
drawing on a 40-man roster, 800 Major League players, and 40 stadiums. Sportscaster Al
Michaels calls the play-by-play. The Legends League features 12 old-time stadiums, plus player
photos and stats. The 1961 Yankees, the 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers, and even the 1916 Boston Red
Sox are represented. Accolade, Windows CD, $49.95; ages 6 and up.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>The Wild World of Madison Jaxx</em>: In this interactive geographical game, players are special agents
for the Global Special Services Corporation (GSS), headquartered in New York City. Headed by
Madison Jaxx, the GSS sends agents all over the world to catch dangerous criminals, stop deadly
viruses and locate lost treasures. This one is kind of like a cross between Carmen San Diego and
Indiana Jones. From Corel (sorry don't have a price on this one).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Ashes to Ashes</em> - Devastated by decades of brutal warfare, earth's future is not pretty. The Order
was created to preserve the art of war while preventing  mass destruction. Under the Order's
control all disputes - personal, corporate, political - are settled by armed combat in sanctioned
arenas located around the world.  This process has maintained peace for over twenty years. But
now something has gone wrong and the soldiers have started to kill everyone in sight. The minds
of the soldiers have been twisted by fiendish brain implants. Players will be dropped into areas to
ferret out the brain controlled soldiers and destroy them. With 8 different worlds to explore, 6

live-action video reenactments, animated battles, and a beautifully designed interface. The disc
captures the emotional toll of the conflict, and the melancholy of the famous general. This
captivating strategy game simulates six famous battles and one fictional skirmish involving Lee's

<p>Army of Virginia. Also included, but somewhat upstaged by the captivating game play, is a rich,
multimedia Civil War reference section.

computer or human opponent (via modem) through individual skirmishes or the entire campaign.
The game's stunning graphics will appeal to strategy fans, while Civil War buffs will love the
attention to detail. A beautifully rendered terrain map helps you keep your bearings; and unlike
with many military sims, an intuitive interface makes it easy to monitor troop strength, health,
morale, and firepower.

deployment with the human side of war. Nightfall on the battlefield is not to be missed, as strife

crackling campfires and rows of tents where columns of men once stood. Cost: $59.95 from

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p> The Holiday season is right around the corner so it's time to start thinking about what to give
that computer user on your list. With this article, I've put together a list of all sorts of hardware
ideas for your gift giving needs. Happy shopping.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Stocking Stuffers: </em>Boxes of floppy disks, mouse pads, CD-ROM jewel cases, zip-drive disks, CD-ROM cleaning kits, disk storage racks, special types of paper for a printer, how-to books, wrist
rests and back supports can all make great gifts at a cost of $25 or less

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you've got a spare couple of thousand sitting around <em><strong>A PC or Mac system</strong></em> is always a nice gift.
I couldn't hope to review all of the countless number of new systems hitting the market this
holiday season but here are a couple that caught my attention.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The <em>Micron's 200-MHZ Home MPC </em>is a multimedia powerhouse ready to respond to all of your
software needs now and in the future (well, at least until the next round of processors make all the
current ones obsolete).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Home MPC's included  Diamond Stealth 3-D Video 2000 card delivers full-motion,
full-screen video thanks to its preloaded MPEG software and 3-D acceleration. Great sound
echos through a Creative Labs Sound Blaster 32 3-D Wavetable audio card and powerful 25-watt
speakers, while the included Microsoft SideWinder 3-D Pro joystick lets you have a blast with the
latest games.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Home MPC comes with an impressive collection of helpful software, including Microsoft
Office  Professional 95 (with Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access and Schedule+), both Microsoft
Money 4.0 and Intuit's Quicken Deluxe 5.0 personal-finance programs, and a library of reference
titles, such as Bookshelf 95, Encarta 96 and Julia Child Home Cooking from Microsoft, plus
Quicken Family Lawyer. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The one snag to all of this is that you'll have to install the programs yourself. However, the
standard 1.2-gigabyte Quantum Fireball 1280 hard drive won't be cluttered with useless pre-installed software  you don't want or need.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Home MPC's 16 megabytes of EDO RAM and fast 200-MHZ Pentium processor is a solid
performer. Micron tops off  the package with a Microsoft mouse, a standard keyboard, and a
bright 17-inch monitor with a .26-mm dot pitch and 85-Hz refresh rate for clear, flicker-free video
display. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The cost for all this power is $3,099 with 16 MB of RAM ( I think for this price they should have
thrown in 24 or 32MB of RAM), 1.2- GB hard drive (might have been a bit larger for the price),
eight-speed CD-ROM drive and 17-inch monitor, from Micron Electronics, (800) 209-9686,
(208) 893-3434. <a href="http://www.mei.micron.com">http://www.mei.micron.com</a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>The IBM Aptiva S78 </em>is one fine looking machine. It's sleek black casing has a futuristic look like
something you might expect to see in an episode of Star Trek Voyager or the X-Files.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The most impressing aspect of the Aptiva S78 is its split components. Unlike other machines,
which sit either on the desk or under it, the Aptiva S78 does both. The minitower, which holds the
hard drive, CPU, RAM, and expansion slots, can be tucked under or even behind a desk. It
doesn't need to be within easy reach because a thin "media console" box slides under the monitor
stand and connects to the tower with a 6-foot-long cable. A pop-up bay in the console contains
the floppy and CD-ROM drives. The 15inch monitor, with wing-mounted speakers at each side,
sits high and dry on a cool two-legged stand.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>With a very functional cordless mouse, unattended receipt of phone messages and faxes (the
Aptiva S78 turns itself on when a call comes in), and notebook like Rapid Resume (which returns
the system to its pre-power-down condition, including open applications), this machine is useful
and a pleasure to use. Its audio is excellent, and the video accelerator whips through 3-D games in
a flash.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Aptiva S78's three-piece construction makes great sense: The components you need are
within easy reach; the ones you don't are out of sight. Add in the great software, handy power-up
and power-down features, and outstanding performance, and you've got one mean machine.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The system comes with a 200MHz Pentium processor,  32MB EDO RAM with 256K cache, 
2MB of VRAM, a 3.2GB Hard Disk, 8x CD-ROM drive, 16-bit IBM Mwave wave-table sound
card, a  33,600-bps fax modem, and a 15-inch IBM multimedia monitor with integrated speakers.
The Cost is $3,899; (800) 426-7235, ext. 4340, (919) 517-2430; <a href="www.pc.ibm.com/aptiva">www.pc.ibm.com/aptiva<em></a></em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em><strong>New CD-ROM Technology:</strong></em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Olympus CD-Recorder Breaks the $500 Barrier:</em> Just a few years ago you couldn't touch a CD-ROM recorder for less than $2,000. Now with the CD-R2x4, making your own CD-ROMs is
within reach. The CD-R2x4 is a multi-session CD-Recorder, bundled with complete mastering
software for Macintosh and Windows. It's one of quickest dual speed CD-R drives with an
average seek time of less than 215 msec. Olympus is also one of the first companies to support
Sony's CD-RFS packet-writing software. CD-RFS allows users to drag files from their Windows
95 desktop directly to a CD, or save files right to a CD from any application. CD-RFS makes CD
recording as easy as writing to a floppy. A nice gift for the computer user who already thinks they
have everything.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Toshiba 12x CD-ROMs:</em> Seems like only yesterday the 4x CD-ROM was top of the line, now
Toshiba has a 12x on the market. Toshiba is the only manufacturer to offer 12-speed CD-ROM
drives in ATAPI and SCSI interfaces. The XM-5701B SCSI and the XM-5702B ATAPI
(enhanced IDE) drives provide increased performance with fast 115ms average random seek and
125ms average random access times.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Designed to provide the fastest possible access to data through enhanced performance, the new
XM-5701B and XM-5702B feature sustained data transfer rates of 1,800KB/sec. For easy set-up
in the SCSI environment, the XM-5701B drive comes complete with SCAM, or "SCSI
Configuration AutoMagically." When users connect the XM-5701B drive through a SCSI port to
a PC or Macintosh, SCAM configures all aspects of the CD-ROM drive with the computer
through the SCSI connection automatically. The SCSI XM-5701B also provides Plug-and-Play
compatibility. Suggested list prices for the drives are: $195 for the XM-5701B SCSI and $165 for
the XM-5702B ATAPI (I'm sure we can all remember only a few years ago when a 2x drive cost
more than that).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em><strong>Hot New Printers:</strong></em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Macintosh Printers<strong>:</strong> </em>The Epson Stylus Color 500 is a great inexpensive printer for the Mac. It
produces beautiful color prints, has a CD loaded with Mac and Windows application software,
and includes both serial and parallel ports. The Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 870Cse is also a solid
option for Mac printing, with its mix of rapid output, fine print quality, and dependable
performance.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Apple's offers the <em>Color StyleWriter 2500</em> and <em>Color StyleWriter 1500</em>, both good products based
on Canon technology (though they are a generation behind Canon's current printers). The 2500
costs $389 with 720x360 dpi inch text and graphics, nice text printing, and easy to use operation.
The 1500 is a low-cost ($289) product with decent output, though definitely a cut below the
2500's. But neither of them can match the output quality, speed, and overall price/performance
ratio of the Epson printer.
</em>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em><em>High Color- Low Price</em>: With breathtaking color output, sharp text pages, easy operation, and a
great price, the Epson Stylus Color 500 is a great all-around printer. Whatever the reasons your
considering a color ink-jet printer -- photo-like color pages, value, worthwhile software -- the
Epson is the best answer to be found.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Color ink-jets live and die by the quality of the output they produce, and here the Epson
outclasses many of it's competitors. Its 720-dot-per-inch technology produced documents that
were sharp in either black or color. On coated paper, the Epson came closer to matching the
quality of lab-processed color photographs than any other color ink-jet I've ever seen.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For this printer, Epson has come up with some new ink formulations that produce outstanding
output on both plain and glossy paper. The blacks were solid and balanced, and the color was the
most natural of the many ink-jet print-outs I have seen, although the reds in graphics tended just a
bit toward orange. Although the high-resolution 720-dpi mode works well with plain paper, you'll
get truly photo-quality results only on coated stock.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To help you get the most from the 500, Epson ships an easy start-up package and a CD-ROM
with software for producing everything from newsletters to T-shirts and refrigerator magnets.
Among the applications included on the Color Pak CD-ROM are Adobe PhotoDeluxe, Sierra
Print Artist (for Windows systems), Adobe Home Publisher (for Macs), and lots of extra pictures
and fonts.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Adding to this printer's appeal was a very good warranty (two years of coverage and toll-free
support). Epson has a clear winner with the 500. The price is right, the output is easily the best,
and the entire package simply says, Buy me. Epson America, 800-289-3776 ext. 3000. $279
estimated street cost.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em><strong>Storage Devices:</strong></em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Last year the Iomega ZipDrive was the darling of disk back-up storage devices. Since then a
whole host of these types of drives have hit the market. Notable this year are some new products
from SyQuest.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>EZ135 Parallel Port External Drive: </em>From SyQuest is really something. You get the ability to
back up your files (up to 135 Megs of them) to a removable disk. Much like the Iomega ZipDrive
that it competes against, the EZ135 is a nice little unit to backup files with or to carry data from
one computer to another easily. Around $200. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SyQuest also has the<em> EZFlyer 230</em>, at $299, it's a significantly superior product to Iomega's Zip
drive. This is hard drive technology, therefore the access time and performance is vastly superior
to any floppy drive technology. Uses a 230MB storage cartridge that costs about $30.Also just
shipping is the SyQuest <em>SyJet</em> removable cartridge drive. It's  a 1.3GB product that allows you to
back up a hardrive in minutes. Larger capacity than the touted Jaz, equal to or better
performance. Cost is about $500.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Hard Drives</em> come in all types of sizes. An average price for a decent 1.2-1.6GB drive is
somewhere between $200-300. Larger drives such as a 2GB are selling for $300-500. This isn't
bad when compared to the prices of last year which were practically double. If the person on your
list is complaining about lack of space - a new hard drive makes a great gift. Just make sure you
find out exactly what their system can handle so you buy the right one.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em><strong>Mice, Joysticks, Game Pads:</strong></em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Looking Beyond The Mouse:</em> The keyboard and mouse are devices most commonly used to
control computers. In the days of DOS, with its text-oriented applications, we needed only
keyboards. With the advent of the Macintosh and Windows, though, a mouse was a must.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Today's multimedia software, with state-of-the-art graphics and sound, requires even more
precision. Anyone trying to operate the simplest flight simulator or play a game of Duke Nukem
3D knows what I mean. Games aside, graphical applications such as architectural programs and
other types of computer-assisted design cry out for something more. I've found a few new gizmos
that you should check out:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>SpaceOrb 360</em> ($99) is designed to be comfortably held in both hands. Its tightly arced crescent
shape sports four buttons positioned under your right thumb, along with two more on the
crescent's edge for your right index finger.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>But the real genius behind SpaceOrb is the orb. It's made from a rubberized high-friction material
that makes it nearly impossible to slip. You can grip the sphere neatly in your left hand. It
provides a multi-axis 360-degree control in every direction. In addition to moving the orb like a
joystick for left-right-forward-back movement, you can press it down and lift it up. You can also
twist the orb at any point, but it does not rotate freely like a trackball. Release the orb and it
springs back to the neutral position. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SpaceOrb includes a demo program that perfectly illustrates this multi-axis control by displaying a
simple jack-in-the-box. Pressing the orb in any direction bends the jack's long accordion neck;
pressing the orb up and down makes the neck stretch and collapse. Twisting the orb makes the
jack's head look around. All of these moves can be simultaneously combined for an instant
accuracy that would be almost impossible with conventional controllers.

<p><em>Vivitar's WJ2000 </em>joystick ($129) is for those who want the accuracy of a joystick but crave the
freedom of wireless technology. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This is more than just a joystick that has shed its wires: It has no base, either. The unit looks like a
small ray gun that you hold in mid-air. Rotating your wrist counter-clockwise or clockwise moves
things left or right. Tilting it forward and angling backward gives you corresponding movements.
It's like gripping a virtual or an ``air'' joystick. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The receiving unit plugs into your PC's standard game port and doubles as a stand to hold the
WJ2000 when it's not in use. In addition to the freedom of movement, the WJ2000 offers two
triggers that are easily squeezed with the second and third fingers. If you want a more traditional
approach, flick a switch and you can use your other hand to press the four flush-mounted
directional buttons on top. Spacetec IMC (508) 970-0330 Vivitar (805) 498-7008

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Thrustmaster's new joystick, <em>TOP GUN, </em>with an estimated street price between $35.00 to $39.95
is a great buy this holiday season.  Modeled after the grip found in the F-4 Phantom fighter jet, the
TOP GUN joystick excels in all action, combat and flight simulator games.  No matter  what the
game scenario might be, TOP GUN gives the user an added advantage of speed, agility and
increased response time. For more information: call (503) 615-3237 or go to the ThrustMaster
Web site at http://www.thrustmaster.com.

<p><em>Microsoft's new IntelliMouse</em> features a new combination wheel/button that lets you scroll up and
down Web pages (and wheel-compatible documents) in any direction onscreen. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Click the wheel once and documents continuously roll by like a TelePrompter message. In
Microsoft's upcoming Office '97 products, you'll be able to use the button in combination with the
Control key to reduce or enlarge documents. In Windows 95's Explorer, you'll strike the Shift key
and hold down the button to collapse and expand menu trees. Right now, Microsoft is the only
developer to offer compatible software, but third-party developers will soon announce their plans
to take this mouse for a spin. Microsoft; $84.95; (800) 426-9400; (206) 882-8080;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em><strong>Other Ideas</strong></em>:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Connectix has a new spin on last year's hot Quick Cam; the Color Quick Cam. This little tennis
size camera allows you to record color images to your PC/Mac. At $250 (around $200 with a
rebate that Connectix is offering) the price still seems a little high just to be able to record things
near my PC. I do see how some professionals might use the Quick Cam for creating sales or
marketing presentations. It is memory intensive, requiring 16MB when using Windows 95, 8MB
for Mac and Windows 3.11.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>RAM</em>- with RAM prices still relatively cheap, adding memory to a system is a great gift idea.
Again, make sure you check with the person you're buying the memory for as to what type they
need. Sure asking them will spoil the surprise, but not asking could make the surprise a
disappointment if you get the wrong kind of memory.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>While not a hardware device,<em> screen savers</em> always make a nice gift. Today's monitors don't
really need screen savers as they no longer have the problems of burn-in. However, screen savers
are fun and add some life to your system. Berkeley Systems has a new version of it's award
winning <em>After Dark Screen Saver</em>. Version 4.0 includes over 20 new animated displays and 50
desktop wallpaper patterns to spruce up your screen's looks. It also includes a link to After Dark
Online; a web based new delivery screen saver service. You setup the schedule on when the news
is updated and After Dark dials into their web site and updated the info as requested. $40 from
Berkeley Systems. You can also get the After Dark Online screen saver as a download by going
to http://www.afterdark.com.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>With this short review, I've just scratched the surface of hardware available for the holidays.
There's a lot more hardware out there waiting to grab your dollars. One thing I would like to
emphasis when shopping for hardware is that you SHOP AROUND. Prices can vary from store to
store by wide margins. Also, don't rule out the mail order houses. Some catalog companies like
ComputAbility or Insight offer great deals, low prices, a nice selection of products and next day
shipping. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Above all, find out what the store's return policy is before you buy and SAVE your receipts when
you purchase an item. Good luck in finding the perfect gift. Shop early and beat the rush.

<title>Disney's Animated StoryBook, Toy Story</title>

<font color="#ff0000"></font><font color="#ff0000"><h2><strong></strong><strong>Disney's Animated StoryBook, Toy Story</strong></font></h2>
<h3><font color="#ff0000">By A. Accetta</font></h3>

<p><font color="#ff0000"><hr>
</font>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Following close on the heels of the video release of this very popular Disney movie comes the
animated storybook on CD-ROM.  Disney's Toy Story is a condensed version of the movie,
complete with the same phenomenal Pixar Studios-produced animation, and the familiar character
voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen that delighted movie goers so much. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In case you've never seen the movie or the countless commercials and blatant promotions on TV,
the story goes like this: Woody, an old-fashioned pull-string cowboy, is the top toy in little Andy's
toy collection. He and the other toys take their job of being toys very seriously. Their biggest
fears are being replaced, getting broken, or becoming lost. They dread Christmas and Andy's
birthday, the two main days when Andy gets new toys.<p>
<center><img src="http://www.tccmweb.com/swcm/toys2.jpg"></center><p> 
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Toy Story begins with Andy's birthday, and at which he receives an awesome action figure called
Buzz Lightyear, who's got a laser beam, karate-chop action, pop-out wings, and glow-in-the-dark
paint! All the toys (except Woody) are impressed by the amazing Buzz, and soon he is everyone's  
favorite toy. Woody is upset by all this, especially since Buzz doesn't even know he's a toy--he
thinks he's a real Space Ranger!

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Woody tries to get rid of Buzz, but things backfire and he finds himself lost in the outside world
with Buzz. They land in the clutches of  the biggest villain of all: Sid, the toy destroyer. To top
things off, Andy and his family have moved. To survive and return to Andy, Woody and Buzz
must work together and they need your help..

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Toy Story Animated StoryBook is a CD-ROM adventure where you bring the story to life. With
the click of a mouse, you'll enter a wild 3-D world where wonderfully animated toys come to life.
As you read along (or have the narrator read for you), it's up to you to help toys Woody and Buzz
escape bad boy, toy-destroying Sid, catch the moving van, and become best buddies along the
way as they try to get back to Andy. There's also some new animation done especially for the CD-ROM.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Built around ten screen shots, the Toy Story CD captures the story line of the movie pretty well.
The program is basically a 15 page electronic book with activities. Your host is Hamm the
talkative Piggy Bank in the movie. John Ratzenberger, well known as Cliff Clavin on the TV
series Cheers,  reprises his role as the voice of Hamm.  The program is presented with the same
excellent Pixar Studios 3D animation that made the movie such a delight.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In addition to Ratzenberger's reading of a small piece of highlighted text on each screen, Toy
Story includes five integrated activities that include mazes, counting and sorting games, and the
creation of a chain reaction sequence. All of the characters from the movie are here, Po Peep,
Slinky Dog,  the Green Army Men, Mr. Potato Head, and even Sid's mutant toys. Unlike some
previous Disney StoryBooks, these activity screens are not optional side-roads to the story line;
here, they are inserted directly between sequences in the story. The activities focus on early
learning skills, like matching colors, hand eye coordination, following oral directions, addition and
subtraction, and navigating mazes. One activity I liked was a version of the old "you're getting
warmer" location game. These are good early learning tools for your child. Best of all, if your
child has problems during one of the activities, the on-screen characters offer hints and  positive
reinforcement. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Toy Story installed without difficulty. Beware, however, that this is a power-hungry, memory
intensive application. I had to reboot my system before I could run the program. The manual was
so-so, focusing mainly on the activities included and some trouble shooting. However, Disney
offers a 1-800 tech support line, six days/week, open to registered users.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If your child is between five and nine, and saw the movie a couple of times, this is a program you
won't be able to pull them away from. Toy Story can also be enjoyed by children who haven't
seen the movie, but who enjoy animated book  programs with lots of
'click-and-something-happens' objects. Toy Story screens are filled with 14 or more clickable
objects per screen that say or do something when activated. I haven't seen so many clickable
objects on screen since 7th Level's TuneLand of a few years ago. The program has of course an
educational purpose as well. It teaches your children counting, sorting, spatial relations and
following directions all wrapped around some of the best animation I have ever seen. Lastly, the
program will make a nice holiday gift to go along with the video. From Disney Interactive,
800-688-1520 for around $35.<strong></strong>

<title>3-D SPEX: not what I expected</title>
</head>
<body text="#000000" link="#0000ff" vlink="#551a8b" alink="#ff0000"

<h2><strong><font color="#ff0000">3-D SPEX: not what I expected</font></strong></h2>
<h3><font color="#000080">By Don Nelson</font></h3>

<p><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>When I was given the assignment of reviewing a pair of new 3-D gaming glasses my thoughts
were of  those stupid little paper glasses (with one red and one blue lens) I wore at the 3-D
movies as a kid. When I checked out NuVision Technologies' new 3-D SPEX and I realized this
wasn't the 3-D technology of my youth. Things had come a long way. But, after using the glasses
I think technology still has some way to go before actually giving the user a real 3-D experience
on the PC screen.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The product comes with the glasses (which look like a nice pair of sunglasses with green lenses),
a little plastic do-dad that connects to your PC's parallel port and two CD-ROMs that contain the
drivers for running the glasses and three very similar space-shoot-em up games. The games are
Descent (tm) II Destination Quartzon (OEM version, 8 levels) by Interplay (tm) Slipstream 5000
(tm) from Gremlin (full retail version) Whiplash (tm) (full retail version) by Interplay(tm)/Gremlin.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>My first try at loading the product up on a 486, 100mhz system with 8MB of RAM (the minimum
required) met with some problems. The software loaded fine and the glasses began to work (they
supposedly operate by shutters opening and closing each lens so fast that the picture looks smooth
and gives the illusion of 3-D viewing). The problem was that the game ran very slow and was for
the most part unplayable. I struggled to move the spacecraft out of the hanger but the system was
to sluggish. In addition, the lenses flickered to the point of giving me a headache. After about two
minutes I shut the whole thing down.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>I then tried a Pentium 100mhz and things got a bit better. I loaded the program and put on the
glasses and was engulfed in a three-dimensional game field that was, for this limited technology,
fairly realistic. Objects appeared to loom in the distance or float before my eyes, all in pretty fine
detail. The speed of the lenses improved and I was not able to sense the opening and closing of
the lens shutters as I had been under the 486.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>I do not think that these glasses are for everyone. They can, if left on for long periods of time,
produce eye-strain. And while the glasses are pretty comfortable to wear, the wire attached to
them is a bit annoying and you must also remember to stay a fair distance from the screen or
suffer the blurring of the 3-D effects. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>With only three games shipping with the glasses, and not much else yet available for play with 3-D
SPEX , your use of the product is somewhat limited. Especially since two of the games are sort of
lame, and Descent II isn't that much better. I also did not like the fact that the product is set to
run in MS DOS or the DOS only mode of Windows 95. I was hoping that there would be
Windows 95 games available. I feel that shoot-em up and flight games could really come into their
own if NuVision improves on this technology; and perhaps subsequent versions will offer a true 3-D experience. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For $99 the product is O.K. providing  you have the money to spend. If buying this product and
say some new RAM or another software is a choice, I suggest you buy the RAM or the other
software. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>System Requirements

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A 486 DX2/66 (you really need a Pentium Class Processor), 8M of RAM (though it will run
much better with 16M of RAM), an SVGA color monitor that supports 100 Hz refresh rate; a
video card that supports VESA1.2 BIOS in ROM or VBE emulator, a 4X or better CD-ROM,
30-80MB of free hard drive space, DOS 5.0 or later, including MS DOS only mode of Windows
95, and a Parallel port.

<title>It's A Buyer's Market This Season</title>
</head>
<body text="#000000" link="#0000ff" vlink="#551a8b" alink="#ff0000"

<h2><strong></strong><strong><font color="#008000">It's A Buyer's Market This Season</font></strong></h2>
<font color="#ff0000"><h3>By Trish Roberts</font></h3>

<p><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Last holiday season, we consumers were at the mercy of the computer industry. We wanted or
needed new systems and the PC makers knew it. This year, the ball is in our court. Industry
analysts are reporting that PC makers fear that we might not buy a new machine at all this year;
sales numbers are a-sliding downhill and with it prices.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Part of the reason for this is that such a large number of people bought or upgraded computers
during the frenzy of 1995's Internet and Windows 95 techno-hype. This year there is no huge
media push for a new machine, and there is no startling breakthrough product that every 
consumer can't do without. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Meanwhile, many customers have quickly adapted to the technological revolution, but the
majority of retail computer chains are still set up to pull in "newbies" -- specifically, first-time
buyers. Last week we saw price cuts from Apple; this week NEC has decreased prices on
corporate desktop models. Prices on the Entry Value, Value, Performance and Professional series
in the PowerMate line have been cut up to 18 percent. These are all high-end Pentium and
Pentium Pro machines. Why these cuts on professional systems now, during the consumer holiday
shopping push? Well, Apple, NEC, and Compaq all suffered sales drops this year, and they're
slashing prices to increase demand. Compaq price have fallen as I write this article, as have those
of Dell and Hewlett Packard.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As our culture becomes less intimidated by computers, more and more people are beginning to
make their second PC purchases from used PC brokers and direct sellers. Both Dell and Gateway
have been profiting from this situation. Dell, in fact, just further reduced prices on its corporate
OptiPlex PCS. The biggest reduction was on the OptiPlex GL166, now down 7.8 percent to
$2,189. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Home computers are being marketed in any way possible. The major buying audience is baby
boomers. That's you, right? Come on, don't try to tell me that you don't fit the very busy,
middle-class, gadget-envy stereotype. Based on this profile, you can expect marketers to appeal to
your need for a PC that can take care of time-intensive tasks as well as to your desire for the
latest gadgets, and to tempt you with bundling bargains and financing promotions. So watch for
PCs with voice mail, fast 33.6 modems, personal digital assistants, personal finance software,
ergonomic keyboards, bundled printers or monitors, and no-interest-for-X-months or
no-money-down deals this holiday season. I plan to buy that high-end Pentium I've had my eye on
- and I know that in just a couple more weeks and they'll be begging me to buy I at a price I
wouldn't have thought possible a few months ago.
