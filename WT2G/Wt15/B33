<h2>
Has the WTO Threatened Us?
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
Well, it happened: the World Trade Organization ruled against an 
existing law, and people are up in arms. Candidates Dole and Buchanan 
have suggested that this is on the order of the British navy moving in 
to restore the crown as sovereign in U.S. affairs.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Here is the quarrel. Brazil and Venezuela, in recent months, attempted 
to bring into the United States what we might as well call "dirty 
oil," meaning that it is oil that contains a higher density of 
pollutants than is permitted by the Clean Air Act. So, we denied that 
oil access to the American market. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A suit was filed with the WTO by Brazil and Venezuela, which asserted, 
correctly, that the same quality of oil turned down at our frontier 
was in fact being pumped, sold, and burned within the United States. 
This is, plain and simple, discriminatory, and of course the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade exists in order to protest 
discriminatory practices.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Now the United States has several defenses, none of them conclusive -- 
they are an attenuation of the violation rather than an excuse for it. 
It happens that the load of oil being permitted to market 
notwithstanding its high pollution content was something on the order 
of an exception. The franchise was given with a view to saving a 
considerable deposit of oil, on the understanding that the 
international standard would be invoked beginning in 1998. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Now if one engages in a treaty of this kind there has to be an arbiter 
somewhere. The disarmament treaties of the Twenties and Thirties 
failed for many reasons, but one of them was that there was no 
effective tribunal to call attention to the violations of Germany, 
Italy, and Japan. For that reason, a court was set up, armed with the 
power to make a finding (subject to appeal) and to levy either a fine, 
if the situation was not rectifiable, or else compensation (to the 
wounded nation or industry). The court, having ruled against the 
United States, has not come through with a specified penalty, and in 
any event, this being the very first ruling the WTO has come through 
with, there is abounding procedural confusion. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One source of the confusion is the motives and political interests of 
the people involved, directly and indirectly. Mickey Kantor is of 
course our trade representative. He is having a hell of a time. On the 
one hand, he very much wants to defend the environmental code approved 
by President Clinton, which means, No dirty oil. On the other hand, he 
desperately wishes to be outside the line of fire directed against 
those who tolerate an extra-national body telling the United States 
what to do. To date, Mr. Kantor has said that in fact the court is 
factually correct; that the court has no right, really, to rule on 
U.S. environmental laws; and that the United States will appeal -- 
probably. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Now the long perspective on the question is that the GATT treaty was a 
dozen years in formation, under the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton 
Administrations, with the Congress as a prime mover. Our motives were 
simple: most trade discrimination in the world is against U.S. 
producers. We have, we thought, and thought correctly, more to gain 
than to lose by endorsing a court that could actually hand down 
rulings of the kind that free up trade. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Bob Dole and Pat Buchanan are talking about the hideous nature of an 
extra-national authority, and Mr. Buchanan even said that when he 
became President, the first thing he would do is repeal the GATT 
treaty. But the U.S. position is made difficult by the simple fact 
that a) we promoted and passed the GATT agreement (while avoiding the 
treaty requirement to come in with two-thirds of the Senate vote), 
endorsing b) a fact-finding body (the court) that would look into 
complaints and c) dispose of sanctions in the event a signatory was 
found guilty of discriminatory practices.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
We now have several alternatives. We can resign from GATT, which would 
be a long-term invitation to restricted trading; or we can pay the 
fine or compensation on the Brazilian and Venezuelan oil; or we can 
modify the Clean Air Act to exempt the privileged producer of the 
dirty oil. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What we can't do is argue that somebody took away our lollipop. We are 
a grown-up nation, and if we pulled a fast one at the expense of a law 
we ourselves promoted and ratified, then we should take the 
punishment. If ever the WTO engages in systematic anti-U.S. rulings, 
why it becomes simple. We pull out. But not before that happens.

<title>Buckley: School Uniforms?! -- 1/26/96</title>

<h2>
School Uniforms?!
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
buckley
.html">
William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
One commentator dealt bravely with the seven general categories of 
national problems addressed by President Clinton and finished his 
appraisal with the sentence, "Why on earth does the leader of the free 
world have to concern himself with school uniforms?"
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Well now, there are those who found that the most novel and 
potentially the most resonant sentence in the President's address. 
Flash ahead ten years, close your eyes, answer the question: "What was 
the highlight of President Clinton's State of the Union speech in 
1996?" Right, the answer will be: Oh, that's the speech in which he 
came out for school uniforms. . . . To say that was the "highlight" of 
the speech is of course to take liberties, consigning all else he said 
to generic political thought. The President declared in favor of 
health care, law and order, unity, growth, and husbandry. So does 
every candidate running for President. It was the school-uniform bit 
that caught the attention of the unwary, who asked first, What does 
Mr. Clinton know about school uniforms? and asked second, How is it 
that he intuits their importance?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Not long ago a public-school teacher in New York City wrote to the 
Wall Street Journal a letter bristling with authenticity, relating 
that the foremost problem in the city's schools was: discipline. In 
the absence of it, she complained, practically nothing else is 
possible. What has been called the "hijacker's leverage" is operative 
here. Just as one terrorist can dictate the movements of a super-jet 
carrying five hundred passengers, so one unruly student can, for as 
long as he is able to keep it up, affect the climate of a schoolroom. 
In the late Sixties, one senior at Harvard appeared at the office of 
the president hours before the Commencement ceremony demanding that he 
be scheduled as a speaker during the ceremony. If not, he informed the 
stunned president, the ceremony would not proceed. A half-dozen noisy 
protestors, even in an assembly of two thousand, can make solemn 
processions impossible; as also, studious classrooms. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The head of Cardinal Hayes High School in New York made a point of it 
some years ago. That school -- formally a diocesan school although 
many of its students are of other faiths, 85 per cent of them 
minorities -- has arresting academic attainments; 85 per cent of its 
graduates go on to college, compared with less than 15 per cent in 
comparable public schools made up of identically endowed students. It 
is very important, the principal told his visitor, to insist on a 
school uniform. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why? one naturally wondered. Because, he said, the symbol irradiates 
several things. The first is that the student is a member of a 
regulated community. When you are in uniform, your dress bespeaks 
hierarchy. The symbol is very important. At Cardinal Hayes the 
students are simply not expected to be late in arriving at school, and 
punctuality is accepted as a part of the system: related, in a way, to 
the requirement that the students wear their simple grey jackets and 
pants, a shirt and a tie. On the question of disorder in the 
classrooms it is as simple as that there is no disorder in the 
classrooms. Defenders of the antinomian behavior of so many public-
school students confide to you that the reason for the success of the 
private schools is that they simply expel anyone who is in any way 
nonconformist. But such chaos-defenders run into statistics: 2 per 
cent of the students at Cardinal Hayes are expelled. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The maintenance of order, the minor conformity that issues from the 
wearing of identical uniforms, is always a latent problem because the 
schools deal with boys and girls who are going through their unruly 
period in life. The sociologist who some time ago remarked that a 
single broken and unrepaired window is an invitation to corollary 
shambles gave us all an epiphany. Of course it is true! we realize. 
Student unruliness is met in different seasons in different ways. At 
Eton in the 1830s the students outnumbered faculty by about 100 to 1, 
and the notorious Doctor Keate attempted to solve his problem by 
flogging a dozen students every day. We shrink from such measures, but 
ought to welcome civilized substitutes, and the school uniform is the 
beginning of wisdom in this field, and we say hurrah to the President 
for coming upon that insight.

<title>Buckley: Misfire On Drug Policy -- 1/30/96</title>

<h2>
Misfire On Drug Policy
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
buckley
.html">
William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
The bipartisan Council on Crime in America, whose most conspicuous 
spokesman is William Bennett, does fine work, but when it touches on 
the matter of drugs its analytical powers simply decompose, as though 
the writer were high on crack cocaine or the legal stuff.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last week the Council exploded in opposition to the call for an 
approach to the legalization of drugs made by seven writers (myself 
included) in this journal. To the title of the symposium -- "The War 
on Drugs Is Lost" -- the Council replies that that is most certainly 
not so. To the end of proving this, it cites the reduction of drug use 
by non-addicts. It declined by 50 per cent between 1979 and 1992. The 
planted axiom of course is that that decline is owing to the war on 
drugs. But what is it that accounts for the decline in the number of 
users of tobacco during the same period, from 33.5 million to 26.5 
million? The use of tobacco is not illegal. But since 1979, and 
beginning even before that, the deleterious effect of cigarettes was 
so persuasively argued that even William Bennett gave up smoking.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A look at the formal side of the war on drugs is required. If 
something is illegal, then the law that makes it so is effective to 
the extent that it imprisons those who violate it, thereby 
hypothetically reducing the number of lawbreakers. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That would seem obvious, but isn't to the distinguished members of the 
Council on Crime in America. In 1985, 811,000 arrests were made for 
drug offenses. In 1994, 1.35 million arrests were made for drug 
offenses. Does that mean that the war on drugs is effective? Well, no. 
An effective law diminishes, rather than increases, the number of 
violators who have to be arrested. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And then of course one asks, If 1.35 million drug users were arrested 
in 1994, how many drug users were not arrested? The Council informs us 
that there are more than 4 million casual users of cocaine (defined as 
people who use it less than once a week). How so? Why haven't they 
been arrested? And goes on to say that there are over 2.2 million 
heavy (at least weekly) users. That makes a total of 6.2 million who 
violate the law from once a week, to every two weeks or so. How 
effective is the war when such figures can be cited? Now take the big 
one. There are over 70 million Americans who have smoked marijuana, 
and about 10 million who continue to do so. Why aren't they in jail? 
Does the Council on Crime in America really wish that they were in 
jail?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It must have embarrassed the Council that the same week it sputtered 
forth on the great success of the war on drugs, The Economist cited 
another Council report on crime in America which gainsays its entire 
position on the drug war. We learn that only one criminal is jailed 
for every hundred violent crimes committed; that over one-half of 
America's convicted felons are not sentenced to prison (because, in 
part, the prisons are full); that the most violent criminals serve 
less than one-half their sentences, and the average murderer released 
in 1992 from a state prison had served only 5.9 years.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Economist cites the experience of a patrolman in Haughville, a 
scruffy area of Indianapolis. "He drives up and down in the evenings, 
past anoraked figures who stand outside liquor stores and turn their 
faces from him. He can guess what they are; few people apart from drug 
dealers stand around on nights like this, when the puddles in the 
potholes freeze hard. Besides, Patrolman Reichle knows most of them: 
he reckons he has arrested one in five of these young men." City 
prosecutors "do not even bring charges against drug dealers until they 
have been arrested several times. Those who do get charged and found 
guilty will not go to prison, unless they have other convictions. 
President Bill Clinton's call for a crackdown on drug dealers sounds 
pretty hollow in Haughville."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Such is overcrowding in state prisons in Indiana -- notwithstanding 
that the national increase in prison space is threefold since we 
decided to wage hard war on drugs -- that even a relatively new 
American prison might have merited describing by Charles Dickens. 
"Prisoners pass their days in narrow, ill-lit cages; there are no 
chairs or tables, so the men pace up and down like zoo animals or 
slouch upon the floor."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So what has the war done? It has made a mockery of an anti-drug law 
that is simply ignored by millions; it has induced violent felonies in 
pursuit of drug profits; and it is self-evidently powerless to do 
anything about the recent increase in marijuana use by reckless 
adolescents. It is a pity that men and women of the moral and 
intellectual character of William Bennett treat drug legalization as 
the equivalent of moral acquiescence in drug abuse, when other reasons 
for repealing our stupid laws are so clearly articulated, primary 
among them to relieve non-drug users from the heavy load they bear in 
the phony and ineffective war. One forgets -- who won the Hundred 
Years War back then? Was it really necessary to take it on for one 
hundred years?

<title>Buckley: The Problem of the Fatherless Child I -- 2/6/96</title>

<h2>
The Problem of the Fatherless Child I
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
The weekend paper ran a cartoon by Mike Smith of the North American 
Syndicate. In a sequence, the freckled little girl with long hair, 
reproduced eight times with eight balloons, tells us what she is 
thinking: "This is Cindy." "Cindy is 13 years old." "Which means she 
can't drink." "She can't drive." "She can't even buy cigarettes." 
"Which is all the better for the health and safety . . . of her 
daughter." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In October, in this space, I designated the single-parent household, 
as so many others have, as the primary social problem in America. I 
meditated that since the steep rise in illegitimate births over the 
past thirty years (from 5 per cent to 18 per cent among whites; 25 to 
63 per cent among blacks) few ideas have crystallized on how to arrest 
a development that is afflicting one million children per year (they 
will in their lifetime -- mostly before they reach maturity -- run a 
600 per cent greater chance than children raised by two parents of 
life in poverty, criminal activity, addiction to drugs, illiteracy). 
The single novel idea, developed at systematic length, is that of 
Charles Murray, who in his book Losing Ground endorsed an end to 
public welfare as a disincentive to sexual promiscuity (and to sloth). 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I asked readers to share with me their own suggestions on how to deal 
with the problem. The reply was overwhelming, over eight hundred 
letters, and I take this opportunity to thank them deeply and to 
apologize for the mechanical impossibility of acknowledging them 
individually.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is no mistaking the anger out there. It tends to focus on that 
which is most palpable: The cost imposed on the individual whose 
sexual activity is conventional, by those who proceed to produce 
children who then become, in virtue of the father's absence and 
dereliction, charges to them. One mother writes that she thinks it 
wrong, somehow, that her daughter and son-in-law are postponing a 
family until their material fortunes improve, yet find themselves 
helping to pay for the support of other mothers who do not postpone 
motherhood until after they are married.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some who complain focus on the moral dereliction of the here-today 
gone-tomorrow sire, some focus primarily on the utilitarian question: 
What to do about people who misbehave in a world in which misbehavior 
is usually not defined in a moral context. It may be legal misbehavior 
to deny an opportunity for equal treatment to a minority 18-year old, 
but it is not legal misbehavior to deny equal treatment to an infant 
born out of wedlock.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But some do focus on the quite extraordinary insouciance of the young 
generation of studs. One lawyer from South Dakota who has heard "over 
seven hundred child-support cases" sends along a transcript (the names 
of the principals are blacked out), of an illuminating example.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The situation was as follows. The young defendant is brought in to 
answer for his failure to send the required check to the mother of two 
of his children. We learn that he has sired a third child by another 
woman, and his complaint is that he simply cannot earn enough money to 
satisfy the demands being made on him, and the court simply has to 
recognize this.
<p>
REFEREE: So you're saying that you're going to hide out from the child 
support obligation?
<p>
DAD: I would if need be.<p> 
REFEREE: You know it's possible that could be a felony?
<p>
DAD: Yes, I know that.
<p>
REFEREE: You, I assume voluntarily engaged in intercourse with each of 
those women, is that much correct?
<p>
DAD: Mm-hmm.
<p>
REFEREE: And the consequence was that on at least three occasions 
these women conceived and had children?
<p>
DAD: Yeah.
<p>
REFEREE: And that certainly isn't society's fault.
<p>
DAD: I never said it was.
<p>
REFEREE: You know, society's not treating you unfairly. You weren't 
required to have any children.
<p>
DAD: Well, I don't think it's, you know, up to society to not let me 
have a living at the same time, either. . . . There's got to be a 
compromise so the State can be happy and I can be happy too.
<p> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Respondents were all but unanimous in asking the law to bear down on 
the fathers, mostly absent. Some suggest DNA tests immediately after 
birth, when more often than not the father shows up proudly, even if 
it is only for a few weeks: do a DNA on the baby and the father, to 
preserve perpetual evidence of biological responsibility. And then, 
not a few respondents ask, Why is it not criminal, the activity we 
speak of?

<h2>
The Problem of the Fatherless Child II
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
We pursue the social problem of one million children per year born 
into fatherless homes and review some of the letters from hundreds of 
readers who wrote in to make suggestions on how to deal with a problem 
that began its steep rise approximately in 1965. And many ask, Why 
ought it not to be a crime to father a child out of wedlock?
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Indeed. It's a crime to drive when one has had too much to drink, 
though the statistical chances the driver will hurt somebody when his 
blood alcohol is 0.1 are less than that he will have hurt the child he 
sired. Two out of five black men in Washington, D.C., between the ages 
of 18 and 25 are in jail, on probation, or being prosecuted, in an 
area in which over 75 per cent of black children are born to an 
unmarried mother.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A fair question.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Several respondents remind us that there are laws against statutory 
rape. But the paradox is that if you have sex with a girl under 18 you 
can be jailed in most states, but if you have sex with a girl under 18 
who becomes pregnant, the organically required "rape" dematerializes. 
And over 30 per cent of the fatherless children are born to mothers 
under twenty.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The indignation, resentment, and scorn came in profusely, and from the 
tenor of most letters one could discern that they were not written by 
censorious temperaments. A great many wondered what has happened to 
the primary sanction against illegitimacy in the past, which has been 
shame. Shame before God, yes, but also before the community. "She has 
to feel the pain of society's anger and disapproval of her 
irresponsible, selfish act. Pain hurts, there's a recoiling reaction 
to it." "Bring back the old stocks of the Puritan times . . . 
Wrongdoers could go to work and support their families but when not at 
their places of employment spend so many hours a day on public 
exhibition."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some call for compulsory national service for the father, penal in 
character . . . Yes, deny them what most desire intensely, a driver's 
license . . . Some would make the father the legal custodian of the 
child, taking the mother for special training.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Several decry the failure of black leaders sufficiently to emphasize 
the terrible damage done by wanton sex. "If thirty years ago I were a 
Ku Klux Klan leader who would want to do major damage to blacks, I 
would invent the welfare system."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many favor biological intervention. Norplants, vasectomies, tubal 
ligations. Many caution against the facile alternative of abortions, 
but some, including self-professed Catholics, argue that abortion 
under the circumstances is merciful . . . Why not move against the 
lubricity of the rock and roll culture, by such measures as advocated 
by Senator Dole? Or, "Establish public brothels in strategic areas 
where illegitimacy is most prevalent."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The proffered approaches depended heavily on what respondents saw as 
the primary cause of the blight. The blame is, for some, primarily 
that of the government (welfare, lax law enforcement, the improper use 
of tax revenues). For others, the culture -- the movies, TV, rap 
music, pornography, ultra-feminism, divorce. And for others the 
evanescence of the idea of -- Sin.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"There is only one solution, and you know what it is. The moral law of 
the Supreme Being." "The deterrents you outlined in your column? You 
called them the equivalent of Pentagon contingency plans to invade 
Switzerland: i.e., they're not going to happen. You're right. The sad 
fact is that the one major success the liberals have had is the 
destruction of the family during the last 30 years. What worked for 
the first 190 years in this country is no longer possible or even 
worth writing about. The family is the basic unit of our society and 
it has a cancer. And yet the components of the cancer -- illegitimacy, 
promiscuity, adultery, increased divorce, homosexuality -- are 
accepted as 'lifestyles' and even exalted. . . . "
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I reiterate my thanks to the 800 plus who wrote in. The research in 
hand will be made available to any responsible researcher or research 
organization willing to bear the cost of reproduction.

<h2>
Oh No! Running for President?
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
buckley

William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
Mr. Yeltsin has announced that he will run for re-election as 
President of Russia. It is his duty to "consolidate all healthy forces 
and prevent shocks that could lead to a civil war." That is quite a 
threat to toss about, something no candidate in New Hampshire has got 
around to. In the past few months Mr. Yeltsin has got rid of those of 
his lieutenants identified with the reform movement. This greatly 
surprised those members of our State Department who rued the long 
interval back in 1991 during which Gorbachev was falling apart and 
U.S. policy refused to recognize the importance of Yeltsin. We did so 
only after that dramatic day in Red Square when Yeltsin defied the 
revolutionists and soon after was elected president.
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It was demoralizing to read the assessment of Yeltsin by Vyacheslav 
Kostikov, Yeltsin's former press secretary. "Power is his ideology," 
he said, "his concubine if you want, his lover -- and his passion. 
Everything that is beyond the fight for power concerns him much less." 
When that remark about Yeltsin was aired, Kostikov was instantly fired 
(he had been ambassador to the Vatican). Fifty years earlier he'd have 
been instantly executed. Even ten years ago he would have suffered 
something more resonant than dismissal from a diplomatic post.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are many contenders for the presidency of Russia, but the 
thinking in some quarters is that there will be a run-off between the 
two lead candidates, and that they will be Yeltsin and Gennadi 
Zyuganov. Now Mr. Zyuganov, formerly a provincial teacher, is running 
on the Communist Party ticket and is thought the probable victor.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It staggers the mind. Suppose that in Germany a politician were to run 
on the National Socialist Party ticket. He might say, "Let's see if 
this time around we can do it without killing the Jews, or invading 
France." Zyuganov being a very acute politician, it can't be said of 
him that he got tripped up into running as a Communist. As with 
Yeltsin, one can't know what this politician's internal designs or 
attachments or loyalties are. But Zyuganov proclaims his attachment to 
Communism, intending to persuade the Russians that much of the pain 
they now experience -- en route to a free society and a free market -- 
they didn't experience back then under Stalin and Brezhnev, when no 
one was ever fired from his job, prices were stable, and crime was at 
low tide. In December's parliamentary race Zyuganov faced a liberal 
challenger. At one of their encounters, posters were flaunted: 
"50,000,000 VICTIMS OF CIVIL WAR, COLLECTIVIZATION AND REPRESSION 
WOULD NOT VOTE FOR ZYUGANOV." He won handily.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The great revisionism is underway. It begins by closing the memory. 
Four years ago, 84 per cent of high-school students tested knew what 
the Gulag was. Today, only 34 per cent can tell you that the Gulag was 
that great charnel, the archipelago in which twenty million Russians 
were killed, either by execution squads, or starvation, or exposure. 
Such historical tablelands, when brought to the attention of the 
Communist candidate for President, are shrugged off as incidents of 
yesteryear. "We can't answer for the mistakes of the past."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What is lost sight of is the primary finding of history in the matter 
of the Communist approach to government. It is that the cruelty, the 
repression, the economic sclerosis are an organic part of the whole. 
When Gorbachev authorized glasnost his critics proved absolutely 
correct, that glasnost would need to be repealed, or else that it 
would bring on the dissolution of the Communist enterprise, because 
free speech and Communism are irreconcilable. Yeltsin is already 
moving toward economic interventionism, and in his pursuit of power 
will almost certainly go further. The Communists in China are 
experimenting with economic freedom carefully sequestered, but their 
fear of its leverage on civil rights brings them to furious 
exhibitions of power and threat; because experience teaches that 
economic freedom requires a measure of personal freedom. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So, after all of this, the next President of Russia might be a 
Communist. What will be his attitude toward the liberated republics? 
We know what the position is of Zhirinovsky, the hero of the super 
nationalists: bring them all back. If that were accomplished, we would 
be facing a Communist leader of a new Soviet Union and wondering, 
quite reasonably, whether it would be thought new for so very long.

<title>Buckley: 'Ideology' On Our Mind -- 2/20/96</title>

<h2>
'Ideology' On Our Mind
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
buckley
.html">
William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
The point has been made, most specifically by Washington Post 
columnist David Broder, that the principal candidates for President 
shrink from "ideology." Thus Mr. Clinton separates himself from the 
Gephardt wing of the Democratic Party, and Senator Dole allows a 
certain amount of water to pass between him and Newt Gingrich. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The whole matter of ideology both vexes and enlightens political 
thought. The word is used differently in political discourse. The 
average voter will seek some consistency, or appearance of 
consistency, in a candidate's platform. The philosopher scorns 
ideology because too often it overwhelms reason, prudence, philosophy. 
The word was French and came out of the crucible of the French 
Revolution, which was the bloody complement of the American 
Revolution. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Senator Phil Gramm has generally been considered the most consistent 
of the conservatives running for the Presidency this year. If you 
believe A, that government activity ought not to replace non-
government activity except when required, you will believe B, that the 
government should not run the local pizza parlor. Ideology is a body 
of ideas reflecting the social needs and aspirations of an individual, 
a group, a class, or a culture (American Heritage Dictionary). But 
ideology is also "a set of doctrines or beliefs" that form the basis 
of a political, economic, or other system. If your position on a 
political question derives from a doctrine, then you are committed to 
subordinating your political position to your doctrinal position. 
Otherwise, you tend to wobble. Some wobbling is an aspect of political 
opportunism -- Senator Gramm in Iowa did not criticize federal 
subsidies of the ethanol program, which is a relic of the Department 
of Energy's extravagances. Sometimes it is an extra-ideological 
deference to reality (let the Federal Government help Los Angeles 
after its earthquake). 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But then we begin to line up other political questions, to be 
scrutinized ideologically. And it is here that the word "presumption" 
is useful. If you believe A -- that the government should stay out of 
the way -- you believe this either dogmatically or empirically. Was it 
right to intervene in Somalia? No, if the undertaking was designed to 
transform Somalian culture -- we should know that this can't be done; 
we tried and gave up making the world safe for democracy. Yes, if the 
single objective was to prevent mass starvation. Presumptively, stay 
out. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What about tariffs? Long ago, conservative doctrine shaped up in favor 
of free trade. This was, indeed, an extension of anti-government 
doctrine. A tariff is a tax paid by one American for the benefit of 
another American. But it is more than that, because it denies to the 
American consumer the advantage of competitive bidding, and 
derivatively deprives the foreigner of the wherewithal to patronize 
American production. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What about educational vouchers? Conservatives will in almost every 
situation honor the supremacy of the consumer over the regulator, so 
that if Mrs. Jones wants that school for her child, not the public 
school, the conservative would seek to expedite the choice. . . . Is 
that question ideologically related to school prayer? Yes, it is: the 
state should not intrude its wishes, or its restrictions, in the 
culture of free men, freely associating with one another. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Immigration? National independence? The state is by no means useless, 
as the anarchists insist. The state is a "natural" institution, and 
exercises its authority in matters that relate to the commonweal when 
these are clearly national concerns. The flow of immigration into a 
country is self-evidently the proper concern of the state inasmuch as 
only its agents can say Yes or No at the border. And the traffic needs 
to be regulated because there is a greater demand than supply. Mr. Fox 
Butterfield finished his memorable book on Communist China by quoting 
one Chinese who said that if the means to do so could be found, every 
Chinese would go to America to live. "Even the lamp posts would go." 
And sovereignty asserts a recognition that the world has yet to see 
(or even envision) a cultural unity that combines in acceptable 
priorities what we have called the American proposition.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So, Mr. Clinton edges away from ideologues in his own party (every 
problem is a state problem, and every dollar earned is forfeit to the 
state's agenda), and Senator Dole tries to shape an ideologically 
lucid opposition that appeals both to voters whose dogma is 
conservative, and to those whose inclinations are conservative. It is 
tough going, as much an art as a discipline.

<title>Buckley: Buchanan And the GOP -- 2/23/96</title>

<h2>
Buchanan And the GOP
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
buckley
.html">
William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
The New Hampshire event throws light primarily on Pat Buchanan even 
though, at only a point or two ahead of Senator Dole, his victory was 
nominal. The exhilaration was there, bringing to mind that of Senator 
Eugene McCarthy in 1968 when even though he did not defeat the sitting 
President, he came close enough (at 42 per cent) to electrocute Lyndon 
Johnson. A few weeks later, Johnson announced that he would not run 
for re-election. What has the Buchanan vote in New Hampshire told his 
own party?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is not instantly clear, because many of his positions are also 
held by other contestants. Steve Forbes is not the original flat-tax 
man, but he is the flat tax's primary champion -- Buchanan, with this 
or the other modification, agrees. On turning functions over to the 
states and, where possible, to individuals, Buchanan's position is 
also that of Lamar Alexander. Senator Dole took a strong stand against 
the degeneracy of Hollywood and so pleased the social conservatives, 
to whom Mr. Buchanan speaks eloquently. Buchanan is isolated from the 
others on two matters, one specific, the other general. He would 
repeal the two treaties that commit us to free trade, NAFTA and GATT. 
And he would adopt an isolationist foreign policy. The other three 
would not. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And yet when Mr. Buchanan speaks of his candidacy he singles it out as 
entirely unique, a messianic episode. And there is a sense in which he 
is correct. These things are not up for arithmetical measurement. 
Suppose one reasonably predicted that on ten positions involving 
public issues, Buchanan and Alexander (or Dole) would vote the same 
way on eight. Does that make them in the long perspective 
indistinguishable?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The answer is, No. Because Buchanan is a figure whose persona 
overwhelms the political grid. In Houston in 1992 he declared that the 
United States was engaged in a war to the death between two cultures, 
the traditional and the countercultural. Many thought him correct (I 
do), but his tone was not that of Abraham Lincoln, but that of John 
Brown. The afflatus is historically distinguished and honored, and as 
often as not the prophet is martyred. He is seldom brought on, like 
Churchill, to act as leader. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is another question, a matter of public and moral psychology. 
There are those Americans (again, I include myself) who believe that 
the isolationist temptation, both politically and economically, is a 
temptation most fiercely to be avoided, since its implications can be 
lethal. Although I do not believe for one minute that, if he were 
President, Mr. Buchanan would actually rush to dismantle NATO (any 
more than I believe that if Dole were President he would immediately 
balance the budget), the fact is that Buchanan said exactly that. The 
go-it-alone insularity is reflected in his economic nostrum for 
demoralized American workingmen: Blame foreigners. Charge the Japanese 
10 per cent on imports, the Chinese 20 per cent. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The political conundrum looms, as such wise men as there are in 
Republican politics acknowledge one thing, namely that there would not 
be much point in nominating Pat Buchanan with the mission of 
dispossessing President Clinton, since that is inconceivable. Buchanan 
is a prophet, not a king. That being so, practical men will pause over 
how exactly to handle the phenomenon. The memory of George Wallace 
comes to mind. In 1968 his popular strength was critical: he more or 
less owned the South, and he had a large following among hardhats in 
the industrial Midwest. But the Democrats were moving sharply left 
just then and had no time for him or for conservative Democrats in 
general. He avenged himself by running as an independent candidate, 
securing 13.5 per cent of the vote, and ensuring the election of 
Richard Nixon. Wallace's followers voted Republican for the next 
twenty years.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The challenge is to detach from Buchanan that in his campaign which 
the Republican Party ought to concern itself with, and be grateful to 
him for giving it focus. Buchanan almost singlehandedly revitalized 
moral political sentiment on the matter of abortion. His call for a 
national acknowledgment of a common culture has as its symbol a vote 
against Bilingual America. His earnest suspicion of predatory 
government is repeated by other candidates, but they are toothless in 
their language by comparison. The sheer joy with which Buchanan takes 
his positions is -- a joy to hear. A long night with the master 
cheerleader. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It will end in a few weeks, and then Republicans need to hope that the 
idealistic imperative of replacing Mr. Clinton will generate the 
necessary poultices, and mobilize the common will; which requires 
reorienting America in the general direction fought for by Pat 
Buchanan.

<title>Presidential Patter</title>

<h2>Presidential Patter</h2>
</center>
<hr>
New York, July 11 
<p>
<p>
There were about twenty people -- mostly men, four women -- engaged
in myriad activities, including law, banking, journalism, the academy.  
They have in common a bond to the conservative political enterprise  
which, to a not inconsiderable degree, is affected by their resolutions.  
And the evening's extemporaneous subject matter was the presidential  
race. 
<p> 
The rubric called for direct speech, freed of any obligation to diplomatic  
protocol. In that spirit, one commentator confessed his sense of security  
with Senator Dole. "I feel comfortable with opportunists, because I  
always know what to expect." Dole, most agreed, is scheduled to be  
nominated, the beneficiary of a Republican tradition that consummates  
the nomination of the front-runner. 
<p>
Bush led in 1988 and of course in 1992, and was confirmed by the  
Republican Convention. Reagan led in 1980, Ford in 1976, Goldwater in  
1964. By contrast, the Democrats make way for relatively obscure  
candidates. The polls reported that 2 per cent of the American people  
knew, in January 1972, the name of George McGovern: six months later  
he was nominated for President. The polls in January 1976 recorded 3  
per cent of the public knew the name of Jimmy Carter, and 12 months  
later he was inaugurated President of the United States. 
<p>
Such arrivals of the star in the third act tend not to happen in the GOP.  
Accordingly, Mr. Dole would need to slip up, something in which he is  
practiced, but not something he has done in the past few months, during  
which his campaign has revealed near-perfect professional performance.  
Another commentator opined that Dole might well suffer during the  
campaign, when his age might become visible. FDR was able to  
campaign in 1944 as if whole in mind and body, but this is not so easily  
done any more with the ubiquitous television cameras. And even without  
a slip, there will be some heavy breathing in the voting booths at the  
prospect of sending to the White House a man who would be 73 when  
inaugurated, 77 at the turn of the century. 
<p>
A participant took the floor to pass along something he situated at least  
half way between rumor and fact. He had been told (needless to say, by a  
reliable source) that Colin Powell would figure heavily in the politics of  
1996. 
<p> 
Just to begin with, whoever gets the presidential nod, Powell is almost  
certain to be invited to run for Vice President. If indeed Mr. Dole gets  
the nomination, Powell will feel a very strong impulse to serve him as  
Vice President, on the grounds that it is all but inconceivable that Bob  
Dole would run for a second term. In other words, Colin Powell would  
be inaugurated as President in January of 2001. 
<p>
Now on this subject, the commentator went on, his word has it that  
Powell will, as scheduled, proceed to do his book tour during September  
and October. But at the end of the tour, he will make a declaration of  
principles addressed unambiguously to the political scene -- and that set  
of political principles will be unambiguously conservative. That act will  
immediately make him a presidential candidate unless he rules himself  
out, intending to accept the Vice Presidency with Dole. We need to  
remember about General Powell -- or to teach ourselves, if we did not  
know it -- that he is the most spellbinding political orator since Reagan.  
"No one else comes even close to his amalgam of dignity, self- 
deprecation, firmness, and hope.'' 
<p> 
Still, whoever it is will need to contend with Bill Clinton. An observer  
began by reciting the disqualifications of the incumbent. "Just to begin  
with, he seems to have repealed the public bias against adultery." On  
every important position he has taken conflicting stands. He is scorned  
by the rest of the world, manipulated by his own staff, arrested in his  
thinking by any visiting shaman. "Still . . . He has the powers of  
Houdini. Throw him in the trunk of the car with eight chains bound  
around him, toss the car into the ocean, and before you know it, he  
comes bobbing up to the surface.'' 
 <p>
Even now, the observer continued, Clinton is substantially up over his  
ratings of a few months ago, and it is by no means certain that he will be  
swamped by the Republican nominee. Anything can happen, which is  
bad news for the Republic, and there is no insurance policy written to  
cope with this contingency.

<title>WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE MIAs?</title>
</head>
<center>
<h2>What to do about the MIA's</h2>
</center>
<hr> 
<b>New York, July 14</b>
<p>
<p>
Representative Randy Cunningham of California was a navy pilot during  
the Vietnam War. He was shot down. In recalling those days, in  
Congress last week, he broke into tears as he spoke of American soldiers  
who had died in his arms. He said that the Vietnamese had killed  
American prisoners and were withholding evidence to that effect. His  
conclusion: The recognition of the government of Vietnam "is not a  
political issue for me. This is right and wrong." 
<p> 
It isn't easy to talk back to such as Mr. Cunningham, certainly not if one  
has had no such experience of imprisonment by the Vietnamese. But  
then Senator John McCain was five and a half years a prisoner who  
endured torture. So was it with Pete Peterson of Florida. Bob Kerrey of  
Nebraska wasn't a prisoner, but in pressing the goals of war he won the  
Congressional Medal of Honor. John Kerry of Massachusetts won a  
Silver Star. And these four legislators support the recognition of  
Vietnam. 
<p> 
Whatever one's conclusion in the matter, we need, on meditation, to  
reject the suggestion that this is a moral question. The recognition of de- 
facto governments is the American tradition. Cuba and North Korea are  
exceptions, and the question is, do we want Vietnam to continue as  
another exception? 
<p> 
Here are the unspoken points in the controversy. 
<p>
1. There are no Americans alive who were put down as "missing in  
action.'' How do we know this? By the application of common sense.  
Since any live American soldier, captured between 1966 and 1975,  
surely wishes to return, why would he be kept in Vietnam? 
 <p>
If the Vietnamese kept hinting that a hundred Americans -- let alone  
1,618 Americans -- were going to arrive on a Boeing 747 the day after  
the United States handed over a billion dollars or whatever, the story of  
the MIAs would be comparable to the story of the Cubans caught by  
Castro during the Bay of Pigs invasion, or the Americans held hostage  
by Iran in 1979. Nothing is more useless than a dead hostage, and for  
that reason talk about the "whereabouts" of the MIAs should be  
restricted to talk about where they are buried. 
<p> 
2. If they are buried. Stories about the ferocity of the Vietnamese are not  
exaggerated, and when Congressman Cunningham is reduced to tears  
recollecting what the Vietnamese did, we can reasonably assume that his  
memory is exact. The Vietnamese killed a number of American  
prisoners. As a matter of fact, Americans killed some Vietnamese  
prisoners. And Americans killed a great many Vietnamese women and  
children in air raids. Wars animate the dark side of human nature, and  
although there is a difference between dropping a bomb on Dresden and  
executing soldiers at Katyn, no combating army is at all times governed  
by the models endorsed by international conventions. The American  
officer in charge of the Andersonville prisoner-of-war camp a century  
ago was hanged after the war because of his treatment of prisoners,  
13,000 of whom died. He was a Confederate captain, and his victims  
were American Unionists. We can't hang the malefactors in Vietnam  
because we lost the war. The short of it is that the Vietnamese don't  
know where all their victims were buried any more than the Argentines  
know where their victims -- dating back only 25 years -- were buried, in  
part because many of them were dropped from airplanes into the sea. 
<p> 
3. The Vietnamese government in recent months has been here and there  
cooperative in tracking down graves of dead American soldiers, but that  
government has not come forward with all the records it keeps. 
 <p>
Why is this so? 
 <p>
Almost certainly because those records would reveal that many  
Americans were in fact either killed, or permitted to die of starvation or  
of wounds. It should not surprise us that such records are tenaciously  
kept from view. And one wonders what is the nature of the satisfaction  
that bereaved wives and mothers would get from knowing that the man  
they loved, mysteriously missing since that day when he was captured,  
was in fact killed not in combat, but in detention? What would we have  
accomplished except the revival of bitterness and rage? And if we are  
dealing with the psychological question alone, do we really help the  
survivor by extinguishing hope, even hope forlorn? Would it satisfy those  
who have made all but a lifelong mission in search of her, to find the  
bones of Amelia Earhart?

<title>MURDER DOWN</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>MURDER DOWN?</h2>
</center>
<hr>
 New York, July 18 
<p>
<p>
The headline was wonderfully reassuring to this part of the world.  
"Murder Rate Plunges in New York City." There are corollary decreases  
in other crime -- robberies down 22 per cent, auto theft down 25 per  
cent. The question arises: Is this a statistical blip? If not -- if it is a  
genuine trend downward -- what are its causes? More jails? Less crack  
cocaine? A dulling of the criminal spirit? 
<p>
The optimists should read the essay in the July Atlantic Monthly by  
Adam Walinsky. For that matter, so should the pessimists. It is an  
eloquent and heavily informed overview of what has happened in the  
past three decades, and Mr. Walinsky wonders why America permitted it  
to happen. Everyone deplores the high rate of crime but there is nothing  
resembling a true mobilization to combat it. 
<p>
Here are the salient figures. In the 1960s, for every violent crime  
committed we had 3.3 police officers. In 1993, for every police officer  
there were 3.4 violent crimes. Consider New Haven, Connecticut. In  
1990, with its population down 14 per cent from 1960, its robberies had  
increased more than 100 times, or 10,000 per cent. In this perspective,  
the reduction of crime in New York is, however welcome, a mere fillip.  
And the figures on police stretch out to less than one-tenth the effective  
police power of thirty years ago. ". . . in another formulation, each police  
officer today must deal with 11.45 times as many violent crimes as his  
predecessor of years gone by." 
 <p>
We have a half-million police officers, and the proposal in the crime bill  
of Mr. Clinton was an extra one hundred thousand. How many  
policemen would we need to add in order to restore the same balance as  
in 1960 of police to violent crimes? Five million. 
<p>
Are we making any strides in that direction? Only in the private sector.  
One and one-half million security officers protect corporations, private  
residential areas, shopping malls. Good. But a lot of people spend their  
time outside privately protected areas, like the overwhelming majority of  
the American people. The Department of Justice estimates that 83 per  
cent of all Americans will be victims of violent crime at least once in  
their lives; about a quarter, victims of three or more violent crimes. 
<p>
Two out of five killers, Mr. Walinsky advises us, are undetected. These  
missing killers commit what the trade calls "stranger murders." The  
notion that crime is overwhelmingly a matter of passion is simply no  
longer arguable. And the chances of the stranger murderer getting away  
are 80 per cent. Walinsky quotes a New York Times description of Omar  
Rosario going to work in a grocery store, whose previous owner was  
murdered. "Rosario prepares for work by donning a bulletproof vest and  
sliding a 9-millimeter semi-automatic into his waistband. When a young  
man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the store, Mr. Rosario  
takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the pocket of his pants, his  
finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets him see the gun in his  
hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young man pulls a gun, he  
will be killed.''' 
<p> 
That's one way to go, but it hasn't had a large effect. In the last ten years,  
twice as many Americans were killed by strangers as were on the  
battlefield during the ten years we fought in Vietnam. In the black  
community the statistics are dire: One out of every 21 black men is  
killed, double the rate of American servicemen in the Second World  
War. "The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history  
but of this generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of  
government to create a welfare system that began the destruction of black  
family life. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality,  
celebrated license, and glorified fecklessness." 
<p> 
Adam Walinsky has for many years advocated a Police Corps, an ROTC  
that would offer four-year college scholarships to young people in return  
for four years of police service following their graduation. This is not an  
expenditure from which the Contract crowd should shrink. To begin  
with, it is to confirm the most solemn obligation of government, which is  
to provide for domestic security. "President Clinton has requested $261.4  
billion for defense against foreign enemies who killed fewer than a  
hundred Americans in all of last year. It would be silly to suggest that  
the Federal Government should not or cannot spend an eighth as much --  
2 per cent of even a shrunken federal budget -- to defend the nation  
against domestic enemies who killed more than 10,000 people who were  
strangers to them in 1994, and who will surely kill more in every year  
that lies ahead."

<title>Why Not ID?</title>
</head><center>
<h2>Why Not ID?</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
 NEW YORK, JULY 25
<p>
Thirty years ago the philosopher/strategist James Burnham included a 
chapter in his book Suicide of the West in which he undertook to list 
the stands in public policy that distinguish the American conservative 
from the American liberal. For instance? Capital punishment: most 
conservatives are in favor of it, most liberals against. Gun control, 
the other way around. Many of the dividing points had to do with 
aspects of foreign policy during the Cold War, no longer relevant. If 
Mr. Burnham were alive and writing today no doubt he'd have included 
in his list strategic anti-missile defense. There is a Grand Canyon 
that divides conservative and liberal opinion on that subject.
<p>
We paleos (for "paleolithic conservatives": i.e., those of us who were 
conservative beginning way back in past geological eras) were weaned 
in a kind of anti-cyber, anti-computer tradition. Mr. Burnham listened 
with instinctive approval to a classmate who initiated the idea of a 
chain-letter from one friend to two friends to four friends to sixteen 
friends urging a quiet mutiny against numerical identification. The 
idea was always to misplace one digit in anything that requires 
absolutely accurate disclosure. A kind of quiet sabotage of the 
computer age, was the dream. If enough people wrote 123465 where 
123456 was the correct code, then the mighty house of Mainframe would 
come tumbling down.
<p>
It is in fidelity to that tradition that so many conservatives oppose 
any move toward an identification number. Professor Thomas Sowell of 
the Hoover Institution has written that "nothing polarizes the 
political Left and Right like the idea of a national identity card." 
The Nazis and the Communists and indeed the South Africans required an 
ID. Isn't that reason enough for free governments to shrink at the 
thought of it?
<p>
Not in my view. In the past three weeks I have three times been asked 
to give my Social Security number. Why? Presumably because no two 
people have the same Social Security number. When we were in the army 
and desired to get free postage, we were required to write our serial 
number on the envelope. When we travel abroad we are required to hand 
over our passports, each one individually numbered. In many situations 
the requirement is to show your driver's license, preferably in states 
in which your picture also appears on that license.
<p>
What then is the reason for such heated opposition to an 
identification number, as has been proposed by various congressmen 
anxious to do something about illegal immigration? The idea, as we 
understand it, is to develop an ID which can't be violated by the 
owner or duplicated by a black marketeer. Presumably what then happens 
is that the young man who asks for a job in a restaurant or at a 
construction firm is asked (under obligation of law) to show his ID. 
If he can't come up with it, he is deemed to be illegal, and doesn't 
get hired.
<p>
What's wrong with that? "Control is the name of the game for 
liberals," Professor Sowell writes, "even when they call it 
'compassion.' A national identity card would not only permit even 
greater government snooping into people's private lives, the 
information gathered would almost inevitably lead to more laws forcing 
more people to do more things the way the politicians want them done. 
It is a down payment on totalitarianism." Mr. Sowell sees a tunnel 
ahead, and the light at the end of it is the complete submission by 
the individual to the government.
<p>
We should concede this, namely that in totalitarian societies an ID is 
absolutely essential. The contrapositive, however, is not justified -- 
that every society that has an ID will become a totalitarian society. 
As noted, already there is an ID of sorts, done by Social Security. As 
a weapon against illegal immigration it is not reliable because it is 
very easy to get a Social Security card. But if a) it is a legitimate 
goal to regulate immigration, then b) the means to do this effectively 
should be there, and c) it would not appear to make sense to deny the 
government instruments that are not inherently cruel or indecent. To 
authorize an ID that merely proves you are who you say you are is not 
the same thing as to authorize a government enema or truth serum.
<p>
On such matters one thinks of George Gilder, the American conservative 
bard of the computer, whose threnodies remind us how much we owe to 
the computer, not least that it enables us, without further ado, to 
establish that we are Americans, entitled to the rights guaranteed us 
under the Constitution.

<title>The Susan Smith Case</title>
</head>
<center><h2>The Susan Smith Case</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
NEW YORK, JULY 28
<p>
<p>
The brother of Susan Smith asked the jurors what would be the point of 
sentencing Mrs. Smith to death -- hasn't there been enough tragedy in 
her family already? That statement did not resonate very widely 
because Mrs. Smith's family comprised the two boys she murdered, and 
an ex-husband who had already told the jury he thought she should be 
executed. And of course the point logically arises: If there is a law 
in South Carolina specifying execution for capital offenses, what 
capital offenses are we going to sub-specify as especially appropriate 
for execution?
<p>
Well of course no one disputes the sheer horror of the means by which 
Mrs. Smith elected to kill her children. Under the circumstances, the 
defense needed to go in a different direction from what the defense 
has done with O. J. Simpson. It needed to plead with the jury the 
awful aspects of her own life.
<p>
Newspaper readers are familiar with the details: the suicide of her 
father when she was 6, seduction by her stepfather when she entered 
her teens, a marriage that resulted in two sons followed by a divorce 
followed by a love affair with her boss alongside a love affair with 
her boss's son coextensive with sex with her stepfather. The reason 
for all of this, the defense explained, is the trauma of the suicide 
of her father and the fear she felt that to break away from her 
stepfather would be in the nature of renewing the wound that had left 
her fatherless at 6 -- and how are we doing, ladies and gentlemen of 
the jury, have we got you in the Menendez mood? You do remember the 
Menendez brothers, and how convincing it was that they really felt 
they had to empty their shotguns at their mother and father?
<p>
It pays, if only as an exercise, to credit the teleology of Susan 
Smith's mental development. Let us assume that the suicide of her 
father led her compulsively to submit to sex with her stepfather. Let 
us suppose that that driving compulsion to love copiously led her to 
leave her husband and take to her bed her boss, and then his son; that 
her anxiety for the continued sexual devotion of the son led her to 
interpret his statement that he would not marry a woman and take on 
the burden of two children to the perfectly logical conclusion that 
the children were an insufferable burden: that that led her 
compulsively to strap the two impediments onto the back seat of the 
car, and let it slide into the lake. A quite natural sense of self-
protection caused her to tell police of a black abductor who at 
gunpoint had whisked the children away. And then after nine days, as 
the circumstantial evidence tightened about her, she began to descry a 
noose. At that point she confessed.
<p>
Now the refinement of the McNaghten defense, which requires the 
prosecution to establish that the defendant knew the difference 
between right and wrong, would not appear to have applied. Mrs. Smith 
acknowledged to her ex-husband that she was "sorry" she hadn't 
accepted his offer to take the boys home with him.
<p>
What was fought over, in the jury deliberations, is really the 
question of capital punishment. 1) The gravity of the offense was 
established. 2) The defendant's knowledge that what she did was wrong 
wasn't doubted. In which case, 3) shouldn't she be sentenced to death?
<p>
The risk in capital prosecutions was of course highlighted by the 
Menendez verdict. The law, roundly stated, tells us that you may not 
kill another person except in self-defense. The Menendez brothers had 
no such excuse, but they were got off by a lawyer who mesmerized the 
jury into rogue theories of psychological compulsions.
<p>
Such arguments go to eristic legal lengths. Suppose we begin with the 
simple postulate that murder is aberrational behavior. Then the 
question -- under the handling of defense lawyers -- becomes: What 
caused such behavior? Mean parents? Suicidal fathers? Cruelty? Sex? 
Fear? -- the list is infinite because the postulate is fixed. It is 
that if somebody is murdered, it has to be that the murderer departed 
from the moral fixes that restrain other human beings. Accordingly the 
quest is for the cause of the misbehavior, and the only penological 
reason to keep the murderer in jail is to prevent him from doing it 
again.
<p>
It became, really, that all over again, a fight over capital 
punishment. "What happened to Michael and Alex is a tragedy," said the 
defense. "To strap Susan in a chair and send 2,000 volts into her in 
the name of justice -- "
<p>
He was interrupted by the prosecution, who reminded him that more 
humane means of execution had been authorized by the State of South 
Carolina. But the State of South Carolina might just as well abolish 
capital punishment now that Susan Smith has been spared.

<title>Newt Draws Fire</title>
</head>
<center>
<i>New York, July 28, 1995</i><hr>
<h2>Newt Draws Fire</h2>
<p>
<a href ="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></a>
</center><hr>
<p>
<p> 
 

<p>
<p>
It's interesting how many left feeling insecure when the subject of Newt Gingrich comes up. Dan Quayle, Spiro Agnew, Jesse Helms -- they can be handled with that equanimity that mainlines its way onto critics who are confident they are peering down on their targets. Newt Gingrich doesn't work for them in quite that way. For one thing he has a very advanced academic degree; for another, he is politically defter than most of his critics, and nothing generates hurt like yet one more primary victory by Tricky Dick. Gingrich stitched together a year ago the unthinkable, a proposed legislative agenda for a Republican Congress. The whole world laughed at such presumption and the next 
thing we knew, the House of Representatives became Republican. They stopped making certain kinds of jokes about FDR after 100 days, but in the case of Newt, the need to laugh begins to sound like the aristocracy in the Winter Palace, continuing to twit while the Revolution gathered outdoors. 
<p>
Consider Maureen Dowd of the New York Times. Her recent assault on Gingrich was ostensibly triggered by his confession that he was not schooled in foreign policy (he had blurted out that Taiwan should be recognized diplomatically). But Miss Dowd doesn't conceal the totality of her concern over the Speaker. She entitled her piece "The Loss of the Dodo"; led off by remarking that Newt was "sickeningly" cute; and ended by confessing her "distress" at the prospect of "the Speaker 
frolicking in the woods with a bunch of guys in sheets and dresses."
<p>
The "cute" business was a reaction to Mr. Gingrich's having told a visiting witness that she was welcome to "come see my dinosaur." The reference is to a facsimile skull kept in Mr. Gingrich's office, which wouldn't strike most people as "cute," so long as the addict stops short of dinosaur figures on his stationery or calls for a National Dinosaur Day.
<p>
As to the foreign-policy statement (Why don't we just recognize Taiwan?), in the same issue that carried Miss Dowd's column, the Times ran a major story about Taiwan and the loss of national identity by its people. Taiwan is large enough and important enough to warrant recognition, but we have here the problem of, "If you had some ham we could have a ham sandwich, if I had some bread" -- neither Taiwan nor China will affirm the obvious, which is that modern Taiwan is as much a zone of modern China as Algeria is a zone of France.
<p>
Then there is the frolicking in the woods. 
<p>
Miss Dowd noted that Mr. Gingrich would spend the weekend at the Bohemian Grove, "the exclusive men's club in northern California. . . The camp is a saturnalia of juvenilia, with a lot of old white rich 
guys running around naked and in sheets, costumed as Druids. They drink dawn-to-dusk gin fizzes, relieve themselves on redwoods, and put on theatricals where they dress up like women." 
<p>
Well yes, but if you are playing the part of a woman in a theatrical, what should you dress like? Miss Dowd might as well have written that she doesn't understand why the people in the Metropolitan Opera chorus go around clutching spears. 
<p>
About five years ago, CBS's Leslie Stahl did an interview with me about women joining the Century Association. A few minutes into the discussion she interrupted herself. "Would you be willing to talk 
about the Bohemian Club?"
<p>
Well, I said, it isn't something we're supposed to talk about. . . .
<p>
"Well," Miss Stahl pressed, "what about this business of going around naked?"
<p>
I lowered my voice. "In the years I've been going to the Bohemian Club," I whispered, "I have seen men naked only in the shower, and now I'll tell you something in confidence." Her eyes hungered for my 
revelation. The camera whirred. "The Admissions Committee of the Bohemian Grove does not like to admit to membership people who shower with their clothes on." Miss Stahl simply smiled, gamely. 
<p>
Did Maureen Dowd believe that men in the Grove go about naked? No, she did not. Two days before her story appeared she telephoned an old friend, an ex-member of the Club, who told her the naked business was sheer fantasy -- "It just doesn't happen." Perhaps Miss Dowd thought to be cute by perpetuating the legend, and in a way she succeeded, and I'd even go so far as to deny that she was at this point sickeningly cute. 
<p>
Saturnalia? Those in the Bohemian Grove who drink gin fizzes all day long (I know of two) drink gin fizzes from dawn to dusk wherever they are. A drunkard need not bother to travel to California in order to indulge his habit. But then Miss Dowd would rather spice up her column than report facts, 
proving only that the antagonism to Newt conquers all, even if it does not excuse all.

<h2>What About The 'Overclass'?</h2>
<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><i>William F. Buckley Jr. </i></a><hr>
</center>
<p>
<p>


<p>
<p>
The author Michael Lind was interviewed on the (indispensable) MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour and was questioned about some of the theses of his book The Next American Nation [reviewed this issue, p. 60]. One of these is that the United States is headed toward a "Brazilianization" 
of society, by which Mr. Lind meant that the affluent class is self-perpetuating and is sealing itself off from the rest of the country. How? By sending its sons and daughters to the most privileged 
colleges, taking refuge in private country clubs and mansions, intermarrying, and so on. The greatest entitlement in the hands of this overclass, said Mr. Lind, is the institution of the "legacy" in 
the primary colleges and universities. 
<p>
Interviewer David Gergen came up with a half-dozen super-prominent men in American political life who had not attended the fancy colleges. Furthermore, 45 per cent of top chief executives either dropped out of college or graduated from a second- or third-category college. How did 
Mr. Lind account for that? Oh. Well, he wasn't saying that meritocracy was dead in America, in fact it is more pronounced than it was in the nineteenth century. It just isn't meritocratic enough.
<p>
It is a very old complaint, that which is leveled at the wealthy and their progeny. It certainly attracted the attention of Andrew Carnegie, who favored a 100 per cent inheritance tax. The current 
federal estate tax is very high -- 60 per cent; 80 to 85 per cent on money left to grandchildren, beyond the generation-skipping allowance. The federal estate tax doesn't yield all that much revenue (the 1995 
estimate is $15.6 billion, or 1.2 per cent of total federal receipts) and definitive studies haven't been done -- because they can't be done -- to measure the economic impact of the high taxes. We do not know how many industrious and inventive Americans switch into overdrive instead of continuing to chug-chug up the hill to accumulate more to leave their children and grandchildren. The avoidance of taxes is a primal urge, like sex and patriotism and religion, and lighthearted redistributionists are well counseled to be aware of this, though when the jacobinical fever rages, people don't care whether they are stifling production with their taxes. All that they care about is that 
the Haves shall have less. 
<p>
On the matter of the "legacy" to entry into fancy colleges, Mr. Lind is on insecure ground again. It is true that at the margin, the practice goes on. But it is very far from being comprehensive. Twenty-
five years ago the admissions director of Yale University got into serious trouble with the alumni after several years' application of what very nearly amounted to an anti-legacy policy, during which he 
reduced to 13 per cent (from about 18) the sons of Eli admitted.
<p>
The question was raised, For what reason are alumni expected to give funds to their alma mater? Yes, perhaps, as a measure of gratitude for education and experiences received. And yes, because they wish their alma mater to continue to retain fine scholars. But first-rate scholars are going to be teaching somewhere -- they don't have to teach at any one university. At about that time (the Sixties), 
Professor C. Vann Woodward, the distinguished Southern historian, was lured away from Johns Hopkins by Yale at considerable expense. This move did not further "education": the kids are as bright at Johns Hopkins as at Yale; and anyway, professors at that level are hired primarily to write books and teach graduate students.
<p>
To contribute to Yale to make it possible for Vann Woodward to move there traces to a perfectly understandable pride, tribal in character, in maintaining in first-rate condition the university to which the 
alumnus hopes his son or daughter will one day be admitted. Mr. Lind's thesis isn't really persuasive unless somebody comes up with Animal House students congestively present at Yale or Harvard or Stanford. That won't happen because such folk don't, pace Lind, get admitted. No alumnus is going to yell, whatever his contributions to his alma mater, if his son is turned down after coming in with a combined SAT score in three digits.
<p>
An old bark, an old tree, bringing to mind that the problem in Brazil is that they don't behave as we do.

<title>Hiroshima -- Happy Birthday?</title>
</head>
<center><h2>Hiroshima -- Happy Birthday?</center></h2>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
William F. Buckley Jr, New York August 4th
<p>
Harry Truman was not an ambiguist, just to begin with. And in any 
case, important declarations are usually summary. "I do," is all that 
is necessary in answer to the question, "Do you take this man for your 
lawfully wedded husband?" When asked for final approval to drop the 
atomic bomb over Hiroshima, Harry Truman, in Potsdam, scribbled out in 
longhand, "Suggestion approved. Release when ready." It seems a 
millennium since the idiomatically similar order was given by Admiral 
Dewey to the captain of his flagship at the Battle of Manila Bay in 
1898: "You may fire when you are ready, Gridley." Truman authorized 
the non-platonic beginning of the nuclear age, at the convenience of 
the commander of a bomber squadron on the 39-square-mile island of 
Tinian.
<p>
Time magazine did a good job last week in describing the elements of 
the contest between East and West that was finally detonated at Pearl 
Harbor, and a harrowing account of the terrible bloodiness of the 
Pacific war and of the breathless interval between the bomb's falling 
at Nagasaki and the quiet-spoken words of the Emperor Hirohito, 
besought by a cabinet divided between surrender and suicide. He 
elected to surrender.
<p>
Books have been written and prayers for divine guidance said to 
examine the morality of the bomb. If it is true that the intentions of 
the perpetrator are the final determinants of moral rectitude, then 
Truman is clearly blameless. He had weighed reports of projected 
American casualties in an invasion of Japan; estimates ranged between 
thirty thousand and a half-million dead and wounded. The same 
strategists projected Japanese casualties at many times that number, 
and even as Truman thought about the question -- before even the trial 
bomb at Alamogordo had established that Little Boy (Hiroshima) and Fat 
Man (Nagasaki) would indeed work their devastation -- we were 
routinely proceeding with our concentrated bombing of Japanese cities. 
Over eighty thousand were killed in the firebombings of Tokyo even as, 
a few months earlier, we had in three waves killed almost as many 
Germans in Dresden with the saturation bombings.
<p>
Did Harry Truman give sufficient thought to alternatives? There was 
the possibility of encouraging an earlier intervention against Japan 
by the Soviet army. There was the possibility of amending the terms of 
surrender sharply enough to affect the thinking of the bitter-enders 
in the Japanese military. The answer to these questions can't be 
given, not because the alternatives weren't presented to Truman, but 
because we don't know to what extent they captured his attention. We 
had only just conquered Okinawa, with a loss of 12,500 American 
servicemen. A national poll showed 90 per cent of Americans supporting 
in effect unconditional surrender. As far as Truman was concerned, we 
should give him the benefit of the doubt: the nuclear bomb was simply 
the next weapon in line. We had traveled, in Truman's lifetime, from 
biplanes to B-29s. Why cavil at a single bomb that could effect the 
same damage as a thousand bombers?
<p>
The soul-searching came later. It required centuries to mobilize 
civilized opinion against slavery and against torture. It is not 
finally settled even now on capital punishment. Nor is it on nuclear 
weaponry as a deterrent, but then of course in order to deter, nuclear 
weapons need to threaten. A civilized scholar very close to several 
Presidents once observed to me that if the Soviet nuclear flotilla had 
actually launched, he would have seen no purpose in counselling the 
President to launch our own: what had been there as a deterrent, 
designed to be conclusive, hadn't worked -- so why kill 150 million 
Russians? No one of course will ever know whether such reasoning would 
have stayed the hand of a U.S. President. It sufficed that Soviet 
leaders did not rule out nuclear retaliation: whereupon nuclear 
stalemate was born. It had a long life.
<p>
It does surprise that the evangelistic energy now spent on the horrors 
of Hiroshima does not bear little buds that would encourage the 
development of defensive means to intercept the hypothetical nuclear 
bomb of tomorrow. For reasons quite impossible to understand, those 
most transfixed by the horrors of Hiroshima are most unconcerned by, 
or even hostile to, any effort to accost not the evil in men's minds 
and nature -- perhaps because this is not possible -- but the weapons 
such men can deploy.

<h2>Nightmare Time</h2>
<p>

<hr></center>
<p>
The sudden thrust by the Croatians at the expense of neighboring Serbs tells us not very much that there is armed life in the area and that finally something stoexcept pped what was appearing to be a Blitzkrieg by Bosnian Serbs. Their objective has been, for four years, Sarajevo.  Collateral triumphs have been the discrediting of the United Nations, NATO, and U.S. foreign policy.
<p>
The break in America from the isolation of yesteryear was the result of the reduction from thirty days to thirty minutes of the traversability of the space that had shielded America from Europe for four centuries. The principled arguments -- revisionist but nonetheless convincing -- against our entry into the First World War were decreasingly safe when used to oppose our entry into the Second 
World War. It is of course a hackneyed irony to remark that Sarajevo triggered the First World War and is now a point of conflagration that could trigger, if not a world war, a collapse of the scaffolding we 
hoped to build in the postwar years. 
<p>
The primary cause of disillusion with world-mindedness after the Second World War was the diplomatic defeats we suffered in Europe and then in Asia. Having joined the Allies in a mission initiated to restore sovereignty to Poland, we were maneuvered into the totalitarian desolation of much of Europe under Stalin. At the other end of the world, having triumphed over imperialist Japan we stood by helpless against the Communization of China under Mao Tse-tung. To say the least, this damaged the sensibilities of those Americans who dreamed of making the world safe for democracy. But a further and protracted jolt was the formation of the United Nations. Not that the idea of an international body was wrong, but that the UN became almost overnight the diplomatic ganglion of hypocrisy. There the Soviet Union dominated the votes of the Third World. After jubilation over the retreat of British imperialism in India, Americans stood shocked and aghast when Pandit Nehru refused to condemn the Soviet tanks that gunned down students in Budapest who sought a few scraps of liberty. 
The United Nations, in short, didn't work, and indeed sheltered the most impudent rhetorical hypocrisies in diplomatic history. 
<p>
After the Nuremberg trials the civilized world seemed to be united on at least one proposition, namely that genocide would not again be tolerated. Well, it was tolerated. When it happened in Africa we 
managed discreet sighs and, in the closet, whispered that civilization had yet to reach certain parts of the world. But then with the end of Communism a refreshment of international idealism temporarily took 
over. The UN, for one thing, would no longer serve as an echo chamber for Soviet lies and hypocrisy. Then along came Yugoslavia, RIP.
<p>
There to the north, northeast, and west loomed the mighty power of Russia, Germany, France, and England. Diplomatic efforts to arrest ethnic cleansing crystallize as games concocted to engage the 
attention of students at war colleges. In the background geographically, in the foreground geopolitically, was the United States. On the one hand it was clearly the burden of Europe to handle 
the mess in Yugoslavia. On the other hand, we were the undisputed superpower, and it turned out that we could not breathe the requisite concern into our NATO allies. And so, month after month, year after 
year, nothing is done except that people kill each other and latent hostilities are stimulated. There is the Serb affinity for Russians and vice versa, the Western European historical affinity for Croatia. 
The Muslim world correctly questions whether there is any reliable concern in Europe for aggressions at its expense. The Greeks watch nervously at movement in the other Macedonia, and the Turks, however frequently they are reminded of their own historical excesses, let it be known that they are brothers of the Bosnians being killed, tortured, raped.
<p>
In New Jersey if year after year a county can't manage its own schools, Trenton takes the schools over. The metaphor is easily resisted: How exactly does NATO take over Belgrade? But that is the 
wrong approach in a century in which the question, How do we split an atom? was answered: We shall proceed to do so. 
<p>
The NATO enterprise is discredited. The Europeans are mired in their spiritual trough, and the feeling in America is, more and more: Two hot wars and one cold war are enough for one century. You figure it 
out.  Unhappily, history won't stand by to permit us our alienation. The reason we are entangled in Europe -- and in the Pacific -- is that we can't escape the consequences of  what happens there.

<title>Are States' Constitutions Unconstitutional?</title>

<br>
<h2>Are States' Constitutions Unconstitutional?</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><i><b>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
During the recess from Washington, our legislators have an opportunity 
to reflect a little, and it would not be time lost if they gave 
thought to a prayer amendment. There are several reasons to do this. 
One, the restoration of traditional authority for local schools; a 
second, the elucidation of a constitutional disfigurement done over 
the last generation by the Supreme Court; a third, to rebuke the 
Supreme Court for its fanatical misinterpretation of the First 
Amendment. <p>
But the question suddenly arises, Is a constitutional amendment 
necessary? When questioned early in the year about what had gone into 
the Contract with America, Newt Gingrich admitted that thought had 
been given to the prayer amendment but that since it required a two-
thirds majority, this was a challenge better put off until other 
problems had been coped with. The failure of the Balanced Budget 
Amendment (although by a single vote in the Senate) reminded us of the 
difficulty of amassing a two-thirds majority. It is therefore 
especially bracing to consider alternative means of accomplishing the 
same end, devised by the constitutional historian Harry Jaffa of the 
Claremont Institute.<p>
He reasons as follows. Forty-seven of our fifty states explicitly 
invoke the name of God in their own Constitutions. They vary in 
phrasing, but they are nowhere sectarian. By this is meant that the 47 
states in question nowhere cite God using denominational language. The 
President's home state of Arkansas, for instance, launches its 
constitution by saying, "We the people of the State of Arkansas, 
grateful to Almighty God for our civil and religious liberty, and 
desiring to perpetuate its blessings . . ." In Maine, the people 
acknowledge "with grateful hearts the goodness of the Sovereign Ruler 
of the Universe," while from Colorado we have the relatively Spartan 
intelligence that the people, "with profound reverence for the Supreme 
Ruler of the Universe," nevertheless authorize the election of Pat 
Schroeder to Congress. <p>
Suppose that a joint resolution of the Congress, requiring only simple 
majorities in both houses, were to declare that children in public 
schools might lawfully recite voluntary prayers employing only such 
acknowledgment of divine power and goodness as is present in their own 
state constitution, or in the constitution of any other state? The 
Supreme Court could go beyond fuming and raging over the ensuing 
resumption of prayer in the public schools only by pronouncing the 
constitutions of 47 states to be unconstitutional. It is a reasonable 
guess that the Court would want to stop short of any such declaration. <p>
And bear in mind that the state constitutions have provisions 
equivalent to the "no establishment" and "free exercise" clauses of 
the First Amendment. California, for instance, ordains that "Free 
exercise and enjoyment of religion without discrimination or 
preference are guaranteed. . . . The legislature shall make no law 
respecting an establishment of religion." And we bear also in mind 
that every enabling act by the Congress for the admission of a state 
to the Union since the Civil War has had the following provision: "The 
Constitution of [the state being admitted] shall always be republican 
in form and shall not be repugnant to the Constitution of the United 
States and the principles of the Declaration of Independence." <p>
These are freighted words in two senses. As regards the religious-
freedom clauses, we are reminded historically that the 13 states 
admitted to the Union since the Civil War were scrutinized by 
Congress, which in ratifying their constitutions affirmed that they 
were admissible under the U.S. Constitution. More, the invocation of 
the Declaration of Independence, as an instrument to which the 
constitution of the aspiring state must not be "repugnant," 
strengthens the viability of the Declaration, which of course speaks 
of the rights with which we have been "endowed by [our] Creator." Such 
rights are "unalienable" because they are fixed eternally in "the laws 
of nature and of nature's God." It is always reassuring to know that 
some element more majestic than the God of legal positivism looks 
after and approves of our liberties. <p>
So then it is up to Speaker Gingrich.<p>

<title>Jerry Garcia, RIP</title>

<i>New York, August 18</i>
<hr>
<h2>Jerry Garcia, RIP</h2><p>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><i><b>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
If I ever heard a song played by the Grateful Dead I wasn't aware of 
it. If I had been, I'd have pricked up my ears and listened real hard 
because I have a memory. It is of a young man who came to work at my 
shop. He had just graduated from Harvard, wanted to do some opinion 
journalism, and qualified for a summer internship that stretched into 
two or three years.<p>
It was toward the end of the decade of the Sixties that he drew me 
aside one day, after we had gone to press. He said that he had been to 
a concert by the Grateful Dead and that it was a wonderful experience, 
and that he would go again whenever the group was in reach, and he 
invited me to join him at one of the concerts, which I wish I had 
done. <p>
I have to suppose that, like so many others, I would have survived the 
experience without such harm as finally came to Jerry Garcia and, 25 
years before Garcia, to our young intern. He did his work, but with 
progressive listlessness. His editorial paragraphs had never been 
razor sharp but they had been trenchant and readable, and now they 
were murky.<p>
Things got worse, and now came the trappings, which were conventional. 
It began with sandals, then went in the usual direction, though I 
don't remember that he ran a ring through his ear. When an anniversary 
issue was planned for the magazine he suddenly demanded that his 
"generation" be represented, so I told him to go ahead and write what 
he thought would be a useful essay.<p>
I don't remember seeing it myself, but I was told not that it was 
unsuitable, or unfinished, or unprofessional, but that its meaning was 
impenetrable. At about that time an associate ten years older reported 
his (informed) opinion that our intern was going off the deep end. At 
a collegial staff lunch he once excused himself so abruptly as to 
provoke the melancholy conclusion that he had needed a quick jolt of 
whatever drug he was taking. One day he announced that he would be 
married, and soon brought in an addled flower child dressed as he 
dressed. One weekend they just faded away. A few years later we 
received formal invitations to a second marriage, to a South American. 
He went with his new bride to her country and taught English. In due 
course he sent us an article submission. It was potentially 
publishable but needed work, and the managing editor sent it back to 
him with recommended changes. We did not hear from him again, except 
after another interval of five years or so, when we learned he had 
married yet again, this time to a native, and gone off to live in the 
hills. Question before the house: Is Jerry Garcia in some way 
responsible for this?<p>
The issue of Newsweek that put Garcia on the cover quoted in huge type 
the words of a 21-year-old college student. "It's a free life when 
you're at a show. It's all about happiness. I'd just take my watch off 
and want time to stop." It isn't easy to rail against anyone who 
brings happiness, and one has to assume that many, perhaps the 
majority, of those who heard "shows" by the Grateful Dead achieved 
their highs without the use of intoxicants. But something unusual 
accounted for the young Americans, pictures of them reproduced in the 
days just gone by, exhibiting Dionysiac pleasure in their role as 
Deadheads. Exuberance finds its forms throughout the world and 
concentrates its energies on the young. But is the joy unconfined? 
Ought it to be?<p>
Jerry Garcia died only a week after leaving the Betty Ford Center. He 
is quoted as having said two years ago that, really, he needed to do 
something to restore his health, otherwise he would be dead, like "two 
years from now." He went on schedule, and is said to have died with a 
smile on his face, no doubt because he was a happy man but also 
because he made so many others happy. But he also killed, if that's 
the right word for such as our intern, a lot of people. And although 
he had a pulsating forum world wide for thirty years and knew from his 
own experience what his habits were doing to him, he never went public 
on it, not really. One has to suppose, sadly, that in his case, going 
public on his problem, extending a truly firm handshake to his 
legions, would have required the dramatic gesture of retiring from the 
stage. If he had done so, it would not have been wounding to those of 
us who were never exposed to Jerry Garcia's special intoxicant, but, 
if he had done so, how many would have had better prospects for 
health, love, and longer lives?<p>

<title>Where Does Fuhrman Take Us?</title>

<h2>Where Does Fuhrman take Us?</h2><p>

</center>
<hr>
<br>
One account analyzes the Mark Fuhrman situation as follows: If the 
exposure of the tapes comes in as the closing episode in the trial, 
the probability is high that the disgust and loathing for Detective 
Fuhrman (richly deserved) will provoke in the jury a sentiment 
extraneous to the question, Did O. J. kill his former wife and her 
companion? Instead, the analysis goes on, the jurors will ask 
themselves, How can we express our disgust? Well -- the analyst 
concludes -- by voting, Not Guilty.<p>
The prosecution will of course make an earnest, desperate attempt to 
situate the tapes in context. Marcia Clark will argue that Houdini 
himself could not have contrived to arrange the evidence against O. J. 
with which the prosecution has made its case. The chief of police in 
Los Angeles, Mr. Willie Williams, told a press conference that "it is 
inconceivable to believe that for this one murder 10, 20, 30, or 40 
people got together to plot against Mr. Simpson." Only Oliver Stone 
could stitch together a plot to do in O. J. that originated at two in 
the morning and matured with a bloody glove at his residence, and 
bloodstains that identified O. J., his ex-wife, and Mr. Goldman here 
and there along the route from the scene of the crime back to 
Simpson's residence.<p>
But the thinking at the moment is that the jury will waive matters 
that have dulled in memories of men and women who must be feeling as 
though they had been sentenced to perpetual isolation during a 
seemingly endless trial. Human sensibilities are as they are, and the 
jurors are not likely to blame the defense for their incarceration. 
The enemy will be the Establishment: the judge who ordained their 
isolation, the prosecution that droned on endlessly, and, above all, 
the Los Angeles Police Department, which retained in its ranks someone 
who -- if the tapes are to be believed -- lives in fury against the 
existence of blacks, women, homosexuals, and civil rights. <p>
It is mystifying what exactly were the objectives of Mr. Fuhrman in 
his recorded conversations with Laura Hart McKinny, the scholar at the 
North Carolina School of Arts, starting in 1985. He reported to her 
(according to one passage in the tapes) how on one occasion he and 
fellow officers handled four suspects. "We basically tortured them. We 
broke 'em. Their faces were just mush. They had pictures of the walls 
with blood all the way to the ceiling and finger marks of [them] 
trying to crawl out of the room." A messy business, handling suspects 
in that way. It required Mr. Fuhrman and his fellow law enforcers to 
clean themselves up with a garden hose. <p>
Now the Fuhrman narrative gives one pause. It does not surprise that 
here and there one comes upon sadists, whether in Los Angeles or in 
Gulag. The viewers of the Rodney King beating tend to reason, Why 
should we be surprised? Such evidently is the way the police in Los 
Angeles, and perhaps elsewhere, routinely act. But the Rodney King 
story is complicated. Extensive investigations revealed that there was 
a genuine, spastic concern that King might be armed, might have 
intended his own impetuous defense using a weapon. But in the Fuhrman 
telling of the treatment of four suspects there would seem to be 
nothing of that. It was clinical sadism. <p>
Already a quiet investigation by the Los Angeles Police has begun, 
designed, no doubt, to track the record of men handled over the years 
by Detective Fuhrman. Why did they not complain of their treatment by 
him? And if there was a record of Fuhrman engaged in such activity, 
why was he retained in the force? How will he be handled by the law? 
As a perjurer? He swore under oath that he had not used the term 
"nigger" when manifestly he had done so, using the word not in the 
detached tones of a storyteller, but with invidious gusto. "You're 
talking sh--. You sound like a nigger."<p>
It is endlessly fascinating. Fuhrman the cool bigot. O. J., who earned 
the confidence of his private investigator because of the coolness of 
his behavior in Chicago in the hours immediately after the killing. 
How could somebody so casual in his conduct during those hours before 
being told of his ex-wife's murder be guilty? But of course such 
reasoning, from the particular to the general, would justify 
confidence that the Fuhrman observed on the witness stand could not be 
the same Fuhrman who spoke into those tapes. <p>
The jury's responsibility in this case is awesome, extending far 
beyond the question of O. J.'s guilt or innocence. It touches on the 
recognition of the awful baseness of which human beings -- Americans -
- are capable. <p>

<h2>China Is Huffing And Puffing</h2><p>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"> <i><b>William F. Buckley Jr.
</center></b></i></a>
<hr><br>
We must suppose that the generals crowd around the power center in 
Peking with enticing war scenarios, as they dream of a military 
adventure against Taiwan. The Red Chinese, as one used to call them, 
have not fought a war since they took on Vietnam, a venture that ended 
in stalemate. That was twenty-odd years ago, and twenty-odd years 
before that, the Chinese army marched against the United States and 
South Korea, winning an ambiguous victory. That's a long time between 
wars, and the hunger for military action is sharp in the hearts of the 
Old Guard. They are men who stood by Mao Tse-tung during a period when 
he did more than any other man to damage China. And now the military 
sees the abandonment of Maoist ideals and, still more humiliating, an 
exactly corresponding rise in economic productivity. For that reason, 
among others, they clamor for the annexation of Taiwan.<p>

The pressure is exerted through the central figure in China, Deng 
Xiaoping, but biological decomposition is far along, and Deng must 
lean heavily on Li Peng and others. And the whole team would appear to 
speak with one voice on the matter of Taiwan. It isn't that they plan 
tomorrow to invade, but they desire that the diplomatic community 
should acknowledge, so to speak, that that is their right; they are 
dealing, after all, with a rogue province.<p>

The temperature heated almost to explosive levels when the President 
of Taiwan, Mr. Lee Teng-hui, went to Ithaca for a Cornell reunion. The 
eyes of the world were on the event because only one year earlier, 
President Lee had been denied the right to stop over in Hawaii to 
refuel his airplane. The outcry was so sharp on the Western side that 
President Clinton lifted the ban in order to permit the Cornell visit.<p>

How to handle China is a difficult question, but one shouldn't begin 
by picking a fight with Japan. Mr. Clinton pressed China in the cause 
of human rights while accomplishing nothing to further human rights, 
punctuating his Asia policy with threats to forbid the sale of 
Japanese Lexises. Peking withdrew its ambassador from Washington and 
imprisoned Harry Wu. The ambassador is coming back and Harry Wu has 
been released, but the pressure to bring this about had little to do 
with inventive U.S. diplomacy. It had to do with the congress of women 
in Peking, which China did not want to lose. After that, they covet 
the Olympics for 2004.<p>

But Taiwan does not sleep over it all. For one thing, Mr. Lee is going 
to run for a second term as president in March 1996. This will be the 
first election in which all Taiwanese participate. A free election in 
China is itself a unique event, but the Taiwanese venture especially 
galls Peking, on the quite logical grounds that Taiwan is acting like 
an independent country. Which indeed it is doing, which indeed it is. 
The historical haze that sits over the Taiwan Straits, as if Taiwan in 
an accidental moment of recent geological history had become detached 
from the mainland to float 170 miles out to sea, has become a miasma. 
Although there is fear among many Taiwanese of a mainland invasion, 
early indications are that Mr. Lee will be re-elected. He hasn't come 
out for the independence of Taiwan, but he has in recent months 
stressed that Taiwan is not receiving the kind of attention owing to 
an entity which has the most favorable balance of trade in the world 
and ranks tenth in economic power.<p>

And then Taiwan is not a military pushover. It has weapons, including 
American F-5s. Almost as a matter of definition, an island of 21 
million people would fall, in any prolonged engagement, to an army 
recruited from one billion people. But as one Taiwanese recently 
remarked in private conversation, if it looked as if military conquest 
were actually being scheduled, Taiwan could pull the diplomatic card 
from its sleeve: Declare itself an independent country, conduct a 
plebiscite that would confirm this status, and then ask for 
recognition. This would not diminish the mainland's proprietary 
rhetoric, but all the axes of diplomacy would necessarily rotate in 
the direction of recognizing an independent state.<p>

Always there is the possibility of a new regime in Peking after the 
death of Deng. But the prospect of one that is latitudinarian on the 
Taiwan question is beyond today's horizon.<p>

<title>Se Habla Ingles</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg"><center>
<i>NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 5</i><hr>

<h2>Se Habla Ingles</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><i><b>William F. Buckley Jr.</b></i></a><hr></center><br>
 

It was wise of Senator Dole to come down on English as the national 
language when he was firing away over the weekend at anti-U.S. 
academics. The movement to make English the official language of the 
United States is making legislative headway. The State of New 
Hampshire has just now enacted an English-language bill, and what 
appeals to New Hampshire, beyond apples, tends to appeal to 
presidential candidates.<p>

The principal lobbying group in favor of universalizing English (it is 
called "U.S. English") is ironically headed up by someone whose native 
language wasn't English (he is Mauro E. Mujica). And of course the 
heftiest warrior for English was the late senator and semanticist S. 
I. Hayakawa, whose native language was Japanese. Senator Hayakawa 
wanted nothing less than a constitutional amendment. U.S. English will 
settle for less; others want more.<p>

There is of course the other side. Why does the United States have to 
have a common language? After all, Switzerland doesn't.<p>

The first thing to learn about Switzerland is never to invoke what 
happens there in an effort to prove any point about any other country. 
Switzerland breaks all the rules, gets away with it; is a wonderful 
country with, unhappily, a bad drug problem.<p>

There are very good historical reasons why the French should have been 
permitted to nourish their language in Canada and, more recently, to 
insist on the recognition of French as a substitute language in 
everything from ballot forms to road signs. But every now and again 
Canada threatens to become two nations, and so reminds us of the 
burden the British would have been spared if, two hundred years ago, 
they had, after defeating the French, exported them back to France, or 
else sent them south to the United States, where immigrants were 
taught English.<p>

Opponents of the universalization of English use two arguments. The 
first is multiculturalist in ideology, the second, a faux 
cosmopolitanism. There is every reason in the world for the schools in 
the United States to teach foreign languages, beginning with Spanish, 
which is progressively important in commerce and hemispheric comity. 
But hanging onto one's Spanish if that is the native language is 
entirely different from depending on it.<p>

It makes sense in addressing the issue to close our eyes to what 
happens with the first generation. Yes, many immigrants -- perhaps 
millions -- who arrived here in middle age went on to become 
conversant with English. But millions did not, and will not, and it is 
an expression of geniality to give them radio and television and 
newspapers in Spanish.<p>

But their children need to be treated differently. I have experienced 
a 15-year-old boy who speaks English with difficulty even though he 
has lived in New York City with his mother for five years. It turns 
out that in public school, before he moved to a parochial school where 
he now studies, young Saul was taught six classes every day, five of 
them in Spanish.<p>

The quarrel is between two camps, one of them, so to speak, total 
immersion in its approach, the second a little looser. There are those 
who believe that English can only be rapidly mastered if every 
foreigner is required to use it when engaged in any transaction over 
which that person is superintended. Thus, for instance, employees at 
McDonald's would be required to talk to each other in English while 
on-premise. One way to generalize this approach is that everywhere 
you're not permitted to smoke, you are permitted to speak only in 
English.<p>

The approach of U.S. English is less draconian, so also is the House 
bill introduced by Representative Bill Emerson. It would enforce the 
use only of English in all government communications, forms, ballots, 
whatever. Mr. Emerson's bill has 180 sponsors, and in a previous 
version had also as sponsor Newt Gingrich, who endorses 
enthusiastically the notion of a national language, nationally 
accepted as such.<p>

It is really quite cruel to go in the other direction. A few years ago 
a middle-aged woman told me that when her parents were sent to Moscow 
they plunked her down in a Russian school. "I cried every day for 
about a month and in about six weeks I understood everything that was 
said in Russian." To stand in the way of young people devoting 
themselves to the English language is on the order of encouraging 
obesity by cramming them with Mars bars. It is surely the case that 
every immigrant who can now handle English is grateful for the 
experience even if it meant crawling through gnarled, spiky, thorny 
brushwood for a few months or years.<p>

<title>The Passions of the Greenpeacers</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<i>NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 8</i>
<hr>
<h2>The Passions Of the Greenpeacers</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
Commentator/philosopher Herbert Agar had a term for it -- "the 
anarchic passion to smash." He was writing fifty years ago about 
whatever it is that causes some people, especially when young, to give 
vent to the impulse to wreck -- if necessary, the nearest thing in 
sight. The politicization of that impulse had a lot of help during 
this century from ideology, which seemed to give it some purpose. The 
young Bolsheviks destroying everything they could lay their hands on 
in St. Petersburg. The young fascists on a spree in Milan. The Nazis, 
who could objectify that passion to smash in search of anything 
Jewish.<p>

We have it now, that anarchic passion, and the animating instrument is 
nuclear -- well, nuclear anything. Most recently the decision by the 
French to conduct some nuclear tests in the South Pacific. But 
anything that has the word "nuclear" attached to it helps to bring on 
that same spirit. Not long ago Jane Fonda was enthralling the younger 
generation by her movie The China Syndrome, the hero of which was a 
nuclear meltdown that threatened, oh, the end of the world, or 
something very close to that. The Greenpeace movement is based on an 
undifferentiated hostility to everything nuclear, and it is having a 
wonderful time these days in Tahiti.<p>

The French are a highly utilitarian people, in ways commendable and 
not so commendable. They acknowledge force majeure, as when Hitler 
quickly and decisively proved that his army was better than their 
army: so they quickly surrendered, and got along with the occupiers 
without too much of a fuss, leaving it to the exiled Charles de Gaulle 
to help to mobilize Great Britain and the United States to effect 
French liberation.<p>

When nuclear power was shown to be a reasonable means of providing 
energy, the French, without much fuss, simply went nuclear, so much so 
that nearly 80 per cent of French electricity is nowadays generated by 
nuclear plants. In the Sixties, President de Gaulle decided that it 
was not prudent to depend on American nuclear missiles to serve as a 
dispositive deterrent to Soviet expansionism, so he developed what he 
called a force de frappe, something small enough to be manageable but 
deadly enough to discourage overt Soviet military aggression. 
President Chirac, thirty years later, was persuaded that one more set 
of tests was necessary to ascertain that French nuclear resources were 
authoritative. Evidently only that one series is deemed necessary to 
achieve the desired level of efficiency -- and safety -- because M. 
Chirac has declared that after the conclusion of these tests, in May, 
he will commit France never again to test nuclear weapons.<p>

Philip Shenon of the New York Times reports on the honeymoon of a 
Seattle dermatologist, Sonja Krejci, and her new husband, Dr. Bill 
Clark, bound for a romantic Polynesian resort island after a scheduled 
connection at Papeete. But when they landed, far from making their 
connecting flight, they were imprisoned in the airport building 
surrounded by rioters, tear gas, and smoke. At one point the rioters 
assaulted everyone with rocks and stones, causing Dr. Clark, who is an 
orthopedic surgeon, to consider the possibility of needing to use his 
professional resources to keep his bride alive. "At one point," 
reports Mr. Shenon, "some of the rioters found a bulldozer, 'and they 
just drove it right into the terminal building -- smashing cars and 
destroying the restaurant,"' as the poor doctor put it. An estimate of 
the damage done to the airport comes to $11 million. No estimate is 
yet in on how many honeymoons originally scheduled for Tahiti have 
been rescheduled elsewhere.<p>

A reader of the ongoing press reports on the activities of Greenpeace 
and others stops suddenly -- or might do so -- to ask: What is it the 
protestors fear? Are the French experiments, conducted 750 miles from 
Tahiti, endangering anybody in Tahiti? For that matter, are they 
endangering anybody or anything in Mururoa, the atoll used for the 
nuclear testing? Has anybody detected a rise in pollutants in the area 
where the first tests were undertaken? Has a whale been killed? Two 
whales? Has $11 million in damage been done to the sea surrounding 
Mururoa?<p>

The answer has to be No, for the simple reason that if it were Yes, we 
absolutely would have heard about it. The Greenpeace types desperately 
need a martyr. A poisoned ocean, a scarred sun -- something that 
points to Chernobyl. But there isn't anything there. Only the anarchic 
passion to smash. <p>

<title>Say Hello To Senator Lugar</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<i>NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 15</i>
<hr>
<h2>Say Hello To Senator Lugar</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
Richard Lugar was in town, and when that happens these days to the 
restrained, brainy senior senator from Indiana it means he is engaged 
in promoting his presidential candidacy. You shut your eyes, think for 
a minute: Who is Richard Lugar? The snippets form up deep in the 
memory. Yes . . . Rhodes scholar . . . mayor of Indianapolis . . . 
U.S. senator . . . strangely overlooked by George Bush when he went to 
the other senator from Indiana, Mr. Quayle, as Vice President, given 
that Lugar had been around longer and has here and there been 
prominent in foreign-affairs analysis.<p>

"I know more about foreign policy than anyone running for President or 
serving as President," he says, "and that is a modest claim." He is 
not the wisecracking kind, but it is an effective line and, one 
supposes, will be used by him in Iowa and New Hampshire, provided he 
can find an audience there that is interested in foreign policy.<p>

Well, what are his audiences interested in hearing about? The answer 
is: mostly taxes. Senator Lugar has proposed the elimination of the 
Internal Revenue Service. The what? someone in the company asked. Yes 
. . . exactly that. And a 50 per cent reduction in the capital-gains 
tax. And a $500 tax credit, not exemption, for every child.<p>

Well, but how are we going to finance all that?<p>

A consumption tax. Richard Lugar is all for growth, but he doesn't 
count on it to guarantee the long-term growth of the American economy. 
What we do need to do is to disencumber the economy, which is groggy 
from taxation and regulation. But the future of the economy is the 
world market. Hundreds of millions of people who want, and will 
increasingly be able to pay for, American products.<p>

But doesn't that run into the burgeoning protectionist bloc? Yes, 
indeed it does, and Pat Buchanan is doing a very good job in stirring 
that up. "I had an exchange with Pat recently and I told him the 
United States was running a trade surplus with Europe." He was flatly 
unaware of this, and showed it.<p>

"Senator Gramm said recently," a guest said, "that as a sometime 
economics professor he is well equipped to challenge the high-tariff 
people, but that this can't be done in a two-minute give-and-take or 
over talk radio. Are you going to talk about 'comparative advantage' 
in a stump debate?"<p>

Well, said the senator, the answer to that question is: You have to do 
it. "Do you know something? It costs one thousand dollars less to 
assemble an automobile in Indiana than it does in Mexico. One thousand 
dollars, because our workers have the training, the capital plants, 
the education, the advantages of transportation. Windshield wipers for 
cars, manufactured in Canada, are moving to the U.S. -- because it's 
cheaper. But Pat has them cheering and hollering with arguments from 
another age."<p>

Is it true, as recently heard, that if GATT and NAFTA were up for 
ratification tomorrow in the Senate they wouldn't get through? Yes, 
the senator said, that is true, and true also that some of the young 
Republican congressmen are infected with the protectionist virus.<p>

The candidate went on to talk about the problems of the front-runner. 
A few months ago, he said, Mr. Dole was running ahead of Mr. Clinton 
in California. Now he is behind. It is entirely possible that in May 
the GOP will wake up to find that no one candidate has got a majority 
of the delegates. So what has been planned between May and August? The 
answer to that is: Nothing. Nothing has been planned between May and 
August. But during that time I could knit together my positions -- for 
lower taxes, and increased trade -- and take on Clinton after my 
nomination. "But you have to learn to put your message, like on 
tariffs, down in black and white, in large type."<p>

Well, one guest asked, why haven't you done that? Gotten a couple of 
ad people together and given them that assignment? The senator is not 
fast on the polemical draw. He might have said that there is no 
equivalent of E=mc2 for the tariff argument, but he let it go. "That's 
a good idea."<p>

Is Senator Lugar getting anywhere? The objective indices aren't 
pulling for him. His finances are strained, and he barely showed up in 
the Iowa skirmish two weeks ago. He leaves you with the comfortable 
feeling of having been in the company of a decent, well-educated man 
who was a groundbreaking mayor, and is a fine senator.<p>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois has introduced a measure under the title, 
Defend America Act of 1995. He is joined by Rep. Martin Hoke of Ohio 
in coming up with an idea strange to the imagination, namely that the 
defense of America depends to some extent on the freedom to act, and 
that that freedom to act was substantively forfeited in 1972 in the 
ABM Treaty.<p>

We are talking about that legendary bone of contention that allegedly 
forbids certain kinds of experiments in anti-missile technology, and 
flatly forbids deployment in more than one site. For a long time, a 
technical argument engaged legislators and diplomats as to whether 
experiments focused on the "brilliant pebble" were precluded under the 
terms of the 1972 agreement. The idea has been to arm satellites with 
slingshots, in effect, to destroy atmosphere-bound missiles. But the 
interesting question became, in the first phase, Why don't we pull 
away from the 1972 treaty? When Caspar Weinberger was secretary of 
defense under President Reagan he argued the legitimacy of 
experimentation, but Congress was not convinced, and appeasers all 
over the world argued against pulling back from any treaty the Soviet 
Union had agreed to.<p>

Mr. Reagan, though the proud author of the original insight into anti-
missile missiles (the Strategic Defense Initiative), never got around 
to serving the six-month notice required by the treaty to announce its 
rescission. Out of office, Mr. Weinberger publicly argued in favor of 
rescission, but his voice and other voices were drowned out by 
appeasers and others afraid of any initiative the Soviet Union would 
frown on.<p>

But of course now, although we have a treaty, there is a question 
whether the entity with which we entered into that arrangement still 
exists. The government of "Russia" is not the legitimate heir to the 
government of the Soviet Union, any more than the government of Lenin 
was the heir to the government of Nicholas II. Still . . . (it is 
argued) it does no particular harm to proceed as though the treaty 
were alive. The thing to do is to rescind it.<p>

Now this can hardly be interpreted as a provocative act given that the 
doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction is no longer operative, since 
Russia and America are no longer at war against each other. But the 
Senate of the United States, on September 6, reached a "bipartisan 
compromise" on the matter of missile defense. The senators who 
produced that compromise claimed to have been guided by their concern 
for missile defense. But what they proceeded to do was to authorize 
future deployment only on behalf of America's allies, and American 
forces abroad. The important question, which has to do with research 
and deployment for continental defense, is therefore skirted, leaving 
us, in the phrase of defense strategist Frank Gaffney, in a state of 
"abject vulnerability" to nuclear attack by missiles of a rogue state.<p>

The senators who framed the great evasion of September 6 acknowledge 
all the correct things. "The threat that is posed to the national 
security of the United States by the proliferation of ballistic and 
cruise missiles is significant and growing, both quantitatively and 
qualitatively. . . . There is a danger that determined countries will 
acquire intercontinental ballistic missiles in the near future and 
with little warning by means other than indigenous development." The 
senators' research even acknowledges that "the concept of mutual 
assured destruction, which was one of the major philosophical 
rationales for the ABM Treaty, is now questionable as the basis for 
stability in a multipolar world." So? So -- do nothing. That is, 
nothing that contributes to continental defense.<p>

Congressman Hyde, with his keen eye for the quick of a question, 
acknowledges that the shadow of the 1972 treaty has the effect of 
dimming strategic and tactical visibility, and should be disposed of 
once and for all. Accordingly, the Hyde -  Hoke measure would direct 
the President to notify the Russian Federation that the United States 
intends to exercise its right under the treaty's Article XV to 
withdraw from the accord.<p>

One has to hope that an enlightened debate will ensue. There aren't 
really many questions that need answering. 1) Does rescission of the 
treaty in any conceivable way endanger Russia? (No.) 2) Can research 
and deployment help us to shore up our defenses? (Yes.) 3) Are there 
other nations that might benefit from a vigorous anti-missile program? 
(Yes. All nations that wish protection from missiles.)<p>

<title>Steve Forbes, Front and Right</title>

<i>NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 22</i>
<hr>
<h2>Steve Forbes, Front and Right</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
The entry into the presidential race of Malcolm (Steve) Forbes Jr. is 
something more than merely ho-ho time. Commentator William Schneider, 
on CNN, snappily summed it up: If Dole stumbles, it becomes an open 
race, and Forbes has the money to project his views.<p>

They are as rumored. The single unusual feature of his free-market 
program is a call for a return to the gold standard, something we have 
not heard much about since Lewis Lehrman retired from politics. Money-
exchange issues don't have the sex they had back when William Jennings 
Bryan set out to save the American people from crucifixion on a cross 
of gold. What the word "gold" tends to communicate today is merely 
sound currency, anti-inflation. Mr. Forbes assured his following that 
when his Administration takes office, once again people will be able 
to think in terms of 4.5 per cent interest rates on their mortgages.<p>

Beware, said Forbes, the use of the comparative "-er." As in "cheaper" 
government, "lower" taxation. Forbes would do away entirely with the 
tax code. He calls for a $36,000 exemption from federal taxes, after 
which the tax would be a flat 17 per cent. Capital-gains taxes would 
be phased out. Prometheus, unbound.<p>

Steve Forbes will tell you in unharassed conversation that there is 
something missing in the other campaigners for the Republican 
nomination. In his announcement speech he paid the formal courtesies 
to the other candidates: every one of them would be an improvement on 
what we now have. "[Yet] I think a lot of people would agree, there is 
an empty feeling in this campaign so far. One reason is that none of 
the other candidates is raising high the banner of economic expansion 
and opportunity. . . . But there are other reasons for the empty 
feeling. The fact is, the other candidates, on both sides, are 
insiders. And we all know that if the insiders had the answers, they 
would have implemented them by now." The emphasis, says Forbes, is on 
his own entrepreneurial background. This uniquely qualifies him, in 
his understanding, to lead the charge to high-octane economic energy.
<p>
But when he has the quiet opportunity to do so, he focuses, of course, 
on Phil Gramm, the only competitor in sight, in the event Dole should 
founder. "He is as smart a man as I have ever known," Steve Forbes 
will tell you. But -- he thinks -- Gramm's candidacy overstresses the 
negative, the need to cut spending in particular. Forbes is the 
enthusiast who sees an American giant bursting with innovative energy, 
shackled by the Lilliputians of Washington with their tax codes, 
regulations, bureaucracy -- the culture of Washington, which, he says, 
as a true outsider he is uniquely liberated from. Steve Forbes truly 
believes that the special music in the political air of 1996 is not 
elsewhere being heard, and that he can serve as the tunesmith for the 
nation.<p>

The announcement speech he made was hardly musical (". . . like John 
F. Kennedy did," "like Ronald Reagan did . . ." -- Steve Forbes and 
Adlai Stevenson attended the same college!). But it was very very 
American. He has come into the political fight with the brashness of 
the wholesome iconoclast. There is nothing there of the grouch, no 
petulance, no swagger: Steve Forbes is not Ross Perot. And even though 
the odds are preposterously adverse, he is willing to make the run and 
to finance his own campaign.<p>

What can sympathetic but skeptical conservatives say about it all? 
"Look," Forbes said recently to a friend. "I am a male, I am white, a 
Protestant, an Ivy Leaguer, rich, business-oriented, without practical 
political experience. It couldn't be worse, but at least I'd like to 
be free to fall down on my own arse, without any help from 
conservatives." Fair enough, and bon voyage. <p>

<h2>Grave Business In Los Angeles</h2><br>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>


 

The cliche has it that anything Johnnie Cochran et al. can do to 
spring their client is okay. If this is so, they have certainly abided 
by that liberty. At the end of Thursday, Mr. Cochran had done his best 
to convince the jurors that either O. J. Simpson is guiltless and 
should be set free, and perhaps lionized in an effort to expiate the 
troubles he has seen, or else the jurors don't believe in the Bible, 
in the Constitution, or that Hitler went too far.
                                              <P>
Now pay close attention to what is going on. The cameras take us to an 
impromptu press conference called by Fred Goldman, who is the father 
of Ron, the young man killed alongside Nicole. Mr. Goldman is teeming 
with resentment and fires both barrels. "He's talking about racism and 
he's talking about hate? Who does he connect himself with? This man 
ought to be ashamed of himself to talk among decent human beings. He 
is one of the most disgusting human beings I have ever had to listen 
to in my life. Because of racism, we should put aside all other 
thoughts, all other reason, and set his murdering client free?"
                                    <P>
Well, that statement brought counterfire from the other side. The 
elder sister of O.J. took the floor for the first time to plead the 
innocence and virtue of her brother. But she said something more 
important, really, than that she was standing by for sibling loyalty. 
She said that "only" the jurors could pronounce the truth on all these 
questions being raised. The truth, of course, on whether O.J. killed 
Nicole and Goldman. But, derivatively, the case Mr. Cochran was 
pleading: that Mark Fuhrman, the racist detective, was 
indistinguishable from Adolf Hitler, that the Los Angeles police are 
happy to send an innocent man to jail for life, even though they know 
him not to be guilty. The point here is that, once again, we are asked 
to see the jury as an instrument for uncovering the Truth. To believe 
this is to surrender to the powers of hypnotists.
                         <P>
That of course is what Johnnie Cochran and Barry Scheck have attempted 
to do, to hypnotize the jury, and the inducements have been about as 
comprehensive as they can be. If you believe that Hitler was evil, 
then you have to fight Hitlerism in America, which is embodied in Mark 
Fuhrman, who uncovered the glove with O.J.'s blood on it, which glove 
had been placed there by Hitler. If you believe that the Los Angeles 
Police Department did some sloppy work, then you must believe that its 
motive in doing so was to advance the fraudulent case against O.J. If 
you believe, with Luke, that little lies often indicate bigger lies, 
then you must vindicate O.J. You cannot, simultaneously, believe in 
O.J.'s guilt, and in St. Luke's divine inspiration.
                <P>
It does remind one -- does it not? -- of some of the great show trials 
of the Thirties, conducted by Stalin. When it was charged that 
Bukharin was guilty of counterrevolutionary activity, not only the 
Soviet court nodded its acquiescent head, but a lot of other people 
did too, including American intellectuals. It required the labors of 
the Dewey Commission and some hard analysis by a generation of 
scholars to set the record absolutely right. In Moscow the court was 
the creature of Josef Stalin and would have ruled, if told to do so, 
that the earth is flat. The question seriously arises whether the 
court, in Los Angeles, becomes the creature of Johnnie Cochran, whose 
use of apocalyptic rhetoric transforms the question, Did he do it, or 
did he not do it? into the question, Do you believe in God, do you not 
believe in God? Into, Do you believe in civil liberties, do you not 
believe in civil liberties? 
                                                                                <P>
If one had confidence in Judge Ito one might hope that he could move 
the jury back to reality, to relieve the jury of any notion that it is 
complicit in Nazism if it finds O.J. guilty. How would the Soviet 
court have reacted if it had been given, the day before its ruling, 
Arthur Koestler's Darkness at Noon to read? But Judge Ito is in over 
his head, and just possibly it is true that Western judicial procedure 
is in over its head. If a persuasive shaman is left free to seduce a 
bleary, near-dead-from-fatigue jury that theirs is to justify death, 
or to save Western idealism, then we are talking about something very 
different from the administration of justice.

<title>Buckley:  The Hangover</title>

<hr>

<h2>The Hangover</h2><br>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
The brainy wife of the brainy professor said, "I think the O.J. 
verdict should be protested." The brainy professor said, "How?"
                            <P>
Indeed. How?
                    <P>
The prattle, in which such as Senator Dole are engaged, is that we 
must accept the verdict and turn over a new leaf. Well, it is one 
thing to accept the verdict as a juridical reality: Nobody is arguing 
that O. J. Simpson should be sent back to jail. It is quite another 
thing to abide by the superstition that justice has been done. A lot 
of white folks who lynched black folks in the bad days went scot free 
because white jurors wouldn't convict them. But there are those who 
left that age with their honor intact: they screamed and yelled, and 
insisted that justice was not done. Screaming and yelling doesn't come 
naturally to a lot of people, but the brainy wife of the brainy 
professor was right, the verdict should be protested. 
          <P>
One way to do this is to remark the little filigrees on formal 
acquittal, and resist their effrontery. Johnnie Cochran tells the 
press moments after the verdict that the will of God has been done, as 
he knew it would be. One sighs: someone who can compare Mark Fuhrman 
to Adolf Hitler can, one supposes, adduce the will of God as 
motivating the jury's finding. Let us in charity assume that the 
relatives of O.J. sincerely thought him to be innocent, and pass over 
their bulletins to the effect that justice had been done. But what are 
we to make of O.J.'s solemn declaration that, now that the distraction 
has been swept away, the police should get serious and search out the 
real killer. He, O.J., will do "whatever it takes" to identify him. 
One way to begin this search is for everyone to submit a blood sample 
to the laboratories. And then ask the one out of 28 million with the 
telltale blood -- that adds up to about thirty people, sprinkled about 
in Tibet, Tierra del Fuego, and Kazakhstan -- what they were doing on 
the night of June 12, 1994.
<P>
And yes, we really should equip ourselves against hit-and-run self-
vindication by legerdemain. Johnnie Cochran was on Larry King Live on 
Wednesday saying what you would expect, the phone rings, and lo! O.J. 
is on the line. He says serene things, and then chastises a woman who 
had called in to ask Mr. Cochran to explain the shadowy creature who 
had been identified by the limo driver as coming into the Rockingham 
driveway just before 11 the night of the murders. O.J. says, Did the 
woman not listen to the witness, because the witness, if you followed 
him carefully, had said something quite different, and oh! how much 
he, O.J., had suffered from people drawing conclusions from the 
testimony which the testifiers had simply not said, understand?
                                     <P>
It is on the order of rising to say, "I told you there wasn't a purple 
cow on the property that night, DID I NOT?" People begin nodding their 
heads. We are off to the races with the reconstruction of the scene 
that night in June, one little piece at a time. 
                         <P>
What effect will the verdict have on the career of Colin Powell, 
somebody asked? Answer: One would hope none. But there is most 
definitely a danger there. When 75 percent of black Americans believe 
that the answer is A, not B, and 75 percent of white Americans 
believe that the answer is B, not A, then what we have is a breakdown 
in communication between two cultures. Either we share a common 
language and a common rational apparatus or we do not. It is a very 
very scary thing when three-quarters of one ethnic group flatly 
disagree with three-quarters of another ethnic group about the 
structure of rational arguments. It is simply wrong to suppose that 
the white majority believed O.J. to be guilty because he was black. It 
is simply undeniable that the black majority believed him innocent 
because he was black. And -- remarkably -- those figures remained 
static throughout those endless months of testimony. It was tempting 
for the white majority to conclude that the black majority was engaged 
in iconolatry. O.J. is a hero and that is the end of it. 
                <P>
Not entirely hard to understand. If the spelunkers were to come up 
from their caves with evidence that St. Francis of Assisi ate live 
pigeons for breakfast, there are those of us who would simply refuse 
to believe it. Legends, to be legendary, must be sacred, inviolate. 
But this is not to dodge the question: Yes. If the innocence of O.J. 
is a black postulate, then intercommunication has suffered a quite 
awful setback.

<title>Buckley:  Understanding the Papal Bull</title>

<i>NEW YORK, OCTOBER 10</i>

<hr>

<h2>Understanding the Papal Bull</h2><br>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>



The impression made by Pope John Paul was quite simply stunning. 
Granted, the panoply was intoxicatingly splendid; yet all those 
millions of candles and choirboys and bishops would not have given the 
spectator such life as he got from what he saw and heard if its 
centerpiece had been a nice old bore. The transfiguring feature of all 
those appearances was the man, and his words. "May the Holy Spirit 
strengthen your hearts, making them blameless and holy before our God 
and Father, so that you may serve His people with ever greater joy." 
We are not talking about sound bites.
                                                            <P>
But one needs to be reminded that the exhortations of a pope are 
customarily done in the paradigmatic mode, which is fitting for the 
primary spokesman for Biblical injunctions. The language of Moses and 
of Christ is totalist in its formulation. We are enjoined to be -- 
saintly.
                                            <P>
This is beyond the reach of all but the very few. Even so, what we 
hear said about how we should be cannot be attenuated by the 
foreknowledge of man's inability to attain perfection. Give everything 
you have to the poor and join the pilgrimage of Christ -- here is a 
rock-solid injunction, toward the discharge of which human efforts are 
almost necessarily asymptotic. States are the organs of individuals, 
and so one runs into difficulties translating Christian imperatives 
into social policy. This is a problem that every pope in this century 
has faced, and Pope John Paul II cannot solve it, perhaps because it 
cannot be solved.
                            <P>
It has frequently been noticed that papal declarations tend to be 
undernourished on the matter of production. The emphasis is almost 
always on distribution. Thus we hear from papal declarations dating 
back more than one century about the obligation of the rich to give to 
the poor. The question naturally arises: It is right for Wealthy John 
to give to Poor Peter, but do we translate this into an obligation by 
John to vote to instruct Internal Revenue to descend on Wealthy James, 
to give to Poor Peter? The incorporation of individual virtue into 
state policy is a difficult business.
                 <P>
Consider the question of immigration. The Pope said, shortly after 
landing, "America keeps compassion, generosity and concern for others 
at the very heart of its efforts. . . . From the beginning until now, 
the United States has been a haven for generation after generation of 
new arrivals. Men, women, and children have streamed here from every 
corner of the globe, building new lives and forming a society of rich 
ethnic and racial diversity based on commitment to a shared vision of 
human dignity and freedom."
  <P>
Now this is not accurate historical accounting. What it is is a 
sublimation of American history. It is American history as it would be 
recounted if Americans were all saints -- and if no grass ever grew to 
interrupt the waterflow of goodness.
                                                                              <P>
What is true is that American compassion has been marked and still is: 
50 per cent of the world's immigration to the developed countries is 
into the United States. But it is also true that several times in 
American history Congress has elected to limit, or even to suspend, 
immigration. Sometimes the motivations of individual congressmen are 
xenophobic -- they just don't want any more foreigners. The Oriental 
Exclusion Act was quite straightforward on this matter.
                                                               <P>
But sometimes, also, practical considerations were at the forefront of 
legislative action. During the Depression it would hardly have made 
sense to invite a large wave of immigrants into a country in which 
millions were suffering and 20 per cent were unemployed. And then the 
question arises today: Is it a trespass on Christian principles to 
advocate a temporary restriction in the current rate of immigration? 
Is Barbara Jordan -- who headed the commission that recommended 
exactly that -- anti-Christian?
                                               <P>
Manifestly, it isn't so. Yet to advocate reduced immigration isn't to 
fault the Pope for speaking in the language of prophets, who deal not, 
and should not deal, with such questions as: Is California going broke 
under the burden? Is multiculturalism breaking up our culture? Why are 
there national borders, if immigration is not properly a matter of 
government policy?
                                   <P>
What we are left with is the papal injunction to: compassion, 
generosity, and concern for others. The particularization of those 
sentiments is necessarily a problem for individual states.

<html><head><title>Buckley:  Should There Be a Law?</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg"><center><i>NEW YORK, OCTOBER 13</i><hr><h2>Should There Be a Law?</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 

This is an exploratory column, its purpose to encourage thought on a 
question that badly needs thinking about. 
<p>
The Problem: The birth every year of one million babies to unwed 
mothers. 
<p>
The Consequence: One million children who, on reaching the age of 13, 
tend to run into difficulties. The statistics tell us that the child 
raised by a single parent is likelier by a factor of 600 per cent to 
commit crimes, consume drugs, quit school, and bear, or sire, children 
out of wedlock. Assume -- if only to be hopeful -- that the problems 
diminish after age 19, we are still left with six million teenagers 
who are a heavy social burden, as also, of course, a burden to 
themselves. 
<p>
A Social Deterrent? Since manifestly it is against the interest of 
society, for reasons moral and material, to encourage the birth of 
babies to unwed mothers, what might be done to discourage the 
practice? Only one serious suggestion has been made, and at book 
length, by Mr. Charles Murray. He believes that welfare payments to 
unwed mothers serve as inducements and therefore that to eliminate 
that miscarriage of charity would significantly reduce illegitimacy 
(which is up, in the last thirty years, from 5 per cent to 18 per cent 
among whites, from 25 per cent to 63 per cent among blacks). We have 
seen that Congress has played around with this question, and that the 
proposal is well on its way to limit payments to two illegitimate 
births. This approach hardly addresses the problem with appropriate 
sternness. Among other things, we all know that if the third child 
were sick or starving, we'd look after it. The effort should focus on 
preventing the procreative act, rather than on mistreating the child.
<p>
A Civil Delinquency? As things now stand, the father (or mother) of a 
child born out of wedlock runs into no civil resistance of any sort. 
As far as the law is concerned, it is safer to have a bastard child 
than to double-park. A couple of years ago Bill Moyers did a 
documentary on the culture of wanton sex and found himself speaking to 
a young black stud, about twenty years old if memory serves, who 
proudly acknowledged fatherhood of three children by three different 
girls/ women, and gaily announced his intention of pursuing his 
bluebirdism, since he found it amusing. All that Mr. Moyers was able 
to manage was a gentle sigh for the pieties of yesteryear, which will 
get you exactly nothing from the people we are talking about. 
<p>
Are There Other Deterrents? Well yes, there are. To list some such is 
not necessarily to recommend them. But just as the Pentagon 
undoubtedly has a file on how to invade Switzerland, here is one on 
some of the deterrents that might be given a little thought.
<p>
 -- Deny a driving license to the parents for five years. (This side 
of imprisonment and death by hanging, this is the deepest known 
deprivation in the American culture.)
<p>
 -- Require the father to perform ten hours of appropriate work every 
week on whatever project makes sense. 
<p>
 -- Require the father to spend three evenings every week sequestered. 
Including Saturday night.
<p>
 -- Do a vasectomy on the man. A Norplant on the girl. 
<p>
Now these approaches raise problems, to put it lightly. There is, to 
begin with, the problem of locating the father. This accomplished, 
some proceeding or another would need to address the question whether, 
when the sexual union was done, the parties had agreed somewhere along 
the line to get married. In Sweden, about one-half the babies are 
conceived pre-marriage, but 90 per cent are born to two parents living 
together. How do you handle the situation: "Henry said he loved me and 
we'd be married just as soon as he finished high school"?
<p>
Is there a constitutional problem? Suppose that Henry says that 
without a driver's license he will be fired, because he earns his 
money delivering newspapers? Can the physical detention of the father 
be done without a judicial proceeding? Are there at hand convenient 
ways of absolutely identifying the father by DNA? Are vasectomies and 
Norplants acceptable, under such circumstances, in moral theology?
<p>
All these are designed as open questions, to flush out thought. 
Although commentary can't be acknowledged, I'd welcome having it, 
directed to me here at NATIONAL REVIEW, 150 East 35th Street, New 
York, N.Y. 10016.

<html><head><title>Buckley:  The UN at 50</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg"><center><i>NEW YORK, OCTOBER 24</i><hr><h2>The UN at 50</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
Fifty years of the United Nations certainly does not bring on 
undifferentiated congratulations. The world organization received a 
jump start on hypocrisy when, in San Francisco, on a motion that 
Sweden, Switzerland, and Ireland be admitted, the ruling was negative, 
on the grounds that they were not "peace-loving nations." They were 
three countries that had not gone to war. But the term "peace-loving" 
had already got into the hands of the wordsmiths who gave us the 
"Democratic Republic of Germany," which was Soviet-speak for 
undemocratic unrepublican East Germany. 
<p>
In the Security Council we had from the outset the Soviet Union as a 
permanent member with veto rights, and then China, with the same 
rights. And in the General Assembly, with spooky consistency the Third 
World powers voted against Western measures, in line with Soviet 
measures. When in 1960 Fidel Castro, freshly arrived in power, visited 
the UN, he was hailed as a hero. In 1979, after he had clearly 
established himself as a ruler as tyrannical as those who presided 
over North Korea and Albania, he visited the United Nations again; 
and, again, was treated as a hero by the majority of its members. 
<p>
On Sunday, President Clinton opened the celebratory proceedings by 
giving a moderate speech about this and that. Later in the day, Castro 
spoke -- the usual tirade against Western conventions, larded with the 
usual declamations in favor of self-government everywhere except in 
Cuba -- and got an ovation. Much heavier applause than that given to 
the President of the host country, our old friend, the superpower, 
Uncle Sam. 
<p>
We pause to note that one reason for the anti-U.S. fever within the UN 
these days is our failure to pay our debt to the UN. When the 
organization was founded, President Truman accepted an imposition on 
the U.S. of 40 per cent of the UN's budget. In the immediate postwar 
world that was not an unreasonable allocation, given that we were at 
the time generating about 50 per cent of the world's production. In 
1972 we reduced our share to 25 per cent, in line with the reviving 
economic fortunes of other countries. But in 1982 we began to stall on 
our payments, in part because we thought the allocations for peace-
keeping expenses were rigged against us, in part because the relevant 
committees in Congress found it tempting to economize at the expense 
of an organization not all that popular back home.
<p>
But the result of it is a very considerable embarrassment. If the 
State Department believes we are unfairly burdened, then that case 
should be made. But to make it by simply refusing to pay is to act the 
deadbeat. We are not alone in lateness in paying our share, but we are 
the major offender and certainly the most conspicuous. It would be 
nice to hear from the presidential candidates that they don't go for 
cheating on obligations, whether to the American Express Company or to 
the United Nations.
<p>
The pointed objective of Fidel Castro this time around is to generate 
pressure to repeal the U.S. embargo. It is nice to see the 
tatterdemalion prince of universal prosperity through Marxism begging 
U.S. business to come on down and give him a hand. And on the merits 
of the argument, there is every reason to restore relations with Cuba 
given that it is no longer a salient of a global power seeking the 
overthrow of the United States. We would need to swallow our pride, 
but then that is healthy: we did not succeed in bringing Castro down, 
and it is not dignified to salve our bad consciences by continuing 
policies appropriate only during the Cold War. We are trading with 
Vietnam and China, and we never really broke off from trading with the 
Soviet Union, so why Castro?
<p>
He made his demonstration at the UN, and sharply, and sadly, reminded 
us all that if the division within the UN were once again suddenly to 
return to Communist superpower challenging Western superpower, we'd 
almost certainly find ourselves face to face with the old lineup. 
About 80 per cent anti-American. The old juices run strong, anti-, and 
jealous of, success; there are memories mired in anti-colonialist 
slogans, and then, too, some defensible skepticism over U.S. 
leadership. 
<p>
But the UN is with us. We should pay our debt, ignore most of its 
pieties, and make policy as we have always made it, soliciting UN 
sanction but quite prepared, when necessary, to ignore it.

<html><head><title>Buckley:  New York Live</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg"><center><i>NEW YORK, OCTOBER 27</i><hr><h2>New York Live</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
New York City early in the week was just the place to sharpen up on 
political and social protocol, Messrs. Giuliani and Rangel acting as 
dancing masters. The headlines went to the mayor, who sent two 
bouncers to Lincoln Center to escort Yasir Arafat out of the theater. 
This was done, apparently, even though the Palestinian delegation had 
received three tickets for the concert organized by the mayor for his 
international diplomats. The ouster was hailed by Mr. Giuliani's most 
intimate associates, condemned by everyone else, the State Department 
apoplectic in the matter. Mr. Giuliani's point was that as a 
prosecutor years ago he had handled, or been given to study, instances 
of terrorism done by Arafat and his organization. He would not, he 
declared to the press, serve as gracious host to anyone who had 
engaged in terrorism. 
<p>
That position can empty the house, of course. The former prime 
minister of Israel, Menachem Begin, not only participated in terrorist 
activity, he headed up Irgun, a terrorist organization. Nelson 
Mandela, even in jail, headed up an organization that proudly and 
defiantly exercised and defended terrorism. But if Mayor Giuliani had 
led President Mandela from the floor, he'd have provoked the black 
community, and maybe even would have violated one of the civil-rights 
laws. President Jiang Zemin of China is not too old to have 
participated in the Cultural Revolution, sustained by acts of state 
terrorism designed to tranquilize inquisitive children. And of course 
we had Castro.
<p>
Castro is a continuing phenomenon. After his opening speech at the UN 
he donned his battle fatigues and went up to Harlem, where he was 
treated as O.J. would have been if he had killed two women, not just 
one. Representative Charlie Rangel gave and got a bear hug, a 
significant emotional advancement for a man who only a few years ago 
railed against any commerce, diplomatic or material, with South 
Africa. <p>

The curious were entitled to wonder exactly why. Why should Democratic 
die-hard Charles Rangel be enthusiastic about the accomplishments of 
Fidel Castro? To begin with, there are no accomplishments save for 
full employment for prison guards and executioners. The only 
significant accomplishment of Fidel Castro is to have kept himself 
alive, given that there are at least a million Cubans who would gladly 
pull the trap on any scaffold on which Fidel Castro was poised. And 
staying alive was a considerable achievement, given that the United 
States' Operation Mongoose made several attempts to assassinate him, 
including one that dispatched for his use a scuba-diving suit that 
after a few minutes would transform itself into a host of piranhas; 
and, on another occasion, a superb cigar, except that it was designed 
to explode after two or three draws. On this matter, Fidel had himself 
a good laugh, when he told his audience in Harlem that he was not 
participating in State Department ceremonies because he didn't want to 
"interfere in this country's foreign affairs." 
<p>
Castro was received at the Council on Foreign Relations, which is okay 
given that the CFR flat-out invites any state leader, no questions 
asked, to its chambers to discuss that leader's line. And then also 
Castro dined privately with twenty establishment figures. Among them 
was Robert McNamara, defense secretary at the time Castro was 
receiving nuclear missiles aimed at the United States. We must suppose 
that Secretary McNamara apologized for acting so peremptorily back in 
1962 when he demanded the withdrawal of the missiles. We like to think 
that Castro was big about it and forgave McNamara. 
<p>
He was after all in an expansive mood, boasting that there were more 
doctors per capita in Cuba than in the United States and offering to 
send to America a few doctors to look after Americans in need. We were 
reminded of Eva Peron, who in 1949 offered straightfacedly to send 
clothes for the underclad children in Washington. . . . <p>And all the 
while New Yorkers thought that the burlesque was on Broadway.

<html><head><title>Buckley:  Yitzhak Rabin, RIP</title>

<i>NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 7</i>

<hr>

<h2>Yitzhak Rabin, RIP</h2><br>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>

Viewing the TV and reading the papers in the days after the 
assassination one got some idea of how Mr. Rabin operated. One 
reporter said that to see Mr. Rabin was as easy as calling him up and 
taking the ten-minute trip from the reporter's office to the office of 
the prime minister. Another spoke of his "thirty or forty" sessions 
with him over the years.
<p>
And then there were the eulogies. A retired professor who served many 
years on the college admissions committee spoke once of the skill 
developed after a few years in detecting letters of recommendation 
that are synthetic. Just so, listeners to eulogies develop after a 
while an ability to discriminate between the formalistic and the 
genuine. Many eloquent statements were made, some of them -- from men 
and women who had worked closely with Rabin -- heartfelt beyond any 
histrionic power to deceive. The tribute paid by Henry Kissinger is 
not easily forgotten.
<p>
Three days ago I'd have thought it singular to recall that twice Mr. 
Rabin was with me on Firing Line and that he had once come with a 
friend to lunch with my wife and me in Switzerland. To say this now, 
which is to confess to only three encounters with him over the years, 
suggests I was practically an exile, all but ignored by the great man, 
so profuse were his journalistic and social energies.
<p>
The various passions stirred by his death are by now familiar. We know 
that a cruel element of the tragedy was the background of the 
assassin: of all things, an Orthodox Jew, rising to kill the greatest 
living Jewish hero. There is the consternation having to do with the 
political legacy. Yes, Shimon Peres will pursue the same ends. But 
although it is acknowledged that the death of Mr. Rabin will renew the 
momentum of the peace movement, its longevity cannot be taken for 
granted. When Lincoln died (Ambassador Eagleburger likened the two 
events) the nation was for a period buoyed by the sentiments he 
expressed in his second inaugural address, but it was not long before 
Reconstruction became the ugly thing it was.
<p>
In the case of Israel, something needs to be done to restore the 
perspective of those who fought Rabin. It is difficult to believe that 
people who deem themselves Israeli patriots would as recently as a few 
weeks ago design an effigy of Rabin wearing swastikas. In New York 
City one young follower of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane declared on 
television that violence can be "bad" but it can also be "good." He 
had whatever reserve of good sense it took to decline to say that he 
was pleased that Rabin had been a target of "good" violence, but he 
left that impression, cultivating as he was the line that the return 
by Israel of parts of the West Bank was high treason.
<p>
Policy differences, then, can hardly be expected to disappear in 
tribute to one martyr. Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu was convincing in his 
disavowal of the killer-division of the Israelis who join him in 
opposing the policies of Rabin and Peres. But there are Jews who are 
models of civil rectitude who oppose those policies, and they will not 
be silenced by the silencing of Mr. Rabin, nor should they: the 
security of Israel is properly the paramount concern of the Israeli 
government.
<p>
It's not all that easy to communicate to others the meaning of the 
birth of the State of Israel. Jeffrey Hart, writing several years ago, 
put it, "Now I can understand why Israel in fact has become sacred. 
The history of the twentieth century is, to put it mildly, unique. The 
Holocaust is a sort of hole in the cosmos, a guarantor of the 
existence of evil. It is an equivalent for Jews of the Crucifixion. 
Israel then became the equivalent of the Redemption. This is true even 
for relatively secular Jews. Judaism has never successfully separated 
God and Tribe. The People itself is the God carrier. I think that from 
a full experience of the twentieth century I am willing to accept the 
sacredness of Israel as a religious fact."
<p>
That is the reason the death of Yitzhak Rabin was a transfiguring 
event. That he died, and how he died, and when he died, and for what 
he died. <p>

<html><head><title>Buckley:  What Made Colin Run?</title>

</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>

<center>

<i>NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 10</i>

<hr>

<h2>What Made Colin Run?</h2><br>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>

The grave dignity of Colin Powell's announcement had the effect of 
causing dismayed observers to thrash out at those who had opposed his 
candidacy. This is a psychological phenomenon: Mom has an accident 
coming home from work and reproaches abound -- Why did Dad let her go 
on working so late in life? Why didn't Sonny, who after all is a car 
salesman, force Mom to get a better, stronger car? To say nothing of 
Mom's stupid eye doctor, who should have known Mom's glasses needed 
strengthening.
<p>
It happens even to wise and street-smart chappies, e.g., William 
Safire of the New York Times. He let himself go twice in his Powell 
column, once directly, once obliquely. He set up his target by 
carefully orienting his argument as testimony to General Powell's 
courage, a technique he knows as paralepsis, which is the affirmation 
of the point you wish to make by denying it ("I come to bury Caesar, 
not to praise him"); only Safire did it the other way around. 
"Certainly Powell was not chased off the field by the performance last 
week before the National Press Club of the Hard-Right Follies; the 
finger-wagging by that old abortion-and-school-prayer set was manna 
from Heaven for a moderate Republican's nomination campaign." Later in 
the same column, Mr. Safire made reference to "Arlen Specter, the pro-
choice candidate, with nobody on his side on that issue except the 
majority of Republican voters."
<p>
The Miami Herald weighed in weightily. "True conservatives want frugal 
government, but also prudent investments in children, concern for the 
needy, and a desire to widen economic opportunity, not just pile 
benefits onto the wealthy. General Powell says that 'the party of 
Lincoln' (a phrase borrowed from Kemp) [my impression was that the 
phrase was first used by Andrew Johnson] can balance these interests 
best, and that's why he chose to be a Republican. But he recognizes 
that he will have to fight -- hard -- to restore those values to a 
party lately hijacked by the Christian Coalition and its acolytes." 
And then Maureen Dowd, also of the New York Times, contributed the 
news that General Powell "had exposed the Christian Right as a 
panicked sectarian phenomenon."
<p>
What are we to make of all this? The Christian Right is indeed 
sectarian, which is why it isn't the Muslim Right, or the Jewish 
Right, however much the three faiths may have in common. And 
"panicked" is probably a defensible term to describe a movement deeply 
concerned by a rise of 400 per cent in serious crimes during the past 
generation and 300 per cent in illegitimate births. The word 
"panicked" is subjectively used, of course. Only three days ago, one 
newspaper report informed us that President Clinton was "panicked" at 
the prospect of General Powell's running. We have to assume that a 
metaphor was intended, given that nobody caught Bill Clinton about to 
throw himself out the window.
<p>
But the reference by Bill Safire is confusing, the business about 
"that old abortion-and-school-prayer set." Either he is saying that 
there should be term limits on concern over abortion and school 
prayer, or else he is saying that the questions have been debated and 
are behind us. It isn't that Mr. Safire is indisposed to stay in a 
battle for as long as it takes. He was a doughty soldier during the 
Cold War, which began many years before Roe v. Wade, but Safire was in 
there right up until the Berlin Wall came down, God bless him, and if 
it takes a hundred years to guarantee the safety of Israel, we cannot 
reasonably doubt that Bill Safire's great-grandchildren will be 
sounding the Zionist bell, and more power to them. If he is saying 
that, on the contrary, people ought to give up on school prayer, there 
are those who respectfully disagree, among them -- who knows? -- God!, 
who is contingently capable of influencing elections. And a call to 
acknowledge human life in the fetus isn't a question of the kind one 
ought to get bored about unless research absolutely establishes that, 
all the time, a fetus was really no different from a tomato.
<p>
The right-wing gentlemen who met last week to serve notice on General 
Powell that he had made references disquieting to them, honorable 
representatives of conservative positions within the GOP, spoke 
respectably on the issues to which they have devoted themselves for 
many years. They didn't raise a single question about General Powell 
that hadn't been raised, that same week, by George Will, but Mr. 
Safire and Miss Dowd and the Miami Herald have an instinctive sense -- 
maybe it was sharpened by reading General Powell's autobiography? -- 
who to pick on when Mom has an accident on the highway, and who to let 
alone.<p>

<i>NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 14</i>
<hr>
<h2>X-Ray Time</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
It is useful to examine the federal deadlock through a strictly 
democratic prism.
<p>
1. We have a separation of powers that authorizes Congress uniquely to 
pass legislation; and a subdivision here that authorizes only the 
House of Representatives to write bills that will cost money.
<p>
2. The President is authorized to veto any bill presented to him by 
Congress. To override a presidential veto requires two-thirds of the 
vote in each house.
<p>
3. In the existing situation, a majority of both houses passes a 
measure that would simultaneously do a great many things, including 
program an increase in payments required by the public to sustain 
Medicaid and Medicare.
<p>
4. The President exercises his veto, complaining specifically about 
the measure's health-care provisions.
<p>
5. Congressional leadership asks itself: Given that an override of the 
veto cannot be recruited, how might Congress force its hand on the 
President?
<p>
Force its hand!? Yes, that is what Messrs. Dole and Gingrich are 
saying in effect, because they are seeking to implement what they 
understand as strict instructions from the American people. They are 
to move toward balancing the budget, and their plan for doing so is 
blocked by the President's power.
<p>
But Congress also has power. The continuation of federal activity, 
including the health benefits, requires financing. It is generally 
assumed that so-called entitlements are inertial forces that cannot be 
interrupted. But the forward movement of those forces requires 
constant propulsion, and this is doable only by appropriations by 
Congress.
<p>
The leadership is quite confident that its mandate hasn't withered 
since it was enunciated in the November election. A national survey 
done by Public Opinion Strategies only a week ago reveals that 66 per 
cent of Americans favor "balancing the budget [even] if that means 
that spending on Medicare and Medicaid would continue to increase but 
at a lower rate." Accordingly, Congress uses its trump card and 
freezes spending at the highest level authorized by a preceding 
Congress, i.e., at 4.9 trillion borrowed dollars.
<p>
So: The people voted, Congress acted, the President vetoed, Congress 
used its primordial power.
<p>
In a parliamentary system, such an impasse would be quickly solved. 
The parliament would be dissolved, an election scheduled. If the party 
upholding a balanced budget prevailed in that election, the prime 
minister would resign and be replaced by a member of the validated 
party. If otherwise, the prime minister would be back with a compliant 
legislature. But then, the prime minister wouldn't be occupying the 
executive mansion unless placed there by the ruling faction in the 
legislature. What we face today is what the British would call a 
constitutional crisis.
<p>
The public has not yet been discomfited, and no one will be for a 
period, the exception being 800,000 furloughed federal workers. The 
Treasury secretary is maneuvering and isn't likely to run out of gas 
unless a major creditor nation decides that there is too much harum-
scarum going on and, instead of holding its reserves in dollars, 
switches to yen, or marks, or pounds sterling.
<p>
What we do have is high-pitched political theater. The people are 
vaguely aware of the instructions they gave to the new Congress, but 
they are, with various degrees of intensity, concerned with medical 
care, and that element of Americans most concerned is of course the 
senior citizens, and it is they who exercise critical clout. The 
President is relying on his incantatory evocations of starving 
children and homeless old people, with here and there a tear shed for 
what used to be Yellowstone Park. Presidential indignation makes its 
way quickly to the headlines.
<p>
By contrast, it is Congress that is held to be the agent of all those 
things, and we come quickly on the supreme irony, which is that 
references are almost inevitably to the "rigid," the "defiant," the 
"reckless" Congress, the complement of the lonely, single defender of 
the people's interest. There was never a better example of everybody 
being out of step except Johnny.<p>

<i>NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 17</i>
<hr>
<h2>25 Hours at Sea</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>

<P>
Countdown time. In little more than a week, the government of the 
United States is scheduled to close down, there having been an impasse 
between the Executive Branch of government and the Legislative Branch. 
An esteemed world leader is assassinated, resulting in an Air Force 
One flight to Israel. Lo and behold, in the very same airplane are: 
the leader of the Executive Branch and the two leaders of the 
Legislative Branch. 
<P>
They will be 25 hours in the same airplane! Could it be that the God 
Jehovah planned it that way? The golden opportunity to come together, 
35,000 feet up in the air, a thousand miles away from the nearest air 
field, and spend some time discussing the future of the Republic? 
<P>
But protocol reigns, and the airplane belongs, so to speak, to the 
leader of the Executive Branch; the two leaders of the Legislature are 
on board as guests. The initiative, therefore, has to come from the 
host.
<P>
But he doesn't approach them. Why? Well, we are told, he was grieving 
the loss of the slain world leader. The President of the United States 
could not drive from his mind his concern for intra-Israeli 
reconciliation. During the 12 hours heading east all he could think of 
was -- Hebron. To that problem, and the surrounding problem of the 
West Bank, he bent his mighty political powers -- that, and his 
concern for the grieving widow and children. 
<P>
On the journey back, the doctor told the President he simply had to 
make an effort -- as a sacrifice for his country -- to distract 
himself from his preoccupation with Israeli fratricide. He needed 
therapy. And, since Bill Clinton is a soldier, even if he never went 
through formal basic training, he consented to make the effort, but 
stipulated that the only game he would consent to play was Hearts, 
which reminded him of the valentines he used to exchange with the 
slain prime minister. 
<P>
Meanwhile, at the other end of the plane the two legislative leaders 
fidgeted, wondering when the President would come in, or else summon 
them to his quarters, to put it all out on the table. There isn't that 
much time left! is what was going through their minds. They looked out 
the window and saw Ireland go by, no summons. A couple of hours later 
they spotted Gander. Then Nova Scotia. Then Long Island. They 
permitted themselves to wonder whether a deal could be made between 
Long Island and Andrews Air Force Base, which after all was 90 minutes 
away, time enough to come up with something that would put off the 
crisis for a couple of weeks, maybe. 
<P>
At that point Senator Dole is said to have turned to Newt and 
suggested that maybe the President could be persuaded to meet with 
them in Dayton to discuss the problem. But Newt was getting a little 
fed up and said there wouldn't be any rooms available in Dayton, not 
till all those Serbs and Croats and Muslims were out of there. Dole 
nodded and was about to suggest an alternative meeting place when an 
aide appeared, with the landing instructions. 
<P>
They couldn't believe it! It was stipulated that the two leaders of 
the Legislature should disembark from the rear of the airplane. At 
first they reasoned that the purpose for this was to avoid any body 
contact with the President that might result in impetuous bargaining 
over what to do about the close of government at midnight. But no, Bob 
Dole said, there's no realistic fear of that happening, since there 
will be too much hustle and bustle getting out of the plane. There has 
to be some other motive. After all, in Israel we all disembarked up 
front. To change that plan now suggests a motive. 
<P>
Newt looked up. He had got the idea! He was a historian, he told Bob, 
and he knew something about affronts on a major scale, and this was 
one of them. It hasn't absolutely been established, but there are 
revisionists out there who are convinced that Brutus acted as he did 
because of the inferior box Julius Caesar had stuck him in at the 
Colosseum's opening on the Ides of February. The President, he said, 
is trying to provoke us! He doesn't want reconciliation, he wants a 
public shoot-out with as many blasts on TV as he can get out of it! 
<P>
Senator Dole furrowed his brow. There was always an alternative, he 
said. We could let the budget stay unbalanced? 
<P>
Newt shook his head. No. We'll follow the lead of Caesar, and see what 
happens.

<i>NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 21</i>
<hr>
<h2>McNamara's Final Surrender</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>

<P>
Robert McNamara has every right to publish a book advising the world 
that in his opinion we had been wrong, "terribly wrong," in engaging 
in war in Vietnam. But what more can be said about the liberties of 
Bob McNamara? He is free, if he is so impelled, to join the Communist 
Party; or to form one, if it no longer exists. What is creepy about 
his most recent exercise in self-mortification is the auspices under 
which it is being done. 
<P>
If you missed it, Mr. McNamara went to Vietnam, alongside a few other 
dignitaries whose names do not get into the papers, under the auspices 
of the Council on Foreign Relations. The announced purpose was to 
explore whether the war might have ended sooner, or indeed might have 
been averted altogether.
<P>
Now I am a member, however inert, of the Council on Foreign Relations, 
and I wonder why it should sponsor on a trip to Vietnam someone who 
has publicly abjured the reasoning of Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, 
Johnson, and Nixon, and the overwhelming majority of their advisors, 
on why the operation in Vietnam was justified. Inasmuch as Mr. 
McNamara received approximately 100 per cent of the publicity of the 
visiting delegation, the world has quite reasonably concluded that his 
oblation constitutes an official apology by the United States for 
acting as it did.
<P>
Well, the world is wrong; Mr. McNamara arrived with no such portfolio. 
When a few days ago Japan finally elected to apologize for Japanese 
conduct in Korea during and before the Second World War, the apology 
was tendered by the prime minister and represented official government 
opinion. McNamara's sole credential was as one representative of the 
Council on Foreign Relations. Several questions arise. The first is, 
What is the purpose in sending on a mission to investigate tensions 
with Vietnam an American who has publicly rejected, indeed scorned, 
the reason for such tensions? He wholly rejects the reasoning of the 
President who made him secretary of defense, the successor President 
who in 1964 was elected by a landslide in part because of his 
reaffirmation of the policy of containment, pronounced twenty years 
earlier by President Truman calling for resistance to Communist 
aggression whether in Greece, in Berlin, in Iran, in Guatemala, in 
Korea -- or in Vietnam.
<P>
It would have been interesting if our former secretary of defense, in 
his meeting with General Giap -- essentially Vietnam's secretary of 
defense -- had met as old football coaches might have done to exchange 
locker-room talk about what might have worked in this situation, what 
in that situation. But Mr. McNamara wasn't in Vietnam to say to Giap, 
"You proved the better soldier." He was there as the prominent 
American whose support of the war, advertised so proudly while in 
office, had mutated, after thirty tortuous years, into a profound 
rejection of all the premises of that war. If a Christian theologian 
decides, at age 78, that on second thought he doesn't really think 
Christ was the Redeemer, he isn't very useful as a delegate to a 
conference inquiring into the causes of impiety. And there is no 
evidence that Mr. McNamara ever thought to ask General Giap such 
questions as, Since I have retreated from my moral position about 
going to war, have you retreated from yours about treating the people 
of Vietnam like slaves?
<P>
In 1964, McNamara absolutely affirmed that the Vietnamese were 
responsible for a second assault on an American naval vessel on August 
4, 1964. He now declares that he is "overwhelmingly" convinced that no 
such assault actually occurred. And who does he ask to confirm his 
reversal? Why, the man who would have engineered the Tonkin Gulf 
attack. It happens that I am a student, however superficial, of the 
Tonkin Gulf episode, and I am convinced it never happened, but I am 
deeply convinced that the military and the Administration did 
genuinely believe it had happened. But the idea of going to Giap to 
ask for final judgment in the matter is the equivalent of going to 
Goering at Nuremberg and asking, Did you really slaughter six million 
Jews?
<P>
There is no effective way absolutely to teach people what manners are 
appropriate in what situations. I mean, there are several hundred 
thousand wives, fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, sons, daughters 
who lost their husband, offspring, sibling, father in Vietnam. And 
they are justly solaced by their conviction that the fight was made in 
pursuit of a most honorable cause, i.e., to spare the people of South 
Vietnam the miseries of living under such as General Giap and Ho Chi 
Minh, while continuing to maintain the animating strategic policy of 
the Cold War. We lost the battle in Vietnam, but won the war -- 
finally -- not least because the enemy had at least a temporary 
experience of American resolution in Southeast Asia.

<html><title>Buckley:  The Hot Plotters</title></head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>

<i>NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 28</i>
<hr>
<h2>The Hot Plotters</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>
The search for a greater choice of presidential candidates can't reach 
more desperate lengths than the situation reported over the weekend, 
namely that a Hot Plot has been hatching by means of telephone 
conference calls. Of the seven players who participated in these 
calls, reported to have lasted two hours each, three are relatively 
unknown, the others being Bill Bradley, Gary Hart, Paul Tsongas, and 
Lowell Weicker.
<P>
Time magazine reports that in their last telephone conference, it 
couldn't be settled which of the plotters should enter his name in the 
formal contest. About Senator Bradley there is this problem, namely 
that he would put his audience to sleep if he recited King Harry's 
speech to his soldiers at Agincourt. Mr. Bradley was recently in 
California testing the waters. He found them uniformly cold, if that 
is the right word for waters that react not at all to the finger stuck 
in them seeking Delphic encouragement. 
<P>
Gary Hart, of course, has troubles that date back to his hubristic 
outing on the yacht Monkey Business, the design of which caper has to 
have been to prove that the American voters don't care any more about 
adultery than they are supposed to care about abortion. To be sure, 
Senator Hart, unlike most of the others on the party line last Sunday, 
is a charismatic political campaigner. But when the opportunity came 
up earlier in the year to run for the Senate from his home state, 
Colorado, he decided to pass it up. If you can't count on your home 
state for senator, it doesn't make much sense to go for 26 states.
<P>
Paul Tsongas is an attractive former senator who fired off a Roman 
candle or two during the Democratic primaries in 1992 by calling for a 
reduced federal deficit. He ran into the usual problem, which is that 
most voters are a) in favor of a balanced budget, and b) in favor of 
everything that causes the budget to be unbalanced. In any event, Mr. 
Tsongas has medical problems which are said to have caused him to rule 
himself out as the candidate of the Hot Plotters.
<P>
Lowell Weicker did succeed when he ran as an independent for governor 
of Connecticut, soon after his defeat for re-election as senator at 
the hands of Joseph Lieberman. Governor Weicker's reign calls to mind 
the blurb written by Evelyn Waugh for his friend Nancy Mitford's 
novel. "In 1945," Mr. Waugh wrote, "Miss Mitford voted the socialist 
ticket. Having done her best to make England uninhabitable, she went 
to France to live." It was Mr. Weicker who instituted the income tax 
in Connecticut, which has served no purpose other than to make the 
state less genial than it once was to middle-class residents and to 
corporations, many of which have fled. There is this additional 
problem, which is that Mr. Weicker is the most obnoxious moralist 
since Savonarola, suggesting that any deviation from whatever was his 
most recent political epiphany marks the dissenter as a cretin. 
<P>
So where do we go from here? As regards Bradley - Hart - Tsongas - 
Weicker, the answer is: absolutely nowhere. What their putative 
coalition is meant to say is that there is (their word) a "huge" 
hunger for the kind of politics they represent. How does one reduce 
this agenda into idiomatic political language? Well, the easiest way 
to put it is that they are anti-Newt.
<P>
The Speaker has been having a rough time of it in recent days, and 
some of it is his fault. It isn't a fault you'd score against a 
philosopher, who happily comes up with reticulate bearings to help to 
understand any phenomenon. Years ago, wondering about some political 
quandary, I asked a distinguished historian to trace the cause of the 
problem and he replied unhesitantly, "William of Occam." He meant by 
this the introduction of relativist thought engendered by the denial 
of universals in the fourteenth century.
<P>
Okay, but of course Mr. Gingrich is supposed to speak in an idiomatic 
mode, and when someone calls to his attention a quite awful specimen 
of human depravity, it is not wise, let alone prudent, for him to cite 
federal welfare as the progenitive cause, even if, in a seminar, a 
professor might persuasively track depravity back to welfare, back to 
original sin. But of course the trouble with an etiological search so 
comprehensively concerned to identify the prime cause of human 
misbehavior is that it could finger Newt Gingrich as suffering from 
the sin of intellectual pride.
<P>
But the surviving point has got to be that the courage and the stamina 
of the Speaker have given the voters a vision of something truly 
distinctive from such an awful stew as one gets from the Hot Plotters, 
who don't even have an interesting idiosyncrasy to call attention to 
them.

<hr>
<h2>Have You Ever Had Terminal Blah Time?</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>
We confront, from our pillars of light, every problem that plagues or 
threatens to plague mankind, of every variety. Columnists have written 
on how best to avoid a war or how best to become involved in a war or 
how best to make a Floating Island. With less than a few keystrokes, 
the opinion makers can redesign the Cathedral of Chartres, advising 
where all the mistakes were made, and how they might be avoided. 
Scientific contentions having to do with the best mineral for 
preserving human teeth can become causes celcbres and contestants will 
stand their ground with all their weapons oiled, well poised to 
discredit a silly argument from the other side. But what happens when 
you are sick? 
<P>
A bizarre question, because incapacitating illnesses don't . . . seem 
to happen. We are all familiar with the law that the charismatic 
leader must appear to be immune to the abrasions that hinder mere men 
and women. Sensing this, though the idea was not yet explicated, FDR 
took pains to disguise his infirmity. Fidel Castro, we learned soon 
after his ascendancy in Cuba, simply cancelled all public engagements 
when feeling ill. In such a society as he rules over, it is easier to 
do this than it would be, say, in America, where arbitrary action is 
accepted only when caused by nature. You can cancel a game in the 
World Series because a hurricane got in the way, but not because Joe 
DiMaggio didn't feel well. In 1985 in Washington the weather was so 
cold that the whole inaugural parade was put off. That meant the 
President could not take his oath of office in the usual place, so he 
took it instead in the rotunda of the House of Representatives. And 
everyone knew that it was actually a re-enactment, because the 
constitutional date for taking the office had come the day before, but 
they don't like doing these things on a Sunday.
<P>
But what if one were really sick? A gentleman sent down two weeks ago 
for execution pleaded a postponement on the grounds that he was 
suffering from a terrible head cold and could not take in his own 
execution and that surely this was one of the designs of death-
sentence architects. Suppose that the Queen of England were to be 
crowned on Tuesday and that morning she announced to the Court that 
she simply was not up to it, that sitting up there on the throne for 
two or three hours would constitute a torture she'd find unbearable. 
What then?
<P>
What if she faced the same hideous plight as the columnist stricken 
with some combination of cold, sinus, nose-clog, throat-tightening 
even after two days of antibiotics, when time comes for him to produce 
. . . a column? 
<P>
There are ways to go that dramatize your immobility. Wanda Landowska 
slightly messed up one fugue from a sonata and then closed her 
harpsichord, permanently. Toscanini reacted similarly to a lapse of 
memory. Franz Liszt decided he would no longer perform before large 
audiences and ostentatiously pulled down the piano cover after he was 
through. The statesman of high office is less prone to apocalyptic 
departures from public life, though Charles de Gaulle did that 
exactly. 
<P>
What irks the quotidian analyst is the triviality of the challenge. I 
am not John McCain, whom one would have understood if he had ended any 
attempt at communication after five years in the Vietnamese prison 
camps. It is just, in the great scheme of things, one spark plug that 
won't ignite, not even after submitting it to the one-hundredth 
homeopathic distraction. 
<P>
So that, burrow as you might in these lines in search of an apercu 
worth pocketing, forgive me; my cupboard is bare. <p>

<html><title>Buckley:  Who Is to Blame?  -- 12/19/95</title></head>

<hr>
<h2>Who Is to Blame?</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>
On the program 60 Minutes, a half-dozen retiring legislators submitted 
to friendly interrogation inquiring into the reason for their decision 
to give it all up, go home. Most of their complaints we are familiar 
with. Unquestionably the most searing is the business about money: 
Senator Alan Simpson reported that a senator has to raise a minimum of 
$10,000 every week, which is a heavy load. When you consider 10 thou 
times 52 times 6 that adds up to over $3 million -- which is only one-
third of what retiring Senator Paul Simon had to spend to get back 
into the Senate. 
<P>
Is that situation inherently corrupt? Not a bad question. One senator 
put it this way. He gets back to his hotel at 10 P.M. after a hard day 
of electioneering and he has twenty telephone messages, all of them 
from strangers. But one name he does recognize, because that goodbody 
had donated $1,000 to the senator's campaign. The senator has the 
energy left, at that time of night -- after such a day -- to make one 
phone call, so whom does he call? Right. And even if it happened that 
the caller's message was, Please vote in favor of Measure X, and the 
senator goes out and votes against Measure X, it still remains that 
the only person who got through to him was a Measure X enthusiast, and 
enthusiasms have a way of communicating themselves, not least when 
fueled with thousand-dollar bills. Is there a way to stop all that? 
No, not under our system. It could be changed only by going to a 
parliamentary system on the British model.
<P>
But a less conventional complaint of some of the retiring gentlemen 
had to do with the under-celebrated art of compromise. People just 
don't understand, one man put it, that politics is -- you guessed it, 
the art of compromise. The gentlemen being interviewed were too polite 
to say it in exactly as many words, but what they were criticizing was 
the Gingrich House. To use bald figures, one had the impression that 
if Gingrich would simply give up on tax reform, he'd get substantially 
what he wanted in the way of tax reform. 
<P>
And of course compromise is the civilized approach to most 
controversies, but the operative word in that sentence is "most." And 
the entrenched mood of the congressmen who do not wish to compromise 
with Mr. Clinton is reinforced by the rhetoric used by Mr. Clinton and 
his satellites. It could be that your call to reduce medical expenses 
by $270 billion in seven years could be adulterated a little, say to 
$250 billion in eight years, that kind of thing -- do it, take a deep 
breath, and sigh resignedly over the rough nature of democratic 
compromise. 
<P>
But to engender receptivity for the compromise mode requires 
rhetorical adaptation at the other end, and this President Clinton is 
ostentatiously declining to do. He speaks instead of Republicans 
wishing to cut medical services for the aged and the indigent, using 
words appropriate to a situation in which Congress was planning to 
sequester a million people every year in a huge federal compound and 
let them die there of starvation and exposure. Slowly. 
<P>
Even the most dogged defenders of state welfarism here and there break 
under the strain. The New Republic's editorialist, remarking on the 
success Mr. Clinton is having with his phony scare tactics, lays the 
final blame on the voting public. "The only people being fundamentally 
irresponsible in the recent -- and continuing -- budget battle are the 
American people. They are, to borrow a phrase from our colleague 
Michael Kinsley, big babies. A year ago, in a realigning election, 
voters ushered in a Republican Congress that had pledged, in complete 
candor, to balance the federal budget. In the days before that 
election, voters backed Republicans over Democrats by a 2.8 per cent 
margin. Then the Republicans made a fatal error: they tried to deliver 
on their promise. The result is that in the last few months, the party 
positions have been completely reversed. The Democrats now lead by 2.4 
per cent." 
<P>
But then whom do you blame for the people's immaturity? The 
editorialist suggests it is the people themselves who are to blame, 
for wanting one thing and authorizing another. "Speaker Gingrich, for 
all his failings, is the first American politician actually to 
confront the public with the reality. For that, he gets an approval 
rating of 27 per cent." Any effort to bail out the American people for 
this act of irresponsibility would have to reason to the people's 
ignorance for believing what their President has been telling them, 
six times a day, for the past six weeks. If the voters believe Clinton 
is correct -- that passage of the Contract with America will result in 
agony and death for uncounted hundreds of thousands of Americans -- 
then they are right to say no to Mr. Gingrich. 
<P>
And the problem becomes: What to do about demagogues in the White 
House? Vote them out of office? Yes, but what will inform the voters 
that that is the thing to do?<p>

<hr>
<h2>The Inside War</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>

The sequence is roughly as follows:
<P>
1. Senator Dole makes a statement: He will not, in 1996, urge the GOP 
to endorse a constitutional amendment that would ban the practice of 
abortion. 
<P>
Buzz . . . Why is Bob doing this? He needs the right wing of his party 
to get nominated . . . No, stupid, he is thinking about the election 
now. He has already won the nomination. He is following Nixon's rule: 
Woo the Right in order to be nominated, the Left in order to be 
elected. 
<P>
2. Ralph Reed, the Executive Director of the Christian Coalition, 
fires immediately. "Senator Dole's remarks not only represent an 
uncharacteristic departure from his previous record, but a stunning 
reversal from the winning Reagan position that has sustained the 
Republican Party for 15 years and helped make it a majority party. Not 
a single pro-life incumbent of either political party lost in 1994 and 
1995. Senator Dole is also the only leading candidate who has declined 
to sign a pledge that he supports the pro-life plank in the Republican 
Party platform." 
<P>
The sentence of the court was duly executed: "The Christian Coalition 
will distribute 22 million voter guides in the presidential primaries 
next winter and spring. Those voter guides will accurately reflect 
Senator Dole's and other candidates' positions on this issue." The 
next day, the Dole campaign "clarified" its candidate's remarks.
<P>
3. Noemie Emery ("a freelance writer living in New York") writes a 
lead article for The Weekly Standard. Early in its career, The 
Standard published an eloquent editorial affirming the pro-life 
position. Miss Emery says in effect, Look. Though we rightly consider 
the fetus a human being, it is something less than that exactly, and 
under the circumstances different moral perspectives are 
understandably brought to bear on the question, and the GOP should 
drop its categorical position and settle, instead, for progressive 
restrictions, leading in the right direction. 
<P>
Irving Kristol, a few days later, in an eloquent article in the Wall 
Street Journal berating the excesses of modern secularists, then asks, 
What are the mistakes of the other side? There are several. "Whatever 
one's views on abortion, it is clear that public opinion, today and 
for the foreseeable future, will not accept its criminalization." He 
upbraids his fellow conservatives: "By permitting their passions to 
dominate the issue, by converting their commitment to a 'right to 
life' crusade rather than to policy, they have made the best the enemy 
of the good -- a common error of zealotry in politics."
<P>
4. NATIONAL REVIEW sees in the Emery article a "part of a continuing 
effort to revise the Republican platform. Last year conservatives 
William Kristol and George Weigel suggested in NATIONAL REVIEW that 
pro-lifers focus on more readily achievable objectives such as 
parental-consent laws or bans on third-trimester abortions. Pro-lifers 
could debate the prudence of this position within the context of 
shared objectives: a reduction in the number of abortions and legal 
recognition of the practice's injustice." 
<P>
But the editors make two points, one of them transcendent in 
character: "Miss Emery and Mr. Bennett would reach a different 
judgment on abortion, and the reason is plain to everyone but them: 
they evidently do not regard abortion as 'wrong' in the same sense 
that infanticide is wrong." And a most telling empirical political 
point: If the strategic design of the pro-lifers is to win the fight 
with progressive tactical strikes, they are entitled to ask, "Where is 
a comparable modesty or prudence on the other side? Where is the 
willingness, on the part of Senators Kennedy and Specter, to accept 
restraints even on a handful of abortions, such as the grisly 'partial 
birth' abortions? The fact of the matter is that Noemie Emery and 
William Bennett have no audience on the pro-choice side. The pro-
choicers will not concede even the slightest restriction on abortion, 
because any restriction implies its wrongness." 
<P>
Kremlinologists can divert themselves by reflecting that William 
Kristol was a trustee of NATIONAL REVIEW until he became the 
(founding) editor of The Standard, that he is the son of Irving 
Kristol, that William Bennett was for several years a Senior Editor of 
NATIONAL REVIEW, that Bennett -- and Kennedy! -- are both Catholics, 
that George Weigel is a theologically trained Catholic, that Ralph 
Reed and Bob Dole are Protestants, the Kristols Jewish: and, of 
course, all of them Republicans. Just one more example of hegemonic 
conservative thought.<p>

<h2>Black Racism Goes Largely Unchallenged </h2> 
<P>by <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 



 
"The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color 
line," W.E.B. Du Bois predicted in 1900. Unfortunately, his words 
still ring true in 1996 but with a bitter irony. In 1900 blacks stood 
on one side of the color line as victims of racism. Today, increasing 
numbers of blacks have crossed over the line to become perpetrators of 
racism as well. And while we have become far more courageous in 
condemning and punishing racism when it is practiced by whites, black 
racism goes largely unchallenged. Witness the reactions to two 
murderous attacks by racists last month.
<p>
In the first incident, two white soldiers are accused of viciously 
murdering a black couple in Fayetteville, N.C., because the men hated 
blacks. The murder was front-page news across the country and led the 
evening network broadcasts. The Army, concerned the suspects might be 
part of an organized network of white supremacists, launched a full-
scale investigation to weed out any racist fringe groups.
<p>
The second incident took place just one day after the racially 
motivated murder of the black couple in North Carolina. A black man 
entered a white-owned store in Harlem, warning blacks to leave, before 
he opened fire on the mostly Hispanic and white employees and 
customers and then set the store ablaze. When the conflagration ended, 
eight people, including the gunman, were dead. The story generated 
only moderate news attention outside New York and little national 
soul-searching about the causes or prevalence of black racism. Only a 
small handful of national columnists deemed the racial aspects of the 
homicidal rampage worthy of specific condemnation, and most of these 
were black journalists.
<p>
If the Harlem murders were an isolated event, the reluctance of so 
many white opinion leaders to confront black racism might be 
understandable. But black-on-white hate crimes have increased 
dramatically. In one study by Klanwatch, a liberal civil rights group 
that monitors racist incidents, nearly half the racially motivated 
murders over three years were committed by blacks, who are only 12% of 
the population.
<p>
Media reticence to condemn black racism reflects an insidious double 
standard. White racism is rightly viewed as a moral failing of the 
individual and as a threat to both the peace and justice of society. 
But many in the media seem reluctant to gauge black racism in the same 
way.
<p>
For weeks before the attack on the white-owned Harlem store, 
demonstrators marched in front of the building, shouting racist and 
anti-Semitic remarks. According to the testimony of the Jewish store 
owner, who sought a restraining order against the demonstrators prior 
to the murders, protesters "made motions of striking a match and 
throwing it on the outside clothing displays or into the doorway of 
the store." Days before the actual arson, he warned prophetically: "At 
some point real matches will be thrown at me and my store. This is not 
an idle fear on my part."<p>     But in the heart of the media capital of 
the world - New York City - this story of vicious hate-mongering went 
unreported until after the fire. Is it imaginable that a similar story 
of white protesters making such threatening gestures outside a black-
owned establishment would be ignored by the media?
<p>
In some circles, blacks are presumed incapable of racism because they 
lack power. But racism is about hate, not power. It takes hate, not 
power, to shoot an innocent couple on a deserted street or set fire to 
a store full of frightened people.
<p>
And it takes considerable cowardice not to recognize hate comes in all 
colors. 
<P>

<html><head><title>Chavez:  'Dynamic' Newest Banned Word --1/4/96
</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>




<center><i>January 10, 1996</i>

<h2>'Dynamic' Newest Banned Word</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 
 

Bethesda, Md. - Warning: Radical feminists have added a new word to 
their lexicon of forbidden terms. "Dynamic" now joins "seminal," 
"mankind" and "hysterical" among other "sexist" expressions that 
feminists want to expunge from our vocabularies.
<P>
This most recent skirmish in the feminist language war erupted at 
Chico State University in California, where the philosophy department 
recently advertised for "a dynamic classroom teacher and program 
builder" to teach the "philosophy of feminism." The ad drew fire from 
a feminist English professor and the university's affirmative action 
director, who charged that the word "dynamic" described a "kinetic, 
dramatic style" most often associated with white males. University 
administrators, not wanting to offend, rewrote the ad, substituting 
"excellent" for "dynamic," but the controversy didn't end there. The 
local newspaper put the story on Page One, and even the usually 
liberal San Francisco Chronicle editorialized against adding "dynamic" 
to "the growing list of socially unacceptable words."
<P>
The whole episode might be amusing if it weren't part of a serious - 
and successful - propaganda campaign to change not only the way we 
talk but also the way we thingk. As George Orwell noted 50 years ago 
in his famous essay "Politics and the English Language". "If thought 
corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought." And corrupting 
thought is what radical feminism is all about.
<P>
Feminists fully understand their mission. "The political implications 
of language have made linguistic study imperative for feminists," 
intones the Women's Study Encyclopedia in an essay on "Feminism and 
Semiological Theory." For those uninitiated in contemporary academic 
jargon, semiotics is a theory of language that asserts that words are 
symbols representing not only the things they describe but, more 
importantly, the values of the dominant class within a culture. If you 
wnat to change the values of a culture, you must change its language. 
And feminists have been trying to change ours for a generation.
<P>
We've all but abandoned sex-specific terms in public usage. Firemen 
and policemen have disappeared, even though they account for 98% of 
fire department personnel and 84% of those in police departments. Miss 
and Mrs. have given way to the nondescript and dissonant Ms. Official 
Washington has banished its chairmen and spokesmen. And most editors 
would rather break grammar rules than offend feminists, substituting 
"they" for the generic "he" when a third person singular pronoun is 
required. (One copy editor actually suggested that I use the pronoun 
"it" when referring to a non-specific child.) Even "mother" and 
"father" are becomng endangered terms, replaced by the less 
descriptive "parent."
<P>
Sex itself is being quickly supplanted by "gender" - which in 
feministspeak refers to an arbitrary social construct. As the Women's 
Study Encyclopedia puts it: "To many, gender continues to be read as 
synonymous with sex." But not to radical feminists, for whom "the 
relation between sex and gender has becmoe the central question for 
contemporary feminist theory as a whole." The idea is to abolish 
differences between men and wom,en, even those rooted in nature. And 
the first step is to break down distinctions in language - to 
"deconstruct" language, in another favorite phrase from the jargon of 
the academic left.
<P>
Author and philosophy professor Christina Hoff Sommers, whose book 
"Who Stole Feminism?" is a biting critique of radical feminists on 
campus, makes the distinction between what she calls "gender 
feminists" and "equity feminists." The former see themselves as 
victims of a culture totally dominated by men, and their objective is 
to transform that culture, using language as a tool to reconstruct 
society in their image.
<P>
"Equity feminists," on the other hand, simply want women to have equal 
legal rights with men and the same opportunities as men to make the 
most of their own individual talents. Unfortunately, the gender 
feminists have the upper hand in universities across the country, and 
their influence spills over into the broader culture day by day.

The attempt to neuter language, or to put certain words off limits 
because they ostensibly represent masculine traits, is an exercise in 
thought control. Totalitarianism didn't disappear with the collapse of 
the Soviet Union. It's alive and well on many American college 
campuses today.

<h2>Hillary Furor: Greed, Not Deception, At Issue</h2> 
<P>by <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> Linda  Chavez



 
 
The entire Washington press corps and scores of politicians 
seem obsessed the last few weeks with finding out whether Hillary 
Clinton is telling the truth. But deception isn't the heart of 
the scandals and controversies swirling around the first lady - 
greed is. The Clintons' greed, as well as that of their friends, 
is the root of the problems afflicting the first couple, from 
Whitewater, to Hillary's dubious commodity trades, to the firing 
of White House travel office personnel. This an old-fashioned 
story about graft and corruption - the kind that has been the 
undoing of many a politician. 
 <P>
The trouble began in 1978, when Bill Clinton was the poorly 
paid, young attorney general of Arkansas and Hillary was not yet 
the $ 125-an-hour partner in the successful Rose Law Firm. James 
McDougal, an Arkansas businessman with more chutzpah than 
scruples, approached the couple with an offer they couldn't 
refuse: Become business partners in a potentially lucrative land 
deal, and he'd make them rich. 
 <P>
The Clintons had no real money to invest - they didn't even 
own a home - but that didn't matter. McDougal was willing to give 
them a 50% share of 230 acres on the White River, to be purchased 
entirely with borrowed money from a bank willing to accept the 
partners' signatures as collateral for a $ 203,000 loan. (Try 
that with your local bank the next time you see property you'd 
like to own but can't afford.) 
 <P>
Although both Bill and Hillary graduated with honors from Yale 
Law School, they seem not to have questioned the legality, much 
less propriety, of accepting something for nothing. Nor did the 
Clintons trouble themselves about ethics as the land deal went 
sour, requiring more shady borrowing, and their business partner 
McDougal became enmeshed in the savings and loan scandal that 
cost taxpayers billions. 
 <P>
Although Whitewater itself never produced the profits McDougal 
promised, it gave the Clintons some hefty tax write-offs as their 
incomes increased with Hillary's growing law practice. And 
McDougal even threw Hillary some legal business as well, a 
$2,000-per-month retainer he says the then-governor personally 
solicited (though Bill Clinton denies it). 
 <P>
And while Whitewater didn't become a cash cow, Hillary made a 
bundle in another bovine adventure: the cattle futures commodity 
market. The Clintons reaped a $ 100,000 profit on a $ 1,000 
investment, again with help from an Arkansas businessman, James 
Blair. As general counsel of Tyson's Foods, one of Arkansas' 
biggest employers and an industry regulated by the state, Blair 
did plenty of business with the state while he was fattening the 
Clintons' bank account. Neither the governor nor his 
attorney-wife questioned the lawfulness of letting Blair place 
trades on Hillary's behalf or pocketing the proceeds. 
 <P>
Even Travelgate boils down to greed - on the part of Clinton 
chums, if not the president and his wife. Although most of the 
attention has focused on whether Hillary Clinton ordered the 
firing of the White House travel office staff, there's much more 
to the story. An article by Byron York in the Jan. 22 issue of 
The Weekly Standard documents the attempt by a Clinton friend and 
his business associate to take over all of the federal 
government's non-military aircraft business, not just the 
chartered press travel run out of the White House. Had the flap 
not developed when the White House firings took place, this plan 
would have gone forward, netting millions of dollars in profits 
to Clinton's friends. 
 <P>
The Clintons may have railed against the Republicans' "decade 
of greed," but all the while they were trying to line their own - 
and their friends' - pockets.

<h2>Children Do Suffer Most From a Divorce </h2> 
<P> <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>
<br><p> 


As unusual as Michael Jackson's marriage to Lisa Marie Presley seemed 
in 1994, their impending divorce, announced last week, is all too 
commonplace. The superstar duo have become just one more statistic 
among the 1.2 million American couples who divorce each year.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With no little Jacksons to suffer the consequence of their breakup and 
a prenuptual agreement to protect each party's property, the couple's 
split is hardly cause for any public concern.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the approximately 700,000 
marriages involving children that dissolve every year.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These divorces are more than personal tragedies. They are a social 
problem with significant societal costs.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More than one in two marriages in the United States now end in divorce 
- the highest rate in the world. And a majority of these divorces - 
about 60% - are among couples with children.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For years while the divorce rate was skyrocketing, social scientists 
argued that children were largely unaffected by divorce.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many even argued that children were better off being raised by a 
single parent than they were watching parents quarrel or remain in a 
loveless marriage.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But evidence to the contrary has mounted over the past two decades. 
Now there is little doubt - based on overwhelming research results - 
that, on average, children of divorce are worse off than those who 
grow up in intact families.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Children of divorce are more likely to be truant, to do poorly in 
school and to get in trouble with the law than children who grow up 
with both parents.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The "California Children of Divorce Study," one of the most 
comprehensive of its kind to date, found that more than a third of 
children from divorced families experienced moderate or severe 
depression even five years after divorce.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Among adolescent women in the study, "almost all confronted issues of 
love, commitment, and marriage with anxiety, sometimes with very great 
concern about betrayal, abandonment, and not being loved," according 
to Judith Wallerstein, who analyzed the results of the study in her 
book Second Chances: Men, Women, and Children a Decade After Divorce.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many of these young women, she reports, resorted to short-term sexual 
relationships in response to their fears and anxieties.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Barring physical or severe mental abuse, it is nearly always better 
for children in a family if their parents stay together.  

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until relatively recently, parents understood this and considered it 
an obligation on their part to remain together - at least until their 
children were grown.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1960, 91% of children lived with two parents. No more. A whole 
ethos of self-fulfillment and personal happiness has replaced the 
ethic of self-sacrifice and concern for the best interests of one's 
children.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Too many divorcing parents put their own desires and needs ahead of 
their children's and then rationalize their actions by claiming their 
children will be better off if their parents are happy.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For once it would be refreshing if those who do selfish things would 
simply own up to their behavior.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Marriage is never an easy proposition. I have never known a successful 
marriage that did not, at some point, experience severe stress that 
could tear the marriage apart if the parties allowed it.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The difference between couples who remain married and those who 
divorce is not more love or fewer difficulties, but greater 
commitment.  

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Those who stay married often face identical problems with those who 
split up, but the former ride out the difficulties.

In many countries, divorce laws encourage couples in this process by 
placing lengthy waiting periods before a marriage can be dissolved 
unless special grounds exist, such as adultery or abuse.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most nations in western Europe, including most of the socially liberal 
countries in Scandinavia, require a minimum of a one-year wait before 
uncontested divorces are granted.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A number of states are considering stricter divorce legislation this 
year, including Iowa and Michigan.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After years of ignoring the devastating impact divorce has on 
children, it's time public policy took account of what's good for 
children, not just what's convenient for their parents.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Divorce still hitting a million kids every year Divorces affect fewer 
children now than in 1980, but far more than in 1970:  <p>

<h2>
Surprise: Punishment Actually Cuts Crime 
</h2>
<p><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">
Linda  Chavez 
</a>

<P>  
The murder rate is dropping dramatically in cities across the country, 
but analysts disagree why. In New York, the murder rate dropped by 32% 
last year; Washington, D.C., experienced a 10% decline for the second 
year in a row. The pattern is repeating itself in cities large and 
small, and murder isn't the only serious crime that's down. Of the 
Justice Department's index of serious crimes, only larceny theft was 
up slightly (3%) in the first six months of 1995. A new study by the 
National Center for Policy Analysis in Dallas suggests that putting 
more criminals behind bars at least partly explains why crime is 
finally going down - at least in Texas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Overall, crime in Texas is now at its lowest point since 1973, and the 
murder rate is lower than at any time since 1966. Crime is falling 
most in big cities:  down 35% in Dallas and 29% in Houston between 
1991 and 1994, and the decline is  even greater for murder and motor 
vehicle theft - crimes that are almost always  reported and therefore 
most statistically reliable.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The precipitous drop is no great mystery to Morgan O. Reynolds, author 
of the study and a Texas A&M professor of economics. "Punishment 
works. Incarceration works. It's that simple," he says. Reynolds 
points to a "prison-building binge"  that tripled the state's capacity 
over five years. Texas now has more prisoners  per capita than any 
state in the country. And while many liberals would rate this a 
dubious distinction, more prisoners means fewer criminals out 
terrorizing their fellow citizens. Reynolds estimates that the lower 
crime rate means 1,140  fewer Texans will be murdered this year than 
in 1991 and 450,000 fewer crimes committed against persons and 
property.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The major problem in the exploding violent crime rate in recent years 
has been the inability of law enforcement to ensure that convicted 
criminals remain behind bars for a significant length of time. Prison 
became a revolving door through which violent felons passed repeatedly 
in and out, with stays so short it sometimes seemed convicts were 
being given a respite from their life on the streets rather than 
punishment. Parole was used by many prison officials throughout the 
country as a means to reduce prison overcrowding, not because 
convicts' crimes or their behavior in prison justified early release.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Texas was no exception. In 1990, Texas prison officials approved 79% 
of all prisoners considered for parole, in large part because of a 
federal court order  to reduce crowding in state prisons (a fate 
shared by more than 40 other states). With a threefold increase in 
prison cells since then, however, Texas' parole approval rate fell to 
22% in 1994. And there is good reason to believe that longer prison 
terms reduce crime, not only by removing perpetrators temporarily from 
society but also by deterring others who are considering committing 
crimes.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As Reynolds notes, committing a crime is often a rational decision. 
Arrest rates are down in Texas, as in most other states, over the past 
three decades. The probability of being arrested for committing murder 
is down 21%, and down 22% for committing rape. With little chance of 
getting caught, criminals find the benefits of crime outweigh the 
costs, he says. Nonetheless, this calculus changes if the punishment 
increases dramatically - as it has in Texas. Expected prison time for 
convicted murderers is up 274% over the past three years, and up 152% 
for rape and 246% for aggravated assault.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps the most effective way to prevent crime is to make the 
punishment so  harsh and so certain that would-be criminals decide the 
risk isn't worth taking. Let the experts argue - Texas legislated 
those policies, and crime fell.

<P>
 
Ever wonder why so many Americans are turned off by politics, 
politicians, journalists and nearly everything having to do with 
Washington? (Except maybe its monuments and museums?)

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Maybe all the fuss generated by "Primary Colors" -- the new, 
anonymously written novel about the 1992 Clinton campaign -- provides 
a clue.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It's the ultimate insider's tale about a world that few on the outside 
know or care about, and it's preoccupying a good deal of the nation's 
capital. The novel itself and the controversy it has generated are 
testaments to all that is petty, insular and creepy about political 
Washington.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Using the techniques of a roman a clef (which means literally "novel 
with a key"), the story reads like a political edition of the game 
Trivial Pursuit.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The story involves a young, ambitious governor of a small Southern 
state whose presidential campaign is plagued by scandals.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If you don't know who Mandy Grunwald, Betsy Wright and Stanley 
Greenberg are (they're actual Clinton operatives), you'll probably get 
lost trying to decipher the book's elaborate cast of characters. Which 
seems to be the author's aim: Create cardboard-cutout characters 
immediately recognizable to Washington sophisticates but of little 
interest to the rest of the world, then hope the pundits create a 
large enough buzz to sell lots of books.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The plan seems to be working. "Primary Colors" hits No. 1 this week on 
USA TODAY's best-seller list.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All of this might be harmless enough were it not for two insidious 
aspects of the book.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was written either by someone inside the Clinton operation or a 
reporter with access to intimate details of the campaign, and it 
contains every vicious, undubstantiated rumor ever circulated about 
Bill or Hillary Clinton.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Washington officials, pundits and the press corps are too busy trying 
to guess who wrote the novel to waste much indignation on the ethics, 
much less propriety, of the venture. But surely there is something 
wrong when either a former campaign worker or a journalist can make 
money anonymously peddling smarmy gossip about the president of the 
United States and his wife.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Staff loyalty is a virtue that has long since disappeared in 
Washington. Presidential aides no longer wait until their boss is out 
of office (much less dead) to write intimate tell-alls -- and 
Republican presidents fare no better than Democrates. But "Primary 
Colors" breaks new ground in the kiss-and-tell genre. By remaining 
anonymous, the author keeps his or her reputation intact -- at least 
temporarily -- while ravaging others'.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most disturbing possibility is that the book was written not by 
someone inside the campaign but by a journalist. The novel reeks of a 
strange, hybrid bias -- it exudes both admiration and contempt for the 
Clintons.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whoever wrote the book is a fan of the Clintons' politics but clearly 
not of their moral character. Journalists are entitled to their biases 
and opinions -- so long as they're stated up front. That's why 
newspapers have editorial and opinion pages. But journalists are not 
free to weave their prejudices into their reporting.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor should they be free to slander public figures through thinly 
veiled fiction while keeping their own identities secret.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I'm no fan of the Clintons, but they deserve better than this.

<h2>
Self-Esteem's Dark Side Emerges 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">
Linda Chavez
</a>

<P>
As we squander money building students' egos, we feed crime. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
We've heard it so often, none of us questions whether it's actually 
true: you've got to feel good about yourself in order to succeed. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The crusade to improve self-esteem has invaded every sector of life -- 
public and private -- but nowhere more pervasively than education. 
School reformers have spent millions of dollars in the past two 
decades trying to raise the self-esteem of poor achievers. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But researchers now are questioning whether this money has been a good 
investment, since increases in self-esteem show little -- if any -- 
effect on actual achievement. And now a new study, published in the 
journal of the American Psychological Association, suggests raising 
self-esteem may actually be dangerous, especially among individuals 
whose inflated sense of self-worth does not comport with reality. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For at least a generation, it has been an axiom of U.S. education that 
children must have high self-esteem in order to perform well 
academically.<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And U.S. students today measure higher than those from any other 
country on questions of self-esteem. Unfortunately, they don't do 
nearly as well on math or science or reading, lagging g far behind 
much of the industrial world in actual performance in these areas. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For critics of the self-esteem movement, such evidence suggests 
American schools have wasted a lot of money and effort that could have 
been spent more productively on basic skills and more rigorous 
academic content. But the increased emphasis on self-esteem that has 
permeated American education may be even more pernicious than most 
critics assumed. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to three research psychologists who evaluated dozens of 
studies of violent behavior, high self-esteem is more often associated 
with violence than low self-esteem. The authors -- Roy F. Baumeister 
of Case Western Reserve University and Joseph M. Boden and Laura Smart 
of the University of Virginia -- acknowledge that their conclusions 
run counter to conventional wisdom that low self-esteem is the source 
of most anti-social behavior. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But their evidence for "the dark side of high self-esteem" is 
persuasive. The authors claim that "people turn aggressive when they 
receive feedback that contradicts their favorable views (of 
themselves). More to the point, it is mainly the people who refuse to 
lower their self-appraisals who become violent." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A teen who feels he hasn't received the respect he deserves -- in 
other words, he's been dissed -- is more likely to strike out than one 
who genuinely believes himself unworthy -- a sign of low self-esteem. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Baumeister and his co-authors cite dozens of studies of murder, rape, 
domestic abuse and even terrorism that show that violence occurs more 
often when a perpetrator with a high -- often inflated -- opinion of 
himself is challenged by someone he considers inferior. One study of 
more than 100 rapists, for example, confirms that rapists sometimes 
choose a particular victim in order "to disabuse her of her sense of 
superiority. That is, the woman gave the man the impression she 
thought she was better than he was and so he raped her as a way of 
proving her wrong." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps the most interesting example given of the correlation between 
high self-esteem and violent behavior involves racist violence. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nazism involved a whole ideology of racial superiority that justified 
violence against those deemed weak or inferior. Similarly, the Ku Klux 
Klan during its heyday was often most violent against two groups who 
challenged the notion of white supremacy: upwardly mobile blacks, and 
whites who helped blacks or treated them as equals. The authors note 
that one study of whites belonging to hate groups demonstrated that 
those who engaged in violent behavior actually were better educated 
and had higher career aspirations than non-violent members of such 
groups. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Baumeister and his colleagues suggest that efforts to raise self-
esteem actually may be making the problems of violence worse: "The 
societal pursuit of high self-esteem for everyone may literally end up 
doing considerable harm." Their conclusion should give all of us -- 
especially educators -- pause. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All those inflated teen-age egos may be contributing to an explosion 
in youth violence that has only begun.

<h2>
Castro Acts, Clinton Crumbles  
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">

</a>

<P>
President should call for full sanctions and threaten a military 
blockade and retaliatory strikes if necessary.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Clinton faces a touch test of his foreign policy as he 
fashions a response to the downing Saturday of two U.S. civilian 
aircraft in international waters near Cuba. And, so far, he's in 
danger of flunking.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When Haitian or Bosnian lives were at stake over the past three years, 
Clinton didn't hesitate to threaten and ultimately to use force, 
sending thousands of troops to defend dubious U.S. interests. But the 
brutal attack on unarmed Americans (three of four fliers were U.S. 
citizens) last weekend elicited no such reolve.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The best the president could muster in the hours after the attack was 
to send the Coast Guard to try to recover the bodies. And his 
announcement Monday that he would reinstate a ban on charter flights 
to Cuba doesn't go nearly far enough.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The administration's policy toward Cuba has been muddled from the 
beginning.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The president would clearly like to normalize relations with Cuba and 
has been steadily moving in that direction since he took office. But 
Fidel Castro keeps throwing monkey wrenches in the deal. The attack on 
two U.S. planes is only the most recent - and most surprising - of his 
actions.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Castro consistently has thumbed his nose at Clinton. In August 1994, 
Castro embarrassed the United States by allowing 30,000 Cubans to flee 
the island on rickety boats headed for the U.S. The president handled 
the crisis by detaining most of the refugees in camps outside the U.S. 
and repatriating those who would agree to return to Cuba. To do so, 
the president had to reverse the U.S. policy granting Cuban refugees 
automatic asylum that had been on the books for 30 years.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Last fall, in the hopes of improved relations with Cuba, the 
administration lifted some restrictions on air flights and on goods 
and dollars that could be sent to the island by Americans. And, for 
the time being, money from relatives will continue to flow.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most observers believed that the administration was moving toward 
lifting the 34-year-old U.S. embargo against Cuba and would - in a 
second term - grant formal recognition to Cuba, which the United 
States has withheld for more than 35 years.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But Castro has rewarded the Clinton administration's overtures with 
increased belligerence.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Castro continues to rule Cuba with an iron fist, tolerating no open 
dissent and inflicting terrible deprivation on his own citizens in 
order to maintain a powerful military, even as the economy of the 
island crumbles. In recent weeks, he has resorted to rounding up 
dissidents and human rights activists.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the past two weeks alone, Cuban state secret police have arrested, 
detained or searched the homes of 50 dissidents.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps the downing of the two U.S. civilian planes will finally 
convince the president that he's headed down the wrong path.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Castro understands only one thing: power. Castro will escalate his 
violence if he thinks he can literally get away with murder, including 
killing Americans.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The administration ought to use this incident to totally revise its 
Cuba policy.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sanctions against Cuba ought to be fully reinstated and vigorously 
enforced. The president should warn Cuba in no uncertain terms that 
any repeat of the refugee blackmail Castro initiated in 1994 and 1980 
(when more than 100,000 Cuban refugees fled by boat to the U.S.) will 
be met with a military blockade. And any further military attacks on 
Americans will be dealt with in kind by retaliatory strikes by U.S. 
forces.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The president shouldn't expect much support from the international 
community on such a  course of action. It took hours of debate to get 
even a mild U.N. Security Council statement deploring Cuba's attack on 
the two planes. But Cuba is in America's back yard and Fidel Castro 
remains a threat, not only to his own people but also to ours. The 
next time Clinton thinks about deploying U.S. troops, maybe he should 
consider defending U.S. interests a little closer to home.

<h2>
Welfare Reform: Bill, Shame On You 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">
Linda Chavez
</a>
<p>
<i>Political ad promoting president as great reformer is just a fraud. </i>
<P>
BETHESDA, Md. -- The biggest case of welfare fraud in U.S. history is 
taking place right now -- and the perpetrator is Bill Clinton.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Harsh words? Yes, but the president and the Democratic National 
Committee deserve it for the dishonest political commercials they're 
now airing trumpeting Bill Clinton as the Great Welfare Reformer.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The ads appear in 13 Midwestern and Western bellwether states where 
conservative Democrats traditionally determine presidential election 
outcomes. I saw them just last week in New Mexico, where they were 
showing several times a day.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Families destroyed. Children's dreams lost. The legacy of our present 
welfare system," intones the narrator over depressing pictures of 
poverty.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"The president's plan: Increase child support enforcement, reduce teen 
pregnancy. Work requirements for welfare recipients, strict time 
limits on welfare benefits. Teach values in our schools. No work, no 
welfare -- rescue children from the destructive welfare system," 
bellows the unseen narrator as the pictures change.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A worker punches a time clock, kids say the Pledge of Allegiance -- 
images of patriotism and bedrock family values flash across the 
screen.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The ad ends with Clinton's last State of the Union address: "We can 
make real welfare reform a reality in the lives of the American 
people," he tells Congress.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What the ad doesn't say is that Clinton has already vetoed two 
welfare-reform packages that would have accomplished everything the 
commercial claims the president wants.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In December, Congress passed both a comprehensive welfare bill and an 
even more ambitious welfare-reform package in the budget 
reconciliation bill. The first would have saved more than $ 58 billion 
over seven years, the second more than $ 81.5 billion during the same 
period. The president vetoed both, even though he offered no serious 
alternative himself.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Among the bills' provisions were tough work requirements. Adults on 
welfare would have to begin working within two years and would face a 
five-year lifetime limit on their welfare benefits.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the area of child-support enforcement, the bills created a central 
registry to track deadbeat parents nationwide and required states to 
suspend driver's licenses for those who failed to pay support.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To deter teen pregnancy, the bills allowed states to deny teen-agers 
welfare payments unless the young mothers agreed to supervised living 
arrangements.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bills also did some things not mentioned in the Clinton ads.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The legislation proposed cutting off aid to drug users and alcoholics 
who now qualify for disability payments under the Supplemental 
Security Income program.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bills also proposed limiting aid available to new immigrants, a 
provision that simply puts teeth in existing immigration law, which 
requires that sponsors of immigrants bear financial responsibility for 
their charges for the first five years they live in the U.S.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Americans want welfare reform, and Clinton knows it. In 1992, he 
managed to hoodwink a plurality of the electorate into thinking he 
would "end welfare as we know it." Clinton's use of the welfare issue 
was calculated to win back voters the Democratic Party has been losing 
to Republicans over the last two decades. The campaign successfully 
targeted key states with high percentages of "Reagan Democrats" and 
ran ads very similar to those the DNC is pushing this year.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But the moment he was inaugurated, President Clinton quickly put 
welfare reform on the back burner while he attended to more pressing 
issues like gays in the military.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It wasn't until 1994 that the president even bothered to send up a 
welfare-reform package.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For Clinton now to try to regain the mantle of welfare reformer shows 
more than the usual political chutzpah. He's trying to defraud the 
American people in an election year.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If the DNC's welfare-reform ad promoted a commercial product rather 
than the president of the United States, the Federal Trade Commission 
would yank it from the airwaves.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At the very least, the ad ought to bear the warning: Voters beware.

<title>Chavez: Culture Fails a Child -- And A Teacher

<h2> 
Culture Fails A Child -- and A Teacher 
</h2> 
 
 
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html"> 
Linda Chavez 
</a> 
 
<P>   

BETHESDA, Md. -- She was a 45-year-old special education teacher, a   
wife and the mother of a 6-year-old boy. He was a troubled teen-ager   
who desperately wanted a gold Toyota Camry for his 17th birthday.   
Their paths crossed at a shopping center in Toms River, N.J., where   
the teacher drove her 1995 gold Camry to buy a sandwich on her way to   
a college exam.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
That chance encounter ended both their lives. The teacher was buried   
last week. The boy sits in jail, awaiting trial for murder and   
carjacking. As tragic as this incident was, it wouldn't have attracted   
much attention were it not for one difference. The teacher, Kathleen   
Weinstein, surreptitiously recorded the last half-hour of her life,   
which she spent counseling, cajoling and pleading with the teen-ager.   
The recording led police to the boy, Michael LaSane.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Unlike the 35,000 attempted or completed carjackings that take place   
each year, this one became a national story when bits of the   
transcript were printed in newspapers across the nation.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Most of the attention has focused on Weinstein, a remarkable woman   
right down to her last minutes on Earth. But it's her alleged   
assailant -- and the thousands like him -- we must begin to focus on.   
What is it that motivates a teen-ager to kill an innocent stranger?   
What can we do to prevent such horrors? Sure, we need tougher laws,   
more policemen and more prisons. But we also need to admit that   
something has gone very wrong with our culture when so many young   
people have no regard for human life and do not seem even to   
understand the difference between right and wrong.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Weinstein's alleged assailant doesn't quite fit our image of a killer.   
Yes, like 70% of young men who commit violent crimes, he comes from a   
single-parent household, and he lives in public housing, where crime   
is all too common. But his mother works in law enforcement, and his   
family is described by friends as God-fearing churchgoers. And while   
Michael had been in trouble with the police before, nothing about his   
record indicates he was capable of such cold-blooded violence.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What is known about Michael is that he was obsessed with owning a   
shiny new car. He talked about it incessantly to his friends,   
describing how he was saving to buy his dream. It is a fantasy that   
consumes most teen-agers, reinforced dozens of times a day by TV ads   
that equate owning a new car with success, physical attractiveness and   
even intelligence.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And it's not just cars; it's all manner of material things we're told   
we can't live without. The young are especially susceptible to such   
messages, particularly since so many young people have nothing -- no   
one -- countering such influences in their lives. Increasing numbers   
of fathers are missing altogether from their children's lives, and   
mothers are spending less and less time caring for their children.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One-third of American children are now born to single mothers, and   
half of all children will spend part of their childhoods without   
fathers. About 70% of mothers of young children now work outside the   
home and often are so tired when they come home there's no energy left   
over to provide the consistent discipline and moral education children   
need.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Schools no longer teach right from wrong, either. For decades,   
intellectuals have claimed there are no absolutes - everything is   
relative, governed by the circumstances.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In one young man's case, the situation was clear. He had to have a   
gold Camry. He bragged he was getting it for his birthday. In her last   
few minutes, Mrs. Weinstein couldn't teach lessons the whole culture   
had failed to teach this boy in a lifetime.

<h2> 
Hollywood Misses American Reality 
</h2> 
 
 
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html"> 
Linda Chavez 
</a> 
 
<P>   
BETHESDA, Md. -- Sex sells. Hollywood is simply giving Americans what  
they want. That's the explanation entertainment executives and media 
critics have been giving for years to explain why sex saturates movies 
and TV. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But a new public opinion survey by U.S. News & World Report suggests 
they're wrong. Americans are fed up with the smutty fare the networks 
dish out. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
The magazine surveyed a random sample of 1,000 adults in March and 
reported the results in the April 15 issue. Overwhelmingly, 
respondents reported that they disapproved of what they see on TV. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
More than 80% expressed concern about verbal references to sex, 
nudity, and premarital and extramarital sex on TV. And 75% were 
worried about portrayals of homosexual activity. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
And huge majorities said they believe that television portrayals of 
sex or sexual references actually affect behavior: 84% said such 
portrayals contributed to extramarital sex, 83% to casual sex, 90% to 
young people having sex, and 94% to violence against women. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Are Americans overreacting? Or is TV really raunchier these days? 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
The magazine actually surveyed prime-time shows on the four major 
broadcast networks for one week. It found that half of all shows 
contained sexual acts or references to sex. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Another, more comprehensive study by media analysts Robert and Linda 
Lichter found a sex act or reference occurs once every four minutes on 
prime-time shows. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
And the sexual depictions are anything but responsible. Casual sex is 
the basic plot line of NBC's top-rated sitcom Friends, about a group 
of libidinous twentysomethings always on the make. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Recent episodes have depicted one-night stands, lesbian moms, 
homosexual marriage (with House Speaker Newt Gingrich's openly gay 
sister performing the ceremony) and intergenerational romance. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
The latter plot involving the show's ingenue Monica (Courtny Cox) and 
Richard (played by Tom Selleck -- who ironically has been active in 
the traditional values movement) made much of Richard's quaint lack of 
sexual experience. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
As a divorced man in his 40s, Richard admits he's slept with only two 
women, his wife and Monica. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
While that makes him practically a freak as a TV character, it 
probably puts him in the same category as about two-thirds of men his 
age. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
According to the most comprehensive study of Americans' sexual 
behavior ever done, the National Health and Social Life Survey 
conducted in the early '90s, 67% of men Richard's age actually married 
their first sexual partner, and more than 65% of males remain faithful 
to their spouses while they are married. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
But TV reflects neither reality nor viewers' preferences. What it does 
reflect is the values of its creators. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Although U.S. News didn't conduct a scientific survey of entertainment 
executives, it did mail out a questionnaire to more than 6,000 
Hollywood leaders, about 10% of whom responded. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
And the gap in attitudes between the TV executives and the public was 
huge. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
In virtually every category, only a minority of the Hollywood elite 
who responded showed concern about actual sexual activities on TV. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Less than one-third expressed concern about homosexual activity, 
compared with three-quarters of the public, for example, and half as 
many industry executives as the general public were upset by TV nudity 
or seminudity. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Since these executives took the time to respond to the survey in the 
first place, their responses may actually overstate general Hollywood 
concerns about sex on TV. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
After all, those who don't think there's a problem would be least 
likely to fill out the survey. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
So why not just turn off the TV set or change the channel? More and 
more Americans may be doing just that, which partially explains why 
the networks are losing audience share. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
But that's not the total answer. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Hollywood isn't a society unto itself, and the values it helps create 
shape the world in which all of us live. It's hard to imagine even 
Hollywood executives wanting their own children to behave as 
promiscuously as the characters they create in prime time.

HEADLINE: Minimum wage: Bad idea GOP fears to fight 
 
BETHESDA, Md. -- Republicans may as well run a white flag up the 
Capitol flagpole if the current debate over a minimum-wage hike is any 
indication of their resolve to retain congressional power this fall. 
The Republican leadership seems to have given up even trying to make 
the case against raising the minimum wage. The leaders know the 
Democrats' proposal to increase the federal minimum wage 20% over two 
years, to $ 5.15 per hour, is bad policy, but they're scared to death 
of the politics of the issue. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
That's why 24 moderate Republicans have already broken ranks with the 
leadership and offered their own -- higher -- minimum-wage bill. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But sacrificing policy to politics is usually a bad bargain, even in 
an election year. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
There's no question that raising the minimum wage is popular. Recent 
polls show that about 8 in 10 voters favor the proposed increase. Most 
people can't imagine living on the current $ 4.25 an hour minimum, 
much less supporting a family on such low wages. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And rightfully so, since so few workers actually do support themselves 
or families at minimum-wage jobs. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Of the approximately 2 million workers -- out of a national workforce 
of nearly 140 million -- who earn $ 4.25 or less an hour, 53% are 
younger than 25 years of age. Most minimum-wage workers today are 
secondary earners who come from middle-class families, often students 
who work part time. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Almost as many current minimum-wage workers live in families earning 
more than $ 50,000 a year as live in poor households. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Of course, increasing the minimum by 90 cents an hour will enlarge the 
universe of minimum-wage workers, covering an additional 8 million 
workers who earn up to $ 5.15 an hour, many of whom are older and more 
likely to support families. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
But it won't necessarily improve their economic opportunities. Most 
economists agree that raising the minimum wage will cost jobs; the 
only real question is how many. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has been touting a couple of studies 
that dispute decades of research in this area, most notably a study 
involving fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and California by 
Princeton economists David Card and Alan Krueger (who served for a 
while as Reich's chief economist). The Card/Krueger study purported to 
show that New Jersey's state minimum-wage hike to $ 5.05 per hour, one 
of the highest in the nation, did not lead to job losses. But the 
study now has been largely discounted by everyone but its authors and 
Reich. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The New Jersey findings were based on data obtained from carelessly 
worded telephone surveys and were subsequently disproved by other 
economists who examined actual payroll records in the state. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Nonetheless, most Republicans have been intimidated into silence. The 
best the leadership now hopes for is to attach the proposal to 
legislation Republicans want and Democrats don't, thereby either 
sinking the bill or exacting a price for its passage. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Perhaps the most cynical political move of all, however, came from the 
24 maverick House Republicans who last week announced their own bill 
to increase the federal minimum wage to $ 5.25 an hour. Most of them 
come from high-wage states in the Northeast with tight labor markets 
where it is almost impossible to hire someone at the minimum wage. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
These states have been losing jobs to lower-wage states in the South 
and West for years. 
 But if Congress increases the minimum wage nationally, these states 
won't be at such a competitive disadvantage. What these Republican 
legislators seem to be saying (if not in so many words) is that if 
their districts must lose jobs, why not share the pain? 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Republicans have nothing to gain by backing a minimum-wage increase -- 
and a lot to lose. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
If the Republicans cave on this issue, it will cost jobs -- including, 
no doubt, those of some Republican members of Congress who will have shown they lack the courage of their own convictions. 
<BR>

<title>Chavez: All Hail Shift From Racial Numbers Game  - 5/01/96

<h2>  
All Hail Shift From Racial Numbers Game  
</h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">  
Linda Chavez  
</a>  
  
<P>    
 
BETHESDA, Md. -- Proponents of affirmative action and forced busing  
are complaining of an ominous shift away from support for civil  
rights. They point to recent court rulings and state and national  
efforts to bar preferences for minorities as proof the mood has turned  
ugly. A recent cover of Time even warned the country is headed "Back  
to segregation" on the eve of the 100th anniversary of Plessy vs.  
Ferguson, the Supreme Court's infamous 1896 "separate but equal"  
ruling.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
What's really going on is the repudiation of the racial numbers game  
invoked to end discrimination. Americans overwhelmingly support the  
right of minorities to attend the same schools and compete for the  
same jobs as whites. The National Opinion Research Center, which has  
been monitoring opinion on racial issues for more than 50 years,  
reports that 90% of Americans favor such rights.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
That doesn't mean they're willing to go along with schemes to bus  
schoolchildren or give hiring preferences to minorities to maintain  
some ideal "racial balance." Debates in Massachusetts and California  
illustrate the current mood.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
For years, Massachusetts has been trying to enforce racial balance in  
the public schools. A 22-year-old state law declares any school with a  
minority enrollment that exceeds 50% is out of balance. Under the law,  
districts that "voluntarily" balance their schools' racial composition  
through busing or other methods receive a huge financial bonus. The  
state covers 90% of the cost of school construction for districts that  
comply, an incentive critics have called a virtual bribe.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Now, however, the state board of education is considering repealing  
the law. And the most vociferous proponent of repeal is Abigail  
Thernstrom, a soft-spoken political scientist with impeccable civil  
rights credentials.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
California, too, has been in the forefront of the racial numbers game,  
especially in higher education. A University of California medical  
school was the focus of the Supreme Court's famous 1978 Bakke  
decision, which barred outright admissions quotas by race but allowed  
schools to "take race into account" in order to promote "diversity."  
Last summer, however, the university's regents voted to prohibit any  
racial or ethnic preferences in admissions or hiring. And leading the  
charge was Ward Connerly, a black businessman who now heads the effort  
to enact a ban on all state preferences.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Neither move indicates the clock is being turned back on civil rights  
enforcement. What they do signify is an end to a fixation with racial  
balance as an end in itself. That obsession did little to improve the  
quality of education for black or white children or to improve the  
skills of minority workers.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
In his book Forced Justice, David Armor points out that the gap  
between white and black educational achievement has been closing over  
the past few decades, but it has little to do with school  
desegregation. According to Armor's assessment of national data,  
"Gains for segregated black students are as large or larger than for  
desegregated blacks, and . . . blacks in disadvantaged urban  
communities gain as much as blacks in nondisadvantaged communities."  
Armor maintains that black students' achievement has much more to do  
with their parents' economic status than their classmates' color, just  
like whites.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Simply trying to balance numbers by race and ethnicity won't improve  
the quality of schools children attend or help them gain the skills  
necessary to compete later in life. But a shift away from numbers  
might actually force policymakers to deal with the true impediments to  
minority progress.  
<BR>

Linda Chavez     
</a>     
     
<P>       
 If Americans want big, fancy cars, they have to pay the price.     
 <p> 
BETHESDA, Md. -- Looking for someone to blame for today's high gas     
prices? Chances are the culprits aren't some oil executives in Houston     
or sheiks in Riyadh, but a lot closer to home.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
Try looking in your own garage or your neighbor's. Minivans, sport     
utility vehicles and pickup trucks are fast replacing compacts as     
Americans' favorite vehicles. These bigger cars, plus higher speed     
limits, have driven down fuel efficiency and driven up demand.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
So, too, did last winter's bitter cold, which kept consumers burning     
more heating oil in their furnaces. Just last week, snow once again     
hit the Rocky Mountains and the Midwest, creating more home heating     
oil demand long past the usual season. And unless supply can keep pace     
with demand -- which is difficult in the short run for a product like     
gasoline -- the price goes up. It's as close to a fixed law of     
economics as there is.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
But politicians can't very well blame their own constituents or Mother     
Nature for rising prices at the pumps, so they're playing politics --     
on both sides of the aisle. The Clinton administration announced plans     
to sell off part of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This move is     
probably harmless, if ineffectual, since it will add a mere trickle     
into the consumers' supply, about 12 million barrels or less than two     
days' worth of gas for the nation's drivers.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
But the administration didn't stop there. The Justice Department also     
announced it will investigate the oil companies for collusion and     
price-fixing. This is nothing more than a cynical attempt to win votes     
by peddling paranoia.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
Meanwhile, the Republicans have been exploiting the gasoline pricing     
issue for their own purposes. They're using recent price hikes to     
justify repealing a tax they've been opposed to from its inception:     
the Clinton administration's 4.3-cent-per-gallon gas tax. Cutting     
taxes is a good thing, but no one should be under any illusion that     
repealing the gas tax will have any permanent effect on the price of     
gasoline.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
One of the biggest dangers in this political posturing is that it     
feeds the all-too-common misconception that government intervention in     
the economy can work to benefit consumers. It never happens that way.     
Even if the president or Congress could wave a magic wand and cut     
prices, government price controls lead to supply shortages. Would     
Americans really rather line up for hours at filling stations than pay     
a few cents more per gallon?     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
In fact, although prices have risen steeply recently -- 13% in three     
months -- gasoline is still a great bargain in the United States.     
Europeans and Asians pay four times as much for their gas as we do,     
which is why they drive smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. And the     
American Petroleum Institute says we are actually paying the lowest     
price per gallon, in constant dollars, since World War I.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
But although we're paying less, we're using more gasoline than ever.     
We now live farther from work and shopping than we once did. And wives     
as well as husbands commute to work, often in separate cars from their     
spouses. All that adds up to more miles on the road.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
Dr. Lee Shipper, a researcher at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in     
California, estimated in The New York Times recently that U.S.     
vehicles traveled 7,900 miles per person in 1994, compared with 5,350     
in 1973. More fuel-efficient cars in recent years helped reduce the     
impact of these longer distances. But in 1994, bigger vehicles brought     
fuel efficiency down once again to 19.3 miles per gallon from a high     
of 20.2 in 1985.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
Prices will probably decline somewhat in the weeks and months ahead as     
supply catches up with demand -- especially if Iraq re-enters the     
market, as it is expected to if Saddam Hussein agrees to terms imposed     
by the U=2EN. with U.S. backing.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
But so long as Americans want the freedom to drive our own big, fancy     
vehicles long distances for work and play, we're going to have to pay     
the price.     
<BR>

BETHESDA, Md. -- Has America embraced a "culture of death" as Pope   
John Paul II warned on a visit here in 1993?   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
A recent USA TODAY/CNN/GALLUP poll showing some 75% of Americans   
support so-called assisted suicide suggests the pope may be right.   
Most Americans who support "the right to die" -- including the   
ghoulish Dr. Jack Kevorkian, acquitted Tuesday of two counts of   
assisted suicide, and the judges in two recent appeals court cases in   
Washington and New York -- claim to be motivated by compassion. After   
all, they are only supporting people who want to end their own lives.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
But before the courts and the public get too enamored of this   
incipient movement, perhaps they ought to take a close look at what's   
happened in the Netherlands, the only Western nation that formally   
endorses the idea of physicians helping patients kill themselves.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
The Dutch have nearly a quarter century of experience with physician-  
assisted suicide and euthanasia. In 1990 a Dutch government commission   
conducted a survey, which showed that euthanasia is far more widely   
practiced in the Netherlands than officials had believed and that it   
is most frequently administered without patients' consent.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
According to the report of the Dutch commission, 11,800 patients were   
euthanized in 1990 through active measures, most often by   
administering lethal drugs, and 5,941 of these were performed without   
the patient's consent. Only 400 patients opted for assisted suicide.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
The commission also reported an additional 13,506 patients were denied   
"nonfutile medical treatment with intention to terminate life," a   
practice the Dutch call "euthanasia by omission" because it denies   
lifesaving treatment. And the great majority of these cases, 64%,   
involved persons who had given no prior consent to such a fate through   
a living will or other document.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
The Netherlands is a tiny country, with a population of only about 15   
million. To put these euthanasia figures in some perspective, a   
comparable euthanasia rate in the United States would result in nearly   
200,000 deaths from active measures and another 225,000 from   
euthanasia by omission.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
Once embarked down the path of doctor-assisted suicide, that may be   
where we are headed.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
The Dutch didn't start out to practice euthanasia so widely, but once   
doctors started killing patients rather than treating them, the slide   
into mass murder was relatively easy. A recent article by a Dutch   
physician, Richard Fenigsen, in the journal Issues in Law and Medicine   
explains why "Euthanasia is not just changing medicine; it is   
replacing medicine. This suppression of traditional medical thinking,   
medical working habits, and the medical way of reacting to events has   
an impact on both the emergency care and the long-term care of   
patients," he writes.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
Fenigsen describes several case studies. In one teaching hospital,   
anesthetists stopped providing anesthesia for cardiac surgery   
involving Down's syndrome patients. In other cases, hospitals and   
doctors refused to apply simple, lifesaving measures to patients whose   
lives they determined were "unlivable."   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
In one case, a physician did not administer insulin to a 6-year-old,   
mildly retarded boy who developed juvenile diabetes, thereby causing   
his death. In another, a doctor persuaded an elderly woman to stop   
taking medicine needed to treat an enlarged heart because she was   
living a "limited life" -- she depended on several medications, needed   
help cleaning her house, and could walk only a few blocks at a time.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
In all, 65% of Dutch doctors believe that physicians may propose   
active euthanasia to patients who do not ask for it themselves,   
according to Dutch surveys.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
"Euthanasia has perceptibly affected the position of the individual in   
relation to society, society's very nature and purpose, the law, the   
government, the judicial system, the family, the expectations of older   
persons and the prospects of newborn infants, the practice of   
medicine, and the care of persons with disabilities," Fenigsen writes.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
What has happened in the Netherlands could easily happen here if we   
allow it.

<h2> 
Clinton Welfare Flip: At Least He Landed in Right Spot
</h2>

Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>
BETHESDA, Md. -- He may not look like an Olympic gymnast, but Bill 
Clinton has proved he's a real master of the triple somersault with 
his latest move on welfare reform. The man who campaigned on the 
promise of ending welfare as we know it -- and then vetoed two 
welfare-reform bills which did just that -- has once again reversed 
himself.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On Saturday, the president announced he'll support a Wisconsin plan to 
abolish Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and replace it 
with a mandatory work program.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet just months ago, the president and other administration officials 
excoriated Republicans in Congress as "radical" and "extremist" for 
proposing welfare reforms far more modest than Wisconsin's plan.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson's welfare reform, Wisconsin will 
eliminate traditional welfare and replace it with work. Women who 
apply for assistance in Wisconsin will receive job counseling and be 
expected to work in a regular job or in one subsidized by the state.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For those who have few skills or little work experience, the state 
will provide community-service jobs or places in "sheltered workshops" 
which will provide work activities consistent with recipients' 
abilities.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These changes in state law require the administration's approval 
before they can take effect, however, which is why the president's 
endorsement is so crucial. And requiring welfare mothers to work is 
still controversial in some circles -- especially among Democrats.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Welfare-rights activists who oppose the Wisconsin reforms argue that 
children will suffer if their mothers are forced off welfare and into 
jobs unless the state provides a myriad of expensive services, 
including job training and child care.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And President Clinton cited the lack of sufficient money for training 
and child care in the congressional welfare-reform proposals when he 
vetoed them last winter.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But working mothers who have never been on welfare receive little, if 
any, help with subsidized day care for their children, much less 
government-financed employment training.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Does it really make sense to provide greater benefits to those who 
have shown less initiative and responsibility than we do to women who 
struggle to balance work and family duties?
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But some welfare advocates argue that mothers of young children 
shouldn't be forced to work at all. This argument might actually have 
carried some weight when most women stayed home to raise their 
children. Indeed, AFDC began in 1935 as a program to help women whose 
husbands had died or abandoned them, at a time when only about 8% of 
married women with children were in the labor force.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Today, however, 76% of married women with school-age children work, as 
do 62% of those with children under 6 years.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The great irony is that a larger percentage of married than single 
moms work. Only 57% of single mothers are in the workforce, including 
only 52% of those with children under 6. For nonworking single moms, 
Uncle Sam is the main provider. And women who bear children out of 
wedlock are far more likely than divorced mothers to end up on welfare 
and to stay there for long periods, sometimes indefinitely.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Clearly, something has gone wrong with a system that makes it easier 
for a woman to stay home to raise her children if she doesn't marry 
the father than if she does.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At least in Wisconsin that may no longer be the case.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It takes an election to get Bill Clinton to do the right thing. But 
for now, his latest welfare back flips have landed him in the right 
spot -- and he's likely to remain there at least for the rest of the 
campaign.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The trick for Republicans will be to use Clinton's Wisconsin decision 
to force his hand on a federal bill that puts in place some of the 
same reforms before the election.

<p>
BETHESDA, Md. -- Remember when there were two political parties in the 
U.S.? One party favored big government, the other wanted to cut it. 
One party talked about social justice, the other party demanded law 
and order. One party defended the right to do your own thing, the 
other encouraged traditional values. No more. At least when it comes 
to political rhetoric, the era of liberalism is over.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's no accident that today's Democrats -- most notably Bill Clinton -
- sound a lot like staunch Republicans. The country has shifted to the 
right over the last four presidential elections and Democrats have had 
to move, too, at least rhetorically.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A recent Gallup poll shows Americans overwhelmingly support a 
conservative political agenda. Over 80% favor a balanced budget 
amendment, oppose racial preferences in schools and jobs, and endorse 
English as the official language. More than 70% support congressional 
term limits, sanction a constitutional amendment allowing school 
prayer and want to cut off welfare after two years unless recipients 
work. Similarly large majorities oppose legalizing homosexual 
marriages, favor school choice and want to ban partial-birth 
abortions.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Given these numbers, no candidate in his or her right mind would 
publicly endorse deficit spending, racial quotas, or expanding 
welfare. When it comes to driving the political agenda Republicans win 
hands down -- which is why President Clinton is spending his time 
honing a conservative image.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The same man who pushed gays in the military now says he'll happily 
sign federal legislation to ban gay marriages.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The president who ignored welfare reform for his first two years in 
office, and then twice vetoed Republican welfare bills, now brags he's 
helped states to reform welfare on their own.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The president who appointed dozens of federal judges with a history of 
allowing criminals back on the streets never misses a photo 
opportunity to surround himself with police officers who put those 
criminals behind bars in the first place.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Clinton, ersatz conservative, hopes voters will forget his deeds and 
remember only his rhetoric. So far, the polls indicate his plan is 
working=2E Bill Clinton has never been so popular.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Will this strategy carry him through the election? And will Clinton's 
latest tilt to the right convince Americans the Democratic Party 
represents the new conservatism? Not likely.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most voters haven't even begun to concentrate on the election in the 
fall. They're too busy planning their kids' graduations and family 
vacations to focus on November.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When voters do start to focus in earnest -- probably not until the 
party conventions -- Democrats will have a hard time sustaining their 
new-found conservatism. Public employees, who make up the biggest 
block of delegates, will hardly turn the Democrat convention into a 
cut-government-spending rally.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Education Association won't countenance discussion of 
school choice. And Jesse Jackson would never permit his party to roll 
back racial preferences.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Forget Democratic support for making English the official language. As 
for endorsing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, how 
would that make the 162 congressional Democrats who voted against it 
look?
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The fact is, Democrats can't make good on Republican issues even when 
it's in their interest to do so. When it comes to acting, not talking, 
1996 won't be any different. Come November voters will choose 
Republican action over Democratic words.

<h2>The Coming Battle on Social Security</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P>
The continuing conflict over Medicare reform may be just a warm-up to 
the coming battle on Social Security.  Though few politicians want to 
talk about it, the Social Security system is anything but secure.  And 
if current demographic trends continue, those persons who are 25-50 
years-old today can forget about recouping their contributions into 
the system when they turn 65.
<P>
Social Security is one of the biggest give-away programs in the 
federal budget, yet the program remains almost universally popular and 
untouchable when it comes to budget-cutting.  Why?  Because most 
people -- both the elderly and younger workers -- have been sold a 
bill of goods.
<P>
Myth # 1. Social Security recipients are simply getting back in 
benefits what they and their employers put into the system in payroll 
taxes during their working lives.  
<p>
Actually, the average person retiring today will get back what he and 
his employers paid into the system within the first 4.5 years after 
retirement.  Since the average man will live 7.3  years after 
retirement age and the average woman 14 years, most beneficiaries will 
receive nearly 1.5 to 3 times what they contributed.
<p>
Myth # 2.  The Social Security Trust Fund operates like any other 
pension system, the money is put aside and invested to pay for future 
benefits.
<p>
Wrong.  In most private pension plans, the employer/employee 
contributions are saved and invested to provide  the actual benefits 
workers will receive from the plan.  But Social Security benefits are 
financed differently, on a pay-as-you-go system.  Benefits don't come 
from retirees' own contributions, but rather from the contributions of 
those who are still working.  
<p>
The so-called Trust Fund isn't really a separate fund at all, but a 
bookkeeping device.  And the money supposedly "in" the fund isn't 
invested but used by the government to pay for other government 
programs.  The fund supposedly "receives" long-term Treasury bonds in 
return for this "investment."  
<p>
In essence, the government borrows from itself and promises to pay it 
back at some later time.  But what that really means is that the 
government borrows from taxpayers, in this case future taxpayers, and 
most likely will pay it back by raising taxes down the line.
<p>
Myth # 3 Even if Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system, the next 
generation will be willing to pay for the program that, after all, 
takes care of its own parents.
<p>
The problem is the next generation of retirees had fewer children than 
previous generations.  The current system depends on a pyramid 
financing scheme.  In order to pay for the present level of benefits, 
3 workers contribute payroll taxes to pay for 1 retiree's benefits.  
But the ratio of workers to retirees is actually shrinking slightly.  
When the baby-boomers retire, there will be only 2 workers per retiree 
available to pay taxes for the same benefits.  Something will have to 
give: either benefits will significantly drop or taxes will rise 
dramatically.
<p>
Myth # 4.  The elderly are the most vulnerable and poorest members of 
society who can least afford to have their government benefits 
trimmed.
<p>
Certainly there are many poor elderly people in the U.S.  But the 
economic condition of the elderly has actually improved dramatically 
over the last few decades, while that of children has declined at the 
same time.  There has been a large shift in wealth in recent years 
from the young and working aged to the elderly, and government 
programs have been chiefly responsible.  
<p>
Although those aged 65 or older are only 12.5% of the population, they 
receive more than one-third of all federal dollars in benefits, 
regardless of actual need.  Americans rail against welfare programs 
for poor women and their children -- especially Aid to Families with 
Dependent Children, which accounts for only about 1% of federal 
spending -- but never imagine that both Social Security and Medicare 
are really welfare programs for the elderly, including those who are 
wealthy and have no need of subsidies.
<p>
It's time Americans of all ages face up to the fact that current 
elderly programs will bankrupt America. Radically reforming Social 
Security is not only necessary, but just and fair.

<h2>As In Israel, We Need to Tone Down Rhetoric</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 


The murder of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by an extreme 
Israeli nationalist should be a warning to all political groups that 
words have consequences. Since the signing of the first peace accord 
with the Palestinians in 1993, some opponents of the agreement have 
attacked Rabin in the most vicious and personal terms. Rabin was 
depicted as a traitor to his country, a murderer, even a Nazi SS 
officer.
<p>
Vilifying political opponents isn't unique to Israeli politics, nor 
are the dangers that go with such angry rhetoric. In recent months 
Democrats in Congress have called Republicans "worse than Hitler" and 
accused them of "practicing genocide with a smile." Meanwhile, 
Republicans have called Democrats "the enemy  of normal Americans," 
and the right-leaning National Rifle Association has portrayed federal 
law enforcement agents as jack-booted storm troopers.
<p>
The First Amendment gives us the right to call each other Nazis or 
enemies, but constitutional protection doesn't make it right. 
Responsible leaders have an obligation to refrain from engaging in 
such tactics and to discourage the behavior among their supporters. 
That doesn't mean we have to stifle political debate. The danger on 
any issue comes when the focus of criticism shifts from disparaging 
the policy to demonizing the policymakers. That dangerous game can 
have deadly consequences.
<p>
There seems to be a growing tendency to portray our political 
opponents not only as wrong but evil. When Democrats attack 
Republicans, they portray them as  callous and greedy, wanting to take 
food from the mouths of poor children to give money to the rich. 
Republicans engage in similar demonization, calling Democrats un-
American and immoral.
<p>
Politicians poison public debate when they turn policy differences 
into attacks on their opponents' character, ethics, patriotism and 
morality. What's more, they make legitimate compromise more difficult 
-- and public cynicism inevitable.
<p>
What will happen when the Democrats and Republicans agree on a budget 
-- as they must eventually? What will happen when the Congress reverts 
to Democratic control -- or a Republican occupies the White House? 
Will any of these events portend national disaster? Do they justify a 
revolution?
<p>
One of the saving graces of American politics has been its centrist 
nature. The ideological difference between Republicans and Democrats 
has never been as great as between the Conservative and Labor parties 
in England, not to mention as wide as the chasm that separates neo-
fascist and pro-communist groups in other European democracies.
<p>
Following Rabin's assassination, Benjamin Netanyahu, the leader of the 
opposition Likud Party in Israel and a critic of Rabin's peace plan, 
said the most important thing Israelis could do was to pull together 
as a nation and a people.
<p>
Americans face no crisis comparable to the Israelis' at the moment, 
but Netanyahu's advice could serve us well nonetheless. We've had our 
share of extremist individuals - on both the right and the left - who 
have engaged not only in assassinations but domestic terrorism.
<p>
Politicians in Israel, especially on the right, will be soul-searching 
to determine whether their words might have incited extremists in 
their midst to violence. We could do with some similar examination of 
conscience here at home.

<html><head><title>Chavez: Immigrants Make Gains in California
</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>

<h2>Immigrants Make Gains in California</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 
 
 
Californians still have earthquakes, mudslides and fires to worry 
about, but they can breathe a little easier when it comes to another 
perennial source of anxiety: the state's 6 million immigrants.
<p>
A new study by the University of Southern California shows that the 
region's immigrants are rapidly moving into the social and economic 
mainstream despite fears they would be a huge burden.
<p>
The study, by USC's School of Urban and Regional Planning, details 
impressive gains in income, status and English proficiency among the 
largest immigrant groups, including Asians and Latinos who arrived in 
the 1970s.
<p>
Using census data from 1980 and 1990, the USC researchers found that 
Asian immigrants in Southern California who were between 25 to 34 
years old in 1980 had more than doubled their average income by 1990.
<p>
Nearly 70 percent became U.S. citizens in the same period. And more 
than half spoke English very well.
<p>
Immigrants of the same age from Europe and the Middle East made 
similar gains in income and even more spectacular gains in English 
proficiency, though only 51 percent became citizens.
<p>
Even Latino immigrants had made significant progress, improving their 
earnings by 27 percent.
<p>
Although relatively few Latinos who came to the U.S. as adults spoke 
English  very well (only 21 percent of those who were 25 to 34 in 
1980), 70 percent of those who immigrated as children were fully 
proficient in English by 1990.
<p>
But if California immigrants are doing so well, why have their fellow 
state residents turned sour on immigration?
<p>
 Nearly half of registered voters in the state - including 28 percent 
of Hispanic voters - believe there is no benefit whatsoever from 
immigration, according to a recent Los Angeles Times poll.
<p>
And Californians aren't alone in their hostility to immigrants. Nearly 
two out of three Americans say immigrants are "a bad thing for this 
country" and will never assimilate.
<p>
The problem may have to do with more than simple prejudice.
<p>
With so many new immigrants coming to the United States now - about 
800,000 were admitted last year - it's difficult to measure their 
progress.
<p>
Simply comparing how all immigrants measure up on education, language, 
earnings and the like from 1980 to 1990 tells almost nothing about 
those immigrants who actually lived in the U.S. for that entire 10-
year period.
<p>
Why? Because the group measured in 1990 isn't composed of the same 
people as  the one measured in 1980.
<p>
The newer immigrants - by definition - haven't lived in the U.S. as 
long and  won't have had as much time to improve their status.
<p>
The USC researchers got around this problem by analyzing census data 
differently.
<p>
Instead of looking at all immigrants in 1980 and 1990, they broke up 
immigrants into groups based on their ethnic background, age and time 
of arrival.
<p>
The USC researchers then tracked these "cohorts" in the census of both 
1980 and 1990.
<p>
This allowed researchers to compare the same group 10 years apart.
<p>
The more accurate analysis can demonstrate what improvements similar 
groups of immigrants make in learning English, becoming citizens and 
increasing their incomes.
<p>
Too bad the USC study won't be widely read by those in or out of 
California.  It could be an important antidote to the anti-immigrant 
sentiment sweeping the country.
<p>
The USC data dispel many of the myths about immigrants: that they're 
stuck on the bottom rung of the economic ladder, that they can't or 
won't assimilate and that they'll never become Americans.
<p>
At the very least, the study should be required reading for members of 
Congress, who will soon vote on major legislation that could 
dramatically reduce immigration.

<hr>
<h2>The "Stern-ing" of America?</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 

What does it say about the state of our popular culture that radio 
shock-jock Howard Stern can replace Colin Powell as the best-selling 
author in America?
<p>
Stern's book, Miss America, went to the top of the charts last week, 
selling more than nine copies for every one copy of the next best-
selling book on the list.
<p>
Stern's specialty is trash talk, and apparently there are thousands of 
garbage collectors out there who will pay $ 27.50 to wallow in the 
muck.
<p>
I ran into several hundred of them last week in Manhattan as they 
lined up in front of a bookstore to get autographed copies of Stern's 
rubbish. I must admit I was intrigued, even a little amused (Howard 
Stern fans can read?) - from a distance.
<p>
The taxi driver warned me when I gave him the address of my 
appointment that it was just down the street from Stern's book signing 
and traffic would be more than usually snarled. He suggested dropping 
me short of my destination since I'd have better luck walking the last 
block and a half.
<p>
The sight of police barricades on the sidewalk and a dozen or more 
blue uniforms persuaded me he was right. Besides, I was curious to see 
just who would stand in line for several hours in 30-degree weather to 
get Stern's autograph. The mostly male, youngish crowd - late teens to 
mid-30s - weren't content to wait quietly for their chance to meet 
their idol, who had promised to appear dressed in the same 
transvestite outfit that adorns the book's cover. Several shouted 
insults and obscenities at cars, pedestrians, police, anyone and 
anything in hearing distance. I suppose I shouldn't have been 
surprised, but the voices bellowing curses felt like a slap in the 
face. I can turn the dial when I hear Stern's foul mouth on the public 
airwaves. But for the few minutes I stood waiting to cross the street 
in front of Stern's fans I couldn't escape his cheap imitators.
<p>
Stern likes to fashion himself a libertarian (he ran, briefly, as the 
Libertarian Party candidate for governor of New York in 1994) pushing 
the envelope of free speech on the radio. He even manages to sneak in 
a few lines of "social commentary" in his 482-page book, striking a 
blow for morality by inveighing against Woody Allen's "low-life, 
amoral habits" and the hypocrisy of those parents who sent their 
prepubescent sons to spend the weekend with Michael Jackson, no 
questions asked.
<p>
And Stern proudly touts his 20-year marriage, describing himself as "a 
devoted husband and father." It's enough to make you wonder if his 
whole bit isn't a put-on.
<p>
But Stern is no satirist, a latter-day Jonathan Swift making "a modest 
proposal." He incites nastiness, crudity and effrontery. And his fans 
revel in outdoing their mentor. In his book, Stern describes one 
particularly vulgar protege who specializes in Stern's trademark prank 
phone calls. This social misfit delights in tormenting TV call-in show 
hosts, especially Mother Angelica, a Roman Catholic nun whose program 
appears on a religious cable station. Stern reproduces the transcript 
of two of these creepy calls in his book under the subheading "Jesus 
died for you," in bold print.
<p>
Stern has made millions with this trash. And the sales of his book 
suggest he'll make millions more. And it's not just Stern who's 
getting rich, but also the publishers and radio stations that give him 
access to his audience.
<p>
Infinity Broadcasting, which produces his radio show, has paid $ 1.7 
million in fines to the Federal Communications Commission for some of 
Stern's on-air antics, which violated FCC rules. They're not laying 
out that kind of money just because they believe in the First 
Amendment. The response to Stern needn't be censorship. Mother 
Angelica had the best answer. "You really need to examine your 
conscience," Stern quotes her saying to a Stern-inspired prank caller.
<p>
There's not much hope Stern or his fans will take Mother Angelica's 
advice. But maybe the rest of us can shame the media executives who 
give Stern a platform into examining theirs.
<p>

<h2>Murders Show Evil Can Exist Anywhere</h2> 
<P>by <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 
 
  
Just last week in Illinois, Jacqueline Williams was accused of ripping 
an unborn baby from his murdered mother's womb.
<p>
Barely had the gruesome details faded from the headlines when two more 
ghastly stories appeared in which women were suspects in the horrific 
murders of their own children.
<p>
In Olathe, Kan., a 44-year-old doctor, Debora Green, was charged with 
setting fire to her own home and killing two of her three children. 
Green also is suspected of attempting to poison her estranged husband 
earlier this year, although charges have yet to be filed.
<p>
In New York, a 29-year-old woman, Awilda Lopez, was arrested for 
killing her  6-year-old daughter by hitting her in the head with a 
blunt object. Police who investigated the crime said the child bore 
numerous scars from cigarette burns and bruises over her whole body.
<p>
Who are these monster-women?
<p>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich blamed the Illinois murders, which 
included not only the dead mother but also two of her other children, 
on the welfare state.
<p>
Welfare policy has created "a drug-addicted underclass with no sense 
of humanity, no sense of civilization and no sense of the rules of 
life," Gingrich  told a Republican governors meeting shortly after the 
bizarre murders and kidnapping were reported.
<p>
If only it were as simple as that.
<p>
Yes, welfare policy has led to growing social pathology in this 
society. Welfare rewards people for not working, frees men from the 
financial responsibility for their children and encourages women to 
remain unwed if they become pregnant.
<p>
And certainly both the Illinois and New York murders took place in an 
underclass environment.
<p>
Although not all the details are yet known in the Williams case, drugs 
probably played some role. And Awilda Lopez, who was indicted Tuesday, 
was clearly involved in drugs: Her daughter was born addicted to crack 
cocaine.
<p>
Women who commit crimes are even more likely than men to be regular 
drug users: 65% of female prison inmates compared with 62% of males 
are regular drug  users, and 36% of women vs. 31% of men were using 
drugs when they committed the  crimes for which they are incarcerated.
<p>
But the problems go far deeper than drugs, welfare and the underclass.
<p>
Dr. Green is a wealthy, well-educated woman living in small-town 
America. Susan Smith, who was convicted earlier this year of drowning 
her two sons after  claiming they'd been kidnapped, also came from a 
respected, middle-class family.
<p>
What is so horrifyingly inexplicable about the murders of the Green 
and Smith children is that they don't seem to have been committed by 
women driven crazy by drugs or poverty.
<p>
These were coldblooded, calculated murders by women who seemed to lead 
ordinary, even privileged, lives. It's the very familiarity of these 
women's experiences that makes so chilling the evil they perpetrated.
<p>
Stories of women who murder their own children have shocked and 
fascinated us for thousands of years. No figure in Greek mythology 
invokes more dread or loathing than Medea, who killed her own children 
to punish their father, Jason,  for his infidelity.
<p>
In Euripedes' play of the same name, Medea is described by Jason as a 
"hateful thing, you woman most utterly loathed by the gods and me and 
all the race of mankind."
<p>
Last year 538 children in the United States were killed by their 
parents (compared with 308 parents killed by their own children).
<p>
The Justice Department doesn't publish statistics showing how many 
mothers vs. fathers killed their children, although it is difficult to 
imagine that murders by mothers constituted more than a small fraction 
of the total. Difficult to imagine because there is no more horrible 
or unnatural crime than a mother taking the life of her own child.
<p>
Sometimes no amount of analysis or explanation or blame shifting will 
allow us to avoid looking evil straight in the face - even when it 
belongs to a mother.
<p>
What is truly frightening about these recent murders is that they 
demonstrate that evil can exist anywhere, including where it seems 
most unlikely. And it is  more difficult to root out evil than to 
change public policy.
<p>

<h2>Don't Underestimate Taxpayers' Intelligence </h2> 
<P>by <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 

 
As budget negotiations near the crisis stage again next week, expect 
Democrats to demagogue on taxes as they have for the past three years. 
Although President Clinton was elected with a promise to enact a 
middle-class tax cut, he instead raised taxes in 1993. And now he and 
Democrats in Congress want Republicans to scale back the $ 245 billion 
tax cut included in their congressional budget package.
<P>
Democrats believe the key to a balanced budget is higher tax revenues, 
which they think government can magically control by manipulating tax 
rates. The theory is simple enough: Tax the rich at higher rates and 
the government will take in more revenues, which can then be used to 
pay for all those expensive government programs Democrats favor. The 
problem is, it never seems to work out  quite as intended.
<P>
A new study by Harvard Professors Martin Feldstein and Daniel Feenberg 
demonstrates why.
<P>
In 1993, the Clinton tax increase raised marginal tax rates from 31% 
to 36% on incomes between $ 140,000 and $ 250,000 and to 39.6% on 
incomes above $ 250,000. Those tax increases should have produced $ 
19.3 billion in extra revenues if the affected taxpayers had not 
changed their earnings behavior. Instead, the hefty tax hikes produced 
less than half the expected extra revenues - $ 8.4 billion.
<P>
Democrats assume taxpayers are a docile lot. Raise their taxes and 
they'll willingly fork over the extra money to the IRS. In fact, 
taxpayers - rich and not so rich - usually resist government efforts 
to take more of their money by changing their behavior. The rich, in 
particular, have lots of options to avoid  paying more to the IRS, 
including cutting back on their work effort. President Reagan was fond 
of describing his response to the confiscatory marginal tax rate of 
90% that prevailed when he was an actor. He simply quit working when 
he earned enough to put him in the highest bracket. It wasn't worth 
making that next dollar if he only got to keep 10 cents.
<P>
The study shows many wealthy Americans responded to the Clinton tax 
increases the same way. They may have worked less, taken more time 
off, bought more expensive homes with higher mortgages (shielding more 
income with higher home mortgage interest deductions), or given more 
to charity (producing higher charitable tax deductions). By whatever 
means, those in the highest brackets reduced their taxable incomes by 
an estimated 7.8%.
<P>
Some wealthy taxpayers - including Hillary Rodham Clinton - also 
avoided paying the higher 1993 taxes by shifting some of their 
expected 1993 income to 1992. Ordinary workers don't have that luxury, 
but executives, lawyers and other high-income earners sometimes do. 
They can exercise stock options or take some of their future income in 
current year bonuses if they anticipate tax increases  in future 
years. Mrs. Clinton sheltered some of her earnings by taking a year-
end bonus in 1992, thus avoiding paying the higher 1993 taxes.
<P>
It seems never to occur to Democratic politicians that many wealthy 
people got that way by being smart about money. Allow them to keep 
more of what they earn and they'll earn more, in the process creating 
jobs through their investment. But tax them excessively and they will 
figure out ways to keep Uncle Sam from getting a larger share of their 
money. Even Mrs. Clinton found a  way around the 1993 tax increase, 
temporarily putting aside Democratic ideology  when it affected her 
own pocketbook. Maybe it's time Democrats stopped underestimating the 
intelligence of U.S. taxpayers.

<h2>Call it A Miracle </h2> 
<P>by <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 

Call it a miracle - or perhaps just the triumph of tolerance and 
common sense - but there seems to be far less controversy over 
religious displays on public property this holiday season than in 
recent years. Both creches and menorahs are on display - albeit with 
some restrictions - despite the hostility of the ACLU and other groups 
opposed to such exhibits. 
 <P>
In a computer database search of newspaper articles from around the 
country, I found only 59 stories appearing since Dec. 1 that even 
mentioned Nativity displays, and most of these were announcements of 
holiday celebrations and events. 
 <P>
Admittedly, the ACLU did try to silence "Silent Night" and recordings 
of other Christian hymns piped into a government building in Chicago 
this year. But a federal court decided last week that the group was 
off base (as usual) in claiming  a few carols played over a 
government-owned loudspeaker system were an "establishment of 
religion" forbidden by the First Amendment. 
 <P>
Since 1984, when the Supreme Court handed down its first decision 
involving the display of religious symbols on public property, cities 
and towns have been debating just how far they can go in allowing 
Nativity scenes, menorahs, crosses and other symbols depicting 
important religious events. The court's rules - which seem to change 
each season - now permit religious symbols as part of state-sponsored 
displays so long as secular symbols are also included. And last June, 
the court expanded its interpretation, in effect saying jurisdictions 
couldn't interfere with the right of religious groups to put up 
whatever symbols they chose if the jurisdiction gave non-religious 
groups the right to erect secular, political or other non-religious 
displays on public property. Cities and towns now have the choice of 
saying no to everyone or no one. 
 <P>
Sometimes it's hard to remember that the holidays weren't always so 
complicated. Like most Americans over 40, I can remember when religion 
was at the heart of civic celebrations during Christmas. Denver, where 
I grew up, was well known for its wonderful public and private 
Christmas displays. My father always arranged a special family outing 
for the occasion. He piled everyone into the car for an excursion that 
took us throughout the city. First, we headed downtown to 16th Street, 
where the streets and stores were decked out in ornaments and tinsel, 
then to the Civic Center, where the exhibit proclaiming "Joy to the 
World" and "Peace on Earth" lit up the December sky and filled the air 
with music. We usually ended our tour in the east Denver neighborhoods 
best known for their elaborately decorated homes, many with mangers 
and Wise Men adorning the front lawns. 
 <P>
It was on this part of the trip that I first learned about Hanukkah. 
Through some windows, I could see what appeared to be candelabra with 
only a few candles asymmetrically lit. I thought perhaps they were 
special Christmas lights, like the "luminarias" that decorated my 
native New Mexico. But my father explained to me that these were 
Jewish homes celebrating a different holiday altogether - Hanukkah. 
Later I learned that the holiday commemorates the rededication of the 
Temple in Jerusalem in 165 B.C. after the Maccabees' victory over the 
Syrians. 
 <P>
Today children in many cities can learn about the Hanukkah traditions 
in public displays. Members of the Lubavitch community of Hasidic Jews 
erect large outdoor menorahs in parks and other public places across 
the country. 
 <P>
Americans are among the most religious people in the world. The 
radical separationists - who believe the First Amendment requires that 
religion be driven from civic life - are fighting a losing battle. 
America was founded on the freedom of, not from, religion. And there 
is no better way to celebrate that freedom than to welcome all 
religions back into the public square this holiday season.

<h2>GOP Congress: '95 Something to Crow About</h2> 
<P>by <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 

Is the Republican revolution about to fizzle barely one year 
after it began? 
<P>
The Congress has produced no significant legislation. Extremists 
dominate the freshman class in the House. Republicans want to put poor 
children out on the streets and deprive elderly sick people of medical 
care in order to give tax breaks to the rich. The magnificent 
machinery of government has ground to a halt, not once but twice in as 
many months, causing chaos for millions of Americans. And the public 
has had enough. At least that's what the Clinton administration wants 
you to think - and the media has obligingly conveyed the message.
<P>
But before the Clintons order their favorite Arkansas champagne for 
the 1997 inaugural and House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt picks out 
new drapes for the Speaker's office, perhaps it's time to take a 
closer look at just what did happen in 1995.
<P>
The Congress of the United States actually produced a 3,000-page, 
detailed bill that will balance the budget in seven years.
<P>
Sure, the president vetoed it, but the feat is historic nonetheless. 
The Democrats couldn't come close to offering a balanced budget in 
their years at the helm - even when they controlled both the 
legislative and executive branches, as they did in the Clinton 
administration's first two years.
<P>
Republicans have taken on the first major entitlement programs - 
Medicare and Medicaid - putting principle before politics. For years, 
Republicans have been going after the small potatoes entitlements, 
such as AFDC and food stamps. These programs, while unpopular, make up 
only a small fraction of the federal budget, roughly 3%.
<P>
The really big money entitlements are Social Security and Medicare, 
which go mostly to the middle class, and Medicaid, which goes to the 
poor. These items account for more than one third of the entire 
federal budget.
<P>
Democrats have never been willing to even try to rein in these 
entitlements. But this year Republicans have risked their own re-
election in order to stop burying future generations in debt. For this 
Republicans - and especially the 73 House freshmen - have been labeled 
"extremists," not only by the president but by much of the media.
<P>
Republicans have permanently altered the terms of the debate on 
welfare. Even Democrats sound hardline about ending welfare dependency 
these days. No one argues for welfare rights' or defends welfare 
recipients who stay on the rolls year after year. And virtually 
everyone now agrees that the War on Poverty failed, not for lack of 
funds after more than $ 5 trillion spent in three decades, but because 
the programs themselves were misguided.
<P>
Democrats still cling to the demonstrably erroneous notion that 
expensive government training programs are necessary to get recipients 
off welfare and into jobs.      But when the president finally signs 
welfare reform legislation - as he must soon or face the consequences 
at the polls next year - it will bear a decidedly Republican stamp, 
devolving responsibility back to the states and giving states more 
leeway to limit dependency and discourage illegitimacy.
<P>
Republicans forced Congress to live by the same rules it cavalierly 
mandated for others and to stop accepting gifts and entertainment from 
lobbyists.
<P>
For years when Democrats controlled both Houses, Congress exempted 
itself from laws it insisted other employers obey: civil rights laws, 
health and safety laws, labor relations laws. In recent years, 
Republicans began drawing attention to this Democrat hypocrisy by 
offering amendments to make Congress subject to the same laws it 
applied to others - to no avail.
<P>
Republicans won their battle only when they won control of Congress. 
Suddenly even Democrats decided maybe no one should be above the law - 
not even Congress, now that they no longer controlled it.
<P>
The same thing happened with lobby reform. Democrats had no interest 
in lobby reform when they occupied the powerful committee 
chairmanships. But once they became backbenchers they were more than 
happy to jump on the Republican freshmen's lobby reform bandwagon.      
These Republicans accomplishments may not yet constitute a revolution. 
But they add up to the most significant legislative reforms in a 
decade - not bad for one year's effort.  
<P>

<title>du Pont:   Shakespeare and Medical Savings Accounts  -- 1/16/96
</title>

<center><i>January 16, 1996</i><hr>

<h2>
Shakespeare and Medical Savings Accounts 
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>
"Fair is foul, and foul is fair." 
<P> 
Thus incant the three "weird sisters" usually referred to as witches - 
at the outset of Shakespeare's "MacBeth", as they set forth the 
proposition that what is good will be made bad and what is bad will be 
made good. 
 <P>
In like manner, three nationally syndicated columnists - Joan Beck, 
Molly Ivins and Jane Bryant Quinn - have recently stirred the pot, 
proclaiming a fair health care reform proposal foul and a foul one 
fair. 
 <P>
All three columnists attack the idea of Medical Savings Accounts 
(MSAs), particularly the Republican proposal to provide Medicare 
beneficiaries with an MSA option. 
 <P>
Currently, most people get their health insurance either through their 
employer, or from the federal government through Medicare and 
Medicaid.  In the past, most employers offered a health insurance 
policy with a deductible up front, and then people had to pay, say, 
20% of their medical bills up to a maximum amount. Increasingly, 
companies are moving to health maintenance organizations (HMOs) or 
other types of managed care. 
 <P>
An MSA permits a third option.  A person may take the same money that 
is currently spent on that low-deductible policy or HMO and purchase a 
less-expensive, high-deductible health insurance policy, say, with a 
$3,000 deductible.  The money that is saved by purchasing that less 
expensive policy is then deposited by the employer in a Medical 
Savings Account and can be used during the year to pay smaller health 
care bills. Any unspent money in the account at the end of the year 
can be withdrawn or rolled over and grow with interest to be used for 
health care in the future. 
 <P>
In attacking MSAs, the three columnists quickly assert that fair is 
foul.  Joan Beck claims that "the idea of Medical Savings Accounts is 
largely an untried idea." 
 <P>
Not true.  Congressman Matt Salmon (R-AZ), testifying recently before 
the House Subcommittee on Civil Service, said that there are some 
3,000 U.S. businesses that have adopted some form of MSA.  Abroad, in 
1984 the country of Singapore adopted a "Medisave" program  
as the primary means of paying for health care. Today, Singaporeans 
have access to the same technology as most European countries, with 
hospital stays equaling those of aggressive managed care firms in the 
U.S., but they are only spending 3.1% of their GDP (compared to about 
14% in the U.S.). 
 <P>
Jane Bryant Quinn thinks that only healthy and wealthy people would 
want an MSA, but   during the same congressional hearing, everyone 
testifying -- some of whom had implemented MSA plans for their own 
employees -- found that both the healthy and sick benefited 
financially from the plans.  The healthy benefited because they got to 
keep the unspent MSA balance at the end of the year, and the sick 
because they spent less money out of pocket, since their exposure was 
limited to the MSA amount.  Insurance paid 100% of the rest.  
 <P>
Molly Ivins thinks that Republican support of MSAs is the result of 
recent lobbying by special interest insurance companies looking to 
make money off selling the MSA plans.  But the MSA idea goes back to 
the mid-1980s; several think tanks and congressmen -- including those 
now in the Republican leadership -- have supported the idea for years.  
Further, most large insurance companies have opposed all MSA 
legislation for the very reason that it would encourage individuals to 
retain some of the money they had been giving to the insurance 
companies.  (As in "MacBeth", you know the world is topsy-turvy when 
Molly Ivins would rather people give their money to insurance 
companies than keep it themselves.) 
 <P>
All of the above columnists also think that foul is fair -- that MSAs 
would undermine the Medicare system.  Surely a system that is by 
everyone's count going bankrupt in seven years is already undermined.  
Medicare has been plagued with exploding costs and suffocating 
regulations for years. 
 <P>
MSAs are simply not a radical idea.  Indeed, most self-employed 
individuals who purchase a health insurance policy on their own -- and 
thus don't perceive the employer or government as providing a health 
insurance policy free -- usually choose a high-deductible policy and 
pay for smaller medical expenditures out of pocket.  All an MSA does 
is provide individuals or their employers with the opportunity -- not 
a requirement -- to put a limited amount of tax-free money in an 
account to pay those smaller medical bills. 
 <P>
Congressional Republicans are trying to fix and preserve Medicare by 
providing senior citizens with private sector options such as MSAs.  
By contrast, these columnists criticize the plan as threatening to an 
already bankrupt system.   
 <P>
Their solution is to stir the pot and chant:  "Double double toil and 
trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble."  It may be good theater, and 
even good liberal politics, but it won't help Americans get better 
health care.

<h2>Time For A New Tax System</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>
The objective of the Tax Reform Commission appointed by Speaker 
Gingrich and Majority Leader Dole was, in the words of its chairman, 
Jack Kemp, "to tear apart the whole tax code...and draft...a dramatic 
reform." 
 <P>
As a member of the Commission, I believe the report we issued on 
January 17th completed this mission. 
 <P>
The tax code as it exists today is unjust and unfair. Its definitions 
are complex, its regulations often incomprehensible, and its 
enforcement ranges from lax to nasty.  It is a politicized method of 
unequally extracting income from people who have earned it and 
transferring it to people who haven't, but who the politicians in 
Congress think have a superior claim to it.  Sugar and ethanol 
producers, drug addicts who need federal dollars to support their 
habits, and pornographic arts programs come to mind. Congress simply 
uses the code to reward its friends, punish its enemies, and - of 
course - to get itself re-elected. 
 <P>
The income tax takes as much as 40% of what we earn each year, and 
half of anything left over when we die - the family farm, the small 
business we have built, or the savings we have worked so hard to 
accumulate.  Compliance takes 5.4 billion hours of our time, and if we 
disagree with the IRS, the burden of proof is on us - we are guilty 
until we prove ourselves innocent.  The IRS can search our property 
without a warrant and seize our assets without a trial. 
 <P>
One of the brutal byproducts of the tax code is stagnating incomes for 
individuals but galloping revenues for government.  Between 1973 and 
1993 annual income growth for middle class and low-income wage earners 
has remained flat.  In roughly the same period (1973-1995) government 
"take home pay" has increased 58% in real terms.  Family earnings have 
not risen, while the government's have increased 58%.  There's 
fairness for you. 
 <P>
The members of the Tax Reform Commission believe it is time to repeal 
this whole sorry mess and begin again.  A new tax system proposed by 
the Commission would be based upon three principles. 
 <P>
First, a generous personal exemption.  The Commission did not set a 
number, but for discussion  let's use $7,500 ($30,000 for a family of 
four) on which no income tax at all would be due. 
 <P>
Second, earnings above that amount would be taxed at a uniform, low 
rate, say, 19%.  (again, my hypothetical rate, not the Commission's.)  
All taxpayers would pay the same rate of tax, which is not only fair 
but presumably what the Constitution means by "equal protection of the 
laws."  The rate could only be increased by a two-thirds supermajority 
vote of each House of Congress. 
 <P>
Such a tax system would be progressive.  As the table shows, with a 
19% rate, the wealthy family of four would pay a higher percentage of 
its income in taxes than a middle-income family. 
 <P>
<pre>
	Income        	Taxable Income     Tax Due      Tax As a % of Income 
	$ 30,000           	$0               			0                   		0 
	45,000            	15,000        			2,850                 6.3% 
	60,000            	30,000        			5,700                 9.5% 
	120,000            	90,000       			17,100                14.3% 
 </pre>

<P>
The Commission's third principle is that income should be taxed only 
once.  This would make the employee's half of Social Security taxes 
deductible and eliminate the double taxation of investment income.  It 
would also eliminate death taxes and the alternative minimum tax. 
 <P>
The adoption of such a progressive, uniform tax rate system would 
cause an explosion of growth in the American economy, creating 
millions of new jobs and billions of dollars of take-home pay.  The 
Hall-Rabushka flat-tax proposal was estimated to increase economic 
growth a full percentage point per year.  Although that increase may 
seem small, a percentage point increase in the growth of the economy 
translates into 6 million jobs and two trillion dollars in real 
economic productivity over 8 years.  It would also increase government 
tax revenue by nearly $700 billion. 
 <P>
By discouraging investment, innovation, and the taking of risk, the 
current tax code is restraining the U.S. economy's growth rate to 
about 2.5% per year.  With a progressive flat tax, the economy could 
be growing 4%, or perhaps more, which would bring real increases in 
their quality of life to tens of millions of American families. 
 <P>
That is the goal of the Tax Reform Commission's proposal:  to increase 
jobs, growth, income, and the quality of life.  With our current tax 
code, these things are impossible.  With a progressive flat tax, they 
can be achieved.

<h2>The 1996 Election:  A Choice of Visions</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>  
 <p>

The football season and the State of the Union message are behind us.  
In another few weeks the election of 1996 will be upon us.  In these 
few days of calm before the Iowa caucus, we need to reflect upon the 
social and political transitions of our times and how they impact the 
November elections. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We live in a society that is being transformed by forces largely 
outside of our control.  We are caught in a transition from the old 
industrial, hierarchical, mass production society to the individualism 
of an Information Age. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, it is not our nation's first transition.  Historians tell 
us that there have been three American Republics.  The first stretched 
from the adoption of the Constitution in 1789 to the Civil War.  We 
might call that the Age of Federalism, a time of decentralized 
government power with a strong emphasis on individual responsibility. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Second Republic lasted until the Great Depression of the 1930s.  
It was a time of growing federal power and involvement in our lives.  
We might call it the Age of Government Expansion.  
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Third Republic was the political, governmental and social 
transformation created by the New Deal.  This one's easy to tag:  it 
was the Age of the Welfare State. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The beginning of the end of the New Deal era came with the election of 
Ronald Reagan in 1980.  But the actual end of liberalism came 14 years 
later -- after the collapse of communism as an organizing principle of 
society - when control of the U.S. House of Representatives passed 
into conservative hands. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the words of MIT professor Rudi Dornbusch:  "Statism has had its 
time on the stage.  Pervasive regulation, public-sector enterprises, a 
bloated welfare state with crushing tax burdens of those who work - 
and absurd levels of subsidies for those who don't - have failed as 
effective alternatives to decentralized decision-making...." 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So the election of 1996 is not about Bob Dole or Bill Clinton, the 
elimination of the Commerce Department, or Haiti, Hooters or hand-gun 
control.  The election of 1996 is about a choice of visions to guide 
us in the Fourth Republic. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;First is the choice between collective and individual decision-making.  
Will the government make decisions for you, or will you make your own 
decisions?  The resolution of this conflict will determine whether you 
or the government will invest your retirement savings, whether you or 
the  
government will decide which school your child attends, whether you or 
the government will decide which doctor you see. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The welfare statist says it is better that government make these 
decisions for us; the advocates of liberty believe we are capable of 
making them for ourselves. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second choice is whether equality or freedom will be the core of 
our vision.  The liberal vision worries that if people are allowed to 
be free, they will become unequal, and that will be unfair.  So 
government must count outcomes by race, hue, gender, age, sexual 
preference, etc., and then enforce remedial policies to make sure that 
no group gains relative to any other. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The conservative vision, by contrast, recognizes that whenever 
equality has been the driving force, freedom has been the first 
casualty.  The advocates of liberty believe the individual should be 
free to go as far as his or her efforts, talents and energy will 
allow, regardless of race, color or creed. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Finally, there is the choice of whether the state or the individual 
should be held responsible for moral conduct and the spiritual 
dimension of our lives.  The liberal vision sees the state as the 
repository of virtue and therefore responsible for morality.  When 
something goes wrong it is the fault of the state, not the individual, 
so the state must act.  Conversely, the conservative vision sees the 
individual as responsible for his or her own actions, and the sum of 
these actions sets society's moral course. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In any transition the challenge for political leaders is not to stop 
it - they cannot - but to advance a vision for that transformation 
compatible with our constitutional traditions of liberty, justice, and 
limited government. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;President Clinton's vision reflects the faith in government of the 
Third Republic.  His veto pen has struck down a balanced budget and a 
reform of welfare as we know it.  His top domestic priority is to 
ensure that the government is "never, ever" shut down again. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But by its very nature an accelerating flow of information is 
decentralizing, increasing individual power and choices.  It will 
transform not only our lives, but our government as well.  The 
conservative vision, anchored in the liberty established by the 
Founding Fathers in the First Republic, is the only one compatible 
with the individualism demanded by an information society. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Choosing between these competing visions for the Fourth Republic is 
what the 1996 election is all about.

<h2>The Republican Dilemma: Growth Or Green Eye Shades?
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Pete du Pont
</a>

<P>  
Sixteen months into the conservative revolution that swept the field 
in the 1994 elections, the liberals are winning the war. They lost the 
battle at the polls but they are winning the war in the trenches of 
the Congress and the sound bites of the evening news. 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reason is that the argument in Washington - and thus on the 
television - has been about the deficit and the cruel spending cuts 
the Republicans have enacted to reduce it.  When the Republicans 
propose reducing the rate of increase in spending for program A from 
9% per year to 7% (when the annual inflation rate is less than 3%), 
President Clinton brands them harsh and heartless. In due course 
people across America begin to believe it, and then such a modest 
reduction in future growth is thought to be "extreme," and "going too 
far too fast." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160 
Republicans shouldn't be surprised, for it comes with the territory. 
Being portrayed as mean spirited is the price to be paid for becoming 
the Green Eyeshade political party - that is, paying more attention to 
bookkeeping than to vision. When balancing the budget becomes your 
goal, and budget scoring becomes your god, you lose. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
Once upon a time the Republicans were the party of growth.  Ronald 
Reagan ran and won on a program of 30% income tax rate cuts. It 
worked.  Eighteen million net new jobs were added to the economy, 
economic growth rates averaged nearly 4% per year after the tax rates 
kicked in, and federal tax revenues rose by 26% during President 
Reagan's two terms. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
A growth policy would work again.  There is no way to reduce the 
deficit more efficiently and more painlessly than with a higher rate 
of economic growth.  And there is no way of reducing the need for 
welfare spending more rapidly and more permanently than by achieving 
higher incomes for everyone. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
A successful fiscal policy must include two vital elements.  Slowing 
the growth of government spending is one.  But encouraging economic 
growth is a higher priority, for it also creates jobs and increases 
take home pay, as well as reducing the deficit through greater tax 
receipts. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
Such a policy should begin with enactment of the core pro-growth tax 
reduction programs of the Contract With America. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
Cutting and indexing the capital gains tax would quickly stimulate 
growth by unlocking billions of dollars of assets. Expanding the use 
of Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), and repealing the Social 
Security benefits tax would increase growth, too.  Raising the amount 
that retirees can earn without loss of benefits would expand the 
supply of elderly workers, help employers meet their demands for 
skilled labor over the next decade and increase federal revenue. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
Second, instead of pursuing deficit reduction as the primary goal of 
economic policy, Republicans should advocate a policy of aggressive 
deregulation to encourage economic growth.  Free farmers from acreage 
restrictions so they can grow more crops while phasing out subsidies, 
thus reducing spending. Deregulate communications to unleash high-tech 
growth.  Replace welfare programs with work to increase labor output 
at the lower end of the economic scale.  Allow parents to choose the 
best schools for their children to spur long range economic growth by 
improving the skills of the workforce.  Begin the transfer of 
retirement saving from the Social Security system to individually 
owned marketplace IRAs. They would grow both the retirement income of 
older Americans and the savings pool of the nation to fuel even more 
prosperity. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160 
Finally, pick up on the growth ideas of the Tax Reform Commission: 
repeal the existing tax code and replace it with a single-rate, 
progressive flat tax. The resulting  explosion of growth would create 
millions of new jobs and billions of dollars in increased personal 
income.  The Hall-Rabuska flat tax proposal was estimated to increase 
economic growth a full percentage point per year. Although that 
increase may seem small, a percentage point increase in the growth of 
the economy translates into six million jobs and two trillion dollars 
in real economic productivity over eight years.  It would also 
increase government tax revenue by nearly $700 billion, allowing 
Republicans spooked by the deficit to reduce it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160 
That is an economic program worth expending political blood and 
treasure to enact.   
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
Let the liberals take the other side - that the tax reductions are 
growing the economy too fast, creating too many jobs, and giving 
people too much freedom and too much money. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160 
Republicans can reply that Democratic proposals to reduce the economic 
growth rate from 4% to 3.5% are cruel and heartless. The evening news 
will be filled with shots of disappointed men and women who had been 
counting on putting a new roof on the house or their daughter through 
college. Congressional Budget Office scorers could be furloughed as 
non-essential employees.  And the deficit would go down.  And who 
knows, even the Green Eyeshade Republicans might be happy.

<title>du Pont: Even Unions Want This Free Market Idea  -- 2/8/96</title>
</head>

<h2>
Even Unions Want This Free Market Idea 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
dupont

Pete du Pont 
</a>
<p>
<i>Congress may soon make Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) the law of the 
land.  And even labor unions like the idea.   </i>
 

<P>
Medical Savings Accounts give people the opportunity to move from a 
conventional, low-deductible health insurance plan to one with a high 
deductible (say $2,000 to $3,000) and to put the premium savings in a 
medical  savings account.  Employees and their families pay all 
medical bills up to the deductible from their MSAs and out-of-pocket.  
Insurance then covers 100% of everything else. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The political battle for MSAs has been long and hard, but even when 
the political battle is over, the fighting will continue.  That's 
because the real issue behind the MSA debate is who will control our 
health care dollars.  MSA supporters want individuals to control more 
of their health care dollars;  MSA opponents want someone other than 
the patient - a manager, "gatekeeper" or bureaucrat - to control those 
dollars. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
It is becoming the ultimate in populist vs. elitist battles, and 
nowhere is that more evident than in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, a 
suburb of Philadelphia. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
During 1995 contract negotiations between teachers at the Bucks County 
Technical School and officials of the Bucks County School Board, the 
issue of the high cost of health care became a topic for discussion.  
Members of the Bucks County Technical School  teachers union  had 
recently heard of Medical Savings Accounts and thought that by 
shifting to an MSA plan, both the teachers and the administration 
could benefit.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
They learned that some 3,000 businesses have adopted some form of MSA 
plan.  The apparently universal experience is that MSA plans reduce 
employers' health insurance expenditures over time and permit 
employees to benefit financially by managing their health care dollars 
wisely.  A win-win situation for everyone involved. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ed Moffit, who teaches air-conditioning and refrigeration technology 
for the school and is president of the teachers' union, optimistically 
presented the idea to the Board.  After all, the money employees spend 
for health insurance ultimately belongs to the employee.  He thought 
the Board would be delighted that a union was proposing a free-market 
solution to their health care dilemma.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
He was wrong. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Board's solution to restraining health care spending was to move 
the teachers out of their fee-for-service policy and into a managed 
care plan, lowering the Board's cost and pocketing the difference.  
Unwilling to let a managed care plan make choices for them, union 
members opposed the school's solution. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The battle thickened.  Moffit and the union publicly asked the school 
Board to release information about the union members' health care 
costs.  Finally it did, and now pressure is building for MSAs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What the Bucks County Technical School Education Association has 
learned is what union members and employees across the country are 
learning - MSAs make sense.  For example:  
<BR> 
*&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1994, the United Mine Workers adopted an MSA-type proposal by 
providing members with a $1,000 deductible policy and writing them a 
check for $1,000 at the beginning of the year. 
<br>
*&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;City employees in  Jersey City, New Jersey, get an $1,800 MSA 
contribution to a family plan and a $2,000 deductible - and the 
average MSA refund was about $1,000 at the end of the first year. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Union members often have the most comprehensive health insurance plans 
in the country, often costing well above the national average of about 
$5,000 for a family plan.  As a result, union members who choose a 
less expensive catastrophic plan can have a significant amount of 
money left over to deposit in their MSA, and most would have a nice 
bonus waiting for them at the end of the year. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
But as the Bucks County experience makes clear, management often 
mistakenly  thinks it knows best.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
For example, in recent testimony before Congress, John N. Sturdivant, 
president of the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, 
which represents 700,000 federal and District of Columbia employees, 
declared that "people are willing to accept limitations on their 
choice of providers in exchange for more comprehensive benefits and 
lower out-of-pocket costs."  Translation: Mr. Sturdivant wants your 
choices limited if it will save a little money. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
And, he added, "Under MSAs . . .consumers would delay treatment until 
it was absolutely necessary."  Translation: You can't be trusted with 
the money because you're too stupid to make good health care decisions 
for yourself.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Condescension, whether practiced by management or union leaders, is a 
poor substitute for individual empowerment.  There is no reason to 
think that the Bucks County School Board or John Sturdivant or anyone 
else besides you and your physician should make decisions about your 
health care.  Medical Savings Accounts will give you that opportunity.

<title>du Pont: Prospecting the Federal Government: How Buchanan Found In Alaska -- 3/7/96</title>

<h2>
Prospecting the Federal Government: How Buchanan Found Gold In Alaska
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
dupont
.html">
Pete du Pont 
</a>
<p>

Pat Buchanan is running hard and strong, perplexing all the pundits in 
the process.  His issues, mostly trade, immigration and abortion, 
appear to be resonating with a sizable block of voters.  But, there's 
a broader message here - Pat is tapping into a rich vein of distrust 
and disgust with the national government. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Consider the first caucus he won, in what would have seemed the 
unlikely jurisdiction of Alaska.  Unlikely, that is, until we consider 
Alaska's treatment at the hands of the federal government during its 
almost four decades of statehood.  It's a treatment that makes the 
state fertile ground for a candidate seeking to harvest people's 
growing frustrations with the intrusiveness of Washington. 
 <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In 1958, the citizens of the Alaskan territory voted by a margin of 
more than 5 to 1 to accept Washington's offer of statehood. The 
proclamation signed by President Eisenhower on January 3, 1959 made 
Alaska our 49th state, guaranteeing it "equal footing" with the other 
48 states. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
But, that's not the way it turned out.  Instead, Alaskans have 
witnessed one attempt after another - some successful, some not - on 
the part of the federal government to change elements of the original 
statehood "contract." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
As part of Alaska's statehood, it was agreed that the federal 
government would be entitled to 10% of any oil revenues arising from 
federal lands.  Yet, in 1964, the federal government unsuccessfully 
tried to increase its share to 75% of oil revenues from the Kenai 
Peninsula. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
While it was always expected that the federal government would own and 
manage vast acreage within their state, many Alaskans no doubt felt 
shocked and betrayed in 1980, when President Carter signed the Alaska 
National Interest Lands Act.  The Act gave to the federal government 
much of the state's most valuable acreage, or acreage that blocked 
usage of valuable acreage in private and state hands. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Commonwealth North, a group of prominent Alaskans, notes the federal 
intrusiveness that arises from the large size and unfortunate (from 
Alaska's viewpoint) placement of federal land ownership within Alaska, 
noting there are actually 54 different ruling "governors" that have a 
say over land usage.  These include park superintendents, wildlife 
refuge superintendents, etc. that rule over different federal land 
units within Alaska.  Sadly for Alaska's citizens, these authorities 
are appointed in Washington, and have no reason to answer to the 
people of Alaska.  Predictably, their rule can be capricious and 
inconsistent. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
The prohibitions against developing some federal land, or even using 
it to get from private or state-owned land to deep water ports and 
other elements of business infrastructure, make it impossible to 
accomplish much economic development.  This especially hurts Alaska's 
attempts to shift its economy away from its dependence on oil. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
But, even when Alaskans can work with the land, their hands are often 
tied.  For example, the natural markets for oil extracted from 
Alaska's North Slope would be nations on the Pacific Rim, including 
Japan.  Yet, until very recently, federal law prohibited Alaska from 
exporting this oil to Japan, which resulted in Alaskan oil passing 
through the Panama Canal on the way to a Gulf port, while oil from 
Mexico headed in the other direction on its way to the Pacific Rim. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Washington's attempts at environmental micro-management  have also 
severely impacted Alaska.  74% of Alaska's non-mountainous land area 
falls under the definition of wetlands, and so is managed in 
Washington.  So are fisheries and timber.  Alaska's everyday life is a 
series of David and Goliath-like clashes with a distant national 
government. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Our federal government seems to have broken its promises to Alaska - 
to have told its biggest lies to our biggest state.  Since statehood, 
Alaska has suffered from laws that were passed and administered by 
people sitting in Washington, people who were either unaware, or 
didn't care, how those laws would affect the people in Alaska.  And, 
this has been done with the usual Washington arrogance that it knows 
better than the people of Alaska what is good for them and their 
state.   
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
No wonder Pat Buchanan won the Alaska caucuses.  And, while it remains 
to be seen if his win was the first step toward the presidential 
nomination, or just the start of a good month that ended after New 
Hampshire, there is one real concern that we should address.  If 
Washington treats Alaska, a state that sits 5000 miles away and is 
primarily wilderness, so shabbily, just think what it's doing to the 
rest of us.

<h2>
Reviving The Growth Agenda
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Pete du Pont 
</a>

<P>
The campaigns of Steve Forbes and Pat Buchanan resonated with voters 
this primary season  because they were the only two candidates running 
who directly addressed the problem of economic growth.  Inside the 
Beltway everything seems fine - and why not?  Bill Clinton has created 
lots of employment for policy wonks, with his everchanging agenda of 
plans to nationalize health care, raise taxes, and pay people to 
become "volunteers."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But out in the real world things are not so rosy. The latest 
government data confirm what voters see: the economy is flat;  there 
is little economic growth.  In the fourth quarter, real GDP grew less 
than 1 percent.  In all of 1995 the economy only grew about 2 percent 
- down sharply from the 3.5 percent rate registered in 1994.  In fact, 
during the three years of Clinton's presidency, growth has only 
averaged about 2.6 percent per year.  The Clinton Administration would 
have us believe that two and a half percent annual growth is fine, 
maybe the best we can do.  In fact, the administration warns against 
efforts to raise the growth rate because it would be inflationary.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But not so long ago we did a lot better.  Real  growth averaged 3.4 
percent per year for eight years of the Reagan administration - 
including the effects of a deep recession.  If we leave out the 
recession and look only at the last six years of the Reagan 
Administration, real GDP growth averaged 4.5 percent per year.  And 
this was accomplished while inflation fell from 12.5 percent in 1980 
to just 1.1 percent in 1986.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So the lesson of the 1980s is that it is possible to have faster 
growth - well above the two and a half percent rate that Clinton's 
economists tell us is the best we can do - without inflation.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
How did Reagan do it?  He did it by reducing the burden of government.  
Taxes were cut, the growth of spending was scaled back, and the burden 
of regulation was slashed.  Taxes fell from 19.6 percent of GDP in 
1980 to 18.9 percent in 1988.  Outlays fell from 22.3 percent to 22.1 
percent over the same period.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But perhaps even more important was Reagan's assault on federal 
regulation.  According to Professor Thomas Hopkins of the Rochester 
Institute of Technology, the cost of federal regulation fell from 11.3 
percent of GDP in 1980 to 8.1 percent in 1988.  In other words, the 
reduction in the burden of regulation during the Reagan years was far 
greater than the reduction in the fiscal burden.  Since 1988, 
unfortunately, the burden of regulation has risen again and is now 
back to 9 percent of GDP, according to Prof. Hopkins.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So why are Republicans so reluctant to defend the overwhelming 
economic success of the Reagan years?  Many have bought the liberal 
line that growth was bought "on credit" with higher deficits, and that 
Reagan's tax cuts were a giveaway to the rich that only increased 
income inequality.  This started with President Bush, who always 
seemed somewhat embarrassed by Reagan - it is hard to know how else to 
interpret the "kinder and gentler" line in his inaugural address. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The consequence is, as economist Paul Craig Roberts points out, that 
Republicans have handicapped themselves in addressing the growth issue 
because they neither understand the Reagan record nor are willing to 
defend it with enthusiasm.  Moderate Republicans have become so 
obsessed with the budget deficit that they are incapable of looking at 
tax cuts except as a loss of revenue. In spite of the Reagan growth 
record, lower taxes only  equal higher deficits in their limited, 
accountant's mentality.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To be sure, the House and Senate have voted to cut the capital gains 
tax and scale back regulation.  But at the first sign of resistance 
from the Clinton Administration, Republicans  backed off.  Apparently, 
in their heart of hearts, many agree that cutting the capital gains 
tax only enriches the rich, and that more government regulation is 
necessary to protect the environment, schools, and various economic 
constituencies.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Into this self-created Republican vacuum stepped Pat Buchanan and 
Steve Forbes.  Buchanan's message of isolation and trade protection  
is a false vision, and a counterproductive approach to economic 
malaise.  But Pat offered solutions, and  it is a political fact of 
life that even bad ideas will beat no ideas every time.  Steve's ideas 
of hope, growth, and opportunity were much stronger, and offer a way 
out of the current Republican malaise.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Growing the economy - creating jobs, new businesses and opportunities 
- is neither impossible nor dangerous.  President Kennedy did it with 
tax cuts.  President Reagan did it with tax cuts, slower spending 
growth, and deregulation.   It worked twice and it will work again - 
if Republicans will just do it.

<html><head><title>du Pont: The Failure of Protectionism -- 4/04/96
 </title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><i>Thursday, April 4, 1996 </i><h2> The Failure of Protectionism 
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html">Pete du Pont </a><P>

 

 
The Great Wall of China dates from the Ming dynasty (1368-
1644), but successive invasions from the North proved that 
it had no more military utility than the "impregnable" 
Maginot Line did for the French in 1940.  Gunpowder and 
artillery long ago had rendered castle walls useless too.   
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The failure of walls to provide military security has not 
discouraged a tough-talking Pat Buchanan from centering his 
presidential campaign around trade walls to enhance our 
economic security.  Unfortunately, economic walls make no 
more sense in the modern world than do castle walls for 
military protection.   
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Logic rejects protectionism, for a wider choice of goods at 
varying  prices benefits consumers.  Experience has backed 
up the logic.  The 1930s, of course, are exhibit A.  To save 
jobs, two Republicans, Representative Willis C. Hawley of 
Oregon and Senator Reed Smoot of Utah, crafted a bill to 
raise a massive tax wall around the U.S. economy.  Signed 
into law in 1930 by another Republican, President Herbert C. 
Hoover, foreign trade plummeted, handsomely aided by the 
retaliatory tax burdens erected by other governments.  The 
ensuing mass unemployment and desperation throughout the 
industrial world led to dictators and semi-dictators, who, 
in turn, took the steps from trade war to actual war.  
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Learning this lesson, 1945's victorious allies were 
determined to work to reduce tariffs and eliminate other 
barriers to international cooperation.  The much-denounced 
GATT, or General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, was the 
primary means chosen to promote open international trade.  
To be sure, multilateral agreements have blemishes and raise 
sovereignty issues, but there is no gain saying that GATT has 
worked.  World trade has been kept relatively open and now 
tops $4 trillion per year in merchandise alone, not to 
mention an enormous daily volume in services, investments 
and financial transactions across national borders.   
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Not that economic logic and facts are likely to deter a 
bellicose Pat Buchanan.  It is easy to arouse tribal 
resentment, but a wall around U.S. business is the last way 
in the world to appease Americans' longing for a better 
life.  Protecting companies from competition will not make 
us rich.  On the contrary, open trading, both foreign and 
domestic, is the key to wealth.  We should make trade 
easier, not harder.   
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Protection may work in a distorted way in the short run, 
holding a few visible jobs in companies that would otherwise 
"rightsize" or disappear.  But it cannot work in the long 
run to boost jobs and wages.  Protectionism rewards the 
inefficient and penalizes the efficient.  As economist 
Ludwig von Mises put it, "The history of mankind is a long 
record of obstacles placed in the way of the more efficient 
for the benefit of the less efficient."  A few politically 
visible jobs are protected by interference at the cost of 
many better-paying jobs destroyed elsewhere. 
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Over the longer run, government protection fails to create 
jobs and prosperity in the most protected industries.  Take 
the maritime industry, for example.  Once a great seafaring 
nation, the United States became much less competitive 
during the 20th century.  Heavily subsidized and unionized, 
our domestic maritime trade is completely reserved to 
American-built, American-owned and American-crewed vessels.  
The consequence has been high-priced monopoly service 
between U.S. ports, costing consumers higher prices for 
goods and, yes, costing U.S. sailors their jobs. 
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
How has the maritime industry fared under its 75-year 
protected monopoly created by the Jones Act of 1920?   In 
1950, the U.S. flag fleet consisted of a thousand ships; a 
half-century of subsidy later, there are less than 200.  In 
1950, U.S. flag vessels carried 43% of America's foreign 
trade; today they carry less than 4%.  In 1950, 57,000 
Americans had jobs in our merchant fleet; today less than 
9,000 go  to sea in U.S. flag ships.   
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A 1991 International Trade Commission study put the 
inefficiency costs of the Jones Act at $3.6 billion to $9.8 
billion annually. 
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Protectionism simply cannot work.  Technologies and 
industries rise and fall, expand and contract, come and go.  
The reasons are diverse but foreign competition is  one of 
the minor factors in our huge, global-size economy.  
Economic change is an asset, not a liability, as new 
technologies and cost reductions bring wider consumer 
choice.  We have nothing to fear from better or cheaper 
foreign products.    
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 Centuries ago, the English King Canute stood at the water's 
edge and forbade the tide to come in.  He was no more 
successful than America can be in trying to keep out foreign 
goods and services in the age of the Internet and global 
economics.  The daily ebb and flow of the tides is central 
to global ecology, just as trade is to a global economy.

<h2>   
The Forbes Legacy   
 </h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
dupont

Pete du Pont 
</a>
<p>


One great strength of the American political system - and one that no   
doubt baffles foreigners - is the way it brings people who are enemies   
one day  together as allies the next.  Just recently we saw Phil   
Gramm,  Lamar Alexander and Steve Forbes attacking Bob Dole in  Iowa   
and New Hampshire. But just a  few weeks later, Gramm, Alexander and   
Forbes all dropped out of the race and endorsed him.   
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

The flip side of this phenomenon is that Dole has suddenly  found   
merit in ideas put forward by his previous opponents.  Just a few   
short weeks ago, on March 4, Dole had  nothing good to say about the   
Forbes flat tax.  While campaigning in New York in advance of that   
state's primary, Dole strenuously  attacked the flat tax for   
eliminating deductions for mortgage  interest and charitable   
deductions, and for increasing the deficit. But now, Dole has   
apparently decided that the flat tax is not  a bad idea after all.  As   
the New York Times put it, "Mr. Dole is  now talking about a flat tax   
proposal of his own, something his  aides hint he would have announced   
sooner if Mr. Forbes had not  grabbed the issue first."   
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

While to some, such behavior may prove the fecklessness of American   
politicians, in truth it is an essential strength of  our system.    
Good ideas are not banished from the political  process just because   
they had the bad luck to be promoted by a  losing candidate.  On the   
contrary, like flowers in the desert, they bloom again and again.  In   
fact, competition for ideas  generally works the same way as   
competition for goods in the  marketplace.  The best tend to prevail   
despite adversity.   
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

The fact is that ideas often win by losing. Norman Thomas, the   
Socialist candidate for  president in the 1930s, was one of the most   
unsuccessful  candidates in history, yet virtually all of his   
proposals - higher taxes, old age pensions, public power and flood   
control, and unemployment insurance - were ultimately adopted by the   
Democratic Party and enacted into law.   On the conservative side,   
Barry Goldwater's losing campaign in  1964 was equally "successful",   
although not until his ideas were adopted after the election of    
Ronald Reagan 16 years later.      
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

My own experience in the 1988 campaign proves the point.  My proposal   
for school choice, opposed by Bush, Dole, Kemp and, of course, all the   
Democrats, is now Republican policy, and is even being enacted in some   
communities and states across the country.  Similarly, a market-based   
alternative to Social Security, ridiculed as a "nutty" idea, has,   
thanks to Steve Forbes, become a mainstream economic issue.   
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Steve Forbes will find similar vindication.  Although widely dismissed   
as an iconoclastic, unimportant candidate, many of his ideas - like   
the  flat tax that Bob Dole is already moving toward endorsing - will   
be around for a long time to come   
  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
 
Although the flat tax was Forbes' most visible idea, it was  not his   
only idea.  He also spoke eloquently about the need to make the dollar   
as good as gold,  about ending political careerism with term limits,   
and about  privatizing Social Security.  Indeed, the very fact that he   
was not vilified for suggesting the latter idea, as Barry Goldwater    
was, may be the most important development of the 1996 campaign.  As   
Sherlock Holmes once observed, the significant event was the dog that   
didn't bark.   
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Social Security has long been known as the "third rail" of  American   
politics because every politician who ever suggested  privatization   
suffered the same fate as those who touch the  electrified third rail   
of a subway.  But times are changing.  Because of demographics there   
are fewer people every year who get a good deal out of Social Security   
and more  who have little expectation of receiving anything.  As a   
result,  even the American Association of Retired Persons is said to   
be  sympathetic to some option that would allow younger workers to set   
aside some of their payroll taxes in a private savings account.  The   
Social Security Advisory Council is expected to make a similar   
recommendation in a few weeks.   
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Steve Forbes may never run for president again and his run  this year   
may never warrant more than a footnote in history, but if Bob Dole -   
or even Bill Clinton - proposes a flat tax next year, or if  Congress   
moves toward some kind of private alternative to Social  Security,   
Forbes will deserve some of the credit.  For if nothing  else, his was   
a campaign about ideas.     
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

And as Ronald Reagan reminded us, ideas have consequences.

<h2>   
The Popcorn Follies   
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/
dupont
.html">
Pete du Pont 
</a>
<p>
Popcorn is not a trivial matter.  I am reminded of that at the movies 
where buttered buckets of the stuff are consumed and the surplus 
spread on the floor under my seat. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
But I did not realize the popcorn problem is so severe that a deficit-
bedeviled federal government must shoulder yet another burden to 
protect its citizens.  On April 4th, when President Clinton signed the 
"Freedom to Farm Act," it became the legal responsibility of our 
national government "to ensure the benefits of popcorn are available 
to the people of the United States" by "strengthen[ing] the position 
of the popcorn industry in the marketplace."  Awesome. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
And all this in a bill heralded as a revolutionary step towards the 
deregulation of agriculture, the ending of farm subsidies, and "the 
most sweeping change in agricultural policy in the last 60 years." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
A more appropriate title for this bill might be "The Slightly More 
Flexible Reform Act."  Its reforms are more illusory than real, and 
less permanent than might be expected.  And popcorn is the least of 
its follies. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What changes under the new farm law?  Most notably, for the first time 
there will be a cap on farm spending.  The law replaces traditional 
subsidy payments with a fixed but declining level of transition 
payments to farmers ($36 billion over seven years).  It also ends 
federal authority to hold farm land out of production.  However, at 
the end of seven years, unless Congress acts, the old farm policies 
(subsidy payments and land set-asides) automatically come back into 
effect. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What of the so-called "freedom" under the reform bill?  The act was 
promoted as allowing farmers the freedom to plant whatever crop was 
most likely to produce the highest profit.  This would seem to mean 
that, if world market prices for wheat were low but prices for 
tomatoes were high, then wheat farmers might switch to producing 
tomatoes.  Not so.  A farmer now growing subsidized crops can only 
switch to another subsidized crop - essentially other grains, cotton 
or rice. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What doesn't change under the new farm bill?  A lot.  American 
consumers will continue to pay higher prices than the rest of the 
world's citizens for sugar, peanuts, and most dairy products, because 
these crops will continue to get subsidies amounting to more then $2 
billion a year.  Soybean subsidies will actually increase.  Americans 
will also continue to foot the bill for the Market Promotion Program, 
which helps promote U.S. agricultural products overseas - including, 
henceforth, popcorn.  Landowners don't get those regulatory exemptions 
promised for temporary wetlands under one acre in size.  Farmers and 
ranchers will continue to have to bear the entire financial burden of 
the general public's desire for no net loss of mud puddles. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
The farm bill is also surprising because of the new bureaucracies that 
it creates.  There's a new "National Natural Resources Conservation 
Foundation" to promote the conservation of natural resources on 
private lands, in part through education grants to nonprofit 
organizations.  The nation's top 10 environmental organizations 
already receive more than $500 million a year in grants and donations, 
so they are more than capable of promoting their viewpoint without any 
help from taxpayers. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
Also, a new food safety panel is created, adding one more layer of 
bureaucracy to the Department of Agriculture.  Both consumer groups 
and members of the meat and poultry industries have criticized this 
program.  Following tried and true Washington logic, if neither 
industry nor consumers like a program, it must be good. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
These new programs might surprise people who thought the Republican 
promises to "get government off the backs of people" and presidential 
statements that the "era of big government is over" would mean a 
reduction in the number of federal programs and bureaucracies, not the 
creation of new ones. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
The most perverse part of the new farm bill calls for spending $300 
million to acquire about 100,000 acres of the Florida Everglades.  
Protecting the Everglades may be in the public interest, but the 
simplest way of conserving the Everglades would be to end the sugar 
subsidy that allows inefficient sugar producers to continue to operate 
in the fragile Everglades ecosystem.  Then we could save the money and 
the Everglades.  But sugar subsidies do not seem to be a part of the 
era of big government that President Clinton assures us is over. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
Like the monsters in Hollywood movies, big government just keeps 
coming back.  So on Saturday night, enjoy "Braveheart's" anguished cry 
for freedom, knowing that Washington now has its hand in your bag of 
popcorn.   
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
Or if that strikes you as sensible, turn to Section 551 of the Freedom 
to Farm Act.  It creates the "National Kiwifruit Research, Promotion, 
and Consumer Information Act." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<h2>A New Medicare: <br>A Better Deal for the Elderly
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>








<P>

<P>




<P>
Medicare, the government health care program for older 
Americans, currently serves 32 million people and costs about $180 
billion a year.  Medicare recipients pay $19 billion in premiums and the 
rest comes from a federal payroll tax.
<P>
Often the health care provided isn't very good. One reason is that 
the government pays doctors and hospitals providing the care only about 
70% of its cost, so doctors don't want to serve Medicare patients. As a 
result, there are longer waits for care, and sometimes a lack of care. So 
health care is being rationed to some of the elderly.
<P>
The quality of care may be lower, too, since hospitals and doctors 
are paid the same fee regardless of the quality of care provided.  For 
example, if a doctor is paid a fixed amount to implant a pacemaker, why 
not implant the cheapest one available and pocket the difference?
<P> 
 Finally, new medical technology is slow to be approved by the 
Medicare bureaucracy, so the elderly often get "old medicine."
<P>
 Even with all these efforts to limit costs, Medicare is proving to 
be very, very expensive.  According to the Clinton administration and 
Medicare Trustees, Medicare as it now operates will run out of money in 
less than seven years.
<P>
  By 2000, under current budget projections, Medicare will spend 
almost $250 billion, about 13% of the entire federal budget.  The deficit 
in Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) and the general revenue 
contribution to Medicare Part B (insurance for physicians' fees and other 
expenses) will be adding almost $150 billion to the total federal deficit.  
<P>
 Financial problems will quickly grow worse after that.  By the 
time those entering the workforce today retire, the Medicare payroll tax 
will need to be three to seven times higher than now.  The annual 
premiums paid by the elderly will be about $4,400 to $8,600 per couple 
instead of today's $1,000.
<P>	
 It doesn't have to be that way.  One simple and popular reform 
proposal offers a solution:  allowing the elderly the choice of substituting 
a Medical Savings Account and private insurance for their current 
Medicare coverage.
<P>
 Under one version of this proposal, Medicare beneficiaries 
would have the right to receive 95% of average Medicare spending per 
beneficiary and put it into a Medical Savings Account (MSA).  Retirees 
could also contribute the funds they must currently pay for Medicare 
premiums, supplemental Medigap insurance, and out-of-pocket health 
expenses.
<P>
  For the average retiree, these would total close to $9,000 next 
year.  The retiree would use part of these funds to purchase catastrophic 
insurance covering all expenses over a high deductible (say $2,000 or 
$3,000).  The retiree would have at least $2,000-$3,000 remaining in the 
account, which would then be used to pay expenses below the deductible, 
including HMO or other private health care insurance coverage if they 
prefer.  Any unspent MSA funds could then be withdrawn at the end of 
the year for any purpose, or saved for future medical expenses.
<P>
 With MSAs, the quality of elderly health care would quickly 
begin to improve.   Patients would be free to choose the doctors and 
hospitals that would provide the quality health care they prefer.  The 
elderly who exercised the MSAs would also have complete catastrophic 
coverage, which Medicare does not provide.  Medicare coverage runs out 
after a certain number of days of hospital care, and other benefits are 
similarly limited.  But with an MSA, the elderly can buy a catastrophic 
policy that pays all costs over their chosen deductible.
<P>
 Most important, since people would effectively be spending 
their own funds out of the MSAs for non-catastrophic health care, they 
would have excellent incentives to eliminate waste and inefficiency and 
control their own costs.  Since doctors and hospitals would be receiving 
100% payment for their services instead of 70% under today's Medicare, 
they in turn would compete to reduce costs to attract elderly patients 
trying to conserve their MSA funds.  The result would be lower costs for 
Medicare.
<P>
 Several private sector employers have already adopted MSAs 
for their workers and achieved dramatic cost savings of 30%-40% and 
more as a result.  To the extent Medicare beneficiaries chose MSAs, 
much of this cost savings would likely be achieved for Medicare as well.  
This would greatly help to reduce the burden of Medicare on the federal 
budget and its contribution to the overall deficit.  It would also help to 
solve the long term Medicare financing crisis. And since the individual 
gets 95% of average Medicare spending, the government saves an 
additional 5%, or more than $5 billion per year.	
<P>
  This proposal provides overwhelming benefits to the elderly, 
and would be enormously popular.  Yet, all of this can be achieved while 
actually saving the government substantial funds, and helping to solve the 
program's long term financing crisis.  Such a combination of advantages 
should be irresistible to policymakers.

<h2>V-E Day Reflections
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>










 <P>
 





Omaha Beach Cemetery, V-E Day - Beneath a clear blue sky and endless 
rows of white marble crosses lie ten thousand of the boys who set out 
to win the war. 
 <P>
They fought their way onto the continent on D-Day, and then across it 
to the Rhine and victory.  They secured the beaches and the peace for 
us, giving up their chance to live life into their old age.  On V-E 
Day, 1945, a million cheering Brits gave thanks for their bravery, 
joining  hands to sing God Save the Queen to Winston Churchill and 
Queen Elizabeth, who stood on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. 
 <P>
For millions of people, though, V-E Day was not the end of anything.  
For Poles and Czechs and Eastern Europeans, it was neither the end, 
nor even the beginning of the end, of tyranny.  It was only the 
beginning of Stalin's occupation now that Hitler's was finished.  And 
this more brutal oppression would last 44 years instead of six. 
 <P>
Oscar Lindner, an Estonian refugee, survived both.  "The only 
difference between the Germans and the Russians," he explains, "was 
that Nazis come for people during the day; Communists deport people in 
the middle of the night." 
 <P>
How ironic it is that President Clinton was neither in England nor 
France on V-E Day, but in Moscow.  The Russians, of course, have much 
to celebrate 50 years after the end of their Great Patriotic War, from 
survival of the 900 day siege of Leningrad, to the hand-to-hand battle 
in the factories and sewers of Stalingrad, which won the war and saved 
the Motherland.  But they have just as much to atone for:  the 
massacre at Katyn of the Polish officer corps, the enslavement of half 
of Europe and the crushing of freedom in Hungary in 1956 and 
Czechoslovakia in 1968. 
 <P>
So V-E Day was not the end of the anguish.  The horror of Auschwitz 
was yet to be comprehended and some 40 years of communist oppression 
lay ahead. 
 <P>
But the end of European combat began to lift an enormous weight from 
minds and hearts of Americans.  Even for those too young to fight (I 
was 10 on V-E Day), the relief was real, for the war had been with us 
for most of our young lives.   
 <P>
War bulletins, ration coupons and black-out curtains had punctuated 
our days.  Around our supper table we learned about Pearl Harbor, U-
boats, D-Day and the Seigfreid Line.  My uncle, a private in 
Eisenhower's army, was somewhere in Europe.  But where?  Near a place 
called Bastogne, it turned out, where he grabbed a butcher's cleaver 
(which he fortunately never had to use) as he turned out to meet the 
Germans pouring through the Bulge. 
 <P>
Our understanding was sharpened by the media as well, by the movies, 
newsreels, and radio.  Ingrid Bergman in the swirling mists of 
Casablanca taught us devotion to a cause; so did John Wayne in fighter 
planes and foxholes.  The endless parade of Nazi officers assuring us 
they had ways of making us talk impressed our young minds with the 
terror of the police state, while Pathe News showed us Kamikaze 
fanaticism.  Over the BBC, Winston Churchill and the Battle of Britain 
inspired us:  "never have so many owed so much to so few...this was 
their finest hour!"  Vera Lynn's haunting "I'll be seeing you..." 
reminded us that sometimes the ending would not be happy, and The Best 
Years of Our Lives brought home all the tragedies of war.  
 <P>
World War II had taught us two lasting lessons:  through effort, good 
could triumph over evil, and that our entire nation could unite to 
meet a challenge.  We shared a common determination -- "the war 
effort" --  and a clear understanding of what evil was. 
 <P>
The final lesson is how quickly that clarity faded.  The further the 
war slips from memory, the more blurred our distinction between good 
and evil has become.  In 1945, no one was for the Nazis.  By 1950,  
lots of people questioned whether South Korea even mattered.  And by 
the time of Vietnam, Jane Fonda, our universities, and our media were 
on the other side.  The tyranny of the left became acceptable only 
twenty years after we had fought a great war to destroy tyrannies of 
the right. 
 <P>
The boys buried above the cliffs of Omaha Beach would never have 
understood that.  Their cause was to free the world from the evil of 
oppression.  Its clarity is engraved in the stone of their Memorial 
Chapel:   "Remember the glory of their spirit." 
 <P>
Remember, too, that in their glory they each gave up the chance to be 
what we are today. 
 
<P>

<h2>Crimson Tide and SDI
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>









 <P>
 






Crimson Tide is a sizzling movie, two hours of high tech, high tension 
confrontation wrapped around a post-Cold War terrorist scenario.  The 
film's tension is created by the need to fire a pre-emptive strike 
from a U. S. submarine in time to destroy rogue Russian missiles being 
fueled for an imminent launch.  But the real drama lies in the issues 
raised about America's security in the post-Cold War era.  
 
The film is fiction, so it doesn't bother to tell us that destruction 
on the launch pad is the only way to kill the Russian nukes.  But in 
the real world it's true:  once a missile is launched, the United 
States is unable to shoot it down.  We can pray for our family or 
friends who in a few minutes will be incinerated.  But we must suffer 
the missile's impact on Washington, Los Angeles, or wherever, because 
we have not built a missile defense system to protect us against 
incoming ICBMs. 
 <P>
We have the technology to build one.  A decade of Strategic Defense 
Initiative (SDI) research has developed the Patriot anti-missile 
missile, for example.  As we saw in the Middle East, the Patriot gives 
us the ability to protect small regions of civilians and soldiers from 
missile attack.  Further, our shipboard AEGIS missile system is a 
workable defender of our naval fleet. 
 <P>
What we lack is the will.  For years, the Congress has gutted funding 
for SDI research and national missile defense, until today's funding 
levels are less than one-third of a decade ago.  Now the Clinton 
administration is negotiating with the shadow of the former Soviet 
Union to be sure we never build a national missile defense. 
 <P>
So we sleep defenseless against a single terrorist missile.  Think for 
a moment about a rogue band of international terrorists operating in 
some remote corner of  Iran -- or Iraq, or in the mountains of North 
Korea, or in the Crimson Tide scenario in rebel Russia on the 
Kamchatka Peninsula.  How does the United States respond if such a 
group were to launch a missile towards our country?  We could, of 
course, retaliate and obliterate their nation, killing millions of 
innocent people.  But what do terrorists care about that?  How much of 
a deterrent would that be to a band of kamikaze extremists willing to 
destroy an American city? 
 <P>
Over a decade ago, when the idea of SDI was first proposed by the 
Reagan Administration, it was derided by liberals as a science fiction 
fantasy, an expensive and impractical dream.  Democratic Congresses 
and weak Presidents bought that argument, so today we have no missile 
defense. 
 <P>
Indeed, our nation has no better means of protecting its people today 
than it did back in the fifties and sixties, the days when American 
school children practiced hiding under their desks during air raid 
drills.  That is inexcusable.  The only reason there is not more of an 
outcry demanding construction of an anti-missile defense shield is 
because many people think it already exists.  In a survey conducted by 
the Coalition to Defend America, almost 60% of the respondents thought 
the "U.S. could destroy a ballistic missile" before it "could hit and 
do damage."  When the respondents were told no such capability exists, 
over 75% said they thought deployment of such a capability should be a 
priority for our nation. 
 <P>
It would not be an expensive priority.  A recent study conducted for 
the Heritage Foundation by former civilian and government military 
experts concluded that for just $2-3 billion over the next five years, 
our nation could adapt existing AEGIS technology to provide an 
effective missile defense for our nation. 
 <P>
As former President Ronald Reagan said in 1993, ten years after he 
launched our nation's SDI effort, "now more than ever, it is vital 
that the United States not back down from its efforts to develop and 
deploy strategic defenses.  It is technologically feasible, 
strategically necessary and morally imperative."  Frank Gaffney, Jr., 
the former Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Reagan Administration 
and currently head of The Center for Security Policy, notes the lack 
of such defenses is "our people's most serious strategic 
vulnerability." 
 <P>
For those who have not yet seen Crimson Tide, I won't give away the 
ending.  But, if  we ever do find a half-a-dozen ICBMs streaking 
towards America, we know our nation would be defenseless against them.  
That's a sad ending.  And Hollywood wouldn't even be around to film 
the sequel. 
 <P>

<h2>Washington's New 
Math
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>
<p>







A decade ago as Governor of Delaware, I was trying to persuade the legislature to enact a bill granting lower tax rates to banks that moved business operations into our state.  Some liberal legislators objected to the tax incentive, arguing that the state would be taxing banks too little and the bankers would be making too much.<p> 
 "Look," I said, "today we get zero taxes from a bank that isn't here.  If one comes, we get the taxes and all the jobs it creates.  The banks will benefit and so will the state."<p>
 A similar argument currently rages in Washington about lowering capital gains tax rates.  Cut the tax rate, the liberals argue, and the government will tax too little and the wealthy will benefit too 
much.<p>
 Remember that capital gains - the increase in value of stocks or other assets - are only taxed if the asset is sold.  Obviously, affluent people have more assets than nonaffluent people.  But like the bank 
that isn't here, if they don't sell the asset, the government doesn't realize any tax revenue.  But if the prospective tax on the capital gain is lowered, some people who otherwise would have held onto their 
asset will decide to sell it.  The seller will reap his reward and capital gains tax revenue will increase.  So both the seller and the government will benefit.<p>
 Or so you might think.  But in the make-believe world of Washington arithmetic, the government will be scored as losing money.  The reason is that Washington's revenue estimators - the "scorekeepers" you read about - use what amounts to two sets of books.  On the one hand, they agree that the government will get a certain amount of additional revenue in the short run.  But the way they calculate the amount of gain would tax anyone's patience.  If someone doesn't sell an asset because they would have had to pay $10,000 in taxes, but does sell it when the tax is reduced to $7,000, the revenue estimators consider it a $3,000 revenue loss rather than a $7,000 revenue gain.  So a tax rate reduction that results in more dollars flowing to the Treasury is said to be a revenue loss - or, as the scorekeepers put it, a "tax benefit" to the seller.  Truth is indeed stranger than fiction. <p>
 Following this line of reasoning, if a retail store with goods that cost $500,000 and were priced at $1 million sold them for $750,000, the result would be not a $250,000 profit but a $250,000 loss.  And by 
Washington arithmetic, the sale would be unfair because it benefited the customers. <p>
 That's what the liberals argue in denouncing the tax cuts enacted by the House of Representatives - they are unfair because they benefit the wealthy.  As Bruce Bartlett, the former Treasury Department 
official who is now a Senior Fellow with the NCPA, has noted, things are not quite what they seem here.  The wealthy do hold more assets - or they wouldn't be wealthy - but 74% of the taxpayers who benefit from a capital gains tax cut have incomes of less than $75,000.  Indeed, when all the tax cut provisions of the House bill have taken effect, 65% of the benefits will go to taxpayers with incomes below $75,000, even though they pay only 49% of all federal taxes.  A bonanza for the wealthy?  Not exactly.<p>
Consider another example, the "draconian budget cuts" the liberals charge the Republicans are going to make in Medicare.  Under both the House and Senate versions of the budget, Medicare spending is 
scheduled to increase - by an average of 7% in each of the next five years. <p>
So how can an increase be a drastic cut?  By the same "Washington arithmetic" that makes tax revenue increases net losses to the Treasury.<p>
 Washington arithmetic uses a strange accounting system called "current services baseline budgets."  A current services baseline budget assumes that you will keep doing everything you do now exactly the same next year, and that in addition because of inflation and increased use of Medicare, next year's costs will rise as much as this year's.  That amount then becomes the "baseline" and any spending less than the baseline is a "cut" in the budget.  So a 7% increase in Medicare spending, compared to a 12% baseline budget, comes out as a 5% spending cut. What keeps all this from being hilarious is that the people who think this way have control of huge amounts of real money - our  money.  The truth is Washington arithmetic is designed to ensure that taxes are never cut and spending is never lowered. No wonder so much of the public lacks faith in the Congress.<p>
 Even the Delaware liberals who argued against the bank bill in the 1980s now admit it was a good thing.  Bank franchise taxes yielded $3 million in revenue the year before the bill was passed.  Last year, because a great many new businesses had moved to Delaware, revenues approached $100 million. <p>
Not bad.  Of course by Washington arithmetic, Delaware suffered a $97 million loss. <p>

<title>The End of Quotas Just in Time</title>

<h2>The End of Quotas Just in Time
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>










<p>

President Clinton's  "full-throated" (Washington Post) and "near- evangelical" (New York Times) endorsement of affirmative action has set liberal hearts a flutter.
<p>
The University of California's Regents' vote to end race-based admission, hiring, and contracting set Rev. Jesse Jackson ablaze.
<p>
Over at the Judicial branch of government, cooler heads are prevailing. The U.S. Supreme Court has applied the brakes to affirmative action, questioning the constitutional validity of programs that guarantee jobs or contracts on the basis of race.  "Equal protection of the law is a personal right, not a group right," wrote Justice O'Connor.
<p>
Just in time, too, because for two decades government quotameisters have been cutting a broad swath through individual rights.
<p>
For example, the Pentagon sent out word that "special permission will be required for the promotion of all white men without disabilities."  The U.S. Forest Service, desperate to meet its goals for minority firefighters, earlier this year said in a job posting that it would only consider applicants "who do not meet standards."
<p>
Navy Secretary John Dalton has issued a policy that henceforth Naval officers will be commissioned "in a percentage approximately equal to the racial make-up of the populace."  Navy flight standards also seem to have been bent to meet quotas for women fighter pilots.
<p>
Nondiscrimination in hiring, promoting and in awarding government contracts is both right and a right.  But in practice, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has been turned on its head by those charged with enforcing it.  Instead of trying to wipe out discrimination, they have mandated it.  The legislation that Senator Hubert Humphrey assured us could never be used to impose quotas has become a quota statute.
<p>
Affirmative action has become a zero-sum game in which gains for one group can only be made at the expense of other groups.  Setting aside a construction contract for one minority group takes opportunity away from others.  When the University of California at Berkeley sets different admission standards for Asian-American students (the policy the Regents just voted down) because too large a percentage of them would be admitted if only grades and test scores were used, Asians are disadvantaged and blacks gain.
<p>
Quotas also undermine the very minorities they are supposed to help.  In a recent issue of The New Democrat, Carol M. Swain, a black professor of politics and public policy at Princeton University, blamed affirmative action for promoting a "helpless victim" mentality that undermines self- respect and initiative.  She wrote:  "It says in effect that you, as a woman or minority, are less capable than a white male and will need special preference in order to compete successfully in a world dominated by white males."
<p>
As a result, a black or Hispanic or woman who is hired or is promoted to a position of responsibility has to overcome the suspicion on the part of others that he or she wouldn't be there except for a quota.  The resulting self-doubt can become an additional handicap in achieving success.
<p>
Justice Clarence Thomas, addressing school busing in the Kansas City desegregation case, was blunt:  "It never ceases to amaze me that the courts are so willing to assume that anything that is predominantly black must be inferior.  This position [that racial imbalances are unconstitutional] appears to rest upon the idea that any school that is black is inferior, and that blacks cannot succeed without the benefit of the company of whites."
<p>
Quotas are also an easy way out.  Quotameisters just calculate that the local population is 12% black, 7% Hispanic and 1% Asian-American, and demand that the makeup of everybody's workforce reflect those percentages.  Then businesses don't have to worry about searching for talented people, or recruiting them, or looking for human potential and helping to develop it.  That takes work.  It's much easier just to hire by the numbers.
<p>
Thus we have incidents like the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's Chicago office spending seven years unsuccessfully  suing a Korean-owned janitorial service because more than 5% of its workforce was Korean and 95% of the Chicago labor pool was not.
<p>
Trying to end racial or sexual discrimination by giving preferences to one group at the expense of another is like trying to level a table.  If you cut too much off one leg, you have to cut off the others to even things out. And if you make a mistake, you can always trim a little more here or there.  But soon the table is useless.
<p>
So far, there is no indication that the government is going after National Basketball Association teams because they have such a high percentage of black (or tall) players.  Nor does anyone seem to be investigating why seven of the ten best lifetime batting averages of all time belong to left- handed hitters.  Maybe Justice O'Connor spoke just in time.

<h2>A Program in Need of a Crisis
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>










<p>
<p>
When the politicians in Washington suddenly discover a new issue, do you ever wonder about the facts?  You should, because sometimes the facts contradict what the politicians are saying.
<p>
Remember "Alar"?  It turned out there was no apple pesticide problem - the politicians made up the scare.
<p>
Likewise, the Congress mandated $4 billion a year in acid rain mitigation, even though the most comprehensive environmental study in history concluded there was "no evidence of a general or unusual decline of forest in the United States or Canada due to acid rain." And the problem of global warming, according to the Washington Post, "appears to be heading toward solution before [researchers] can find any solid evidence that serious harm was or is being done."
<p>
This summer saw another example of the facts contradicting the politicians:  children's vaccinations.
<p>
In 1993, right in the middle of the great health care debate when President Clinton was trying to scare everyone (with some success) into believing the country's health care system had imploded, the president proposed and the Congress passed a costly new program that would  create an elaborate new distribution system to provide vaccines free of  charge to poor children, the Vaccines for Children Program (VFC).
<p>
Never mind that about half of all childhood vaccines were already being provided free through public health clinics.  The Clintons - and I use the plural intentionally - needed to persuade people that a health care crisis had arisen.  The president pointed to a measles epidemic between 1989 and 1991 that took the lives of more than 100 children in the United States.  And he argued that the reason many children weren't vaccinated was the cost - drug companies were pursuing "profits at the expense of our children."
<p>
But the facts tell a very different story.  In May 1994, for example, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published a study of measles immunization of 2-year-olds in Mississippi during the time of the outbreak.
<p>
What did the researchers find out about this rural southern state with a large black population and below-average incomes?  First, that the statewide measles immunization rate of 2-year-olds was 87% (ranging from 79% to 97% according to the geographical district).  While 87% isn't perfect, it's far from being a crisis justifying a $500 million federal vaccination program.
<p>
Moreover, immunization rates were "similar for white and black children in each health district and for the state as a whole."  So there is no racial discrimination problem.
<p>
But what about the poor, rural population? They're the ones who have to drive the farthest to get the immunizations, so doesn't a large rural population point to the need for the president's new distribution scheme? No, because "the level of vaccine coverage was significantly higher in districts with lower population densities (i.e., rural) and those with higher per capita incomes," according to the report.
<p>
So who's left?  Lower-income people living in urban areas - those most likely to have access to public clinics where free vaccines have always been available.
<p>
But the most significant finding of the JAMA study is this:  half of those measles cases contracted during the outbreak in Mississippi "occurred in unimmunized children too young to receive the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine."  (Emphasis added)  It's pretty difficult to blame those "greedy" drug companies for the fact that many children were too young to get the vaccine.
<p>
Now, two years after the VFC's inception, comes a General Accounting Office (GAO) report finding that the VFC's newly created distribution scheme, meant to make the vaccines more accessible to poor children, is not working.   For example, 14 states were prohibited by state law from distributing free vaccines to private physicians, the software needed to process orders was defective, and the Centers for Disease Control could not ensure that the program would serve only entitled children.  Of seven  major implementation tasks considered by the GAO, six  "remained incomplete and problematic."
<p>
Most significant, the GAO found the cost of vaccines had never been a major barrier to immunizations.  A different 1994 JAMA study, done prior to the GAO report, had come to a similar conclusion.  It found that the "provision of free vaccine alone will not guarantee adequate immunization of poor urban children."
<p>
The truth is that the administration created and promoted the VFC program from political necessity rather than medical necessity.  As with his grander attempt to restructure the entire health care system, President Clinton needed to impart a crisis atmosphere, and he succeeded -- for a time, anyway.  Now that the crisis mentality and his health care plan have died, so should the VFC program.

<title>SCHOOL REFORM: WILL NEW JERSEY EVER LEARN?</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center><i>Thursday, August 17, 1995 </i>
<hr>



<h2>School Reform: Will New Jersey Ever Learn?
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>










<p>
<p>
For the third time in half a dozen years, the state of New Jersey has 
seized control of a local school district.  This time the victims are 
the 48,000 students of the Newark school system, who are about to 
receive a civics lesson they will likely never forget.  They are going 
to learn what it's like to be dumped out of the frying pan of one 
failed education bureaucracy, only to fall into the fire of another. 
<p> 
There is no question that the Newark school system deserves a failing 
grade.  Only one-fourth of its students were able to pass the 1993 
high school proficiency test on their first try.  The district's 
classrooms had fallen into disrepair.  Student attendance was poor.  A 
1994 report, prepared by the state, blasted Newark school officials 
for "dereliction of duty."  The highly critical report spoke of 
students in rat-infested schools, while administrators sat in 
"comfortable offices" and had "important-sounding titles."   
<p> 
Change was obviously needed, but why do New Jersey officials believe 
that shifting control to a larger, more distant state bureaucracy is 
the right kind of change?  They have it exactly the wrong way around:  
effective school reform involves moving decisions about educating 
students closer to the classroom, not further away.  Replacing one 
bureaucracy with another will not work. 
<p> 
New Jersey officials do not have to look very far to see that this is 
so.  In the last six years, New Jersey state education officials have 
also taken control of the schools in Jersey City and Paterson.  When 
Bret Schundler became Jersey City's Mayor in 1992, its schools had 
been under state control for three years, and they continue under 
state control today.  Mayor Schundler states he is "convinced the 
takeovers are doomed to failure and can actually make matters worse."  
He notes "there has been no innovation in Paterson, no innovation in 
Jersey City, and there will probably be none in Newark." 
 <p>
A study of the Jersey City schools, conducted last year, concluded 
that the "district remains below standard in four out of five high 
schools in writing and mathematics."  Results in the district's 
elementary schools for reading and mathematics were also 
"unacceptable."  In certain areas, performance actually deteriorated 
under state control. 
 <p>
So, if state control does not work, what does?  The answer is to give 
control to teachers and parents, so teachers can teach and parents can 
choose the teachers they want for their children. 
<p> 
Suppose that six years ago, instead of commandeering their school 
system, New Jersey had allowed the parents of Jersey City to send 
their children to the school of their choice - public or private, near 
or far?  Parents could have chosen the school best suited to each of 
their children.  Newly formed charter schools might have sprung up; 
private schools might have expanded their enrollment.  Existing public 
schools would have improved to attract more students. 
 <p>
Most important, the children of Jersey City would have immediately 
begun receiving a better education.  As it worked out, Jersey City's 
30,000 students are not receiving an education today any better than 
the one the state replaced six years ago. 
 <p>
Choice and charter schools are no longer new ideas.  They are being 
tried and evaluated across the country.  In New York, East Harlem 
District No. 4 is legendary for the significant student improvement 
that occurred when teachers and parents were empowered to design and 
choose the education approach they wanted. 
 <p>
In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, an increasing number of low-income children 
are in the fifth year of a school choice program, and test scores are 
rising, although so far only slightly.  More importantly, student 
satisfaction has improved, as has parental satisfaction and 
involvement, and not surprisingly, student attendance and discipline.  
These all contribute to a learning-friendly environment that is bound 
to increase test scores even more in the future. 
 <p>
The truth is that education bureaucracies, whether the Newark school 
board, the New Jersey Department of Education, or the U. S. Department 
of Education, are simply not customer-focused.  They act like the 
monopolies they are, focusing on what is best for them. 
 <p>
The failure of these bureaucracies should be obvious to all.  SAT 
scores have fallen precipitously over the last two decades, and the 
number of students scoring 600 and above on the Verbal SATs has 
dropped 35%.  American students rank 13th in the world on math and 
science tests.  Only 26% of the fourth graders in America can actually 
read at the fourth grade level. 
 <p>
What the education bureaucrats in New Jersey and thousands of 
education departments across the country have yet to learn is that 
time and technology have passed them by.  They are industrial-age 
dinosaurs in an information-driven society, attempting to deliver 
mass-produced education to children who need individualized attention. 
 <p>
Their educational model must be replaced with the energy and 
initiative of schools free to innovate and parents empowered to do 
what is best for each of their children.

<title>Ross Perot's Medicare Rx -- du Pont</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<center>
<i>Thursday, September 28, 1995</i><hr>
 
<h2>Ross Perot's Medicare Rx </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>
 

Ross Perot has a knack for identifying those issues that are important 
to voters.  Just a week after congressional leaders said that Medicare 
reform would be the biggest policy issue this fall, his book on 
Medicare hit the stands.  Intensive Care is a book about the crisis 
facing Medicare and Medicaid, the federal and federal/state health 
insurance programs for the elderly and poor.   <p>
 
 Medicare and Medicaid have evolved into enormous, wasteful and 
inefficient government programs that must be reformed before they 
financially break the country.   How big is the problem?  Mr. Perot 
points out that Medicare and Medicaid will take up 17.4 percent of the 
federal budget in 1995, or about 35 percent of all entitlement 
spending.  According to Medicare's board of trustees, without 
fundamental change the program will go bankrupt by 2002.   <p>
 
Something has to be done, and it has to be done soon.  But as Mr. 
Perot points out, historically Congress has been reluctant to resolve 
the federal government's penchant for excessive spending.  "Our 
elected leaders have ignored the clear signals that the greatest 
nation in the history of man has been spending itself toward 
bankruptcy."  <p>
 
Medicare is probably the only large health insurance plan in the 
country that has not undergone fundamental change over the past 
decade.  Many employers have increased deductibles and copayments - 
requiring employees to manage more of their own health care dollars.  
More frequently, employers have begun directing their employees to 
lower-cost doctors and actively managing health care costs.   <p>
 
Medicare has moved in the opposite direction.  In recent years the 
deductible for Part A (hospital insurance) has not changed in real 
terms, and the deductible for Part B (other medical expenses) has 
actually decreased in real terms.  While there has been some 
experimentation with managed care, in most places Medicare is still a 
wide-open, fee-for-service plan in which patients can see almost any 
doctor for any service.   
 
Reforming Medicare and Medicaid and balancing the federal budget will 
force us to make some tough choices, and when there are tough choices 
to be made Ross Perot hears his entry cue.  He believes that "we 
should view the coming debate over Medicare and Medicaid as an 
opportunity rather than a dilemma."  It's an "opportunity for creative 
minds to update old systems that have served their purpose, but are 
now in need of an overhaul to function properly in the next century." <p>
 
What direction should reform take?  "A properly designed system based 
on market principles will do more to initiate positive change than any 
government rules and regulations that attempt to monitor the profits 
of the health care industry," Mr. Perot tells us.  <p>
 
As mentioned earlier, many employers are actively managing their 
employees' health care costs or are moving them into managed care 
plans.  Mr. Perot discusses this solution and points out that Congress 
is already moving in this direction for Medicare.  Current law allows 
some Medicare beneficiaries to withdraw from Medicare and join a 
health maintenance organization (HMO) instead.  While seniors should 
be free to remain in Medicare, we should build on this precedent and 
allow Medicare beneficiaries to withdraw from Medicare Parts A and B 
and choose any alternative private plan.   <p>
 
Perhaps a more attractive option than managed care is also discussed 
by Mr. Perot:  Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs). This option would 
permit Medicare recipients to use their Medicare funds to purchase a 
catastrophic policy coupled with a Medical Savings Account.  For 
example, private insurance might cover all health expenses over a 
$3,000 deductible, and place any premium savings in an MSA.  MSA funds 
would then be used to pay for expenses below $3,000.  In case a gap 
remained between the MSA deposit and the catastrophic deductible, 
retirees could top up their MSA by contributing amounts they otherwise 
would have used to purchase private, Medigap insurance or pay out-of-
pocket expenses.  <p>
 
Of course, to hear Democrats and liberals complain about MSAs, you'd 
think it was positively un-American to let people keep some of the 
money they are now giving to insurance companies.  It's that same 
mentality we've seen from Washington for years: "Heaven help us if we 
let taxpayers keep some of their own money.  They might not spend it 
like we bureaucrats would like." <p>
 
Ross Perot has always believed in the ability of the American people 
to respond properly when adequately informed - and that's what this 
book is meant to do.   While his book will not be the last word on 
Medicare, Intensive Care has succeeded as a sound analytical 
beginning. <p>

<title>The Medicare Reform Plan: A Good Deal For The Elderly -- du Pont</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<center><i>Thursday, October 4, 1995</i><hr>
<h2>The Medicare Reform Plan: A Good Deal For The Elderly </h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>
 

 
The House Republicans have proposed a major revision to Medicare that, if enacted, will provide greatly improved health care for America's senior citizens.   <p>
 
The proposal accomplishes this by shifting power and control over Medicare and its funds away from the government, the hospitals, and the doctors to the elderly themselves.  As a result of this power to the people approach, the elderly will now enjoy the same freedom others have to choose a broad range of private health care plans instead of being forced to participate in the government Medicare system.    <p>
 
Under the House Republicans' plan, the elderly would each have the freedom to take their share of funds out of Medicare and use it to buy any of the full range of private alternatives for their health coverage.  HMOs or managed care will be one option; others  include Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs), traditional fee-for-service insurers, preferred provider networks, provider service networks (where doctors and hospitals in an area organize to provide health coverage directly), and plans offered by associations such as AARP, or unions, or employers.  The elderly would each be perfectly free to stay in the current Medicare system if they prefer, foregoing the private options entirely. <p>
 
The amounts that can be withdrawn from Medicare for these private 
options would average about $5,000 per year to start and would be 
allowed to grow no faster than specified in the federal budget.  <p>
 
Both experience and actuarial studies show that for these amounts many 
plans can provide better benefits than Medicare.  For example, 
Milliman & Robertson, the nation's top actuarial firm, recently 
completed a study for the National Center for Policy Analysis in 
Dallas showing that with these funds retirees could buy an MSA with 
full fee-for-service insurance covering all expenses over $3,000 per 
year, with $1,500 left in the MSA to pay for expenses below the 
deductible.  Or they could buy an MSA that provides managed care for 
all expenses over $3,000, with $2,100 left in the MSA. <p>
 
Such MSA plans would provide better benefits than Medicare in at least 
five ways: <p>
 
First, the MSA provides complete catastrophic coverage for all 
expenses over $3,000, while Medicare does not.  Medicare coverage runs 
out after various caps and limitations. <p>
 
Second, the fee-for-service MSA provides a cap on out-of-pocket 
spending for covered medical expenses of $1,500 per year (the 
difference between the $3,000 deductible and the $1,500 in the MSA) or 
$900 if the managed care option is chosen.  Medicare has no cap on 
out-of-pocket expenses; the elderly can be liable for  thousands of 
dollars in medical expenses. That is why 70% of the elderly will pay 
almost $1,200 next year on average for private insurance to supplement 
Medicare.  With the MSA, the elderly can keep that $1,200 per year or 
use it to reduce out-of-pocket medical expenses. <p>
 
Third, the funds in the MSA can be used for health care expenses not 
covered by Medicare, such as prescription drugs or eyeglasses. <p>
 
Fourth, unspent funds in the MSA at the end of the year would belong 
to the retiree, and could be saved for future expenses, or withdrawn 
for any purpose, subject to certain minimum balance requirements in 
the House Republicans' bill.  This allows the elderly to share 
directly in the reward for controlling health costs. <p>
 
Finally, MSAs would not be subject to the payment and reimbursement 
limitations of Medicare, or the outdated limitations on what new 
services and treatments the program covers.  These limitations and 
controls are reducing access to care and quality of care under 
Medicare, effectively rationing health care for the elderly. <p>
 
HMOs and other managed care options will be able to provide better 
benefits than Medicare as well.  They will likely add catastrophic 
coverage and prescription drugs to the package offered to the elderly 
for the funds they can withdraw from Medicare each year. <p>
 
Furthermore, the House Republicans' proposal does not increase costs 
appreciably for most older Americans.  There is no increase in 
Medicare deductibles and co-payments, and Medicare premiums (except 
for the very wealthiest Americans) would actually remain at their 
current level of about 31% of the costs of Part B. <p>
 
Best of all, the House Republicans' reform plan actually increases the 
freedom of the elderly to choose their own doctors.  Since private 
plan doctors would not be subject to the Medicare payment limitations, 
doctors  would not be discouraged from providing services to the 
elderly, and so there would be a wider choice of physicians.  <p>
 
Millions of elderly Americans are worried about the future of 
Medicare.  This new approach not only lays those fears to rest, it 
opens vast new health care options for all senior citizens.<p>

<title>du Pont--REPUBLICAN BAD NEWS BEARS ARE ON THE PROWL </title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2>Republican Bad News Bears Are On The Prowl </h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>
  
 

 
 
My grandmother told me that bad news comes in threes.  Over a 
lifetime, I've concluded that she was right.  This especially came to 
mind last week, as I read in the papers three pieces of bad news that 
could torpedo the Gingrich Republican revolution of 1994. 
                       <P>
First item - Senator Trent Lott (R-Miss.) seems to have slipped a new 
subsidy for the maritime industry into an appropriations bill.  It's 
only $46 million - what difference can that make to a $1.58 trillion 
government?  But it continues one of those catastrophic subsidy 
concepts that has so characterized liberal thinking for the last 50 
years. 
             <P>
The idea that the government can somehow hold back the tide of 
competition in international shipping has been liberal dogma for 
decades.  There is the Jones Act, for example, which according to our 
International Trade Commission, costs the taxpayers $10 billion a 
year.  The Maritime Operating Differential Subsidy, according to the 
General Accounting Office, costs hundreds of millions more.  And all 
the while America's merchant fleet is dwindling, priced out of the 
market by the very subsidies that are supposed to be rescuing it. 
                                                                                   <P>
Even President Clinton once proposed that the subsidies  be ended.  So 
did Vice President Gore, in a study that said their elimination could 
"spur the country's economic growth by $3 billion annually." 
                                                                         <P>
Well, they may have been kidding.  But we didn't think the 
conservative Republicans were.  
                                                             <P>
Second, I'm struck by the similarity of another Republican effort - 
this time led by the senior governor in America, Republican Terry 
Branstad of Iowa.  Using the wiles and power of the Republican 
constituency of farm belt America, Governor Branstad evidently 
persuaded the leaders of the smaller government revolution to 
reinstate a $1.8 billion (over seven years) subsidy to the ethanol 
industry. 
                                                 <P>
The House Ways and Means Committee had proposed reducing the ethanol 
tax exemption from 54 cents a gallon to (gasp!) 51 cents.  Governor 
Branstad proclaimed Iowa's future imperiled!  The ethanol industry 
will be destroyed, said the lobbyists. 
                                      <P>
I saw how smoothly Governor Branstad sweet-talked the Congresspeople, 
and how quickly they bought the argument that a 6% decrease in a 
single subsidy could destroy the nation's 28th largest state with a 
$56 billion economy.  Then the alacrity with which the Republican 
leadership caved on the issue made me wonder whether the Republican 
Revolution of 1994 could ever succeed. 
                       <P>
If America's third party -- the Gingrich conservatives elected in the 
sweep of 1994 -- as contrasted with the Senate Republicans and the 
liberal Democrats -- was in favor of this enormous and unnecessary 
subsidy, who would ever be for eliminating it?    
       <P>
Then, as if to round out my grandmother's truism, there was an article 
that a group of  Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee were 
turning into marshmallows on the subject of tax cuts.  The word is 
that they want to cut taxes a lot less than $245 billion over seven 
years because they have lost their nerve about the spending cuts that 
would be needed to balance the budget.  Never mind that the Senate had 
negotiated the House down from $345 billion in tax cuts and then 
agreed to the $245 number.  These Republican Senators now wanted to 
renege. 
      <P>
The backsliders - John Chafee of Rhode Island, Orrin Hatch of Utah, 
Alan Simpson of Wyoming, Larry Pressler of South Dakota and Alfonse 
D'Amato of New York - prowled the Senate like Republican bad news 
bears.  They appear to have been seized by Beltway madness,  the 
insidious affliction that has driven federal spending up more than 31% 
in real terms since 1981.  These Senators have evidently decided that 
it's politically easier for them to let the government keep on 
spending than it is to let Americans keep their own money.  The 
liberal Democrats seem to have found some unexpected allies. 
                                               <P>
For the moment, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader 
Bob Dole seem to have threatened the recalcitrant six into line - a 
line that will probably hold through Senate Finance Committee votes.  
But many opportunities to undermine the tax cuts of 1995 remain - in 
floor amendments, the conference with the House, and final passage 
under threat of a Clinton veto. 
                               <P>
I should be optimistic, but I can't shake my grandmother's wisdom:  
bad things do come in threes.  First, more maritime subsidies.  Then 
more ethanol subsidies.  And, finally, the same old "keep on spending, 
business as usual" syndrome.  And all approved by the very 
conservatives we put into power to clean up the mess. 
<P> 
If, as some polls suggest, the new Congress is slipping from favor 
with the general public, could it be because the general public sees 
too much of the old business as usual in the Capitol? 
           <P>

<title>du Pont--HELPING THE POOR:  WASHINGTON WELFARE FOR PRIVATE CHARITIES </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2>Helping the Poor:  Washington Welfare for Private Charities</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
   
  
What would you think of a doctor who prescribed the same treatment to  
every sick person he treated, whether the patient had a cold or lung  
cancer?  Yet, isn't that the way we handle welfare today?  The fourth- 
generation welfare mother, the educated person temporarily on hard  
times, the drug addict, the man who is simply incapable of holding a  
job - they're all treated pretty much the same by federal welfare  
policy. 
<p> 
But they aren't the same.  They're more than case numbers; they are  
people,  individuals.  Not surprisingly, a comprehensive study by Mary  
Jo Bane and David Ellwood of Harvard University found that poor people  
are just as diverse as nonpoor people.  They have diverse reasons for  
being poor and respond to diverse incentives. 
 <p>
So just as in medicine, the better the provider knows the recipient,  
the more likely that welfare funds will be spent in a way that  
benefits both the individual and the community.  Giving block grants  
to the states to handle their own welfare programs is a step in the  
right direction, but it only transfers welfare responsibility from a  
federal bureaucrat to a state bureaucrat.  A much more fundamental  
change is needed.  We must break free of the idea that only government  
- at whatever level, federal, state or local - holds the answer to  
social problems.  Generally it's not so.  It certainly isn't so in the  
case of welfare. 
 <p>
Thirty years of experience and scholarly studies confirm that the  
current welfare system discourages work and encourages dependency,  
single motherhood and the breakup of families.  People may complain  
about the monetary cost, but the real cost is the social and   
psychological cost in lives damaged or destroyed, children deprived of  
opportunity, increased crime and violence, and the creation of a  
permanent underclass of people with no hope.   
 <p>
Where welfare is concerned, there is already a better answer than  
government programs.  There is mounting evidence that private  
charities do a better job of getting aid to those who need it most,  
encouraging self-sufficiency and self-reliance, strengthening the  
family unit, and using resources efficiently. 
 <p>
Private charitable efforts are not insignificant:   In 1991, private  
charities provided more than $100 billion in cash and $76 billion in  
volunteered time for health, education, and welfare.   
 <p>
The best private charities believe that most people can and should  
support themselves and their families.  They tailor aid accordingly.   
They get aid to those who need it most and provide help without  
encouraging dependency.  They encourage or require aid recipients to  
contribute labor to the charity itself.  One might say private  
charities take just the opposite approach from government welfare:   
whereas it often takes a long time to get on government welfare rolls,  
it is easy to stay on.  Conversely, it is easy to get aid from a  
private charity, but hard to keep getting it. 
 <p>
Government programs spent about $350 billion on means-tested welfare  
programs last year - the federal share being about $240 billion.   
Instead of talking about reducing welfare spending, why not channel  
these funds to the private charities or local government programs that  
do the best job of helping the poor?  Instead of sending these  
billions to Washington, let each taxpayer decide which anti-poverty  
effort to support.  Here's one way this could work: 
 <p>
Create a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for individual contributions to  
anti-poverty programs operated either by state or local governments or  
by private sector charities.  That is, for every dollar individuals  
give to such programs, up to say $3,000 - which is about what the  
median household now pays in federal income taxes - they could take a  
dollar off their tax bills.  One estimate is that this could move a  
large portion of the $240 billion the federal government is spending  
now to private charities and state and local governments. 
 <p>
Only one person in three believes they get good value for tax dollars  
spent on social welfare programs.  But three out of four contributors  
to private charities feel their contributions are put to good use.   
So, almost everybody who pays income tax would actively think about  
the best way to provide charitable services to needy people, and would  
be likely to pay close attention to how the private charity - or the  
local or state government if that's what that taxpayer chose - is  
using the money.  After all, the poverty programs would now be run by  
people in your own home town. 
 <p>
It was early in this century when doctors first understood enough  
about medicine to begin customizing medical treatment to fit the  
patient's needs.  It would be fitting if we could end the century with  
the same kind of progress in welfare for the poor.

<h2>Public School Choice and Racial Balance</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html">Pete du Pont</a>
</center> <P>
 <hr><p>
If you thought the Congressional elections of 1994 marked the end of 
liberalism and a new era of conservative government, look at what the 
education establishment is doing to school choice back home.  A 
current example comes from Delaware, where the State Board of 
Education has blunted a new public school choice law by insisting it 
comply with racial quotas.   
 <p>
In Delaware, all the traditional school improvements advocated by the 
education establishment and the teachers unions have been tried:  
smaller classes, higher teachers salaries, earlier education and, of 
course, spending more money.  Meanwhile, SAT scores have dropped 19 
points in 10 years, the National Assessment of Educational Progress 
test scores for math showed Delaware students 28th in the nation, and 
the state now has the highest percentage in the nation (20%) of 
students attending private schools. 
 <p>
But suddenly last summer two events created a surge of hope for 
Delaware parents.  Governor Thomas R. Carper signed a public school 
choice bill in July and a few weeks later Federal District Court Judge 
Sue L. Robinson lifted the controversial busing order that for 17 
years had decreed that a school's racial balance was more important 
than excellence, student achievement, or the individual needs of a 
child. 
 <p>
Now parents would be able to choose the public school (space 
permitting) their children would attend in September, 1996.  Freedom, 
opportunity and optimism were in the summer air. 
 <p>
But it was a false dawn.  On October 19th, just 66 days after Judge 
Robinson lifted the busing order, the empire struck back.  The State 
Board of Education and its top management strongly endorsed local 
school district policies subjugating school choice to racial quotas. 
 <p>
The "new freedom and opportunity" provided by choice, said State Board 
President Paul R. Fine, "must not be at the cost of diversity in our 
public schools."  Read that again, slowly.  Individual freedom and 
educational opportunity are subservient to something called 
"diversity," as defined by state government. 
 <p>
Such policies are the core of welfare state liberalism:  the 
government will decide just how much freedom and opportunity your 
children will be allowed, but in no case will it be so much as to 
upset the policies of the state.  A federal court ends busing to 
achieve racial balance in our schools?  Not to worry, it will be 
reinstated by order of the educational bureaucracy.  For above all, in 
Mr. Fine's words, "schools...must mirror the public they serve." 
 <p>
So much for scholarship.  So much for individual freedom.  And so much 
for the Constitution, which uses the word diversity not at all but 
speaks volumes about liberty and the unalienable right to pursue 
opportunity. 
 <p>
Several  school districts, including the state's largest, have already 
adopted policies that will deny a student's choice of school if it 
would upset the racial balance of the school.  So a de facto quota is 
now in place:  no whites may transfer into school A; or no more than a 
certain number of blacks will be allowed into school B.  Delaware's 
school assignment policies have regressed a full century, once again 
allocating students based upon the color of their skin. 
 <p>
Most disturbing, though, is the reasoning of the State Board.  The 
1977 District Court busing order, as mistaken as it was, prohibited 
the state from assigning pupils to schools in racially disparate 
numbers.  The Delaware State Board's policy forbids children from 
choosing to attend schools in a way that will result in racial 
disparity within them. 
 <p>
Over the years, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that the assignment of 
children to school by race was first permitted (Plessy v. Ferguson, 
1896); then forbidden (Brown v. Board of Education , 1954); and now 
constitutionally required (Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenberg, 1971).  But 
these decisions all addressed the question of government assignment of 
children to schools.  The Delaware Board of Education has carried the 
policy a step further.  Now individuals may not choose to act in a way 
that does not "mirror" society. 
 <p>
It is not a new idea, of course. Soviet Russia and Communist China 
governed societies based upon the principle that the individual was 
subservient to the state. 
 <p>
But it is an interesting idea, particularly viewed in juxtaposition 
with Thomas Jefferson's view that "all men are created equal" and 
"endowed by their creator" (not the government) "with certain 
unalienable rights" (that is, unalienable by the government),  
"including the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."  
If memory serves, our Constitution was based upon Mr. Jefferson's 
vision.   
 <p>
Nevertheless, the educational bureaucracy grinds on, limiting 
students' pursuit of opportunity just when it should be adopting a 
more enlightened policy. 
 <p>
Why should government recoil from a straightforward policy with which 
every parent agrees:   no child will be denied admission to the school 
of their choice because of the color of their skin? 
 <P><P>

<title>du Pont--One Jobs Program That Works</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<center><i>November 9, 1995</i><hr>
<h2>One Jobs Program That Works</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>

Last week's District of Columbia appropriations bill contained a 
startling education innovation.  It mandates the establishment of a 
nonprofit corporation governed by the private sector to train and 
place non-college-bound students in jobs. 
<p> 
If, as President Reagan said, "The best social program devised is a 
job,"  then those without jobs or who lack skills that employers want 
need some help to acquire those skills to connect them to the 
workplace. 
 <p>
Both the House and the Senate have recently passed bills resulting in 
a sweeping reform of the federal job training system.  Between 80 and 
125 programs will be consolidated, depending on the final conference 
actions, and overall funding cuts will be between 15% and 25%.    
 <p>
If the conservative revolution in Washington is to succeed, no one 
must be left behind.  One low-cost, high-return way to accomplish this 
is to implement well constructed, economical training in communities 
where jobs are available.  That is the thrust of the two bills in 
Congress - devolving authority, flexibility, and decisions to the 
state and local level - and requiring important private-sector 
involvement in how the funds should be spent. 
 <p>
But the innovation in the District of Columbia may turn out to be the 
most significant step of all. 
 <p>
It is of particular interest to me, because it is based upon an idea I 
developed in my prior life as a governor.  I used the powers states 
had then to devise a better way to train young people for work in the 
real world.  Our idea worked then, and it can be a model for what will 
work now. 
 <p>
"Jobs for Delaware Graduates" (JDG) was created in 1978 as a non-
profit partnership to prepare, counsel, and place high school seniors 
in career jobs.  I committed myself to serve as chair, and challenged 
some of the state's most important business, government, education, 
community and labor leaders to join me in taking personal 
responsibility for the program.  In turn, we hired a staff that would 
each be held personally accountable for helping a group of 35 to 40 of 
our state's most at-risk young people move successfully from school to 
work. 
 <p>
In the very first year, truly impressive results were achieved in the 
test high schools.  Costs were less than one-third that of similar 
programs - including the provision of  nine months' assistance after 
students left school to assure successful placement and performance in 
the private sector. 
 <p>
It was so successful that a number of foundations and government 
agencies helped test the program in four other states.  "Jobs for 
America's Graduates" (JAG) was then created to help bring Delaware's 
success story throughout the country. 
 <p>
Today, I am pleased to report that a majority of states now have the 
JAG program - the largest organization of its kind. 
 <p>
What makes it work?  Why do 90% of these at-risk young people graduate 
from school?  Why is it that within nine months 80% are either on the 
job, in the military, or enrolled in post-secondary education or 
training?  Why is it that JAG shows a 30% improvement in employment?  
Why is it so cost-effective - at $1,200 per participant, less than 
one-third the cost of the national average of similar programs? 
 <p>
Because there is private sector oversight and responsibility, real 
accountability of people to achieve results, and the fact that young 
people themselves must meet the employability requirements of 
businesses and take responsibility for themselves and their lives.  
Governors like Chuck Robb (VA), Kit Bond (MO), and Lamar Alexander 
(TN) joined me in testing and leading the organization.  To date, the 
JAG organization has helped 175,000 young people. 
 <p>
JAG can demonstrate that young people more than repay the cost of 
their participation in the program in taxes paid alone.  Heaven only 
knows how much they would have cost if they hadn't completed school, 
hadn't gotten a job, had gotten on welfare or into trouble with the 
law -- or worse. 
 <p>
Training, counseling, and job placement services can work, if they are 
run by the private sector, involve communities, and demand results.  
 <p>
That is why Speaker Gingrich is so enthusiastic about the value of 
training as part of the welfare reform bill the House has passed.  
That is why so many of us conservatives have found ourselves 
supporting bottomline, low-cost ways to make sure that we don't leave 
any of our young people behind - each gets a decent chance to complete 
school and get a good job upon graduating.  And that is why the 
Speaker and Labor Secretary Robert Reich will keynote the 
organization's 14th anniversary celebration this month. 
 <p>
Supporting America's young people, conserving the cost of social 
programs and protecting the base of our taxpayers in the future are 
good, sound, conservative principles.  In "Jobs for America's 
Graduates," they work in practice.

<h2> Bringing Medical Advances to Patients Sooner 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>
Some 70 Americans will die today because the Food and Drug 
Administration doesn't allow existing medical technology to be used to 
save their lives. 
 <p>
If the FDA approves a product that eventually causes a problem in the 
marketplace, it gets into trouble.  But if the product isn't available 
in the United States and isn't generally known to exist, the FDA 
doesn't get into trouble even if thousands of people die for lack of 
it. 
 <p>
Thus there was no outcry even though 119,000 people died of 
hypertension or heart disease during an eight-year wait for beta 
blockers to be approved.  Or when more than 2,000 died from heart 
disease during three years of waiting for Mevacor.  Or when 3,500 died 
of kidney cancer during the three-year wait for Interleukin-2. 
 <p>
The procedures for bringing new products to use in the United States 
are among the slowest and most expensive in the developed world.  In 
the 1960s it took six years for the FDA to approve a new drug.  Now it 
takes almost 16 years, even with the recently heralded reduction in 
the time required for final review to just over a year and a half. 
 <p>
It's time to help the elderly and the ill by bringing drugs and 
medical devices to market more quickly.  The Progress & Freedom 
Foundation has a proposal to do it.  It would separate the development 
and product review process from the FDA's role of enforcing mandated 
safety and effectiveness standards. 
 <p>
The FDA would license private entities called Drug or Device 
Certifying Bodies (DCBs), which drug or device manufacturers would 
retain to oversee their product's development.  Since manufacturers 
could choose among DCBs, they could compete to produce a lower-cost, 
faster, and higher quality process for drug and device development and 
review. 
 <p>
More important, the FDA would have 90 days to approve a positive 
recommendation by a DCB.  If it did not act, the use of the drug or 
device would be allowed.  This would be far different from now, when 
the FDA raises hurdle after hurdle, requires more and more tests, 
never saying yes, but rarely daring to just say no.  The current 
bureaucratic gridlock would be broken, so that more effective 
treatments can get to the ill. 
 <p>
There's no reason private entities should not be used to review a drug 
application.  Private entities already perform all functions involved 
in this process except the final approval step.  Currently, the FDA 
requires sponsors of new drugs to obtain approval to begin clinical 
trials, and then continues to oversee the sponsor's clinical program 
through regular reports and other mechanisms.  After the clinical 
studies are completed, sponsors apply for FDA approval.  The FDA does 
no testing, but only reviews the data collected through clinical 
trials. The FDA would review the DCB's analysis of the data, and could 
veto approval if it found the new drug unsafe or ineffective. 
 <p>
The approval process for medical devices needs to be changed, too.  
Currently, if a device is not substantially equivalent to one already 
on the market, it must go through a complex clinical trial process 
even if it's a simple device that carries little or no risk.  The 
breast examination pad, for example, is two pieces of plastic with a 
layer of silicone in between.  It has no moving parts, is non-toxic, 
and in use does not invade the body.  But it is illegal in the United 
States because there is no analogous product on the market.  So years 
of testing loom while women whose lives could be saved by it are 
forbidden to use it. 
 <p>
Finally, there is the question of liability.  Where the treatment of 
patients with serious medical problems is involved, there are going to 
be adverse outcomes from the use of drugs and even death on occasion, 
no matter how responsible the manufacturer and how strict the 
regulation.  U.S. companies are not permitted to defend themselves 
from lawsuits simply by pleading that they have complied with 
regulations.  As a result, manufacturers of some pharmaceuticals have 
simply quit making them.  Here, we might look to Europe, where 
regulatory standards protect the patient, but a company is free of 
tort liability if it can show that the state of scientific and 
technical knowledge when the product went into circulation was not 
such as to enable the existence of the defect to be discovered. 
 <p>
The FDA was designed for the 1930s and is bureaucratically incapable 
of handling the exploding technological advances of medicine in the 
1990s.  We must change the current system for bringing medical 
products to the marketplace so that our citizens will receive the full 
benefits of the dramatic scientific discoveries and medical 
breakthroughs our nation's vast research establishment is producing. 
 
And they need those benefits while they are still alive.

<title>du Pont--  Should Prisoners be Allowed to Work? 
</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">



<center><i>November 29, 1995</i><hr>

<h2> Should Prisoners be Allowed to Work? 
</h2>



<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>

</center><hr>  

 <p>
 
Most people would agree that if prisoners learned a skill while they 
were in jail they could more easily get a job when they got out, and 
that an ex-prisoner with a job is less likely to commit another crime.  
Since nearly one-half of people released from prison return to prison 
within three years, job skills could mean a significant decline in the 
crime rate. 
 <P>
The problem is that most productive prison work - other than food or 
laundry work within the prison itself - is against the law. 
 <P>
In 1936, Congress banned convict labor on federal contracts exceeding 
$10,000 in value.  In 1940 the Ashurst-Sumners Act made it a federal 
crime to transport convict-made goods in interstate commerce.  And 
many state legislatures have enacted laws to prohibit the sale of 
convict-made goods within their borders.  States like New York 
compromised and adopted the "state-use" system, which permitted 
convicts to manufacture goods for sale to governmental agencies only, 
which provides a very limited market for the fruits of convict labor. 
 <P>
These statutes were a form of protectionism - to protect providers of 
goods and services in the free market from having to compete with 
convict labor.  Small businesses and labor unions view such 
competition as unfair, and have successfully prevented relaxation of 
the statutes.  When Congress tried to change the laws in 1979, the 
best it could do was allow prisoner work if they are paid the 
prevailing wage, labor union officials approve, local labor is 
unaffected, and no local unemployment is produced.  These criteria are 
nearly impossible to meet, so a mere 1,660 prisoners, out of one 
million, were working under these waivers in 1994.  
 <P>
It was not always this way.  In the last century, prisons earned a 
major part of their daily cost by leasing convict labor to private 
employers.  In 1885, three-fourths of prison inmates were involved in 
productive labor, the majority working for private employers under 
contract and leasing arrangements.  By the 1930s only 44% worked, and 
nearly all worked for state industries rather than for private 
employers.  A 1990 Census found that only 11% of prisoners worked in 
prison manufacturing or farming, down from 16% in 1984.  If part-time 
work in laundry and food services is included, only about half of 
prisoners work. <P>
 
Many prisoners are eager to work, if only to relieve the tedium of 
prison life.  But more important is that the work is good for society 
in the long run because it reduces crime.  A 1983-87 Federal Post-
Release Employment Project study confirmed that employed prisoners do 
better than others without jobs.  Prisoners who work have fewer 
disciplinary problems in prison and lower rates of re-arrest; they are 
more likely to get a full-time job; more likely to quit their job in 
favor of a better-paying job; and less likely to have their 
supervision revoked for a parole violation or new crime.  In the words 
of Thomas Townsend, president of the Corrections Industry Association, 
"It's a matter of public safety:  inmates who have worked in prison, 
and gained new skills have a significantly better chance of not 
returning to crime and prison...." <P>
 
The only disadvantages of more work opportunities for prisoners are 
the feared competitive effects on local labor markets.  But the 
government's first responsibility is to citizens, not to narrow 
interest groups.  New production benefits all Americans.  It raises 
the demand for their services and creates new goods for purchase.  
Competition is the strength of our economic system,  not a wrong to be 
righted, so our policies should be breaking down, not erecting, 
barriers to work - especially when the work will make the streets 
safer for the rest of us. 
 <P>
Allowing prisoners to work makes sense.  Begin by repealing state and 
federal limitations on inmate pay.  Let responsible private businesses 
competitively bid for the use of prison labor.  Let prisons "profit" 
from accepting these contracts.  Provide monetary incentives to 
prisons and their wardens for leading their institutions to self-
sufficiency. <P>
 
It won't be easy for the private-sector bidders, because prison labor 
is not easy to use.  Difficulties include security problems, lack of 
skills and good work habits, remote prison locations, and poor worker 
productivity.  At least at the beginning, the market value of prisoner 
labor will be very low and the quality of their work poor.  But both 
will improve as skills improve. 
 <P>
Across the country a million prisoners are serving time in jail.  Each 
month, 40,000 of them are released under mandatory supervision, on 
parole, or at the conclusion of their sentences.  Our streets would be 
safer and the crime rate lower if these men had a skill, a job, and 
the beginning of a future.

<title>du Pont--  The Great Flat Tax Debate 
</title>

</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">



<center><i>December 6, 1995</i><hr>

<h2>The Great Flat Tax Debate 
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>Should America replace its current income tax with a flat tax, a 
single, low-rate tax - say 19% - applied to ALL income above a 
personal exemption of, say, $36,000 for a family of four? 
 <P>
Yes, said the conservative team led by William F. Buckley, Jr. and 
former Democratic Governor Jerry Brown of California in a two-hour 
Firing Line debate taped at Texas Christian University.  Absolutely 
not, replied the liberals, captained by former U. S. Senator George 
McGovern and MIT economist Lester Thurow.  (Before reading on, you 
should know that I was a member of the conservative team.) The debate 
will be aired on PBS the week of December 18th. 
 <P>
The case for the flat tax is based upon three ideas:  it is fairer for 
all to pay the same rate; it will spur growth to create millions of 
jobs and billions of dollars in personal income, and the current 
income tax is grossly unfair, riddled with loopholes and preferences. 
 <P>
A flat tax will be fairer because everyone will pay it.  It will be 
progressive but not penalize effort, and all the special loopholes 
will be gone.  It will be simple enough for most people to fill out on 
a postcard. 
 <P>
As for growth, the National Center for Policy Analysis calculated that 
the flat tax proposed by Governor Brown in 1992 would create 2 million 
new jobs in two years and increase the Gross National Product by 10% 
by the year 2000. 
 <P>
Finally, few will disagree that our current tax system is 
fundamentally flawed and grossly unfair.  The government takes one-
third of what the average person earns each year (more if you are 
successful) and confiscates one-half of whatever is left when we die - 
the family farm, the small business we have built, or the savings we 
have worked so hard to accumulate. 
 <P>
Worse, the Congress opens and closes loopholes every year to reward 
its friends, punish its enemies, and, most important of all, to make 
sure its members are re-elected.  There have been 4,000 changes to the 
tax code since the last "reform" was enacted in 1986.  Our politicized 
tax code takes varying amounts of money from people who have earned 
it, and transfers it to people who haven't, but who the Congress 
thinks have a superior claim to it. 
<P> 
So who is for replacing this mess with a flat tax?  Well, the 
Washington Post:  "the ideal income tax is a flat percentage of all 
income above a threshold of $10,000."  President Clinton's chief of 
staff, Leon Panetta, introduced a flat tax bill as a member of 
Congress in 1982.  And 57% of the TCU students who expressed an 
opinion in a poll conducted prior to the debate favored a flat tax. 
 <P>
And who is against it?  Presumably Republican President Teddy 
Roosevelt, who helped enact the progressive income tax in 1913.  And 
Karl Marx, who initially popularized "a heavy graduated income tax" to 
redistribute income. 
 <P>
But most passionately, Lester Thurow, who confessed in a defining 
moment in the debate that if HE were writing the tax code it would 
contain a progressive consumption tax with top rates "way over 100%" 
so that the wealthy  would find it prohibitively expensive to buy the 
things they buy. "You couldn't have," he said, turning to Bill 
Buckley, "your boat."  
 <P>
Professor Thurow chose an interesting example, for the luxury tax on 
yachts - a mere 10%, not the 100%-plus he proposed - enacted by the 
liberals in 1990 to punish the rich nearly destroyed the U.S. boat-
building industry.  Those punished by the luxury tax (which also 
applied to aircraft and jewelry) turned out to be not the wealthy, but 
the thousands of working people thrown out of work and the taxpayers 
forced to pay $24 million in unemployment benefits to them.  And the 
luxury tax only collected $17 million.  So much for the Thurow theory 
of economics. 
 <P>
But the debate was more than sound and fury.  Senator McGovern came 
around to the view that the double taxation of company earnings was 
wrong.  And liberal economics writer Robert Kuttner conceded under 
fire that if a tax system raised the incomes of all but the wealthiest 
taxpayers 10%, and the wealthiest by 20%, it would still be a good 
thing.  Of course, he denied it could ever happen. 
 <P>
But no one on the left could satisfactorily answer Bill Buckley's 
opening question:  Why should a cab driver working 60 hours a week be 
punished for his extra effort by paying a higher tax rate than his 
neighbor who drove his hack only 40 hours?   
 <P>
Nor could they explain how the current tax system differed from what 
the American patriots listed in the Declaration of Independence as one 
of their grievances against the British King:   He has "sent hither 
swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance." 
 <P>
That sounds an awful lot like the IRS.

<title>du Pont--  A Christmas Carol
</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>

<h2>
A Christmas Carol
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>
It's not long until Christmas, a very special time for all families.  
In Washington, Christmas is a very special time, too.  The president 
has lit the national Christmas tree.  And lobbyists are beginning to 
think about what kinds of presents they would like to receive this 
year. 
 <P>
I've been rattling some of the packages under the national Christmas 
tree trying to guess what some companies and organizations could be 
getting. 
 <P>
Here's a nice present.  Let's see - it's from the Department of 
Agriculture's Market Promotion Program.  You know, a recent study from 
the Cato Institute pointed out that this department of the government 
spends $110 million a year underwriting the cost of promoting American 
products abroad. 
<P>
Let's see what's inside.  Well, there's $2.9 million to Pillsbury to 
advertise its muffins and pies in foreign countries.  Here's another 
$10 million to promote Sunkist oranges.  And look - $465,000 to 
advertise McDonald's Chicken McNuggets abroad.  That's so thoughtful.  
One of the great things about Christmas is the ability to help someone 
in need.  Without government help, how would McDonald's ever find 
half-a-million dollars to advertise its McNuggets?  
<P> 
The Cato Institute study also points out that:  "Martin Marietta 
Corporation charged the Pentagon $263,000 for a Smokey Robinson 
concert, $20,000 for the purchase of golf balls and $7,500 for a 1993 
office Christmas party.  Ecology and Environment, Inc., of Lancaster, 
New York, spent $243,000 of funds designated for environmental clean-
up on 'employee morale' and $37,000 on tennis lessons, bike races, 
golf tournaments and other entertainment."  As they say in Hollywood:  
That's entertainment! 
 <P>
The Cato Institute estimates that there are more than 125 government 
programs that subsidize private business.  In fiscal year 1995, more 
than $85 billion of taxpayers' money was spent on these programs.  
Now, let's see what else is here.  Oh, here's a big one.  The card 
says this one goes to the sugar industry.  Now isn't that nice:  $1.4 
billion in price supports.  I know the sugar industry will appreciate 
Congress' thoughtfulness--especially the 33 largest cane plantations 
which will receive more than $1 million each. 
 <P>
Of course, there are the gifts that keep on giving, too:  dairy price 
supports, which keep the price of milk much higher than it otherwise 
would be so that the dairy industry will profit.  Then there are gifts 
called "marketing orders" - regulations that govern how many oranges, 
almonds and other products can be grown. 
 <P>
Then there's President Clinton's Christmas shopping list--a few items 
he put in his latest budget.  For example, $333 million for the New 
Generation of Vehicles program, or the "Clean Car Initiative," which 
the White House says will "ensure the global competitiveness of the 
U.S. automobile industry."  That would be GM, Ford, and Chrysler, who 
collectively made nearly $10 billion in profits last year.  I guess a 
gift from the government of another $333 million would still be 
appreciated. 
 <P>
Of course, the suggestion of eliminating or even just slowing this 
government spending spree can result in people calling you a modern 
day Scrooge.  That association obviously misses two important points:  
First, nobody wants to hurt the Tiny Tims of this country; just the 
opposite.  Those who are trying to cut all of these presents to 
wealthy corporations are doing so precisely because they want to make 
sure there is enough for the Tiny Tims. 
 <P>
Second, associating budget-cutting with Scrooge implies that the 
federal government - like Scrooge - has a lot of money that it 
selfishly doesn't want to part with.  But the federal government 
doesn't have a surplus of money lying around.  That debt is the Ghost 
of Christmas Past.  Congress has often been generous in the past, so 
lobbyists continue to press for more presents.  And because we are 
moving into an election year, the congressional spirit of generosity 
towards big businesses can be stronger than usual. 
 <P>
For most of us, Christmas is about sharing, especially with those who 
have the least.  For Washington, Christmas can also be about sharing - 
sharing our tax dollars with those who have the most.  Of course, it's 
easy to be generous with other people's money - especially when its 
the next generation's.  And that's where the Ghost of Christmas Future 
comes in.  No nation will long prosper by stealing from its children.  
If the Congress is serious about cutting the growth in federal 
spending so that we don't leave future generations of American 
overwhelmed with debt, it must cut back on its corporate Yule Tide 
generosity. 
<P> 
Otherwise, how in the "Dickens" are we going to get federal spending 
under control?

<title>du Pont:   Maintaining the Value of the Dollar -- 12/22/95
</title>

</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>



<center><i>December 20, 1995</i><hr>

<h2>
Maintaining the Value of the Dollar
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>
Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power "to 
coin money [and] regulate the value thereof." 
 <P>
Nowhere does the Constitution tell Congress how much money to coin, 
how it should be valued, or how the government should regulate these 
matters.  In 1913, the Congress gave the power to decide those issues 
to the Federal Reserve, which quickly became - and still remains - the 
most powerful economic institution in the nation. 
 <P>
As our nation's central bank, the Fed decides how much money will be 
available in our banking system to make loans.  So in addition to 
controlling the money supply, it largely controls short-term interest 
rates.  With control over the money supply and interest rates, the Fed 
then has enormous influence over real economic growth, unemployment, 
and inflation in our economy.    
 <P>
Most people know little - and care less - about monetary aggregates, 
discount rates, and other technical Fed issues.  But every American 
understands that a primary responsibility of the government is to 
maintain the value of our money.  A government that intentionally (or 
even unintentionally) erodes the value of earnings and savings is 
undermining current prosperity and the future prospects of its 
citizens.  Along with establishing justice, ensuring domestic 
tranquillity and providing for the common defense - to quote the 
preamble to the Constitution - sound money,  a dollar "as good as 
gold," is the ranking economic priority of the nation. 
 <P>
The trouble is, that's not what the law says.  The Employment Act of 
1946, as amended by the Humphrey-Hawkins Act of 1978, legally sets 
"full employment" as the primary goal of Federal Reserve policy.  This 
law requires the Fed to stimulate the economy with lower interest 
rates and the coining of more money whenever the unemployment rate 
rises.   
 <P>
Of course these two actions can quickly lead to higher inflation,  
which devalues our money.  Nevertheless,  whenever unemployment rises, 
even when inflation is already too high, the Fed is legally required 
to stimulate the economy.  So inflation ratchets higher and higher, 
until a recession occurs and moderates the inflation.  
 <P>
Such economic cycles roll through our economy much as weather fronts 
roll across the country.  But unlike storms, economic cycles build 
upon each other.  History has often seen that both at the trough of 
each new recession and at the peak of each cycle of expansion, 
inflation and unemployment were higher than they had been the time 
before.   
 <P>
So there is a "catch 22" in which higher inflation leads to higher 
unemployment.  Then under the Humphrey-Hawkins rule, the higher 
unemployment requires additional Fed stimulus, which in turn leads to 
even higher inflation.  These kind of cycles and pressures hinder the 
Fed's long run ability to maintain the value of our money.  As long as 
the Humphrey-Hawkins law remains unchanged, the value of our savings 
remains at risk. 
 <P>
Right now inflation is under control, and unemployment is low, so the 
Fed faces no dilemma.  But sooner or later the Fed will again face 
that hard choice of whether to obey the law and temporarily reduce 
unemployment at the cost of higher inflation, or violate the law and 
stick with price stability.  The Fed should not have to face such a 
choice.   
 <P>
Senator Connie Mack (R-FL) and Congressman Jim Saxton (R-NJ), who co-
chair Congress's Joint Economic Committee, have introduced legislation 
to end the Feds dilemma of choosing between full employment and low 
inflation. They would do so by repealing the Humphrey-Hawkins Act and 
replacing it with the Economic Growth and Price Stability Act. 
 <P>
This new legislation would change the Fed's policy mandate by 
establishing price stability as its primary mission.  It would no 
longer be required to stimulate the economy to create full employment, 
and could concentrate all its efforts on maintaining the value of the 
dollar by controlling inflation. 
 <P>
Mack and Saxton believe that in the long run, maintaining price 
stability is the best thing the Fed can do to keep unemployment down 
and encourage real growth in the economy, which in turn will create 
more jobs.  Thus, ironically, getting rid of the full employment 
Humphrey-Hawkins requirement is actually the best way to achieve full 
employment. 
 <P>
 
Maintaining the value of our money must be the Fed's first 
responsibility, and Congress should say so by law.

<h2>Spiritual Renewal</h2></center><P> 

[Today's the first day of the new year -- the perfect time to examine our 
personal weaknesses and the shortcomings of our society, and resolve to 
fix what needs fixing.]
<p>
In an essay published in the November issue of Hillsdale College's 
monthly journal, Imprimis, former Education Secretary William Bennett 
says that the last 30 years have been a period of cultural decline for 
America. During the last three decades, he says, "there was a 560 percent 
increase in violent crime; more than a 400 percent increase in illegitimate 
births; a quadrupling in divorces; a tripling of the percentage of children 
living in single-parent homes: more than a 200 percent increase in the 
teenage suicide rate; and a drop of 75 points in the average SAT scores of 
high school students." When it comes to social pathology, America sets 
the global pace. "We are at, or near, the top in rates of abortions, 
divorces, and unwed births," says Bennett. "We lead the industrialized 
world in murder, rape, and violent crime. And in elementary and 
secondary education, we are at, or near, the bottom in achievement 
scores."<p>

There are other, harder-to-measure "signs of decay." Bennett suggests 
that "there is a coarseness, a callousness, a cynicism. a banality, and a 
vulgarity to our time" and laments in particular the deleterious effect on 
children. "We live in a culture which at times seems almost dedicated to 
the corruption of the young, to assuring the loss of their innocence before 
their time," he says. Where are the protesters? Why doesn't anyone do 
anything? "We have become inured to the cultural rot that is setting in," 
concludes Bennett. "People are experiencing atrocity overload, losing 
their capacity for shock, disgust, and outrage."
<p>
Bennett insists that "the real crisis of our time is spiritual." He says that 
"our desires are turned toward the wrong things. And only when we turn 
them toward the right things -- toward enduring, noble, spiritual things -- 
will things get better." That's going to be rather difficult as long as there 
persists "a disturbing reluctance in our time to talk seriously about 
matters spiritual and religious." Bennett says that, "when millions of 
people stop believing in God, or when their belief is so attenuated as to 
be belief in name only, enormous public consequences follow. And when 
this is accompanied by an aversion to spiritual language by the political 
and intellectual class, the public consequences are even greater."
<p>
William Bennett recommends four steps toward "spiritual renewal." The 
first is to recognize the "intrinsic limits to what the state can do, 
particularly when it comes to imparting virtue, and forming and forging 
character, and providing peace to souls." The second is to reinvest public 
policy with "our deepest beliefs." The third is to "recover a sense of the 
fundamental purpose of education," which is moral instruction. Last, says 
Bennett, "we need to return religion to its proper place" in society -- no 
matter how much it may disconcert those who flee from faith.

<h2>Vincent Foster</h2></center><P> 

[More than two years after it occurred, the death of White House Counsel 
Vincent Foster continues to raise troubling questions.]
<p>
The body of White House Counsel Vincent Foster was discovered in Fort 
Marcy Park across the Potomac River from Washington DC, at 6 p.m. on 
July 20, 1993. The U.S. Park Police found a pistol in Foster's hand and 
quickly ruled the death a suicide. Nevertheless, a poll conducted by Time 
magazine and CNN two years later revealed that 65 percent of Americans 
do not accept the official verdict in the case.
<p>
Government investigators have ignored evidence suggesting that Foster's 
body was dumped in Fort Marcy Park, and that he may not have taken his 
own life. The suspicious nature of Foster's death, and his connection to 
the Whitewater and Travelgate scandals, make this one of the biggest 
news stories of the 1990s. Yet, only one reporter in America is 
investigating the Foster death on a full time basis. Christopher Ruddy 
began his probe as an investigative reporter for the New York Post in 
1993 . Now associated with the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, Ruddy 
continues his one-man crusade to find out what really happened to "the 
highest ranking federal official in more than 30 years [to die] under very 
suspicious circumstances."
<p>
Ruddy summarizes the many inconsistencies in the case in a new report 
available from the nonprofit Western Journalism Center entitled Vincent 
Foster: The Ruddy Investigation. Ruddy points out that a confidential 
Secret Service memo written on the night of Foster's death stated that 
"U.S. Park Police discovered the body of Vincent Foster in his car." He 
says a senior Park Police investigator admitted that she and her 
colleagues reached a verdict of suicide "prior to going up and looking at 
the body."
<p>
Three handwriting experts have declared Foster's so called suicide note a 
forgery. "A note torn into 28 pieces, leaving no fingerprints and said to 
have been written by Foster, was found almost a week after his death," 
says Ruddy, but it lacks the contents typical of a suicide note -- no 
mention of death, no farewell to loved ones, and so on. The lack of an 
accounting for Foster's whereabouts during the last five hours of his life 
is also problematic, says Ruddy, noting that "no one came forward to 
claim they had seen him alive at the park or even around Washington, 
that fateful afternoon."<p>

The suicide scene itself was atypical. Foster's body was neatly arranged. 
"The fired bullet was never found. No one heard the fatal shot," says 
Ruddy. "Trace analysis of Foster's shoes at the FBI lab found not a speck 
of soil on his shoes or clothing despite a 700-foot-plus trek through the 
heavily wooded park."
<p>
All Ruddy wants is straight answers to some simple questions. "If Foster 
didn't shoot himself . . . who did? Where? How did he really die? These 
are the questions investigators should have asked," says Ruddy. "Their 
answers lead to other, logical questions about the strong evidence that the 
body was moved to the park."

<h2>Terrorism</h2></center><P> 

[The threat to American security posed by Libyan and Iranian terrorists 
doesn't seem to loom as large today as it did in the early 1980s, but the 
threat remains.]
<p>
Former FBI agent Ray Wannall says that Iran and Libya have held 
grudges against the United States since at least the early 1980s. "Their 
terroristic threats against the U.S. were intensified following our raid on 
Tripoli and Benghazi, Libya in 1986, the accidental shooting down of an 
Iranian Airbus in the Persian Gulf in 1988, and the U.S. downing of two 
Libyan fighter jets over the Mediterranean the following year."
<p>
Wannall recalls that early in 1985 Muammar Qaddafi urged black 
American servicemen to leave the military and form a separate army 
because the United States "must be destroyed." In a 40-minute satellite 
address from Libya to a Nation of Islam convention in Chicago, Qaddafi 
declared: "This country must be destroyed. They refuse to accept you as 
American citizens. This means you are obliged to create a separate and 
independent state." Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, 
endorsed the Libyan dictator's remarks, saying, "Brother Qaddafi is a 
man the world does not understand."
<p>
In that 1985 speech, Qaddafi incited Farrakhan's followers to 
insurrection. "You have the force, you have the soldiers," said Qaddafi. 
"We are ready to give you arms, because your cause is just. We are with 
you. Don't worry. You have to trust us. We will fight together shoulder 
by shoulder. The final victory will be soon." Though claiming to have 
declined the offer of arms, Farrakhan did accept a $5 million interest-free 
loan from Qaddafi, ostensibly to underwrite a commercial enterprise to 
help black Americans create financial independence.
<p>
The Washington Times reported in 1985 that a radical Islamic 
infrastructure of terror has been established across the U.S., consisting of 
safehouses, weapons, ammunition, money, and systems to provide 
medical and legal aid, false identity papers, and transportation. Followers 
of Qaddafi and Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini man this network, ready to 
spring into action when the word comes. Appearing before Congress the 
following year, FBI Director William Webster warned that three-fourths 
of the 2,000 Libyan students in the U.S. were financed by the Libyan 
government and could constitute a terrorist threat.
<p>
Former FBI Executive Assistant Director Oliver Revell warned earlier 
this year that it is likely that a radical Islamic fundamentalist 
infrastructure has been firmly established in our country. The radical 
fundamentalists "support such organizations as Hezbollah, Hamas, and 
the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which are directly involved in terrorism and 
violently oppose the Israeli-PLO initiative," says Revell. "These 
organizations are aided and supported by Iran, including its diplomatic 
establishments and intelligence services, which makes them even more 
dangerous."<p>

Ray Wannall says the Iranians and the Libyans "have not tempered their 
threats in recent years. Nor has Louis Farrakhan given any sign of 
rejecting Qaddafi's avowed friendship and support. Jihad, the holy war 
waged on behalf of Islam as a religious duty, is still being fought."

<h2>Medical Savings Accounts</h2></center><P> 

[Medical Savings Accounts are an idea whose time has come. By 
returning control over medical choices to the individual, MSAs should 
rein in the spiraling costs of health care.]
<p>
Peter Ferrara of the National Center for Policy Analysis says that "health 
care costs are out of control" because the wrong people are paying the 
bills. The patients, the ones receiving medical care, do not generally pay 
their own bills. The bills are paid, for the most part, by third parties -- 
employers, insurance companies, or the government. The average 
American pays only one-fifth of his own health care costs. "Someone else 
pays the rest," says Ferrara, and that third-party payment system is what 
is driving up health care costs. Americans simply have no personal 
incentive for monitoring the costs of their health care and shopping 
around for less expensive alternatives.
<p>
The solution is simple: Take control over health care away from third 
parties and give it back to the people who are using it. Give them a 
personal, financial incentive for keeping costs down. Ferrara says it is 
only human nature for people to be careless, even extravagant shoppers 
"if we are spending someone else's money." And it's only natural for 
doctors and other health care providers to encourage us to take advantage 
of extra tests and procedures -- just to be on the safe side -- "if they know 
that we are not paying the bills." But Americans spend their own money 
in every other marketplace, and they make wiser decisions when they do 
so. Why, then, is the marketplace of medical care different from all the 
others?
<p>
1996 looks to be the year that Congress begins restoring economic sanity 
to our health care system. The Archer-Jacobs bill will encourage 
individuals and their employers to make tax-free deposits into Medical 
Savings Accounts (MSAs), which employees can draw on to cover 
ordinary health expenses. MSAs will let Americans choose the care they 
want and spend their health care dollars as they see fit, thereby providing 
a huge incentive to keep health costs down.
<p>
With Medical Savings Accounts, employees would be spending their own 
money for non-catastrophic health care. As a result, Peter Ferrara says, 
"they would have excellent financial incentives to control the cost of such 
care. They would seek to avoid unnecessary care, look for quality plus 
value in doctors and hospitals, and consider whether the services were 
worth the prices." Medical Savings Accounts would have other benefits 
too, such as reduced administrative costs.
<p>
If Americans switch to Medical Savings Accounts in large numbers, 
health care spending will decline dramatically. MSAs will give 
consumers more choices and more control in health care decisions. These 
accounts will be portable too, not linked to continued employment at a 
specific location. MSA funds can be applied to any type of health care, 
and are not subject to the approval of insurers or health maintenance 
organizations. Medical Savings Accounts will harness the power of our 
remarkable free-enterprise system to make American medical care 
affordable again.<p>

<h2>"No-Win Situation" in Bosnia </h2></center><P> 
 
[Syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer says that sending U.S.  
troops to Bosnia is a "serious mistake" and a "no-win situation."]  
  <P>
In a recent issue of The Weekly Standard, Charles Krauthammer argues  
that U.S. involvement in Bosnia will have one of two unacceptable  
outcomes. Either it will end in "a humiliating retreat . . . after some  
incident involving a major loss of American life and cries from the  
Congress and the American people for withdrawal. Or, more likely, we  
will persevere, indeed escalate our involvement, send more troops to  
protect existing troops and be caught in a long-term, static, and defensive  
deployment with painful losses, ambiguous rules of engagement,  
escalating friction among NATO allies . . . and no way out."  
  <P>
Krauthammer says American troops are going into Bosnia with "no  
definable objective, no identifiable enemy, no exit strategy." Being the  
"sole remaining superpower" and having the "finest, most powerful  
military" do not obligate the United States to be the world's peacekeeper.  
"It is decidedly not the role of a superpower to place itself between the  
combatants in a civil war of marginal importance to the world balance of  
power . . . among unreconciled parties who have already shown a  
propensity for killing and kidnapping peacekeepers."  
  <P>
"Peacekeeping is the job of small countries with no particular interest in  
the outcome of a conflict," says Krauthammer. "It is far harder for a  
superpower to remain neutral, and even harder to be perceived as neutral,  
in most conflicts. And, in the Bosnian war, in particular, the United States  
has been decidedly not neutral. We have made our sympathies with the  
Bosnian Muslim side abundantly clear in our declarations, in our use of  
air power, and indeed in our promises to arm the Bosnian government  
even as we act as peacekeepers."  
  <P>
"If the combatants in Bosnia are serious about ending the fighting and  
accepting roughly the distribution of territory and roughly the balance of  
power now on the ground, then they should do it and enforce it  
themselves," says Krauthammer. "If they are not, then there is no peace to  
keep. And between such antagonists is no place to interpose American  
troops."  
  <P>
Krauthammer concedes that "reneging" on the promise to deploy troops  
"would be a blow to NATO," but contends that "following through and  
actually sending the troops would be worse." He describes as "nonsense"  
the argument that "we must intervene in Bosnia because of the  
continuing, indeed intensifying, threat the war poses to European  
stability." He says "the war is in fact contracting" and that the great  
nations of Europe have no reason to make war "over the control of this  
cursed, tragic piece of land." While acknowledging that American  
credibility is damaged "whenever the United States makes a commitment  
and then reneges on it," Krauthammer insists that the blame belongs to  
"the administration that made that foolish promise without proper  
reflection." Congress, on the other hand, should be applauded for "trying  
to avert the consequences of that ill-considered promise."

<center><h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4><i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a> <br>January 9, 1996<br></i><hr><h2> Dole on NAFTA</h2></center><P> 
 [The efforts of Senator Bob Dole to distance himself from the North 
American Free Trade Agreement could signal a historic shift in U.S. trade 
policy.] 
 <P>
"The callous behavior of Bill Clinton and his trade allies in Congress in 
bulldozing the GATT and NAFTA treaties through in the face of the 
overwhelming opposition of the American people set the stage for the 
current counterrevolution on the trade front," says William Gill of the 
American Coalition for Competitive Trade. The seeds of that 
counterrevolution "were first sewn in 1990," says Gill, with publication 
of a book called Trade Wars Against America. That book persuaded Pat 
Buchanan and other conservative leaders that so-called free trade is "a 
destructive aberration that goes against the Constitution -- and the 
protectionist policy of George Washington and the other Founders -- the 
policy that built America." 
 <P>
Gill's group, the American Coalition for Competitive Trade, intends to 
keep publicizing the defects of free trade "until public opinion finally 
forces the government to repudiate this insane policy that is strangling 
America." As casualties of our country's self-defeating trade policy, Gill 
cites the nearly 80,000 mid-level managers to be laid off by AT&T, the 
12,000 bank employees made redundant by the pending merger of 
Chemical Bank and Chase Manhattan, the 1800 millworkers left stranded 
by the shutdown of Bethlehem Steel, and the 3200 textile workers let 
loose by Fruit of the Loom. 
 <P>
"Nowhere has the frenzy to cut jobs been more apparent than in the 
nation's once invincible defense industries," says Gill, noting that 
1,300,000 defense workers have lost their jobs since 1988, and 700,000 
more will be let go in the next two years. "Although most of these two 
million jobs will have disappeared because of cuts in the federal budget, a 
significant number can be traced to trade," says Gill. "Billions of dollars 
have been spent by the armed services on foreign products, many of them 
high-tech items invented in America and once made here before 
production was shipped overseas." As if that weren't bad enough, "it has 
become fashionable for U.S. defense companies to enter into joint 
ventures with foreign firms and governments in the production of some 
of our most sophisticated weaponry." Venture partners such as Japan 
have sold the technology acquired in this manner to our enemies. 
 <P>
Pat Buchanan has made protectionism the cornerstone of his bid for the 
Republican presidential nomination, and the-public's favorable response 
to that theme has not escaped the notice of front-running Republican 
presidential candidate Bob Dole. Last November, Dole expressed 
"significant disappointment" with the results of NAFTA, warned his 
colleagues in the Senate that America is "choking on new agreements," 
and called for a "cooling-off period" on trade pacts. "If Bob Dole sticks to 
his new guns on trade, and if he gets the Republican nomination in 1996, 
he will outflank Bill Clinton on an issue that now has most Americans up 
in arms against it," says Gill.

Duplantier</a> <br>January 10, 1996
<br></i><hr><h2>Abolish the Department of Education</h2></center><P> 
[Abolishing the Department of Education would curb the federal 
government's baleful influence on public schools and save as much as 
$70 billion a year in taxpayers' money.] 
 
 <P>
Early in the 1976 presidential elections, the National Education 
Association threw its important support behind a relatively unknown 
candidate named Jimmy Carter. The NEA endorsement gave visibility to 
the obscure, one-term Georgia governor, adding momentum to his 
ultimately-successful campaign. The endorsement came with a price, 
however, one that President Carter gladly paid. The establishment of the 
federal Department of Education was the quid pro quo that the National 
Education Association received for the push it provided to the political 
presumptions of a pandering peanut farmer. 
 <P>
Of course, the federal government was meddling in education long before 
then, but the creation of a separate cabinet-level department has greatly 
exacerbated the problem. Congress now appropriates $70 billion per year 
for what it calls education. Roughly half of this amount goes to the 
administration of 244 separate programs in the Department of Education. 
The rest is spent by 30 other federal agencies on 308 overlapping 
programs. There are more than 90 separate federal preschool and child 
care programs, administered by eleven different agencies and 20 different 
offices. There are 86 separate federal teacher training programs, 
administered by nine different departments. There are at least 46 separate 
federal youth development programs, administered by eight different 
agencies. None of these programs is necessary, and most of them are 
redundant. 
 <P>
The Federal Government's 30-year experiment with education funding 
has failed miserably. Illiteracy has reached epidemic proportions, and 
Scholastic Aptitude Test scores have dropped so dramatically that the 
Educational Testing Service is now adding nearly 100 points to every 
score to conceal this embarrassing decline. Abolishing the Department of 
Education will not adversely affect our public schools, which flourished 
before the department was created and will survive its termination. 
Federal spending in public schools is only about six percent of their total 
budget, and precious little of it supports legitimate academic pursuits. 
Layoffs of superfluous administrative personnel could easily offset a six-
percent downsizing. 
 <P>
Establishing a federal Department of Education may have worked 
wonders for the National Education Association, but it has done nothing 
positive for America's public schools. In fact, it has had an entirely 
deleterious effect, further weakening local control and adding costly 
government regulations at the expense of academic curricula. The fact 
that it hasn't worked is a good judgment for abolishing the Department of 
Education, but the best argument of all is that the Department is simply 
unconstitutional. The U.S. Constitution  makes no mention of education, 
and provides no authority for the federal government to meddle in local 
schools. The federal government has inserted itself into numerous areas 
beyond its constitutional jurisdiction, and it's time for Americans to insist 
that it return to its proper concerns. Eliminating the Department of 
Education would be a good start.

Duplantier</a> <br>
January 11, 1996<br></i><hr><h2> MSAs Could Save Medicare</h2></center><P> 
[Employees at the Golden Rule Insurance Company in Indianapolis are 
staunch supporters of the proposed Medicare reform called the Medical 
Savings Account. That's because all 1200 employees already have MSAs] 
 
 <P>
The Golden Rule Insurance Company is America's leading writer of 
individual health policies, with 800,000 policyholders and nearly $800 
million in annual revenue. Golden Rule is also the nation's number-one 
promoter of Medical Savings Accounts (known as MSAs), having signed 
up nearly 1000 companies for its MSA group plan. The company is so 
keen on Medical Savings Accounts that it even established an MSA 
group plan for its own employees two years ago, says reporter Bob Jones 
in a recent issue of World magazine. "Golden Rule Chairman Pat Rooney 
has made it his mission to show that MSAs actually work." 
 <P>
Jones explains the logic behind MSAs: "Health care costs will be 
controlled only when people start spending their own money instead of 
the insurance company's. To accomplish this, Medicare would offer 
seniors a new, high-deductible policy. The higher deductible means lower 
premiums; the savings are deposited to an account from which 
individuals can pay- for medical bills that fall below the deductible. 
When expenses in any year exceed the deductible," Jones continues, "the 
catastrophic insurance kicks in, paying 100 percent of remaining bills 
(instead of the 80 percent now covered by Medicare)." 
 <P>
If an individual spends less than his deductible, whatever remains in his 
MSA is "rolled over into a tax-free annuity that can be used to pay future 
medical bills or provide long-term care. This system," Jones says, 
"provides an incentive for seniors to become smart health care 
consumers, costs them no more than the current system, and at the same 
time offers more flexibility and greater benefits." 
 <P>
Under proposed Medicare reforms, "MSAs would be tax deductible like 
IRAs, making them enormously attractive not only to private businesses, 
but also to the millions of self-employed. Even without that tax 
exemption," says Jones, "MSAs have been hugely successful at a few 
pioneering companies like Golden Rule [where] health care costs 
dropped 40 percent the first year that MSAs were implemented." Medical 
Savings Accounts are even more popular among employees, says Jones, 
citing a 1994 study that found a satisfaction level of 98 percent. MSAs 
have even encouraged Golden Rule employees to take better care of 
themselves. "More than a quarter of employees are taking advantage of 
some medical service they never used before, simply because the money 
is there and they can choose how to spend it without having to worry that 
it won't be covered under their policy," says Jones. 
 <P>
The current Medicare trust fund surplus of $130 billion is expected to 
dwindle to zero in seven years. "By 2004," says Jones, "Medicare will 
face a deficit of more than $100 billion." Medical Savings Accounts are 
just what the doctor ordered to avert that grim prospect.

Duplantier</a> <br>January 12, 1996
<br></i><hr><h2>Judicial Usurpation</h2></center><P> 
 
[By extending rights to illegal aliens, federal judges undermine the value 
of American citizenship and de-legitimize self-government.]
<P>
Washington Times columnist Paul Craig Roberts warns that self-
government may be "a thing of the past" in America. He cites a federal 
judge's recent order blocking implementation of California's Proposition 
187, which received 59 percent of the votes cast in a statewide election in 
1994. "The judge," says Roberts, "ruled that the right of illegal aliens to 
publicly-provided benefits, such as education and welfare, exceeded the 
right of citizens to utilize the democratic process to limit or curtail their 
financial obligations to people illegally residing in our country."
<P>
The judge's ruling is just the most recent example of judicial usurpation 
in what has become "a frontal assault on citizenship and the exercise of 
self-rule," says Roberts. "It demeans citizenship by eliminating any 
difference between the claims of citizens and illegal aliens to taxpayer-
provided benefits. And it destroys self-rule by denying citizens the right 
to limit their taxpaying responsibilities through the exercise of the 
democratic process."
<P>
Judges have been undermining citizenship and self-rule for decades. 
Roberts cites a 1982 Supreme Court decision in which five of the nine 
justices "decided that the State of Texas could not restrict the use of its 
limited resources to educate only lawful residents. The court's cavalier 
disregard of the rights of U.S. citizens was not based on any law or legal 
precedent," says Roberts. "It rested entirely on the subjective feelings of 
five justices that it was good social policy for taxpayers to be made to 
finance public education for illegal aliens."
<P>
Roberts notes that Chief Justice Warren Burger and the three other 
dissenting justices "criticized their brethren for violating the separation of 
powers by assuming a policymaking role. The Constitution, they said, 
does not vest the court with 'the authority to strike down laws because 
they do not meet our standards of desirable social policy."' That's exactly 
what the High Court did and got away with, however, thereby 
demonstrating "how readily blackrobed social engineers substitute their 
own policy predilections for the will of the people."
<P>
Judicial decisions "based on feelings and not law" are unworthy of our 
respect, says Roberts. "If Americans are to be ruled by sociology, we 
have no need of law schools. There is nothing in a legal background to 
give jurists guidance on the 'correct' social policy," and every judge who 
oversteps himself in this manner should be swiftly censured. "The 
elevation of social engineering above law and self-rule has dire 
implications," says Roberts, noting that it may now be plausible for 
illegal aliens to resist deportation by claiming the rights of citizenship. 
This much is clear: no republic can survive without respect for the rule of 
law. When the personal agendas of powerful men replace objective 
standards, when emotion usurps reason, our God-given rights cease to be 
secure and we can no longer rely on the truth and the law to defend 
ourselves from injustice.

<h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4>
<i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a> <br>January 15, 1996
<br></i><hr><h2>Long-Term Commitment in Bosnia </h2></center><P>

[Will American troops return from Bosnia in 12 months or less -- or will 
they still be there 20 years from now?] 
 <P>
John Hillen of the Heritage Foundation warns that "there are very serious 
questions that need to be answered about the political viability of the 
[Bosnian peace] accord and the effectiveness of the American military 
intervention to implement it." For starters, how realistic is a Bosnian state 
composed of "two separate political entities -- the Bosnian Muslim/Croat 
Federation and the Bosnian Serb Republic"? For such a state to be viable, 
says Hillen, "the two separate entities will have to show the most 
extraordinary goodwill and cooperation toward each other, qualities that 
have never been in evidence in Bosnia." Hillen contends that "the accord 
does not address fundamental issues of sovereignty and ethnic self-
determination. Instead, it freezes those unresolved issues in place and 
offers up an elaborate power-sharing agreement for a Bosnian central 
government." 
 <P>
The Bosnian Muslim/Croat Federation itself is pretty fragile. "There is 
considerable doubt about the solidarity of this alliance," says Hillen. 
Local support for the peace accord is also tenuous. "All three Bosnian 
Serbs present-at the- Dayton peace talks refused to sign the peace accord, 
and Bosnian Serb leaders denounced the accord within hours of its 
initialing." Among the issues left unsettled by the accord was the question 
of "how to integrate the two (or possibly three) rival armies into one that 
would serve the foreign policies of the central government." With such 
considerations in mind, Hillen concludes that "the United States will 
incur some form of continuing security obligation to Bosnia" far beyond 
its one-year commitment. 
 <P>
"There are also serious questions about the military feasibility of NATO's 
Implementation Force," says John Hillen of the Heritage Foundation. 
"Clearly defined, decisive, and attainable military objectives" have yet to 
be identified. The Bosnian peace implementation plan "strips any 
advantage from American ground forces and places U.S. troops in a 
passive and reactive posture." Despite President Clinton's assertions of a 
limited deployment, "the peace accord opens the door for NATO 
peacekeepers to perform many nation-building activities such as ensuring 
the free movement and resettlement of refugees, aiding humanitarian 
workers, resolving boundary disputes, creating secure conditions for free 
elections, and responding to violence against civilians." 
 <P>
The continuing expansion of peacekeeping duties -- and the perception 
that early withdrawal of U.S. troops could jeopardize the NATO mission 
-- would seem to dictate an extended American presence. "European 
allies have universally condemned President Clinton's proposed timetable 
for American forces in Bosnia," says John Hillen. "President Chirac of 
France has predicted an armed NATO presence that could last up to 20 
years." Clinton knows that the American public would never agree in 
advance to such "a protracted and costly intervention in an area of 
marginal strategic interest," but is counting on our reluctant support for 
his fait accompli. "Once the prestige, blood, and treasure of the United 
States are engaged," the Europeans hope that "the U.S. will have to see 
the intervention through to its conclusion."

<h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4><i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a> <br>January 16, 1996<br></i><hr><h2>Foster Facts</h2></center>
<P> 

[There 's something shy about the 1993 death of White House Counsel 
Vincent Foster. Could he have known too much about the scandals 
dogging the President?]
<P>
Investigative reporter Christopher Ruddy has identified numerous 
inconsistencies in the official investigations of Vincent Foster's so-called 
suicide. First, there was no suicide note. Then there was a suicide note, 
only it didn't actually mention suicide or bid farewell to family members. 
The 28 torn pieces of the note were found in a briefcase that had been 
searched at least once already, the note had no fingerprints on it, and 
three handwriting experts have declared it a forgery.
<P>
The condition of the body was odd, to say the least. Ruddy says two 
paramedics observed that the slain White House official appeared to be 
"ready for the coffin,'' with arms and legs neatly arranged and head facing 
straight up. There was less blood than might be expected "from a gunshot 
wound to a living person's head." There was no trace of soil on Foster's 
shoes, as there surely would have been had he walked through dense 
brush to the secluded spot where his-body was found. The FBI found 
carpet fibers all over Foster's clothing, but never bothered to determine 
where or why it had come into contact with carpeting.
<P>
The gun was found in Foster's hand, a rarity for suicides. Nevertheless, 
there were no fingerprints on the weapon, says Ruddy. Although Foster 
supposedly shot himself in the mouth, there was "no visible blood 
splatter" on the gun, the recoil did not "chip or damage teeth," and no 
gunpowder was found on his tongue. No one heard the fatal shot, and the 
fired bullet was "never found, despite exhaustive searches."
<P>
Ruddy says Park Police did not "bother to interview park neighbors or 
regular visitors." They failed to "take statements from all persons found 
in the park." They misrepresented the statement of at least one witness. 
They failed to seal Foster's office and "gave away key crime scene 
evidence, such as his beeper and papers, within hours of his death." They 
neglected to have the gun tested "until one week after" the death was 
ruled a suicide. All of the 35-millimeter crime scene photos have 
disappeared, as have seven Polaroids taken at the scene by a Park Police 
officer. The X-rays mentioned in the autopsy report are also missing.
<P>
During the first official investigation of the Foster death, a witness who 
discovered the body was allegedly badgered by- the FBI "to alter his 
testimony on critical issues." Ruddy says another witness charges that the 
FBI lied in claiming he "could not identify a man he saw in the park." 
Investigators simply ignored the statements of other witnesses "who said 
two men, not Foster, were in and around his car just before the body was 
found." The lead prosecutor in the second official probe "resigned after 
being thwarted" in his efforts to conduct a comprehensive investigation. 
Somebody pretty powerful must not want us to know what really 
happened to Vincent Foster.

<br>
January 17, 1996<br></i><hr><h2>Musical Madness</h2>
</center>
<P>
["Popular musical messages contribute to an increasingly violent and 
morally bankrupt society. "]
<P>
In a new report called Bringing Out the Worst in Us: The Frightening 
Truth About Violence, the Media, and Our Youth, Focus on the Family 
research manager Robert Waliszewski argues that "musical messages are 
capable of planting dangerous ideas in the minds of young people or 
fueling those which already exist." He provides samples of some of the 
more offensive rap and heavy-metal lyrics and cites documented accounts 
of the violent crimes they've inspired. Although there is much evidence 
that "a strong correlation exists between a steady diet of mayhem and the 
urge to act on it," Waliszewski concedes that "no one knows what the 
cumulative effect will be when a young person consumes a steady diet of 
violent music."
<P>
Musically inspired sexual assaults and murders are just the tip of the 
iceberg. "For every teenager who makes the 6 o'clock news by carrying 
out an act of violence, there are thousands more whose values are being 
fashioned subtly through disturbing musical messages," says 
Waliszewski. "They're learning that demeaning women is not only 
acceptable, but [even] preferable to treating women with respect. They're 
hearing accounts that glorify serial killers and praise drive-by shootings. 
They're being bombarded with the messages that parents and other 
authorities are not worthy of respect; that life revolves around drugs, 
money, and perverse forms of sexual activity -- to be obtained by force, if 
necessary."
<P>
The content of contemporary music is qualitatively different from that of 
even the recent past. "Three decades ago, not one popular song 
encouraged robbery, rape, murder, assaults, or using weapons to settle 
disputes," says Waliszewski. "In today's popular music, all these themes 
can be found -- and worse! Nothing is taboo. Unfortunately, America's 
streets and neighborhoods increasingly reflect this fact. What's more, 
since violent lyrics are a relatively new phenomenon, no one knows the 
results of raising a generation on this type of musical diet. In addition, 
teenagers have greater access to (and are listening to) far more music than 
they have in past generations." Waliszewski notes that, by the end of high 
school, the average teenager has listened to more than 10,000 hours of 
rock music.
<P>
Violent crime increased by over 500 percent during the three decades 
ending in 1990. There may be a host of factors contributing to this social 
pathology, but "violence in the media" is certainly one of them. "Music 
industry insiders often shirk responsibility by saying their music reflects 
society but does not impact it," Waliszewski observes. "Some music 
industry insiders have argued that, as performers and 'actors on the stage,' 
musicians cannot be held responsible for their fans' criminal behavior. 
Their anti-social messages are not to be taken seriously because...they 
don't actually mean what they say."  Such claims are disingenuous at best. 
Whether they know what they're doing or not, the purveyors of this 
madness should be held accountable for the damage they've done to an 
entire generation of young Americans.

<h2>Filth on Film</h2></center><P>

["By the time the average child leaves elementary school, he will have 
witnessed 8,000 murders and i00, 000 other acts of violence on TV."]
<P>
"TV, if used for responsible purposes, can have a positive impact," says 
Focus on the Family research manager Robert Waliszewski. "Yet, 
positive television is only a small portion of what America is watching. 
For many, the 'education' received from televised programming can have 
a detrimental effect." Waliszewski cites a 1993 report by the American 
Psychological Association that declared emphatically that "higher levels 
of viewing violence on television are correlated with increased 
acceptance of aggressive attitudes and increased aggressive behavior." 
Surveys of prison inmates imprisoned for violent crimes reveal that as 
many as a third "reported having consciously imitated criminal 
techniques learned from television pro ,rams."
<P>
In a new report called Bringing Out the Worst in Us: The Frightening 
Truth About Violence, the Media, and Our Youth, Waliszewski argues 
that "television's preoccupation with sex, violence, and sexualized 
violence would have been unthinkable in the minds of its early pioneers," 
adding that "public sentiment would not have embraced the likes of The 
Playboy Channel, MTV, Spice, HBO and Showtime." But ugliness and 
depravity are pervasive on television today, and "TV talk shows are just 
the tip of the iceberg. With its offering of offensive sitcoms, cartoons, 
made-for-TV-movies, film releases and graphic news footage, television 
has sunk to new lows."
<P>
Waliszewski warns that "television transmits values that are opposite to 
those being taught at home," forcing children "to choose which message 
to believe." Alarming increases in juvenile delinquency rates would seem 
to suggest that television is winning the values battle. "TV receives the 
lion's share of a young person's attention -- and does so in their most 
impressionable years," says Waliszewski. "By the time the average 
American child graduates [from] high school, he or she will have spent 
nearly 20,000 hours in front of a television" -- nearly twice the amount of 
time spent in school.
<P>
Much of the trash on television is recycled garbage from Hollywood. 
Waliszewski laments the passing of the Production Code, which 
discouraged directors from giving in to their baser instincts. "Since the 
days of silent movies, the power of a motion picture, with its potential to 
negatively impact society, has not gone unnoticed. For that reason, 
industry pioneers drafted a self-regulatory code of ethics in 1930 that 
governed the content of movies," prohibiting films that undermined the 
sanctity of home and marriage, disparaged the clergy, blasphemed, or in 
any way lowered the standards of viewers. That code has long since been 
abandoned.
<P>
Waliszewski concedes that "films do not 'cause' anyone to commit 
destructive acts. However, they can, and do, shape the values of the 
watchers." He notes that films like Natural Born Killers and Menace II 
Society have encouraged numerous impressionable viewers to imitate the 
unspeakable violence they glorified. But the ill effects don't end there. 
"For many undetermined others, their values were molded -- causing a 
desensitization toward violence and a loss of respect for society's laws 
and lawkeepers."

["Industry executives claim there is no conclusive evidence  
demonstrating that video game violence affects young people." Recent  
research, however, show that claim is false.] 
 <P>
"In 1990, the National Coalition on Television Violence found that nine  
of 12 research studies on the impact of violent video games on children  
and adolescents reported harmful effects," says Jerry Melchisedeck of  
Focus on the Family. In a new report called Bringing Out the Worst in  
Us: The Frightening Truth About Violence, the Media, and Our Youth,  
Melchisedeck cites research identifying "a short-term relationship  
between playing violent games and increased aggressive behavior in  
younger children." Other research suggests that "the ill effects of video  
games are worse than those of TV because children actively control the  
violence rather than passively view it. In other words, the more children  
practice violent acts, the more likely they are to perform violent acts." 
 <P>
Jerry Melchisedeck says one researcher "reported that 40 out of 47 top  
video games he surveyed centered on violence, and 13 of those contained  
subthemes that emphasized the idea of women as victims." That same  
researcher "concluded that there are no gray areas in the behavior of  
game characters, and that players are rarely required to reflect or make  
contextual judgments." The manufacturers and distributors of violent  
video games resort to the usual dodge to justify their poisonous products.  
They insist they're only giving the customers what they want. "If  
consumer demand is the industry's guiding principle," says Melchisedeck,  
"then the future of video and computer gaming holds products that are  
progressively violent and realistically three-dimensional." 
 <P>
The demand for increasing levels of "realism," if you can call it that, has  
ominous implications. Video games now outsell Hollywood films, and  
that has movie moguls murmuring. Hollywood's getting in on the action,  
developing "interactive" movies that allow gamers gorged on two- 
dimensional gore to immerse themselves in cinematic savagery. 
 <P>
The ability to "download" video games is one of the major appeals of the  
so-called Information Superhighway. Thirty million people worldwide  
are now hooked up to the Internet, and video games aren't the only non- 
educational diversion available to them. Electronic mail is another. E- 
mail allows for the uncensored global transfer of words; sound; artistic,  
photographic, and videographic images; and computer software.  
Pornographers and pedophiles are already exploiting the perverse  
possibilities. 
 <P>
"Like the public library, the Internet provides access to volumes of up-to- 
date facts and data," says Jerry Melchisedeck. "Millions use it in the same  
manner as previous generations have referenced hardbound  
encyclopedias. For some, however, the Internet is a means of propagating  
their obscene, often violent, inclinations under the guise of First  
Amendment freedom. Access to this disturbing fare is as easy as a click  
of a button." Melchisedeck warns that "parents must not look to the  
government to protect their children. They must take an active role in  
monitoring the types of information" that the Internet delivers directly  
into their homes.

<h2>Idahoans Lead Health Care Reform</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>"Can you name the two most progressive communities in America? When it comes to innovative approaches to health care, Jersey City, New Jersey and Ada County, Idaho are true trailblazers. </i></blockquote>
<P> 
In 1994, Jersey City, New Jersey became the first local government in 
America to offer its employees the health insurance option of Medical 
Savings Accounts (MSAs). Fewer than 200 of the city's nearly 3,000 
employees signed on at the outset, but even that small number saved Jersey 
City $21,000 in insurance premiums in the first three months that the plan 
was in use. In 1995, Ada County, Idaho followed suit with an MSA-based 
health insurance plan that County Commissioner Gary Glenn says was 
"designed to provide Ada County employees significantly enhanced health 
insurance coverage at a significantly reduced cost to the taxpayer." 
Roughly 170 out of 900 Ada County employees agreed to switch to MSAs, 
saving taxpayers $87,000 a year. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Providing enhanced coverage at a reduced cost may sound like "voodoo 
economics," but the explanation is simple. MSA plans pay 100 percent of a 
policyholder's health care expenses, but rely on a high deductible to keep 
costs down. The high-deductible policies are much cheaper than traditional 
low-deductible plans. Part of the money saved goes into Medical Savings 
Accounts set up for employees. Workers use the MSAs to pay their minor 
medical bills until they reach the deductible. Because policyholders get to 
keep whatever funds are left in their MSAs at the end of the year, they 
have a strong incentive to dicker with their doctors, to take better care 
of themselves, and to forgo unnecessary tests and treatment. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
An editorial in the Idaho Statesmen last summer described Medical Savings 
Accounts as "a great way to save money, promote lower overall health-care 
costs, and make consumers a more active and equal partner in the health 
equation." An MSA plan "can save money because it encourages workers to 
shop around. Bargain hunters can motivate hospitals and doctors to 
compete," said the newspaper. "As long as medical providers and insurance 
companies are running the show, consumers have little control over cost and 
little incentive to worry about it." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ada County Commissioner Gary Glenn thinks the Medical Savings Account is 
"the wave of the future" and takes pride in his county's status as "the 
second public employer in the nation to try this option." An MSA plan "puts 
the patient in charge," says Glenn, who insists that "Americans are as 
capable of making decisions about health care as they are about every other 
product and service they buy." Everyone's a winner with MSAs. "Taxpayers 
win because they will have to pay less to cover their public employees," 
says Glenn. "Employees win because they have the freedom to make their own 
healthcare decisions and maybe save some money in the process. And the 
country wins because it will bring down the cost of health care in 
general."

<title>Duplantier: Why America Must Cut Immigration -- 2/6/96</title>

<h2>Why America Must Cut Immigration </h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>"Immigration has been, and can continue to be, in the national interest -- 
if properly regulated." </i></blockquote>
<P> 
The United States issues 675,000 immigrant visas a year. Senator Alan 
Simpson of Wyoming thinks that's far too many. As chairman of the Senate 
Subcommittee on Immigration, Simpson has proposed cutting the number to 
540,000, a 20 percent reduction. "The first and most important reason [for 
reducing immigration] is that the American people desire it," says Simpson. 
If Congress fails to take the initiative on this matter, he argues, "the 
people in the states and local communities of this country will most surely 
take it into their own hands to make the badly needed changes." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reason the American people want a reduction in immigration is "to allow 
the historically high flow of immigrants who have entered in the past 
several years to assimilate, to learn English . . . and to become 
integrated into the American economy." Simpson says that Americans "want 
criminal aliens swiftly expelled from this country. They want assurances 
that immigrants will not become a burden on the public welfare system. They 
want to know that American workers, particularly workers and students just 
entering the job market, will have a fair chance at the jobs offered by 
American employers -- and that wages of U.S. workers will not be undercut 
by foreign workers overjoyed to receive a fraction of what Americans earn." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
With regard to the immigration of family members, Simpson argues that 
"those opportunities should be reserved for the 'nuclear family' of 
citizens and permanent residents." He argues that "our present policy of 
giving preference to more distant family members . . . leads to the entry 
of in-laws of in-laws and persons who have only the most distant kinship 
relationship to the original immigrants -- or even none at all." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Senator Simpson believes that it is in the national interest to "restrict 
the immigration of unskilled workers, those who would directly compete with 
American workers entering the job market as a result of new limitations on 
the use of public assistance." He contends that "responsible immigration 
reform must also consider the more than one-third of a million Americans" 
who lost their jobs in the past year. "Of particular concern," he says, 
"are Americans who are laid off only to see their former jobs lawfully 
performed by temporary foreign workers.'" 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Senator Alan Simpson's proposed legislation to revise immigration policy is 
based on the following common-sense principles: "Persons who are here 
illegally, particularly criminal aliens, should be quickly removed from the 
country through the reform of our detention and deportation process -- and 
while here should not be able to either work or obtain most forms of public 
assistance. Persons seeking to come legally should be swiftly united with 
their close family members in this country or . . . expeditiously and 
effectively screened so that they may take the jobs for which no qualified 
American is available. Finally, the overall number of immigrants should be 
reduced for at least five years."

<title>Duplantier: Feminists Ignore Successful Women  -- 2/8/96</title>

<h2>Feminists Ignore Successful Women </h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>More than six million American women own their own businesses. Yet, for 
some strange reason, you'll never hear a feminist trumpeting these 
triumphs. </i></blockquote>
<P> 
Feminists seem determined to "wave aside the achievements of the individual 
for the collectivist utopia of group success," says Elizabeth Larson in a 
recent issue of The Freeman, a monthly journal published by the Foundation 
for Economic Education. Larson argues that such feminist-supported policies 
as affirmative action are actually detrimental to women. "The American 
working woman pays a high price for the position or promotion she receives 
from affirmative action," says Larson, and that price is "the unspoken 
assumption that she was not the 'best man' for the job." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whether that assumption is warranted in a particular instance or not, the 
fact remains that affirmative action tends to make the qualifications of 
all women seem suspect -- with sad, but certain consequences. "Resentment 
against an individual case of hiring by quota ferments into resentment 
against all members of the privileged group," says Larson. Although 
affirmative action is supposed to remedy the effects of discrimination, in 
reality it only perpetuates it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Supporters of affirmative action for women play fast and loose with their 
figures. The so-called wage gap between men and women is "neither as wide 
nor as unbridgeable as it is portrayed," notes Larson. "Once you stop 
lumping all women of all ages in all fields together and using that 
resulting dollar figure as representative of the average American working 
woman, the gap narrows. Comparing the wages of women and men of the same 
age, with similar experience, training, and years of uninterrupted time in 
their field yields a much more optimistic picture of how women fare today." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Larson says "the gaps that do still exist are likely due to the fewer 
continuous years women have been in the workforce. Women who have never 
interrupted their careers for any reason now earn at least 98 percent as 
much as their male counterparts." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Larson contends that "many feminists labor under assumptions about the 
workplace and the meaning of success that are both unreasonable and 
unrealistic. They seem to believe that making an attempt at her job in and 
of itself guarantees a woman success." It's not that easy, says Larson. 
"Just because a woman wants to be the first female CEO of her company does 
not mean she is entitled to the position, or that if she fails to make it 
that far up the corporate ladder it is someone else's fault. Luck, drive, 
brains, connections, education, and, yes, good looks, can all play a part 
in the promotions any worker -- male, or female -- receives." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
There are many women who have "genuine, free-market success stories to 
tell," but you won't hear about them from feminists, because that would 
undercut their campaign for government intervention. "An eagerness to rely 
on the government," says Elizabeth Larson, "betrays a lack of confidence in 
women's abilities to achieve financial and personal independence."

<h2>Property Rights Are Under Attack!</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>Do Americans really own anything anymore, or is everything we possess just 
on loan to us from the federal government? </i></blockquote>
<P> 
"Mass confiscation [of personal property] has become politically 
fashionable," reports James Bovard in a recent issue of The Freeman, the 
monthly journal of the Foundation for Economic Education. "Politicians and 
the courts have created an overwhelming presumption in favor of the 
government's right to seize control over private land, private homes, 
boats, and cars, and even the cash in people's wallets." Bovard warns that 
government's power to seize private property "directly subjugates citizens 
to the capricious will" of public officials. And those officials don't need 
much of a pretext to justify their actions. Bovard says, "Thousands of 
American citizens are being stripped of their property on the basis of 
rumors and unsubstantiated assertions made by the government's confidential 
informants." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Is this the American way? Whatever happened to personal property rights and 
the presumption of innocence? How did we get to this state of affairs? 
"Beginning in 1970, Congress enacted legislation to permit government to 
seize property of Mafia organizations and big-time drug smugglers," 
explains Bovard. More forfeiture laws were enacted as the years went on, 
with the result that "federal agents can now seize private property under 
more than 200 different statutes. From 1985 to 1991, the number of federal 
seizures of property under asset forfeiture laws increased by 1500 
percent." Federal officials lost interest in crime lords and drug kingpins. 
"Unfortunately, the more forfeiture laws legislatures enacted, the less 
attention police seem to pay to major criminals," says Bovard. Today, the 
vast majority of citizens forfeiting their property to the federal 
government under drug laws "are never formally charged with any crime." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Bovard asserts that nowadays "the mere suspicion of a government official 
is sufficient proof to nullify all claims that a citizen legitimately owns 
his property." He notes that "forfeiture laws are turning some federal 
agents into the modern-day equivalent of horse thieves. Ranchers are being 
victimized by seizures based on allegations of violations of environmental 
laws." By confiscating the vehicles that ranchers use to earn their 
livelihood, federal agents effectively put them out of business. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
According to the Justice Department's 1992 annual report on asset seizures, 
"No property may be seized unless the government has probable cause to 
believe that it is subject to forfeiture." That sounds good in theory, says 
Bovard, but that's not the way it works. "In reality, government officials 
are seizing people's property based solely on 'hearsay' -- rumor and gossip 
-- from anonymous informants." Bovard considers it more than likely that 
some policemen have "invented anonymous informants to give them a pretext 
to take private property they covet." The old double standard comes into 
play here with a vengeance. "While government agents can use hearsay 
evidence to justify a seizure," says Bovard, "property owners are usually 
prohibited from offering hearsay evidence to support their claims."

<h2>Welfare Makes The Problem Worse</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>Welfare spending in New York City has exacerbated the Big Apple's 
monumental social problems. What's the solution? Surely not more spending!</i></blockquote>
<P> 

"Over the last 30 years, New York City and State have devoted an increasing 
share of their revenues to the most dysfunctional members of society," 
writes Heather MacDonald in the Winter issue of the Manhattan Institute's 
City Journal, "and now social service spending constitutes the largest 
share of both city and state budgets. Yet, as spending grew, so did the 
social problems that spending was supposed to solve." A reasonable person 
might have concluded that throwing more money at the problems would 
probably do more harm than good. The official response, however, was quite 
the opposite. "The government," notes MacDonald, "responding by adding more 
programs." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Heather MacDonald concludes that "New York City's enormous commitment to 
social welfare spending has not stemmed social breakdown." If anything, it 
has made matters worse. "Social service spending has sucked out of the 
private economy capital that could have been used to create jobs, the best 
mechanism for ending poverty," says MacDonald. "But, in response to 
inner-city poverty, welfare advocates call for further social service 
spending, thereby accelerating the flight of business from the city." In 
addition to stifling job creation, welfare programs also discourage the 
formation of traditional families -- which are also a time-tested means of 
overcoming poverty. "The two-parent family is all but extinct in some 
neighborhoods, rendered superfluous by welfare's subsidy for illegitimacy," 
says MacDonald. "The resulting increase in juvenile delinquency, truancy, 
and teen pregnancy brings in more social services, which in turn further 
erode the incentives for personal responsibility." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Social service programs "reward dysfunctional behavior and subordinate the 
well-being of children to dubious ideology," says MacDonald. "Families 
create sound individuals by imposing discipline and moral values on 
children. Even if a government program could do this, these programs do 
not; for years, imposing values has been anathema to social workers, who 
studiously avoid making judgments about the 'life-style choices' of their 
clients." MacDonald argues that social workers confuse "moral deficit with 
material need." The more irresponsible a person is, the more financial 
assistance he receives. "Just as the birth of illegitimate children 
provides the mother with an income, so will deplorable child-rearing bring 
her a benefit." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
These perverse incentives are the direct result of "contemporary social 
worker's refusal to make moral judgments," says Heather MacDonald. "Rather 
than taking children or adults away from destructive environments, the 
reigning service ethic dictates that they remain 'in the community' and 'in 
the family' for treatment." Such wishful thinking ignores the fact that 
"usually there is no real community to go back to. Treating a juvenile 
delinquent in the war-torn environment that produced him does not look like 
a recipe for success." MacDonald argues that, when social workers respond 
to "unsustainable ways of life" as though they were "short-term crises," 
their efforts are doomed to failure.

<title>Duplantier: Implications Of The VMI Court Case -- 2/15/96</title>

<h2>Implications Of The VMI Court Case </h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>A Supreme Court decision favoring Attorney General Janet Reno's Justice 
Department in the VMI sex-discrimination case could open up a can of worms. </i></blockquote>
<P> 
For the past 20 years, the Supreme Court has treated sex-discrimination 
cases differently from race-discrimination cases. In race cases, the Court 
applies "strict scrutiny," under the assumption that racial classifications 
are inherently "suspect" and unconstitutional (except, of course, when 
affirmative action is involved). Up till now, the Court has not considered 
gender discrimination to be inherently suspect and has applied what it 
calls "intermediate scrutiny" to cases of this nature. This standard seems 
to have worked well, and there is no evidence that this approach is either 
unworkable or unjust. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As part of its effort to force the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) to 
open its doors to women, the Justice Department under Attorney General 
Janet Reno has asked the Supreme Court to add sex to its list of "suspect 
classes," thereby requiring the Court to apply "strict scrutiny" when 
considering cases involving charges of sex discrimination. Applying strict 
scrutiny to the VMI case would lead not only to the sexual integration of 
VMI, but to the sexual integration of all single-sex colleges. The fact 
that most single-sex colleges are women's colleges poses a dilemma for 
feminists and other politically-correct types. Many have no problem 
advocating the forced integration of men's colleges, but recognize that 
applying such a policy even-handedly would mean the elimination of 
women-only colleges as well. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
A Court ruling that strict scrutiny must be applied in gender cases would 
invite lawsuits against every public and private institution in America 
that makes distinctions between men and women. The effect on U.S. Armed 
Forces would be revolutionary. Our military services now provide separate 
facilities for men and women. This would be a no-no under strict scrutiny. 
The strength and endurance standards for men and women in the military are 
now substantially different. How could this be justified under strict 
scrutiny? Leave and discharge policies are different for men and women, 
recognizing pregnancy as a circumstance to be given special consideration. 
Military regulations regarding clothing and personal appearance are 
different for the two sexes. Such distinctions would not be tolerated in an 
irrational world of coercive uniformity. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What about women's athletic programs at co-ed schools and colleges? Would 
they have to be merged with the men's programs? Would an equal number of 
boys and girls be required for every team? Would they have to share locker 
rooms and showers? Every such consideration raises the specter of a 
thousand lawsuits. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
If the Supreme Court decides to apply strict scrutiny in sex-discrimination 
cases, what will the impact be on homosexual issues such as military 
service, same-sex marriage, and adoption? Will prohibitions against 
government funding of abortion be considered sexist? We would not have to 
ask such questions if the Supreme Court could be trusted to resist the 
temptation of judicial activism.

<title>Duplantier: DEFENSE BILL VETO -- 2/19/96</title>

<h2>Defense Bill Veto</h2>
<blockquote>
<i>President Clinton has demonstrated his commitment to "peacemaking" 
in Bosnia. At the same time, however, he has rejected efforts to provide 
for the defense of the United States.</blockquote></i>

<P>
The federal government has no constitutional authority to intervene in 
the internal affairs of foreign nations. It does, however, have the 
constitutional responsibility to defend our own country against foreign 
attack. Nevertheless, as 1995 drew to a close, President Clinton 
committed our government to an unconstitutional intervention in Bosnia 
and then vetoed a bill that would have provided a much-needed missile 
defense for America.

The federal government has no constitutional authority to intervene in 
the internal affairs of foreign nations. It does, however, have the 
constitutional responsibility to defend our own country against foreign 
attack. Nevertheless, as 1995 drew to a close, President Clinton 
committed our government to an unconstitutional intervention in Bosnia 
and then vetoed a bill that would have provided a much-needed missile 
defense for America.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 1996 defense authorization bill vetoed by Clinton represented "a 
serious effort to end America's present, absolute vulnerability to missile 
attack," says Frank Gaffney of the Coalition to Defend America. The bill 
would have required that the entire United States be protected against 
missile attack by the year 2003. Clinton's objection to the bill was that it 
would have put American policy "on a collision course with the ABM 
Treaty." That's what it would have done, all right, and it's about time we 
abrogated an outmoded, ill-advised treaty with a country that no longer 
exists.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Bipartisan majorities on Capitol Hill recognize that the time has come 
for the American people to be protected against missile attacks from all 
quarters by deployed defensive systems," says Gaffney. "Mr. Clinton, on 
the other hand, believes the American people should not be protected by 
such systems, lest a 1972 treaty that effectively prohibits their 
deployment be jeopardized." This difference of opinion as to whether 
America should be defended or "deliberately left vulnerable, and perhaps 
exposed, to missile attack" could be a defining issue in the 1996 
presidential campaign.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Gaffney points out that vetoes of defense authorization bills helped 
decide two previous presidential contests. In 1978, President Jimmy 
Carter vetoed the Pentagon's fiscal 1979 authorization legislation 
because he thought it provided too much money for defense and because 
he objected to several of the projects it authorized. "Ronald Reagan was 
able to use this veto as a prime example of the differences between his 
determination to rebuild America's military and Mr. Carter's refusal to 
do so," recalls Gaffney. Giving that veto symbolic value contributed 
greatly to Reagan's election.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Then, in 1988, President Reagan vetoed the fiscal 1989 defense 
authorization bill on the grounds that it did not provide sufficient 
resources for defense and in particular for anti-missile systems," says 
Gaffney. "This action once again showcased differences between 
Democrats (who then controlled Congress) and Republicans on security 
policy, contributing to the sound drubbing Vice President George Bush 
gave Michael Dukakis in the '88 election."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Bill Clinton's veto of the 1996 defense authorization bill could help 
decide the outcome of the 1996 presidential election, says Gaffney, 
provided the Republican candidates "make the most of it by clearly 
establishing that, if elected, one of their first orders of business will be the prompt deployment of U.S. missile defenses."

<title>Duplantier: MARDI GRAS -- 2/20/96</title>

<h2>Mardi Gras</h2>


<i><blockquote>
Today is Mardi Gras in New Orleans. As tractors tow the papier-mache 
and crepe-covered floats of the Rex parade down oak-lined St. Charles 
Avenue to Canal Street, parade-goers of all ages will shout their 
traditional plea to the trinket-laden riders: "Throw me something, 
Mister!"
</blockquote></i>

<P>
Everyone's a beggar on Carnival Day in New Orleans, pandering for 
handouts that come in the form of cast-metal doubloons, strings of 
multicolored beads, and oversized plastic cigars, toothbrushes and other 
oddities. It's a day of self-indulgence, and it's all in fun, but it takes 
hundreds of well-trained policemen, posted at every corner of the six-
mile parade route, to keep the merriment from getting out of hand. As 
much as New Orleanians love their Mardi Gras, you'd be hardpressed to 
find anyone who isn't glad to see it end on Ash Wednesday, the 
beginning of Lent.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Imagine people hanging out in the streets all year long waiting for 
someone to toss them a few freebies, having nothing better to do in the 
meantime other than look for ways to get into trouble. A single day of 
community-wide excess may serve as a relief valve for the pressures that 
build up during the year, but socially-sanctioned self-indulgence on a 
continuing basis makes no sense at all. Yet, that's just what we have with 
our federal welfare system.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation argues that welfare "reduces 
work effort and promotes illegitimacy and poverty-prone single-parent 
families." The government dole is "extremely efficient at replacing self-
sufficiency with dependence, but relatively ineffective in raising incomes 
and eliminating poverty." Welfare is especially detrimental to children -- 
increasing the dropout rate and the unwed pregnancy and delinquency 
rates, and reducing longterm earning potential.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Foreign aid is nothing more than international welfare -- a global, year-
long Carnival -- and the effects are just as harmful. "Not only has the 
U.S. foreign aid program failed to promote economic growth in less 
developed countries, but many recipient countries are worse off because 
of it," say Bryan Johnson and Thomas Sheehy, also of the Heritage 
Foundation. They argue that, "instead of helping poor countries lift 
themselves out of poverty, aid often impedes their economic growth 
while damaging their fragile economies."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Maybe it's time the federal government took a tip from the City of New 
Orleans. If the politicians in Washington are determined to continue 
offering handouts and encouraging self-destructive behavior, let them 
confine this madness to a single day of the year. Let all the recipients of 
government largesse -- from individual entitlements to corporate 
subsidies to foreign aid -- gather in Washington for an annual one-day 
blowout. Let them jockey for position along the streets of the nation's 
capital as they wait for costumed congressmen to roll past on decorated 
floats. Let them all scream "Throw me something, Mister!" at the top of 
their lungs and fight among themselves for the goodies tossed their way. 
Then they can go home and behave themselves for the rest of the year.

<h2>Crime Decline</h2>


<i><blockquote>
It's an article of faith among liberals that prison sentences are no 
deterrent to criminal behavior, but statistics prove that would-be 
lawbreakers do consider the likelihood of punishment before resorting to 
crime.</blockquote></i>

<P>
Attorney Bruce Fein reports that "punishing and stigmatizing criminals 
is working. Violent crime is tumbling as prison populations swell, chain 
gangs are returning for serious offenders, three-time felons confront 
mandatory life sentences, juveniles are treated as adults for the 
commission of murderous crimes, shame is a growing feature of novel 
punishments, and parole is falling into disrepute."


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That's the good news, says Fein, in a recent Washington Times editorial. 
"The bad news is that the mass media and so-called penal experts are 
generally displaying fierce resistance to the good news." They don't want 
to relinquish their moral superiority. They can't bear to admit that the 
soft-hearted and fuzzy-headed policies they supported for so many years 
were monumental failures. They refuse to concede that common sense 
really does work. Fein says these superior beings are infatuated with 
rehabilitation programs and committed to fighting "the alleged 'root' 
causes of crime, i.e., poverty, unemployment, malparenting, ill 
education, and discrimination." Ideology keeps them from 
"acknowledging the obvious" and forces them to resort to 
"unconstructive whining" over get-tough policies.


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Bruce Fein concedes that "violent crime remains intolerably high." But 
the recent decline is "a welcome relief" from the skyrocketing rates of the 
1960s and 1970s. "During those Great Society decades, treatment and 
rehabilitation were [misrepresented] as inexpensive and enlightened 
answers to crime, and criminal behavior was generally blamed on 
societal ills or psychiatric ailments." Fein contends that these misguided 
notions led to lighter sentences for convicted felons, and that such 
leniency served only to embolden the criminally inclined. Gradually, this 
sentimentalized view of the criminal as victim infected the general 
population, undermining the "cultural deterrence of crime" as manifested 
by "ostracism or community debasement of criminals for choosing evil." 
Fein says that such social penalties have a tremendous impact on crime 
and cites Japan as a nation where they continue to be used effectively.


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But stiff sentences and societal condemnation are making a comeback. 
"Unforgiving prison terms for felons work to reduce crime because an 
enormous proportion is attributable to recidivism," says Fein. Needless to 
say, repeat offenders commit no crimes while incarcerated. The longer 
they stay in prison, the fewer crimes they commit. Holding criminals 
responsible for their own behavior is back in style. Fading fast is the idea 
that criminals "deserved indulgence and sympathy because their 
depravity was engendered by societal wrongs or imperfections, or the 
happenstance of environmental factors."


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fein argues that the "community devastation wrought by such imbecility 
concentrated the minds of ordinary citizens, legislatures, and judges 
wonderfully. No longer are criminals viewed as victims of fate," he says, 
"but as evil creatures who have chosen to indulge their anti-social vices 
and passions; they should be shamed and disgraced."

<h2>Love Canal</h2>


<i><blockquote>
At a recent press conference announcing that the Occidental Chemical 
Corporation had agreed to pay $129 million to clean up toxic waste at 
Love Canal, Attorney General Janet Reno observed that it was only fair 
to expect people to clean up their own mess. She neglected to mention, 
however, that government played a major role in creating this particular 
mess.

</blockquote></i>

<P>
Everyone knows that Occidental's predecessor company, Hooker 
Chemicals & Plastics, buried toxic waste at Love Canal more than 40 
years ago. What they don't know, says Michael Fumento of the 
Competitive Enterprise Institute, is that "Hooker tried desperately to 
convince the city of Niagara Falls (where Love Canal is located) not to 
build on the site." Citing a 1981 article in Reason magazine, Furnento 
recounts how the Niagara Falls school board "applied massive pressure 
to obtain the land despite Hooker's repeated warnings of potential health 
hazards. Finally, Hooker gave in and sold the land for a symbolic dollar 
bill. It insisted, though, that the land . . . was under no circumstances to 
be excavated."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Niagara Falls ignored that stipulation. "Instead, the city decided to build 
a housing development on the site.... Then it sold the plots to 
unsuspecting home buyers." The fact is that Hooker did not endanger the 
public when it dumped its waste in an undeveloped area. "It was the 
city's choice to bring people" to that location, says Fumento. "The bad 
guy wasn't the big faceless corporation; it was your friendly city 
government."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fumento notes that "nobody at Love Canal complained of any 
exceptional illnesses until a muckraking environmental reporter for the 
local paper began a series of articles telling the people that they were 
sitting on a toxic waste site." Then a feeding frenzy began. "The media 
descended on the town and relayed to the outside world every sneeze, 
every cough, and every ache and pain experienced by Love Canal 
residents, making it clear that they could only be caused by toxic waste." 
Bureaucrats and politicians saw an opportunity to grandstand. "The EPA 
and the governor of New York swaggered around, condemning the 
chemical company and promising to make everything better, no matter 
the cost. Ultimately, tens of millions of dollars were spent evacuating the 
residents."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fumento reports that subsequent studies by state and federal agencies 
"found that Love Canal residents had no more illnesses than would be 
expected in any other area of similar size." Attorney General Janet Reno 
neglected to mention this at the news conference, possibly because more 
than $100 million of the Occidental settlement is going to be 
Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund, which was created in the 
wake of Love Canal hysteria. EPA Administrator Carol Browner used 
the occasion to warn that "Congress is attempting to roll back the 
environmental health protections that Superfund brought to Love Canal." 
That contention is easily refuted, says Fumento. "Since there was never 
any health threat at the Love Canal, obviously Superfund brought no 
protection there."

<h2>Space Academy</h2>


<i><blockquote>
Some day in the not too distant future, you may get to watch your child 
or grandchild graduate from the U.S. Space Academy. On that proud 
day, you can both thank Lt. General Daniel Graham for making that 
opportunity possible.

</blockquote></i>

<P>
Lt. General Daniel Graham had become convinced towards the end of 
his life that U.S. space policy "needed fundamental overhaul. Space had 
become a ravenous consumer of resources when it should have become a 
source of national wealth and a bastion of national security," he 
lamented in his autobiography, Confessions of a Cold Warrior Graham 
recognized that new and emerging technology could "make the 
taxpayers' space investments provide a substantial return," if only the 
government could be persuaded to "open space to the general public and 
the private sector." Advances in technology had "removed the principal 
constraints on the pursuit of practical goals in space, and enabled both 
commercial and government programs that would be well-supported by 
the public."


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The commercial exploitation of space is no longer just a dream. If 
Americans want to capitalize on the boundless possibilities, however, we 
must plan accordingly. "No U.S. space policy, however well-formulated, 
can bear fruit without attention to the people who will be called upon to 
carry out the policy," General Graham warned. "Space efforts require a 
constant input of bright and properly educated young people into those 
sectors of government, industry and commerce that deal with space."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Graham knew that generating "enthusiasm for space among young 
people" would be simple enough. "They want to be a part of the grand 
adventure of space activity," he observed. "But, beyond getting them 
excited, we have little advice to give them about how to realize their 
dreams except to advise excelling in one or another hard-science 
discipline." Graham's visionary solution was "a Space Academy along 
the lines of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy where young 
Americans, and perhaps youngsters from other lands, could be steeped in 
the disciplines pertinent to space. They could be graduated with a 
bachelor's degree in space science, ready for employment in the 
aerospace industry, commercial space enterprises, or government civil 
and military space programs."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
General Graham envisioned a comprehensive program of space 
scholarship, including disciplines such as "space medicine, space law, 
space diplomacy, space construction, and space literature." He saw "no 
difficulty whatever in establishing a space-oriented curriculum for the 
cadets of a Space Academy meeting all necessary criteria for the 
granting of degrees." He also knew that "the standards for entry into 
such an academy could be set very high and still not accommodate all 
young people who would apply and qualify. A student body with 
computer literacy, technical aptitude, physical fitness and high personal 
standards would be easily assembled, as well as a competent, highly 
motivated faculty." General Graham predicted that "graduates of such a 
Space Academy would be in great demand, and the aspirations of young 
people interested in a career in space-related activity could be channeled 
effectively."

<h2>Organized Crime</h2>


<i><blockquote>
"The face of organized crime in America is dramatically changing. " 
The challenge is to defend ourselves against it without giving up the 
freedoms we hold dear.

</blockquote></i>

<P>
"In the 1980s, the government began cracking down on organized 
crime," reports Robert McGarvey in the February issue of the American 
Legion magazine. The results were nothing short of spectacular. 
"Nowadays, the chiefs of the American Mafia . . . are languishing in 
prison, leaving the organizations they left behind in disarray." Their 
sudden departure created an equal employment opportunity for other 
minority gangsters, however, and "literally dozens of ethnic crime 
groups have emerged to fill the void." McGarvey reports that 
"Colombian drug barons earn billions of dollars annually in the United 
States. Japanese gangsters . . . claim a mounting presence in Hawaii, 
along with scattered outposts on the West Coast. Various Mexican 
criminals . . . wreak havoc in U.S. border states."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most menacing of all are the Triad gang of Hong Kong and the so-called 
Russian Mafia. "The Triads' business is heroin," says McGarvey. "Some 
60 percent of the drugs entering the United States are traced to Triad 
sources, primarily Burmese poppy fields that have long been controlled 
by Chinese criminals." The Triads have not neglected to diversify, 
however. Their other interests, according to McGarvey, include 
"extortion, prostitution, international car theft, and their much-
publicized involvement in alien smuggling," the latter netting them more 
than $3 billion a year. McGarvey warns that "the Triads are building 
alliances with U.S. street gangs," whose teenaged members "represent a 
sizable, often coldblooded army that will take on even the most vicious 
jobs."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Russian Mafia, composed of former KGB officers and various gulag 
graduates, "now ranks as one of law enforcement's top priorities," says 
McGarvey. A deputy assistant FBI director recently told Congress that 
the Russian Mafia may soon be "the principal organized crime group in 
the United States." He warns that its members are extremely violent and 
have already linked up with Italian and Colombian comrades in crime. 
The FBI's New York bureau chief reports that he has "transferred agents 
and other scarce resources out of traditional organized crime 
investigations and foreign counterintelligence to concentrate on Russian 
crime."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
McGarvey asserts that "America's new Russian gangsters also rank as 
perhaps the nation's most versatile criminals." He says that "the most 
fearsome aspect of the Russian Mafia is its access to the ill-guarded 
military warehouses of the old USSR. This makes the 'Moscow mob' 
instant leaders on the international arms black market, where they sell 
everything from automatic weapons to rocket launchers. Russian thugs 
even are alleged to be dealing in weapons-grade radioactive materiel."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
McGarvey worries that "U.S. law enforcement currently is ill-equipped 
to battle groups like the Triads and the Russian Mafia." We should be 
concerned about the damage to our society from "corruption, violence, 
and wholesale theft," but we should never sacrifice our democratic 
freedoms in the fight against internal enemies.

<title>Duplantier: UNION TACTICS -- 2/27/96</title>

<h2>Union Tactics</h2>


<i><blockquote>
"The purpose of all cartels is to raise prices above competitive levels and 
to redistribute income from consumers to cartel members. When unions 
successfully raise the price of labor above free-market levels, much of the 
employers' higher labor costs are passed on to consumers."
</blockquote></i>

<P>
Trade unions have often been described as "cartels of workers which 
collude to push their wages above free-market levels," observes Thomas 
DiLorenzo in a recent issue of The Freeman, the monthly journal of the 
Foundation for Economic Education. "Competition and the entry of new 
(and lower-priced) competitors are the bane of all cartels." That's why 
unions strive "to block competition from nonunion workers through 
special-interest legislation and regulation, and by committing acts of 
violence and intimidation against nonunion workers."


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Warehouse clubs, hypermarkets, and nonunion chains make grocery 
union organizers see red. The avowed objective of these organizers is "to 
either raise the prices of nonunion grocery stores or drive those stores 
into bankruptcy." DiLorenzo observes that "driving one's competitors out 
of business may be good for aspiring monopolists, but is bad for 
consumers and those workers" whose companies are targeted for 
destruction. "Low-income Americans will be hurt the most, as they 
always are when prices rise." With their typically low profit margins, 
grocery chains are especially vulnerable to "union harassment 
campaigns."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The preferred tactic among grocery union organizers is pressuring a 
company "to accept a union without ever permitting its employees to vote 
on whether or not they want a union," says DiLorenzo. "This is a stark 
admission that, at least in the grocery industry, unionization cannot 
succeed if employees are allowed to vote on whether or not they want a 
union. Extortion has replaced organizing." Unable to win a fair election, 
union organizers "intimidate and threaten to extort employers until they 
sign a contract with the union without holding a union certification 
election."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
DiLorenzo contends that the "flexible labor relations" essential to a 
company's efficiency are "rarely -- if ever -- found in unionized firms. 
Rigid job descriptions and restrictive work practices ratchet up costs and 
prices at unionized grocery chains, all to the detriment of the consumer. 
These higher costs and prices also threaten the job security of unionized 
employees who work for uncompetitive businesses."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The American workplace is "awash in regulations, most of which are 
impossible for mere humans to understand, let alone comply with." 
Unions have "taken advantage of this fact to impose regulatory costs on 
nonunion firms." DiLorenzo says that "regulation is so out of control that 
any business person in America, at any one time, is most certainly 
'guilty' of noncompliance with at least some regulations." He charges 
that unions "use regulation as a tool for extorting 'concessions' from 
nonunion employers, [including] recognition of the union without a 
representation election." DiLorenzo concludes that "deregulation of labor 
relations -- and of the economy in general -- is sorely needed if the 
American economy is to prosper."

<h2>Demise of the Home Economy
</h2>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
The industrial revolution created material prosperity in America, but in 
the process it also destroyed the traditional household economy. Did we 
lose more than we gained?
</I></blockquote>
<P>

"Before 1840, the vast majority of Americans -- over 90 percent -- lived 
on farms or in small villages: the life of the cottage," observes Allan 
Carlson of the Rockford Institute in the February issue of The Family in 
America. "While many adults had a specialized trade, most households 
aimed at -- and commonly achieved -- self-sufficiency in food, clothing, 
and other essentials." Children were an integral part of this home-based 
economy. "By age five, children were active participants in the work of 
the household, as were elderly or unmarried kin. Husbands and wives 
were bound together in a partnership of home-centered work," notes 
Carlson. "Family loyalties rested not only on love and emotional 
companionship, but also on need: wife and husband, child and parent 
were intertwined."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Carlson contends that this traditional home-based economy "began to 
change, about 1840, as industrialists harnessed the logic of the division 
of labor to the steam engine and to finance capital. The results included 
a considerable increase in productive efficiency; an accelerated output of 
goods such as wheels, shoes, and clothing; and a sharp lowering of their 
costs relative to the work of cobblers, tailors, smiths, and other displaced 
craftsmen. Decentralized, small, family-held enterprises gave way to 
large, centralized, joint-stock, limited-liability firms."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps most important, this dramatic change was what made high taxes 
and Big Government possible. "Although families could now purchase 
an array of cheaper consumer goods, the price this new freedom exacted 
was the surrender of productive family functions such as candlemaking, 
food processing, and weaving to the industrial sphere. It also meant 
moving the family production of goods, normally uncounted, into a cash 
nexus, where it would be counted and transformed into profit (and, later, 
into taxes as well)." Carlson charges that "the immediate interest of 
employers lay in keeping wages low and the pool of potential workers 
large. Wives, husbands, and children competed against each other in the 
sale of their labor, driving wages downward, to the level of individual 
subsistence."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The stifling of the productivity of the home had drastic ramifications. "In 
this new order, the home became separated from the factory and the 
office, a revolutionary shift in living patterns. People now worked in one 
place . . . and slept in another," Carlson observes. "With mothers and 
fathers pulled out of the 'cottage,' the care of children became a social 
question; again, something altogether new in human affairs. Time for 
tending the cottage garden or the family cow disappeared, and families 
were forced to enter the market to buy all of their food. In general terms, 
the ownership of productive property such as land and tools gave way to 
a reliance on cash wages and factory-produced goods. Economic loyalties 
were no longer rooted in family relationships, but increasingly owed to 
the employing firm."

<h2>
Revival of the Home Economy
</h2>


<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>More than a million American children are now schooled at home. If 
present trends continue, homeschooling may one day become the 
preferred method of education in America, as it was before 1840.</I></BLOCKQUOTE><p>

The modern social-welfare state arose in the hundred years between 
1840 and 1940, assuming "nurturing functions that had throughout 
human history belonged to the family. The first and most important of 
these was education," writes Allan Carlson of the Rockford Institute in 
the February issue of The Family in America. "Beginning in the 1840s, 
in the same time and place as early industrialization, the common school 
movement, backed by compulsory education laws, took children out of 
the home for moral and practical training."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The social-welfare state soon "captured other family functions as well," 
says Carlson. "Reform schools, the 'child saving' movement, the 
juvenile-justice system, and the vast child abuse and neglect apparatus 
all grew." Even child labor laws "further expanded the modern state's 
socialization of children's time." State-funded pension programs "erased 
other basic features of the family economy: security between the 
generations and care of the ill and infirm. Until modern times, grown 
children and other relatives provided security and support to elderly 
persons, particularly the indigent and the invalid. Adults bore an 
obligation, moral as well as social and legal, to care for their own; they 
also knew that their security might depend someday on the children they 
had reared and on the example they had set in giving care to their own 
parents. New systems of state pensions and health insurance shattered 
these security bonds between the generations of a family."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Allan Carlson contends that the growing homeschooling movement 
began in the 1970s as a reaction to "specific events -- federal efforts to 
regulate public and parochial education, Supreme Court decisions 
blessing the sexual revolution, the breakdown of discipline and standards 
in local schools, the appearance of books . . . encouraging a radical break 
with existing patterns of learning." These events, he says, "inspired a 
critical mass of pioneers to bring their children home. They soon 
discovered that, indeed, there's no place like home for the education of 
their children. These pioneer families also found that the nature of their 
family relationships changed, almost overnight. No longer mere 
consumers sharing the same roof and television set, they had become 
members of a learning enterprise who needed each other and who 
profited -- morally and practically -- from each other."


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The pioneers of homeschooling made other pleasant discoveries. "Most 
of these families began to find ways to bring other functions home as 
well -- gardening, food preservation, or a family business -- and they 
tasted the satisfactions of an independence unknown to several American 
generations." Carlson argues that homeschooling "is the most promising 
effort at family institutional reconstruction undertaken in America 
during the last 150 years. The family, born to and naturally residing in 
the symbolic 'cottage,' then uprooted and ravaged by factory and state, 
has found a path back to its true home."

<h2>
Origins of the Income Tax 
</h2>


<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>

We've heard a lot of talk in recent months 
about the many benefits of 
the flat-rate income tax, but we rarely hear anything about the marvelous 
federal income tax we used to have -- none at all!

</I></BLOCKQUOTE><p>



In 1862, the year preceding his famous Emancipation Proclamation, 
President Abraham Lincoln inaugurated America's first income tax law, 
styling it an "excise tax" to circumvent the prohibition against direct 
taxation found in Article I, Section 9 of the United States Constitution. 
Within two years he had opted for a graduated income tax, summarily 
rejecting the principle of equality under the law which had prevailed in 
America until that time. It was only as a temporary measure that 
Lincoln's income tax achieved passage. Despite efforts to extend it, the 
tax lapsed in 1872, two years after its prescribed expiration. But the 
appetite of politicians and their bosses for an unlimited source of revenue 
and power had been whetted, and the freedom that Americans had 
enjoyed for less than a century would soon be imperiled again.


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt sought unsuccessfully to have 
Congress enact an income tax law. In the first year of the administration 
that followed, however, President William Howard Taft acquiesced in 
the passage of a tariff bill with a rider providing for the taxation of 
corporation incomes. He also agreed to a resolution calling for a 
constitutional amendment to establish an income tax. On February 
3,1913, the State Department certified 38 states as having ratified the 
amendment. Only 36 of the 48 states then in the union were needed for 
ratification, but in recent years scholars have discovered evidence that no 
more than 27 states ratified the amendment in the prescribed manner. 
Properly ratified or not, the Sixteenth Amendment has had the full force 
of law for more than 80 years now. Indeed, this assault on the very 
liberties that the Constitution was designed to safeguard has been 
enforced more zealously than any law, constitutional or statutory, in all 
of American history.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The Sixteenth Amendment empowered the federal government "to lay 
and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without 
apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any 
census or enumeration." It also had the effect of diminishing at least 
three of the rights guaranteed by previous amendments to the 
Constitution: the right to due process in the Fifth Amendment; the right 
of the States and the people to retain all powers not expressly delegated 
to the Federal Government in the Tenth Amendment, and the right to be 
free from involuntary servitude, as protected by the Thirteenth 
Amendment.



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



Flat tax advocates abound nowadays, but it's hard to find any supporters 
of the tax system our Founding Fathers devised. Why is that? Could it be 
that powerful groups in our society have a vested interest in maintaining 
the peculiar institution of the income tax?

<title>Duplantier: "Conservative" Clinton  -- 03/04/96</title>

<h2>
Conservative Clinton
</h2>

<P>  
<blockquote><i>"The era of big government is over. We know big government does not have all the answers. There is not a program for every problem."</i></blockquote> 
<P>
  
Who was that man who gave the 1996 State of the Union address? He  
looked like Bill Clinton, but he sounded like Ronald Reagan -- until he got  
down to particulars. Then the New Democrat turned back into an Old  
Democrat, and we found out that the era of big government isn't over after  
all, but just playing possum. President Clinton thinks that big government  
still has all the answers, and a program for every problem. Unfortunately,  
the answers are wrong, and the programs just make the problems worse. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;President Clinton still wants to socialize the health care industry -- the  
biggest big-government power grab in decades! In a fit of false  
compassion, he would force actuaries to ignore the hard reality of risk and  
insure the uninsurable, thereby bankrupting yet another vital American  
industry. The President wants to expand federal authority by calling for  
"community partnerships with local police forces" and the investigation of  
local gangs by federal agencies. He declared that "we must end the deadly  
scourge of domestic violence." But whom did he mean by we? Big  
government, of course. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The President insisted that "every classroom in America must be connected  
to the information superhighway, with computers, good software, and well- 
trained teachers." But who's going to do the connecting? And who's going  
to pay for this "technology initiative"? Why, a "national partnership," of  
course. That's another pretext for federal intervention in areas reserved to  
the states by our U.S. Constitution! Clinton wants local schools to adopt  
"national standards," but the federal government has neither the authority  
to establish such standards, nor the integrity to resist politicizing them.  
Clinton called for more federal spending for his national service program,  
cash grants to top high school graduates, expansion of the student loan  
program, and a so-called "GI Bill for America's Workers." That doesn't  
sound like cutting back big government. 
 

 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



President Clinton also called for more taxpayer spending for "drug  
education," even though the $2 billion of federal funds squandered so far  
have had no measurable impact on drug abuse. He asserted that all schools  
should teach "character education: good values and good citizenship." Will  
the federal government establish national character standards, too? Will  
these standards be as far removed from right reason and reality as were the  
outrageous U.S. History Standards? Doesn't Bill Clinton know that the best  
way to teach values is by example? The President even went so far as to  
recommend uniforms for schoolchildren. The era of big government is  
clearly not over when the nation's chief executive officer is preoccupied  
with such local concerns. 
 

 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



No, the era of big government is not over yet, but the era of defending it  
certainly is. Bill Clinton's desperate bid to recast himself as a conservative  
is a tacit admission that liberalism is philosophically bankrupt.

<h2> Reading Experts Speak Out 
</h2>


<P><blockquote><i> When the Massachusetts Commissioner of Education invited public  
comment on proposed curriculum reforms for state schools, he did not  
anticipate a critique from 40 of the nation's top linguistic experts. 
</i></blockquote><P> 

Last July, Massachusetts Commissioner of Education Dr. Robert Antonucci  
received a letter signed by 40 linguistic experts, expressing their dismay  
that the state's new standards for the teaching of reading in public schools  
give an uncritical endorsement to the Whole Language method. In a cover  
letter, linguistics professor David Pesetsky and neurologist Dr. Janis  
Melvold identified themselves and their 38 co-signers as "experts on  
language and reading" hailing from "seven Massachusetts institutions,"  
their ranks including "three members of the National Academy of  
Sciences, four presidents of the Linguistic Society of America, three  
directors of major research training programs, and the authors of two of the  
leading books on language for the general public." 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Pesetsky and Melvold pointed out that the Whole Language approach is  
"widely blamed for serious declines in reading achievement" in other  
states, and speculated that "the recent decline in Massachusetts could be  
connected to the increased use of Whole Language methodology." They  
warned that the proposed new standards "point in exactly the wrong  
direction -- away from a curriculum that takes linguistic realities into  
account, and towards methods that have failed elsewhere." 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Pesetsky and Melvold offered Dr. Antonucci a brief introduction to reading  
theory. "Written language is a way of notating speech," they explained in  
their letter to the education commissioner. "To become a skilled reader, a  
learner must master this notation system, learning how the sounds and oral  
gestures of language correspond to letters and letter groups." In other  
words, a mastery of phonics is "fundamental to reading." The state's  
proposed new standards, however, downplay the importance of phonics,  
encourage unproven "strategies" such as guessing, and reject systematic  
instruction. In this respect, they "closely mirror the popular but  
increasingly criticized approach known as 'Whole Language.'"

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The accompanying letter, signed by all 40 linguistic experts, challenged  
the "scientifically unfounded views of language" that characterize the new  
standards for reading instruction. These nationally recognized "experts on  
language and reading" charged that "the common-sense view of reading as  
the decoding of notated speech" was being rejected in favor of "a surprising  
view of reading as directly 'constructing meaning." "The importance of  
'decoding' was being played down in favor of strategies such as contextual  
guessing." Such an approach ignores "the most important property of  
written English," the alphabet! 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



 
The experts insisted that "the view of language research" manifested in the  
proposed reforms "is inaccurate." They expressed their dismay that the  
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, in setting school standards, would  
"presume to legislate an erroneous view of how human language works, a  
view that runs counter to most of the major scientific results of more than  
100 years of linguistics and psycholinguistics. We are even more  
concerned," they added, "that uninformed thinking about language should  
lie at the heart of a 'standards' document for Massachusetts schools."

<h2>
Broadcasting for Freedom
</h2>



<P>  <blockquote><i>

 
The Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and Radio Liberty were  
instrumental in the collapse of Communism in Europe. So, why aren't we  
broadcasting the blessings of  liberty to the Communist countries of East  
Asia? 
 

</i></blockquote><P>


Lech Walensa and other veterans of the fight against Communist  
oppression in Eastern Europe have testified to the tremendous contribution  
that Radio Free Europe made to their struggle. Radio Free Europe's impact  
on the rise of the Solidarity union in Poland "cannot even be described,"  
said Walensa in a 1989 interview. "Would there be earth without the sun?"  
he asked rhetorically. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 
"Broadcasting can be one of the most effective and economical components  
of America's diplomatic and military efforts," says James Tyson, president  
of the Council for the Defense of Freedom. The $350 million currently  
allotted for the U.S. government's foreign broadcasting effort is a small  
fraction of the $250 billion annual defense budget. Ironically, the Voice of  
America, Radio Free Europe, and Radio Liberty were so effective in  
bringing the message of freedom to the captive nations of the world that  
many of our elected of officials have concluded that they are no longer  
necessary. "Following the collapse of communism in Europe, Radio Free  
Europe and Radio Liberty have been drastically downsized," says Tyson.  
The rush to cut back on such effective programs may prove to have been  
premature, especially if the resurgence of hardliners in Russia continues  
unchecked. "It is unfortunate," he says, "that Radio Liberty is becoming  
ineffective" just as Russia may be slipping back into dictatorship. 
 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



Even if the situation in Russia does stabilize, there will still be 1.4 billion  
people suffering under brutal Communist governments in China, North  
Korea, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Tyson argues that our broadcasting  
efforts should be focused on the Far East. "China is the largest and most  
dangerous nation in the world today," he observes. "More than a million  
people are confined in its slave labor camps. With its massive increase in  
arms -- including long-range missiles and atomic, chemical, and biological  
weapons -- the regime represents a threat to all its neighbors." Tyson says  
recent emigres report a growing hunger among the common people in  
China for accurate news about what is really going on in their own  
country. 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



 
A proposal to establish a Radio Free Asia broadcasting service was under  
consideration for several years, says Tyson, who served in 1992 on the  
Presidential Commission on Broadcasting to Asia. But it wasn't until 1995  
that Congress finally appropriated $10 million in start-up funds. Tyson  
contends that Radio Free Asia is "one of the most cost-effective policies we  
could follow," and estimates that an annual budget of $30 million would be  
sufficient to sustain the service. This would be money well spent. "If Radio  
Free Asia could accelerate the democratization of China as Radio Free  
Europe and Radio Liberty did in the Soviet bloc," says Tyson, "it would  
result in huge savings in our defense budget."

<h2>
Religion in America
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i> Millions of Americans are enjoying better health and happier lives than  
they ever imagined, and you can too, once you know the secret. </i></blockquote>
<P> 

Are you suffering from high blood pressure? Does someone in your family  
show signs of depression or substance abuse? Has the fire gone out of your  
married life? Don't despair. Now there's a fast, safe, and simple way to  
overcome these problems -- and it won't cost you an arm and a leg. Sound  
too good to be true? Well, it's not.


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


 
Patrick Fagan of the Heritage Foundation reveals that going to church is  
the secret to better health and a happier life. In a new report called Why  
Religion Matters, Fagan argues that religious practice "strengthens  
individuals, families, communities, and society as a whole. It significantly  
affects educational and job attainment and reduces the incidence of such  
major social problems as out-of-wedlock births, drug and alcohol  
addiction, crime, and delinquency." 
 



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 
Research indicates that church attendance and good cheer go together.  
"Happiness is greater and psychological stress is lower for those who  
attend religious services regularly," notes Fagan. Less stress means better  
health, of course, but the benefits don't stop there. Church attendance also  
leads to happier, longer-lasting marriages. "Regular church attendance is  
the critical factor in marital stability," says Fagan. Even among those who  
have separated from their partners, "reconciliation rates are higher among  
regular church attendees." 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


But wait, there's more. "One of the most powerful of all factors in  
preventing out-of-wedlock births is the regular practice of religious belief,  
[which] sharply reduces the incidence of premarital intercourse. The  
reverse is also true," says Fagan. "The absence of religious practice  
accompanies sexual permissiveness and premarital sex." 
 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



Still not convinced? What if we told you that "alcohol abuse is 300 percent  
higher among those who do not attend church"? It's true. Not only that, but  
"alcoholics with a religious background or strong religious beliefs are  
much more likely to seek help and treatment." What about suicide? "The  
practice of religion reduces the rate of suicide," says Fagan, more  
effectively than anything else. "Those who attend church frequently are  
four times less likely to commit suicide than those who never attend."  
Church attendance also reduces the incidence of depression, before it can  
lead to suicide. Adolescents are particularly at risk for depression, but they  
"tend to experience fewer anxieties of growing up if they are religious." 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;




Patrick Fagan concludes that "regular religious practice is both an  
individual and social good. It is a powerful answer to many of our most  
significant social problems." Going to church is "good for individuals,  
families, states, and the nation. It improves health, learning, economic  
well-being, self-control, self-esteem, and empathy. It reduces the incidence  
of social pathologies, such as out-of-wedlock births, crime, delinquency,  
drug and alcohol addiction, health problems, anxieties, and prejudices."  
So, don't delay. Take advantage of this amazing opportunity now. For a  
happier, healthier life, go to church regularly.

<h2>The Future of Education

</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>    
The political correctness movement has captured America's universities, and the NEA dominates our    
public school system. But students won't have to learn in lock step much longer, because the technological    
revolution will soon make these institutions of indoctrination obsolete.</i></blockquote>
<p>    
    
Years ago, many Americans got their education from correspondence courses. Now, an enterprising outfit    
in Springfield, Virginia has updated the concept for the '90s. The Teaching Company offers more than 60    
college-level courses on audio and video cassettes. One of their more popular offerings is a 70-part series    
of 45-minute lectures entitled The Great Minds of the Western Intellectual Tradition. Two well-known    
and respected scholars from prestigious Ivy League universities deliver most of the lectures, with four    
other "superstar teachers" supplying the balance. "The result," according to a full-page advertisement in a    
popular weekly magazine, "is a definitive survey of Western thought by an all-star teaching team with no    
equal in lecturing skill at any single college campus anywhere in the world."    



  



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


  
What could be better than access to "an all-star teaching team" on videocassettes at a fraction of the cost    
of college tuition? How about a give-and-take between you and a noted scholar in the privacy of your own    
home? That's available now, too -- thanks to Bob Jones University and something called the Live    
Interactive Network Classroom, or LINC for short. The Live Interactive Network Classroom can be in    
your living room or in a traditional schoolroom -- or in any other private or public facility. No matter    
where you are, you'll receive daily satellite transmissions from a teacher in a television studio -- a teacher    
you can see and hear and speak to, as can any other student anywhere in the country who happens to be    
participating in the same class.



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


     
    
Who's the intended target of this satellite schooling service? Surely not the nation's elite. "The wealthy    
will always be able to afford the best private education," writes syndicated columnist Cal Thomas. In a    
recent column describing the Live Interactive Network Classroom, Thomas argues that LINC "can free the    
middle class, and especially the poor, from their bondage to government schools. As an all-in-one    
resource, it can maintain the highest standards in foreign languages, math, and science, as well as    
advanced subjects, such as physics, that are not always available in private education." Cal Thomas    
predicts that LINC "could eventually allow all parents the freedom to choose what they believe is best for    
their children, at a reasonable price, and without the indoctrination that passes for education in the current    
intellectually and spiritually closed system" that all taxpayers must subsidize whether they want to or not. 



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

   
    
If the Teaching Company and the Live Interactive Network Classroom developed by Bob Jones University    
are any indication of what education will be like in the future, American students have every reason to    
rejoice. American educators, on the other hand, had better start looking for new jobs.

<h2>
Free Trade Follies
</h2>

<blockquote><i>
Did you think that the breakup of the Soviet Union and the liberation of the  
Captive Nations of Europe had tolled the death knell  for socialism? Well,  
one trade expert predicts that international treaties such as NAFTA and  
GATT will ultimately destroy the middle classes throughout the world and  
lead to a resurgence of the welfare state. 
 </blockquote></i>

<P>  

The World Trade Organization, created by the General Agreement on  
Tariffs and Trade, is now in operation. Its first major act was to order the  
United States to change its rules on the quality of imported gasoline or face  
sanctions by the international community. The governments of Venezuela  
and Brazil had appealed to the World Trade Organization to compel the  
U.S. to accept their gasoline, which does not meet U.S. environmental  
standards. Congress will now have to revise our Clean Air Act regulations  
regarding gasoline emissions or U.S. industries will face "cross-retaliation"  
trade sanctions. 
 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


This ruling is an omen of things to come, predicts William Gill of the  
American Coalition for Competitive Trade. Gill and his group were the  
first to warn that the North American Free Trade Agreement (known as  
NAFTA) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (known as  
GATT) "were the first big steps toward a world government that would rob  
America of our cherished independence as a nation." NAFTA and GATT  
threaten our prosperity as well as our sovereignty. Gill says nine million  
jobs "have been lost in the corporate downsizing" of the 1990s, one million  
of which are "directly attributable to NAFTA." 
 



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The damage doesn't end there. NAFTA "and other free trade efforts to  
erase all national borders" have unleashed an invasion of illegal drugs and  
illegal aliens into the United States. Infectious diseases are also entering  
our country at increasing rates. "The death rate from this invidious source  
rose . . .58 percent between 1980 and 1992," observes Gill, who describes  
this 12-year period as an "era when trade tore down virtually all the  
traditional defenses of our borders." 
 




<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Ironically, NAFTA has not done our neighbors south of the border any  
good either. Gill reports that "the middle class in Mexico is being wiped  
out, joining the hundreds of thousands of Mexican farmers driven off their  
land by NAFTA in the tragic trek downhill into abysmal poverty and  
despair." He warns that "free trade is sowing the seeds of revolution"  
throughout the world. "There have already been uprisings in Mexico and  
violent strikes in France," Gill observes, and this is only the beginning. He  
predicts that the unrest will rise, resulting in "a worldwide resurgence of  
socialism as the chaos caused by open borders forces governments into  
restoring and expanding welfare programs for the poor." The American  
Coalition for Competitive Trade intends to keep publicizing the defects of  
NAFTA and GATT and other free trade follies until public opinion finally  
forces our government to repudiate what William Gill calls an "insane  
policy that is strangling America."

<h2>
Whole Language Supporter Recants
</h2>
<Blockquote><i>

If a child hasn't learned to read by the end of the first grade, he's been  
cheated, and the odds are that he'11 never achieve his true potential.</blockquote></i>

<P>   
Bill Honig was State Superintendent of Public Instruction for California  
from 1983 to 1993. During that decade, he presided over a school system  
that threw out many of the proven pedagogical approaches of the past. The  
test scores for California's public school students plummeted as a direct  
result of this ill-advised change in direction. That's the bad news. The good  
news is that Bill Honig learned from this needless disaster, and maybe his  
testimony will help keep other superintendents of education from making  
the same mistake. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Bill Honig has written a book called Teaching Our Children to Read. In it,  
he emphasizes that educators must ensure that all schoolchildren are  
"reading beginning books by mid-first grade" and be prepared to resort to  
"organized intervention" for those who aren't. Children who are not  
beginning to read by this point, says Honig, "almost never recover." To  
read successfully, children must learn how to break words into their  
smallest "sound chunks. " In other words, they must master phonics. Honig  
argues that "the amount of time a student is engaged in phonics instruction  
is highly predictive of subsequent reading achievement." 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The former state superintendent of education does not acknowledge his  
own mistake in allowing the destructive Whole Language method to  
become entrenched in state schools during his tenure. Nevertheless, he  
asserts emphatically that children will learn to read only if they are taught  
to sound out the syllables of the English language and put them together  
like building blocks -- not by using pictures to guess at words, as  
recommended by Whole Language advocates. Honig explains that "bad  
habits of guessing" make learning to read much more difficult, and argues  
that "beginning readers who rely too heavily on contextual clues, such as  
pictures or the connection of other words in the passage, are distracted  
from looking at the letters in a word and connecting those letter patterns to  
words in their minds."<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Honig's rejection of the Whole Language approach should have  
tremendous impact on his colleagues throughout the country because of the  
prestigious position Honig once held in California. Unfortunately, the  
ineffective Whole Language approach to reading has driven phonics out of  
most of our nation's school systems. Honig reports that "very few  
instructional programs currently in use provide children with materials  
designed specifically to connect with systematic and sequenced skills  
development. In some cases," he says, "state, county, district, or university  
leaders are overtly or subtly antagonistic to the skills components and  
discourage phonics teaching." Maybe Bill Honig's new book will persuade  
some of these ideologues to take an honest look at the damage they're  
doing with the Whole Language approach. Maybe some of them will  
resolve to teach America's schoolchildren how to read the right way --  
using the proven method of systematic phonics.

Self-Reliance
</h2><blockquote><i>

If displaced workers spent as much time looking for new jobs as they do complaining about having lost  
their old ones, they'd find themselves employed again much faster. 

</blockquote></i>
<P> 
Bill Prince was merchandising director for Frito-Lay in Dallas from 1959 to 1966, a period during which  
sales skyrocketed from $50 million a year to $325 million. When Frito-Lay merged with Pepsi Cola,  
however, Bill resigned to start his own food company. Despite an enormous personal investment of time,  
money, and his own considerable experience, the company failed, and Bill was obliged to start all over  
again. 
 

 



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
It wasn't the first time he'd been in that predicament, nor would it be the last. Much like Sisyphus, the  
character in Greek mythology whose fate it was forever to roll a giant rock up a steep hill only to have it  
roll down again every time he reached the top, Bill knew from personal experience that life is a series of  
challenges. Whether you succeed or fail in any given challenge, there's always another giant rock waiting  
to be rolled up another steep hill. 
 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Bill Prince worked ceaselessly throughout his life, in a wide variety of occupations. Over the course of a  
50-year career, he was never unemployed for more than a month at a time. "Some of the time, my income  
was in the top five percent, but not always," Bill recalls, "because I took any job I could get when I needed  
work." 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Bill notes that in recent years many companies have had to downsize in order to survive. This trend has  
been accompanied by increasing numbers of people "complaining about those mean, nasty, uncaring  
corporations and businesses who fire good and loyal workers." Bill wonders if these carpers and grousers  
"really believe" that a company has a lifetime obligation to anyone it hires, "no matter what kind of  
problems the company may have in the future?" He marvels at the attitude so prevalent among displaced  
workers that the government should "do something to save them." They obviously don't understand that  
government intervention is the main reason their jobs have evaporated. Why can't they see, as Bill so  
clearly does, that, "if government had not been passing all those business-busting laws and writing  
harassing, anti-business regulations, they might still have their jobs?" 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"Whatever happened to individual initiative and enterprise?" Bill asks. "And why do people turn to  
government like they are asking for manna from heaven?" Bill insists that middle-aged managers thrown  
back into the job market have no one but themselves to blame if they prefer to remain idle rather than  
accept a job they consider beneath them. "Maybe the reason many downsized people are downsized is  
because they simply no longer have the drive, ambition, and creative ability to withstand competition from  
younger, hungrier people," he speculates in the February issue of a monthly newsletter called Bill's  
Soapbox -- written, edited, and published by Bill Prince himself, at the ripe young age of 74!

<h2>
Myths About Crime
</h2>
<blockquote><i>
  
False ideas can have tragic consequences, say two respected criminologists, who argue that false ideas   
about crime have made the crime problem worse.  
</BLOCKQUOTE></I>
<P>  
 
"For the last quarter-century, a network of anti-incarceration, pro-prisoner analysts, activists, lawyers,   
lobbyists, journalists, and judges has perpetuated a number of false ideas about crime and punishment in   
the United States," say criminologists Charles Logan and John DiIulio. In an essay titled "Ten Deadly   
Myths About Crime and Punishment in the U.S.," published in a new book called Criminal Justice: The   
Legal System vs. Individual Responsibility, Logan and DiIulio argue that "the consequences of these false   
ideas have been quite tragic indeed." They've made it easier for criminals to indulge in crime, and they've   
concentrated crime "in economically distressed inner-city neighborhoods, inviting the criminal predators   
of these areas to repeatedly victimize their struggling underclass neighbors."  
  


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One of the most enduring myths about crime in the United States is that it is caused by poverty. Logan and   
DiIulio report that many academic criminologists believe the myth that "capitalism produces pockets of   
poverty, inequality, and unemployment, which then foster crime. The solution [according to this view] is   
government intervention to provide jobs, stimulate the economy, and reduce poverty and other social ills."   
The truth, as it turns out, is quite the opposite. Poverty does not cause crime; crime, on the other hand,   
does cause poverty.  
  


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



Logan and DiIulio note that "inner city areas where crime is rampant have tremendous potential for   
economic growth, given their infrastructure of railways, highways, electric power, water systems, and   
large supply of available labor. There is every reason for these areas to be wealthy," they say, "and, indeed,   
many of them have been rich in the past. But crime takes a terrible toll on physical, fiscal, and human   
capital, making it difficult to accumulate wealth and break out of the cycle of poverty. Criminals steal and   
destroy property, drive away customers and investors, reduce property values, and depreciate the quality of   
life in a neighborhood. Businesses close and working families move away, leaving behind a vacuum of   
opportunity." Inner cities need "physical protection and security" to make them viable again; instead, they   
get "economic intervention."  
  


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



Another myth about crime in the United States is that prisons are filled with "petty offenders who should   
not be there." Logan and DiIulio say it isn't so. They cite data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics   
showing that "U.S. prison populations consist overwhelmingly of violent and repeat offenders."  
  

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A third myth concerns the physical conditions within our nation's prisons. "There are two popular and   
competing images of American prisons," report Logan and Dilulio. "In one image, all or most prisons are   
hell holes. In the other image, all or most prisons are country clubs. Each image fits some prisons," they   
concede. "But the vast majority of prisons in the U.S. today are neither hell holes nor country clubs." They   
are what they're supposed to be: an effective means for isolating and punishing the criminal element.

<h2>
The Point of Punishment
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
Most Americans believe that our criminal justice system works pretty well,  
and that punishments meted out to criminals generally fit the crime. Some  
liberal critics, however, hold a very different view of crime and  
punishment. 
</blockquote></i>
<P>


Some sophisticated liberals believe that "America is an oppressive, racist  
society, and prisons are a none-too-subtle way of subjugating the nation's  
poor and minority populations," say criminologists Charles Logan and  
John Dilulio. In an essay titled "Ten Deadly Myths About Crime and  
Punishment in the U.S.," published in a new book called Criminal Justice:  
The Legal System vs. Individual Responsibility, Logan and Dilulio insist  
that "there is simply no empirical evidence to support the view that  
African-Americans, or the members of other racial and ethnic minorities in  
the U.S., are far more likely than whites" to suffer the legal consequences  
of criminal actions. Differences in conviction rates and sentencing, they  
say, are determined by "such mundane factors as the amount of evidence  
against a defendant, and whether or not a credible eyewitness testified." 
 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Logan and Ditulio also rebut the common misconception that our prisons  
are "prohibitively expensive." They contend that "it is morally myopic, and  
conceptually and empirically moronic, to argue that public money spent on  
prisons and prisoners is public money wasted." They concede that, "if the  
typical offender committed only one petty property crime per year, then  
paying thousands and thousands of dollars to keep him confined would be  
a bad social investment. But, if he committed a dozen serious property or  
violent crimes each year, then the social benefits of keeping him  
imprisoned might well exceed the social costs of not doing so." Logan and  
DiIulio cite one study that calculated a "social cost" of $430,000 per year  
for a felon left at large -- roughly twenty times what it costs to keep him  
incarcerated. That figure may be overstated, but the fact remains that it is  
far less expensive for society to imprison a felon than to let him roam free. 



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
  
The biggest myth or misconception of all, say Logan and DiIulio, is that  
"punishment itself is inherently wrong. It is largely because they are  
opposed to punishment generally and to imprisonment in particular that  
many people argue so strongly that we must address the root causes of  
crime, that our criminal justice system discriminates, that we are overly  
punitive and haven't considered alternatives, that prisons are too costly and  
overcrowded, and that we must look to the courts for reform." Logan and  
DiIulio see punishment as a positive good, however, one that "affirms  
important moral and cultural values. Legal punishment," they insist, "is a  
legitimate and . . . even a noble aspect of our culture." 
 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
  

Logan and DiIulio reject "the false dichotomy between punishment and  
'humanitarianism."' They argue that punishment, properly and fairly  
applied, is essential to the treatment of people "as human beings, rather  
than as objects. Punishment," they say, "is an affirmation of the autonomy,  
responsibility, and dignity of the individual."

<h2>New-Contract With America</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
"How has a nation conceived in liberty and opposition to tyranny arrived    
at a point today where citizens are more fearful of their own government    
threatening their rights than they are of any other government?" A    
firebrand freshman Congressman answers his own question.  
</i></blockquote>
<P>     
"Americans deeply believe in the principles of America, but they don't    
see [those principles] reflected in their government," observes freshman    
Republican Representative Sam Brownback of Kansas in the March issue    
of Policy Review. ''Americans believe in freedom, democracy, moral    
values, family, community, and free markets," says Brownback. "Yet    
their government seizes their rights without their consent. Government    
has become their master, not their servant. " Brownback is a staunch    
proponent of the three R's: Reducing, Reforming, and Returning. He says    
we should reduce the size of the federal government, reform Congress,    
and return to "the basic values that built the country: work and family    
and the recognition of a higher moral authority."   
  <p>
In a frenzy of false compassion, our once-limited government "now tries    
to do all things for all people," Brownback observes, arguing that it fails miserably in this task. "We have discovered, by spending trillions of
dollars and taking rights and freedoms away from individuals, that    
government cannot solve all of our problems." The American people    
believe, and rightly so, that "they can handle most of their problems    
better than the federal government can."   
<p>   
If we return to our original principles of limited government, "then our    
nation, our economy, our liberties, and our social fiber will grow    
stronger than we have seen for a generation," predicts Brownback. The    
Congressman from Kansas contends that Americans must "look first to    
themselves and to each other for help," rather than rely on their elected 
representatives. He calls for the restoration of "the master-servant    
relationship between the people and the government," acknowledging    
that many of his colleagues need to be reminded that they hold the    
subordinate position. They also need to be reminded that the powers of    
the federal government are strictly limited by our Constitution.    
Observing that there is "no constitutional basis" for most of the federal 
government's current activities, Brownback argues that it is time to "re-   
limit our federal government so it can perform its proper functions well, 
and leave to the people and the states those functions which the federal    
government was never intended to perform."   
<p>   
Brownback calls for "a new Contract with America -- one that passes    
laws, not merely proposes them." Brownback's Contract would reduce    
federal spending "from 22 percent of our Gross Domestic Product to 15    
percent or less," restrict the tax code to the raising of revenue and    
"remove all social engineering" from it, cut the number of cabinet    
agencies from 14 to no more than nine "and restrict their regulatory    
powers under constitutional principles," require the citation of "precise  constitutional authority" for all proposed legislation, and eliminate all
government interference in private charity. Sounds like a pretty good    
contract. Where do we sign?

<title>Duplantier:  Libertine Libraries  -- 3/19/96</title>

<h2>Libertine Libraries</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
Your children cannot legally buy obscene rap music albums at a record    
store. They may, however, be able to check out the same revolting trash    
at your local library. 
</i></blockquote>
<P>     
  
Imagine your 12-year-old child coming home from the public library    
with a CD or cassette tape of 2 Live Crew's vulgar rap album As Nasty    
As They Wanna Be. Do you think it's impossible? Do you think no    
publicly-funded library would purchase music glorifying the rape and    
mutilation of women? Do you think no responsible librarian would    
release such material to children? Think again.   
<p>   
Public libraries all over America have multiple copies of As Nasty As    
They Wanna Be and other violent and salacious recordings. They    
routinely loan these materials to children without the knowledge or    
permission of their parents. It's their policy to do that.   
<p>   
In the February issue of the Education Reporter, longtime teacher Helen    
Chaffee Biehle describes how she recently discovered that the public    
libraries she's loved all her life are no longer child-friendly forums for    
fact-finding and fantasizing. Having read in her local newspaper that a    
12-year-old boy had indeed been allowed to check out 2 Live Crew's    
filthy tape from one of the county libraries, Mrs. Biehle decided to call    
the library director herself and find out how this terrible mistake had    
occurred. She discovered that it was no mistake.   
<p>   
The library director was "completely calm and utterly unapologetic,"    
Mrs. Biehle recalls. Following the guidelines of the American Library    
Association's Intellectual Freedom Manual as regards the handling of    
complaints, the director offered three lines of defense. The first was an    
appeal to diversity. "Neither you nor I might approve of As Nasty As    
They Wanna Be," she conceded, "but we serve a diverse population."    
Then there was the philosophical dodge. "Not to buy the tape would be    
making a moral judgment," she said. "We can't do that." The ultimate    
defense, however, was an American Library Association document called    
the Library Bill of Rights, which has absolutely no legal standing but    
purports to prohibit "censorship" on the basis of age.   
 <p>  
The great irony, of course, is that the guardians of intellectual freedom at    
the American Library Association are anything but tolerant when it    
comes to considering the opinions of others. It's not diversity that they    
believe in, but perversity. They make moral judgments -- or should we    
say, immoral judgments -- all the time. Censorship is the very essence of    
their profession. They decide which books, records, and videotapes will    
be made available to library patrons, and they routinely screen out    
materials that contradict their biases. Woe betide the independent-minded    
librarian who dares to defy them by respecting the values and opinions of    
the taxpayers who make their jobs possible. "The acceptance of moral    
responsibility for children in the library is now called 'unprofessional,"'    
notes Helen Chaffee Biehle; "making a responsible moral judgment about    
materials purchased for the library is called 'elitist,' and the librarian who    
is brave enough to do either is labeled a 'censor.'"

<h2>Terrorism Bill</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
If the House of Representatives passes the so-called "anti-terrorism" bill    
now under consideration, American citizens will experience "a profound    
loss of liberty, for no real gain in their security. "  
</i></blockquote>
<P>     
   
 
<p>   
"It is astounding to see the 1 04th Congress move to expand the power    
and intrusiveness of the federal government,'' says David Kopel of the    
Cato Institute. "These are the same Republicans sent to Congress to    
reduce the federal government's erosion of individual rights."    
Nevertheless, many of these avowed opponents of Big Government are    
supporting a bill that Kopel says would "turn Uncle Sam into Big    
Brother."   
 <p>  
The House version of the proposed legislation would authorize federal    
agents to pry into the personal affairs of any American citizen, says    
Kopel, "without first obtaining a court order, and without even a    
suspicion that the individual is involved in criminal activity." Such    
invasions of privacy would be just the beginning, for the bill also "gives    
the president the power to label a group a 'terrorist organization' and    
make it a federal felony to support the legal activities of that group." The    
Justice Department's unsuccessful effort to prove the existence of a    
criminal conspiracy among pro-life organizations is a clear indication of    
what sort of groups are likely to be targeted as "terrorists."   
<p>   
It gets worse. Kopel notes that "illegal wiretaps would be admissible in    
court, as long as the wiretapping federal official was acting in 'good    
faith.'" How can the victim of an inquisition prove that his persecutor    
acted in bad faith? He can't. That's the point. The bill also contains "gun    
control legislation that could never pass this Congress on its own merits,"    
says Kopel. "Currently it is illegal to sell someone a firearm if you know    
it will be used in a crime. This bill would apply a five-year sentence to    
cases in which the seller allegedly 'should' have known that the gun    
would be used in a crime." Standard background checks will no longer    
suffice, it seems. Will gun dealers now have to obtain psychological    
profiles of all potential customers? Will they be expected to detect that    
cliche of murder mysteries, the homicidal gleam in the eye?   
<p>   
Do you think that American legislators could never endorse warrantless    
searches, illegal wiretaps, presumption of guilt, detention without trial,    
unseen witnesses, or secret testimony? Alas, they already have, in the    
anti-terrorism bill pending in Congress. The Senate bill is worse; it    
demonstrates even less regard for our constitutionally-protected liberties.    
The Senate version of the bill, says David Kopel, "contains a number of    
seriously disturbing and dangerous provisions," including military    
involvement in local law enforcement, digital wiretapping capabilities,    
the reclassification of apolitical crimes as terrorism, and increased    
funding for the storm troopers at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and    
Firearms. Is the threat of terrorism really so great that we should give up    
many of our hard-won liberties to protect against it? Most Americans    
would not be happy with the result.

<h2>Kit Carson Scouts</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
"To be an enemy of the United States can be dangerous, " Senator 
Daniel  Patrick Moynihan once quipped. "To be an ally can be fatal. "
</i></blockquote>
<P>     
 
They were called the Kit Carson Scouts, these daring young Vietnamese  
men recruited into the U.S. Army and Marine Corps to guide our combat  
units into enemy territory. They served us faithfully, and we abandoned  
them. 
<p>
Many of the Kit Carson Scouts were former members of the Viet Cong  
who had seen the evils of communism and turned against it, says James  
Tyson, president of the Council for the Defense of Freedom. Others were  
recruited from border villages because of their familiarity with the terrain  
occupied by the communists. Nearly 7,000 Kit Carson Scouts were  
recruited during the Vietnam War, and 4,000 of these courageous soldiers  
were still actively serving when American forces pulled out in 1975.  
"Since then," says Tyson, "the U.S. has done nothing to help these men  
get out of Vietnam safely." 
<p>
What's become of our faithful allies? No one knows for sure. What's  
worse, no one seems to care. "After the fall of Saigon, the Vietnamese  
communists started a campaign to round up all members of the South  
Vietnamese government and armed forces, or those who had worked for  
the Americans," reports Tyson. "Most were killed or thrown into deadly  
're-education camps.' The Kit Carson Scouts were a primary target. The  
communists put a bounty on them, so that many neighbors in their  
villages turned them in. Two thousand are believed to have been  
executed." 
<p>
Half of the Kit Carson Scouts, our former allies, may have been  
slaughtered because we made no provision for their deliverance. What  
about the other half? "Another 2000 are estimated to have survived  
undetected," says Tyson. "These men have faced deadly danger ever  
since and need our help. Many may still be in Vietnam, but some may be  
among the flood of refugees who have succeeded in getting out of the 
country, by risking their lives at sea or through other means." Getting out  
is one thing; staying out is another. Tyson concedes that "thousands of  
Vietnamese have been settled in the U.S. and other countries since the  
war. But 70,000 still languish in refugee camps in the neighboring  
countries of Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Hong Kong." 
<p>
Repatriation means certain death for the Kit Carson Scouts. Nevertheless,  
those who have made it to the refugee camps must prove that they are  
"political" refugees, with the right to be resettled in other countries. Mere  
"economic" refugees, whose concerns about their personal safety in their  
native land are considered unwarranted, do not qualify for asylum. "The 
Kit Carson Scouts have an air-tight case as 'political' refugees, since they  
were employed by the U.S. military," says Tyson. "But our government 
has failed to do anything, either to help them escape from Vietnam or to  
assist those who have gotten out in being properly classified."

<h2>Medical Savings Accounts</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
Health care spending today is more than twenty times what it was in    
1965. The primary reason for that dramatic increase is the third-party    
payment system. 
</i></blockquote>
<p>   
Research analyst Peter Barwick of the Commonwealth Foundation in    
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania argues that "people are never as careful in    
spending someone else's money as they are in spending their own." This    
simple fact of human nature is what's behind the spiraling cost of health    
care in America. "Between 1965 and 1995, total annual spending on    
health care in the U.S. rose from $41.6 billion to $938.3 billion in    
constant dollars," reports Barwick. "This dramatic increase in health care    
spending coincided with a sharp rise in third-party payment." The    
Pennsylvania researcher estimates that "79 cents of every dollar used to    
purchase health care is paid by someone other than the person receiving    
treatment."   
<p>   
Barwick sees a direct link "between rising health care costs and the    
increase in third-party payment." He argues that there is little incentive    
for economizing "when people only have to pay 21 cents to get a dollar's    
worth of coverage." When patients don't care how much a particular    
medicine or treatment will cost, "physicians and other medical    
professionals will have little reason to seek the most cost-effective ways    
to provide quality care."   
<p>   
The solution, Barwick believes, is Medical Savings Accounts (known as    
an MSAs), which provide "the individual consumer with the resources    
needed to pay directly for ordinary health care expenditures, together    
with the incentive to do so responsibly." Barwick describes MSAs as    
"tax-free accounts into which individuals may deposit money to be used    
to pay for everyday health care needs. Typically," he says, "MSAs are    
combined with a catastrophic insurance policy which covers all health    
care expenses beyond a high fixed deductible."   
<p>   
Barwick argues that "MSAs provide health care consumers with a strong    
incentive to conserve resources, since the consumer gets to keep whatever    
cost-savings he is able to achieve. By encouraging frugality among    
consumers, MSAs would also provide incentive to physicians and other    
health care professionals to utilize the most costeffective means of    
providing quality care." Barwick notes that other proposed health care    
reforms "seek to regulate patients, physicians, and hospitals more heavily,    
resulting in restrictions on the freedom of the patient to choose a    
physician and [the freedom] of the physician to select the type of    
treatment to be used. In contrast, MSAs leave these choices where they    
belong: in the hands of individual health care recipients and their    
physicians."   
<p>   
In addition to providing patients and doctors with an incentive to save,    
MSAs would reduce administrative costs, which account for as much as    
25 percent of health care spending. They would also reduce out-of-pocket    
expenses for "the vast majority of health care recipients." And they would    
solve the portability problem by allowing employees to "take any unspent    
MSA funds with them when leaving a job."

<h2>Union Electioneering</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
The AFL-CIO recently announced that it plans to spend $35 million to   
influence the outcome of this year's elections. That's seven times what the   
labor federation normally spends on national elections!
</i></blockquote>
<P>     
  
  
 
  

<p>  
"After decades of declining political influence, labor unions have pledged   
to multiply their election efforts this year with a $35 million war chest,"   
says Charles Griffin of the Heritage Foundation. "The first real test of   
organized labor's new activism -- Oregon's special election for a United   
States Senate seat -- resulted in a narrow victory for the candidate heavily   
backed by big labor. Similar efforts can be expected in numerous House   
and Senate races this fall." After all, new AFL-CIO President John   
Sweeney won election to his post late last year by "pledging more active   
organization drives to help increase the union rolls in America and   
promising vocal political campaigns to promote the union movement's   
liberal agenda."  
<p>  
The AFL-CIO made more than 230,000 phone calls and sent out more   
than 350,000 pieces of mail on behalf of the Democratic candidate in the   
special election in Oregon to fill the Senate seat vacated by Bob   
Packwood. "The AFL-CIO did not act alone, however. By joining forces   
with at least 11 individual unions, it was able to mount a considerable   
presence in this one targeted race," observes Griffin. "The considerable   
firepower mustered by these organizations resulted in more than $   
183,000 in political action committee donations to the Democratic   
candidate."  
<p>  
Griffin emphasizes that "impact is not measured in direct PAC spending   
alone. Phone banks, direct mail, paid advertising, and grassroots   
organizing are all significant activities that labor used in Oregon and can   
be expected to use throughout this year to promote favored political   
candidates. Many of these activities can be funded out of forced dues. In   
Oregon, these efforts were worth hundreds of thousands of dollars more   
than direct, reported expenditures."  
<p>  
Griffin predicts that "the AFL-CIO and other labor organizations will   
continue to invest heavily in campaign activity" during the course of this   
election year, and concedes that they have every right to do so.   
"Unfortunately," he says, "much of this politicking will be funded   
through mandatory worker dues, and much is unreported and unregulated   
by federal election laws." Griffin argues that it is unjust for union   
members to be "compelled to surrender their own pay . . . to finance   
political activity to which they may well object." He urges Members of   
Congress, in addressing campaign finance reform, to consider "whether it   
is fair to force every union member to pay for the ideological warfare of   
union officials.'' Reform legislation, says Griffin, should stipulate that   
"only voluntary contributions are used for politics."  
<p>  
Organized labor promises to be a major player in the 1996 elections.   
While conceding that unions should be "as free as other organizations to   
pursue their political goals," Charles Griffin of the Heritage Foundation   
insists that "the coercive nature of union funding, and the regulatory   
advantages unions enjoy, are unjust and unfair."

<h2>World Trade Organization</h2>

<P>     
    

    
The World Trade Organization's recent ruling against the United States     
is a taste of things to come -- unless American voters can persuade their     
Congressmen to abrogate the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade     
and say no to the New World Order.    
<p>    
The jig is up. The internationalists have jumped the gun. They've shown     
their hand too soon. And now their legislative lackeys in the U.S.     
Congress are obliged, in the middle of an election year, to defend the     
indefensible. Having sworn to uphold the Constitution and protect the     
sovereignty of the United States, they must now figure out a way to     
justify their support for a treaty that undermines both -- or resign     
themselves to humiliating defeats in November.    
<p>    
Congress ratified the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (known as     
GATT) during its lame-duck session in December 1994. That treaty     
established the World Trade Organization ( known as WTO) and gave it     
the power to settle trade disputes among signatory nations. Well, lo and     
behold, the WTO, in its first major decision, has ruled against the United     
States! The Members of Congress who ratified the treaty knew that such     
an outcome was a distinct possibility. It was widely predicted at the time.     
Nevertheless, they willingly voted to subject the economic, social, and     
legislative decisions of American citizens to the whims of an international     
tribunal.    
<p>    
What that international tribunal did was to order the United States to     
change its rules on the quality of imported gasoline or face sanctions     
against U.S. industries. The governments of Venezuela and Brazil had     
appealed to the World Trade Organization to compel the U.S. to accept     
their gasoline, which does not meet U.S. environmental standards.     
Congress will now have to revise our Clean Air Act regulations regarding     
gasoline emissions or U.S. industries will face "cross-retaliation" trade     
sanctions. Since the United States does not export gasoline to Venezuela     
or Brazil, there is no direct way to exact revenge on U.S. petroleum     
interests. So, in the name of "free trade," the WTO will probably order     
trade sanctions against other U.S. industries that are wholly unrelated to     
the gasoline industry or the EPA regulations.    
<p> 
Now, Democrats and Republicans both have egg on their faces. President     
Clinton promised his liberal supporters in 1994 that the WTO would     
never undercut our environmental regulations. The Republican leadership     
in Congress promised their conservative backers that American     
sovereignty would not be endangered by the agreement. Well, it turns out     
they were both mistaken, or less than candid.    
<p>    
William Gill of the American Coalition for Competitive Trade considers     
the recent WTO ruling truly ominous. Gill and his group tried to warn     
Members of Congress that the North American Free Trade Agreement     
and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade "were the first big steps     
toward a world government that would rob America of our cherished     
independence as a nation." But our elected representatives just wouldn't     
listen. By the time November 5th rolls around, they may wish they had.

<title>Duplantier:  UN Tax  -- 3/27/96</title>

<h2>UN Tax</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
The proposal for a global tax to finance the operations of the United   
Nations went over like a lead balloon among average Americans. Many   
of our so-called leaders support the idea, however, seeing it as a   
necessary step on the road to a New World Order.  
</i></blockquote>
<P>         
United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali thinks the UN   
could be a lot more effective if the world body did not have to answer to   
any of its member nations. If it had its own means of support, and its own   
army, then Boutros-Ghali and his fellow internationalists could give   
orders instead of taking them. The idea makes perfect sense to power-  
hungry globalists, who simply can't understand why it doesn't appeal to   
the citizens of nations expected to sacrifice their sovereignty.  
<p>  
Boutros-Ghali wants to finance the nearly bankrupt United Nations by   
imposing a global tax on foreign exchange transactions. A mere half-of-  
one-percent tax on these transactions would generate an astounding $1.5   
trillion. The Secretary General is willing to consider alternative means of   
raising revenue, of course, such as taxes on international travel, fossil   
fuels, international arms sales, and so on. The important thing is to   
establish an independent revenue source. "It is time to seriously address   
the need for a United Nations that can operate on a secure and steady   
financial foundation," said Boutros-Ghali when he floated his unpopular   
proposal. "I'm sure we will win in the end, and that we will obtain from   
the international community [an understanding] that we need to have our   
own income."  
<p>  
The international community may understand Boutros-Ghali's objectives,   
but so does the average American citizen, and he wants no part of it. "The   
ability to control territory and command an army, like the ability to tax,   
represents the exercise of sovereign power," observes Thomas Sheehy of   
the Heritage Foundation. "The UN should never have this power; it   
would be a usurpation of the constitutional rights of the American people.   
These rights are protected by the U.S. government, not the UN. The UN   
does not represent the interests of Americans; it represents the interests of   
its 185 member states, many of which are undemocratic and repressive."  
<p>  
Sheehy denies that the UN suffers from "a lack of funding. In fact," he   
says, "UN spending has been mushrooming, and that is the real problem."   
Still, the UN wants more. "In September 1996, the UN Working Group   
on Finances will submit a report on financing to the UN General   
Assembly," observes Sheehy. "This report may very well recommend a   
UN tax scheme." Sheehy notes that legislation has been introduced in   
both houses of the U.S. Congress to prohibit U.S. compliance with UN   
efforts to implement a tax. He argues that "the last thing the UN needs is   
more money and less accountability." The real question, however, is what   
America needs: We need leaders who will respect and protect our nation's   
sovereignty. The best way to do that is by withdrawing from the United   
Nations and expelling this would-be world government from our shores.

<h2>Michael New </h2>
 
<P>
<blockquote><i>
The United Nations wants to be a truly autonomous world government,  
but first it needs to have its own authority, and its own military  
force. U.S. Army Specialist Michael New's refusal to don the UN  
uniform was a challenge that could not be ignored.
</i></blockquote>
<p> 
The court martial and conviction of U.S. Army Specialist Michael New  
for refusing to wear the UN uniform on a so-called "peacekeeping"  
mission to Macedonia was a necessary step on the road to the New World  
Order. Had New not been punished, the other 550 servicemen in his unit  
might have had second thoughts about donning UN helmets, trading their  
U.S. identification cards for UN I.D. cards, and marching off to  
Macedonia to serve as pawns in a conflict of no consequence to America.  
How would the UN ever put together an army of its own if every soldier  
in the world insisted on maintaining allegiance to his homeland? 
<p> 
To justify the order regarding the wearing of UN uniforms, Specialist  
New's commanding officer made vague references to the following  
phrases: "UN guidelines," "National Command Authority," "UN  
Charter," "Domestic Law," "Commander in Chief," and "UN Security  
Council Resolutions." But Specialist New was not convinced. He argued  
that the order to alter his uniform violated U.S. Army regulations against  
wearing any unauthorized insignia, decoration, medal, or uniform. "I am  
not a UN soldier," New protested. "I am an American soldier." 
<p> 
The Army was in "a difficult position," remarks Dennis Cuddy, former  
professor of U.S. history at the University of North Carolina, and the  
author of a popular pamphlet on the New World Order. If the UN insignia  
on his uniform would have no effect on Michael New's status as an  
American soldier, then why was it so important for him to wear it? If the  
insignia merely identifies a UN operation, then why didn't American  
soldiers serving in Korea wear UN emblems on their uniforms? Why all  
the fuss about a silly little emblem? Cuddy argues that obscuring the  
national identities of troops participating in a UN peacekeeping mission  
and forcing them all to sport UN insignia indicates "a change of  
command or authority." Once the United Nations has troops that it can  
truly call its own, it will have become what its founders wanted it to be --  
"a de facto world government." 
<p> 
"Michael New is an American hero," proclaims Congressman Roscoe  
Bartlett of Maryland. "A twice decorated soldier, Michael New took the  
extraordinary step of jeopardizing a brilliant military career to defend our  
Constitution." Now, if only our Congressmen will show such courage.  
Bartlett and more than 60 of his colleagues are co-sponsoring a bill that  
would make it unlawful to require a member of the U.S. Armed Services  
to wear insignia, indicia, or headgear affirming allegiance to, or  
affiliation with, the United Nations. But why stop there? Why not take  
the one step that really would prevent American soldiers from being  
transferred to the command of an international force? Why not withdraw  
from the United Nations altogether, while we still can?

<h2>Family vs. "Village"</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
First Lady Hillary Clinton and her friends tell us that it takes a village to    
raise a child, but to them "village" is just a code word for Big Brother    
government. 
</i></blockquote>
<P>  
It's a nice sounding proverb: It takes a village to raise a child. But what    
does it really mean? What does Hillary Clinton have in mind when she    
speaks of a "village"? How does she propose to "raise a child"? Do these    
terms mean the same thing to her that they do to the rest of us? Former    
Virginia Secretary of Health and Human Services Kay James contends    
that the First Lady's interpretation of this traditional African proverb is    
anything but traditional.    
<p>    
"Three fundamental problems arise with the use of this proverb," writes    
Mrs. James in the February issue of Imprimis, the monthly journal of    
Hillsdale College. "First, children do not belong to the village or to the    
community or to the government. They belong to parents, and the village    
exists as a resource for these families." The second problem is that the    
village -- the small, closely-knit community many of us grew up in -- "no    
longer exists." The third problem is that liberals think they can replace    
the village of days gone by with "big government."    
<p>    
Mrs. James considers it ironic that "the more our families disintegrate, the    
more violence explodes in our homes and on our streets, the more our    
schools fail the grade, the more this old proverb is repeated." Invoking    
proverbs like a mantra will not change the fact that the village "has been    
utterly and completely destroyed." Mrs. James argues that, "rather than    
work to rebuild the village, we have instead taken the broken bricks of    
families, the mortar of cultural institutions, and the steel of houses of    
worship and used them to build up Town Hall." This, of course, is the    
worst thing we could have done, for our growing dependence on big    
government "has robbed us of the drive so necessary to sustain and    
strengthen the institutions of the village."    
<p>    
Hillary Clinton and like-minded liberals can sing the praises of the    
village, but that doesn't alter the fact that it was their policies that    
destroyed it. "Liberal theology has undermined our faith and destroyed    
the traditional role of churches," declares Mrs. James. "Liberal education    
policies have ravaged our public schools. Liberal social policies have    
sabotaged our families. Liberal public policies have fostered welfare    
dependency encouraged promiscuous behavior, and empowered criminals    
instead of citizens."    
<p>    
Mrs. James contends that Americans today know "the full cost of ceding    
our responsibilities to the federal government." We know that "the    
government cannot be our parents, cannot teach our children about    
responsibility and character, cannot regulate individual behavior, and    
cannot create entrepreneurial opportunities." We know that "the real    
solutions are not political," and that "real change must still come from the    
transformed hearts and souls of individuals."

<h2>
Education Reform
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
According to a national opinion poll conducted by USA Today in 
January, the quality of education in our country is the number-one 
concern for most Americans.
</blockquote></i>


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The quality of education in America is declining because "power in 
educational public policy rests with the producers, not the consumers," 
says Charles Greenawalt of the Commonwealth Foundation in 
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. "Public education should serve the public 
interest and be accountable for its performance, but this is not the case." 
The education establishment "possesses near-monopoly control of this 
area of public policy." Greenawalt argues that the primary objective of 
this establishment is "not to improve and strengthen their performance, 
but to preserve itself, its clout, the status quo, and the resources at its 
disposal. This status quo is facilitated by complex layers of local, state, 
and federal regulations that apply to the schools and are implemented by 
overstaffed and generally unresponsive school district bureaucracies."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Greenawalt calls for "major shifts of authority and control over resources 
from producers to consumers and from experts to civilians. This means 
giving parents, taxpayers, elected officials, and community leaders far 
greater say over what schools need to accomplish, how the schools will 
be held accountable for this task, and how children and schools will be 
matched with one another." One way to do this is by "breaking vast 
school systems into smaller and more manageable units," says 
Greenawalt. "Consolidation in many areas has gone too far [resulting in] 
numerous school districts that are too large . . . to educate students 
effectively."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For our educational system to be successful again, there must be 
reasonable standards of performance for students and teachers, genuine 
competition among the schools, and a renewed sense of professionalism 
among educators. Standards must "spell out in clear, unambiguous terms 
what students should learn and be able to do before they graduate," says 
Greenawalt. For standards to be effective, there must be "reliable and 
accurate assessments of student and school performance vis-a-vis those 
standards [which presupposes] trustworthy information about student 
performance [and] accountability mechanisms that will invoke 
meaningful consequences for all school personnel."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Noting that "children differ substantially in learning styles, temperament, 
and personal preference," Greenawalt argues that, "rather than attempting 
to standardize all schools, the state should welcome and promote 
educational diversity or pluralism. Let schools compete with one another 
based on their distinctive programs." According to Greenawalt, "School 
choice is an essential element for any comprehensive educational reform 
that is to be meaningful and long-lived. Families must be able to select 
their children's schools from a broad and varied array of choices."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Greenawalt says that teachers need to start thinking of themselves as 
individuals again. "Uniform salary schedules that treat everyone alike, 
regardless of performance, have no place in a true profession," he argues. 
"Likewise, the ability to strike and the presence of lifetime tenure are also 
antithetical to true professionalism. Schools must be operated for the 
benefit of their consumers -- the students -- not their producers."

<h2>
Conservation Economics
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
If environmental activists really cared about preserving endangered 
species, they wouldn't let an ideological commitment to socialism stand 
in the way.
</blockquote></i>

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Since 1970, conservationists have painted a dismal picture of an 
increasing struggle for survival of wildlife, with one species after another 
being pushed to the brink of extinction," says Robert J. Smith of the 
Competitive Enterprise Institute. "Why are some species disappearing 
and others thriving?" Smith argues that "the problem of overexploitation 
or overharvesting is a result of the resources being under public rather 
than private ownership." In the January issue of his organization's 
monthly newsletter, "UpDate," Smith distinguishes between "two totally 
different forms of property rights and ownership: public, communal, or 
open-access common property vs. private property. Wherever we have 
public ownership we find overuse, waste, and extinction; but private 
ownership results in sustained-yield use and preservation."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Wildlife problems resulting from public ownership have been "especially 
prevalent in America," says Smith, but less so in other parts of the world. 
"In Europe, native wildlife often belongs to private landowners or is 
managed under a combination of private and public property. Some 
European countries have fewer problems of overexploitation of wildlife, 
regardless of population pressures and economic and political systems." 
There's a lesson to be learned here, says Smith.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
An example of "how private ownership can successfully preserve wildlife 
is found on game ranches, hunting preserves, safari parks, and animal and 
bird farms." Smith contends that "these game ranches produce many 
positive results. Many of the animals they stock are rapidly disappearing 
in their native countries because of pressures resulting from a rapidly 
expanding human population. Indeed, some of the more spectacular and 
most sought-after big-game mammals may now have healthier and more 
stable populations on game ranches than in their native countries."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The reluctance of conservationists to embrace private ownership of 
wildlife is one of the biggest threats to the preservation of endangered 
species. "If the profits gained by giving hunters access to exotic game can 
provide the economic incentive for landowners to manage the animals on 
a sustained-yield basis, some species will be saved," says Smith. He notes 
that "the protection provided at some of the parks, preserves, and gardens 
has actually produced a glut of some animals. There have been well-
publicized efforts by some preserves to return their surplus animals to 
Africa." Smith predicts that "in the future the developing countries will 
be restocked with their native fauna from specimens now thriving on 
game ranches and preserves."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservationists need to overcome their slavish devotion to big 
government. "The problems of environmental degradation, 
overexploitation of natural resources, and depletion of wildlife all derive 
from their existence as common property resources," says Robert J. 
Smith. "Wherever we have exclusive private ownership, whether it is 
organized around a profit-seeking or nonprofit undertaking, there are 
incentives for the private owners to preserve the resource. Self-interest 
drives private property owners to careful management of their resource."

Troubled by the Issues
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
When it comes to covering political campaigns, the members of the 
media have a way of focusing on the personalities of the candidates and 
ignoring the issues. Maybe it's because they don't want us to think about 
what's really at stake.
</blockquote></i>


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


What are the issues in the 1996 Presidential election? The deployment of 
American troops to Bosnia is one. The court-martial of Army Specialist 
Michael New for refusing to wear the United Nations uniform is another. 
The UN itself is a big issue -- the funding of it, its so-called peacemaking 
efforts, its impact on U.S. sovereignty. Serious voters want to know if our 
next President will acknowledge that America has no strategic interest in 
Bosnia and bring our troops home. Will he make amends to Michael New 
and take steps to ensure that no U.S. soldier is ever again subjected to 
foreign command? Will he oppose independent taxing authority for the 
UN? Will he oppose U.S. funding for UN military ventures? Will he 
oppose treaties -- like the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 
UN Convention on the Rights of the Child -- that threaten U.S. 
sovereignty?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What about NAFTA, GATT, and the World Trade Organization? The 
Mexican bailout? Illegal immigration and multilingualism? These are 
issues of major concern to many Americans. Will our next President 
acknowledge the real impact of so-called free-trade treaties on our 
economy? Will the jobs of American workers mean more to him than the 
bad investments of New York banks? Will he cut off all taxpayer benefits 
to illegal aliens and support a moratorium on legal immigration until the 
problem of illegals can be addressed? Will he endorse English as our 
official language and withdraw support for bilingual programs that retard 
the assimilation of immigrants?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What about education and crime-fighting? Presidential candidates like to 
talk about these issues, even though both are properly handled at the local 
level. Will our next President acknowledge state supremacy in these 
matters? Will he terminate the unconstitutional federal intervention in 
education by abolishing the Department of Education and repealing 
Goals 2000? Will he condemn the killings carried out by federal agents at 
Ruby Ridge and Waco, and make sure that Americans are never again 
terrorized by their own government? Will he oppose legislation -- like the 
so-called anti-terrorism bill -- that would authorize federal agents to 
violate the constitutionally-protected liberties of Americans? Will he 
oppose the government's taking of private lands for bogus environmental 
reasons?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Where does he stand on term limits, secret pay raises for Congressmen, 
and Congressional pensions? What's his position on taxpayer handouts to 
wealthy organizations such as Planned Parenthood and AARP? Does he 
support or reject affirmative action quotas and set-asides? These are just 
some of the issues that the press passes over as it plays up personalities, 
polls, and party platitudes. But serious voters know what the issues are, 
and they want a candidate who will address them.

<h2>
ENVIRONMENTALISM
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
"By the end of the 1980s, environmental bills accounted for nearly one-
fifth of bills presented to Congress and almost one-quarter of those 
enacted into law."
</blockquote></i>
<P>



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
                            
"The government's environmental activism has been costly," writes 
Jonathan Adler of the Competitive Enterprise Institute. "The 
Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that Americans spend 
well over $150 billion per year complying with environmental 
regulations." In a new book called Environmentalism at the Crossroads, 
published by the Capital Research Center, Adler argues that businesses 
trying to absorb the costs of compliance "are likely to pass on the cost to 
consumers by raising the price of their products. And, when they are 
confronted by the uncertainties of statutory interpretation and the 
regulatory enforcement of environmental law, they may decide to slow 
the development and application of new technologies."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The cost of environmental regulation continues to increase, even as more 
and more Americans are questioning its effectiveness, "particularly in the 
area of risk reduction." Adler contends that "attempting to improve 
environmental quality in one area can hurt the environment in other 
areas." Even worse, regulations can sometimes have an effect quite the 
opposite of what was intended, as has happened with the Endangered 
Species Act. Adler notes that "landowners lose the right to use their land 
as they see fit when an endangered animal is discovered on it. 
Landowners cannot build or enlarge their homes, plant crops, or cut down 
trees. Rather than protect wildlife, the Endangered Species Act punishes 
landowners, in effect, for creating or maintaining a species habitat. The 
Act creates disincentives for protecting endangered species," says Adler, 
with the result that "landowners who find an endangered species on their 
property may well decide to destroy it and its habitat before it's 
discovered by federal authorities."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adler asserts that "many policy experts and the public now recognize the 
failings of much environmental policy." Nevertheless, he says, 
"Washington's environmental lobbies are unyielding." They know that 
regulatory reform is needed to establish accurate methods of risk 
assessment, proscribe unfunded mandates, and protect private property 
rights, but they refuse to admit it. Rather than harness the time-tested 
incentives of the free enterprise system in the service of their mission, 
they remain blindly committed to government intervention. "Washington 
environmental lobbyists steadfastly oppose risk assessment, relief from 
unfunded mandates, and greater protection of property," Adler observes. 
"Environmentalists do not see that the public's interest in economic 
common sense and fairness is compatible with support for a clean 
environment."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Without meaningful reform, however, regulators will continue to target 
risks that have "public relations or political value," in the process 
spending "millions of dollars that do comparatively little to improve 
public health and environmental quality." They will continue to impose 
unfunded mandates on state and local governments, with the result that 
"local priorities must be subordinated to Washington's dictates." And they 
will continue to issue environmental regulations that "override private 
land-use decisions," thereby violating the "takings clause" of the Fifth 
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

<h2>
Environmental Myths
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
"Mainstream thinking asserts that we must sacrifice at least some of our 
prosperity in order to protect the environment, " observes a noted 
economist. "Fortunately, this mainstream thinking is wrong."
</blockquote></i>



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"We can have both a growing economy and an improving environment," 
declares John Semmens of the Laissez-Faire Institute in Chandler, 
Arizona. In an article entitled "Prosperity Without Pollution," in the 
March issue of "The Freeman," Semmens suggests that "a growing 
economy may well provide the very means needed to improve the 
environment. 'Sacrifice' may not only be unnecessary; it may be 
counterproductive."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Semmens cites several "erroneous premises" of mainstream 
environmental thinking that pose obstacles not only to prosperity but to 
environmental improvement as well. One false premise is the idea that 
anything "natural" is better than anything "artificial." Civilization itself is 
artificial, Semmens observes, but far superior to the state of nature. The 
"artificial" laws and technology of civilization allow us "to lead lives that 
are less violent, painful, and precarious than would be natural. 
'Environmentalism' itself is an artifact of civilization. The abundance 
generated by our technologically advanced civilization allows people to 
contemplate more than just survival."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The idea that resources are finite is another false premise. Things do not 
even become "resources" until humans find a use for them and thereby 
give them value. The scarcity of any given resource is simply a challenge 
to be overcome. "The high prices of scarce resources stimulate the search 
for better or cheaper alternatives for meeting the same human wants," 
says Semmens. "So, in the final analysis, it is not the 'finiteness' of any 
substance that is critical. The critical factor is the scope of the human 
imagination. This scope seems to be getting broader. The accelerating 
pace of technological advancement should give us confidence that, 
barring the implementation of oppressive government meddling, we are 
not likely to run short of intellectual resources in the foreseeable future."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The so-called population bomb is another fallacy. "It is not population, 
per se, that could pose a problem for humanity, but the political and 
social institutions that affect human behavior," says Semmens. "In this 
regard, the paternalistic welfare state is a serious problem. Government 
programs that entitle people to consume without their having to produce 
turns them into drones and parasites." The danger here is that "the burden 
of the parasitic portion of the population may overwhelm the output 
capacity of the productive portion."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The biggest fallacy of all is the idea that big government is the answer to 
environmental problems, real or imagined. "Government lacks adequate 
information on the subjective values of individuals, on the world's 
continuously changing circumstances, and on what the future might 
bring," says Semmens. "Further, government lacks sufficient incentives 
to avoid mistakes. The burdens of its errors fall on others. Its failures 
serve as a rationale for further meddling." Semmens insists that 
"prosperity and a cleaner environment" depend on "human creativity," 
which cannot flourish in a society stifled by government control.

<h2>
Constitution Not Outmoded
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
It's a familiar refrain. The Constitution, we're told, was designed for an 
18th-century agrarian society, not for the complex, technological world 
we live in today.
</blockquote></i>




<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"The Constitution is based on three timeless truths," wrote Jackson 
Pemberton in an essay published in "The Freeman" during our 
bicentennial year. "First, it is founded on the fact that it is necessary, in a 
society, that the citizen must either control himself by his own moral 
self-discipline, or he must be restrained so that he cannot abuse his 
liberty. Second, it is the nature of man to seek recognition, then 
influence, and then power in his relationships to his fellows. Third, it is 
the nature of man to work untiringly for himself when he is confident in 
the usefulness of his effort. Those are the footings of the Constitution, 
and there is nothing there that is either 18th century or agrarian!"
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In his essay, recently reprinted by the Foundation for Economic 
Education in a collection called The Foundations of American 
Constitutional Government, Pemberton argued that the Constitution was 
founded "upon an exquisite recognition of the dual disposition of man, 
his propensity for good and his capacity for evil." The objective of the 
Founding Fathers was "to place the forces of human nature in a 
framework which would cause those forces to lift man, to protect and 
release his conscience, his will, his talents, and his noble desires, and at 
the same time would discourage and punish him in his vices."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Founding Fathers knew that, if Americans should ever "turn from 
morality and good religion, they would also turn from liberty," wrote 
Pemberton, "for, if man is to be free, he must control himself." For that 
reason, they strove to make sure that "religion should be thoroughly 
protected and even encouraged." They did not intend for "any particular 
religion to have the advantage over another, but that the citizens' rights 
to complete liberty of private and public belief and practice should in no 
way be infringed."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Founding Fathers, Pemberton explained, "set up the plan of 
government so that its powers were restricted, separated, and dispersed 
throughout the states in order to defeat the tendency of men to 
consolidate power and ordain themselves rulers over the people." They 
then applied "the checks and balances to set each branch of government 
as a watchman over the other two, and gave each certain prerogatives so 
as to place the ambition of self-aggrandizing men in opposition to the 
ambition of other similar men."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Founding Fathers recognized that "man is most inclined to produce 
an abundance when his property rights are held inviolate," wrote 
Pemberton. "Man, by nature, will strive with great energy and 
innovation to improve himself . . . so long as he has confidence that he 
will be allowed to enjoy the fruits of his labors." The Founding Fathers 
disdained "excessive taxation and regulation," because they knew that 
"the freest economies were the greatest source of plenty. "

<title>Duplantier: Creeping Socialism -- 4/12/96</title>

<h2>
Creeping Socialism
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
Socialism is based on "a simple assumption: that certain people know 
better what is best for all other creatures, and that such people possess the 
right to enforce their 'enlightened ' beliefs because they shall lead the rest 
of us to a 'perfect' world."
</blockquote></i>




<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When they drafted the U.S. Constitution, our Founding Fathers "created a 
framework which sought to limit secular laws, rules, and regulations to 
the necessary minimum," notes Balint Vazsonyi in an essay titled "The 
Battle for America's Soul," published in the Winter issue of a journal 
called "Common Sense." "They recognized that the fewer the rules, the 
broader the potential agreement. Broad agreement, in turn, results in less 
strife. Less strife leaves people free to create and accomplish. The fewer 
obstacles placed in the path of individuals, the less energy wasted in 
trying to overcome them."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Today, however, individual opportunity has given way to group 
entitlement. "Instead of increased productivity, efforts are always directed 
toward increasing demands. These demands are for unearned 
participation in, and distributions from, the accomplishments of those 
who produce the nation's goods," says Vazsonyi. What results is "a 
downward spiral. With incentives shrinking, less and less is produced; 
consequently, there is less and less to distribute. This, in a nutshell, is 
why welfare states invariably increase poverty."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why don't Americans recognize creeping socialism for what it is? 
Socialism "persuades its intended victims that it has people's best interest 
in mind, that it seeks peace, justice, and equality, that it is motivated by 
caring and compassion. Its ability to camouflage true intent and adapt to a 
specific scenario is matchless," says Vazsonyi. It doesn't prohibit free 
speech; it establishes a "politically correct vocabulary." It doesn't impede 
individual opportunity; it promotes "affirmative action." It doesn't 
confiscate private property; it protects "the environment "
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The evidence of creeping socialism is all around us. "The Constitution 
does not provide for group rights," says Vazsonyi. "Yet, a steadily 
growing number of groups is being granted an increasing number of 
rights. Defense, for which the Constitution does provide, has been 
surrounded by an atmosphere of derision and hostility; the effectiveness 
of our armed forces is being diminished through inappropriate use." The 
executive and judicial branches of our federal government have usurped 
legislative power. Laws defining so-called "hate crimes" have narrowed 
the boundaries of free speech. Environmental regulations have 
circumscribed private property rights.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Education used to be based on the best available information, the 
consensus of generations, and rewards designed to extract the best effort 
from all participants," observes Vazsonyi. "Currently, information is 
being replaced by propaganda, consensus by the whim and din of activist 
groups, best effort by primitive egalitarianism." Americans are no longer 
judged by their abilities, but by membership in favored classes. Our 
traditional standards of morality "are being displaced by doctrines which 
do not even recognize the existence of values; the spirit of voluntarism is 
being choked by coercion." Sadly, says Vazsonyi, all these symptoms of 
creeping socialism are endorsed by American liberals.

<title>Duplantier: TAX-FUNDED LOBBYING -- 4/15/96</title></head>

<h2>
TAX-FUNDED LOBBYING
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
Do you ever wonder where your federal income taxes go? Billions go to 
programs that subsidize special interest groups lobbying the government 
to increase spending! Consider the implications of that vicious circle 
when you file your 1040 today.
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"The federal budget provides numerous slush funds that can be used to 
subsidize the lobbying and political activities of special-interest groups," reports Charles Griffin of the Heritage Foundation. "The agendas of these tax-subsidized groups tend toward bigger government, more spending,
and increased regulation. Every American is forced to finance this system 
that allows well-connected Washington-based groups to use taxpayer 
funds to advance political causes to which many Americans object."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
AmeriCorps received $427 million from American taxpayers in 1995. 
Griffin claims that "several AmeriCorps programs have engaged in 
advocacy and direct partisan politics at the expense of the taxpayers," and 
in violation of the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993. 
Also in 1995, the Legal Services Corporation funneled $400 million of 
our money to private groups that "engage in political and lobbying 
activities, often at the expense of the genuine legal services needed by the 
poor." Griffin describes the Legal Services Corporation as "the legal 
pillar of the welfare state," litigating and lobbying to expand the number 
of welfare recipients and drive up costs by "hundreds of billions of 
dollars."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nearly $200 million was allocated for Title X Family Planning in 1995. 
"Despite the fact that much of Planned Parenthood's agenda is repulsive 
to large numbers of Americans," observes Griffin, "this high-profile 
political organization receives a substantial portion of its revenue each 
year" from programs administered under Title X. The National 
Endowment for the Humanities used the $180 million it received in 1995 
to promote "a liberal political and ideological agenda," says Griffin. 
"Abuse of federal grant dollars for political purposes is rampant in the 
National Endowment's most prominent current project, the so-called 
National Conversation. At the cost of millions of dollars, the endowment 
is subsidizing such special-interest groups as the National Council on 
Aging, the American Bar Association, and the American Library 
Association."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The $75 million allocated to the Market Promotion Program in 1995 for 
developing "commercial export markets for U.S. agricultural 
commodities" wound up in the hands of "some of the largest and most 
vocal special interests in the country," Griffin charges. Recipients of 
Market Promotion Program grants "opposed bipartisan efforts to reform 
farm subsidies. They fought successfully against the effort to eliminate 
[the Market Protection Program] outright, and they also fought reforms 
designed to decrease taxpayer subsidies to farmers, particularly large 
corporate farms. Once again, all of these self-serving efforts were 
subsidized unwittingly by the American taxpayer."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Griffin insists that "government funding of political activism is 
indefensible. Yet, hundreds of groups now receive government grants 
which are used, and used effectively, to subsidize their political 
activities." The question is, why do we put up with this outrage?

<title>Duplantier: COST OF REGULATIONS -- 4/16/96</title></head>

<h2>
COST OF REGULATIONS
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
Federal regulations raise the cost of the goods and services we purchase 
by $400 billion annually. In other words, federal regulations cost the 
average American family $4, 000 per year!
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"This year, OSHA will spend about $300 million and send out some 
2,000 inspectors across the country," reports John Hood of the Heritage 
Foundation. But those 2,000 snoops will inspect fewer than 10 percent of 
the six million workplaces in America, and are not likely to have any 
beneficial impact even at those locations. OSHA's workplace safety 
crusade "has been and will always be dwarfed by private-sector 
initiatives," says Hood. OSHA has "little value to add to the worker 
safety picture. But its costs -- measured in lower productivity and wages, 
as well as higher prices and taxes -- are significant."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Gary Becker of the Hoover Institution explains the impact of minimum 
wage hikes. "Higher labor costs reduce employment," he says. "A higher 
minimum will further reduce the employment opportunities of workers 
with few skills." In other words, teenagers, high school dropouts, and 
other low-skilled workers will lose their jobs if "their productivity is not 
high enough to justify the cost to employers." When workers lose their 
jobs, they stop paying taxes and start receiving unemployment or welfare 
benefits.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Richard Lesher of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce describes the 
Americans with Disabilities Act as "yet another weapon in the hands of 
disgruntled employees with personal axes to grind." Besides the cost of 
nuisance lawsuits, there is "the expense of retrofitting tens of thousands 
of workplaces and public facilities with wheelchair ramps, elevators, 
toilet stalls, and other special provisions to accommodate people with a 
wide variety of handicaps," says Lesher. "Together with the soaring cost 
of litigation, the Americans with Disabilities Act is proving to be a major 
expense for both public and private enterprises."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U.S. Government banned the use of CFCs in aerosol spray cans in 
1978, and an international treaty phased out their use entirely in all 
industrial nations at the end of 1995. Jane Shaw and Richard Stroup of 
the Political Economy Research Center say these drastic actions are the 
result of hysteria, not scientific documentation. They argue that it's 
foolish for our federal government to prohibit the production of the 
nontoxic CFCs "used in millions of automobiles and refrigerators" when 
the available alternatives are "more costly, more corrosive to cooling 
systems, less dependable, and less manageable. Some even appear to be 
less safe." The benefits of halting CFC production are negligible, but the 
costs are likely to be extraordinarily high.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Just as our forefathers rebelled against 'taxation without representation,' 
today, private property owners are revolting over 'confiscation without 
compensation,'" says Congressman Billy Tauzin, author of the Private 
Property Owners Bill of Rights. "Clearly, the federal government has 
become our master rather than our servant," says Tauzin. "But American 
property owners . . . are fighting back."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These are just a few examples of the regulatory abuses financed by our 
taxes.

<h2>
BIG GOVERNMENT THREATENS RIGHTS
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
The Federal Government compels us to fork over fully one-third of our 
income, and it uses that money to infringe on the civil liberties protected 
by our Bill of Rights.
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects our right to 
practice our religious faith freely; and yet, the Supreme Court has often 
invoked this amendment to justify decisions restricting our freedom of 
religion. The nation's highest Court has prohibited the teaching of 
religion in public schools, as well as the recitation of prayers and the 
reading of the Bible.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Second Amendment protects the right of the individual to own and 
make use of guns. Liberal politicians view gun ownership as an 
interference with the expansion of federal power, which of course it is, 
for an armed citizenry is much more difficult to subjugate than one 
without weapons. Those who don't like the Second Amendment exploit 
every public tragedy involving firearms as propaganda for tighter 
restrictions on their use.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Our right to privacy, protected by the Third and Fourth Amendments, is 
also under attack. The Federal Government seems determined to increase 
its control over all of us by prying into our daily lives. Tax collectors and 
regulatory agents have been snooping on us for years; and now, in the 
name of combating terrorism, the President demands wiretapping 
privileges for federal agents to investigate any suspected felony. There 
are 1,300 federal felonies. You could be guilty of one right now without 
even knowing it.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Fifth Amendment not only protects us against double jeopardy and 
self-incrimination; it also prohibits the confiscation of our property by the 
Federal Government without proper compensation. Yet, today, 
Americans frequently find their property devalued by governmental 
edicts restricting the use of it -- or even taken from them altogether in the 
interest of some putative public good.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Sixth Amendment guarantees our right to a trial by jury in a criminal 
case. How juries are selected and instructed, however, often determines 
how effective they are. Unfortunately, jurors are routinely screened on 
the basis of their philosophical or religious beliefs, and those who show 
any propensity for questioning the evidence in the case or the validity of 
the law are usually dismissed posthaste. The Seventh Amendment 
protects our right to a trial by jury in a civil suit, but the growth of 
regulatory agencies has enabled unelected bureaucrats to bypass that 
safeguard -- and instead act as prosecutor, judge, and jury. There are over 
13 million federal bureaucrats meddling in the daily affairs of American 
citizens.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some federal judges and regulatory agents simply disregard the Eighth 
Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable fines and punishments. Some 
also ignore the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, which stipulate that the 
people and the States reserve to themselves all rights not expressly 
granted to the Federal Government. One thing is clear: If Americans want 
to retain the liberties protected by our Bill of Rights, we'd better make our 
voices heard.

<h2>
UNCHANGING TRUTHS
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
The best protection against the designs of demagogues, do-gooders, and 
other self-styled reformers is a  firm grasp of eternal verities.
</blockquote></i>
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Greek philosopher Aristotle argued that the sovereignty of the law 
must supersede the sovereignty of the ruler. The law is a higher authority 
than the ruler because it; proceeds from a higher authority. "He who 
commands that law should rule [commands] that God and reason alone 
should rule," said Aristotle. Democracies inevitably decline when they 
cease to respect this higher authority and place the interests of any one 
group above the common good.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The English philosopher John Locke went to great lengths to distinguish 
liberty from license and to demonstrate that the law is the liberator, not 
the oppressor, of man: "Law, in its true notion, is not so much the 
limitation as the direction of a free and intelligent agent to his proper 
interest, and prescribes no farther than is for the general good of those 
under that law." Locke argued that "the end of the law is not to abolish or 
restrain but to preserve and enlarge freedom," though he emphasized that 
freedom is not "a liberty for every man to do what he [pleases]."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In order to live, legally, at someone else's expense, it is necessary to turn 
the law into "an instrument of plunder," observed the French economist 
Frederic Bastiat. No matter how noble the justification, once the premise 
is accepted that a government can expropriate the wealth of some of its 
citizens and dispense it to others, theft has been legalized, and the signal 
has been sent that nothing is secure. Bastiat considered this the greatest 
evil to which any society can be subjected, but recognized it as the 
ultimate goal of all greedy men and do-gooders.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
French social psychologist Gustave Le Bon argued that all forms of 
government enshrine one or the other of "two different and opposing 
fundamental principles -- individualism and collectivism. By 
individualism, man is left to himself; his initiative is carried to a 
maximum and that of the state to a minimum. By collectivism a man's 
least actions are directed by the state . . . the individual possesses no 
initiative; all the acts of his life are mapped out." Le Bon had no 
difficulty determining which of these two conflicting principles leads to 
greater results: "The peoples among whom individualism is most highly 
developed are by this fact alone at the head of civilization."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
American patriot John T. Flynn urged his countrymen to "stop 
apologizing for our capitalist society." We should take no more steps 
down the road to socialism, he said, and turn out of office any politician 
who tries to lead us in that direction. Flynn pointed out "that we are in a 
social war, and that we must fight it as such." He said we should "put an 
end to the orgy of spending that is rapidly bankrupting the nation," quit 
letting bureaucrats plan our economy, and instead let "our free system of 
private enterprise operate at its fullest capacity."

<h2>
GAMBLING
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
Gaming fever has been sweeping the country for nearly 10 years now -- 
long enough for its true impact to be measured.
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It starts with a state lottery, the proceeds pledged to education or some 
such worthy cause. Then the gambling boats roll up the river, supposedly 
regulated to lessen their mischief. At last, the land-based casinos appear, 
promising an economic renaissance for distressed communities. But it 
soon becomes apparent that legalized gambling is not the golden-egg-
laying goose it was claimed to be. The proceeds from the lottery are 
never as high as hoped for, and the worthy cause that was supposed to 
benefit often finds its annual appropriation from the state legislature 
reduced by a like amount. The riverboats, discovering all kinds of 
unanticipated navigational hazards, ultimately drop their anchors 
permanently. The land-based casinos usurp the patronage of local 
retailers and burden city coffers with the cost of vices generated by 
gaming.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Casino gambling has been sold as the answer to economic problems 
everywhere it has been tried. But casinos serve as a gigantic sump, 
sucking sales from surrounding businesses," asserts Blake Hurst in the 
April issue of The American Enterprise magazine. "People who spend 
money at a casino can't spend it at [local restaurants], or the ballpark, or 
the amusement park. Gambling cannibalizes existing businesses, and the 
overall economic benefit to the economy is nil."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The economic impact is actually negative, when the cost of social vices 
encouraged by gambling is factored in. One expert cited by Hurst 
"estimates that the average gambler with a problem has from $53,000 to 
$92,000 in gambling-related debt." Another authority on the subject 
reports that "the societal costs imposed by each problem gambler are over 
$13,000, with some estimates running as high as $52,000 annually." A 
survey of wanton wagerers "found that 75 percent of pathological 
gamblers have committed a felony to support their habit." According to 
Gamblers Anonymous, there are as many as 10 million problem gamblers 
in America.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"The economic case against gambling is clear," says Hurst. "Gambling 
doesn't create economic wealth, but rather transfers wealth from existing 
businesses to those lucky or influential enough to receive gambling 
monopolies from the state. Gambling increases political corruption and 
crime, and is a strikingly regressive means of raising revenue." That, 
believe it or not, is just the beginning of what's wrong with legalized 
gambling.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps most damaging is the misleading message that legalized 
gambling sends to the citizenry, especially the young. "When the state 
removes the stigma from gambling by promoting it as a way to help 
education, people who have never gambled develop the habit. 
Governments may not be able to control vice, but surely they ought not to 
encourage it," says Blake Hurst. "When governments present riverboat 
casinos as economic development, they diminish those who build farms 
and factories. When states spend millions urging their citizens to play the 
lottery, they devalue the efforts of those who work hard and invest 
wisely."

<title>Duplantier: TAIWAN -- 4/22/96</title></head>

<h2>
TAIWAN
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
The missile tests and naval exercises that China conducted in March 
were meant to intimidate the people of Taiwan, and certainly 
accomplished that objective. But they may have had another, unintended 
impact: reminding the rest of the world that the People's Republic is not 
to be trusted.
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"On Taiwan, the people enjoy freedom of speech, freedom to choose their 
politicians, and the freedom to engage in a market economy," says Robert 
Morris, chairman and president of America's Future, the producer of this 
broadcast. "On the mainland, in the People's Republic of China, people 
are repressed politically and economically by a brutal communist 
dictatorship. Any dissension results in jail." The dramatically superior 
living conditions of the free Chinese on Taiwan are a daily affront to the 
mainland communists.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
China's missile testing exercise amounted to a de facto blockade of the 
sea and air lanes leading to Taiwan, which derives 40 percent of its gross 
domestic product from exports. Shipping had to be diverted from the 
country's two major ports, and air flights had to be re-routed. The 
psychological impact was even greater. The Taiwanese stock market has 
fallen 625 points since China's first series of threatening missile tests in 
July 1995, dropping 62 points in one day after the second series of tests 
was announced in March. "There have been shows of force before," says 
Morris, "but not in recent history has anything so directly affected 
Taiwan's commerce and its people."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Taiwan is an "unlikely success story," observes Morris. "Isolated off the 
south coast of China, the 19,000-square-mile island has blossomed into a 
free and vigorous country. It had become by 1990 the world's 13th-
largest trading nation. During the postwar period, its economy grew more 
rapidly than that of any other nation -- an annual average of over eight 
percent." Morris reports that Taiwan's west coast "is covered with all the 
trappings of a successful industrialized nation. Everywhere new suburbs 
have sprung up, linked by modern highways. Rice farms, dating back 
hundreds of years, now sit next to new, modern factories that ship 
products worldwide."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Morris says Taiwan's 21 million people "increasingly enjoy a lifestyle 
similar to those in the West. Its per capita annual income of $11,000 
ranks it among the world's top 25 nations, and stands in sharp contrast to 
the mainland average of $370." But the freedom and prosperity of 
Taiwan are "threatened by the hostile People's Republic of China, with a 
nuclear arsenal and the world's largest armed force. The communists 
maintain unbendingly that Taiwan is no more than a breakaway province, 
arguing that the free Chinese must acknowledge Beijing's sovereignty 
and submit to 'peaceful unification.'"
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Robert Morris of America's Future recommends that the United States 
"increase arms sales to Taiwan and help the free Chinese create a modern 
defense system." He says the United States "should also expand 
economic and trade cooperation, and encourage other nations to accept 
Taiwan into the world community."

<h2>
CHINESE BANDITS
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
The communists in China may have nothing but contempt for the 
democratic values of the West, but that doesn't stop them from lusting 
after the prosperity that only a free society can attain.
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The communists in China long to get their hands on the wealth of Hong 
Kong and Taiwan. They don't seem to understand how that wealth was 
created, or how quickly it would evaporate under communist control. Nor 
do they realize that China itself could be equally prosperous, if they 
would only allow their people the freedom to enjoy the fruits of their own 
labor.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The communists in China also covet the wealth of the United States. 
Since they're not willing to take the steps necessary to create such wealth 
in their own country, however, they've decided to steal ours. The Chinese 
government is actively pirating products and technology patented, 
copyrighted, and trademarked in America. The Chinese have stolen 
computer programs, pharmaceutical products, agricultural chemicals, 
musical recordings, videos, automotive designs, and other intellectual 
properties created by, and rightfully belonging to, American citizens and 
businesses.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These works of genius are a tribute to the remarkable potential of our 
free-enterprise system. They are the envy of the world, and a mainstay of 
our economy. They are, of course, available for sale to China. And China 
is certainly welcome to compete fairly with us by creating similar 
products on its own. That would involve hard work, however, and a 
liberalization of the Chinese economy that might prove dangerous for the 
slave masters in Beijing. So, instead, China simply copies American 
products illegally. Chinese factories churn out counterfeit CDs, videos, 
and computer programs by the thousands every day, selling their bootleg 
booty around the world.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These Chinese bandits are undermining the markets of American 
manufacturers to the tune of $1 billion per year. That's how much their 
piracy of U.S. intellectual property is estimated to cost our economy in 
lost exports. Lost exports mean lost jobs, in this case as many as 20,000. 
Unfortunately, American businessmen anxious to tap into the vast 
Chinese market are playing right into the hands of these conniving 
thieves. The experience of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation is just 
one example of how Chinese communists deceive American businessmen 
in order to steal U.S. technology and equipment. By pretending to be in 
the market for a fleet of passenger planes, the Chinese were able to 
negotiate rock-bottom prices on the items that they really wanted -- U.S. 
equipment that would enable them to augment their military capabilities. 
Once they had that equipment in hand, they canceled the order for planes.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Last year, U.S. negotiators persuaded the Chinese to sign yet another 
agreement promising to put an end to their piracy. Getting them to sign 
was easy. Getting them to honor the agreement is another thing. U.S. 
officials keep threatening to impose trade sanctions, but the Chinese don't 
take them seriously, and go right on stealing.

<h2>
REP. SMITH ON CHINA
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
During hearings last May on the coercive population control program 
that Communist China has conducted for at least two decades, the 
chairman of a House Subcommittee posed the question. Should such a 
monstrous abuse of human rights affect our relations with that barbaric 
country?
</blockquote></i>

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congressman Christopher Smith, chairman of the House Subcommittee 
on International Operations and Human Rights, began his opening 
remarks by noting that Communist China "routinely compels women to 
abort their 'unauthorized' unborn children. The usual method," he 
observed, "is intense 'persuasion' using all of the economic, social, and 
psychological tools a totalitarian State has at its disposal. When these 
methods fail, the woman is taken physically to the abortion mill. Forced 
abortions are often performed very late in pregnancy, even in the ninth 
month." The final indignity is forced sterilization for the woman or her 
husband.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Forced abortion was properly considered a crime against humanity at the 
Nuremberg war crimes tribunal," Congressman Smith continued. "It is 
employed regularly with chilling effectiveness and unbearable pain upon 
women in the People's Republic of China. Women in China are required 
to obtain a birth coupon before conceiving a child. Chinese women are 
hounded by the population control police and even their menstrual cycles 
are publicly monitored as one means of ensuring compliance. "
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congressman Smith reported that the communist government in China 
has recently "issued a new law on eugenics which is now taking effect 
and which nationalizes discrimination against the handicapped. In a move 
that is eerily reminiscent of Nazi Germany, the Communist Chinese 
Government is implementing forced abortion against handicapped 
children and forced sterilization against parents who simply do not 
measure up in the eyes of the State. Despite all of this," said Smith, "the 
United Nations Population Fund continues to provide funds, materiel, 
people [and the] shield of respectability that the Chinese program so 
desperately wants."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Smith chastised the head of the UN Population Fund for insisting that 
China's birth control program is voluntary. "This is unmitigated nonsense 
and a big lie," said the congressman. "Degrading a few men, women, and 
children may be of no great matter for the Chinese communist regime, 
which has long regarded homicide and torture as among the basic tools of 
statecraft," conceded Smith, but that doesn't explain the willingness of 
Westerners to overlook -- or even facilitate -- such abuses. "So the most 
shocking thing about forced abortions and sterilization in China is not 
that they happen," said Smith, "but that otherwise humane societies such 
as the United States might forcibly return people who have managed to 
escape from them."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is exactly what our current government has done. "The Clinton 
administration, which campaigned on a human rights platform that was 
justly critical of some of the refugee policies of its predecessors," said 
Smith, "quickly reversed course and began mass forcible repatriations of 
people who had escaped from China." The President has thus made the 
American people a party to the slaughter of innocents in China.

<P><blockquote><i>  
Thousands of children will die in communist China's state-run 
orphanages this year, and it won't be any accident.

</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A former research specialist with the U.S. Census Bureau reports that 
"Chinese orphans are given sleeping pills instead of food, tied to cribs 
and chairs, left unchanged when soiled, denied medical care, and allowed 
to die of neglect." John Aird, author of a new book called "Slaughter of 
the Innocents: Coercive Birth Control in China," charges that "as many as 
90 percent of the children admitted to some institutions die there." That's 
because "China's leaders consider these children 'surplus' population. 
They try to prevent their birth by forced abortion." Chinese mothers-to-be 
who refuse to submit to government-mandated abortions are fined, 
beaten, imprisoned, and deprived of their homes and property. Even if 
they manage to deliver their babies alive, the newborns are still in danger. 
Writing in the April issue of The American Enterprise magazine, Aird 
asserts that Chinese doctors "work under orders by the authorities to kill 
all babies born without government permission."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More than 14 million abortions will be performed in communist China 
this year, and American taxpayers will pay for many of them. The U.S. 
Government contributes to the United Nations Fund for Population 
Activities, which supports China's coercive birth control program. "When 
the coercion in the program became undeniable in 1993, statements of 
protest were issued by the Clinton administration," notes Aird. "Yet 
President Clinton then went on to restore U.S. funding," which the 
Reagan administration had suspended in 1985.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Strong words followed by weak actions sending a contrary signal have 
become the standard response of the Clinton administration to human 
rights offenses in China," observes Aird. Why aren't Americans 
protesting our government's support for China's murderous methods of 
undermining maternity? Aird speculates that "the unsubstantiated but 
widely held belief in a world population crisis has dulled public outrage 
over violations of reproductive freedom in China." He also suggests that 
"business interests intent on seeking profits by investing in China's 
booming economy do not want to risk strained relations with China over 
its human rights violations."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Whatever the reason, the American people have not sufficiently 
publicized their repugnance for these policies, and the indifference of our 
government has been interpreted as a tacit endorsement of Chinese 
methods. "China's rulers apparently now feel free to expand tyrannical 
practices not only in birth control but also in the treatment of political 
dissidents," observes Aird, and we are in part to blame. "Although 
Chinese leaders say publicly that foreign criticism of China's human 
rights record . . . will not be accepted, China has in practice shown itself 
to be extremely sensitive to determined criticism backed by potential 
actions."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Aird argues that the U.S. should "amend our immigration laws to 
recognize persecution under compulsory family planning programs as a 
basis for granting asylum. And we should withhold all funding from the 
United Nations Fund for Population Activities, the International Planned 
Parenthood Federation, and any other organization that provides 
assistance to China's harsh birth control program."

<h2>
MOSHER ON CHINA
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
It's almost too bizarre to be believed, but reports of fetal cannibalism in 
communist China have been confirmed.
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The rumors circulated for months, and the decent Americans who heard 
them fervently hoped that they were fabricated. Then, documentation 
appeared, and reputable religious and conservative publications had no 
choice but to file their disturbing news reports. The mainstream media 
have yet to acknowledge the unpleasant reality, but even they will not be 
able to ignore it forever.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In an interview published in the January issue of the Rutherford Institute's 
monthly journal, the executive director of Human Life International's 
Population Research Institute confirms that aborted fetuses are consumed 
for health purposes in China and blames the communist government in 
Beijing for making this revolting practice possible. With as many as 14 
million abortions performed in China in a single year, "there's an ample 
supply of aborted fetuses," says Steven Mosher. Noting that the Chinese 
government is "an avowedly atheistic one which regards human beings 
only as highly evolved apes," Mosher argues that the utilitarian mindset 
inculcated in the Chinese people by their government is what "gives rise 
to fetal consumption."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Don't say it can't happen here, because it can. American society is also 
infected with utilitarianism, and the symptoms of this morally bankrupt 
philosophy are all around us. Mosher warns that "there's very little going 
on in China that isn't happening to one degree or another in the United 
States." The Chinese perform late-term abortions, and so do we. The 
Chinese forcibly sterilize women of child-bearing age, and the practice of 
tying tubes without asking is not unheard-of in American hospitals. The 
Chinese use "surplus" babies for cruel experiments, and we use fetal 
tissue from "surplus" babies for our own sickening scientific studies.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"In China," observes Mosher, "the use of ultrasound technology to detect 
defects in the unborn child is very common, and many fetuses are aborted 
for the sole reason that they happen to be female. But in the United States 
it's not illegal to abort children for reasons of gender, and it's quite 
common to abort children because a test has revealed a possible 
chromosomal defect."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
China's war on its own children will eventually spread to its elderly. 
Noting that "the population of China is aging more rapidly than any 
human population in the history of the world," as a direct result of its 
coercive birth control program, Mosher predicts that "China's future will 
involve a massive campaign of euthanasia." In fact, the elderly are 
already being denied medical treatment in Chinese hospitals "on the 
ground that treating them is not cost-effective."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mosher warns that China's self-consuming culture represents "one 
possible future of the United States." He notes that "there is a certain 
element of the radical environmentalist movement which believes that the 
population of the United States . . . should be reduced by half." If we 
don't make a convincing case for life, they may get their wish.

<title>Duplantier: Flat Tax -- 4/29/96</title>

<h2>Flat Tax </h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
"Americans are tired of our oppressive tax code and they want a new 
system. But to get there, they need an honest and open debate. They're 
not getting it from the politicians and the media."
</i></blockquote>


<P> 
Having recognized that they could no longer ignore the subject of the 
flat tax, the mainstream media have recently resorted to their second-
favorite tactic: misrepresenting the issue. They claim that the flat 
tax will hurt homeowners by eliminating the deduction for mortgage 
interest. They suggest that the flat tax will send philanthropy into a 
free fall by eliminating the deduction for charitable giving. They say 
that the flat tax isn't even a tax cut -- and, if it is, well, then, 
it's a tax cut that favors the rich! 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 Congressman Dick Armey of Texas thinks it's time to set the record 
straight on the flat tax. The House Majority Leader insists that, no 
matter what the media may say, the flat tax is indeed a tax cut: "With 
a flat tax the middle class will pay less in taxes, their wages will 
increase, and they will keep more of what they earn to save and invest 
in their families." If that's not a tax cut, what is it? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The media attempt to foment class envy, but that doesn't change the 
fact that the flat tax does indeed tax investment income. "What it 
doesn't do," says Armey, "is tax it twice." Businesses will continue 
to pay taxes under a flat tax system. Since corporate income taxes are 
paid, ultimately, by investors, the current tax on investment income 
is actually a second tax on the same income. "Under a flat tax," says 
Armey, "all income, including investment income, is taxed once and 
only once." Why should investors be required, as they are now, to pay 
tax on income that's already been taxed? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The media resort to scare tactics to unnerve the middle-class 
mortgage-holder, but the fact remains that "the flat tax is good for 
homeowners." Armey argues that the flat tax will "lower interest 
rates, reduce mortgage payments, and put more money in the pockets of 
working Americans." Lower rates, lower payments, more money left over 
-- how can that be bad? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The media cynically assume that deductibility drives donations, but 
Armey argues that "the flat tax will not reduce charitable giving. 
Americans don't consult their tax tables and accountants before 
helping their neighbors in need. As our family incomes increase, so 
too will our generosity." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It doesn't matter what the mainstream media say, because the flat tax 
is an idea whose time has come. Congressman Dick Armey maintains that 
the flat tax is "bigger than any politician. It's bigger than any 
political party. And it's bigger than the Washington establishment. It 
belongs to the American people." Armey argues that "class-warfare 
rhetoric" and "narrow, special-interest propaganda" will only delay 
the day of reckoning. "The American people," he says, "deserve an 
open, honest debate on tax reform. Right now."

<h2>Michael New</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
The case of Army Specialist Michael New is a lot more complicated 
than it looks. It involves considerably more than the mere question of 
a soldier disobeying a commanding officer.
</i></blockquote>


<P> 
"The case of Michael New appears simple at first glance," says 
Congressman Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland. "A soldier disobeys a direct 
order and is court-martialed, convicted, and given a bad conduct 
discharge." There's a lot more to it than that, however. "Michael New 
is the first American soldier prosecuted for declining to wear the 
uniform and badge of another government," observes Congressman 
Bartlett. "What is at stake is nothing less than whether we are a 
nation ruled by men, or one ruled by laws."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Bartlett points out that Michael New is a decorated soldier who 
previously served in a United Nations peacekeeping mission. He 
participated in "Operation Southern Watch" in Kuwait in 1993 -- albeit 
"under an American commander wearing his American uniform." Bartlett 
notes that Michael New also agreed to go to Macedonia, as commanded, 
"but questioned his additional orders to wear a United Nations uniform 
including a blue beret and shoulder patch, to rely solely upon a 
United Nations identification card, and to serve under the overall 
command of a foreign officer." New concluded that these orders would 
unlawfully "transfer his allegiance to the United Nations."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As it happens, quite a few of our Congressmen agree with Michael New 
that these orders were illegal. Roscoe Bartlett addresses the issues 
one by one. First, the uniform: "Altering the Army Battle Dress 
Uniform with any foreign badge is prohibited under Army uniform 
regulations." Second, the UN I.D. card: "No American soldier, prior to 
the Macedonia mission, had ever been required to carry and rely upon a 
UN identity card." Third, the question of foreign command: "The 
president as commander-in-chief does not have the authority to deploy 
American soldiers to serve under foreign command."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A number of Congressmen also believe that the mission itself is 
unlawful. The deployment of U.S. troops to Macedonia was "authorized 
and always explicitly defined as a 'Chapter VII' peace enforcement 
operation under the UN Charter," observes Bartlett. "American military 
participation in Chapter VII UN Operations always requires prior 
congressional approval under Section 6 of the United Nations 
Participation Act and under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution." 
Bartlett concludes that "Mr. Clinton's order to deploy American combat 
troops to Macedonia beginning in July 1993 was illegal and 
inconsistent with U.S. statutes and the Constitution."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Roscoe Bartlett believes that "Americans should be grateful for 
Michael New's moral courage to obey his conscience and our 
Constitution." The Congressman has introduced a resolution in the 
House of Representatives called "The American Hero Restoration Act," 
which urges President Clinton to overturn the conviction of Michael 
New and "restore his place of honor in our military." Bartlett says 
it's time to affirm that "American soldiers enlist in our all-
volunteer military to fight for and defend the United States, not the 
United Nations."

<h2>Environmental Phobias</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
What do radon, second-hand smoke, global warming, and the hole in the 
ozone layer all have in common? Just this: The danger they pose has 
been greatly exaggerated in order to justify some unnecessary 
government action.
</i></blockquote>


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"During 1995, scare stories about a future catastrophic greenhouse 
warming gained much momentum, while at the same time the evidence for 
such warming became weaker and weaker," observes Fred Singer of the 
Science and Environmental Policy Project in a recent Washington Times 
editorial. Those scare stories, unfortunately, provide seemingly 
justification for the Global Climate Treaty. The UN-sponsored 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last year approved two 
summary reports that "convey the impression of impending doom and 
provide a spur for hasty and ill-advised action to cut the use of 
energy fuels." The reports created this misleading impression, says 
Singer, by "withholding crucial information (such as that the data 
show a warming rate of zero!)."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Singer points out that 1995 was also the year in which "the production 
of CFCs and other useful chemicals was banned -- in the mistaken 
belief that this policy would avert an epidemic of skin cancer. 
Scientific evidence does not support this hasty action," he says. 
"There is no data to indicate that ultraviolet radiation reaching the 
earth's surface is increasing by even a few percent -- as might be 
expected if the ozone layer were thinning."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In November of last year, the Congressional Research Service released 
a report that reviewed published studies of the effects of "second-
hand" smoke. The report, says Singer, "found no support" for the 
Environmental Protection Agency's 1992 classification of second-hand 
smoke as a "Class A carcinogen" in the workplace. The risk of lung 
cancer posed by second-hand smoke was not statistically significant, 
it turns out, so the EPA simply redefined "statistical significance." 
Singer charges that the EPA "distorted science to establish a 
correlation and suggest a causation that cannot be proven with the 
data at hand."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Also in 1995, evidence was published demonstrating that low levels of 
radioactivity pose no health threat to humans. Ironically, says 
Singer, "the EPA is stirring up more fears just as we learn that 
naturally occurring radon is a very minor risk for lung cancer."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So, is the earth getting warmer? No, but this is the excuse used to 
restrict access to energy. Is the ozone layer developing a hole? No, 
but this mythic menace sufficed to prohibit the production of CFCs. Is 
second-hand smoke a statistically significant carcinogen? No, but 
trumped-up findings to that effect could have led to mandated smoking 
bans in workplaces everywhere. Is radon the "number one environmental 
health hazard"? No, but EPA scare tactics will likely make radon 
mitigation a multi-billion-dollar industry. Fred Singer of the Science 
and Environmental Policy Project points out that "environmental 
regulation is now costing the nation more than $150 billion per year." 
That's a cost we can ill afford, especially for imaginary dangers.

<h2>Government Bureaucracy</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
Few American taxpayers noticed much difference when thousands of 
government workers were declared nonessential and told to stay home 
until the federal budget crisis could be resolved. The only question 
was, how did so many unnecessary employees ever land a civil service 
job in the first place?
</i></blockquote>



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 In a recent editorial in the Washington Times, Gordon Jones of the 
Association of Concerned Taxpayers records the candid observations of 
one federal government employee regarding the low levels of 
productivity among his coworkers. "A large percentage of federal 
workers hurt rather than help get the work done," claims the 
exasperated civil servant, who for obvious reasons prefers to remain 
nameless. (We'll call him J.B., short for Jaundiced Bureaucrat.) J.B. 
complains that the worst one-third of the federal work force "actually 
drains energy and production from the efforts of their colleagues." 
Clearly, it would be better to pay such people to stay home; but, if 
that's the case, why pay them at all?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The worst offenders were probably born that way, but there's something 
about working for the government that devitalizes even the most 
competent and conscientious civil servant. "Most federal workers did 
not start this way," says J.B. "Most walked in the door on their first 
day of federal service with a strong work ethic and an optimistic 
vision of serving their fellow citizens." Eventually, however, "the 
dysfunctional work environment takes its toll. First they lose their 
optimism, and then many lose their work ethic. Why? Because they 
observe many nonproductive troublemakers going undisciplined, and 
hardworking individuals going unrewarded. They learn that the 
personnel policies and processes encourage frivolous grievances and 
insupportable accusations. They learn that, in most cases, it is more 
helpful to your federal career to maintain the status quo."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Where are the managers, the persons responsible for motivating the 
work force and assessing individual performance? They're there, all 
right, but they're not doing their jobs. "The word 'management' is 
often used in the federal service by people who do not seem to 
understand what it means," observes J.B. "Individuals selected for 
their political connections instead of their management ability fill 
critical decision-making positions." Such persons are "guided by a 
perspective that demands a short-term 'fix' rather than a longer-term 
solution." The yes men they surround themselves with are happy to 
validate this self-serving approach.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It may come as a surprise that many of the idlers feeding at the 
public trough in Washington feel themselves strangely put upon. 
Despite all evidence to the contrary, they're convinced that they're 
underpaid, compared to private-sector employees, and overworked. J.B. 
dismisses these complaints. "An amazing number of federal employees," 
he insists, "could not qualify for jobs in the private sector that 
paid anywhere near our current salaries." With 10 weeks' worth of 
vacation, holidays, and sick leave each year -- and precious little 
expected from him when he does show up at the office -- J.B. confesses 
that he is anything but underpaid and overworked.

<h2>College Education</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
The National Association of Scholars has just published a devastating 
report on the dumbing down of 50 top undergraduate colleges and 
universities in America.
</i></blockquote>
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Comparing the years 1914, 1939, 1964, and 1993, the National 
Association of Scholars concludes that students at our country's elite 
institutions of higher learning no longer receive a comprehensive 
liberal-arts education. The universities have simply purged from the 
curriculum many of the required courses that provide the historical, 
cultural, political and scientific basics of our society.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The number of mandatory courses plummeted from an average of 10 in 
1914 to fewer than three in 1993. Students are rarely required now to 
take basic survey courses in key disciplines. Few of today's courses 
require prerequisites, thereby diminishing the cumulative impact of a 
college education. In 1914, universities offered an average of only 23 
courses per institution that did not require a prerequisite course; 
today, the number is 582. Only 12 percent of universities now require 
a thesis or comprehensive examination to get a bachelor's degree. As 
late as 1964, more than half of universities did.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Few colleges teach writing or mathematics any more, a fact that is 
evidenced by the appalling number of graduates who can neither draft a 
coherent memo nor keep a basic ledger. In 1914, nearly all 
universities had required courses in English composition; today, it's 
only 36 percent. In 1914, 82 percent of the universities had 
traditional mathematics requirements; now, only 12 percent do. As late 
as 1964, more than 70 percent of the institutions required at least 
one course in the natural sciences; that figure has now fallen to only 
34 percent. In 1914, 90 percent of our elite colleges required 
history; now only one of the 50 schools has a required history course. 
Literature courses were required at 75 percent of the institutions in 
1914; today, not one of the "best" institutions has a literature 
requirement.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Meanwhile, the total number of courses offered at undergraduate 
institutions has quintupled since 1914. That quantity, unfortunately, 
does not translate into quality. The majority of these additional 
courses feature arcane subjects of interest, and profit, only to the 
dilettantes who offer them. Many courses don't even offer college-
level material, but seek instead to remedy the many deficiencies of 
the average high school education. Sometimes these courses are called 
"remedial," but the institutions prefer euphemisms such as "second 
tier" and "sub-freshman." Unheard of prior to 1939, today such make-up 
courses are offered in 70 percent of the elite universities, and most 
of them award college credit.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Association of Scholars concludes that our best colleges 
and universities now turn out graduates who are painfully ignorant of 
western civilization and heritage. They do not learn the highlights of 
our history, they do not understand the implications of our political 
and economic systems, and they cannot appreciate our literary and 
artistic legacies. Because our colleges have failed us, we now risk 
losing the common bond that unites us as Americans.

<h2>Free Trade</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
Absolute free trade between countries does not exist. With the 
possible exception of the United States, all manage their trade to 
serve their own national interests.
</i></blockquote>
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sovereign countries should establish trade policies that serve their 
own best interests, and they should expect their trading partners to 
do likewise. So-called free trade really makes no sense. Fair trade, 
however, is something different. All countries should be held to a 
certain minimal standard in their trade practices, and those that fail 
to live up to such a standard should be penalized. Many of the foreign 
countries that trade with America routinely resort to unfair 
practices, such as devaluing their currency, nationalizing U.S. 
property, violating agreements, stealing our patents and copyrights, 
and counterfeiting our money. It is absurd to advocate "free trade" 
with countries that engage in such disreputable practices.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Free trade" was the slogan used to persuade Congress to pass NAFTA 
and GATT, but what these treaties have done is put U.S. trade under 
the control of powerful new international bureaucracies. GATT created 
the World Trade Organization, which has a legislature, an executive 
branch, and a judicial system to control global trade. GATT is also 
loaded with 22,000 pages of special-interest provisions. What kind of 
"free trade" is it that provides for U.S. taxpayer subsidies of 
foreign industries and governments?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When it comes right down to it, the NAFTA and GATT gang are really 
protectionists. They use the power of government to protect their 
friends. They could care less about protecting American workers, but 
they didn't hesitate to use U.S. taxpayer dollars to protect New York 
investment banks from the consequences of their bad investments in 
Mexico. The GATT treaty was filled with hidden handouts and 
perquisites for the politically powerful, who trumpeted their support 
for "free trade" without publicizing the potential for profit that 
motivated them.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
America's Founding Fathers were all avowed protectionists. To a man, 
they believed that protection of American workers and industries from 
cheap foreign imports is essential to our prosperity, our 
independence, and our sovereignty. The first act passed by our first 
Congress established tariffs on foreign goods -- an essential rite of 
passage in the transformation of our country from dependent colony to 
sovereign nation. Unfortunately, for the last 25 years, U.S. trade 
policy has been dominated by giant corporations that want to take 
advantage of cheap foreign labor and still have open access to 
American markets. Congressmen and executive branch officials 
accommodate these interests with the expectation of future employment 
or other consideration from the companies they favor at the expense of 
their countrymen.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More and more economists are beginning to recognize that "free trade" 
will bring about the total destruction of the balance between capital 
and labor, allowing capital to squeeze labor costs lower and lower. 
This will drive prices lower too, of course, but lower prices will not 
provide much solace to consumers in the long run, because consumers 
are also workers, and workers without jobs cannot take advantage of 
lower prices.

<h2>MSAs</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
 A march to protest the inequities of managed health care is planned 
for our nation's capital this month. Opposition to the tactics of 
health maintenance organizations is bubbling over.
</i></blockquote>

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Health maintenance organizations (known as HMOs) suffer from a built-
in conflict of interest; the gatekeepers and the CEOs make more money 
when they deny their policyholders the right to see a specialist. 
Congressional Republicans have a good answer to the problem, however -
- one that would put extra money in the pockets of workers whose real 
wages have declined, and ease the strain of downsizing by allowing 
them to take some of their benefits with them when they leave a 
company.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The solution is Medical Savings Accounts (known as MSAs), which most 
House Republicans campaigned on in 1994. Congress passed Rep. Bill 
Archer's excellent MSA bill in the Balanced Budget Act, but Clinton 
vetoed the measure. Then the House passed it again in its health care 
reform bill, which is now pending. But President Clinton and the 
Washington press corps are trying to bamboozle the Dole-Gingrich 
Congress into passing the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill without MSAs, in an 
effort to resurrect the Hillary health-care plan resoundingly rejected 
in 1994.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Medical Savings Accounts are the best solution to all the problems 
connected with health care: the high cost, the choice of doctors, 
portability, pre-existing conditions, job lock, uninsured Americans, 
gatekeepers, capitation, deductibles, co-payments, paperwork, long-
term care, the looming insolvency of Medicare, and even the decline in 
real wages. Here is how MSAs work: An employer buys his employee a 
high-deductible policy and pre-pays the deductible (up to $2,000 per 
year for singles and $4,000 for families) by putting it each year into 
an individual Medical Savings Account. The employee can use this ready 
cash to visit the doctors, hospitals, and clinics of his choice, and 
the high-deductible policy covers any additional expenses. The 
employee owns his own MSA, and can take it with him when changing 
jobs, thus solving the problems of portability, pre-existing 
conditions, and job lock. MSA funds are available for many medical 
expenses often not covered by company plans or by Medicare. Best of 
all, any MSA funds that an employee does not spend will accumulate in 
his own tax-free, interest-bearing savings account. MSAs thus restore 
consumer discipline to the medical marketplace, providing incentives 
to save.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Archer bill would give MSAs pretty much the same tax-deductibility 
that is now enjoyed exclusively by company-paid plans. Our present 
system unfairly grants tax-deductibility only to plans owned by 
employers, but not to plans that allow individual employees to own 
their own health insurance, control their own health care spending, or 
set up their own plan. The officers of big corporations enjoy gold-
plated health insurance paid for with tax-deductible dollars, but the 
self-employed must buy health insurance with after-tax income. It's 
time for Congress to give us the solution to all these problems: 
Medical Savings Accounts.

<h2>Affirmative Action</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
More and more minority members are voicing their opposition to 
affirmative action, rejecting the patronizing racial preferences that 
are supposed to benefit them in college admissions and business 
employment.
</i></blockquote>
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In February, an initiative prohibiting preferential treatment on the 
state and local level qualified for the November ballot in California. 
In March, a federal appeals court rejected the use of racial 
preferences in determining admissions to the University of Texas law 
school. Even as we speak, legislation is pending in Congress that 
would prohibit the use of racial preferences in the hiring of federal 
employees and the awarding of federal contracts. What's going on in 
the state legislatures, the federal courts, and the Congress?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What's happening is that minority members themselves are becoming 
increasingly vocal in their opposition to racial preferences, 
recognizing these condescending concessions as the ultimate form of 
racial prejudice -- and rejecting the pandering posture of the self-
appointed minority leaders who promote them. With this groundswell of 
opposition among the supposed beneficiaries of racial preferences, it 
has now become politically feasible to denounce the injustice of 
affirmative action.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Terry Eastland is the author of a new book called<i> Ending Affirmative 
Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice.</i> In a recent editorial in the 
Wall Street Journal, Eastland observes that racial preferences "have 
never enjoyed majority support and are now in serious political 
trouble." For one thing, there's simply no denying that racial 
preferences are discriminatory. "Whatever might be said in support of 
preferences, they necessarily discriminate against those who lack the 
'right' race or sex. There is no getting around this fact," says 
Eastland, noting that the white female plaintiff denied admission to 
the University of Texas law school "had academic credentials superior 
to most of the black and Mexican-American students admitted under an 
affirmative action plan."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While encouraging what is called "reverse discrimination," preferences 
rarely provide any substantial remedy for actual discrimination 
against minorities. "Because preferences are often a response to 
presumed discrimination on the part of a company, a government, or 
society generally, they move the focus away from the real instances of 
discrimination," says Eastland. Not only that, but they tend to 
benefit the most gifted minority members, leaving the truly 
disadvantaged in some ways worse off than before.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Affirmative action has halted, and in fact reversed, progress toward 
the color-blind society that civil rights activists once claimed as 
their goal. "Preferences have made it harder to overcome the tendency 
. . . of judging people in terms of their racial and ethnic groups," 
says Eastland. The irrationality and injustice of affirmative action 
is apparent to any thinking person, and that is why "substantial 
numbers (sometimes large majorities) of those typically eligible for 
preferential treatment -- African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asian 
Americans -- tell pollsters they are opposed to preferences." Eastland 
concludes that "only law that neither advantages nor disadvantages on 
account of race or ethnicity is law that can equally protect everyone 
in our increasingly diverse nation."

<h2>Privatizing Prisons</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
Privately run correctional facilities are cheaper, and better 
managed, than public prisons. There's only one reason there aren't 
more of them in America: politics.
</i></blockquote>

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Privately owned or operated prisons "are widespread throughout the 
United States," observes Steven Loux, a policy analyst for the 
Pennsylvania House of Representatives. In a report published by the 
Key State's Commonwealth Foundation, Loux presents evidence showing 
that "such private facilities are advantageous to governments because 
they save a great deal of money, perhaps more than 10 percent per year 
in operating costs as compared to equivalent public facilities." Not 
only that, but "private prisons meet, if not surpass, the quality of 
services for prisoners and the protection to the general public 
provided by public prisons."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Loux argues that "government is simply not capable of delivering, 
running, and regulating services either as efficiently or as 
effectively as are private firms." For one thing, government does not 
have the benefit of the price system to help guide its decisions. 
Conversely, the private sector is not subject to the political 
considerations that often militate against cost-effective decisions in 
state bureaucracies. "Since political actors do not suffer economic 
pain from operating inefficient businesses, unlike private actors, the 
temptation to substitute the goals of politically influential players 
for cost-effectiveness is overwhelming," says Loux. "The authorities, 
the executive and the legislature, use their monopoly power over the 
delivery of prison services to assist certain ends -- those of 
politicians, bureaucrats, and prison employees."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even though government itself does not respond automatically to profit 
considerations, it can take advantage of the profit-orientation of 
private-sector suppliers. "Profit can be used to discipline private 
firms in ways that it cannot discipline public bureaucracies," says 
Loux. "In fact, market competition can push private firms to not only 
meet government guidelines, but even exceed them." Such are the 
wonders of renewable contracts. "State bureaucracies cannot be fired," 
Loux laments, "but private firms that contract with the state can."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The reason that private prisons are more economical to operate than 
public facilities is not because they pay their employees less. In 
fact, the evidence indicates that "private prison firms generally do 
offer equivalent salaries and benefits for individual employees." Loux 
cites "significantly different benefit programs" and "lower absentee 
rates among private employees" as two of the cost advantages of 
private prisons. "Economies of scale," he adds, "can play a role in 
reducing the cost of private prisons. Private firms can purchase in 
bulk for their entire operation, and can do so with less bureaucratic 
involvement in comparison to public agencies."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are other reasons, as well. Loux notes that "government 
agencies, in their desire to maintain their level of functioning in 
the upcoming year, want to prevent any decrease in their funding. 
Consequently, any surplus funding at the end of the year must be spent 
in some way." Also, "private firms, because they can be terminated and 
because they face competition, have the incentive to cater their 
operations to government cost standards."

<h2>Education Reform</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
During the recent government shutdown, the Department of Education 
determined that 89 percent of its workforce was "nonessential. " Why, 
then, are 4500 extra bureaucrats receiving $240 million a year in 
salaries?
</i></blockquote>



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Principles of federalism embodied in the Constitution of the United 
States entrust authority over issues of educational policy to the 
States and the people, and a Federal Department of Education is 
inconsistent with such principles," claim the sponsors of the "Back to 
Basics Education Reform Act" now being considered by Congress. 
"Tradition and experience dictate that the governance and management 
of schools in the United States are best performed by parents, 
teachers, and communities. The intrusion by the Department of 
Education into education policy has not benefited the quality of 
education in this nation."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The reform bill's numerous sponsors claim that the Department of 
Education has "weakened the ability of parents to make essential 
decisions about their children's education and has undermined the 
capacity of communities to govern their schools. In the 15 years of 
its existence," they report, "the Department of Education has grown 
from 130 programs and a budget of $14 billion to over 240 separately 
authorized programs which cost almost $32 billion annually. Meanwhile, 
education performance has stagnated or deteriorated."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The reformers in Congress argue that the Department of Education has 
"fostered overregulation, standardization, bureaucratization, and 
litigation in United States education. The Department of Education 
spends large amounts of money on its own maintenance and overhead. As 
an organization, it is inefficient, ill-managed, and wasteful." What's 
the solution? "Only through initiatives led by parents and local 
communities with the power to act can the United States elevate 
educational performance toward an acceptable level. The Department of 
Education," the Congressmen observe, "has been hostile to many 
promising reform ideas."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The stated purpose of the Back to Basics Education Reform Act is four-
fold: "to improve the quality of elementary and secondary and higher 
education programs in the nation; to return the responsibility and 
authority for education to parents, teachers, communities, students, 
and States, and provide them greater control over education spending; 
to ensure that the Federal Government does not overregulate and 
interfere in the decision-making of parents, local communities, 
teachers, and students regarding education; and to ensure that 
Americans are able to compete in the global economy of the 21st 
century."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Back to Basics Education Reform Act would repeal Goals 2000, the 
School-to-Work Opportunities Act, and the National Education 
Statistics Act. It would also abolish the Department of Education. In 
addition, the bill recommends "a review and evaluation as to the 
feasibility of further enhancing the ability of States and local 
communities to fund education by reducing the Federal tax burden and 
commensurately eliminating Federal Government involvement in providing 
grants for education programs." Isn't it time we put an end to Uncle 
Sam's unconstitutional meddling in education -- and give those 4500 
nonessential education bureaucrats a chance to do something productive 
with their lives?

 <h2> MOTHERHOOD II</h2>
<P>
<blockquote><I>

 
Early in December of 1947, Dr. J.A. MacDougall promised a young  
woman dying of tuberculosis that, if she lived long enough, he'd let her  
leave the hospital for a few hours to celebrate Christmas at home with  
her family. </I></blockquote>
 
The numerous medical procedures the doctors had tried in an effort to  
seal the tubercular cavity in the lower lobe of this 23-year-old woman's  
right lung had failed. "Amazingly, she was still alive on Christmas Eve,  
but just barely," Dr. MacDougall recalled, so he kept his promise to let  
her spend Christmas Day at home with her husband and their only child.  
She was grateful for that brief respite, but continued to decline. By the  
end of February, she was down to 80 pounds, and "new complications  
developed. She became nauseous -- even without food in her stomach." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Dr. MacDougall dismissed as "ridiculous" a colleague's suggestion that  
his patient might be pregnant. "Everything I knew about medicine added  
up to one conclusion: she was so ill, so weak, that she couldn't possibly  
have conceived. Her body wasn't up to it. Nevertheless, I ordered a  
pregnancy test. To my astonishment, it was positive." The doctor and his  
colleagues were confronted with a moral dilemma. "Legally, medically,  
we could have taken the child through abortion; it imperiled a life that  
was already in jeopardy. But we didn't do it," Dr. MacDougall confided.  
The doctors shared the woman's religious objections, but they also were  
convinced that "the operation would kill her [and that] her body would  
reject the child anyway." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Somehow, the woman clung to life -- her own and that of her unborn  
child. "And in late June, 1948, an incredible thing happened," said Dr.  
MacDougall. "She began to eat, and to gain weight. A chest X-ray  
showed that the growth of the TB cavity had stopped. Not long after,  
another X-ray showed why: the diaphragm was pushing up against the  
lower lobe of her diseased lung to make room for the child she was  
bearing. Nature was doing exactly what we'd failed to do: it was pressing  
the sides of that deadly hole together. The child was saving the mother." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

What prompted Dr. MacDougall to recount the details of this amazing  
incident forty years after it occurred? "I'm concerned about the  
liberalization of abortion laws and the growing clamor for even greater  
liberalization," he explained. "I'm against it on medical grounds: a  
doctor doesn't exist to take life, but to save it. I'm against it on religious  
grounds: I believe that human life is sacred, that only He who creates life  
has the right to take it away. I'm against it, finally, because of the case  
I've described. The child didn't destroy the mother. It saved her. Call it  
the will of God; call it human love; call it the mystical quality of  
motherhood, the turning in upon herself to fight still more because she  
had still more to fight for; call it what you will. It happened." 
 <BR>

<h2> LAW OF THE SEA TREATY</h2>   
<P>
<blockquote><I>
   
The Clinton administration is trying to persuade the United States    
Senate to ratify a United Nations Treaty that Ronald Reagan refused to    
sign, with good reason, fourteen years ago!</I>   
</blockquote>

   
Despite abundant resources, America nevertheless lacks certain essential    
minerals, such as cobalt, bauxite, chromium, manganese, and platinum.    
Cobalt is essential for jet engines, magnetic materials for electronics,    
metal cutting, and mineral tools. Bauxite is essential to aluminum, and is    
also important to refractories, chemicals, packaging, mechanical    
equipment, and abrasives. Chromium is essential to metallurgical,    
refractory, and chemical industries. Manganese is essential to steel, pig    
iron, dry cell batteries, and various chemical processes. Platinum-group    
metals are essential to automobiles, chemical processing, the electrical    
industry, and petroleum refining.
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
   
We import most of our manganese from Russia and South Africa. Yet,    
the ocean floor extending from our West Coast to Hawaii is rich in    
deposits of this mineral. U.S. security interests may depend on our access    
to such vital resources at the bottom of the sea, but the financial    
investment required to bring them to the surface is tremendous, because    
the minerals are scattered on the ocean floor at depths of as much as    
20,000 feet. Nevertheless, American mining concerns have the capital    
and the technology to take on this challenge, if they can be assured of    
realizing a profit in the venture.
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
   
The Law of the Sea Treaty, currently being pushed by the Clinton    
administration, would give Third World nations control over the    
development and use of the deep seabed mineral resources now being    
mined by American firms. The Treaty's international controls and    
regulations would hamper the efforts of U.S. ocean-mining companies to    
continue harvesting strategic ocean minerals essential to our industry    
and to our military defense.
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
   
The Law of the Sea Treaty would surrender major political and strategic    
advantages to Russia, which is self-sufficient in the minerals that    
America extracts from the ocean floor. The Treaty would deny U.S.    
ownership of ocean minerals, while forcing American companies to use    
their technology and capital to mine these minerals for the benefit of    
unfriendly, anti-American countries.
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
   
The Law of the Sea Treaty would establish an International Seabed    
Authority, which would set both general production controls and specific    
production limits for ocean mining sites. Any American corporation    
intent on making the tremendous investment involved in mining the    
ocean floor would first have to seek approval from the Executive Council    
of the International Seabed Authority. If its request is approved, the    
American corporation would begin operations with the understanding    
that one-half of the approved mining tract will be set aside so that an    
international mining operation (set up by the Seabed Authority) can use    
the American company's geological data, technology, and money to    
compete against it!
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
   
The United Nations Law of the Sea Treaty threatens the sovereignty and    
security of our nation. It also jeopardizes the legitimate financial    
interests of U.S. businesses and the health of our country's economy. Any    
American politician who supports this treaty has some explaining to do.

<h2>Moscow Bound</h2>


<i><blockquote>


 
With over 1000 pages, including notes and index, Moscow Bound, by  
Vietnam veteran John M.G. Brown, is the most thoroughly documented  
and comprehensive book ever written about American soldiers who  
disappeared in Soviet captivity from 1918 onward. It's not available in  
bookstores, however, we offer the following excerpt. 
 </blockquote></i>
<P>
"American and Allied war prisoners of 1918-1920 were treated [by the  
Soviets] as potential political assets to be exploited for use in a  
worldwide propaganda war. For the first time, the United States was  
confronted with an ideological enemy that held certain American  
prisoners of war secretly, to gain the use of their minds in understanding  
the enemies of Bolshevism, and which also held other U.S. prisoners of  
war and civilians openly, for use as hostages to gain diplomatic  
concessions and ransom. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"The official American response to this situation in 1919 was to 'classify'  
all information about the existence of such prisoners of war, or missing  
men suspected of being held prisoner, as a state secret. The public was  
not allowed to know this fact, which resulted in many misconceptions  
about Soviet methods and intentions. Admission of their existence would  
have revealed the impossibility of recovering the prisoners without  
resorting to another major war, less than a year after the 1918  
Armistice.... 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"At the end of World War II, as the Red Army overran eastern Europe,  
hundreds of thousands of western Allied and American prisoners of war  
and interned civilians were liberated by the Soviets, but many thousands  
disappeared while under Russian control. Faced once again with  
impossible Soviet demands for diplomatic concessions, financial aid and  
other conditions for the release of prisoners they publicly denied holding,  
President Harry Truman chose once again to avoid a military  
confrontation so soon after the Second World War. The entire body of  
information concerning U.S. POWs and MIAs, who had been in eastern  
European German POW camps when the Soviets took control, was again  
'classified' in the name of national security, and remained secret for more  
than four decades to come. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"The emboldened Soviets, under dictator Josef Stalin and his successors,  
thenceforth kidnapped American military and civilian personnel,  
including aircrews from U.S. Cold War reconnaissance missions, almost  
with impunity, secure in the knowledge that an unspoken 'wink and nod  
diplomacy' existed between the superpowers: that prisoners thus captured  
would remain secret, and unless publicly acknowledged, were 'gone  
forever.' The results of the Korean War further indicated the United  
States was willing to abandon U.S. prisoners of war known to have been  
alive in Soviet, Chinese and North Korean control, rather than submit to  
blackmail demands that would establish a precedent that the United  
States was willing to 'trade in human lives.' President Dwight D.  
Eisenhower, the former U.S. commander in Europe during World War  
II, this time made the decision that the families of POWs and MIAs held  
in China and Russia should not be informed about the fate of their loved  
ones, since it was then believed that the KGB would never release  
them...." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<h2>Media Violence</h2>


<i><blockquote>


A new report from Focus on the Family charges that the content of our  
popular media is becoming increasingly violent.
 </blockquote></i>

<P>

"Three decades ago, not one popular song encouraged robbery, rape,  
murder, assaults, or using weapons to settle disputes," says Focus on the  
Family research manager Robert Waliszewski. "In today's popular music,  
all these themes can be found -- and worse! Nothing is taboo.  
Unfortunately, America's streets and neighborhoods increasingly reflect  
this fact. What's more, since violent lyrics are a relatively new  
phenomenon, no one knows the results of raising a generation on this  
type of musical diet. In addition, teenagers have greater access to (and  
are listening to) far more music than they have in past generations." By  
the end of high school, the average teenager has listened to more than  
10,000 hours of rock music. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Waliszewski argues that "television's preoccupation with sex, violence,  
and sexualized violence would have been unthinkable in the minds of its  
early pioneers." But ugliness and depravity are pervasive on television  
today, and "TV talk shows are just the tip of the iceberg." Waliszewski  
warns that "television transmits values that are opposite to those being  
taught at home," forcing children "to choose which message to believe."  
Alarming increases in juvenile delinquency rates would seem to suggest  
that television is winning the values battle. "TV receives the lion's share  
of a young person's attention -- and does so in their most impressionable  
years," says Waliszewski. "By the time the average American child  
graduates high school, he or she will have spent nearly 20,000 hours in  
front of a television" -- twice the amount of time spent in school. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Much of the trash on television is recycled garbage from Hollywood.  
Waliszewski notes that films like "Natural Born Killers" and "Menace II  
Society" have encouraged impressionable viewers to imitate the  
unspeakable violence they glorified. But the ill effects don't end there.  
"For many undetermined others, their values were molded -- causing a  
desensitization toward violence and a loss of respect for society's laws  
and lawkeepers." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Jerry Melchisedeck of Focus on the Family cites research identifying "a  
short-term relationship between playing violent video games and  
increased aggressive behavior in younger children." The data suggest  
that "the ill effects of video games are worse than those of TV because  
children actively control the violence rather than passively view it. In

The ability to "download" video games is one of the major appeals of the  
so-called Information Superhighway. Thirty million people worldwide  
are now hooked up to the Internet, and video games aren't the only  
noneducational diversion available to them. Pornographers and  
pedophiles are already exploiting the perverse possibilities of electronic  
mail. Waliszewski and Melchisedeck of Focus on the Family warn that  
"parents must not look to the government to protect their children. They  
must take an active role in monitoring" the content of the various  
popular media available in their own homes.

<h2>Corporate Giving</h2>


<i><blockquote>



You'd think that Big Business interests would support our free   
enterprise system and our constitutional form of government, but they   
don't. In fact, the bulk of their annual corporate giving goes to nonprofit   
groups that promote increased regulation and higher taxes.  

   </blockquote></i>

<P>

An expert on corporate philanthropy claims that "corporate America is   
funding its enemies." Austin Fulk of the Capital Research Center reports   
that "many corporations give away their investors' dollars to special   
interest advocacy groups that favor irresponsible government policies   
harmful to a corporation's own best interests." In a recent issue of   
Human Events, Fulk charges that "big business is undermining   
American values by freely contributing to tax-exempt groups that work   
against a free and competitive market." He points out that "tax-exempt   
groups receiving the biggest share of corporate charitable dollars   
repeatedly offer status quo proposals to solve America's most pressing   
problems: racial quotas, increased welfare and entitlement programs,   
higher taxes and more government spending, command-and-control   
environmental laws, and regulations on employers."  
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


More than 300 nonprofit advocacy groups received contributions from   
America's top 250 corporations in 1993, but only 35 of those groups   
received more than $250,000 apiece. Austin Fulk reports that nearly two-  
thirds of these 35 groups "favor the liberal, tried-and-failed policies of   
bureaucratic government. Groups such as the Nature Conservancy, the   
NAACP, the Center for Community Change, and Planned Parenthood   
get big corporate grants."  
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Liberal groups with a Big-Government bias aren't the only beneficiaries   
of corporate largesse, however. "Corporations not only fund groups   
working against the general interests of business, but some also support   
radical activist groups that are principled opponents of America's   
enterprise tradition," says Fulk. "Corporate funding, even in small   
amounts, affects the fortunes of radical activists far out of proportion to   
the actual dollar amount. A corporate gift lends respectability to radical   
groups. It gives them a credential so that they can ask other corporations,   
individuals, and grantmaking foundations for funding."  
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Donations to nonprofit groups that promote big government also   
undermine the work of legitimate charities. "Private charities have a   
record of effectively delivering services," says Fulk. "But too often their   
work is overshadowed by failed government programs that perpetuate the   
social problems they were supposed to address. The mission of charity is   
hurt when government programs replace private programs, and when   
taxpayer funding replaces private contributions and individual   
voluntarism."  
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Austin Fulk of the Capital Research Center urges American investors to   
hold corporate management responsible for foolish and self-defeating   
philanthropy. If managers can't make charitable contributions wisely,   
they should make none at all. "Corporate managements do shareholders   
and the nation a grave disservice when they fund leftist advocacy   
groups," says Fulk. "If the welfare state is to be replaced by an   
opportunity society, support for nonprofit institutions must become more   
discerning. Individuals as well as corporations must champion charities   
and advocacy groups that encourage self-reliance. And they must refuse   
support to nonprofit groups that draw strength from government."

<h2>Holding Criminals Responsible</h2>
<blockquote><i>

Noted criminologists say it's time to quit finding excuses for the   
behavior of criminals and start holding them responsible for their   
actions.  </i></blockquote><P>
  
The criminal shares certain personality traits in common with the   
psychopath, says Robert James Bidinotto, editor of a book called   
"Criminal Justice: The Legal System vs. Individual Responsibility."   
Those common characteristics include: "a short-range, self-indulgent   
outlook on life; a lack of any sense of self-responsibility; the desire to   
manipulate and dominate others through chronic deception and force;   
and the ability to shut off his conscience at will." Treating a person who   
exhibits those traits as though he were a responsible citizen is a grave   
error, and yet, that's exactly what our criminal justice system does.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Whether that assumption is warranted in a particular 
Bidinotto asserts that the criminal justice system has been captured by   
"intellectuals in the social science establishment," who have convinced   
themselves -- without any evidence whatsoever -- that the criminal is not   
responsible for his own actions, but that society is somehow to blame.   
This "Excuse-Making Industry," as Bidinotto calls it, has recklessly   
abandoned the punishment of criminals in favor of a fervently hoped-for,   
but ever-illusive rehabilitation. Needless to say, this change in policy has   
found favor with the self-indulgent, irresponsible, manipulative, and   
remorseless personalities who make up the criminal element.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"For the last quarter-century, a network of anti-incarceration, pro-  
prisoner analysts, activists, lawyers, lobbyists, journalists, and judges has   
perpetuated a number of false ideas about crime and punishment in the   
United States," say criminologists Charles Logan and John DiIulio, two   
of the authors featured in the book "Criminal Justice." Logan and DiIulio   
argue that "the consequences of these false ideas have been quite tragic   
indeed," making it easier for criminals to indulge in crime, and   
concentrating crime "in economically distressed inner-city   
neighborhoods, inviting the criminal predators of these areas to   
repeatedly victimize their struggling underclass neighbors."  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"When a person commits a particularly sordid crime, his sanity may be   
questioned," but even the most violent criminal "is rational, calculating,   
and deliberate in his actions," observes clinical psychologist Stanton   
Samenow, in another chapter of the book "Criminal Justice." "Criminals   
know right from wrong," Samenow insists. "In fact, some know the laws   
better than their lawyers. But they believe that whatever they want to do   
at any given time is right for them. Their crimes require logic and self-  
control."  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Criminals are not "mentally ill," nor should they be excused as "victims   
of poverty, broken homes, racism, and a society that denies them   
opportunities," says Samenow. "Sociological explanations for crime,   
plausible as they may seem, are simplistic. If they were correct, we'd   
have far more criminals than we do. Criminals come from all kinds of   
families and neighborhoods. Most poor people are law-abiding, and most   
kids from broken homes are not delinquents. Children may bear the scars   
of neglect and deprivation for life, but most do not become criminals."

 May 22, 1996<br></i> 
 <h2>
 SLAVE-LABOR GOODS 
 </h2><blockquote></i><P><I>
Legislators in California and Massachusetts are considering bills to  
prohibit their state governments from buying slave-labor goods. 
 </i></blockquote><P>
Legislation proposed in California requires that all state contracts "shall  
contain a statement in which the contractor attests that no foreign-made  
equipment, materials, or supplies furnished to the state pursuant to the  
contract have been produced in whole or in part by forced labor, convict  
labor, or indentured labor under penal sanction." Legislation proposed in  
Massachusetts would likewise require state contractors to "swear under  
penalty of perjury" that their goods have not been produced by forced  
labor. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Carl Olsen of State Department Watch, a nonpartisan foreign policy  
watchdog group, suggests that these proposed bills have been "prompted  
by the Federal government's indifference about slave labor overseas and  
its threat to American workers and firms." While acknowledging that  
"the importation of slave-made goods is banned by federal statute,"  
Olsen argues that "the ban has been easily circumvented by cumbersome  
Customs Service regulations and uncooperative foreign governments.  
The Chinese government," he points out, "has not allowed any  
inspection of its laogai facilities in over a year even though the Customs  
Service has demanded to see numerous ones." Olsen reports that "the  
largest forced labor systems in the world are in China and the former  
Soviet Union. The Chinese laogai factories and farms hold 20 million  
workers, equal in number to the entire workforce of California. Many  
gulags in the former Soviet Union are still in operation." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Neither the Clinton administration nor Congress has shown much  
concern with "slave labor overseas and its unfair economic threat to  
American workers and firms," says Olsen. At a February 29th World  
Affairs Council luncheon in Los Angeles, then-U.S. Trade  
Representative Mickey Kantor "stated that forced labor was not an issue  
in his bilateral negotiations with China. " Olsen notes that Most Favored  
Nation tariff status "was granted to China in 1994 with no human rights  
reservations as in years before," and he predicts that such reservations  
will again fall by the wayside when China's Most Favored Nation status  
comes up for renewal in June. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Carl Olsen of State Department Watch says that the State Department's  
1992 Memorandum of Understanding with China regarding the  
inspection of suspected slave-labor facilities "has been ignored by the  
Chinese government without any consequence. The State Department,"  
he adds, "has no regulation to avoid purchasing slave-made goods for its  
own use or for foreign aid programs. It does not intend to insist on anti- 
slave labor policies for multinational organizations such as the United  
Nations and the Organization of American States." Olsen also points out  
that "no agency in the federal government has any contract provision,  
regulation, or monitoring program to prevent the purchase of slave-made  
goods or services. For the billions of dollars of purchases overseas for use  
overseas by the Federal government, there is absolutely no prohibition  
under current law against purchasing and using slave-made goods since  
the goods are not imported into the U.S."

<h2>RITALIN</h2>
<P>
<blockquote><I>
  
  
The Chuck E Cheese pizza chain bills itself as the place "where a kid   
can be a kid. " Elementary school used to be such a place, but not   
anymore. Nowadays, when a kid acts like a kid, the public schools   
diagnose him as having an attention deficit or hyperactivity disorder.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
  
Remember, when you were a kid, how you never ran out of energy? How   
you could never sit still for more than a few minutes at a time? How your   
mind would race from one subject to the next? How you loved to   
daydream? You had no idea you were suffering from a disease, did you?
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
  
As many as two million children have been diagnosed as having   
Attention Deficit Disorder or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.   
The preferred form of treatment for these alleged disorders is a powerful   
drug called Ritalin -- a Schedule II controlled substance, as are cocaine   
and methadone. The U.S. Department of Education formally recognized   
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder as a handicap in 1991 and made   
federal funds available for local school districts to provide special   
educational and psychological services for children afflicted with the   
normal characteristics of childhood. 
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
  
Needless to say, many school systems liked having extra cash to play   
with, and were perfectly willing to add special physical and mental   
health programs to their ever-growing menu of services if that was what   
would keep the funds flowing from Washington. Goals 2000 has   
provided a convenient umbrella for new programs in which school health   
officials test children for emotional, social, mental, and physical   
disorders -- and, when they deem it necessary, prescribe and administer   
medications such as Ritalin, Valium, and Prozac. New rules allow nurse   
practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe drugs. Goals 2000   
proposals receive funding from the Department of Education, Medicaid,   
Maternal and Child Health block grants, state programs, and private   
foundations. 
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160; 
  
In 1994, the U.S. Department of Education gave the Chesapeake   
Institute of Washington, D.C. the funding to produce two videos called   
Facing the Challenges of Attention Deficit Disorder and One Child in   
Every Classroom. The completed videos included enthusiastic   
endorsements of Ritalin from parents whose children take the drug. A   
PBS documentary subsequently revealed, however, that these same   
parents were board members of a group called Children and Adults with   
Attention Deficit Disorder, which has received cash grants of $900,000   
plus in-kind services from the manufacturer of Ritalin. John Merrow,   
executive producer of the PBS documentary, reported that Ritalin is now   
so plentiful that a black market has developed on the school playground.   
At many junior high schools, Ritalin is the first drug a child experiments   
with. 
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
  
It's bad enough that the public schools have intentionally dumbed down   
their curricula in order to turn our children into intellectual zombies.   
Now they're pinpointing the kids with energy and spunk and drugging   
them into a state of lethargy. Parents of a child who has been diagnosed   
by school personnel as having Attention Deficit Disorder or Attention   
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder should seek a second opinion.

<h2>"CAREERS" BILL</h2>
<P>
<blockquote><I>  
  
Americans are lucky to live in a society in which education is available   
to all and the individual is free to choose what he will make of himself.   
In totalitarian countries, the State determines who will get the benefit of   
education and what job opportunities a person will have.</BLOCKQUOTE></I>
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
  
There is no clamor in the heartland for radical restrictions on the   
freedom Americans enjoy to improve their minds and plot the course of   
their careers. There is no grassroots support for turning our public   
schools into vocational training centers for a docile national workforce.   
How, then, to explain the progress of the CAREERS bill and the   
Workforce Development Act?
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
  
Under these bipartisan education bills now moving through Congress,   
the Federal Government would collect taxes, issue educational   
regulations, and then pass the proceeds and the power to State   
Governors, circumventing their legislatures altogether. This massive   
legislation would restructure public schools throughout America,   
building on the Goals 2000 and School-to-Work Acts passed in 1994.   
H.R.1617 (known as the CAREERS bill) passed the House last   
September by a vote of 345 to 79, and its companion S. 143 (called the   
Workforce Development Act) passed the Senate in October by 95 to 2. 
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
  
More than 60 Republican members of the Missouri House of   
Representatives recently fired off a letter to House Speaker Newt   
Gingrich, objecting to the fact that H.R. 1617 "centralizes unprecedented   
powers at the federal level" and "supersedes state laws and further takes   
us, the local elected officials of the people of this state, out of the process   
of education." Noting that the CAREERS act "amends out the state   
legislature, replacing it with the Governor," the State Representatives   
assert that "this practice of avoiding the Legislature is unacceptable and   
flies in the face of the principle of local control of education." 
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
  
The Missouri Republicans also charge that unelected bureaucrats are   
attempting to grab power over school curricula though a grant   
application process. The grant applications that Governors now submit   
in a bid for federal funds bind the states to conform to "standards" and   
"assessments" written by federal or state bureaucrats insulated from the   
influence of local citizens and their elected representatives. The grant   
applications also bind the states to spend money not yet appropriated by   
their legislatures.
<BR>

Fourteen California State Senators also dispatched a letter calling on   
Congress to "kill" H.R. 1617. They too objected to the transfer of   
legislative prerogative into the hands of the Governor, and opposed the   
establishment of a "National Electronic Data Base" to monitor the   
progress of students along predetermined career paths.

Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois voted for the CAREERS bill last year, but   
has since reversed himself. He is now urging the repeal of Goals 2000   
and the School to Work Act, as well as the defeat of H.R. 1617 and   
S.143. Such legislation, he contends, would turn schoolchildren into   
"guinea pigs who will become the human resources for the global labor   
market." Is that really what we want for our children?

<h2>The Working Rich</h2>


<i><blockquote>


There are many kinds of bigotry in the world, but most of them, in 
America at least, are recognized as morally repugnant. There is one kind 
of bigotry, however, that seems to be socially acceptable -- the irrational 
prejudice against people who are wealthy.
</blockquote></i>

The vast majority of rich people in America acquired their wealth the 
old-fashioned way: they earned it. Industriousness, determination, 
shrewdness, and daring -- these are the qualities they cultivated to 
achieve self-sufficiency and, ultimately, abundance. The relatively few 
Americans fortunate enough to inherit great wealth have had to display 
these same qualities in order to maintain their positions. Nevertheless, it 
is quite common -- among people who are lazy, aimless, dull, and timid -
- to bemoan their unfortunate lot in life and rail against the undeserved 
luck of those who happen to be rich.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Economist and syndicated columnist Thomas Sowell has had enough of 
this nonsense. "Far from being the idle rich, those in the top fifth of 
income-earners work more than most people and far more than those in 
the bottom fifth," says Sowell. "They work more time and they have 
more people in the same family working. When people are putting in 
long hours of work often after having put in long years of schooling, 
followed by long years of building up the skills and experience that put 
them where they are today, we are not talking about lottery winners or 
people who got lucky some other way. We are talking about 
achievement. And we are talking about the kind of work that other 
Americans benefit from."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Sowell cites Bill Gates as one man whose wealth is richly deserved. With 
his innovative computer software products, the Microsoft 
multimillionaire has provided enormous benefits, directly or indirectly, 
to every single American. "The economy is not a zero-sum game, where 
every gain is somebody else's loss," says Sowell. "We are all better off 
because of those [supposedly] 'fortunate' people who work long hours at 
difficult tasks that not everyone is capable of doing."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The generation of wealth generally requires long, hard work. For this 
reason, improved economic standing is usually associated with 
advancing age. The rich and the poor "are often the same people at 
different stages of their careers," says Thomas Sowell. "People in their 
60s have earned far more than people in their 20s, even though everyone 
in his 60s was once 20. This is not an injustice by 'society.' It is a 
reflection of the mundane fact that there is a huge difference in 
competence and efficiency before and after spending years doing what 
you do." Precious few people start out rich, and the vast majority of 
Americans who begin their careers in the bottom fifth in income "are out 
of there before a decade has passed. For one thing," says Sowell, "they 
have 10 years more experience at the end of a decade."

<h2> Welfare Reform/PA & OR </h2>


<i><blockquote>


Welfare as we know it is not long for this world. State governments all 
across America are redesigning so-called entitlement programs to make 
sure that they promote self-sufficiency rather than dependence.
</blockquote></i>
 
"Over the past five years a new consensus has emerged in the welfare 
debate," reports Peter Barwick of the Commonwealth Foundation in 
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. "In sharp contrast to the traditional view of 
welfare as an entitlement," says Barwick, "many experts now agree that 
welfare must require work, and that the single most important step that 
can be taken to reform welfare is to impose up-front work requirements 
on all able-bodied recipients. Support for this view comes not from a 
mean-spirited desire to punish welfare recipients, but from a concern to 
help welfare recipients achieve long-term self-sufficiency."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Barwick argues that the welfare reform plan proposed in Pennsylvania 
"falls short in its effort to replace welfare with work. To his credit, the 
Governor insists that welfare recipients work a minimum of twenty hours 
a week in order to receive benefits. Unfortunately, the significance of this 
requirement is vitiated by the fact that it can be satisfied with all sorts of 
substitute activities." Barwick contends that "the Governor's plan gives 
far too much wiggle room to those who would coddle recipients with 
notoriously ineffective and expensive 'education' and 'training' programs, 
or confine them to public-sector make-work programs which fail to give 
participants marketable skills and experience."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


One program that does effectively link welfare to work is Oregon's Full 
Employment model, known as JOBS Plus. This program, Barwick 
explains, "takes the money already allocated for the three largest welfare 
programs -- Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Food Stamps, and 
Unemployment Insurance -- and uses this money instead to subsidize 
jobs for welfare recipients in the private sector." Having proven quite 
successful during its two years as a pilot program, JOBS Plus is now 
being implemented statewide. Barwick notes that Oregon's Full 
Employment model "has been influential in shaping reform in nearly a 
dozen other states to date."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


How does the program work? "Participation in JOBS Plus is required of 
virtually all those who qualify for AFDC, Food Stamps, or 
Unemployment Insurance," observes Peter Barwick. "Participants are 
initially given assistance in finding regular full-time jobs. Those unable 
to find traditional employment are placed in subsidized jobs with private-
sector employers. These employers -- who volunteer for the program and 
have final say in all hiring decisions -- are reimbursed by the state for the 
minimum wage plus the employer's share of Social Security, 
Unemployment Insurance, and Workers' Compensation premiums. 
Subsidized jobs under JOBS Plus are temporary, lasting four months, 
with an optional two-month extension. Employers are free to hire 
satisfactory participants at any time during the process."
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

                                                                           
Poor people crave self-respect just like anyone else. Why not give them a 
chance to achieve it, with welfare reform programs that offer a hand-up 
rather than a handout?

<h2> Welfare Reform/MI & MA</h2>


<i><blockquote>


Why does private charity work so much better than public assistance? 
It's because the private benefactor expects to see results from his 
almsgiving. .</blockquote></i>

Private poverty-relief programs emphasize "character-building, one-on-
one mentoring, and a spiritual dimension," says Lawrence Reed of the 
Mackinac Center for Public Policy in Midland, Michigan. Government 
relief programs, on the other hand, generally promote the personal 
imperfections that perpetuate poverty. In the April issue of "Alternatives 
in Philanthropy," published by the Capital Research Center, Reed reports 
that his home state has drastically revamped its welfare program. 
"Michigan abruptly ended the General Assistance program for able-
bodied, childless adults in October 1991 and adopted a 'social contract,' 
whereby welfare recipients are expected to seek work, go to school, or 
perform community service in exchange for benefits," says Reed. "Nearly 
25 percent of Michigan's AFDC recipients are now working. This is 
three times the national average."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Reed thinks the Governor of Michigan is committed to "further reducing 
the role of government and making welfare a largely private initiative." 
He notes that "a growing number of private initiatives to help the poor 
are already underway, some of which sprouted in direct response to the 
state's abolition of General Assistance." Welfare as it currently operates 
"has produced such disastrous consequences that it's hard to imagine 
how a radical overhaul could make things worse," says Larry Reed. "If 
we revitalize the American ideals of charity and self-help, we might end 
up spending less for success than the government now spends for 
failure."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the same issue of "Alternatives in Philanthropy," David Tuerck of the 
Beacon Hill Institute in Boston reports that Massachusetts began its own 
welfare overhaul in 1995. "Able-bodied welfare recipients whose 
youngest children have entered school must work at least 20 hours per 
week in a job or community service program," notes Tuerck. "Parents 
under age 18 must live with a responsible adult or in a supervised group 
home. They must stay in school or in a GED program." They receive no 
additional benefits for children born after August 1996.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Though supportive of these reforms, Tuerck insists that the main 
problem with welfare is the way it is funded. "Under the existing system, 
taxpayers send their money to Washington, where most flows into a 
welfare bureaucracy and only a fraction eventually reaches the pockets of 
the poor." Tuerck would retain taxpayer funding of welfare, but make it 
taxpayer-controlled as well. He proposes that "individual taxpayers, both 
itemizers and non-itemizers, receive a 100 percent federal tax credit for 
contributions to eligible charities for up to 25 percent of their federal tax 
liability." David Tuerck argues that such a tax credit would not only 
increase private charitable giving beyond the level of the current public 
dole, but would also guarantee that a far greater percentage of those alms 
actually reach the intended recipients.

<h2> Welfare Reform/IN, WI, CO </h2>


<i><blockquote>





What is the real purpose of welfare? Is it meant to help the unfortunate 
get back on their feet, or was it designed from the beginning to create a 
permanent underclass? </blockquote></i>
<P>


"The focus of Indiana's welfare policy should be to help families become 
self-sufficient," says Andrew Bush of the Hudson Institute in 
Indianapolis. "Government can best achieve this goal by recognizing its 
own limitations and by drawing on the strengths of charities, 
community-based organizations, and other private service providers." In 
the April issue of "Alternatives in Philanthropy," published by the 
Capital Research Center, Bush reports on the Indiana Independence 
Initiative, a graduated work-based plan that "would dramatically change 
the orientation of welfare." This Initiative would help "able-bodied 
parents find immediate work," says Bush. It also "would open public aid 
to a wide range of non-government service providers that would help 
families pursue self-sufficiency."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the same issue of "Alternatives in Philanthropy," Michael Hartmann 
of the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute in Milwaukee reports that the 
Badger State "has imposed stringent work requirements on welfare 
recipients and has successfully moved many able-bodied recipients into 
productive work." Wisconsin's welfare caseload fell nearly 25 percent 
during a period in which state caseloads across the country "increased by 
an average of 35 percent." In 1988, Wisconsin implemented the Job 
Opportunities and Basic Skills program, which, as Hartmann explains, 
"required caseworkers to closely monitor and motivate welfare recipients 
in their search for employment." In 1993, the state implemented a 
program called Work, Not Welfare, which "limits AFDC payments to 
two years and offers major job-training services."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The state legislature recently approved a new program called Wisconsin 
Works, which provides "four graduated work options" for welfare 
recipients. "Recipients unable to perform self-sustaining work will 
engage in work activities, vocational rehabilitation, and counseling," 
says Hartmann of the first, transitional phase of the program. "Recipients 
will learn work habits and job skills necessary for employment in the 
private sector" by doing community-service jobs in the second phase. A 
period of subsidized employment follows, after which participants "will 
be guided to the best available immediate job in the private sector."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Also in the April issue of "Alternatives in Philanthropy," Tom Tancredo 
and Dwight Filley of the Independence Institute in Golden, Colorado 
point out that social pathologies such as juvenile delinquency, drug 
abuse, teen pregnancy, and welfare dependency have all been linked to 
"the absence of a married father in the household." Given this 
documented correlation, they ask, "why does government policy seem 
geared toward driving fathers away?" Despite the "oppressive burden of 
federal laws," Colorado still has "considerable latitude to end the 
perverse incentives that wreck families and contribute to our social ills," 
say Tancredo and Filley. "AFDC, for example, is a matching fund 
program. If the Colorado legislature refused to fund its share, AFDC 
would end in the state."

<h2> Welfare Reform/WA</h2>


<i><blockquote>
 

Demagogues may dismiss welfare reform as "discrimination against 
families, " but the truth is quite the opposite. </blockquote></i>
<P>
It isn't welfare reform that discriminates against families, but welfare 
itself, says John Carlson of the Washington Institute for Policy Studies in 
Seattle. "A young mother can receive a welfare check only if she doesn't 
marry the father, doesn't live at home, doesn't find a job, and doesn't save 
any money. You can't get much more anti-family than that," says 
Carlson. "Young men who father children out of wedlock don't have to 
take responsibility for their actions. The welfare system does it for them. 
And the mother isn't required to identify the father of the child. Again, 
you can't get much more anti-family than that."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the April issue of "Alternatives in Philanthropy," published by the 
Capital Research Center, Carlson argues that "we should apply the same 
kind of common sense to welfare reform that we would use if someone in 
our own family experienced trouble." A welfare reform bill now under 
consideration by the Washington State House of Representatives "would 
limit welfare benefits and include an additional period of reduced 
benefits for welfare recipients who are working. Recipients who don't 
look for work would have their benefits reduced. They could save money 
without being penalized, but cash benefits would not be increased for 
recipients who have more children."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the same issue of "Alternatives in Philanthropy," Lynn Harsh and Bob 
Williams of the Evergreen Freedom Foundation in Olympia, Washington 
agree that the welfare reform proposed in the State House "moves in the 
right direction." It provides for "a maximum of 36 months on 
assistance," requiring recipients to "sign contracts outlining their 
responsibilities" and to "participate in a job-training and job-search 
program." The legislation would require unwed mothers to identify "the 
fathers of their children," while denying cash payments to unmarried 
mothers who are minors. Harsh and Williams recommend that the 
reforms also include stringent enforcement of child support laws, the 
easing of restrictions on adoption, "greater tax incentives for charitable 
contributions," and the changing of program incentives "so that state 
welfare agencies redefine success as the number of people removed from 
welfare rolls and placed in long-term employment." The two policy 
analysts note that "the mere talk of tough welfare reform seems to be 
having an effect. Fewer people are applying for welfare in Washington 
State than last year despite no significant changes in the law or the 
economy."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Why not support what works? "Hundreds of charities, nonprofit 
organizations, and private-sector job-training and placement programs 
already serve the needy," observe Harsh and Williams. "Many of them 
have a proven record of operating efficiently and with a high degree of 
accountability. In the long run we advocate abolishing government-run 
welfare entirely. Far from being a cruel or reckless approach, this change 
would help renew our families, neighborhoods, churches, and 
communities -- the institutions best able to serve the needy."

<h2>"McCarthyism" </h2>


<i><blockquote>
<P>
When liberals accuse conservatives of "McCarthyism, " they're 
engaging in the very practice they claim to abhor. They're employing the 
infamous smear tactics of innuendo and guilt by association.
</I></Blockquote><P>


"McCarthyism" is a noxious term, so much so that any public figure 
accused of it becomes an instantaneous pariah. "McCarthyism" is also an 
ironic term, for two reasons. First, Senator Joseph McCarthy never 
engaged in any of the tactics associated with the term "McCarthyism." 
He did not make wild, unsubstantiated charges against hundreds of 
innocent people. He smeared no one. Second, the few dozen government 
employees that McCarthy did accuse of being Communists were just 
what he said they were. There was sufficient evidence at the time to 
warrant investigation of the figures he named. In the last four decades, 
the guilt of these person has been firmly established, and materials 
recently released from Soviet archives only add to the crushing weight of 
existing evidence.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If anything, McCarthy did not go far enough, concludes former FBI 
Assistant Director Ray Wannall. "The National Security Agency's 
release of the 'Venona' documents, intercepted communications of Soviet 
KGB officers in the United States to their bosses in Moscow, suggests 
that McCarthy's charges of government infiltration understated the 
reality," says Wannall. The Venona papers "underscore the fact that our 
government was massively riddled with Americans in high-ranking 
positions who were tilting policy to serve Soviet ends and engaging in 
espionage, including sharing our atomic secrets with Stalinist Russia."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Wannall argues that McCarthy had good reason to be "especially 
concerned about the State Department. Not only had the department 
been infiltrated by such high-ranking officials as Alger Hiss," but 
thousands of government personnel "had been merged into the 
department from other agencies following World War II," without first 
being screened for Communist affiliations and other security risks.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1948, two years before McCarthy leveled the charges that provoked a 
storm of simulated outrage, the House Committee on Un-American 
Activities reported that "there have been numerous Communist 
espionage rings at work in our executive agencies which have worked 
with and through the American Communist Party and its agents to relay 
to Russia vital information essential to our national defense and security. 
Russian Communists have worked hand in hand with American 
Communists in these espionage activities."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"In the wake of what we knew about communism and how thoroughly 
our government had been penetrated by Soviet agents before Joe 
McCarthy exploded onto the political scene," Wannall observes, "it is 
difficult to understand how so many Americans rallied to the anti-
McCarthy cause, or how the term 'McCarthyism' has taken on such a 
derisive tone." Wannall contends that many of McCarthy's critics were 
"apprehensive about what he might reveal concerning them and their 
friends, and they reacted with fury," using the very tactics that we have 
all been conditioned to associate with Joe McCarthy. History will one 
day record, however, that the only person smeared during the McCarthy 
era was McCarthy himself.

<h2> Truth About Communism </h2>


<i><blockquote>



John T. Flynn did not have access to the Venona documents, but he did 
have plenty of other evidence, when he tried to convince his skeptical 
countrymen of the truly insidious nature of the Communist conspiracy.
</blockquote></i><P>

John T. Flynn knew that "one of the greatest difficulties in explaining 
this menace is the inability of the normal, decent American to fully 
understand the peculiar nature of Communist methods." Nevertheless, in 
a nationally syndicated radio broadcast in 1954, Flynn charged that 
"among us is a sizable number of people [who] hate our American way. 
They want to end our free system and introduce a system more nearly 
resembling that of Russia. The State . . . will be supreme. It will own all 
the large industries . . . and, eventually, everything. This is socialism."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Flynn pointed out that Communists "seldom get elected to office. They 
cannot get power to act, at least not so long as they admit they are 
Communists. So their policy is to deny they are Communists or socialists 
and to insert themselves into influential positions in the Democratic or 
Republican parties and to get into bureaus where decisions on policy are 
made." Once they've weaseled their way in, "they use their weight to 
influence those policies of the government which will serve their ends 
and the ends of Soviet Russia."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Flynn charged that "secret cells began to operate in the important 
agencies of our government" in 1933. By the time of his broadcast, 
eleven years later, "thousands of these Reds had made their way into 
almost all of the most important spots in our government." Ensconced in 
positions of influence, "they took their orders directly from agents of the 
Russian espionage system stationed in New York and Washington."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The alarming extent of this penetration of our government was "brought 
out in a series of investigations in which the members of the House and 
the Senate who made the investigations were pilloried and denounced by 
the same newspapers and political leaders who [later denounced] Senator 
Joseph McCarthy. It was the influence of these cells which enabled the 
Soviet government, when World War II ended, to take over all of Eastern 
Europe and most of the continent of Asia, to penetrate our colleges, our 
public school system, many of our leading magazines and newspapers 
and news services."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Flynn recalled Senator McCarthy's famous 1950 speech in which "he 
charged that Communists in the State Department were helping to shape 
our policy in Asia and he put the number of Communists in a position to 
do this at 57. But he did not name them publicly. For this and a 
subsequent speech he was greeted by a storm of abuse." Flynn argued 
that "it takes a brave man to stand up against the savage abuse and the 
underground assaults which these Red conspirators pour out upon any 
loyal American who attempts to oppose them." He expressed intense 
admiration for "the undaunted stand [McCarthy took] against the 
malignant defenders of Russia and their confederates and dupes in the 
United States."

<h2> The Real McCarthy</h2>


<i><blockquote>



What exactly did Senator Joseph McCarthy do to provoke such a storm 
of protest in the early 1950s? Just his job, that's all!
</blockquote></i>
<P>
As chairman of the Senate Committee on Government Operations, 
Senator Joseph McCarthy was responsible for "watching this vast 
bureaucracy -- to spot graft, incompetence, extravagance, and disloyalty. 
As chairman of this committee [McCarthy was] merely carrying out his 
mandate in searching for cases of disloyalty inside the government." 
McCarthy did not wage his "war on communism any place but inside the 
government of the United States," asserted John T. Flynn in a nationally 
syndicated radio broadcast in 1954.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Of the slightly more than 200 witnesses who were examined publicly by 
the committee, more than a third refused to answer, most of whom 
invoked the Fifth Amendment. Flynn reminded his listeners that "almost 
all of these were government workers at various level of importance -- 
and in bureaus or agencies peculiarly subject to secrecy. The evil 
McCarthy [was] shooting at [was] treason. The people he [was] stalking 
[were] traitors -- most of them dedicated to the interest of our deadliest 
enemy at home and in the world, Communist Russia."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In addition to exposing the communist conspirators at the Institute of 
Pacific Relations (who had betrayed China and most of Asia to the 
Russians), McCarthy also uncovered agents in the Government Printing 
Office. "A great number of highly secret documents are printed in the 
Government Printing Office," Flynn observed. "The Senator found there 
persons with impressive records of Communist activity. The FBI had 
reported these persons repeatedly but nothing was done about it." Flynn 
noted that, as a result of McCarthy's investigations, "the entire security 
panel in the department was removed and all the security regulations 
overhauled. The penalty [for stealing secret documents] was changed 
from a few days suspension to dismissal." McCarthy's Committee also 
"conducted investigations at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, where highly 
secret radar equipment [was] developed. This resulted in the suspension 
of 33 security risks from this very sensitive U.S. Army spot."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The recently released Venona documents confirm what Flynn concluded 
in his 1954 broadcast: that "the most important objective of the 
Communist conspiracy has been to get Communists or Communist dupes 
inside our government departments. Their aim [was] to keep Russia 
advised of what the American government [was] doing and, even more 
important, to actually take part in shaping the decisions on policy of our 
government. The decisions to abandon Czechoslovakia, Poland, 
Hungary, Yugoslavia, Eastern Germany, and a part of Austria to Russia 
as World War II ended were all accomplished by Communists and pro-
Reds in our State Department."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Infiltration of our government was "the most important enterprise of the 
Communist conspiracy in America," said John T. Flynn. "It has cost 
millions of dollars, the lives of numerous men, and incredible labor and 
patience on the part of the Communist leaders." Flynn insisted that 
"McCarthy was not persecuting radicals or even Communists. His aim 
was only at Communists and spies inside the American government."

<title>Duplantier: CORELESS CURRICULA -- 6/06/96</title>

<h2> Coreless Curricula </h2>


<i><blockquote>


"In demolishing the notion of a relatively stable body of knowledge, a 
traditional set of disciplines to which developing thinkers must 
apprentice themselves, [American universities] have invited their 
students, though half-formed and ill educated, to indulge in a fantasy of 
their own extravagant powers." </blockquote></i>
<P>

In the Spring issue of the Manhattan Institute's "City Journal," 
contributing editor Kay Hymowitz examines the American university 
system and laments "the complete disappearance of a fixed, coherent 
curriculum and with it any shared notion of the well-educated man or 
woman. All that once ordered higher education -- requirements, majors, 
the traditional disciplines, the core curriculum -- is vanishing into the 
chaos of postmodernism. The structured, comprehensive, directed course 
of study has been replaced by a "do-your-own-thing curriculum."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How do the universities explain this great shirking of their responsibility, 
and the intellectual aimlessness to which they've condemned a 
generation? It's all for the best, they say. They did it on purpose! "The 
college brochures yield plenty of examples of how the academy has tried 
to transform the shattering of the curriculum into a boon for students," 
reports Hymowitz. These glitzy sales packets promise the unformed, 
undisciplined student suffocating amounts of the very things he doesn't 
need: "flexibility, openness, independence, freedom." By encouraging 
their students to believe that "they can, in all their ripe perfection, step 
outside society and each create his own one-man culture," the 
universities renounce their very reason for being, which is to encourage 
breadth of learning and an appreciation for the interconnectedness of 
things. <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"The sheer proliferation of courses . . . amplifies the illusion of 
undergraduate freedom," says Hymowitz, adding that "the hundreds of 
thousands of choices available to students stretch the distribution 
requirement to the borders of triviality." Even when a student is required 
to take a specified number of courses from each of certain broad 
categories -- such as humanities, sciences, and social sciences -- he can 
satisfy the requirement with courses so lame or esoteric that he fails to 
acquire even an overview of the discipline.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


"The myth of the college brochure begins with an illusory student: not 
just independent but self-motivated, passionate, self-aware, well-
informed. Consider instead the reality of the college student just 
graduated from an American public school," Hymowitz urges. "Surveys 
suggest he knows little about, among many other things, American 
history. Does he ponder his ignorance in this area and sign up for an 
American history course? Of course not. The libertarian curriculum 
neglects the obvious: the student doesn't know what he doesn't know. 
Further, he doesn't know what he needs to know to be a well-informed 
member of society. That's why someone invented required courses."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The rapidly multiplying menu of course offerings perpetuates "the 
mystique of specialization, which renders archaic the entire notion of a 
shared world of knowledge," says Kay Hymowitz. "Such an approach, 
with its glorification of unencumbered autonomy and individual choice, 
provides no foundation for social solidarity and active citizenship."

<h2>Great Awakening</h2>


<i><blockquote>


There have been three dramatic religious revivals in American history, 
and some social commentators claim that we are, right now, in the midst 
of a fourth "Great Awakening." </blockquote></i>

<P>


Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition believes that America is "a nation 
in which one becomes American not by accident of birth or by ethnic 
heritage, but by subscribing to an idea." In the April issue of "Imprimis," 
the monthly journal of Hillsdale College, Reed argues that America is 
the embodiment of  "a vision -- a vision of a society based on two 
fundamental beliefs. The first is that all men, created equal in the eyes of 
God with certain unalienable rights, are free to pursue the longings of 
their hearts. The second belief is that the sole purpose of government is 
to protect those rights."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Reed asserts that our Founding Fathers "possessed a view of the world 
and government that necessarily presupposed a people obedient to an 
internalized code of conduct . . . that made a large central government 
superfluous." That internalized code of conduct is based on the Ten 
Commandments. America was at the outset, and still is, "a nation 
undergirded by faith, built by faith, and enlivened by faith."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Today, however, the connection between faith and government "is a 
source of vigorous controversy," says Reed. He notes that "a crucial 
debate rages in the land over the role of religion in our public life and 
the role that religious believers should play in our politics. The religious 
conservative vote . . . is now one of the largest, if not the largest, single 
voting bloc in the electorate." Reed predicts that the election in 
November "will not be decided by the union vote, the feminist vote, the 
minority vote, or the third-party vote. It will be decided by the religious 
vote." The upcoming election will be characterized by "the largest 
mobilization of active religious believers in recent memory. And, if 
history is any guide, this mobilization is the sign of another period of 
great transformation in America, for political change in the United 
States has always been rooted in religious upheaval."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Reed concedes that "mainline church membership has declined by one-
fourth" in recent decades. But this decline has been "more than made up 
for by the skyrocketing popularity of conservative and evangelical 
churches in which membership has doubled." What has resulted "is a 
complete transformation of America's churchgoing population. Today, 
the typical American churchgoer is orthodox in faith, traditionalist in 
outlook, and conservative on cultural and political issues. Yet, as active 
religious believers move beyond the pews and into public life, a strange 
and disturbing hostility greets them," says Reed. "People of faith have 
become victims of the worst forms of stereotyping, marginalization, and 
demonology." It's time, he argues, to ''reaffirm the role of religion in 
public life" and to "encourage those with strong spiritual beliefs to re-
enter politics after too many years of self-imposed retreat. Religious 
believers must become full citizens."

<h2>Kinsey Part I</h2>


<i><blockquote>
<p>
Sex education programs in schools across America are based in part on studies published by Alfred Kinsey in 1948 and 1953 called Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female.  
</I></Blockquote>
<p> 
Representative Steve Stockman (R-1X) thinks the world-famous Kinsey Institute in Bloomington, Indiana should be investigated for possible fraud and criminal child abuse. Late last year, Stockman introduced the Child Protection and Ethics in Education Act of 1995 ( H.R. 2749), calling for a General Accounting Office probe of the government funded  studies of human sexuality conducted by Alfred Kinsey   
nearly 50 years ago. If the GAO concludes that "criminal wrongdoing or scientific fraud" did occur in the preparation of the Kinsey Reports, then "any organization or school [that] uses these studies, without indicating the unethical and unscientific nature, will be denied federal funds for any educational purpose."  
<p>
Congressman Stockman tried to determine on his own the source for the data in Table 34, a chart in the original Kinsey Report that purported to measure the sexual responsiveness of infants, children, and teenagers. His efforts turned into a wild goose chase. "First, I was told by the Kinsey Institute  that the data were compiled from the notes of a single pedophile who is deceased," recalls Stockman. "But, according to Kinsey's book, the table was composed from the observations of 'several adult males who have had sexual contacts with younger boys."'  
<p>
Either way, Kinsey's research into the sexuality of children -- upon which professionals rely heavily for their understanding of normal childhood development -- apparently rests on the testimony of at least one sexual deviant. "This indicates that the basis of sex education in America is a study of the systematic molestation of children as young as four months old," says Stockman. The only other alternative is that Table 34 is a complete fabrication. "Other scholars who worked  with Kinsey in the early '50s have said that the numbers . . . were made up -- fraudulent research," he observes. Stockman  says the purpose of the Child Protection and Ethics in Education Act is "to determine to what extent the United States Government funded these fraudulent and criminal studies and what liabilities should be assessed."  
<p>
In a letter to his colleagues in Congress, Stockman pointed out that the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States (known as SIECUS) bases its own widely-used and often-imitated sex-ed programs on the studies of Alfred Kinsey. "These texts," he observed, "form the basis of sex education in the public schools of America." Stockman urged his fellow Congressmen to view a videotape called The Children of Table 34, produced by the Family Research Council. The 30-minute expose charges that data recorded in the Kinsey Reports are based on "systematic molestation of infants and children." The documentary concludes that the evidence of fraud and ethical violations in Kinsey's research  warrants an inquiry into the Kinsey Institute.

<h2>Kinsey, Pt. II </h2>


<i><blockquote>
<P>
According to a videotape expose released by the Family   
Research Council in 1994, Alfred Kinsey's famous research   
on human sexuality was either fraudulent or based on   
"criminal experimentation on children funded by taxpayers. " 
</I></Blockquote><P>

A 30-minute documentary entitled The Children of Table 34   
charges that Kinsey incorporated into his research data from   
the rape of children and infants, that he used these records of   
perversion and criminality as the basis for his influential   
observations on normal childhood development, and that he   
not only concealed the full extent of his experiments but   
shielded the adults involved in them from criminal   
prosecution. 
<p>
In a booklet that accompanies the videotape,   
Robert Knight of the Family Research Council observes that   
Kinsey's 1948 report, Sexual Behavior in the Human Male,   
and his 1953 study, Sexual Behavior in the Human Female,   
"ignited a controversy over sexual morality that persists to   
this day. Both painted a picture of Americans of all ages   
awash in secret sexual experimentation." The philosophy of   
Kinsey and his cohorts "placed all sexual acts on the same   
moral, social, and biological level." The Kinsey Reports, says   
Knight, "provided the [seemingly] 'scientific' foundation for   
America's sexual revolution."  
  <p>
That foundation remained unchallenged until 1981, when Dr.   
Judith Reisman offered a critique of Kinsey's research at the   
Fifth World Congress of Sexology in Jerusalem. "She began   
asking questions that have yet to be answered," says Knight.   
"How did the Kinsey team obtain the data on children? Did   
parents give consent? Was there any follow-up on the   
recorded experiments? Where are the children now?"  
  <p>
Nearly 10 years later, Dr. Reisman attempted to answer some   
of these questions with a book called Kinsey, Sex and Fraud.   
The book, says Knight, "reveals shocking evidence that   
children were sexually abused by adults in the name of   
science." But that was just the beginning of the tragedy.   
Kinsey's bogus and/or criminal research became the basis for   
a burgeoning sex-education industry. "The Kinsey data are   
the sole source of child sexuality data, since no other   
researchers have been willing to risk criminal prosecution for   
reporting on or conducting systematic molestation of   
children," Knight explains. Kinsey's conclusions "have   
permeated America's educational institutions and are the   
major behavioral model on which sex education programs are   
designed for children."  
 <p> 
Today, sex education programs in schools across America   
"systematically strip children of sexual modesty, ridicule the   
idea of sexual restraint . . . and reduce parents' roles to that of   
consultants, not authorities in their children's lives. The   
[rationalization] for this radical departure from traditional   
sexual morality begins with the Kinsey Reports," says   
Knight. "Kinsey's work remains an underpinning for many   
ongoing federally-sponsored research programs," he adds,   
noting that a group with close ties to Kinsey, the Sex   
Information and Education Council of the United States   
(known as SIECUS), was chosen in 1994 "to evaluate sex   
education programs throughout the United States and to make   
recommendations to the federal government."

<h2>SIECUS</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
The Sex Information and Education Council of the United   
States (known as SIECUS) applauds the dramatic increase in   
the number of states that require or recommend sex education   
in public schools. 
</I></Blockquote><P>

A 1994 SIECUS survey of state sex-ed programs reported   
that 44 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rieo have   
gotten on the bandwagon since 1986, when only three states   
required such curricula. The focus of the SIECUS   
assessment, however, was on the alleged "shortcomings" of   
the state curricula, as determined by deviations from the   
group's own Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality   
Education, K-12, which SIECUS published in 1991. Those 
guidelines include six "key concepts," subdivided into 36   
topics. The key concepts are Human Development,   
Relationships, Personal Skills, Sexual Behavior, Sexual   
Health, and Society and Culture.  
 <p>
The 1994 SIECUS study, entitled Unfinished Business,   
consisted of three major components: the responses of state   
education officials to a 20-question survey; the analysis by   
SIECUS of various state-developed sex-ed curricula; and   
SIECUS's own recommendations for changing curricula to   
conform with their biases about sex education. Resources   
cited for the study include the Alan Guttmacher Institute,   
Planned Parenthood, the Center for Population Options, the   
National Education Association, and People for the American   
Way. Funding for the study was provided by the Carnegie   
Corporation.  
<p>  
The SIECUS study complained that many state curricula   
guides "omit sexual behavior topics; exclude topics that are   
considered controversial, such as sexual identity and   
orientation and abortion; lack thorough coverage of topics   
throughout grades Kindergarten-Twelve, particularly in the   
elementary grades; and lack [what SIECUS calls] balanced   
coverage of abstinence and safer sex." SIECUS says such   
shortcomings represent "unfinished business."  
<p>  
The study laments the absence from most curricula of   
"detailed age-appropriate developmental messages." That is   
the SIECUS euphemism for statements that lay the   
foundation for easier acceptance of permissive sexual   
practices at a higher grade level. When it comes to coverage   
of sexual behavior, SIECUS complains that most curricula   
are guilty of a "fear-based" approach, which means that they   
emphasize abstinence and portray sex as something more   
profound than a recreational activity. To achieve what   
SIECUS calls "balance," the curricula would have to present   
"safer sex" as a more realistic option than abstinence.  
 <p> 
SIECUS rejects the "just say no" approach in sex education,   
asserting that it does "not provide corresponding refusal skills   
or assertiveness messages." For SIECUS, refusal skills are   
sexual negotiation techniques that students can acquire   
through role-playing and instruction in the art of explicit   
conversation. SIECUS ignores the fact that such techniques   
undermine the natural modesty of children (their most potent   
defense), and the likelihood that mastery of refusal skills   
would enable an aggressive negotiator to overcome them.  
 <p> 
Few sex-ed curricula begin early enough for SIECUS. The   
group deplores the benighted parents and right-wing pressure   
groups that have impeded "comprehensive" sex education.   
SIECUS urges a state-funded effort to combat these so-called   
obstructionists.

<h2>Student Rights</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
The education establishment is kicking up a ruckus over a bill   
that received nearly unanimous support in the House of   
Representatives. They're determined to make sure that this   
sensible legislation doesn't get past the Senate.
</I></Blockquote><P>


The Family Privacy Protection Act would prohibit schools   
from questioning minors about political or religious   
affiliations or beliefs, mental or psychological problems,   
sexual behavior or attitudes, illegal or self-incriminating   
behavior, or their opinions of other family members --   
without first obtaining the permission of their parents. The   
need for such a law is clear when schools make a practice of   
bypassing the informed consent of parents to distribute   
condoms to adolescents and subject even younger children to   
coercive physical exams.  
 <p> 
The widespread use of intrusive surveys and questionnaires   
in the public school classroom started in the mid-l 970s and   
led to the passage of the first Protection of Pupil Rights   
Amendment in 1978, sponsored by former university   
president and Senator Sam Hayakawa. The public school   
establishment was powerful enough to prevent regulations   
from being written until President Ronald Reagan demanded   
them in 1984. National Education Association agents in the   
Department of Education and public school administrators   
nationwide still managed to thwart the enforcement of this   
law.  
  <p>
Take, for example, the infamous 149-question survey which   
has been given, despite parental objections, to nearly all 6th,   
9th and 12th grade Minnesota pupils. Parents protested the   
survey's invasion of privacy, as well as its underlying   
assumption that illegal drug use, promiscuity, and suicidal   
tendencies are normal teenage behavior. They also objected   
to way in which the survey encouraged pupils to inform on   
their parents.  
  <p>
Among other things, the survey inquired about the drinking   
habits of family members, to ascertain if their use of alcohol   
had "repeatedly caused family, health, job or legal problems."   
Many questions conveyed the notion that the majority of   
teenagers are using illegal drugs. Some questions interrogated   
the child about his religion. Certain questions -- particularly   
those relating to severe depression and attempted suicide --   
were undoubtedly traumatic for some children. The survey   
also sought to determine the sexual experience and practices   
of the students. It shouldn't need to be said -- though it   
obviously does -- that public schools have no business   
requiring children to answer any of these nosy questions   
without prior written parental consent.  
  <p>
The purpose of the Family Privacy Protection Act is to   
extend the scope of the law to all surveys and questionnaires   
that are federally funded, not merely those funded by the   
Department of Education, and also to remove some vague   
language that has enabled the public schools to circumvent   
the law for the past ten years. The Senate will no doubt be   
besieged by self-styled researchers whose prurient interest in   
the sexuality of children is facilitated by unfettered access to   
our nation's schools. Let's hope our Senators recognize that   
these schools exist only to educate our children -- not to   
provide a steady supply of guinea pigs for behavioral   
scientists.

<h2>Foreign Aid</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
The Clinton administration would have us believe that U.S.   
foreign aid promotes American interests around the globe,   
but this simply isn't so. Foreign aid is a luxury we can ill   
afford, especially when it has adverse consequences.
</I></Blockquote><P>
Believe it or not, most recipients of U.S. foreign aid vote   
against the United States in the United Nations most of the   
time. Roughly 64 percent did so in 1995, according to a   
recent report from the Heritage Foundation. Policy analyst   
Ryan Johnson offers several disturbing examples.  
  <p>
Nigeria voted against the U.S. 69 percent of the time in 1995,   
but we'll send Nigeria nearly $27 million this year despite its   
lack of support. The top ten countries voting against U.S.   
interests the most -- India, Laos, China, Lebanon, Seychelles,   
Pakistan, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Djibouti, and Burkina Faso -  
- will receive a combined total of nearly $212 million in   
foreign aid this year. Why are we rewarding these ingrates?  
  <p>
Of-the ten nations receiving the most American aid -- Israel,   
Egypt, Russia, Ukraine, India, Peru, Bolivia, Ethiopia, Haiti,   
and South Africa -- only Israel, Russia, and Ukraine voted   
with us more often than not. Egypt, for instance, will receive   
over $2 billion in aid this year despite voting against us 67   
percent of the time last year. India will collect more than   
$150 million in U.S. aid, after having voted against us 83   
percent of the time.  
  <p>
Russia, surprisingly enough, voted against the U.S. only 33   
percent of the time. It's worth noting, also, that nine of the   
U.S.'s ten strongest supporters in the U.N. are former Soviet   
bloc countries! They are: Tajikistan, Latvia, Georgia,   
Uzbekistan, Hungary, Estonia, Lithuania, Slovenia, and   
Macedonia. Israel, which will receive over $3 billion in aid   
this year, is our strongest supporter, voting with the U.S. 97   
percent of the time.  
  <p>
If the U.N. voting records of aid recipients accurately reflect   
their support for U.S. policies, "the U.S. is not getting its   
money's worth," says Johnson. "There may be many reasons   
why a country votes with or against the U.S. at the UN," he   
observes. "But it is clear from these data that foreign aid does   
not win friends where it counts: in supporting U.S.   
diplomatic initiatives at the United Nations. Clearly, the   
foreign aid program in general, and under the Clinton   
administration in particular, has done little to justify public   
confidence that tax dollars are being used wisely by   
America's foreign aid bureaucracy."  
  <p>
In short, foreign aid is not working. "Why, then, is the U.S.   
spending so much money on countries that obviously care   
little about America's interests abroad? And why is the   
Clinton administration fighting to save this program when   
most Americans are opposed to it?" asks- Bryan Johnson of   
the Heritage Foundation. "Last year, Congress tried to cut the   
U.S. foreign aid budget as part of its plan to reduce wasteful   
government spending and balance the federal budget deficit,"   
notes Johnson. "Because the Clinton administration fought   
these proposals, Congress was unable to make more   
significant cuts in foreign aid."

<h2>Orphanages</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
Orphanages filled a vital need in America for more than a   
hundred years -- until meddling do-gooders decided that   
these benevolent institutions were somehow inhumane! 
</I></Blockquote><P>

"In the colonial era small children without parents were taken   
in by relatives or cared for informally by neighbors; older   
children were indentured to a master who would teach them a   
trade," observes Marvin Olasky in the May issue of   
Philanthropy, Culture & Society, published by the Capital   
Research Center. "Apprenticeship bore no stigma since it was   
common to send a child at 13 or so into another person's   
home for training or education; all who had hands capable of   
work were expected to use them at an early age." As of 1800,   
there were no more than seven institutions in America for   
parentless children.  
  <p>
"The number of orphanages grew throughout the first half of   
the nineteenth century largely in connection with an   
outpouring of evangelical benevolence," says Olasky. "Every   
epidemic . . . created orphans and new orphanage efforts; by   
1850 there were between 71 and 77. Individual and church   
contributions paid most of the cost, but it was not-unusual to   
have -municipalities pay up to a third, and for expenses to be   
held down through some work by the orphans themselves.   
The Civil War greatly expanded demand for orphanages, and   
the supply skyrocketed to over 600 by 1880. Character as   
well as quantity changed, however," says Olasky, noting that   
"in the late 1800s children of destitute single parents   
increasingly found their way to orphanages."  
  <p>
What was life like in these institutions? "Orphanage directors   
during the second half of the nineteenth century saw their   
mission as not merely furnishing basic material needs but   
creating model American citizens," says Olasky. "They tried   
to instill virtues such as thrift, self-reliance, and sobriety, and   
to create a capacity for hard work; they believed in busy daily   
routines and strict discipline."  
  <p>
By 1910, there were more than 100,000 children in American   
orphanages. "The word 'orphanage' itself became a   
misnomer," says Olasky, "as children of parents who were   
still living but had problems with finances or alcohol found   
the institutions safer and better than life at home. Yet, even   
though the quality of care was evident to observers, reporting   
of orphanages started to turn negative in tone. Much of the   
criticism had an ideological tinge, portraying [these   
benevolent institutions] as materially satisfactory but   
psychologically inhumane."  
 <p> 
As often happens, yellow journalism set the stage for   
government intervention. "Two White House Conferences on   
the Care of Dependent Children, in 1909 and 1919, bent in an   
anti-orphanage direction," observes Olasky; they concluded   
that "single mothers were to receive financial aid so children   
could stay at home, and orphans or those completely   
abandoned should be placed in foster care." It was not long   
before states took over the task that orphanages had   
performed. Marvin Olasky argues that children were better   
off before the government started running their lives.

<h2>Charity</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
Man does not live by bread alone. Why, then, does our   
welfare system offer nothing more? 
</I></Blockquote><P>

In the March issue of Philanthropy, Culture & Society,   
Marvin Olasky argues that "we must go beyond   
sentimentality and learn how to fight poverty the right way,   
the biblical way, the way that was practiced in America until   
recent decades." Olasky says "the reason why government   
welfare programs must be transformed is not that they are too   
expensive. The real problem is that they are too stingy about   
doing what is truly important: treating people as human   
beings made in God's image, not as animals to be fed, caged,   
and occasionally petted." He asserts that "private programs   
can do a better job if they are challenging, personal, and   
spiritual."  
  <p>
So, what did our forebears do differently? "During the l9th   
century, before the federal government ever got involved, a   
war on poverty much more successful than our own was   
waged by tens of thousands of local, private charitable   
agencies and religious groups around the country," observes   
Olasky. He concedes that "poverty fighters a century ago did   
not abolish poverty," but insists that "they witnessed a   
movement out of poverty by millions of people." Attitudes   
were different in those days, among beneficiaries as well as   
benefactors. "The optimism prevalent then contrasts sharply   
with the demoralization among the poor and the cynicism   
among the better-off that is so common now," says Olasky.   
Our forebears "knew that the literal meaning of compassion   
is not just writing a check, but having personal involvement   
with the needy, suffering with them, not just giving money to   
them."  
  <p>
Olasky contends that 19th-century Americans "knew that   
people should be challenged. When an able-bodied man came   
to a homeless shelter, he often was asked to chop wood for   
two hours or to whitewash a building. In that way he could   
provide part of his own support and also help those unable to   
chop. They knew . . . that even the most rundown person is   
not just a taker; he can also be a giver. They knew that   
everyone is made in God's image and is capable of helping."  
  <p>
America has paid a terrible toll for its forgetfulness. "We've   
forgotten America's past successes in poverty-fighting," says   
Olasky. "The result has been not just the waste of billions of   
dollars each year, but the death of part of the American   
dream." Welfare, says Olasky, "kills dreams." Not only "the   
dreams of poor individuals who gradually become used to   
dependency," but also "the dreams of children who grow up   
without fathers," and countless other dreams that coercive   
measures cannot fulfill.  
  <p>
Olasky reports that "across America people of many faiths,   
income levels, and races are refusing to give up on the dream   
of effective compassion. More people are capturing the   
understanding that the major flaw of the modern welfare state   
is not that it is extravagant, but that it is too stingy. It gives   
the needy bread and tells them to be content with that alone."

<h2>Welfare Reform/CA & IL</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
With Congress talking about bloc-granting welfare money    
back to the states, some good ideas are starting to circulate.
</I></Blockquote><P>

There are nearly three million Californians receiving Aid to    
Families with Dependent Children (known as AFDC),    
roughly two million of whom have been on the dole for more    
than two years. "To a large extent, California's history of high    
AFDC benefits is responsible for the entrenched cycle of    
poverty that many now decry," say Sally Pipes and Katherine    
Post of the Pacific Research Institute in San Francisco. A    
new proposal by the California Department of Social    
Services is designed to break that "cycle of poverty" by    
substantially reducing benefits.   
   <p>
"Benefit levels would be lowered and one standard payment    
set," say Pipes and Post in the May issue of Alternatives in    
Philanthropy, published by the Capital Research Center.    
"Welfare would not pay more than work." This "flat grant"    
would not be affected by "any increase in the number of    
adults or children in the household." Benefits would be    
available for a limited time only. "The grant would eliminate    
eligibility requirements that make aid available only when    
one parent is deceased, disabled, missing, or unemployed,"    
say Pipes and Post. "Eligibility would instead be based on a    
simple income and asset test, as well as on the presence of a    
child under 18 years of age."   
   <p>
In spite of these promising proposals, California has been    
"fundamentally unable to respond to the particularities of    
individual cases. Herein lies an opportunity for philanthropic    
alternatives," say Pipes and Post, who like to stress "the    
importance of private efforts that are successfully addressing    
the critical and massive problem of repairing the damage    
done by the welfare state. Private programs offer powerful,    
individual-oriented approaches that no government initiative    
can match."   
   <p>
Joseph Bast of the Heartland Institute in Palatine, Illinois    
argues that welfare reforms in his state don't go far enough,    
and consist mainly of "throwing good money after bad and    
reshuffling bureaucracies." .In 1994, the state's Governor    
proposed "a $5 billion-a-year state-run health maintenance    
organization." In 1996, the Governor proposed "creating a    
welfare super-agency by merging seven cabinet-level    
agencies and many other boards, commissions, and    
programs."   
   <p>
Bast argues that different reforms "could generate much    
greater benefits more quickly." He calls for "health-care    
vouchers that would give the needy a wider choice of medical    
providers and insurers." He proposes that the care of abused    
and neglected children be turned over "to private agencies    
that have a better track record of placing children into safe    
and stable homes." And he suggests that AFDC payments be    
limited to two years and that the state "remove from the rolls    
all those who fail to report to state offices when told to do so"    
for job training and referrals.   
   <p>
The great thing about America is that our 50 states give us    
the chance to address problems in different ways. Welfare is    
a big problem, and we need all the good ideas we can get.

<h2>Welfare Reform/IA &SC</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
Iowa and South Carolina offer two examples of innovative   
welfare reform.
</I></Blockquote><P>

"In 1993, the Iowa state legislature enacted a welfare reform   
program designed to help welfare recipients become self-  
sufficient,'' reports Amy Frantz of the Public Interest Institute   
in Mount Pleasant, Iowa. Writing in the May issue of   
Alternatives in Philanthropy, published by the Capital   
Research Center, Frantz relates that Aid to Families with   
Dependent Children (known as AFDC) "was replaced with   
the Family Investment Program [which] provides cash   
benefits to participants based on their assets, income, and   
family size." Participants in the program "must sign a   
contract, called the Family Investment Agreement, in which   
they promise to participate in Iowa's employment program,   
Promise Jobs." The program provides such services as   
"education and job training, resume writing, and [instruction   
in] interviewing techniques."  
  <p>
Participants in the Family Investment Program "must agree to   
meet a timetable for achieving self-sufficiency,'' says Frantz.   
"Those who refuse to sign a Family Investment Agreement   
must enter a Limited Benefit Plan. This pays reduced benefits   
for three months, then terminates all benefits." Under-aged   
parents who have not yet finished high school "must pursue   
their diplomas to receive benefits."  
  <p>
Frantz reports that "Iowa has also created programs that   
allow private organizations to help those in the Family   
Investment Program." Individual Development Accounts, for   
example, "are held by low-income individuals and can be   
used for post-secondary education, the purchase of a home, or   
starting a small business," says Frantz. "In addition to funds   
that individuals contribute to [these accounts], community-  
based organizations can provide matching funds."  
  <p>
Also in the May issue of Alternatives in Philanthropy, Mike   
Hubbard of the South Carolina Policy Council Education   
Foundation in Columbia reports that South Carolina "has   
joined a growing number of states that have enacted major   
welfare reform. Last year, the General Assembly passed the   
Family Independence Act, requiring the South Carolina   
Department of Social Services to reorient its mission from   
distributing welfare checks to helping welfare recipients find   
jobs." The state must obtain "waivers from certain federal   
laws and regulations," however, before it can implement   
some of the proposed reforms. "Unfortunately," says   
Hubbard, "the Clinton administration is fighting the state   
over most of these, delaying the full impact of reform."  
  <p>
The Family Independence Act redefines success for state   
agencies as "a shrinking caseload and an increase in the   
number of recipients placed in jobs," Hubbard continues.   
"Benefits are limited to 24 consecutive months," and new   
applicants for welfare must "prove they have been looking   
for work." South Carolina goes to great lengths to facilitate   
that job search. "The state helps recipients relocate to areas   
with better job opportunities," for example, and offers   
employers "a tax credit for hiring and maintaining   
recipients." The program is practical rather than sentimental,   
however. "Teenage unwed mothers must live with a parent or   
guardian," says Hubbard, and fathers who fail to pay child   
support have their drivers licenses and other sporting and   
professional licenses revoked.

<h2>Welfare Reform/GA & OH</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
Georgia and Ohio offer two examples of how states are  
moving toward welfare reform.
</I></Blockquote><P>

"Many of the welfare reforms implemented in Georgia in  
recent years lack the boldness of initiatives in other states and  
contain too many exceptions to be truly effective," contends  
Kelly McCutchen of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation in  
Atlanta. Nevertheless, they have had an effect, combining  
with a bustling economy to reduce the welfare rolls by 6,000  
families in a single year. 
 <p>
"Probably the greatest problem facing Georgia's welfare  
system is the state's illegitimacy rate," says McCutchen in the  
May issue of Alternatives in Philanthropy, published by the  
Capital Research Center. The state began to address this  
problem in 1994 by denying cash benefits "to unwed teen  
mothers who choose to live on their own," notes McCutchen.  
"The following year, the number of teen mothers living  
independently dropped by 50 percent." In 1996, the state  
stopped its perverse practice of increasing benefits "to  
welfare recipients who have additional children." 
 <p>
The state should not encourage illegitimacy, nor should it  
subsidize indolence. "Able-bodied welfare recipients who  
quit or refuse to take full-time jobs face a reduction in  
benefits,'' says McCutchen. Under the state's latest initiative,  
called Work First, Georgia is "advising social workers that  
finding jobs for recipients is their number-one objective. It is  
also offering businesses tax credits and subsidies, giving  
them an incentive to hire and train welfare recipients." 
 <p>
McCutchen argues that there are "three key elements of  
welfare reform." The first is establishment of paternity. "The  
state," she says, "must send a clear message to teenage boys  
that they will be held financially responsible for any children  
they engender." The second key element of welfare reform is  
benefit reduction. "Welfare recipients should not be better off  
than those who work," she says. The third element is a work  
requirement. "Welfare recipients must not be allowed to stay  
at home and collect benefits." The ultimate objective of  
welfare reform, however, is to get community-based  
organizations back in the driver's seat. "When government  
moved into social welfare," notes McCutchen, "other  
institutions -- families, businesses, churches, and charities --  
were shunted aside. They must once again assume primary  
roles." 
<p> 
In the same issue of Alternatives in Philanthropy, Samuel  
Staley and Douglas Hyne of the Buckeye Institute for Public  
Policy Solutions in Dayton report that General Assistance in  
Ohio "began to be phased out in 1992 and was eliminated in  
1995. This has already saved the state $900 million," they  
observe. Ohio has also implemented a program called JOBS,  
which stands for Job Opportunities and Basic Skills. The  
program "requires a large number of welfare recipients to  
enroll in job-training programs. Refusal to participate results  
in a loss of welfare benefits,'' say Staley and Hyne.  
"Combined with state-mandated self-sufficiency contracts  
that outline steps recipients must take to prepare for  
employment, Ohio's JOBS participation sanctions are  
considered some of the toughest in the nation."

<h2>Anticipating "The Pacific Century"</h2>

     It's become faddish in our lifetimes to name each decade
     according to its defining characteristic. One presumptuous
     prognosticator has preempted this process by naming an entire
     century, before it begins.
<p>
     "During the past decade, the world's center of gravity has
     shifted," observes Jesse Helms. "And it will continue to move
     eastward away from Europe, toward Asia," says the senior Senator
     from North Carolina, "because, as the nations of Eastern Europe
     and the states of the former Soviet Union were struggling to
     break free of communism, Pacific Rim nations were busily taking
     care of business at home." This historic shift will usher in what
     Helms calls "The Pacific Century."
<p>
     How will this affect America? It should redound to our benefit.
     "The Asia-Pacific region currently accounts for more than 40
     percent of the world's trade and U.S.-Pacific Rim trade has
     outpaced trade across the Atlantic," says Helms. "Thankfully for
     the United States -- though the political and economic center of
     gravity may have shifted West to East, Europe to Asia -- we
     remain uniquely positioned . . . at the center. The United States
     thus remains the world's anchor."
<p>
     Senator Helms warns, however, that the United States "cannot be
     the best nation in the world unless we are willing to lead the
     world. We cannot lead by being the world's policeman, nor the
     world's babysitter, but by being what we have been for most of
     the 20th century -- the standard-bearer of moral, political, and
     military might and right, an example towards which all others
     aspire."
<p>
     Current U.S. leadership is not setting that example. "In just a
     few short years, the Clinton administration has managed to warp
     U.S.-Asia policy so badly that, at any one time, the United
     States is at odds with China, Japan, and the Korean peninsula.
     Right now, many Asian nations fear that we are propelling
     ourselves down the road to irrelevance," says Helms. "In China,
     the United States has neither a strategy, nor resolve, for
     dealing with areas of key interest to the United States. On the
     Korean peninsula, this administration has given lip service to
     our allies in South Korea while dealing directly with the North
     Koreans." Helms says the U.S. must preserve "its role in the
     dominant region of the 21st century. We must have priorities, and
     we must stand up for them."
<p>
     It is in America's best interests to "maintain open and peaceful
     shipping waters for trade" in the Pacific, says Helms. It is
     vitally important that we "maintain a strategic balance among
     China, Japan, the Korean peninsula, and Southeast Asia." It
     behooves us to "push for more open, less regulated markets for
     U.S. goods and services," and to "show the nations in the region
     that we are serious about their adherence to bilateral and
     multilateral agreements." Helms stresses that we should
     "strengthen the friendships we maintain with our true allies in
     the region -- Taiwan and South Korea, to name just two -- rather
     than coddle dictators because we fear that we might lose market
     share."

<h2>Big Government Destined For Ashbin</h2>


     Containing the threat, refuting the notion that its triumph was
     inevitable, seizing the moral high ground, defunding the enemy --
     these tactics toppled the Soviet empire and won the Cold War.
     They could also put an end to Big Government in America.
<p>
     "The old Republican coalition of northerners, big business,
     farmers, and professionals has given way to a modern Republican
     coalition of individuals and groups who share a common goal: They
     all want to be left alone by the government," says Grover
     Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform in the May issue of
     Imprimis, the monthly publication of Hillsdale College. This
     "Leave Us Alone" coalition consists of taxpayers, property
     owners, small businessmen, gun owners, home schoolers, and other
     pro-family, traditional values conservatives -- all of whom want
     government out of their pockets and off their backs.
<p>
     "The Left as embodied in the Democratic Party is a 'Takings'
     coalition," says Norquist, "made up of groups that want the
     government to take things -- usually money -- from other
     Americans and give it to them. This coalition includes government
     workers, unions, government contractors, corrupt big-city
     machines, federal grant recipients, left-wing intellectuals, and
     both wings of the `dependency lobby' (those locked into welfare
     dependency and those who earn a handsome living managing that
     deliberately never-ending dependency)." This coalition is also
     home to "the radical utopians who wish to use the power of the
     state to restructure society. They include the radical leaders of
     the feminist, homosexual, environmentalist, and animal rights
     movements."
<p>
     The "Takings" coalition is shrinking. The "Leave Us Alone"
     coalition, on the other hand, continues to grow, built, as it is,
     "around a single political principle consistent with American
     history and tradition -- that government should be limited and
     the people free." Norquist says this coalition has "embarked
     consciously on a four-part strategy to defeat the Washington
     establishment and the old Democratic majority. It is the same
     strategy that successfully broke the back of the Soviet empire."
<p>
     As it applies to Big Government in America, containment means
     firm opposition to tax increases. Norquist notes that more and
     more of our elected representatives are getting on the tax-ban
     bandwagon. As for inevitability, it's not the triumph of
     socialism that looms before us, but "devolution of power to the
     states, a private Social Security system, school choice, and
     welfare reform." The Right succeeded in seizing the moral high
     ground with "principled opposition to the welfare state's
     destruction of lives." Defunding the enemy is all that remains.
     "Conservatives," Norquist observes, "are beginning to cut off the
     flow of tax-payer funds and coerced labor union dues to the
     Left."
<p>
     "Freedom is on the march around the globe," says Norquist. "There
     is a great deal of work to be done, but the imperial city of
     Washington will fall to the forces of freedom just as Moscow did.
     It is as hollow, as brittle, and as bereft of self-confidence.
     The 'Leave Us Alone' coalition is growing, and it is fighting on
     the winning side of history."

<title>Duplantier: Colorado's Amendment 2 -- 7/8/96</title>

July 8, 1996<br><p></i>
<h2>Colorado's Amendment 2</h2>

<i>The Constitution of the United States says nothing about homosexuality. 
Under the 10th Amendment, therefore, any efforts to regulate 
manifestations of this conduct should be within the province of the states 
and the people.</i>
<p>
In his vigorous dissent from the Supreme Court's recent decision 
overturning Colorado's Amendment 2, Justice Antonin Scalia described 
the statewide ban on laws providing special treatment for homosexuals as 
"a modest attempt . . . to preserve traditional sexual mores against the 
efforts of a politically powerful minority." Scalia argued that the Court's 
ruling contradicts its own 1986 decision upholding Georgia's anti-
sodomy law "and places the prestige of this institution behind the 
proposition that opposition to homosexuality is as reprehensible as racial 
or religious bias."
<p>
The High Court ignored the question of "whether there was a legitimate 
rational basis for the substance of the constitutional amendment -- for the 
prohibition of special protection for homosexuals. It is unsurprising that 
the Court avoids discussion of this question," says Scalia, "since the 
answer is so obviously yes. The case most relevant to the issue," he says, 
"is not even mentioned in the court's opinion: In Bowers v. Hardwick, we 
held that the Constitution does not prohibit what virtually all states had 
done from the founding of the Republic until very recent years -- making 
homosexual conduct a crime." Scalia points out the obvious 
contradiction: "If it is constitutionally permissible for a state to make 
homosexual conduct criminal, surely it is constitutionally permissible for 
a state to enact other laws merely disfavoring homosexual conduct."
<p>
Scalia argues that nothing in the Constitution "prohibits what Colorado 
has done here. But the case for Colorado is much stronger than that. What 
it has done is not only unprohibited, but eminently reasonable." He 
recalls how three Colorado cities "enacted ordinances that listed 'sexual 
orientation' as an impermissible ground for discrimination, equating the 
moral disapproval of homosexual conduct with racial and religious 
bigotry." Conceding that "homosexuals are as entitled to use the legal 
system for reinforcement of their moral sentiments as are the rest of 
society," Scalia insists nevertheless that "they are subject to being 
countered by lawful, democratic countermeasures as well. That is where 
Amendment 2 came in. It put directly, to all the citizens of the state, the 
question: Should homosexuality be given special protection? They 
answered no."
<p>
Scalia contends that the Supreme Court decision overturning Colorado's 
Amendment 2 "has no foundation in American constitutional law, and 
barely pretends to. The people of Colorado have adopted an entirely 
reasonable provision which does not even disfavor homosexuals in any 
substantive sense, but merely denies them preferential treatment. 
Amendment 2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration of the 
sexual morality favored by a majority of Coloradans, and is not only an 
appropriate means to that legitimate end, but a means that Americans 
have employed before. Striking it down is an act not of judicial judgment, 
but of political will."

<h2>
Property Rights
</h2>

<i>"Property is power. If the government owned or controlled all the 
property, it would possess all the power."</i>
<p>
The League of Private Property Voters periodically releases an index 
recording Congressional votes relating to property rights and rating our 
elected representatives according to their respect for private property. 
"There was a major change in Congress in 1994 and private property 
rights continued to grow as a major political issue during the first half of 
the 104th Congress," reports the League. "Consequently, more and more 
politicians climbed on the bandwagon and proclaimed steadfast support 
of property rights." In their 1995-96 Private Property Vote Index, 
recording 15 House votes and 10 Senate votes, the League documents "a 
dramatic improvement in the House of Representatives, with a modest 
gain in the Senate in the 104th Congress. Private property rights were a 
significant part of the Contract With America in the House," the League 
explains. "However, the Senate slowed progress down significantly."
<p>
The change of party control in Congress brought "many more private 
property advocates into committee chairmanships and other positions of 
power. However, there was a powerful split between Western private 
property advocates and Eastern representatives, who generally have a 
lower awareness of the vital nature of private property rights." The 
League reports that the House and Senate passed bills restricting the use 
of unfunded mandates, thereby slowing "the massive increase in Federal 
regulations which invariably lead to 'taking' private property rights. But 
in the area of regulatory reform, risk assessment, private property rights, 
and wetlands compensation, fast House action was faced with a stonewall 
in the Senate." The League contends that there is "a groundswell of 
support to reform the Endangered Species Act and Section 404 wetlands 
regulations," but warns that "the Green advocacy groups have mounted a 
well-financed counter offensive with great success."
<p>
The League argues that "secure and enforceable property rights are 
necessary for civil order. When property ownership becomes vague and 
unsettled, strife and social breakdown soon follow." The League notes 
that "our free market economy is based on secure and enforceable 
property rights." They point out that "private property is what allows 
people to pursue their own goals, independent of the state or society." 
Contrary to what many people think, private property rights are also 
necessary for the protection of the environment. "When people own 
resources in common, they take as much as they can as quickly as they 
can," the League observes. "Many of the professional environmental 
pressure groups often deny the crucial role of property rights in 
protecting the environment. That is because political power means more 
to them than the health of the environment."
<p>
The League points out that "our system of limited government, including 
our constitutional rights, survives because of the widespread ownership 
of property." If it were not for this widespread ownership, "our 
constitutional rights would become mere paper rights, unenforceable 
against an all-powerful government. That is why the protection of private 
property rights should concern all Americans, whether they own property 
or not."

<title>Duplantier: On-The-Job Training -- 7/12/96</title>

<h2>
On-The-Job Training
</h2>

<i>The experience a person gains on the job is often worth far more than 
the wages he receives.</i>
<p>
"Some commentators argue that unfair foreign competition and callous 
executives have destroyed the social contract between employers and 
employees," observes John Hood of the Heritage Foundation in the June 
issue of Policy Review. "Others say that inexorable economic and social 
trends, such as the Information Revolution, are enlarging the prospects 
for highly skilled workers while displacing those with less education." 
There is general agreement, however, "that America must raise the 
educational levels of its workers. But would-be reformers," says Hood, 
"often forget that the largest educational system in the United States is 
neither the public schools nor institutions of higher learning. It is the 
education and training workers receive from their employers or in the 
private marketplace."
<p>
Almost every workplace in America offers endless opportunities for 
"lifelong learning." All that's needed is the gumption to take advantage of 
them. "Workers learn new skills, information, and problem-solving 
strategies virtually every day, in formal courses or on the job," says 
Hood. "Motivated by competition and the search for greater value, many 
businesses try to raise productivity through training programs. In the long 
run, such efforts pay off in larger profits, better products, and higher 
wages." Hood reports that "about 50 million workers received some kind 
of formal training" in 1995, at a cost to their employers of more than $50 
billion. Throw in another $300 billion in informal training, and you've 
got a sizable investment in the American worker.
<p>
This is a win-win situation for employers and employees. "Workers who 
become more skilled in their jobs are more productive," observes Hood. 
"Also, studies show that training can raise employee loyalty and reduce 
turnover, in part because workers often find their skills to be more 
valuable at the firm where they were acquired." College graduates who 
rest on their laurels often find themselves earning less than "workers 
without college degrees who nevertheless have obtained specific training 
for their jobs."
<p>
Of course, employees who lack a basic education and a decent work ethic 
are not likely to benefit no matter how much money is spent on them. 
"Despite this enormous investment in training, many workers have few or 
no marketable skills," says Hood. "The problem is one of wasted 
resources. Public schools spend a tremendous amount of tax money but 
often fail to prepare young people academically to benefit from training 
later on. Government sponsored job-training programs have consistently 
posted mediocre returns on the billions of dollars in tax money they 
spent."
<p>
John Hood argues that "federal and state subsidies encourage students to 
pursue post-secondary training in an inefficient manner. Federally 
guaranteed student loans and generous state subsidies entice students to 
enroll in colleges, but a surprisingly low percentage graduate. The time 
students waste in irrelevant (and often outdated) community-college and 
university classes," he suggests, "might be better spent finding an 
employer that teaches useful skills."

<h2>
 States Lead Reform, Part I
</h2>

<i>1994 was a watershed year for Republicans, but that dramatic 
Congressional election may have less impact than the changes made on 
the state level.</i>
<p>
"Since the Republican victories of November 8, 1994, the press has 
focused on the dramatic changes in Congress. With a net gain of 52 seats 
in the U.S. House of Representatives and eight seats in the U.S. Senate, 
the Republicans took control of both houses of Congress for the first time 
in 40 years," observes Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform. 
"Party-switching and special elections have since left the partisan balance 
in the House of Representatives at 236 Republicans to 198 Democrats 
(with one independent); in the Senate, it is 53 Republicans to 47 
Democrats."
<p>
Norquist acknowledges the tremendous impact on national politics of this 
party realignment, but insists, nevertheless, that Washington is not where 
the action is. Writing in the June issue of Policy Review, Norquist argues 
that "the intense focus on Washington DC has obscured the conservative 
revolution within the states. In some ways, the changes occurring in state 
capitals across the country are even more important than those inside the 
Beltway," he contends. "Conservative reforms at the state level make 
similar efforts in Washington both more likely and, oddly, less important. 
The states have led the way so far, and they are quite prepared to march 
ahead even if the revolution in Washington stalls."
<p>
Norquist contends that "the 1994 shift in partisan control was more 
pronounced at the state and local levels than in Washington. Republicans 
won 24 of 36 gubernatorial races to increase the number of statehouses in 
their column from 19 to 30," he reports. The vast majority of Americans 
"now live in states with Republican governors." This historic, 
comprehensive realignment "affects the content of the policy debate in at 
least two ways. First, it intensifies the pressure from the states for more 
autonomy," says Norquist. "Second, a Republican Congress is more 
likely to fulfill its commitment to 'devolution' knowing that ideologically 
sympathetic governors are at the helm in many key states."
<p>
The example of reform-minded Governors, who practice what they 
preach about cutting big government, may be just what our Congressmen 
need to help them stick to their guns. "In Washington, political reform 
has been frustrated by a recalcitrant Senate and Bill Clinton's veto pen," 
observes Grover Norquist. "Of the Contract with America's 10 specific 
items, Congress has passed only the line-item veto, procedural reforms in 
the House of Representatives, and the Congressional Accountability Act, 
which brings Congress somewhat under the same laws it imposes upon 
business. The House has passed the Balanced Budget Amendment, 
regulatory reform, and other legislation, only to see them watered down 
or stopped in the Senate. Bill Clinton has twice vetoed welfare reform, 
and a relatively narrow tort-reform bill was passed over his veto."
<p>
The states are having more success. "The new generation of Republican 
governors and state legislators is advancing the Republican reform 
agenda," says Norquist, "from tax cuts to tort reform."

<h2>
 States Lead Reform, Part II
</h2>

<i>Don't be frustrated by the slow pace of political reform in our nation 's 
capital. Take heart in the dramatic progress being made by our sovereign 
states.</i>
<p>
"In 1995, while Republicans in Congress were debating a $500-per-child 
tax credit and cutting the capital-gains tax in half, 17 states with 
Republican governors cut taxes," reports Grover Norquist of Americans 
for Tax Reform. Writing in the June issue of Policy Review, Norquist 
notes that, last year, "12 Republican governors took on one of the fiercest 
Democratic special-interest groups -- the trial lawyers -- and won. While 
Congress was only able to enact a very limited reform of frivolous 
stockholder lawsuits, Republican governors made significant strides."
<p>
Tax reform and tort reform are just two of the many historic changes now 
occurring throughout these United States. "The latest Republican anti-
crime agenda has made little headway in Washington, where the Senate 
has failed to act on a package of bills passed by the House," says 
Norquist. "Meanwhile, Republican governors led the way in enacting 
'truth-in-sentencing' laws that require violent criminals to serve at least 85 
percent of their sentences. " A majority of states have also passed 
legislation allowing for the carrying of concealed handguns.
<p>
The states are not waiting for Washington to reform welfare and health 
care, either. "Although Bill Clinton has vetoed the Republican welfare-
reform bill," says Norquist, "Republican governors continue to 
experiment with efforts to free individuals from the dependency of 
welfare." Clinton may have vetoed Medicare reform and Medical Savings 
Accounts, but five Republican governors "shepherded Medical Savings 
Accounts through their state legislatures. These forays into market-based 
health care will have a significant effect on overall medical costs and 
insurance premiums," says Norquist, "contributing substantially to the 
debate in Washington, and perhaps eventually ending the impasse. And, 
when Congress does finally enact reforms in Medicare, the states will 
already have in place the mechanisms to take full advantage of it."
<p>
The states are also outpacing Congress in providing protection for 
property rights. "In March 1995, the U.S. House of Representatives 
passed legislation recognizing that the Takings Clause of the Constitution 
is invoked when government actions destroy or reduce the value of 
private property, not just when the property is physically occupied by 
government. That legislation has not seen final action, of course," notes 
Norquist, but that hasn't stopped the states from pushing ahead. 
"Beginning in 1992, the states began passing legislation protecting the 
property rights of their citizens. To date, 23 states have enacted 
legislation of varying strength, and more efforts are under way."
<p>
Our sovereign states seem to be asserting themselves once again. This 
bodes well for America. "All the Republican governors are traveling in 
the same direction and showing real courage in tackling the special 
interests of the old establishment order," says Grover Norquist. They've 
declared war on the welfare state, and they're not taking any prisoners.

<h2>
Gambling
</h2>

<i>"Roughly three-quarters of all Americans now gamble -- and they have 
an abundance of venues from which to try their luck. Presently 48 of the 
50 states allow one or more forms of legalized gambling."</i>
<p>
"More and more state governments have seized upon legalized gambling 
as a revenue-generating gold mine -- a voluntary tax willingly paid out by 
citizens enamored with visions of quick riches," says Robert Reno of 
Focus on the Family. "This development has reversed government's 
historic position as a gambling regulator. Instead, state governments are 
now pouring resources into promotion and marketing, attempting to 
induce citizens to gamble." Once hooked on the tamer forms of gaming, 
state governments soon lose their resistance to the more intense forms. "A 
state's initial foray into the gambling arena is frequently via a lottery," 
notes Reno. "After an initial flurry of activity, revenues from the lottery 
begin to decline. However, the state becomes increasingly dependent on 
gambling revenues, and therefore must offer other, more attractive, ways 
to entice citizens to part with their money." Reno points out that, "by 
introducing the lottery, government also expands the potential market for 
other gambling ventures." Research shows that "gambling participation 
rates increased sharply as states increased the number of forms of 
gambling allowed."
<p>
Politicians make a lot of extravagant promises to justify the legalization 
of gambling, but somehow the promises don't pan out. "Gambling 
proponents in government frequently justify their stance by noting that a 
significant portion of the proceeds are earmarked for education, public 
works, or other such projects intended to benefit communities," observes 
Robert Reno. "However, they often fail to mention both the unreliability 
of gambling as a revenue source . . . and the fact that diverting gambling 
funds to such projects often yields little, if any, net gain in funding for 
those projects."
<p>
Reno confirms that "the introduction of gambling on a widespread basis 
correlates with a marked increase in crime." For one thing, "gambling 
tends to attract a criminal element." For another, problem gamblers 
frequently "turn to crime to finance their involvement." Researcher 
Robert Reno notes that "one of the alleged benefits often cited by 
proponents of legalized gambling" is that it allows state governments to 
"undercut illegal gambling and thus hinder organized crime." Au 
contraire! "By enlarging the pool of bettors and, at the same time, 
reducing gambling's stigma," says Reno, "the state actually creates an 
increased market for illegal gambling activities."
<p>
Gambling is not the economic godsend the hucksters would have us 
believe. In fact, says Robert Reno, "the net economic effects are often 
negative." That's because "gambling-related jobs tend to be low-paying; 
other businesses suffer from the introduction of gambling; and gambling 
is associated with a host of costly social problems." What does gambling 
really offer? "A legacy of broken families and shattered lives," says 
Reno, "not to mention a price tag to society that runs into the billions of 
dollars. The government's present infatuation with and promotion of 
gambling," he concludes, "is unconscionable in light of the devastation."

<h2>
America's Future's Record
</h2>

<i>America's future depends on Americans who believe in America. That's 
why America's Future was founded fifty years ago!</i>
<p>
When America's Future was founded, fifty years ago, the Second World 
War had just concluded and the United Nations had just been born. The 
Cold War had not yet begun, and neither had the conservative movement. 
Fifty years ago, there were only a handful of conservative, 
constitutionalist, free-market-oriented organizations and publications. But 
the number of liberal, leftist, and crypt )communist groups in America 
numbered more than a thousand.
<p>
Our nation was in transition in 1946, and our enemies were well-
organized. Stouthearted individuals and intrepid organizations were 
needed to defend the American way of life. And so, on April 24, 1946, 
America's Future, a nonprofit educational organization, was founded in 
New York City by a group of businessmen dedicated to the preservation 
of two great fundamental American principles: the competitive, private 
enterprise system that has made our country strong and prosperous, and 
the constitutional form of government that has kept us free from the 
tyranny of dictators or factions.
<p>
From the very beginning, America's Future concentrated its educational 
efforts on the proverbial man-on-the-fence, the uncommitted millions, 
students eager to learn about their country and its traditions, educators 
and ministers (who are the prime targets of the collectivists), parents 
concerned about the future of their children, workers who have benefited 
from the free enterprise system, and voters who control the destiny of our 
nation. Beginning in 1946, America's Future sponsored and produced 
over the ABC Radio Network a Sunday afternoon commentary featuring 
Congressman Samuel Pettengill, a renowned constitutionalist. We also 
began publishing and distributing pro-American books, pamphlets, and 
reprints (now numbering in the millions).
<p>
In the 1950s, one of the country's most influential print and broadcast 
commentators, John T. Flynn, joined forces with America's Future. Flynn 
was a frequent contributor to prestigious national magazines; and his 
book, The Road Ahead, which showed how socialism was creeping 
across England and the United States, sold more than one million copies. 
Flynn pulled no punches. He went behind the headlines to explain the 
real significance of events and personalities. He attacked Big 
Government and Big Business with equal vigor, always from the 
perspective of an unwavering, unapologetic Americanism. His 
commentaries for America's Future, aptly named "Behind The 
Headlines," were soon being broadcast on more than 300 radio stations in 
the Mutual Broadcasting System. Commentaries by Flynn were also 
distributed to thousands of newspapers across the country, with an 
estimated readership of twenty million.
<p>
That's how America's Future began, fifty years ago. Today, with the vast 
majority of Americans now identifying themselves as conservatives and 
the liberal welfare state discredited, we like to think that we can claim 
some of the credit, and we invite you to join us in celebrating the Golden 
Anniversary of America's Future.

<h2>
John T. Flynn on Socialism
</h2>

<i>The former managing editor of the New York Globe, John T. Flynn was 
a frequent contributor to America's most prestigious magazines, the best-
selling author of several books on the evils of socialism, and the 
originator of our Behind The Headlines commentaries.</i>
<p>
"A socialist society cannot be organized and conducted by the federal 
government under our Constitution," wrote John T. Flynn in his book 
called The Decline of the American Republic, And How to Rebuild It, 
republished in condensed form in 1957 in America's Future's All-
American Book Digest. "There is not one sentence in the Constitution," 
said Flynn, "that would authorize the federal government to socialize our 
medical facilities, to regulate or finance our schools, to engage in 
industrial or mercantile enterprise, or to carry on any of that multitude of 
activities which have, as a matter of record, brought the federal 
government into almost every kind of business in one degree or another. 
The great limitations on the federal government; were specifically set 
down in the Constitution."
<p>
Flynn pointed out that the Constitution was designed "to bring into 
existence a government that possessed all the powers necessary to defend 
the nation from foreign enemies and to guarantee to all the citizens 
certain great fundamental rights of freemen, and to leave to the states -- 
the several small republics -- the powers essential to the government of a 
free people." The Constitution thus stood as an insurmountable barrier to 
power-hungry socialists -until Franklin Delano Roosevelt acceded to the 
presidency. "Despite all the endless care exercised by the framers of the 
Constitution, and the judgments of the Courts for 148 years," Flynn 
lamented, "the revolutionary elements in the United States found a way in 
which to complete their perversion and subversion of the Constitution 
without submitting these radical changes to the states [which were] the 
only authority empowered to make changes in the Constitution."
<p>
Flynn explained how this was accomplished: "The Supreme Court is 
empowered, under the Constitution, to 'interpret' the meaning of the 
Constitution where questions of judicial differences appear," he observed. 
"It had, according to its time-honored practice, interpreted the 
Constitution to mean what its framers wanted it to mean. There was, 
therefore, but one course open to the revolutionary cabal in Washington. 
It was a plan to change the Constitution, literally to wreck the whole 
fundamental structure of the American government . . . by judicial 
interpretation."
<p>
And so, the safeguards were discarded, and America got its taste of 
socialism. "The vast and compulsive apparatus of government had been 
dismembered by our forefathers and its various parts entrusted to a 
variety of agencies," observed John T. Flynn, to ensure that our federal 
government would never have "sufficient power to oppress the citizen." 
But the power that our Founding Fathers so wisely divided was 
recombined "by the decisions of a group of judges who were put on the 
bench in a revolutionary maneuver to give to words in the Constitution 
wholly new meanings."

<title>Duplantier: World Heritage Areas -- 8/8/96</title>

August 8, 1996</i><br><p>
<h2>WORLD HERITAGE AREAS</h2>

<i>Did you know that the United Nations has sovereign control over 
Yellowstone Park? That's right, the UN, for all practical purposes, owns 
Yellowstone National Park!</i>
<p>
World-famous Yellowstone Park in Montana was visited by UN officials 
last fall, but they weren't there on vacation! Tom Deweese of the 
American Policy Center reports that these internationalist bureaucrats 
were "inspecting a site for a proposed gold mine . . . located on property 
outside of the Yellowstone National Park boundaries." In a recent issue of 
his group's newsletter, called Insider's Report, Deweese revealed what 
these world-governing wannabes were up to. "Radical environmentalists 
who oppose the mine development deliberately brought the UN into the 
debate in an attempt to stop it," he explained. "The decision of the UN 
site inspectors will determine if the mine may be developed. Their 
decision will end the debate."<p>

You heard correctly. This isn't some paranoid, futuristic fantasy. It's real, 
and it's happening right now. The UN is deciding whether or not 
American citizens have the right to put their own property to productive 
use. "What does the United Nations have to do with determining how 
land is used inside United States territory?" you ask. Deweese provides 
the shocking answer. "The United Nations," he says, "has sovereign 
control of Yellowstone Park."<p>

According to Deweese, radical environmentalists "invoked a little known 
treaty called the World Heritage Convention in order to involve the 
United Nations in an internal United States dispute. Jimmy Carter, in 
1978, signed the treaty and thereby designated Yellowstone a World 
Heritage Site. Now the United Nations has ultimate say in what happens 
to the park." Though not on park land, the site of the proposed mine 
happens to fall into the treaty-mandated "buffer zone."<p>

"There are several more World Heritage Sites within U.S. borders," 
observes Deweese. And, if you're not scandalized already, you will be, 
when you hear what two of them are: the Statue of Liberty in New York 
harbor and Independence Hall in Philadelphia! "That's right," says 
Deweese; "the United Nations controls the spot where America's 
Founding Fathers created our nation." In other words, authority over the 
two most famous symbols of our freedom has been ceded to an 
organization that seeks to destroy that freedom.<p>

"The World Heritage Convention is just one of a series of treaties that the 
United States has signed in the past few decades that grant control to the 
United Nations over U.S. law," Deweese points out. "Most of these 
treaties now have programs already in place to grab U.S. soil. And son e 
of these programs are much worse than just taking our nation's 
landmarks. Some have targeted all of the private property in the nation. 
That means your home." Perhaps the worst offender is the UN 
Convention on Biological Diversity, which, Tom Deweese charges, "lays 
down the plans for a 'reversal' of the process of civilization, ultimately 
overseeing the herding of people into pre-selected, isolated enclaves, 
while the rest of America becomes vast wilderness."<p>

<i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br>
  <a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">
F. R. Duplantier</a><br>    
August 9, 1996</i><br><p> 
<h2> PROTECTING PROPERTY RIGHTS</h2>
<p>
<i>"The federal government increasingly passes the costs of its policies on 
to private property owners. To protect species under the Endangered 
Species Act, to preserve wetlands under the Clean Water Act, or to effect 
some other such goal, the government typically prohibits or constrains 
property owners from using their property as they wish. "</i>
<p>
"Although the United States was founded on the principle that 
government should not be allowed unfettered power to impose its will on 
law-abiding citizens or seize their property, federal agencies have found a 
loophole that allows them to usurp property through regulation," observes 
John Shanahan of the Heritage Foundation. "These regulatory takings can 
strip any American of the right to use his land as he wishes. In some 
cases, they even can almost wipe out the value of that land -- and, with it, 
the life savings of individual citizens."
<p>
The Private Property Protection Act of 1995, passed by the House last 
year, "would require compensation by the regulating federal agency 
whenever regulatory restriction of property rights under the Endangered 
Species Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act exceeds 20 percent 
of the value of the regulated parcel," observes Shanahan. The Omnibus 
Property Rights Act of 1995, now under consideration in the Senate, 
"would require compensation by federal regulating agencies whenever 
the taking of some 'portion' of property diminishes the value by 33 
percent."
<p>
Both bills seek to reinforce the U.S. Constitution's unambiguous 
endorsement of property rights. "The Fifth Amendment implicitly 
recognizes that the federal government may take property for public use," 
concedes Shanahan, but "explicitly mandates that government must pay 
the property owner for the land confiscated." It thereby "ensures that the 
cost is borne by those who benefit -- the public -- and not by the citizen 
unfortunate enough to own the land the government requires." Any 
federal regulation that deprives an American citizen of the full use of his 
property violates the spirit, if not the letter, of the Constitution. "Just 
compensation for regulatory takings preserves individual civil rights," 
argues Shanahan, noting that "property rights are essential to preventing 
the usurpation of other rights under the Constitution."
<p>
Imagine the consequences if there were no Fifth Amendment. "If 
government had a free hand to take property without payment, the 
incentive to confiscate property that conferred only a small public benefit 
would be overwhelming," says Shanahan. "In fact, that is exactly what 
has happened. The federal government now owns 30 percent of 
America's land, with even higher percentages in the West, and is using 
regulatory takings with increasing frequency to enhance its effective 
control over even more extensive tracts."
<p>
Compensation requirements are needed to discourage the federal 
government from confiscating property. The problem today, says John 
Shanahan, is that "federal enforcement officials have found that they can 
use regulations to gain control of property while circumventing the just 
compensation requirements of the Constitution. Federal property rights 
legislation thus is needed to provide a standard that will force federal 
regulators to consider the costs and benefits of taking private property."

 <i> September 5, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2> NEA Resolutions </h2><p>                           




<i>The National Education Association maintains one of thefive largest federal Political Action Committees in the country. The teachers union donated 99 percent of its PAC money to the Democrats in 1994 It's important to know, then, where this influential group stands on various issues.</i><p>


Ninety-one percent of the nine thousand delegates attending the NEA convention in Washington DC over the July Fourth weekend voted to endorse Bill Clinton for reelection as President of the United States. Clinton was on hand to accept the NEA's Friend of Education Award, and to present his plan for education reform, which included Internet access for every public school classroom in America, tax credits for anyone wanting to attend a-cornmunity college, and a $10 million program to combat truancy. The President proposed financial penalties for mothers and fathers who miss parent-teacher conferences, or whose children skip classes. He also recommended that the government provide "intensive counseling" for such parents.<p>

Resolutions approved at the 1996 NEA Convention were more circumspect than last year's bombshells, but they still exhibited hostility to traditional values and the rights of parents. Needless to say, the delegates called for increased federal funding for public education, in particular for programs designed to alleviate "sexual orientation discrimination." They argued that the "immigration status of students or their parents" should have no bearing on eligibility for public school attendance. And they insisted that privatization, performance contracting, tuition tax credits, and voucher plans are "detrimental to public education and must be eliminated."<p>

NEA delegates endorsed "early childhood education programs in the public schools for children from birth through age eight." Such programs would include "a full continuum of services for parents and children, including child care, child development, developmentally appropriate and diversity-based curricula, special education. and anorooriate bias-free screening devices."<p>

 

NEA delegates asserted an "increasingly important role" for public schools in providing sex education. "Teachers and health professionals," they contend, "must be legally protected from censorship and lawsuits." Otherwise, they might have to think twice about offering instruction in birth control usage and perverted sexual techniques. "To facilitate the realization of human potential," the delegates proclaimed, "it is the right of every individual to live in an environment of freely available information, knowledge, and wisdom about sexuality." The delegates also called for "comprehensive AIDS education programs as an integral part of the school curriculum."<p>

The NEA insists that homeschooling students "meet all state requirements. Instruction should be by persons who are licensed by the appropriate state education licensure agency, and a curriculum approved by the state department of education should be used." Less adamant about holding its own members responsible, the teachers union opposes "standardized testing that is mandated by local, state, or national authority [and] the use of these tests to compare one student, staff member, school, or district with another." Not surprisingly, NEA delegates resolved that "competency testing must not be used as a condition of employment, license retention, evaluation, placement, ranking, or promotion of licensed teachers."<p>

<title>Duplantier: Separating School & State -- 9/06/96</title>

<h2> Separating School & State </h2><p>                           



<i>The federal government doesn't run the churches in America Why should it run the schools?</i><p>

"In America, we don't use the government to run the churches; and, considering our diversity, we have admirable religious harmony," observes Marshall Fritz in the July issue of The Freeman. Fritz believes that "this 'hands-off" policy is America's greatest gift to the human race." He recommends that the policy be extended to the field of education, as well, calling for "the separation of school and state."<p>

A former Christian school principal, Fritz is the founder of the Separation of School and State Alliance, which advocates the dismantling of the public school system in America. "People have long pondered why parent-funded private schools seem to work fairly well . . . and tax-funded public schools seem to be going downhill at an increasing speed," Fritz remarks. "In fact, public-school educators are scrambling to imitate the non-essential features of private schools. Some call for uniforms, son e want 'values' programs, all clamor for fewer layers of administration in their hopes to reverse their downward plunge. The stampede has gone so far that even union leaders are calling for . . . 'more choice and market dynamics."' They just don't get it, says Fritz. "In their call for 'market dynamics,' union leaders miss the real secret of success of parent-funded schools: parental responsibility."<p>

This, Fritz declares, is "the key difference between tax-funded and parent-funded schools. Parent-funded schools have a high percentage of parents who are fully exercising their parental rights in education, and tax-funded schools have few such parents." Fritz explains that "parents who directly provide for their children's education sacrifice. That act both reflects and influences their attitude about their children's education. In contrast, paying taxes . . . is neither investment nor sacrifice. One is not deferring gratificat on, but merely avoiding pain. Coercion is central to the financing of tax-funded schools," Fritz contends, "whereas deferred gratification, usually based on hope and love, is the financing source of parent-funded schools."<p>

Fritz argues that government, as "the great enabler of irresponsibility and dependence," has created "an epidemic of parental irresponsibility." Nor will parents learn to be responsible again until they are forced to "pay the price of irresponsibility." Fritz argues that parent-funded schools succeed because they "have love as part of their culture; it starts with their financing. Tax-funded schools have coercion as part of their culture; it also starts with their financing. In education, like so much of life, love works. Coercion doesn't."<p>

While recognizing that "our forebears had the wisdom and courage to end government-compelled church funding, attendance, and practice," Marshall Fritz says we should go them one step better and prohibit government from "compelling school funding, attendance, and curriculum. Only with the separation of school and state," says Fritz, "can we re-establish parental responsibility, protect parents' rights, and enable schools, teachers, and students to flourish in an environment of educational freedom."<p>

 <i> September 9, 1996<p> 
 
<h2> Environmental Facts </h2><p>                           


<i>When it comes to environmentalism, the popular wisdom, more often than not, is wrong</i><p>



Pollution is a growing problem, right? Wrong! "The environment is cleaner than at any time in the past halfcentury," observes Joseph Bast of the Heartland Institute, co-author of a new book called Eco-Sanity, A CommonSense Guide to Environmentalism. "The average American [today] is exposed to fewer potentially harmful pollutants than at any time since the 1930s. Air and water pollution, which had risen during the 1940s and 1950s, have fallen consistently and considerably since that time. Today, pollution of all kinds is responsible for less than 1 percent of cancer deaths."<p>

Speaking of cancer, aren't cancer rates going up and up? Actually, they're not. "Cancer rates are falling, not rising," says Bast. "We've lived with pesticides, automobiles, and electromagnetic fields for nearly a century. During this period, overall cancer rates among the non-elderly population went down, not up. Cancer rates among the elderly appear to have increased, but this is due partly to better diagnosis and partly to the rapid decline of other causes of death."<p>

So, maybe we're healthier and we're living longer, but an environmental cataclysm is bound to occur eventually, right? Wrong again. "Predictions of impending global ecological disasters are untrue. There is no scientific validity to claims that acid rain, global warming, deforestation, or ozone depletion will cause global environmental disasters at any time in the future," says Bast. "Most environmental problems have been or are being solved. Automobile emissions, for example, have been reduced by 90 to 97 percent during the past twenty years. The threats of deforestation and resource depletion have been eliminated from the developed countries of the world, and remain problems only in Third World countries torn by civil war and acute poverty. Oil spills are less common and cause less ecological harm than in the past. Landfill technology has advanced 'dramatically' in the past decade."<p>

But aren't our resources running out? Won't we have to learn to live with less? No to both questions. "Innovation and the use of reason to solve problems, not any change in human nature or in the amount of natural resources, make us wealthier than our grandparents," says Bast. "The 'gloom and doom' school of thought within the environmental movement systematically overlooks the role of ideas in finding new resources, managing waste, and protecting human health and the environment. Their zero-sum solutions are unnecessary and often don't work."<p>

Prosperity is a mixed blessing, though, isn't it? Not at a 1. "Prosperity is good for the environment," says Joseph Bast. "The fear that prosperity leads to environmentat destruction saturates the literature of the environmental movement. But prosperity has made it possible for us to invest in parks and wildlife preserves, clean our air and water, and treat or store our wastes," says Bast. "Prosperity is not only compatible with a clean environment; it is environmental protection's necessary precondition."<p>

<title>Duplantier: Environmental Logic -- 9/10/96</title>

<b>Behind the Headlines</b><br> 
<i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.</i><br>

 <i> September 10, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2> Environmental Logic </h2><p>


<i>Protecting the- environment requires accurate information and sound reasoning When environmentalism degenerates into sentimentalism, it winds up doing more harm than good.</i><p>




Joseph Bast of the Heartland Institute charges that "the biggest barrier to improving environmental protection . . . is the environmental movement itself." Co-author of a new book called Eco-Sanity, A Common-Sense Guide to Environmentalism, Bast argues that "the lack of understanding and critical thinking on the part of most environmentalists has compromised the movement's ability to be an effective force for environmental protection. The popular wisdom on issue after issue," he contends, "bears little resemblance to what objective scientists have to say." As a result, "many environmentalists are wasting their energy -- and the dollars of consumers, businesses, and taxpayers -- fighting nonexistent problems or problems that already are being solved, while bigger problems go unnoticed."<p>

Bast offers a quick course in critical thinking. Lesson Number One: "Correlation is not causation," he says. "Just because two things happen at the same time doesn't mean one is causing the other. We need proof, including a reasonable theory showing the path by which one thing causes another to occur. Most environmental scares -including global warming, electromagnetic fields, and dioxin -- resulted when the correlation of two things was mistaken for causation."<p>

Lesson Number Two: "Not everything can be explained. The truth," says Bast, "is that the causes of most specific cases of cancer, miscarriage, and child deformity in the U.S. are unexplained." He points out that "the victims of these afflictions" are not necessarily "experts on the causes of their illnesses. A victim's guess is no more reliable, and may be less reliable, than the guesses of any other nonexpert."<p>

Lesson Number Three: "Trends can't predict the future. During the 1 970s, global temperatures fell several years in a row and [so-called] 'experts' . . . predicted a new ice age," recalls Bast. "During the 1980s, temperatures rose several years in a row and the 'experts' . . . predicted catastrophic global warming."<p>

Lesson Number Four: "We can never avoid risk completely. Everything we do carries with it some risk," says Bast. "There is no such thing as a product, decision, or action that carries no risk whatsoever. Keep in mind that the risks of drowning (16 in a million), or dying in an accident at home (90 in a million), or dying in an automobile accident (192 in a million) greatly exceed the alleged environmental risks being decried by some organizations."<p>

Last Lesson: "We have to make choices," says Joseph Bast, even when it comes to protecting the environment. "We have to choose among different ways to do it. We can't do everything, all at once, because trying to do so would be extremely wasteful, unnecessarily injure many people, and probably produce unintended consequences that harm the environment. Instead, we must apply the same prudence that we apply to other important parts of our lives. The importance of environmental issues doesn't somehow exempt them from this discipline. In fact, their importance makes careful planning and efficiency all the more necessary."<p>

<title>Duplantier: Environmental Science  -- 9/11/96</title> 
</head>

<b>Behind the Headlines</b><br> 
<i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.</i><br> 
<a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F. R. Duplantier</a><br> 
 <i> September 11 , 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2> Environmental Science </h2><p>

<i>Any environmentalist who rejects the scientific method, and the objective truth it leads to, obviously has some other agenda than protecting the environment.<i><p>


"Some environmental groups insist that, unless a substance or action can be 'proven to be harmless' to human health or the environment, it should be restricted or banned. This is an impossible standard to meet," says Joseph Bast of the Heartland Institute. "It is impossible to prove that something does not exist."<p>

This is but one of the many scientific lessons offered in a new book, co-authored by Bast, called Eco-Sanity, A Common-Sense Guide to Environmentalism. The nature of toxicity is another. "The dose makes the poison," says Bast. "Some chemicals can be highly toxic, so it is natural for us to be concerned about their possible effects on human health and the environment. But the real, as opposed to the hypothetical, threat posed by a substance depends on our exposure to the substance, or its dose. Many toxic substances, both man-made and natural, are present in the air, water, and our food, but they are present in such small amounts that only recently have we invented the tools needed to discover their presence. There is little convincing evidence that these substances pose any threat to human health at current levels of exposure."<p>

Extrapolating the results of an experiment from one specises to another may be ill-advised. "Mice are not little men," says Bast. "Experiments on laboratory animals are valuable ways of measuring a chemical's toxicity or its likely effects on wildlife. But such experiments fail to accurately assess human cancer risks. The enormous doses fed to laboratory animals cause tissue damage and stress, which can lead to tumors even if the substance being tested is not carcinogenic at normal doses. Animal tests also assume that mice and humans respond the same way to chemicals, even though mice sometimes respond to chemicals very differently than rats and guinea pigs."<p>

Risk is a relative -- not an either-or -- proposition. "Risks can be measured and ranked," says Bast. "Researchers can measure and compare the risks associated with different courses of action." Reasonable estimates can be used to "rank environmental problems according to how much risk they pose to the environment or our health. This, in turn, helps us prioritize problems and decide where our limited resources would be best spent."<p>

Bias can skew the results of any research effort. "Science is not immune to politics," says Bast. "Most scientific research taking place in American universities is subsidized by the government, which means it is influenced by politics. Some scientists have political beliefs or loyalties that influence their views, especially on subjects outside their area of technical training." A report issued by an independent scientist is "less likely to be politicized" than one issued by a government agency, Bast observes. Either one, however, should be subjected to peer review. Environmental research must not be exempted from rigorous scientific standards.<p>

 <i> September 12, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2> Environmental Economics </h2><p>


<i>The free market can protect the environment far better than any government can, so why not take advantage of it?<i><p>



People will take care of the environment voluntarily if they have sufficient incentive for doing so. Property rights provide that incentive. "A property rights strategy works through incentives; government intervention relies on commands," says Joseph Bast of the Heartland Institute, co-author of a new book called Eco-Sanity, A CommonSense Guide to Environmentalism. "Ownership leads to better stewardship. We tend to take better care of things we own than of things we only rent or borrow," says Bast. "Natural resources, therefore, are better cared for if they are owned by the people who use them." Not surprisingly, governments tend to prefer a coercive approach, which requires a monitoring system and "an apparatus to punish those who attempt to evade the commands."<p>

For governments, of course, coercion can be an end in itself. The sincere environmentalist, however, has no excuse for succumbing to the totalitarian temptation, once he realizes that compulsion is counterproductive. "Pollution problems occur where rights are not defined and enforced," says Bast. "When things are privately owned, the civil justice system keeps us from invading or damaging them. But, when they are owned in common . . . we are often driven by competition with others to exploit them quickly and with little regard for their future value. The result is often pollution, unsustainable rates of development, and endangerment of wildlife."<p>

The free exchange of the free market "can help solve environmental problems," says Bast. "Transferable property rights enable those who value a resource most highly to bid it away from those who value it less. Potential buyers -for example, nonprofit organizations and clubs devoted to conservation -- can use their property rights to purchase or lease land, reward good stewardship, or purchase covenants that restrict allowable uses of land. Such exchanges reveal the true cost of protecting the environment and ensure that this cost is shared by those who value the environment most."<p>

Because they do not operate according to free-market principles, governments inevitably harm the environment. "Government officials seeks to expand their budgets and authority by delivering short-term benefits to special interest groups," says Bast. "Because they do not own the resources they manage, these officials are unlikely to manage them for maximum asset value." Government' i monopoly status prevents it from comparing "its own efficiency to that of competing organizations. As a result, government agents cannot know how good a job they are doing -- or how much harm they are causing."<p>

The free market encourages efficiency, and that's good for the environment. ''Efficiency means producing the most output with the least input," says Joseph Bast. "Over time, a system that rewards efficiency will also tend to produce less pollution than one that tolerates inefficiency.'' Governments, on the other hand, are notoriously inefficient, and their inefficiency leads to waste and pollution. Environmentalists without hidden agendas should recognize the superiority of the free-market approach.<p>

<h2> Recycling </h2><p>



<i>There are more than 7000 curbside recycling programs in the United States, with more than 100 million Americans participating. Two questions need to be asked, however: Do these programs work? Are they cost-effective?</i><p>

"Americans seem to be having a love affair with recycling," observes writer Harvey Black in a recent issue of Environmental Health Perspectives. "No longer do people simply look for a refuse container to toss away a used soda can or plastic bottle. They search for the right recycling receptacle. All over the United States, when it's time to take out the garbage, millions of people take out carefully sorted bundles of newspapers and cardboard, bags of aluminum and steel cans, and plastic containers -- all destined for recycling."<p>

The question is, does all this extra effort make any sense? In his article, entitled "Rethinking Recycling," which was reprinted by the Heartland Institute as an antidote to Earth Day propaganda, Black reports that "a number of economists and policy analysts have questioned whether the benefits of recycling outweigh the ease of disposing of waste materials in landfills. Critics say that what seems at first to make a great deal of sense doesn't always stand up to a close examination. For instance, some critics argue that collection costs make recycling a bad bargain for many localities because the costs often exceed the prices that the recyclables bring on the open market. They also charge that operating additional trucks to pick up recyclables increases toxic diesel emissions, offsetting any environmental gains."<p>

Black notes that "forms of recycling have been in use in the United States for almost 100 years At the turn of the century," he observes, "waste paper and rags were used to make new paper when wood pulp was scarce or too expensive. Recycling scrap metal and other materials was an American institution during World War II. And deposits on glass soda bottles in the 1950s and 1960s encouraged people to recycle and reuse them."<p>

These traditional forms of recycling all made economic sense at the time. "When the modern version of recycling began," says Black, "its economics were disastrous in some cases." He explains that "the economics of recycling is a mosaic of issues including collection costs, market demand, landfill costs, and recycling infrastructure and technology. Determining whether recycling makes economic sense involves analyzing these components to see how they fit into the total picture."<p>

Such considerations "may seem complex," concedes Harvey Black, "but they are at least somewhat quantifiable. The health and environmental benefits of recycling -- including energy conservation, toxic emissions reductions, and preservation of resources -- are far more difficult to quantify. Health and environmental benefits are somewhat indirect and are valued differently from individual to individual. Still, advocates of recycling argue that the more intangible benefits offer the most compelling case for recycling." Could it be that they simply don't understand economics, or do they just prefer not to have their efforts measured by an objective standard?<p>

<h2>The Argument Against Gun Control</h2> </center><p>
  
America cannot remain the land of the free unless it continues to be the  
home of the brave. <p> 
 
  
Fueled by anti-gun hysteria, the drive to disarm America gathered  
momentum with the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther  
King Jr. in 1968, the year that saw passage of the Gun Control Act. It   
neared its logical conclusion in 1981 when the Village Board of Morton  
Grove, Illinois banned the possession of all handguns and attempted to  
compel local citizens to surrender their weapons to the police. But, in the  
following year, the pendulum began to swing back the other way. In 1982  
the city council of Kennesaw. Georgia voted unanimously to require the  
head of every household to own a gun and ammunition. That year the  
incidence of burglary went down 73 percent in Kennesaw. Meanwhile, it  
was going up in Morton Grove.  <p>
  
Whether their motivation is a sincere desire to reduce the incidence of  
homicide, or a determination to render patriotic Americans defenseless,  
advocates of gun control have trouble advancing credible arguments on  
its behalf, relying instead on emotional appeals and exploiting every gun- 
related tragedy. What else can they do when FBI statistics show that most  
of the states with the highest murder rates have extensive gun control.  
while most of the states with the lowest murder rates have little or no gun  
control?  <p>
  
The pragmatic argument against gun control is simply that it doesn't  
work. Indeed, it seems to encourage crime to the extent that the  
criminally inclined are emboldened by the powerlessness of potential  
victims. But there is an even stronger moral argument, which will be  
heard more and more frequently as Americans in increasing numbers  
express their disenchantment with dependency and seek to reestablish  
their self-respect.  <p>
  
It is the argument of a brave people whose descendants very nearly  
succumbed to cowardice. As incorporated into the Declaration of  
Independence. it expresses the once self-evident truths that all people   
have the right to live, to be free, and to act in their own best interests; that  
these fights are given to us by God. not by other men; that governments  
have no other purpose than to protect these rights; and that a people can  
at any time discharge a government whose protection has burgeoned into  
oppression.  <p>
  
The possession of rights presupposes not only the responsibility for their  
proper use, but also the power to preserve them. Given the obvious  
inability of government to protect the rights of all people at all times, and   
the obvious inability of an unarmed citizenry to protect itself against a  
government that enjoys a monopoly on the use of force, it is abundantly  
clear that a free people must be armed to remain free. Americans are   
beginning to understand again that independence is a right, and bravery  
the virtue that preserves it. It's a good thing, too, because America will  
remain the land of the free only as long as it is also the home of the   
brave.  <p>

<h2>Americorps: Voluntarism?</h2> <br></center>
 
When Congress tried to defund Americorps last year, Democrats accused  
Republicans of wanting to destroy "voluntarism." But what kind of  
voluntarism is it when the volunteer gets paid, and handsomely?  <p>
  
  
High school graduates who defer college for a year and enroll in  
Americorps instead "receive a healthy stipend and a $4,700 voucher for  
college education," reports Robert Sirico, president of the Acton Institute   
for the Study of Religion and Liberty, in a recent newspaper editorial. He  
cites an audit by the General Accounting Office that pegged the cost of  
the 20,000 Americorps "volunteers" at nearly $31.500 each, "which  
works out to be pretty good pay at taxpayers' expense."  <p>
  
Sirico suggests that "voluntarism" may not be the right word for such  
activity. "One view of voluntarism is that it is uncompensated labor," he  
observes. "People volunteer at a soup kitchen or in local service clubs.   
Well, by that definition, Americorps is not voluntary. Eliminate the  
incentives of the stipend and the education voucher and then we'll  
discover just how 'voluntary' the program is." <p> 
  
Sirico is willing to consider other definitions. He notes that voluntarism  
may be construed to mean "doing something because of benevolent  
personal desire," and concedes that Americorps workers may be   
motivated by good intentions. "But this does not set them apart from  
other workers." he insists. "Most entrepreneurs love their work. They also  
desire the happiness of others. They try to give people something they  
want, whether it is a good meal, quality clothing, sturdy housing, or  
reliable letter delivery. Somehow, though, capitalist acts are not supposed  
to qualify as 'voluntary' in this sense."  <p>
  
Suppose "voluntarism" simply means "anything that is not coerced." Still,  
we have a problem. "In a market economy, the jobs of just about  
everyone pass this test. No one is forced to take a job," says Sirico. "Most   
people face an array of alternatives of how to use their talents in the  
market." Sirico insists that "the very existence of our social safety net  
means workers in America volunteer to be responsible people, to earn a   
living by the sweat of their brows."  <p>
  
No, none of these definitions will do. "The only trait of Americorps that  
distinguishes it from charity, jobs, or entrepreneurship in the private  
sector," Sirico concludes, "is that it is sponsored and run by government.   
This seems to be the message of Americorps: You're not really working  
for the social good unless you are working under government guidance."  
Sirico finds this message disturbing. "It teaches young people a false  
notion about trade," he says, the notion being that "working for a  
business, for profit. is somehow ignoble." Americorps "forcibly siphons  
money from the public through taxation" and pays its volunteers "a   
hefty sum" while vaunting its moral superiority. <p> 
  
Sirico has some sage advice for the idealistic youth: "If serving others is  
what you desire, don't be bought off by a government program. Try  
something voluntary that is personally challenging, socially beneficial,   
and doesn't cost the taxpayers one dime."  <p>

<h2>Social Experimentation in Americas Armed Forces</h2> </center>
 
Here is a revolting irony for you: Daring young combat pilots feel more 
secure dodging anti-aircraft guns over enemy territory than they do when 
speaking their minds on American soil. <p>
 
 
The temperature can reach 125 degrees on the tarmac at Nellis Air Force 
Base in Nevada, reports Mindy Belz in a recent issue of World magazine. 
"Hotter still," she says, "is the situation of any officer who dares  
to question even in a private conversation, the Clinton administration's 
policies that are undermining the spirit of America's armed forces." Belz 
observes with dismay that the officers at the Air Force Weapons School 
"speak cautiously. even mechanically, about profound changes in the 
military" -- voicing pat approval for such controversial trends as women 
in combat, downsizing of the services, and murky missions under foreign 
command. When the men charged with defending our freedoms have to 
watch everything they say and be constantly on guard against betrayal, 
something is desperately wrong in America. <p>
 
It is true that soldiers must be trained not to question authority. "The 
militarys code of ethics -- taking orders -at its best preserves order and 
strength in the military," Belz concedes. "But the about-face of President 
Clinton (and President Bush before him) on fundamental issues -- such as 
keeping military policy insulated from the fluctuating pop-culture 
influences -- has trickled down without public debate." This is an  
unhealthy situation. It will lead to demoralization of the troops, their 
involvement in social experimentation. and reduced security for our 
country. "Stifling debate on matters that go to the heart of military 
readiness undermines the dutiful," Belz charges. "Political correctness 
turns loyalty into Newspeak." <p>
 
Orders may be orders, but every veteran can remember when giving and 
getting some guff was part of the equation. After all, the right to have his 
own opinion, the right to disagree, was partly what he fought for. Blind 
obedience went out with the Nuremberg trials. Or did it? Belz cites the 
case of Navy Lt. Commander Ken Carkhuff, a 17-year veteran who 
confided to his commanding officer that he had religious objections  
to women in combat. That comment led ultimately to a board of inquiry, 
which recommended separation from the service. Fortunately, public 
opinion persuaded the Secretary of the Navy to overrule the board and  
allow Carkhuff to remain. A high-ranking Air Force officer who prefers 
to remain nameless says that criticizing the concept of women in combat 
is "a career-ender." <p>
 
Belz points out that "the Senate continues to hold the power of conferring 
rank on all military officers,'' and that feminist senators "have attacked 
the retirement grade of three Navy admirals . . . who were accused of  
not promoting women." This is America? Men who spent their entire 
lives in service must now kowtow to these feminist bullies or risk 
jeopardizing the benefits they have earned. Can this be the country they  
fought for? <p>

<h2>The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty </h2></center>
 
The Clinton Administration claims to have abandoned the doctrine of  
Mutual Assured Destruction, but its interpretation of the Anti-Ballistic  
Missile Treaty with the former Soviet Union says otherwise. <p> 
  
  
"The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is at the heart of the debate on ballistic  
missile defense," say Kim Holmes and Baker Spring of the Heritage  
Foundation. "Whether to proceed more quickly or more slowly to deploy  
missile defenses, and in what way, or whether to proceed at all, is  
determined by how the ABM Treaty is viewed. The strategic assumptions  
underlying the treaty. forged during the Cold War, are very much alive in  
the Clinton Administration. They drive the Administrations approach not  
only to missile defense policy, but also to arms control and even U.S.  
policy toward Russia," Holmes and Baker charge.  <p>
  
The two defense analysts argue that the Clinton Administration's  
interpretation of the ABM Treaty is perpetuating America's vulnerability  
to ballistic missile attack. That interpretation reflects a willingness "to   
defend U.S. allies and forces overseas but leave American citizens and  
territory vulnerable to nuclear attack." Holmes and Baker contend that the  
Administration is "expanding the scope of the ABM Treaty to limit  
theater missile defenses, even though this was never intended b! the  
original architects of the Treaty."  <p>
  
The Clinton Administration calls the ABM Treaty "a cornerstone of  
strategic stability," but disavows the doctrine of Mutual Assured  
Destruction that underlies it. Holmes and Baker point out that "the basic   
assumption behind the ABM Treaty was that the ability of the Soviet  
Union . . . and the United States to destroy each other was the central  
factor in maintaining strategic stability. The ABM Treaty," they say,   
"was designed to ensure that this vulnerability continued." But, if Mutual  
Assured Destruction "is no longer the guiding principle of U.S. doctrine,  
then the ABM Treaty can no longer serve as a cornerstone of strategic  
stability."  <p>
  
The Treaty is not much of an incentive for arms control either. A strong  
U.S. strategic defense program is far more conducive to offensive  
reductions than the ABM Treaty ever was or ever will be," say Holmes   
and Baker. "During the 1980s progress toward offensive reductions  
occurred only after the U.S. made it clear to the Soviets that the Strategic  
Defense Initiative would proceed." Noting that "no major arms control  
agreement with the Russians has been initiated by the Clinton  
Administration. which has scaled back America's missile defense  
programs," the two analysts conclude that "the Russians are quicker to   
reach arms control agreements with the U.S when they face a determined  
U.S. missile defense program than when they face a weak one."  <p>
  
The doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction should be scrapped once and  
for all, say Holmes and Baker, and replaced with a policy that "seeks to  
prevent potentially hostile forces from obtaining missiles and weapons of  
mass destruction," deters the possessors of such weapons from using  
them, defends against missile attacks once they have begun, and allows  
for preemptive strikes against missile delivery systems.  <p>

<title>Ross Perot's Medicare Rx -- du Pont</title>
</head>

<center>
<i>Thursday, September 28, 1995</i><hr>
 
<h2>Ross Perot's Medicare Rx </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>
 

Ross Perot has a knack for identifying those issues that are important 
to voters.  Just a week after congressional leaders said that Medicare 
reform would be the biggest policy issue this fall, his book on 
Medicare hit the stands.  Intensive Care is a book about the crisis 
facing Medicare and Medicaid, the federal and federal/state health 
insurance programs for the elderly and poor.   <p>
 
 Medicare and Medicaid have evolved into enormous, wasteful and 
inefficient government programs that must be reformed before they 
financially break the country.   How big is the problem?  Mr. Perot 
points out that Medicare and Medicaid will take up 17.4 percent of the 
federal budget in 1995, or about 35 percent of all entitlement 
spending.  According to Medicare's board of trustees, without 
fundamental change the program will go bankrupt by 2002.   <p>
 
Something has to be done, and it has to be done soon.  But as Mr. 
Perot points out, historically Congress has been reluctant to resolve 
the federal government's penchant for excessive spending.  "Our 
elected leaders have ignored the clear signals that the greatest 
nation in the history of man has been spending itself toward 
bankruptcy."  <p>
 
Medicare is probably the only large health insurance plan in the 
country that has not undergone fundamental change over the past 
decade.  Many employers have increased deductibles and copayments - 
requiring employees to manage more of their own health care dollars.  
More frequently, employers have begun directing their employees to 
lower-cost doctors and actively managing health care costs.   <p>
 
Medicare has moved in the opposite direction.  In recent years the 
deductible for Part A (hospital insurance) has not changed in real 
terms, and the deductible for Part B (other medical expenses) has 
actually decreased in real terms.  While there has been some 
experimentation with managed care, in most places Medicare is still a 
wide-open, fee-for-service plan in which patients can see almost any 
doctor for any service.   
 
Reforming Medicare and Medicaid and balancing the federal budget will 
force us to make some tough choices, and when there are tough choices 
to be made Ross Perot hears his entry cue.  He believes that "we 
should view the coming debate over Medicare and Medicaid as an 
opportunity rather than a dilemma."  It's an "opportunity for creative 
minds to update old systems that have served their purpose, but are 
now in need of an overhaul to function properly in the next century." <p>
 
What direction should reform take?  "A properly designed system based 
on market principles will do more to initiate positive change than any 
government rules and regulations that attempt to monitor the profits 
of the health care industry," Mr. Perot tells us.  <p>
 
As mentioned earlier, many employers are actively managing their 
employees' health care costs or are moving them into managed care 
plans.  Mr. Perot discusses this solution and points out that Congress 
is already moving in this direction for Medicare.  Current law allows 
some Medicare beneficiaries to withdraw from Medicare and join a 
health maintenance organization (HMO) instead.  While seniors should 
be free to remain in Medicare, we should build on this precedent and 
allow Medicare beneficiaries to withdraw from Medicare Parts A and B 
and choose any alternative private plan.   <p>
 
Perhaps a more attractive option than managed care is also discussed 
by Mr. Perot:  Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs). This option would 
permit Medicare recipients to use their Medicare funds to purchase a 
catastrophic policy coupled with a Medical Savings Account.  For 
example, private insurance might cover all health expenses over a 
$3,000 deductible, and place any premium savings in an MSA.  MSA funds 
would then be used to pay for expenses below $3,000.  In case a gap 
remained between the MSA deposit and the catastrophic deductible, 
retirees could top up their MSA by contributing amounts they otherwise 
would have used to purchase private, Medigap insurance or pay out-of-
pocket expenses.  <p>
 
Of course, to hear Democrats and liberals complain about MSAs, you'd 
think it was positively un-American to let people keep some of the 
money they are now giving to insurance companies.  It's that same 
mentality we've seen from Washington for years: "Heaven help us if we 
let taxpayers keep some of their own money.  They might not spend it 
like we bureaucrats would like." <p>
 
Ross Perot has always believed in the ability of the American people 
to respond properly when adequately informed - and that's what this 
book is meant to do.   While his book will not be the last word on 
Medicare, Intensive Care has succeeded as a sound analytical 
beginning. <p>

<h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES</h4>  
 <i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.  <br>
 F.R. Duplantier <br>
 September 29, 1995  <br>
  </i><hr>

<h2>Educators Attack Family Values  </h2></center>
 
An education expert says that "challenges from conservative citizen  
groups objecting to particular instructional strategies and materials" are  
hampering efforts "to make fundamental changes in public schooling "  <p>
  
  
Writing in the September 1993 issue of Phi Delta Kappan, Indiana  
University professor of education Martha McCarthy tipped off her  
colleagues to a new trend in parental protests against teaching materials.   
"Until the late 1970s the targets were usually individual books," she  
observed. "While the list of individual books under attack continues to  
grow. recent protests -- often orchestrated by national conservative  
groups -- are more likely to focus on entire textbook series and  
components of the instructional program." <p> 
  
That means that pet theories and vested interests are at stake. Take, for  
instance the Whole Language approach to reading. McCarthy noted that  
"the most widely challenged textbook series" at that time was Harcourt  
Brace Jovanovich's 10-volume anthology Impressions, which uses the  
Whole language method. "Most of the challenges focus on the series'  
subject matter rather than on its pedagogical approach," she conceded.  
"but the controversy associated with Impressions may have implications  
for the future of Whole-Language instruction."  <p>
  
McCarthy reported that conservatives have also attacked the Quest  
curriculum for teaching relativism and disrespect for parental authority,  
the Tactics for Thinking program for teaching New Age beliefs, and   
Outcome Based Education for teaching hardly anything. She noted that  
"instruction pertaining to values clarification, self-esteem, multicultural  
education, evolution, AIDS education, and global education are being  
contested as anti-Christian, anti-American, or other vise inappropriate."  
But the meddling doesn't stop there, McCarthy continued. "Several  
instructional strategies currently touted in the education literature, such as  
collaborative learning and thematic instruction, are being challenged  
because they shift to students some of the responsibility that was formerly  
lodged with the teacher."<p>  
  
Such challenges, McCarthy warned her peers, "call into question some of  
the basic assumptions of school restructuring initiatives," thereby posing  
"far more serious threats to efforts to improve the public school program  
than do challenges to individual novels." What's more, she added, "the  
success rate of those initiating challenges has been rising." Even  
unsuccessful challenges sometimes delay construction of educational  
utopias, "for the controversy itself can disrupt school operations and  
interfere with implementation of the program." Then there's the dreaded  
ripple effect: "When materials or programs are attacked in one school  
district, the controversy often affects other districts."  <p>
  
In a fit of candor, McCarthy advised her colleagues to drop their pretense  
of impartiality and give up trying to appease parents. "Instead of arguing  
that the challenged instructional programs are value-neutral or trying to  
sanitize the curriculum so that no groups are offended, policymakers and  
educators need to take a stand," exhorted McCarthy. She thus confirmed  
what many conservative parents have suspected all along: that educators  
are fighting an undeclared war against families with traditional values.  
We should thank Martha McCarthy for letting parents know what they're  
up against.  <p>

<h3>HUD:  BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD</h3>

By <br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz </a><p>
<hr></center>
It is heartening to hear Congress is considering the elimination of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  It is heartening to see that someone in Washington has figured out that 
Washington does not have all the answers and it is time to try something else.<p> 
HUD was created in 1965 out of several federal agencies concerned with housing, mortgage finance and urban issues.  HUD was formed to address an emerging urban crisis and a growing underclass, subject to squalid housing conditions, crime, unemployment, eroding families and limited educational achievement.<p>   
As originally conceived, HUD was an integral part of the "War on Poverty," which to date has cost $5 trillion.  Our urban problems have not markedly improved during the 30-year war, and many would argue that conditions have grown worse.  Life in the roughest parts of our cities is similar to Hobbes' state of nature:  nasty, brutish and short!  <p> 
Since the $8 billion HUD scandal in 1989, the words "financial mismanagement" and HUD have become synonymous.  In 1984, the Grace Commission warned of financial disasters stemming from HUD's fundamental flaw.  According to the Grace Commission, HUD is "a financial institution with a social mission," and the emphasis on its social goals "resulted in a higher priority on program execution at the expense of the internal management requirements normally associated with a financial institution."  Sound financial management is secondary to spending. <p>   
Since 1990, HUD has been featured prominently in the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) "high risk" program, which lists by department the federal government's fundamental financial management weaknesses.  HUD's financial management systems for monitoring low-income housing assistance are so bad that HUD cannot assure taxpayers that their taxes are used for eligible recipients, or that there is adequate fund control for more than $100 billion in long-term contractual funding serving 3 million families.  The Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) insurance fund for single family housing loans may not be sufficient to cover losses.  Currently, FHA has in force $303 billion of insurance, but it may not be able to pay potential claims without seeking higher appropriations from Congress.  Also cited are 106 Public Housing Authorities (PHA), accounting for 17 percent of all PHA housing units, which have been identified as troubled.  Taxpayers cannot be "assured that public housing funds achieve intended purposes."  PHAs administer more than half of HUD's budget.   <p>
Not only is HUD wasteful and ineffective, it is a financial liability.  Any private corporation in the position of the federal government would have done something about the department long ago.<p> 
HUD's failure to resolve its 30-year internal conflict between its role as a financial institution and its social goals has prompted freshmen House Republicans, led by Representatives Sam Brownback (R-
Kan.) and Sue Myrick (R-N.C.), and a Senate task force, chaired by Senators Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.) and Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.), to recommend HUD's elimination. <p>  
The recently released House bill, known as "The Federal Housing Reform and Local Empowerment Act," proposes to replace the existing public housing and housing assistance with a voucher program to be administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  Under the proposal, state governments are given the options of participating in the HHS program, running their own voucher program, or setting up their own public housing program.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this would save $17 billion in budget authority over five years. <p>
The bill also consolidates many of HUD's programs into two block grant programs:  the Housing and Development Block Grant and the Special Populations Block Grant, both of which will be administered by HHS.  Other programs will either be eliminated, transferred to other government agencies, or privatized. <p>
Earlier this year, the Administration recognized that something had to be done to save HUD from the scalpels of Republican budget hawks.  As part of the vice president's reinvention program, HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros laid out the administration's strategy for saving the department.  Cisneros proposed consolidating 60 HUD programs into three community and housing funds, creating a voucher system for public housing, and converting FHA into a government-owned corporation 
to reduce costs.  According to OMB, the administration's proposal would save $770 million over five years.  That's less than five percent of the savings from the congressional reform bill. <p>
The "reinvention strategy," which has become a trademark of the Clinton administration, is an attempt to protect favorite programs and departments from budget cuts and taxpayer criticism, under the guise 
of improving the federal bureaucracy.  For the Clinton administration, reinvention substitutes for true reform.  More often than not, the rhetoric of reinvention has become an argument for the status quo and 
an assurance to special interests that business-as-usual can continue.<p>     
This rearguard action was recently rejected by former HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, who said that the "American people do not want to reinvent government, they want to reduce it."  He added that taxpayers, "[D]on't want to manage the bureaucracy better, they want to shrink the bureaucracy.  And they don't want people dependent upon government, they want people empowered." <p>
HUD has had its 30-year trial run.   It failed.   It's time to downsize, devolve, privatize and terminate HUD.

<b>President, Citizens Against Government Waste By:  Thomas A. Schatz</b>
<p> 
Much of the nation has been under the oppressive grip of a heat wave with temperatures exceeding 100 degrees.  These sweltering days of summer are no match for the oppressive burden of federal regulations that have gripped the nation for years.  Come October, the cool fall air will replace the stagnant heat, but unnecessary and ridiculous federal regulations will continue to cost American taxpayers nearly $600 billion per year. 
<p>
In its unrelenting leadership role, the House of Representatives is actively trying to get rid of burdensome regulations and return the nation to common sense and fiscal freedom.  The Regulatory Reform Bill, which was signed on February 24, 1995, allows property owners to seek compensation when a federal regulatory action has taken place and improves the process by which federal regulations are developed and 
issued.   
<p>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) again took on ridiculous regulations when he proposed "Corrections Days" earlier this year.  Corrections Days, which passed with a vote of 271 to 146 on June 20, 1995, is a mechanism to streamline the termination of silly regulations.  The House will be holding corrections days twice a month.  Among the many targets for corrections is the repeal of a provision that places costly safety requirements on ships carrying vegetable oil into or out of U.S. waters, even though the oil, if spilled, poses no threat to the environment or public health; and a federal rule barring the removal of trees surrounding an airport for safety purposes if those trees are in a wetland. 
<p>
In its first session of corrections on July 25, 1995, the House voted 269 to 156 to exempt San Diego, California from a water pollution regulation that would require the city to build a $2 billion sewage treatment plant.  Critics of the plant contend that discharging sewage into the Pacific Ocean four miles offshore would not affect sea-life 
and in some instances would benefit marine life.  This is an important first step in trying to bring the federal regulation leviathan under control.   
<p>
As the House catapults ahead with serious regulatory reform, the Senate has once again lagged behind.  Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kansas) set aside the GOP-sponsored regulatory reform bill on July 18, 1995, because of lack of support.  Senator Dole is unsure when and if the bill will ever come up for consideration in the 
Senate.  The Senate is too timid to attack the voracious appetite of federal regulations. 
<p>
Regulation reform is not an esoteric or vague concept.  Regulations affect everybody.  Government regulation dramatically increases the cost of doing business, which results in fewer jobs and lower salaries, and makes U.S. companies less competitive. 
<p>
Regulations extend their claws into all sectors of society including food and medicine, the environment, and the Department of the Interior (DOI). 
<p>
Probably the most powerful regulatory agency in the entire federal government is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).   The expansion of the FDA is unparalleled in the federal government.  Growing from 4,470 employees in 1970, with a budget of $227 million, the FDA currently has 9,217 employees at a cost of $764 million.  This is a 106-percent increase in employees and a 237- percent increase in budget.  The FDA approves more regulations rather than drugs.  Drug approval averages 12 years and $359 million per drug.  The cost of this excessive regulation is passed on to the consumer at approximately 25 cents per dollar.  Critically needed drugs are delayed incessantly because of excessive regulations. 
<p>
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is notorious for its overzealousness in regulating.  Initially established in 1970 to combat a real and growing pollution problem, the EPA has turned into a monolithic regulating monster.  Evidence of such heavy-handed regulations include a Pennsylvania couple being threatened with 
polluting a waterway by installing a tennis court on their land; a couple in New York being fined $30,000 for building a deck on their house because, among other things, it cast a shadow on a wetland;  and an auto parts store owner being fined $10,000 because he didn't post a sign, which was down because of window washing, stating that his store accepts waste motor oil for recycling.  Micro- managing the 
environment instead of fighting pollution is the new mission of the EPA. 
<p>
DOI weighs in with its own stupid and environmentally unsound practice of micro management.  The Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the National Biological Survey (NBS) are examples of the DOI's misguided policies.  The ESA causes hardships for private property owners, businesses, and developers; it confers enormous power on unaccountable bureaucrats; and is costly to U.S taxpayers.   
<p>
The ESA has listed 853 species to be protected, while some 4,000 other plants and animals are official candidates for future listings.  According to Maura Dolans of the Los Angeles Times, blunders by the Fish and Wildlife Service may have contributed to an extinction.  The Service spent nearly $3 million  to buy a Florida habitat for the endangered dusky seaside sparrow -- and then neglected to manage the land properly.  The last bird died in 1987. 
<p>
The NBS was created to catalogue everything that walks, crawls, swims or flies around this country on public or private lands.  Critics say that the program will take years to complete, involve thousands of government scientists, and would clash with private property rights.  Because an area was designated under the NBS as a wilderness area, a lost Boy Scout was not rescued in a timely manner.  A rescue 
helicopter was not allowed to land in a sensitive area.  A note had to be dropped to the child.  The Boy Scout was eventually rescued by a second helicopter when the search party failed to find him. 
<p>
Needless regulations are shortsighted and stupid.  Some may seem humorous, but all are serious.  The increased presence of federal regulations erode away personal freedoms as well as our bank accounts.  The federal government should be for the people not against the people. 
<p>
Yes, I want to join the more than 600,000 members of CAGW to fight Washington's wasteful ways.  I understand that $1.00 of my contribution entitles me to four issues of Government WasteWatch.

<h2>Tales From the Gypped</h2>


By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><p>
</center><hr>
<br>
Medicare reform will be among Congress' top priorities after the  
August recess.  Those who are fighting any reform, their message is  
that each dollar spent in the program produces a dollar in benefits  
for America's seniors.  Nothing could be further from the truth. <p> 
The Medicare program is a sitting duck for con artists, thieves, and  
degreed opportunists.   Because of its size, diabolical complexity and  
lax management practices, this $177 billion leviathan has become the  
equivalent of a Gucci-clad matron sauntering down the street sporting  
a flashing neon sign that says "please rob me!"  Those with a notion  
to defraud Medicare know that these three factors alone guarantee that  
the risks of gaming the system are worth taking because Medicare is  
where the easy money is.<p>
In fiscal year 1993, Medicare processed almost 700 million claims.   
That's nearly 2 million per day, about 250 million more than it  
processed five years earlier, and nearly six times the number of tax  
returns processed by the Internal Revenue Service.  Physicians, supply  
companies, or diagnostic laboratories have about three chances out of  
1,000 of having Medicare audit their billing practices in any given  
year.<p>
Medicare fraud is perpetrated by billing companies, providers,  
suppliers, even organized crime and drug dealers.  There are scams  
involving kickbacks, durable medical equipment, prescription  
marketing, nursing homes and home care providers, tampered medical  
supplies, ambulance and taxi services.  Medicare fraud is as varied as  
the imaginations of the criminals who game the system.  Citizens  
Against Government Waste's (CAGW) new report, Medicare Fraud: Tales  
from the Gypped, details more than one hundred examples.<p>  
Unless you've been away on the space shuttle, you surely are aware of  
the litany of waste that plagues the program.  But individual examples  
don't give the full picture.  It is heart-stopping.   At least ten  
percent, or $17 billion each year, in Medicare spending is irrevocably  
squandered.  That 10 percent is also, coincidentally, the annual  
growth rate that is leading the program to bankruptcy over the next  
several years.<p>  
Here are just a few of the countless examples:<p>     
** Several Michigan pharmacists obtained large supplies of expired  
drugs and dispensed them to nursing home patients, at full cost to  
Medicare.  One of the pharmacists who participated in the scheme  
quipped, "those people are old, they'll never know the difference, and  
they'll be dead soon anyway." <p> 
** A pharmaceutical salesman peddled $6 million in expired,  
mislabeled, unsterile, or second-hand pacemakers over an eight-year  
period, sometimes providing Hawaiian vacations or prostitutes as  
kickbacks to cardiologists who agreed to implant the adulterated  
devices in unsuspecting patients.  In his offices, authorities found  
"a number of bloody pacemakers, raising suspicions he was reselling  
devices surgically removed from other patients or even from corpses." <p> 
** In Florida, more than a dozen companies, claiming to supply  
Medicare patients with liquid nutritional supplements and feeding  
kits, defrauded Medicare of an estimated $20 million.  The "kingpin"  
of the scheme fled the country, but was found in Venezuela and  
extradited. <p> 
** A company in New York lured Medicare beneficiaries into disclosing  
their Medicare identification numbers in exchange for microwave ovens,  
air conditioners, or angora underwear.   <p>
** A Georgia health-care company is under investigation for allegedly  
pocketing more than $14 million in illegally obtained Medicare funds.   
Money allegedly went toward golf-course memberships, vacations, a new  
car for the CEO's son, $9.7 million for computer software, $84,341 for  
gourmet popcorn, and $18,600 for lobbying activities.  <p>
** A California supply company billed Medicare for $5 million worth of  
surgical dressings for patients who never underwent surgery. <p> 
There is no doubt that Medicare is in crisis.  We've heard from  
Medicare's Public Trustees that the program is faltering.  This year,  
the trustees have given us a date certain for Medicare's impending  
demise if its current rate of spending is not reduced: 2002.  They've  
told us that if we don't act today, never mind the long-range affect  
on baby boomers and their children, our parents and grandparents, who  
currently receive benefits, will be cut off in just seven years. <p>   
Rhetoric and denial are the postures of choice in Washington.  Some  
members of Congress, along with their outside supporters, claim there  
is no crisis.  Others argue that the federal government will never let  
the system run out of money, as if the American taxpayer is a never- 
ending source of cash for this out-of-control program.  And then there  
are those, like Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.), who can't  
resist the easy politics of intergenerational fear-mongering.    <p>
But Republican attention to Medicare's problems are not some partisan  
plot.  Mr. Gephardt ought to familiarize himself with the authors of  
the 1995 Trustees Report, which included such Republican "friends" as  
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Labor Secretary Robert Reich, Health  
and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, and Social Security  
Commissioner Shirley Chater.  <p>
If Medicare's centralized, non-competitive, single-payer system is at  
the heart of billions of dollars in wasted resources, eliminating  
waste and fraud requires that competitive, market forces be introduced  
into the Medicare system.  Free market forces and incentives would  
reduce Medicare's excessive costs and improve the quality of health  
care available for seniors.  By putting the onus for rooting out fraud  
and abuse on the private sector, and creating inescapable incentives  
to do so, risk-free opportunities to defraud the system would be  
greatly reduced.  Moreover, we would finally provide seniors with a  
medical system that develops greater quality rather than one that  
simply increasingly consumes more and more health dollars.  <p>
How we deal with Medicare's crisis will speak volumes about who we are  
as Americans and what kind of society we value.  At stake is whether  
today's senior citizens, not to mention those of us who are following  
close behind, will have a viable health-care system in the future.   
Waste and fraud will only rob us all of a better future if we continue  
to assume it is an unavoidable result of a well-meaning big government  
program.<p>

<title>Gary Bauer's January, 1997 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

January 3, 1997

<p>

Dear Friend,

<p>

On January 22, our nation will mark the 24th anniversary of the
Supreme Court decisions that elevated a choice for death to the
level of national policy.  In <I>Roe v. Wade</I> and its companion
case, <I>Doe v. Bolton</I>, seven men dressed in black robes delivered
a cruel blow that continues to reverberate throughout our land.
Those seven Justices, arrogant and unelected, elevated abortion
on demand to a status of grand Constitutional privilege.  The
chilling effects of their ruling have not stopped even to this
day, as a culture of death continues to descend across this good
and decent land.

<p>

Just how deeply a nation can sink into a depraved indifference
to human life was vividly illustrated recently in Delaware.  There,
prosecutors charge, two unwed college students -- Brian Peterson,
Jr. and Amy Grossberg -- entered a hotel for the express purpose
of giving birth to their firstborn son.  What happened next, prosecutors
say, is horrible to contemplate.  On a cold November night, the
child was placed in a plastic bag and dropped outside in the hotel
dumpster, where maintenance workers later found his body.  The
dead baby had a fractured skull and other injuries that the coroner
attributes to blunt-force head trauma and shaking.

<p>

Reaction to this case has been extraordinary.  Many columnists
have noted the fact that Brian Peterson and Amy Grossberg are
among those society would call its &quot;fortunate souls.&quot;
They come from well-to-do families; they have had the best of
everything.  As the <I>New York Times</I> reported it, they &quot;grew
up where many teenagers have their own cars and secure futures,
where gardeners tend landscaped lawns and shrubs[.]&quot;[1] They
do not live in some remote, forsaken corner of the world, or in
a culture where out-of-wedlock childbearing is rare or scorned.
They come from prosperous families in a populous state (New Jersey),
at a time when unwed pregnancy is so common that, apparently,
no one at Amy Grossberg's college even discussed with her the
fact that she was clearly on the verge of childbirth.

<p>

These young people are entitled to the legal presumption of innocence,
of course, so we will withhold our judgment about what happened
in that hotel room.  But we don't have to wait to react to what
is being said about their case by the swarms of psychologists
and lawyers now descending on Delaware.  Getting at the truth
seems far down on the list of priorities for these apologists.
One commentator regretted that Peterson and Grossberg had not
gone to New Jersey's local Planned Parenthood, where their problem
could have been averted by the nation's largest abortion provider.
New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who has led the fight
to remove the pro-life plank from the Republican platform, talked
vaguely about the couple's failure to consider adoption and &quot;other
options.&quot;  Charles Oberly, Amy Grossberg's attorney, with
no hint that he was merely trying to shift the blame to Peterson,
told <I>The New York Times</I> that &quot;[t]here is a serious
question whether this woman did anything criminal.&quot;[2]

<p>

Now, it may be true that both of these privileged young adults
are &quot;all-American kids.&quot;  It may be, as their lawyer
claims, that they were panic-stricken and irrational to the point
of insanity in that hotel room.  But it might also be the case
that they engaged in an act of calculated rationality.  Columnist
George Will put his finger on this exactly when he pointed out
how, under only slightly different circumstances, Peterson and
Grossberg could have found themselves visiting the White House
for a veto ceremony instead of standing before a grand jury in
Delaware. &quot;Don't young people read newspapers?&quot; he
wrote. &quot;Don't they know that, thanks to President Clinton,
they could have <I>chosen</I> to have a doctor suck their baby's
brains out, and Delaware would not have <I>chosen</I> to charge
them with murder?&quot;[3]

<p>

In the world in which we now live, it is surely possible that
two 18-year-olds could not see the logical and rational difference
between dropping their baby boy into a dumpster and dropping by
the New Jersey clinic that has performed 1,500 partial-birth abortions
in a single year.  And if there is no rational difference between
these two actions, why then would society insist on punishment
for the one deed and presidential praise for the right to do the
other?

<p>

This is where the abortion culture has led us in January 1997.
On the 8th of this month, the Supreme Court of the United States
will hear a case that will determine whether or not there is an
individual constitutional right to commit suicide with the aid
of another.  Lawyers for our side, including FRC's own Cathy Cleaver,
have argued strenuously in legal briefs to the court not only
that no such right exists, but that to invent it would be to open
the floodgates to the wholesale &quot;termination&quot; of the
elderly and severely handicapped.  We have many allies on this
issue -- and compelling arguments -- but at this writing we are
keenly aware that the odds are against us: the Supreme Court is
radically liberal on social issues, and both federal appeals courts
in this case have held that the states may not restrict assisted
suicide.

<p>

In Michigan, Jack Kevorkian has claimed at least 45 victims. 
This pathological ex-pathologist, whose obsession with death includes
painting pictures that feature Nazi images and human cannibalism,
has so far evaded the condemnation of jurors.  The media depicts
him as a hero and trail-blazer.  He depicts himself as a latter-day
Thomas Jefferson, while conveniently forgetting all the while
the words of Jefferson, who said that &quot;[t]he care of human
life and happiness, and not their destruction, is the sole legitimate
object of good government.&quot;

<p>

How then can we restore respect for the sanctity of human life?
The Family Research Council is determined to do its part.  We
will continue to battle in the courts, as we have done in opposing
assisted suicide and defending the right of pro-life sidewalk
counselors to offer aid to those entering abortion clinics.[4] We
will continue to address our case to the Congress, urging the
adoption of legislation to ban partial-birth abortions and to
provide legal protection for human life from conception until
natural death.  And we will keep the pressure on Bill Clinton
and Al Gore to reverse their pro-abortion policies.  As long as
we have breath in us to speak, we will remind those in office
of their sacred duty to defend the weak and the helpless.

<p>

We will also continue to conduct research and to publish analysis,
both legal and social, of the key issues under debate.  This month,
we are releasing two more contributions to this effort.  Gracie
Hsu and Robert G. Morrison of my staff have joined with me in
preparing a comprehensive statement on the sanctity of human life.
We approached this task humbly, knowing that many great writers
and thinkers have addressed this subject more powerfully than
we ever could.  Still, we believe that Americans need a constant
recalling to the faith and vision of our founders and to the lessons
of our Judeo-Christian heritage.

<p>

It has been said over and over again that the abortion industry
is the most unregulated commercial enterprise in American history.
When a New Jersey newspaper revealed, as noted above, that a
clinic there had performed 1,500 partial-birth abortions in a
single year, it reported a startling fact that no power in state
government knew or wanted to know.  The information currently
being gathered about the number of abortions performed in America
and the harm these abortions do to women is woefully inadequate.
You can use the enclosed reply card to obtain a copy of FRC's
Special Report, <I>A Woman's Right (Not) to Know</I>, by Virginia
Delegate Robert G. Marshall.

<p>

January, of course, also marks the birthday of the Rev. Martin
Luther King, Jr.  His speech at the Lincoln Memorial still resonates
throughout every corner of this land, too, because he invoked
the &quot;unalienable rights&quot; to life, liberty and happiness
that belong to all people not by virtue of their skin color or
utility, but by virtue of their humanity.  That humanity is holy
because it reflects the image and likeness of our Creator, a Creator
who loves us &quot;irrationally&quot; -- not according to our
merits or usefulness to Him -- but because he has <I>chosen</I>
to love us.

<p>

How like that love the noblest human love is.  I think of the
woman in our area of Virginia a few years back, who came home
to find her family's trailer ablaze.  Knowing that her two children
were inside, she rushed into the inferno to save them.  A firefighter
who tried to restrain her said that she was on fire the moment
she passed through the trailer door.  Her body was found outside
the room where the bodies of her two sons lay. <I>Irrational love.</I>

<p>

Or the heartrending footnote to that searing story of the young
boy in the Chicago housing project who was thrown to his death
from an upper floor by two 12-year-olds because he refused to
steal candy for them.  That act of gross disrespect for human
life was matched by the impossible act of love displayed by the
dead boy's 5-year-old brother, who raced down the stairs of the
high rise immediately after the incident.  Asked by a counselor
what was going through his mind, the little boy said he had hoped
to catch his brother before he hit the ground.  <I>Irrational
love.</I>

<p>

Or, finally, the young police officer in Tennessee, struck by
a bullet in the line of duty, who lay in a &quot;persistent vegetative
state.&quot;  (That's an awful term for a physical condition that
none of us can fully comprehend.)  One day, after several years
of this coma-like condition, the officer awoke for a brief time,
recognized his children, and spoke to them.  His brother rushed
to the hospital to be with him.  When the press asked the brother
what his reaction was to so many years of waiting and worrying,
he said that it was worth it all just to be able to tell his brother
that he loved him, and to be understood.

<p>

My friends, these are acts of irrational love -- performed out
of profound, reflexive respect for the sanctity of human life.
All around us in 1997, there are signs that affirm this kind
of love, but unfortunately there are also many other signs that
tell us we have lost our way -- a way of service and sacrifice
on behalf of those who desperately need us.

<p>

In the days to come, let us all pray that our Supreme Court, our
Congress and our President will recover their sense of direction
and help this nation, once again, become a beacon to the oppressed,
a Shining City on a Hill.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S.  As always, your partnership with us is essential to our
success.  We thank God for all you do to make our work possible.
Your generosity and your prayers, your friendship and notes of
encouragement -- these things mean more to me that you will ever
know. I pray that you and your family will enjoy all of God's blessings
in 1997.

THOUGHTS FROM THE BUSINESS WORLD ON DOWNSIZING GOVERNMENT
<P>

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the Committee.  I was pleased to accept your invitation to discuss some corporate approaches to organization and downsizing and their possible relevance to the federal government.  I believe I do have a somewhat unusual perspective on this issue, having spent roughly 20 years in the corporate world.
<P>
I am pleased to be back in these chambers.  As a young member of the Congress during the 1960s, I had the opportunity to serve on this Committee when it was known as the Government Operations Committee.  At the beginning of my tenure, the government we oversaw was much smaller and simpler than the complex and overwhelming behemoth that so many of you in this Congress have pledged to reform.
<P>
With your permission, I thought what I would do this afternoon would be to merely summarize some of the concepts in my prepared text, which all of you have received in advance, and then allow the maximum amount of time for questions.
<P>
If my memory serves me correctly, one of the issues of my time in Congress was whether or not to close a dairy at the U.S. Naval Academy.  That example may be good for a laugh today, but those who tried to sell off the dairy were accused of not understanding the importance of a captive milk supply for the Midshipmen.  Heaven forbid that the Naval Academy would have to buy milk from the private sector like everyone else.
<P>
While that may seem like a trivial example compared with the sacred cows that must be challenged today if you are to balance the budget by 2002, the fact remains that the federal government is one of the few institutions that still thinks itself able to afford the luxury of sentimentality at taxpayers' expense.  Businesses eventually cannot afford to hold on to activities, people, practices, divisions or subsidiaries that have become not central to the core business, outmoded, inefficient or a financial drain on the rest of the company.  Rather, they have to figure out what they should and should not be doing and then take decisive action to get their financial affairs in order.  If they fail to do so, they die.
<P>
When taking over a troubled company, a knowledgeable CEO checks his or her "teeth to tail" ratio, as they say in the military.  It involves undertaking a thorough review of the company's assets and resources and then promptly divesting those that are not central to the future success of the institution.  This forces the company to focus on its "core" business and to avoid wasting manpower, time and money on ventures that are secondary to what is vital to the long-term health and success of the company.
<P>
A good example of a corporation recently undergoing such a top-to-bottom restructuring is Sears, Roebuck and Company.  Sears in recent years decided to move from a widely diversified company to a company focused on its core businesses.  During this restructuring it closed a hundred unprofitable stores, took Dean-Witter, Discover, Allstate Corporation, PMI, and S.P.S. public, sold off unneeded assets and even disposed of the famed Sear Tower in Chicago.  Some of the cash raised from these sales was used to buy out thousands of middle managers, and the rest was plowed back in to strengthen its basic businesses.
<P>
One of the most painful and visible aspects of their restructuring was the decision to close Sears' catalog division--the business on which Sears was built.  The truth is that the catalog division was unprofitable and a drain on the company's main businesses.  As difficult as it was, however, this break with the past told Sears stockholders that management was serious about fundamentally restructuring the company and putting it on a path for growth.
<P>
The experience at Sears, and the experiences at hundreds of other companies, including two I helped to downsize--G.D. Searle & Co., a pharmaceutical company, and General Instrument Corporation, an electronics company--can provide valuable lessons on how to and how not to downsize and overhaul the federal government.  There is no one formula for successfully reorganizing a major corporation or the federal government, beyond the fact that it requires making tough, serious decisions, and it is often easier for someone from outside the institution who understands that this is his or her assignment to do it than it is for an insider.  Also, not surprisingly, it is best done by someone who knows how to do it.
<P>

<B> Define The "Core" Business</B>
<P>
As overseers of the federal government, an institution which, for the sake of discussion, is arguably in Chapter XI, Members of Congress will need to treat the job of restructuring it in the same urgent, tough-minded manner so many corporations around the country are now doing.  The goal must be to earn back the confidence of the taxpayers, who are the real stockholders of the federal government.  This does not mean simply "patching," as management guru Peter Drucker has characterized Vice President Gore and his associates of doing.  The reason National Performance Review (NPR) efforts have received so little public attention, said Drucker, is that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"In any institution other than the federal government, the changes being trumpeted as reinventions would not even be announced, except perhaps on the bulletin board in the hallway.  They are the kinds of things that a hospital expects floor nurses to do on their own; that a bank expects branch managers to do on their own; that even a poorly run manufacturer expects supervisors to do on their own--without getting much praise, let alone any extra rewards."(1)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Certainly the NPR is a worthwhile effort -- a good idea.  But, much more is needed.  Techniques such as Total Quality Management, procurement reforms, or streamlining middle management will improve government, but they will only affect the problems in government programs at the margins.  Well-intended corporate managers have used the same sort of techniques and still failed or suffered.  It is vital that many of these things be done, but only after one has decided and dealt with the more central issues of what businesses to be in.
<P>
The first task is to decide what the core business is.  Once this decision is made, then everything else is secondary.  For the federal government, the four basic departments -- State, Defense, Justice, and Treasury -- have a solid basis for existence.  The other departments were either more narrowly based, were an afterthought, or both.  Some had utility when they were established, but no longer do.  Others, in my view, probably did not have a need to be at the Cabinet level even when they were first established.  A number of them were recommended and created less for organizational reasons and more to gain favor with a particular interest group.  Once one has determined the core functions to be performed by the federal government, all other activities should be scrutinized for elimination, downsizing, reorganization, movement to state and local governments or privatization.
<P>
I begin with the conviction that the first place activities should be undertaken is with the individual citizens and private organizations; next, if government must be involved, by local governments, state governments, and only last by the federal government.  In the past, this was not a workable principle in some instances because of the issue of civil rights, even though in theory it was compelling and rational.  It was clear that if some activities were left to local or state government or to individuals there would not be appropriate protection against discrimination.  Given the many civil rights laws on the books today and the progress that has been made, it is no longer the problem it was in earlier periods.  Today government services are being delivered to minorities in a nondiscriminatory manner.
<P>
My conviction is that as overseers of the federal government, Congress ought to use federal solutions only as a last resort.  The question must be asked whether a problem is truly a federal responsibility, or can it better be handled privately, by voluntary organizations, by local governments, or state governments.  I understand how difficult this is in Washington, DC, given the fact that all the institutional pressures seem to run the other direction.  But I'm reminded of a sage warning former Missouri Congressman Tom Curates once said, "Public money drives out private money."  And it does.

<P>
<B> Cut Sharply and Rapidly</B>
<P>
I read an article recently which set out some useful advice on downsizing from CEO Al Dunlap, who apparently did a skillful and swift job of restructuring Scott Paper Co.  On downsizing, he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Do it once, do it severely, and get it over with.  When a company says it is going to restructure over the next three years it won't happen . . . Don't do it!  You paralyze the company."(2)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This is sound advice for the Congress as it undertakes the massive task of balancing the federal budget by the year 2002.  Cut severely and rapidly.  Don't wait.  Whatever it is you do the odds are overwhelming that you should have done more, rather than less, and that you should have done it sooner, rather than later.  There are so many pressures in Washington, D.C., to keep the status quo, that the most frequent mistake is to make too few changes or to cut too little.  If in fact one cuts too much, which is very rare -- indeed probably unprecedented -- it is easy to add back.  But, once you cut and then find you have to go back and cut again, it is harmful to an organization.  Do it once.  Do it well.  Don't under do it.  And then let people get back to work.  Don't try to cut the dog's tail off one inch at a time, hoping it won't hurt as much.
<P>
And, a caution.  After the reductions have been accomplished, don't turn your head for a second or you will find the waste moving right back in.  It is inevitable that it will happen, and fast, unless the overseers are vigilant.  As the saying goes, "If you're coasting, you're going down hill."
<P>
Although the balanced budget plan drafted by the House Budget Committee is remarkable in its specificity and scope, in my view it ignores the principle of "cutting decisively and rapidly," in that it proposes phasing out some programs and agencies over a period of three to five years.  If a program or agency is outmoded and inefficient, phasing out its funding over a period of time will not make it less so.  For instance, I agree with those who propose to eliminate taxpayer funding for Amtrak, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and dozens of other programs that are not, or are at least no longer, appropriate federal responsibilities.  But why inflict on these programs the "death of a thousand cuts."
<P>
If Amtrak, for example, should be given the flexibility and the challenge to compete in the private sector, then why can't it be done sooner, say over the next 12 months, rather than over the next five years?  My advice is to sever public ties with much greater speed.
<P>
The Small Business Administration continues to dodge reform.  It was not even ten years old during my freshman term, yet, in a 1963 article on pork barrel spending, Life magazine exposed the SBA as a new "device for soaking up money and getting rid of it."  Based upon its early track record, we should have had the good judgment to close down the SBA decades ago.  I hope that this Congress will have the courage to act this year.  It is never to be desired, but given the current budget situation, good intentions and throwing money at problems hoping some of it will stick and do some good is unacceptable.

<P>
<B> Downsize</B>
<P>
I also recommend that Congress move swiftly to cut management and get personnel costs under control.  It is guaranteed that there are more managers and more staff in the federal government than are needed.  In less than seven months, Scott Paper eliminated 11,200 people, one-third of the work force.  The company cut 71 percent of the headquarters staff, 50 percent of management, and 20 percent of the hourly employees.  They discovered they really weren't needed.
<P>
Another example is G.D. Searle & Co., where I served from 1977 to 1985.  There we reduced the centralized corporate activities down to about 20 percent of their prior size, divested some 30 to 35 businesses, sold a variety of assets, downsized the company to close to 65 percent of its prior employee base, with the not surprising result that it worked better, earned more, and investors and owners moved the stock from about $12 a share to $50 to $60 a share.
<P>
So too at General Instrument Corporation where I served from 1990 to 1993.  There we divested five or six businesses, sold a number of assets, downsized and focused on the core business, and dramatically reduced the size of corporate headquarters, with the result that the investors and owners of the company moved the stock from below $15 a share to $50 a share.
<P>
There are hundreds of companies that are doing the same thing.  Some do it after they should have, others do it ahead of the curve.  Some wait too long, and they suffer and die.  Clearly the U.S. government is well behind the curve.
<P>
No doubt the federal government suffers even more waste on a percentage basis throughout the bureaucracy than even poorly run companies.  According to the NPR, the federal government has over 280,000 persons formally classified as "supervisors, managers, and executives, all of whom perform control functions, costing billions of dollars."  "At times," reports the NPR, "the federal government's management control system resembles a theater of the absurd."3    To make the point, if one used the Scott Paper model on downsizing as a guide, theoretically some 140,000 of these managers could be cut immediately, saving taxpayers billions of dollars.  For example, I see fewer and fewer companies where every manager has a special assistant or two.  But in government, it seems even special assistants have assistants.  Don't get me wrong.  I used to be one and I used to have one or two.  And I suspect many of you do.  Indeed, some are needed.  But, the revolution in information technology has changed the way work can be done so that excessive layering of organizations can be avoided.
<P>
<B> Reordering the Flow Chart</B>
<P>
There are a variety of ways to merge federal agencies and departments, and certainly no one way is perfect.  For example, over 20 years ago, Richard Nixon and the Ash Commission recommended that there be four basic areas:  defense, foreign policy, the economic, and domestic.  One can find powerful reasons for either merging or terminating many of the newer departments.  Some of their functions will, or course, need to continue, but certainly much of the overhead is not necessary.
<P>
While I have no special insight as to which is the preferred way to reorganize our government, I am persuaded that probably one-half to two-thirds of the non-central departments are no longer needed in their current form.  For example, the Republican proposal to close down the 93-year-old Department of Commerce seems reasonable to me.  It lacks a clear sense of mission and the fact that it duplicates the work of dozens of other departments and agencies is a sign that taxpayers could do without it in its present form.  The same could likely be said for others of the newer departments, such as Energy, HUD, Education, Transportation, and Veterans Affairs, as well as the Appalachian Regional Commission and EDA.  For example, the veterans were served before the VA was made a Cabinet rank department, as they should have been.  And they can be well-served, possibly better served, if it were to move out of the Cabinet and have some of its functions turned over to the private sector.

<P>
<B> Don't Micromanage</B>
<P>
There is no one perfect organizational arrangement.  The right people can make a poor organizational structure work well, and wrong people will assure that the best possible organizational arrangement will work poorly.  People are the key.  That is why the delays in the Presidential appointment process have been so damaging.  In many cases, cabinet and sub-cabinet posts have not been filled until after a non-trivial fraction of their entire term is over.
<P>
An important rule for a corporate board is to avoid trying to micromanage the CEO and the company.  Boards need to give management the direction to be sure, but also the freedom to run the company in the most effective and profitable way they see fit, and then hold them accountable.  One of the problems in government, and something that contributes to waste and mismanagement of the Executive branch.  My recollection from my days in the Executive branch is that Congress imposes so many restrictions, requirements, and requests on the Executive branch, no one of which is debilitating, but in the aggregate are like the threads the Lilliputians used to prevent Gulliver from moving.  This was certainly a problem at the Pentagon and I suspect still is, because of the blizzard of requests for studies and the directives and rules generated by the multiplicity of Congressional committees and subcommittees.  I want to commend you for taking steps to reduce the number of committees and subcommittees earlier this year.  It was a good start.
<P>
However, smaller government is an unachievable goal if Congress continues to try to tell the Executive branch when to turn right, turn left, speed up, or slow down.  What Congress needs to do is tell the Executive branch generally the direction to go, where the sides of the road are, and what the speed limit is.  Then Congress should stand back, oversee, and evaluate the administration on how well they do it, and if necessary calibrate the directions or change the drivers.  Too many hands on the steering wheel will put the truck in the ditch.

<P>
<B> Big Government and Big Business</B>
<P>
Anytime anyone proposes a change, there will be opposition and concern.  Change is not easy for people.  However, the fact that there is opposition and concern about proposed changes does not mean that the changes are undesirable.  Indeed change in both people and organizational assignment can bring in fresh thinking and approaches.  Certainly the entire country has seen the fresh breeze blowing through the Congress since the changes earlier this year.  It is refreshing, as even a number of my friends from the new Minority agree.
<P>
In Washington, D.C., change is a particular problem for several reasons.  Any change in the Executive branch tends to result in changes in people and organizational structure.  The effect is that it makes life less certain for people in the bureaucracy, which not surprisingly they resist.  It also makes life difficult for those they deal with -- Washington lawyers and lobbyists.  These folks have invested many, many years in the relationships and knowledge they have achieved, which, for them, is the coin of the realm.  Therefore, it should be no surprise that they often become the earliest and most effective opponents of change.  This is not because they think the change is unwise or unnecessary, but because they could lose their investment in the people and the structure as currently arranged.  They would have to start over again developing such relationships and knowledge.  This is certainly not a reason not to change.
<P>
Further, any change proposed in the Executive branch tends to result in difficulties for Congressional committees in that jurisdictions of committees can be affected.  There will be winners and losers.  Therefore, the predictable result of any proposed change tends to be that some Members of the Congress oppose it.  Here again, it is not a reason not to change.
<P>
It is important not to lose sight of the reality that Washington, D.C. is arranged in a way that only large companies are able to hire the lawyers, lobbyists, and representatives necessary to effectively interact with the Executive branch of the federal government and the Legislative branch to their advantage.  Only large companies have the resources to stay the course while the Executive departments and agencies study and delay decisions on matters that directly affect them.  Indeed, that is a competitive advantage large companies have -- they have the resources and they have the staying power.  Big businesses have the institutional capability to effectively interact with big government.  That is not true of small businesses.  Dealing with the federal government can suck the very life out of small companies that have to compete with big businesses in trying to avoid having government unintentionally take actions that are harmful to them.
<P>

<B> A Thought for Congress</B>
<P>
Thirty years ago, I testified before the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress.  One of my recommendations was to terminate the practice whereby Members of the House and Senate frequently announce federal grants, contracts and projects in their states and districts.  It didn't happen.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I said then:
<P>
" . . . to encourage or assist Members (of Congress) in making initial announcements of Federal grants, projects, and particularly Federal contracts, leaves at least a shadow of a question as to whether or not the contract or project was awarded solely, as it should have been, on factors such as cost, performance, and national interest.  I would think that a procurement officer or Corps of Engineers' official, for example, who based his decisions on needs, cost, and performance, would not be pleased to see Members' announcements of these contracts or projects leaving the impression that they may have influenced his decision."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

I suggest that government likely would shrink if Members ended this policy and thereby eliminated the incentive to have the federal government become involved in so many activities that belong in the private sector or in state or local government.  In short, implementing that recommendation would help.  As long as this practice remains, the incentive will be upside down and more and more activities are likely to move toward Washington, D.C.

<P>
<B> Privatization Insures Accountability</B>
<P>
"Corporacy" is a term relating to the private sector, meaning corporate "bureaucrats running corporations for their own good and the shareholder be damned."  Fortunately, and not surprisingly, the competitive marketplace punishes companies that become "corporacies."  Indeed, the most valuable thing that exists in business and in the non-governmental sector is the opportunity to fail.  And fear of failure focuses the mind.  Government programs are effectively insulated from the rigors of the marketplace and therefore are denied the possibility of failure.  The task for government is to find some substitutes or proxies for the possibility of failure -- for the "bottom line" -- in business.  One approach would be to have more "sunset" provisions to force legislative review after a period of years.  While not always appropriate, one other essential way of bringing this  level of accountability to the delivering of services is privatization.
<P>
Some thirty years ago, Nobel Prize Economist Milton Friedman told me that the best way of curing the problems of waste and inefficiency in the U.S. Postal System, then the Post Office Department, was to amend the law so it would no longer be a monopoly, and thereby would be forced to compete.  He was correct.  I have questions about some of the so-called "government-owned" corporations.  One effect can be to insulate such an activity from being accountable to either the marketplace or to Congress.  And, everyone needs to be accountable to someone.  The U.S. Postal Service and Amtrak are two examples.  Still other so-called government corporations, such as the Legal Services Corporation, aren't really corporations.  All the word "corporation" in the their title does is befuddle and confuse.
<P>
Certainly a number of these activities should be cut loose from taxpayers' purse and allowed the privilege of competing in the marketplace.  Competition is what brings out the best in people and organizations.  As the saying goes, "it is your enemies who make you strong."  I am attracted to the idea of divestiture or privatization of a number of government-owned enterprises such as the Air Traffic Control System, the Naval Petroleum Reserve, the Government Printing Office, public housing, defense stockpiles, and unneeded federal buildings and real estate.  I have no view as to whether it might make sense to make some of these activities "corporatized" government agencies as an interim step toward full divestiture.  In some cases, such a step might be useful in getting the some enterprise's books in order, providing time to inventory their assets, and in preparation for selling them off to people who know how to run such activities.
<P>

<B> Asset Sales</B>
<P>
I have trouble understanding why the federal government should be borrowing over $200 billion per year to cover its deficit when it is sitting on billions worth of assets that could and should be sold to the private sector to raise cash and which would then be forced to operate on a more cost-effective basis.  As the Dunlap article points out:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Inside every corporation is the biggest bank one is ever going to find -- its own assets.  My philosophy is, before you go looking for outside funding, look inside first at what you don't need.  We sold S.D. Warren, a paper subsidiary, for $1.6 billion.  It was a fine company but I believe you can't be in two capital intensive businesses and do well at both.  We sold other operations and have another $1 billion of assets on the block.  We are on track to be debt-free in 1995.  All this from a company that was heavily in debt, whose bonds weren't investment grade, when I arrived."
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Some twenty years ago, I chaired the Property Review Board in the Nixon Administration, which supervised the review of literally hundreds of federal real properties for movement to their highest and best use outside of government.  The resistance in both the Executive and Legislative branches was enormous.  That opportunity is still there and, given the current budget situation, must be seized.
<P>
Unfortunately, I am told that for the past decade or so, asset sales have been seen as somewhat of a gimmick here in Washington, D.C.  It is not a gimmick in the business world and need not be seen as such in government.  The goal of such sales is to use unneeded or under-utilized assets to reduce liabilities and to free up funds to be focused on more important needs.  This is a business-like strategy I believe the U.S. Government could usefully adopt.  I understand that the Majority's balanced budget plan does target a number of assets for sale to the private sector such as the Power Marketing Administration, the Helium Program, and the Uranium Enrichment Corporation.
<P>
That would be a start, but there are billions of dollars in assets which could still be tapped to reduce government's borrowing.  For example, the Heritage Foundation, in its very useful study, has suggested selling the government's $150 billion portfolio of direct loans to the secondary market.  This is an idea that could generate as much as $100 billion in cash.  Such steps could save taxpayers billions in future interest payments as well as have the advantage of moving such assets out of the government and into the more productive private sector.
<P>

<B> Conclusion
</B><P>
As the Congress goes about the business of putting meat on the bones of the balanced budget plan passed last month, it will have to make tough decisions.  I recognize the difficulty of that task, having served here in the House.  But I've learned that the decisions that are made every day in the corporate world are sometimes even more difficult, because the very survival of a company can be at stake.  The choices you make affect people with real careers, mortgages, and families to raise, to be sure.  But since you oversee an enterprise facing bankruptcy, you can have confidence that the decisions you make, however tough, can help to restore the long-term health of the government, our economy, and our country.
<P>
I thank you for this opportunity to share these thoughts, and I would be happy to entertain questions.

<blockquote>

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:
<P>
It is a pleasure to address this Committee on a subject which
has wrought enormous devastation on large parts of American society.
It has been well documented that during the last 15 years, American
society has experienced an alarming increase in social pathologies.
Almost every social pathology got worse, and many got much worse.
But during this pedod--specifically from 1979 to 1992--there
was one area where we made significant progress: curbing drug
use. Unfortunately, the latest reports indicate a resurgence of
drugtaking which began in 1993 and continues to get worse.
<P>
The progress against drugs was the result of a significant cultural
shift. During the late 1960s and much of the 1970s, drug use was
widely thought of -- especially by the young -- as harmless fun
or mere selfindulgence.  But by the late 1970s and throughout
the 1980s, when the human carnage caused by drug use became impossible
to deny, it became increasingly -- and far more accurately --
seen as a personal, medical and economic catastrophe.
<P>
Parents, educators, students, clergy, community leaders and even
the media helped to change and harden American opinion about drugs.
Behavioral change followed, and the federal government and many
states implemented intelligent antidrug strategies. As a result,
overall drug use went down. From the late 1970s to the early 1990s,
casual drug use by Americans dropped by over fifty percent. Between
1985 and 1992, monthly cocaine use declilied by almost eighty
percent. For a decade, drug use among young people steadily declined.
<P>
But last year, the nation received bad news on the drug front.
 Drug use among adolescents is once again on the rise. According
to the latest study from the University of Michigan's Institute
for Social Research, one in four students has used illegal drugs
before reaching high school; among 8th graders, 13 percent say
they have smoked marijuana in the last year ~ double the rate
of 1991; and over 40 percent of all 10th graders and nearly 50
percent of all 12th graders have used some illicit drug, induding
LSD, inhalants, stimulants, barbiturates, and cocaine and crack.
<P>
And hospital emergencyroom visits -- dominated by aging, inner
city drug addicts -- have increased to the highest number ever.
Cocaine, heroin, and marijuana cases all increased sharply to
new levels.
<P>
In the words of the Michigan study's principal investigator, Lloyd
D. Johnston, the drug trend is &quot;a problem that is getting
worse at a fairly rapid pace,&quot; and is being abetted by a
dedine in peer disapproval and a general softening of teenagers'
attitudes towards drugs.
<P>
These findings are part of a disturbing pattern, in a series of
studies which have documented a sharp rise in drug use. This increase
in drug use<B> should</B> have mobilized the federal government
to forcefully state the case against drug use, to enforce the
law, and to provide safety and security for its citizens. Instead,
the Clinton administration has abdicated its responsibility. The
Clinton administration has been AWOL in the war on drugs. It has
said or done little to encourage those fighting the good fight
and has proposed fundatientally misguided policies. Indeed, it
has shown much more interest in the baseball strike than in the
devastation of the young by drugs. Consider the record:
<UL>
<LI>Days after taking office, the administration cut the Office
of National Drug Control Policy's staff by more than 80 percent.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Soon after assuming of fice, Attorney General Janet Reno announced
that she wanted to reduce the mandatory minimum sentences for
drug trafficking and related federal crimes. Her focus? She is
engaged in a neverending search for the &quot;root causes&quot;
of crime and drug use.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The administration has endorsed a drug strategy calling for
a cut of more than 600 positions from drug enforcement divisions
of the Drug Enforcement Agency, the PBI, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service and other federal agencies. It is to the United States
Congress's credit that this proposal was largely rejected.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The administration has also proposed cutting more than 100
drug prosecution positions in the U.S. attorney's offices; a cut
in funds for drug interdiction and drug intelligence programs
from fiscal 1994 levels; and an unfocused, wasteful drug treatment
strategy that will do little to target hardcore users.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Last year, the Clinton Administration directed the US. Military
to stop providing radar tracking of cocaine trafficker aircraft
to Colombia and Peru.  Congress again had to reverse this senseless
policy directive.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>This week, for the first time in history, the nation's drug
control strategy was introduced without the participation of the
president.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<I>If present trends continue, by 1996 the Clinton Administration
will have presided over the greatest increase in drug use in modern
American history.</I> And let me reiterate: this will have occurred
after a reduction of overall drug use of more than 50 percent
between <TT>1979 </TT>(the peak) and <TT>1992, </TT>and a reduction
of almost <TT>80 </TT>percent in cocaine use between <TT>1985
</TT>(the peak for cocaine) and <TT>1992.</TT>
<P>
But there is more involved here than a failure of public policy.
The Clinton admir istration suffers from moral torpor on this
issue. Policy follows attitude. In 1991, when asked about his
past drug use, Mr. Clinton declared that he had never &quot;broken
any drug law.&quot; A year later, he admitted that when he was
in England, he had experimented with marijuana but &quot;I didn't
like it. I didn't inhale it, and never tried it again.&quot; Later,
when asked whether he would inhale if he had it to do over again,
he answered, to laughter: &quot;Sure, if I could. I tried before.&quot;
<P>
Keep in mind, too, that former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders
has been the administration's most prominent voice on drugs during
the last two years. Throughout her tenure, Dr. Elders had favorable
words to say about drug legalization. And apparently her dismissal
had nothing to do with her irresponsible and outspoken views on
drug policy.
<P>
These statements&#151;as well as massive policy failures&#151;are
significant because of the mindset they reveal and the signals
they send. One of the conditions that allowed the drug epidemic
to occur in the first plate was the collapse of institutional
authority. Government in the 1970s often didn't know where it
stood or what to say about drugs; Peter Bourne, who served as
President Carter's adviser on drugs, said that &quot;cocaine is
probably the most benign of illicit drugs currently in widespread
use.&quot; Today such institutional collapse is echoed in some
segments of the public Just yesterday a Baltimore grand jury recommended
that marijuana be &quot;decriminalized&quot; and that other drugs,
such as cocaine and heroin, be distributed to addicts by doctors.
It's time for all of us to reread <I>A Brave New World.</I>
<P>
Government officials, through legislation and public discourse,
can legitimize and delegitimize certain acts. In a free society,
few things matter more than speaking about the right things in
the right way&#151;and making moral common sense the touchstone
of social policy.
<P>
During the 1980s, Nancy Reagan was ridiculed for her &quot;Just
Say No&quot; campaign. But it turns out that &quot;Just Say No&quot;
is far more effective than &quot;I didn't inhale.&quot;
<P>
Mr. Clinton spent much of the presidential campaign and the first
two years of his presidency decrying, in the name of the defenseless
poor, the social programs of two Republican administrations. But
today, on one of the issues that disproportionately harms the
poor&#151;that is wiping out many of the children of the poor&#151;he
and his administration have demonstrated indifference.
<P>
That being said, the question remains: where do we go from here?
During the question and answer time, I expect to get into some
spedfics of an effective drug strategy. But here, briefly, is
a framework for what I think would work based on my experience
in the Bush administration.
<P>
If we mean to renew our efforts in the fight against drugs, the
federal government needs to do a number of things. They include
allowing communities to choose their own antidrug priorities by
combining federal antidrug support with that from states and localities;
putting the U.S. military in charge of stopping the flow of illegal
drugs from abroad, and giving the military control over the entire
interdiction process. We need to establish trade and diplomatic
sanctions and eliminate aid to cocainesource countries that fail
to reduce their production of cocaine, and require the Attorney
General first to identify all major drug trafficking organizations
known to be operating in the U.S. and then to create a plan to
dismantle them. In short, there is a lot which the federal government
ought to be doing which it is not now doing.
<P>
Mr. Chairman, I want to conclude by making an obvious but often
overlooked point: success in the drug war depends above all on
the efforts of parents and schools and churches and police chiefs
and judges and community leaders. When I was President Bush's
&quot;drug czar,&quot; I visited more than 100 cities. I made
a point to go where the problem was the worst and to visit and
to learn from the people who made things better. I saw, as just
one example, Reuben Greenberg's heroic efforts in Charleston,
South Carolina, where he cut the crime rate to its lowest point
since the 1950s. I went to public housing projects and innercity
schools and drug treatment programs; I saw extraordinary actions
and extraordinary achievements. The point is we know what works.
The common denominators are almost always the same: civic concern,
moral seriousness, and toughminded and intelligent policies. The
people I visited and people all over the country are doing great
work. Ant that work will surely go on. But they deserve to have
the federal government meet its responsibilities, too. And right
now, that's not happening.  It's a disgrace.

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>Internet Law Symposium</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"><H3><I>From Fall 1995 Discovery Journal:</I></H3><H3><CENTER>Click here for information on Internet Law Symposium 95 spekaers,sponsors, program, and how you can order a video of this groundbreakinglegal conference.</CENTER></H3><H1><CENTER><BR>Discovery Welcomes <BR>Internet Law Symposium 95 </CENTER></H1><BR>From Capitol Hill to the streets of Seattle, the Internet is the hottestthing in high technology - and Internet law is suddenly the hottest topicin the legal field. Questions about laws and the Internet are arising asthe new medium begins to realize its potential to transcend terrestrialboundaries. <BR><BR>Discovery Institute's Internet Law Symposium 95, October 30-31 in Seattle,Washington is bringing together legal experts from around the world, includingElectronic Frontier Foundation co-founder, John Perry Barlow, and high techanalyst and best-selling author, George Gilder. The Internet Law Symposiumwill pioneer the public policy side of a communications development thatseems destined to transform societies world-wide. <BR><BR><B>Sponsors for the Discovery conference include Perkins Coie, Microsoft,I.B.M., Netscape Communications, M.J. Murdock Charitable Trust, Forbes ASAP,Dun &amp; Bradstreet, GTE, US West, Corporate Computer, Northwest Nexusand Internet Group, Inc. </B><BR><BR>A key result of the gathering is expected to be formation of a permanentInternet Law Task Force to assess the legal dimensions of issues raisedby the Internet, from intellectual property rights to privacy. <BR><BR>Joining Gilder and Barlow in wrestling with international legal issues willbe Peter Harter, originator of the Internet Law Task Force, Albert Gidari,Discovery Institute Fellow and an attorney at Perkins Coie Seattle law firm,Chuck Marson, legal counsel for Nestcape Communications, Jeffrey Ritter,United Nations Rapporteur and over 25 other legal and Internet experts fromaround the world. By video conference from Washington, D.C., Senator SladeGorton and Rep. Rick White, both of Washington State, will describe thestate of debate in the U.S. capitol. <BR><BR>Evidence of the growing importance of Internet law abounds in scores ofnews reports of online gambling, conflicts on commerical rights, pornography,battles over free speech and civil liberties, and intriguing disagreementsabout intellectual property rights. Every e-mail, every website, every transactionmade over the Internet touches upon some aspect of the law, and in manycases brings forth new questions about the legalities of being online. <BR><BR>Perhaps the most intriguing question now is whether existing laws adequatelymeet the needs of the Internet. Or, is it time that a whole new sector oflaw be created? Internet Law Symposium 95 is the first conference wherethese questions will be addressed on both a domestic and international level,with active involvement from the participants and attendees. <BR><BR>&quot;One of the many problems,&quot; explains keynote speaker, John PerryBarlow, &quot;is that even if new laws need to be written, which they probablydo, it is not clear whether any of the world's governments have clear legalauthority to either write them or enforce them. It appears that most existinglaws, derived as they are for a very different social and commercial environment,may not serve us well as we try to assure order there.&quot;<BR><BR>Government involvement in regulating the Internet is currently one of themost controversial aspects of Internet law. In order to support self-regulationof the Internet, the Internet Law Task Force (ILTF) will be officially launchedduring the Symposium. <BR><BR>The ILTF will be the legal policy and norms forum for the Internet, accordingto Peter Harter, Executive Director of the National Public TelecomputingNetwork. Modeled after the highly successful Internet Engineering Task Force,the ILTF will be instrumental in developing a legal framework for the Internet.It will work closely with existing organizations that already have focusedon aspects of Internet law and legislation, and will branch out into newareas that have yet to be examined, Harter explained. <BR><BR>Both the Internet Law Symposium and the ILTF will be working to lay thefoundation necessary for the future of Internet law. By bringing togetherso many legal and technical experts, the Internet Law Symposium is ableto offer interested parties the chance to influence the shape of Internetlaw. Such input will be crucial to companies that seek to sieze the businessadvantages that the Internet can offer. <BR><BR>&quot;Business activity on the Internet is increasing daily,&quot; saidRobert Cumbow, an associate at Perkins Coie and a scheduled speaker at theInternet Law Symposium. &quot;And now is the time the Internet is explodingand people are beginning to explore its possibilities as a means of commerceand transaction. There are a lot of unanswered questions of what one canand cannot do on the Internet, and what kind of liability will apply.&quot;<BR><BR>Even as they rush to establish themselves on the Internet, individuals andcorporations alike are ignorant of the legal ramifications of this new frontier.Now, Continuing Legal Education (CLE) conferences, such as the InternetLaw Symposium 95, that offer professional credit to attorney's who attend,are providing the means for educating Internet users about Internet law.<BR><BR>&quot;There have been a lot of seminars about the Internet for lawyers,&quot;said Cumbow, &quot;but most concentrate on how to use it. The legal communityneeds information on how to advise their clients about Internet issues andproblems, and that is what the Internet Law Symposium proposes to do. Lawyerswho are going to be making the law in this area need to educate themselves,so they can give advice to their clients.&quot;<BR><BR>Discovery plans to keep abreast of Internet law issues after the symposiumand to keep its members informed. For information, call Discovery Instituteat (206) 287-3144 or reach the Institute on the Internet itself at http://www.discovery.org.<BR><HR><BR><H3><CENTER><A HREF="ilsjrn.html">Discovery Journal Fall 1995 Table of Contents</A><BR><A HREF="journal.html">Discovery Journal</A><BR><A HREF="views.html">Discovery Views</A><BR><A HREF="inquiry.html">Discovery Inquiry</A></CENTER></H3><P><CENTER><BR><A HREF="index.html"><IMG SRC="image/DIMHG.GIF" WIDTH="192" HEIGHT="81"NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

The result is a death watch as species decline and geneticvariability diminishes. ... (S)pecies should be placed on the threatenedlist early enough to allow time to manage them before they become endangered.By focusing conservation on threatened species, the severe regulatory constraintsof the Endangered Species Act can be largely removed. Only when a speciesis approaching the point where management options become limited are regulatorycontrols necessary for species conservation.&quot;</B> </DL>It's actually from a working draft of the Endangered Species ManagementAct, sponsored by Sen. Dirk Kempthorne (R-Idaho), subcommittee chairmanof the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. But the sentimentis totally in the spirit of Noah's Choice, by Discovery Senior Fellow MarkL. Plummer and Charles C. Mann (Knopf, 1995). We don't write legislationat Discovery, but we are delighted when those who do use our ideas! <BR><BR>With his co-author &quot;Cam&quot; Mann, Plummer recently also attractedwhat was described as the largest audience of legislators to show up atthe Caucus (about 100). Democratic as well as Republican members said theyare reading <I>Noah's Choice</I>. On the same visit, Plummer and Mann met,at his invitation, with Rep.

<H1><CENTER><TT>What the experts are saying about George Gilder </TT></CENTER>
</H1>
<H3>Senior Fellow <A HREF="gildrbio.html">George Gilder</A> is always a
subject of conversation due to his role as a contributing editor to Forbes
ASAP. In recent letter's to Forbes ASAP here's what some of the telecommunications
industry leaders are saying about Gilder's revolutionary ideas about the
future of telecommunications, telecomputing and the Internet. </H3>
<HR>
<DL>
<DD>&quot;I'd like to compliment George Gilder for so eloquently articulating
Sun's nearly decade- old credo: `The network is the computer.' I believe
in Gilder's thesis that we are, indeed, at the onset of the age of network-accessed,
disposable software.&quot;<B>-Scott McNealy, CEO, Sun Microsystems </B>
<DD><BR>
<DD>&quot;To report technology history accurately is a difficult task requiring
percipience, perspiration, and perspective. Gilder has done it.&quot;-<B>Larry
Tesler, Vice-President, Apple Computer </B>
<DD><BR>
<DD>&quot;Gilder is dead-on right that hardware and operating systems will
become subordinate to the network: that the network will, in effect, beAcome
enverything an the only thing. And he's right, too, about the evolution
and impact of the Internet and the resultant focus on content.&quot;-<B>Bert
C. Roberts, Jr., Chairman and CEO, MCI Communications</B> 
<DD><BR>
<DD>&quot;Once again, George Gilder's got it right. His guide to the past
and future of the Net is on the digital dime.&quot; <B>-Nicholas Negroponte,

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<H3><I>From the Fall 1995 Discovery Journal:</I></H3>
<H1><CENTER>Lynne Cheney tells Seattle the Truth </CENTER>
</H1>
<BR>
&quot;The idea that truth is something to be invented rather than pursued,&quot;
Lynne Cheney writes in her new book <I>Telling the Truth</I>, &quot;has
passed beyond narrow academic circles to influence many fields of endeavor&quot;
including: education, historical writing, journalism, psychology and even
politics. <BR>
<BR>
Cheney, former Chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities, will
speak about the importance of truth and what we can do restore it, at a
Seattle luncheon sponsored by CityClub and Discovery Institute. <BR>
<BR>
Cheney's book, subtitled <I>Why Our Culture and Our Country Have Stopped
Making Sense-and What We Can Do About It</I>, is elevating the level of
debate about truth and society all over the nation. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Some of us think of Lynne Cheney as a highly decorated veteran-many
ribbons for heroic service, and some purple hearts-of the culture wars,&quot;
said columnist George Will. &quot;This book is a vivid report from the war's
many fronts.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
If you'd like to hear Cheney's thoughts on Telling the Truth, call (206)
682-7395 for information and to reserve your seat. The luncheon is Thursday,
November 16, 12 noon - 1:30 p.m. at the downtown Seattle Sheraton Hotel
and the cost is $25. <BR>

The next debate will focus onproperty rights and Referendum 48. <BR><BR>Discovery's theory, says President Bruce Chapman, the debate moderator,is that &quot;America doesn't lack for free speech or available information.What we lack is the context of debate. It is debate that gives voters thesharpest insight into the relative merits of competing positions on theissues.&quot; <BR><HR WIDTH="87%"><B>George Speaks? NYNEX, the New York-based Baby Bell telephonecompany</B>, has made the kind decision to back Discovery's publicationof a book of George Gilder's speeches. The book will be edited by <B>FrankGregorsky, a new Discovery Fellow</B>, who has been pouring through Gilderianarcana in Tyringham, Mass. Gregorsky until recently was editor of the Washington,D.C. newsletter, <I>We, the People</I>, and came to know Gilder by coveringhim. <BR><HR WIDTH="87%"><B>Permanent Things,</B> a compendium of essays edited byAndrew Tadie and Michael Macdonald (Eerdman's, 1995), includes a chapterby <B>Discovery Senior Fellow John Wes</B>t, <I>&quot;Finding the Permanentin the Political: C.

Lewis as a Political Thinker.&quot;</I> It continuesWest's examination of what we can learn about politics and morality fromthe writings of the inimitable Lewis.....Still to come is Dr. West's pathbreakingbook on faith and politics in the early years of the United States, coveringa period that in many ways mirrors our own. According to University Pressof Kansas: &quot;Precisely because West's historical research is so solidin this book, it has much to offer for those who debate religious- politicalconnections in the late twentieth century.&quot; The Politics of Revelationand Reason: Religion and Civic Life in the New Nation will be publishednext Spring. .....

Between 1980 and 1992, casual drug use in America declined sharply.  Strong presidential leadership helped cut casual drug use in half between 1977-1992, and reduced the number of cocaine users from almost 3 million in 1988 to 1.3 million in 1992.
<P>
Since 1992, however, a sustained, intelligent and integrated anti-drug effort has been largely abandoned.  The results are not surprising:  the last four years have brought the greatest increase in teen drug use ever measured.  Consider the facts:
<P>
Illicit drug use is soaring among Americas young people.  Overall use of drugs among 12-17 year olds rose 105 percent between 1992 and 1995.  Fully 2.42 million youths ages 12-17 use drugs on a monthly basis.

Marijuana use functions as the "gateway" to hard drugs.  According to the Center on Addiction and substance Abuse (CASA), teens who use marijuana are 85 times more likely to "graduate" to cocaine than those who abstain.  As CASA director, Joseph Califano noted, "The jump in marijuana use among Americas children from 1992-94 signals that 820,000 more of these children will try cocaine in their lifetime . . . Of that number, about 58,000 will become regular users and cocaine a ddicts.</blockquote></td></tr>

<center><h3>
Statement by William J. Bennett<br>
on results of the<br>
National Household Survey on Drug Abuse
</h3>
<p>
<I>August 20, 1996</I>
</center>
<p>
The huge increase in drug use reported today in the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1995 is a national disgrace.  And the Clinton administration should be ashamed of its complete abdication in fighting illegal drug use.
<p>
Since 1992, we have watched the number of drug users go up -- way up -- year after year.  Today we learn that drug use among young people has surged again -- this time by 33 percent between 1994 and 1995.  Monthly use of marijuana use among the young is up by 37 percent between 1994 and 1995, and up 141 percent since 1992.  This has occurred after a reduction of overall drug use of more than 50 percent between 1979 (the peak) and 1992 and a reduction of almost 80 percent in cocaine use between 1985 (peak for cocaine) and 1992. 
<p>
There has been a well-documented and complete failure of public policy.  But make no mistake: there is more involved here than merely a failure of public policy.  Public policy, after all, is a manifestation of attitude.  And the "root cause" of the Clinton administration's abdication in the battle against illegal drug use is moral confusion and moral weakness.   
<p>
The Clinton administration, for whatever reason, is cavalier, unengaged, and unconcerned about illegal drugs.  It is unwilling to take a strong and unambiguous stand against drug use.  Democratic congressman Charles Rangel expressed the opinion of many when he said, "I've been in Congress over two decades, and I have never, never, never found any administration that's been so silent on this great challenge [illegal drug use] to the American people."  The motto of the Clinton administration seems to be, "We Just Don't Care" -- and so they are unwilling to act in responsible and effective ways.  Unfortunately this nation is paying a very heavy price for the Clinton administration's diffidence, in terms of wrecked and lost lives.  
<p>
On the one issue that disproportionately harms the poor -- that is wiping out many children of the poor -- Bill Clinton and his administration have demonstrated massive indifference.  The burning of black churches has caused justifiable outrage in the country.  President Clinton has taken it upon himself to speak out, time and again, against church burnings.  And he is right to do so.  But drugs have destroyed many, many, many more black families than church burnings.  Yet on the drug issue Bill Clinton is virtually silent -- in word and in deed.  Even before today's news, we knew that since Bill Clinton became president the nation has suffered the greatest increase in drug use and the largest expansion in the supply of illegal drugs ever measured.  The Clinton administration keeps adding to its infamy.  Fighting the drug epidemic requires courage, intelligence, determination, and above all, moral clarity.  Moral clarity is precisely what is missing at the top of this administration, as well as among the White House staff.

<H2>DRUGS IN AMERICA</h2>
</center>
<p>
<H3>OVERVIEW</H3>
<dd>	From 1980 to 1992, under Presidents Reagan and Bush, the federal government mounted a strong offensive against drugs, with real results.  The combined effect of vigorous foreign interdiction, tough law enforcement and a morally firm attitude of intolerance toward drug use paid off in significant reductions in both the consumption and availability of drugs. <p>
<dd>	Since 1993, America has in large part abandoned the drug war.  Americans have witnessed a failure of public policy brought about by a moral torpor; policy follows attitude.  But, as recent polling suggests, the public's attitude is not one of indifference to the drug issue.  Americans still want a tough and decisive drug control policy with the federal government rightfully leading the fight.
<p>
<H3>BACKGROUND</H3>
<ul>
<li>Drug use is a major contributing factor to violent crime, child abuse, homelessness, and poverty.  Drugs -- particularly crack cocaine -- have made these and other social pathologies more acute and often unmanageable.
<li>Between 1970 (the peak) and 1992, overall drug use decreased by over 50 percent.   Between 1985 (the peak for cocaine) and 1992, overall cocaine use declined by almost 80 percent.  And between 1984 and 1992, annual illicit drug use trends among 12th graders declined by 41 percent.
<li>The latest reports indicate a resurgence of drug use beginning in 1993.  Annual use among 12th graders is up for 1994 by 33 percent.  Marijuana use among 12-17-year-olds nearly doubled from 1992 to 1994.  And high school use of cocaine and hallucinogens has risen precipitously from a low in 1988.
<li>Drug-related hospital emergency room cases have escalated to their highest numbers since 1978.   In 1994 a record high half-million Americans were treated for drug-related problems, with serious increases in those induced by cocaine. 
<li>In a  survey released in December, 1995 by the Gallup Organization, Americans ranked drugs as the second most important problem (behind crime) facing the nation.
<li>The public strongly supports anti-drug education, strict law enforcement and interdiction; and offers little support for increased treatment programs. 
<li>Legalization of drugs is overwhelmingly rejected by Americans.
</ul>
<p>
<H3>CURRENT POLICY</H3>
<ul>
<li>Shortly after taking office, President Clinton weakened the power and slashed the staff of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.  He proposed cuts in other agencies that have been at the forefront in the war on drugs -- the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI and the Immigration and Naturalization Service -- cuts that were largely rejected by the  U.S. Congress.
<li>The Clinton policy abrogated interdiction, tough law enforcement and mandatory minimum sentences. 
<li>The strong moral message of "Just say no"  gave way to "I didn't inhale;" and to a surgeon general who advocated drug legalization. 
<li>The Clinton administration has concentrated its efforts on an unfocused treatment policy that is manifestly wasteful and ineffective.  
</ul>
<p>
<H3> RENEWING THE WAR ON DRUGS</H3>
<ul>
<li>The government should put the U.S. military in charge of stopping the flow of illegal drugs from outside our borders and give the military control over the entire interdiction process.
<li>America must establish trade and diplomatic sanctions and eliminate aid to cocaine source countries that fail to reduce their production.
<li>The federal government must identify and dismantle all major drug trafficking organizations known to be operating in the United States.
<li>Law enforcement, drug treatment and prevention education are state and local responsibilities for which current federal aid should be block granted without mandates.
<li>The President should send a clear and frequently-heard anti-drug message from his bully pulpit, making moral common sense the touchstone of social policy.
</ul>
<p>
<H3>JUST SAY NO TO DRUG LEGALIZATION</H3>
<ul>
<li>Drugs like heroin and cocaine are not dangerous and threatening to American society because they are illegal.  They are illegal because they are dangerous and threatening to American society.
<li>Any relaxation in standards of illegality would make drugs more accessible, cheaper and morally permissible.
</ul>
<p>
<H3>CONCLUSION</H3>
	
It is the first obligation of government to protect the lives and property of its citizens.  Nothing poses a greater threat to both than the scourge of drugs and the violence associated with it.   It is time for the federal government to renew its war on drugs through moral seriousness, and tough-minded and intelligent policies.

<title> Written Testimony by William J. Bennett</title>

<blockquote>
<center><h3>Written Testimony by<br>
William J. Bennett<br>
Former Director, Office of National Drug Control Policy
<p>
Delivered before the<br>
United States Senate<br>
Caucus on International Narcotics Control<br>
April 25, 1996</h3>
<p>
======================================================
<p>
</center>
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Caucus: 
<p>
Little more than a year ago I came before both the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight and the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify on the drug resurgence in America and the need for strong leadership and serious action.  The situation was serious then.  It is worse now.   Consider these events of the last fifteen months:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse reported that in 1995, almost three million 12 to 17 year olds used marijuana.  Among high school seniors, the users number one in three, according to the Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education.
<li>LSD was tried at least once by 11.7 percent of the class of 1995 -- the highest rate since record keeping began in 1975. [Monitoring the Future Study, December, 1995]
<li>The Office of National Drug Control Policy reports that "on the Texas border, the popular practice of smoking cocaine-laced 'blunts' [cigar-like marijuana cigarettes] may also be leading to an increase among teens of smoking crack."  
<li>In Chicago, a marijuana cigarette laced with both PCP and crack, called "Ozone," was marketed over the summer for $15.
<li>The popular culture, emboldened by a softened attitude toward drugs, escalated its glorification of marijuana.  Adidas brought out the "Hemp" shoe; Capricorn Records produced the album, "Hempilation;" and  20,000 young people gathered in Seattle to attend Hempfest '95.
<li>During the past year there has been a startling rise in the use of methamphetamine in California and the Southwest.  Last July we read the horrifying story of Eric Smith who, high on methamphetamine, murdered his son, cut off the boy's head, and threw it out the window of his van.
<li>It has been reported that having discovered how much money can be made, the citizens of Bolivia have gone into cocaine production rather than simply supply the raw material to other countries.  
<li>And, finally, the advocates of drug legalization have stepped into the breach and made their case vociferously during the past year.
</ul>
<p>
These are troubling trends.  But the good news is that the American people are not 
complacent.  The will to fight drugs is very much alive in the land.  Late last year, 
the Gallup Organization released the results of an extensive survey on American attitudes toward drugs.  The poll found that more than nine in ten Americans are intensely concerned about drug abuse, and that the issue of drugs rates second only to violent crime in seriousness.  When asked what they wanted to see a lot more of, more than half of the Gallup respondents cited strict law enforcement and education of the young, and two-thirds cited reduction of the supply of drugs coming into the United States.  Even more forcefully, by 85 percent, those surveyed rejected the despairing proposal that drugs should be legalized in America.  By contrast, fewer than half -- 43 percent -- asked for more treatment programs.
<p>
Clearly, citizens are aware of the devastating effect that drugs are having on 
society.  We are watching the addicts at the end of the pipeline getting 
older and sicker while seeing record numbers of young people enter the pipeline 
that leads to addiction.  In the face of all this, failure of leadership and lack of 
moral seriousness simply cannot be tolerated.  The federal government has to do a 
better job in this area.
<p>
There is no mystery to fighting drugs effectively.  This job is doable.  The
combined effort of vigorous foreign interdiction, tough and intelligent law
enforcement, accountability within the drug treatment system, and a morally firm 
attitude of intolerance toward drug use paid off in the last decade.  From the late 
1970s to the early 1990s, casual drug use by Americans dropped by over fifty 
percent.  Between 1985 and 1992, monthly cocaine use declined by almost eighty 
percent.
<p>
I commend you for holding these hearings and for the attempt to bring the drug 
issue to the top of the national political agenda.  That is certainly where it belongs.  
I urge the legislative branch to put all possible pressure on the executive branch
seriously to take up the fight.  We've done it before, and it was successful.  
Let's do it again.

<h2>Colombia, America 's Favorite 'Narco-Democracy'</h2>
<h3>By WILLIAM J. BENNET AND JESSE HELMS</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
The deluge of illegal drugs flooding into the U.S. has become one of the principal threats to our national security. More Americans die each year from the use of cocaine, heroin and other illegal drugs than from international terrorism. Yet, while the Clinton administration has rightly maintained a tough line with Libya, Iran and other governments known to be sponsoring terrorism, it has let Columbia -- which ships more cocaine into the U.S. than any other country -- completely off the hook. It is time for the administration to stiffen its spine and show some resolve in its anti-drug efforts.<p>

The administration's recent annual review of international cooperation on counter-drug efforts by major drug-producing and trafficking countries is instructive. Under this review, countries that fail to meet certain minimum standards of performance in combating drug trafficking are supposed to be denied U.S. aid. The Clinton administration acknowledged in its report that Colombia has indeed failed to meet minimum standards, yet, amazingly, granted Colombia a "national interest waiver" allowing U.S. aid to flow into Colombia despite its miserable record.<p>

This is a grave moral and geopolitical mistake. All available evidence clearly indicates Colombia has totally capitulated to the drug lords. By extending certification to Colombia, despite overwhelming evidence that its government is rife with narco-corruption, the Clinton administration has sent a troubling signal to all drug producing nations: The U.S. will impose no penalty for collusion in trafficking with the drug lords.<p>

Colombia is no borderline case. It has indisputably, become a "narco-democracy" -- a country with a facade of democratic government that is effectively controlled by drug kingpins who manipulate the political establishment with cocaine money. According to the administration's own background papers on Colombia:<p>

<ul>
<li>The Cali cartel has been left free by the Colombian government to exploit the banking system and launder vast sums of drug money with impunity.

<li>There is practically no effective investigation or prosecution of the more than 15,000 current cases of corruption involving government officials (more than half of them senior level authorities).

<li>A "guilt-laundering" system exists, in which Cali drug lords surrender, and submit to a jerry-rigged plea-bargaining system that leaves their assets intact and allbws them to plead to minor charges.

<li>The government's eradication programs have been half-hearted at best, despite massive increases in the growing of opium and new cocaine cultivation.

<li>High-level government collusion enables the shipment of enormous quantities of cocaine into the U.S., with 727 jets transiting in Mexico with tons of the drug.

<li>There is evidence of the corruption of many members of the Colombian Congress, and increasing evidence of presidential ties to the drug cartels.
</ul>

The Clinton administration cannot plead ignorance as the excuse for its abdication of responsibility. But conditions in Colombia are in fact worse than even the administration's report acknowledges. The influence of the cartels and their blood money pervades almost all aspects of Colombia's political, social and economic life. Cartel money finances political campaigns. It silences journalists. It buys judges. It infiltrates virtually every major business activity in Colombia-from cut flowers, to oil, to paper, to banking.<p>

Colombia is now the primary base for the cartels to extend their drug operations throughout the hemisphere. Despite the fact that the Cali cartel now supplies more than 80% of all the cocaine entering the U.S., the Colombian government has failed to arrest or prosecute even one significant cartel member. To the contrary, Colombia has given the cartel cover and protection from international extradition, allowing these drugs to end up on American streets and in American schools, where they destroy the lives of American children.<p>

We believe the Colombian government's collusion with the drug lords poses a direct threat to the national security of 'the U.S.  It is time to meet this threat head-on.  And since the Clinton administration has failed to provide leadership on this issue, it is all the more important that Congress assume responsibility.  That is why a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee will hold a hearing today on the issue.  And why legislation will be introduced this week to cut off all economic support, trade benefits, and military assistance to Colombia by Feb. 6,1996, unless the president of the United States can certify that Colombian President Ernesto Samper has implemented the reform agenda he promised the U.S. Congress he would enact.<p>

Elements of this agenda include investigating the financing by drug traffickers of political parties and candidates in Columbia; putting law enforcement resources behind investigating, capturing, convicting and imprisoning major drug lords in Colombia; ending the "guilt-laundering" system; confiscating assets of cartel leaders; and destroying 44,000 hectares (108,680 acres) of coca and poppy plants in Colombia by Jan. 1,1996 (and all remaining acreage by Jan. 1, 1997).<p>

The Colombian leaders must be sent a clear and unmistakable message: In the war on drugs, they can either continue to ally themselves with the cartels, and thereby become a pariah state like Libya and Iran; or they can return to the community of civilized nations, fulfill the promises President Samper made, and join with the U.S. in an effort to put the cartels out of business. The choice is theirs.<p>

<h2>Suddenly losing the war against drugs</h2>
<h3>By William J. Bennett and John P. Walters</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
<I>"[President Bush] hasn t fought a real war on crime and drugs, I will."</I><br>
	-Bill Clinton, Democratic National Convention, July 16, 1992.<p>

During the first half of the Clinton presidency, the morally serious and tough-minded anti-drug policies of the Reagan and Bush years have been replaced with such Clinton-era messages as the president's infamous "I didn't inhale" comment and the former Surgeon General's repeated calls to study the legalization of drugs.<p>

Enforcement has been de-emphasized and Attorney General Janet Reno has decried the harshness of federal mandatory minimum prison terms for drug crimes, complaining that too many dealers are in prison.  Over the past two years, the administration and its Democratic congressional allies have slashed drug interdiction and domestic drug eradication activities.  Offering enforcement assistance to -- and if that did not work, sanctioning -- foreign countries where cocaine and other drugs are produced and shipped to the US. has ceased to be a foreign policy priority.  And the Clinton administration's announced priority?  Drug treatment.  Yet neither the president nor the Democratic leaders in the 103rd Congress provided the treatment resources they said were needed most.  In this area, as in so many others, the President al said one thing and did another.<p>

The results of the administration's indifference are now in.  And they are not good.<p>

Last July, the White House released a "Pulse Check" on "national trends in drug abuse" reporting that supplies of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and other illegal drugs were plentiful.  And in mid-December, the Clinton administration announced that, in 1994, illegal drug use by teenagers -- specifically 8th, 10th, and 12th graders -- rose sharply in 1994.  (See chart.)<p>

In response, the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University warned, "If historical trends continue, the jump in marijuana use among America's children (age 12-18) from 1992 to 1994 signals that 820,000 more of 3 these children will try cocaine in their lifetime.  Of that number, about 58,000 will become regular cocaine users and addicts."<p>

The administration also revealed that drug-related emergency-room cases-- dominated by aging, inner-city drug addicts -- have reached the highest levels ever, in reporting going back to 1978.  Cocaine, heroin, and marijuana cases all increased sharply to record levels.<p>

Put another way: if these trends continue, by 1996, the Clinton administration will have presided over the greatest increase in drug use in modern American history. And this will have occurred after a reduction of overall drug use of more than 50 percent between 1979 (the peak) and 1992, and a reduction of almost 30 percent in cocaine use between 1985 (the peak for cocaine) and 1992.<p>

President Clinton has shown little concern about the carnage drugs cause.  Where violent street crime once seemed to be fed largely by battles between cocaine and crack dealers, drug testing of urban arrestees reveals most of them are drug users and under the influence of drugs when they commit a wide array of violent crimes.<p>

Drug use is also a major contributing factor to child abuse. Last April, Newsweek magazine published a long article on child abuse. It reported what those working in the field have known for years: "Drugs now suffuse 80 percent of the caseload; sexual and physical assaults that once taxed the imagination are now common." In the same month, The New York Times Magazine ran a cover story which profiled of a group of homeless, street people in New York City.  All the individuals featured in the article were drug addicts.  Whether it is violent crime, child abuse, homelessness, or inner-city poverty, drugs, -- and in particular crack cocaine -- have made those social pathologies far more acute and in some places, unmanageable.  While there are other factors contributing to these pathologies, it is crack that sustains the violence that is ripping apart large segments of American society.<p>

We believe two myths present serious obstacles to reducing such drug use.  First is the mantra that the root causes of drug use are poverty, racism and slow self-esteem."  And second is the more general view that therapy by a team of counselors, physicians and specialists is the only effective way to reduce drug use.  At their core these myths deny individual responsibility and, assume that drug use is not the product of an individual's decision, and that decisions are somehow made in a vacuum where things like f ear of getting caught, public disgrace and punishment are never considerations.  This attitude is precisely what got us in trouble in the first place.  Reversing the new drug epidemic and finishing the job of the Reagan and Bush years, requires restoring common sense about the drug problem and a recognition of the primary importance of the things contemporary liberalism has sought to discredit: enforcement, individual responsibility, and reducing the supply of drugs on our streets.<p>

Drug enforcement and individual responsibility are important because drug use can be intensely pleasurable.  The desire for drugs must be countered by certain moral precepts: drug use is wrong and those who use and traffic in illegal drugs deserve to be punished.  A responsible community teaches these things by what those in positions of authority -- parents religious leaders, teachers, friends, employers and political officials -- say about drugs and how they act toward drug use and sale.  If those in authority do not address the issue seriously, they teach that drug use is not a serious matter. And if they say
 drug use is intolerable but fail to act effectively to stop and punish those who sell and use drugs, their actions convey a much more powerful lesson than their words.<p>

Reducing the supply of drugs is important because drug use -- whether by non-addicts or
 addict -- is fueled by the desire to use and by the ease with which those who want drugs can obtain them. A nation that permits wide availability of dangerous drugs is sending its citizens particularly its youngest citizens an unwitting message: We are indifferent to drug use. The harsh reality is that drug use begins with experimentation, with a substantial portion escalating to addiction, which often ends in death. A free democratic society ought to display a special intolerance for those things that destroy people's
 virtue and eventually, destroy people's lives.<p>

There are some who believe the drug war is unwinnable.  They argue that the federal government has spent enormous sums of money to no effect and they assert that the drug trade is too rich and too powerful to be defeated. This is the "big lie" about the drug problem, and it is demonstrably false  The success of the 1980's gives witness to the lie.<p>

First the energy and resources devoted to the anti-drug effort during the last two administrations, combined with hardening public attitudes, produced dramatic declines in the drug problem. No other contemporary social pathology has declined by 50-80 percent.  The drug war was a huge domestic policy success that some have simply denied and are now dismantling.<p>

Second, while federal spending on the drug war was substantial, it only approached $12 billion at the end of the Bush years. At no time did such spending exceed federal spending for, say, NASA. The point here is that neither the space program nor the federal and-drug effort ever represented a serious burden in terms of the federal budget And busting the budget today is not required either. In fact, for the president to devote only a modicum of his valuable time seriously, to the drug issue can make a significant difference.<p>

Finally, there is no question that the drug trade has created some very wealthy and powerful criminals here and abroad. But they are not invincible. They corrupt and terrorize third-world countries and inner-city communities, largely because they are not seriously challenged. In 1989, Pablo Escobar was the well-known king of the Medellin Cartel, the seemingly unconquerable "King of Cocaine." A year later he was on the run. Eventually, even the corruption-plagued Colombian government was able to hunt him down and destroy the Medellin Cartel in the process.<p>

Our drug problem will continue to get worse until we once again pursue responsible, intelligent, and tough-minded policies. We have the means, it is simply a matter of whether we have the will. Consider this question: what would be the national response if a foreign-produced poison was contributing to the large-scale killing of white children in Chevy Chase, or Scarsdale, or Scottsdale? Would we have long debates about "root causes" -- or would we do whatever it took to close open-air drug markets, put an end to the killing, and stop the poison from reaching our children? We all know the answer to this question. It's time federal policy showed the same kind of concern for poor black inner city residents as it does for residents of upper middle class white neighborhoods.<p>

<h2>A record of failure in drug treatment</h2>
<h3>By William J. Bennett and John P. Walters</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
<I>"[We] should deal with the drug problem in a far more heads-up manner than we are now with two things.  Number one, treatment on demand without delay . . . The second thing we ought to do is find an alternative for first-time drug offenders."</I><br>
	--Bill Clinton, address at Georgetown University, December 12, 1991.<p>

Today's addicts are the most visible casualties of both the permissive culture and the drug fad of the late 1960's, 70's, and early 80's.  These addicts have moved up in the ranks from casual users.  They are largely aging, never married, and predominately male.  Most commit crimes - including selling drugs - as a means of income to purchase drugs. They are also largely concentrated among blacks and live in our inner cities.  While these addicts constitute the single largest demand for heroin and cocaine in the United States, they  also use a variety of other drugs (particularly marijuana) and alcohol.<p>

The overwhelming reaction to this problem has been a call for more drug treatment.  "Treatment on
 demand" is the preferred weapon of many in the drug fight. In fact, many liberals have argued the rational and humane response to drug addiction is to shift resources from drug enforcement and supply reduction to drug treatment.<p>

There are a number of very sophisticated and very effective drug treatment programs (many of which we visited), including very modest ones sponsored by churches and using
 variants of the 12-step method.  These are often every bit as effective as much more expensive and elaborate programs.  But the typical discussion of drug treatment in the press and by the government reflects a dangerous ignorance of the most basic facts.<p>

First, the government treatment bureaucracy is manifestly wasteful and ineffective.  From fiscal 1988 to fiscal l994, federal drug treatment spending almost tripled.  At the same lime, however, the number of treatment slots remained virtually unchanged and the estimated number of people treated actually declined by 145,000.  Why?  As with much of government, it is because the bureaucracies have consumed more and more of the resources, leaving less and less for services.<p>

Bureaucratic waste and inefficiency aside, the number of addicts served per year, measured in terms of persons served per year, is equivalent to more than half the total estimated number of cocaine and heroin addicts.  Clearly, when given the chance, the bulk of these programs are not that successful.<p>

A substantial number of addicts have attended several treatment programs.  The real-world fact is that many treatment programs are simply not effective.  In addition, federal treatment funds continue to e distributed largely on the basis of population, even though we know that addicts are concentrated in our major cities.  And there has been no effort to ensure that addicts are placed in appropriate programs.  Today, out-patient treatment slots predominate when most experts argue that the only reasonable hope of successfully treating today's hard-core addicts is to place them in long-term, residential treatment.  Bush Administration efforts to make programs accountable - to cut off support to those that did not produce results, and match resources with the need-were not enacted by Democratic leadership in Congress.  And the Clinton Administration has abandoned all such efforts.<p>

In last year's crime bill large sums were offered for drug courts.  These provisions were offered for drug courts.  These provisions were highlighted by liberals who announced that they were being "smart and tough."  The model, and essentially the justification, for this funding was the Miami Drug Court and Attorney General Janet Reno's personal involvement with it as prosecutor.  But last August, as the crime bill fight was near its peak, the Miami Herald published a lengthy report raising serious questions about the effectiveness of the program.  In particular, the program established to divert first-and second-time drug offenders into treatment instead of prison was being used by robbers and burglars to serves as little as 45 days.  .And in December the Herald reported that the chief judge overseeing the Miami drug court order an audit of the entire program, expressing alarm that it "had no mechanism to measure whether it was succeeding" A central flaw in the rush to embrace drug courts as a major answer to addiction and crime is that a very large number of addicted offenders today are long-term, hard core addicts who are poorly suited for diversion program.  Drug courts, properly run, may hold promise for treating young addicts.  But young addicts are not the primary problem.<p>

Last year, two groups of studies were released that purport to demonstrate the effectiveness of drug treatment and its superior cost effectiveness to all other categories of drug-enforcement and supply control.  One, funded by the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs, received attention for its conclusion that treatment "averages [a] $7 return for every invested."  But it included both alcohol and drug addiction and was thus too broad to be enlightening in regard to the cost-effectiveness of treating cocaine, and particularly crack, addiction -- the most destructive addiction threat today.  None of the sympathetic news reports noted that such "benefits-to-society-for-every-dollar-invested" studies for expenditures on prisons and jails have produced estimates as high as 17-to-1.<p>

A second, widely-reported study, was funded in part by the White House drug office, and conducted by the RAND Corp.  It was entitled "Controlling Cocaine," and concluded that "treatment is seven times more cost effective in reducing cocaine consumption than the best supply control program." Most of the press reports on the release of this study failed to mention that even Clinton Administration drug office officials participating in the release distanced themselves from the reliability of the methods RAND used to measure the effectiveness of supply control programs. And to our knowledge none of the press reports explained what the study actually found in regard to the effectiveness of programs treating cocaine addicts.<p>

In reviewing all forms of cocaine treatment, RAND found that 20 percent of addicts continue using drugs while in treatment and only 13.2 percent of the cocaine addicts treated reduce their drug use below weekly or more frequent use (what RAND defined as "heavy use") during the year following their treatment Overall, RAND reported, only "6 percent of heavy users leave heavy use each year [i.e., to something less than heavy use, not to be equated with no use]. About two-thirds of that out flow is apparently due to existing treatment programs . . . [and] one third of the total annual outflow from heavy use is estimated to be due to unassisted desistance from heavy use."<p>

In other words, overall, cocaine treatment is only 4 percent effective in reducing heavy use and only two percent more effective in reducing heavy use than no treatment at all. Needless to say, if the effectiveness of cocaine treatment were measured in terms of the percentage of addicts who stopped using cocaine altogether and for good, these numbers would be much, much smaller.<p>

While we should continue to support treatment programs, we need to face the harsh reality of cocaine and crack addiction: most addicts are likely do die from the effects of their addiction, sometime in their 40's, if not earlier.  This is yet one more compelling reason why preventing casual drug use by young people -- the first step on the path to addiction -- is so important.<p>

As long as the drug problem is discussed in terms of treatment vs. Enforcement or supply vs. demand, it will remain fundamentally misguided. These dogmatic positions are at odds with both reality and common sense. An effective drug policy should begin with this assumption: as long as young people and those who receive treatment reside in communities where the supply of dangerous, addictive drugs remains plentiful -- i.e., where there is de facto legalization -- prevention and particularly treatment efforts will be severely undercut and for purposes of national policy, ineffective.<p>

<h2>Why aren't we attacking the supply of drugs?</h2>
<h3>By William J. Bennett and John P. Walters</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
In August, 1989, the Medellin Cartel, led by Pablo Escobar, assassinated Colombian presidential candidate, Carlos Galan and publicly declared war on the Colombian government In response, Colombian-President Virgilio Barco launched an intense attack on the cocaine cartels.  Shortly after that crackdown began, the US military deployed the most extensive detection, tracking, and interdiction effort ever mounted against cocaine transit from the Andean countries north.  These events produced a substantial disruption in the cocaine supply to the US from 1989 to 1991, with striking consequences for cocaine and crack addicts.  For example, during the fall of l989, and well into1991,federal law enforcement agencies reported that cocaine trafficking groups were experiencing problems securing cocaine or securing it in a timely manner, even at a higher price.<p>

Reductions in the supply of cocaine to the US market are reflected at the retail level by an increase in street prices, a decline in purity, or both, or by scarcity if the disruption is large and sudden enough.  The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) compiles data on cocaine prices throughout the nation and issues quarterly and annual reports.  The data reveal that in gram amounts (the accepted retail measure), a downward trend in prices and upward trend in purity abruptly reversed in late 1989.<p>

The magnitude of the change in availability is best represented by using a standardized price; that is, a price that reflects both price and purity changes by calculating the cost of a 100 percent-pure gram of cocaine for each year.  Not surprisingly, the reduction in the availability of cocaine coincided with a 27 percent reduction in cocaine emergency room cases between 1989 and 1990.<p>

Medical examiner reports of deaths related to cocaine use during this period also declined. Analysis initiated by the White House drug office and released in the publication "Price and Purity of Cocaine: The Relationship to Emergency Room Visits and Deaths, and to Drug Use Among Arrestees, found declines in cocaine emergency room cases, deaths, and cocaine use among arrestees for the 17 US cities for which data are available. In addition, cocaine prices increased and purity decreased.<p>

Further, the cocaine supply reduction also coincides with a decline in the estimated number of heavy cocaine users (i.e., cocaine and crack addicts) throughout the country.<p>

Even though the data are limited, the forced reduction in cocaine availability between the latter part of 1989 and the first half of 1991 seems beyond question.  That it was a key causal factor in the decline of cocaine use, particularly heavy use, is the most obvious and reasonable conclusion in light of all the evidence.<p>

In addition, we know from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse that immediately prior to and during this period casual or nonaddictive use of cocaine dropped dramatically. While non-addictive users consume a much smaller quantity of cocaine than heavy or addicted users, an almost 80 percent drop in nonaddictive users between 1985 and 1992 certainly reduced demand significantly (though it cannot be measured by existing surveys and analyses). In order to increase cocaine retail prices and reduce purity, supply reduction efforts would have to cut supply beyond the surplus supply resulting from reduced demand by casual users. So the actual supply reduction was probably even greater in magnitude than the sizable change reflected in the price and purity data.<p>

The cost of the entire international drug control effort for programs and assistance to foreign countries rose from $209 million in fiscal year 1988 - to $660 million in 1992 (its peak); it moved from 4.4 percent to 5.6 percent of the federal drug control budget. Interdiction costs increased between 1988 and 1992, but almost that entire increase involved the estimated cost of Department of Defense (DOD) activities in support of the anti-drug effort.  And even with this increase, interdiction costs as a percentage of the federal drug control budget declined between FY 89 and FY92.<p>

If measured strictly by results, prevention efforts -- assisted by Presidents Reagan and Bush but primarily those carried out by parents, teachers, young people and communities throughout the nation -- made unprecedented progress in combating drug use (in particular, casual cocaine use declined dramatically). But contrary to what is viewed as settled fact by many in Washington, interdiction and cocaine source country programs seem to have been the crucial cause of the only reductions in heavy or addictive cocaine use in the past decade. The most intelligent approach to drug policy, then, is to work both the prevention and interdiction fronts; to integrate efforts instead of posing an either/or scenario.<p>

The obvious question to ask is: why didn't the reduction in cocaine supply continue throughout 1991 and beyond? The movement in the summer of 1991 of US. military resources to the Persian Gulf for Desert Shield and, later, Desert Storm, reduced interdiction coverage, particularly in regard to some of the most powerful airborne and surface naval systems.<p>

Those resources were never returned.  Today, all of the source-country governments are reducing efforts against the cocaine trade. And unfortunately there is no visible effort by the Clinton administration to prevent the complete disintegration of foreign supply control.  This is an unconscionable abdication.  We face the real prospect of foreign nations permitting the unchallenged production and shipment of illegal drugs to the U.S. and throughout the world: which is a prescription for uncontrollable supplies of illegal drugs.  Which in turn is a prescription for even greater social chaos.<p>

<center><h2>Losing the Drug War Without a Fight</h2>
<h3>By William J. Bennett</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
During the past 15 years, American society experienced an alarming increase in social pathologies.  But during this period, there was one area against which we made significant progress: drug use.  Unfortunately, the latest reports indicate a resurgence of drug-taking.<p>

The progress against drugs was the result of a significant cultural shift.  During the  late 1960s and much of the 1970s, drug use was widely thought of -- especially by the young -- as harmless fun or as mere self-indulgence.  But beginning at the end of the 1970s and throughout the 1980s, when the human carnage caused by drug use was all but impossible to deny, it became Increasingly -- and far more accurately -- seen as a personal, medical and economic catastrophe.<p>

Parents, educators, students, clergy, community leaders and even the media helped to change and harden American opinion about drugs.  Behavioral change followed, and the federal government and many states implemented intelligent antidrug strategies.  As a result, overall drug use went down.  From the late 1970s to the early lS90s, casual drug use by Americans dropped by almost one half.  Between 1985 and 1992, monthly cocaine use declined by almost 80%. For a decade, drug use among young people steadily declined.<p>

But earlier this year, the nation received bad news on the drug front.  Drug use among adolescents is once again on the rise.  Survey results for 1993 indicate a sharp increase in marijuana use for eighth- 10th- and 12th-grade students, as well as an increase in the use of stimulants, ISD and Inhalants.  And hospitals reported a record number of drug-related emergency-room visits in 1992, suggesting that heavy drug use is also on the rise.<p>

These findings should have mobilized the federal government to forcefully state the case against drug use, to enforce the law, and to provide safety and security for its citizens.  Instead, the Clinton administration has said little to encourage those fighting the good fight and has proposed fundamentally misguided policies.  Consider the record:<p>
<ul>
<li>Days after taking office, the administration cut the Office of National Drug Control Policy's staff by more than 80%. 

<li>Soon after assuming office, Attorney General Janet Reno announced that she wanted to reduce the mandatory minimum sentences for drug trafficking and related federal crimes.  Her focus? She is engaged in a never-ending search for the "root causes" of crime and drug use.

<li>The administration has endorsed a drug strategy calling for a cut of more than 600 positions from drug enforcement divisions of the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and other federal agencies.

<li>The administration has also proposed cutting more than 100 drug prosecution positions in the U.S. attorney's offices; a cut in funds for drug interdiction and drug intelligence programs from fiscal 1994 levels; and an unfocused, wasteful drug treatment strategy that will do little to target hard-core users.
</ul>
But there is more involved here than a failure of public policy. The Clinton administration suffers from moral torpor on the  issue.  Policy follows attitude.<p>

In 1991, when asked about his past drug use, Mr. Clinton declared that he had never "broken any drug law."  A year later, he admitted that when he was in England, he had experimented with marijuana but "I didn't like it.  I didn't Inhale it, and never tried it again."  Later, when asked whether he would inhale if he had to do it over again, he answered, to laughter: "Sure, if I could.  I tried before."<p>

And then there is Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, the administration's loudest voice on drugs.  While President Clinton dissociated himself once from Dr. Elders's favorable words about drug legalization, she has continued to make such statements --and the president has done nothing effective to stop her.<p>

These statements are significant because of the mindset they reveal and the signals they send.  One of the conditions that allowed the drug epidemic to occur in the first place was the collapse of institutional authority.  Government in the 1970s often didn't know where it stood or what to say about drugs; Peter Bourne, who early on served as President Carter's adviser on drugs, said that "cocaine is probably the most benign of illicit drugs currently in widespread use."<p>

Government officials, through legislation and public discourse, can legitimize and delegitimize certain acts.  In a free society, few things matter more than speaking about- the right things in the right way -- and making moral common sense the touchstone of social policy.<p>

During the 1980s, Nancy Reagan was ridiculed for her "Just Say No" campaign.  But it turns out that "Just Say No" is far more effective than "I didn't inhale."<p>

Mr. Clinton spent much of the presidential campaign and the first 14 months of his presidency decrying, in the name of the defenseless poor, the social programs of two Republican administrations.  But today, on one of the Issues that disproportionately harms the poor -- that is wiping out many of the children of the poor -- he and his administration have demonstrated massive indifference.  One would think that a little more concern and serious thought would come from a president who claims to "feel the pain" of those who suffer.<p>

<h2>Renewing the war on drugs</h2>
<h3>By William J. Bennett<br>
and John P. Walters</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p>
Through its indifference to rising drug use and its erosion of the moral and governmental foundations of the successful anti-drug efforts of the past two administrations, the Clinton Administration has put the nation on a dangerous path. The President bears the principal political responsibility for this record. And only he can use his office to begin to correct it. Congressional leaders in both parties should give him every possible to that.  If the Clinton Administration does not see the light, it should feel the political heat.<p>

As the past two years demonstrate, the nation cannot sustain an effective anti-drug effort without leadership. Congress, governors, mayors, and community leaders, need to meet this challenge.  There are specific roles to fill for federal, state, and local governments, as well as the private institutions that support our families and communities.<p>

<I>Restoring effective federal action</I><br>
The cornerstone of national anti-drug efforts is to give force to the principle that drug use is wrong, harmful and will not be tolerated. This principle should be embodied in the institutions of society, which, in turn, should be organized to give force to that principle.  Without the federal government doing its part, this endeavor will be much more difficult<p>

1. While efforts by the federal government are not sufficient, they are a necessary element of an effective national anti-drug effort.  Executive leadership begins with the president and his appointees in relevant executive agencies. The White House drug policy office was created - at the insistence of a Democratic Congress - to organize and lead the war on drugs. Right now that office is not doing its job, and the Clinton Administration made it largely irrelevant. The President should give someone the responsibility and the authority to get the executive branch, and the federal government, back in the fight.<p>

2. The world headquarters for the cocaine industry is Colombia. The era of meaningful partnership with that government has ended. And there are reliable press reports that the current president of Columbia received campaign money from the cartels. But the heart of the matter today is that U.S. and Colombian enforcement agencies know who the leaders of the cartels are and where they are. The Colombians could arrest or force into hiding the management of the cocaine industry, and disrupt the cocaine trade as they have done in the past. But there is no evidence the Colombian government has any intention of doing so. Occasional showy enforcement operations continue, but no real efforts are mounted and therefore no real progress is made. The US. government has done virtually nothing to give the legitimate interests in Colombian society reason to undertake the risk and effort of making their government put the cocaine trade out of business. It is time to give them such a reason. During the recent embargoes on Iraq and Haiti, experts warned that these measures are most effective when applied rapidly and totally against a trading ally. The US. accounts for more than 35percent of Colombia's licit foreign exports. Such action against Colombia would change the priority of anti-drug efforts throughout the international community.<p>

3. Put the US. military in charge of stopping the flow of illegal drugs from abroad. Require federal law enforcement agencies responsible for drug interdiction to operate under the overall command and control of the military. This mission will require continuous adaptation because traffickers will inevitably try new avenues as the old ones become too costly. Some in the military will object to this non-traditional mission and its cost. But no law enforcement organization will ever have the intelligence and operational capabilities for the interdiction task that the military already possesses. Over the last few years the US. has used its military resources to protect poor and endangered citizens of other countries.  It is time-it is past time- to stop overlooking the poor and endangered in our cities.<p>

4.  The drug trade inside the US. relies on sophisticated senior management.  Despite periodic law enforcement successes, federal domestic enforcement agencies have produced no serious disruption of major trafficking operations.  And for the last two years the Clinton Administration has allowed the DEA, FBI, and other drug enforcement agencies to curry political favor with local authorities by assigning federal personnel to augment manpower for cases with no federal significance.  This might be acceptable if important federal responsibilities were being met.  But they are not.  We therefore need to establish clear federal drug enforcement priorities and hold enforcement authorities accountable for meeting them.  For example, the Attorney General should be required to prepare a report every six months identifying all major drug trafficking organization know to be operation in the US and  a plan to deploy federal enforcement personnel to dismantle them.  Congress should also make the funding for federal enforcement personnel to dismantle them.  Congress should also make the funding for federal drug enforcement agencies contingent on effectively implementing this policy.<p>

5.  The Congress should combine existing federal aid to the states and localities for drug enforcement, prevention, and treatment (now, roughly $3.5 billion per year) into a single block grant distributed on the basis of population.  Individual program mandates should be abolished so states and localities can establish and pursue their own priorities for fighting drug use and drug crime.  Law enforcement, drug treatment, and prevention education are local responsibilities.  Washington's bureaucratic regulation has utterly failed to engender programs that foster local accountability.  Therefor, the new block grand should be designed to restore local responsibility by phasing them out after three years.  In this way, communities will have an incentive to use these funds for those activities that demonstrate sufficient merit to deserve long term support entirely from local sources.<p>

<I>Creating effective local action</I> <br>
6.  Drug prevention is central to all effective anti-drug efforts.  Young people who do not use drugs in their teens are unlikely to ever become involved with illegal drugs.  But each generation bust be taught that illegal drug use is wrong and harmful.  This lesson must be taught by the community as a whole; indeed, by our culture.  Children learn about drugs by what the adults around them as a whole say and do.  Parents teach by precept and example.  The same is true of schools and the communities.  If drug use and sale is not aggressively opposed and prevented, children learn it is acceptable despite what some adults may occasionally tell them.  Teaching drug prevention must be apart of teaching children right from wrong.  It will always fall to parents to provide that education in home and act to ensure that schools and their communities are teaching this lesson effectively.  This task is easier if national leaders set the right example and speak in support of parents.  But since that national support has seriously eroded, parents, churches, schools, youth organization, and communities are more important than ever.  They have always been, and will always remain, the first line of defense for children.<p>

7.  Open-air drug markets feed addiction and are a visible sign of the toleration of the drug trade in our nation.  It is a national disgrace that such markets are tolerated in virtually every major American city. Drug pushers cannot operate effectively when law enforcement personnel are present.  Forcing drug deals from open spaced makes their lives more difficult and dangerous and hence their activities less frequent.  Many communities have demonstrated that creating a law enforcement presence and maintaining it in response to relocation efforts by drug dealers is doable - but only if closing drug markets is made a priority.  In the next year, mayors, city councils, and police chiefs should pledge and make clear that they will insist that these officials keep it.  We need to stop claiming that the crime and drug problem in our communities is someone else's responsibility.  Decisive action can be taken by local officials and community members now.<p>

8.  Drug testing is a proven tool to discourage drug use by individuals in treatment and those in the criminal justice system.  Good treatment programs require regular testing and apply sanctions against individuals who relapse.  Drug testing arrestees provides a basis for using bail, sentencing, release conditions and other aspects of the criminal justice system to compel individuals to stop using drugs.  Including an extended period of regular testing after offenders complete their sentences, discourages a return to drug use and crime.  Positive drug tests must involve steadily escalating penalties (starting with a one or tow-day return to jail or a half-way house and moving to reincarceration for an extended period).  Most heavy drug users pass through the criminal justice system and any short-term of a drug testing program will save larger costs to the community in repeated criminal justice expenditures on the same individual land the damage their crimes do to the innocents.<p>

These eight steps - involving federal, state, local, and individual action - will reverse the dangerous resurgence of drugs that has occurred during President Clinton's watch.  These actions will help turn the country away from its present course and go a long way toward making progress in the war on drugs.  And that, in turn, will help America to become a safer, more decent and more civilized society.<p>

<blockquote>
<u><h3>Impact of Drug Use</h3></u>
<P>
 <B>Illicit drug use is extremely costly to society</B>.  One
study conducted by Columbia University's Center for Addiction
and Substance Abuse found that drugs cost New  York City alone
$20 billion annually, or 21 cents of every taxpayer's dollar.
<BR>

<P>
 <B>Drug abuse is surpassed only by violent crime as the issue
Americans consider the most serious facing the nation</B>.  According
to a recent Gallup poll, 94 percent of Americans surveyed consider
the use of illegal drugs a &quot;crisis.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<h3><U>Drugs &amp; Crime</h3></U>
<P>
 <B>The vast majority of criminals use drugs</B>.  Data from Bureau
of Justice Statistics studies show that 79 percent of state prisoners
in 1991, 60 percent of federal prisoners in 1991, and 83 percent
of youths in long-term public juvenile facilities in 1987 had
used drugs at some point in their lives. <BR>

<P>
 <B>Drug use contributes to and exacerbates other crimes</B>.
 The Bureau of Justice Statistics also found that 31 percent of
prison inmates in 1991 had reported being on drugs at the time
of their offense.  In addition, more than 80 percent of reported
cases of child abuse involve illicit drug use by the abusing adult.
<BR>

<P>
 <B>The percentage of prisoners convicted of drug charges has
increased</B>. The number of persons convicted of violating federal
drug laws rose to 17,349 in 1991 from 5,981 in 1981, an increase
of 190 percent.  The number of drug trafficking convictions in
State courts more than doubled between 1986 and 1990.  In 1960,
approximately one out of every 25 prisoners was incarcerated on
drug charges; today, around one in three is.<BR>

<P>
 <B>Mandatory sentencing requirements have corresponded with a
higher rate of  conviction and punishment of drug offenders</B>.
 More than 170,000 people were convicted of drug trafficking charges
in 1992, more than four times as many people so convicted just
four years earlier (before mandatory sentencing requirements).
 About half of those convicted were sent to prison, compared to
around 37 percent in 1986.<BR>

<P>
 <B>Mandatory sentencing requirements have corresponded with a
significant increase in the average length of sentences imposed
on convicted drug traffickers</B>.  Since the U. S. Sentencing
Commission set guidelines on November 1, 1987, the average drug
sentence has more than tripled from 23.1 months in 1987 to 84.2
months in 1991.<BR>

The skyrocketing increase in the use of illegal drugs has been accompanied by a softening of attitudes toward drug abuse.

Since its birth on Earth Day, 1970, the modern environmental movement can
claim many successes:  Air and water are cleaner; automobiles operate more
efficiently and pollute less; "smokestack" industries are more
environment-friendly than ever before.  

<P>
Perhaps more impressive than these tangible achievements is the impact the
environmental movement has had on American culture.  The vast majority of
Americans now think of themselves as "environmentalists," and most people
engage on a regular basis in some activity (e.g. recycling newspapers) that
allows them to act personally on their environmental beliefs.  The
environmental movement fundamentally changed American values on a scale
comparable to such great historical movements as Methodism and the American
suffrage movement.<p>

<title> America To Receive Six Times The Sex and Violence From Broadcasters </title>

<h2> AMERICA TO RECEIVE SIX TIMES THE SEX AND VIOLENCE FROM
        BROADCASTERS, COMPLIMENTS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT</h2>
</center>
<p>
<b>Washington, DC --</b>  The networks and broadcasters are looking to double their pleasure.  And if
given twice the airwaves, we will all be subjected to six times the violence and six times the sex
already provided on network television.
<p>
     "As early as next week, HR 1555, a telecommunications bill that would give broadcasters
spectrum valued at up to $100 billion free of charge, may come to the House floor.  Broadcasters,
in this sweetheart deal with Congress, would receive spectrum initially allocated to them for
transition to High Definition Television (HDTV).  Recently, however, they have revealed that
they intend to use the airwaves for whatever is most profitable for them, such as the addition of
up to six new television channels, paging, cellular, or similar services,"said Small Business
Survival Committee president Karen Kerrigan.
<p>
     Last week, Kerrigan announced the formation of the Campaign for Broadcast
Competition (CBC), a coalition formed to spawn debate on the spectrum issue to expose the
tremendous loss of taxpayer funds to wealthy broadcast networks.
<p>
     "Instead of promoting the growth of new telecommunications industry by auctioning the
airwaves on the free market, we can expect the broadcasters to air six times the violence, sex and
immoral content already provided in order to sell advertising and increase their ever-expansive
profits," said Kerrigan.
<p>
     And, in a National Press Club Speech, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt called for a "Contract
for Kids and Community," in an attempt to clean up the airwaves.  Yet, with HR 1555,
broadcasters may double their spectrum giving them free reign, in all aspects, to insult the
sensibilities of middle America with scenes of deviance and violence.
<p>
     "The broadcasters say they deserve these airwaves because they are providing a public
service.  Let's examine the public service accessible to us now:  According to a 1994 study
conducted by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, during an 18 hour period, an average
viewer can expect to see 1,217 violent scenes on network shows and 388 violent scenes in
commercials and promotions.  According to the American Psychological Association, the
average child watches 8,000 murders and 100,000 acts of simulated violence before finishing
elementary school," Kerrigan added.

<h2>Hijacking the Broadcast Spectrum</h2><br>
<b>Opinion Editorial by 
Karen Kerrigan,
President
Small Business Survival Committee
&
Founder,
Campaign for Broadcast Competition</b>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Here is a story you won't see on network shows such as "60 Minutes," "Dateline," or
"Prime Time Live." <p>
America's network broadcasters are scurrying to preserve one of the greatest government giveaways in history.  In an era when telecommunications companies are paying the government for the use of our nation's airwaves, the broadcasters are on the verge of gaining additional spectrum for free.   A gift of taxpayer assets which, if auctioned, could raise more than $100 billion for federal debt reduction.  Even in Washington, that's a big number.<p>
This sweetheart deal will double the amount of spectrum each broadcaster currently
controls, and will allow them to offer new services such as two-way paging and wireless voice and data services, in addition to multiple channels of digital television.  It should cause considerable consternation to the telecommunication companies who have had to pay billions for their right to use the airwaves.<p>
The deal originated as part of the government's attempt in 1991 to develop an American version of High Definition Television (HDTV).  Experts were afraid that the Japanese would dominate the next generation of television technology and eliminate any American presence in the high-profile consumer electronics industry.  In a classical case of wrong-headed industrial policy, the FCC coordinated the technology development effort, and agreed to provide the broadcasters with additional spectrum to transmit the HDTV signal in order to create a market and make the transition from analog television.<p>
But a funny thing happened on the way to the market.  Technological gains made HDTV a technological dinosaur -- especially in the broadcaster's eyes.  They realized that they could provide digital (but not high definition) television utilizing a fraction of the airwaves, making way for multiple television channels, while leaving space for other lucrative services.<p>
Given the market and technological realities, the broadcaster's reneged on their
commitment to deploy HDTV.  However, they still want the spectrum.  They argue that -- without the additional spectrum -- they will never be able to compete with the new players in television, such as cable and telephone companies.  This, despite a fifty year head start.  They also argue that paying for additional spectrum will sound the death knell for "free T.V." <p>     
This line of reasoning rings hollow, especially with a budget-focused and  market-oriented Congress.  For the past fifty years the broadcasters have profited handsomely from their current business;  there is certainly no need for the federal government to guarantee their future success as participants in a competitive communications environment.  It is also hard to feel sorry for an industry whose performance last year was the most profitable in history.  It is difficult to see this as the end of advertiser-supported television.<p>
A few Members of Congress and concerned citizens are finally raising this issue for what it really is -- a multi-billion dollar giveaway.  It is an insider deal that will come at the expense of others.  With increasing pressure to reduce the national debt, Congress cannot let this deal pass by unchallenged.<p>
More importantly, an extremely expensive and profoundly wrong presumption remains
untouched:  that the government should continue to be in the business of promoting certain technologies such as HDTV, or attempting to guarantee the success of an industry by shielding, for example, the broadcasters from competition.  Recent communications success stories such as direct broadcast television and cellular telephone service offer compelling evidence that the market remains the only effective vehicle for selecting industrial winners.<p>
The recent wireless auctions, where telecommunications companies bid $10 billion to
offer a new generation of cellular services, provide an effective model for allocating the public airwaves.  It would work beautifully in allocating spectrum now being offered free of charge.  Allow the broadcasters to keep their current, free licenses to use for broadcast television.  Put the new spectrum allocation up for auction.  And forget about foisting HDTV technology onto the American public -- if they want it, someone will figure out a way to offer it to them and make the necessary investment.<p>
     The current proposal reflects wasteful stewardship of a valuable asset.  At a time ofheightened awareness of our budget limitations, Congress should not be bullied into this giveaway.  Economics, not special-interest politics, should decide the allocation and uses of the spectrum.  In a competitive telecommunications environment, entrepreneurs will meet and create new demands.<p>
Allow the market to determine the value and use of this asset and let competition reign. It will pay great dividends to consumers, the economy and the Treasury.<p>

TO:  Concerned Citizens<br>
FROM:  Small Business Survival Committee<br>
RE:  <i><b>Broadcast Spectrum Could Cost Taxpayers Billions</i></b><br>
DATE:  August 3, 1995
<p>
<hr>
<br>
The Federal Communications Commission is about to give away billions of dollars worth of public airwaves to television broadcasters free -- this after the broadcasters have already made billions on the free television licenses they already possess.  Under the current plan, the broadcasters will double their spectrum and can use it for anything they want from pay television to cellular phone service to paging -- all at the taxpayers' expense.  The spectrum should be auctioned, creating a competing broadcast environment, encouraging the growth of new companies and granting up to $100 billion to reduce the deficit. <p>
Last week, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt called on broadcasters to forge a "Contract for Kids and Community" to meet the public interest obligations they have already shirked.  Hundt's efforts to expand education programming and attain concrete commitments for broadcasters to help parents choose high quality, nonviolent programming are well-meaning.  But he has failed to connect the dots.  The broadcasters have proven in the past (and backed by public opinion surveys) that they
do not use their spectrum to further the public good.<p>
<h3>WHY AUCTIONS?</h3><p>
Since Congress decided in 1993 to stop giving the airways away free, telecommunications companies have bid over $10 billion in auctions to obtain spectrum to provide services.  Why are the broadcasters entitled to twice as much spectrum at no cost?  Shouldn't they compete along with everyone else for the rights to use the public's scarce spectrum?  Hasn't the government proven that it is lousy at picking "winners and losers" in the marketplace?  Competition makes the best decisions for consumers not the government.<p>
Broadcasters claim that auctioning the spectrum will mean the end to free television. 
Competition has benefited not only consumers, but the broadcasters!  What they fail to mention is that the broadcasters have just enjoyed their most profitable year in history. <p>
Apart from denying broadcasters corporate welfare they do not deserve, auctioning the spectrum will provide funds and flexibility to truly use the spectrum for public good.  Auction proceeds could be used to reduce the national debt and better yet, new innovative broadcast companies will provide the public with the quality programming they are demanding.<p>
<h3>ACT NOW</h3><p>
The National Association of Broadcasters is a very powerful lobby in Washington.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich is on record saying no one will take them on.  FCC Chair <a href="mail to:kidstv@fcc.gov"> Reed Hundt</a> (e-mail address: kidstv@fcc.gov) and <a href="mail to:georgia@hr.house.gov">Speaker Gingrich</a> (e-mail address: georgia@hr.house.gov) need to hear from concerned taxpayers who will not sit idly by while the powerful NAB seeks protection from market competition and robs American consumers of innovative services and costs taxpayers billions of dollars.<p>
The FCC is considering this issue now, and must hear from concerned citizens when possible. We suggest that you send a letter to Speaker Gingrich and Chairman Hundt to send them the message that the public hopes that not all of its officials share their fear of the broadcasters.<p>

<h3>Gift to TV Networks</h3>
<br>
To the Editor:<p>
Re "Media Mergers" (editorial, Aug. 2): Under pressure from the television networks,
Congress and the Federal Communications Commission will soon reward these
megacorporations with a multibillion-dollar deal to double their share of the airwaves free.  The broadcasters were to use this spectrum for the transition to high-definition television.  However, they are reneging on that deal -- to provide more "quality" television.  They will also use the airwaves for paging, and voice and data services.<p>
Recent auctions of public airwaves raised $10 billion to reduce the deficit; if these
companies paid billions, why shouldn't Disney, Group W and Rupert Murdoch?  The giveaway is valued at $10 billion to $100 billion.  Unless Congress reverses course, the taxpayer will pay.<p>

 --- SBSC'S KERRIGAN ANNOUNCES CAMPAIGN FOR BROADCAST COMPETITION ---
</center>
<p>


<b>  WASHINGTON, DC --</b> The already rich and powerful television networks and
broadcasters, who have made billions on the free television licenses given to them by the
government, are abut to get even more, courtesy of the U.S. taxpayers.  Congress and the Federal
Communications Commission, in a bill which has passed the Senate and will soon be considered
by the House, will bestow on broadcasters -- for free -- new spectrum valued at up to $100
billion, according to Karen Kerrigan, President of the Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC).  The plan will double the airwaves controlled by each television broadcaster.
<p>
     Kerrigan today announced that SBSC is creating the Campaign for Broadcast
Competition (CBC), a coalition formed to facilitate a debate on the spectrum issue to expose the
television broadcasters' plan to shortchange the U.S. taxpayers.  The Campaign will be joined by
individuals and public policy groups around the country to enhance public awareness and
understanding of this issue.
<p>
     "The broadcasters were initially supposed to receive this valuable spectrum as a way to
shift their current analog service to High Definition Television (HDTV) but have recently
admitted their intention to use the spectrum, not just for HDTV, but for whatever is most
profitable for them such as the addition of up to six new television channels, or paging, cellular,
or similar services.  And Congress is going along with this plan!  Do the promoters of shows
under attack by this very same Congress for their violent sexual content deserve this multi-billion
dollar gift?," Kerrigan said.
<p>
     "The Campaign is asking only that the television broadcasters be treated the same as
every other entity that wants new rights to the airwaves.  The spectrum should be auctioned off,
creating a competitive broadcast environment, encouraging the growth of new companies and
generating up to $100 billion to reduce the federal deficit.  In an era when spectrum auctions are
welcomed by government for new wireless services, it is incomprehensible that they continue
corporate welfare to benefit America's wealthiest interests."
<p>
     "The marketplace is the only place to pick winners and losers.  Competition makes the

<p>
On April 27, Heritage Vice President for Educational Affairs <a href="/heritage/staff/meyerson.htm">Adam Meyerson</a> 
was a guest lecturer at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. 
 According to former Congressman Mickey Edwards, who had organized the curriculum, 
Meyerson's class was rated by the students as one of the course's highlights. 
        
<p>
Though many in the academic community remain openly hostile to conservative 
ideas, The Heritage Foundation's academic outreach programs are attempting 
to break the left's hold on academia. Activities include the Bradley Scholars 
Program, Salvatori Center for Academic Leadership, Resource Bank, and Lectures 
and Seminars.
<p>
<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">B</FONT>radley <FONT SIZE = "+2">S</FONT>cholars</H3></CENTER>
<p>
The Bradley Scholars Program, made possible by a grant from the Lynde and Harry 
Bradley Foundation of Milwaukee, welcomed its eighth class to Washington in 
September: crime reporter <a href="/heritage/staff/carlson.htm">Tucker Carlson</a>, a former Policy Review Assistant 
Editor, who rejoined Heritage after a year as an editorial writer for the Democrat-Gazette 
in Little Rock; <a href="/heritage/staff/toler.htm">Herbert H. Toler, Jr.</a>, an expert on the black church in America, 
who joined Heritage from Union Theological Seminary and Howard University; 
and <a href="/heritage/staff/hood.htm">John Hood</a>, Vice President of the John Locke Foundation, Raleigh, N.C., 
a prominent state think tank.
<p>
The Bradley Scholars Program provides writers and academics with a venue in 
Washington for conducting long-term research and writing projects geared to 
current public policy issues.

<p>
Forty college and university faculty members and advanced graduate students 
were named Heritage Foundation Salvatori Fellows in 1994.
<p>

Focus of the Salvatori Center's Annual Conference for Academic Leadership, 
held May 11-12, was "The Constitution of Ordered Liberty: Academic Questions 
for the 21st Century."  More than 100 scholars, academic administrators, and 
journalists attended the conference. The annual Salvatori Awards for Academic 
Excellence were presented to Henry Manne, George Mason University School of 
Law, Fairfax, VA, and Edward Banfield, Harvard University.
<p>
Heritage's Salvatori Center for Academic Leadership was established in 1991 
to encourage academic excellence and stimulate the study and discussion in 
higher education of the ideas and principles that form the foundations of America's 
political and cultural traditions. Salvatori Center programs are made possible 
by a grant from the Henry Salvatori Foundation of Los Angeles.

The "networking" arm of Heritage's Educational Affairs program, the <a href="/heritage/resource_bank/rtoc.html">Resource 
Bank</a> is a cooperative exchange program involving more than 2,000 university 
professors, academic research centers, educational foundations, and policy 
groups in the United States and abroad. The purpose of the Resource Bank, which 
was established in 1977, is to help conservative scholars and policy specialists 
participate more fully in the policy-making process.
<p>

Some 300 Resource Bank members from a record 130 organizations attended the 
17th Annual Resource Bank Meeting in Chicago in April. The theme of the two-day 
conference was "Restoring the American Community: The `New Citizenship' at 
Work," a phrase coined by Bradley Foundation President Michael Joyce to describe 
the rebirth of grassroots activism around the country.  The program highlighted 
the efforts of volunteers, activists, entrepreneurs, and citizen-legislators.
<p>
The Resource Bank's working groups focused in 1994 on state issues, public 
interest law, unfunded federal mandates, family issues, and foreign and defense 
policy issues.

<p>
What do film critic Michael Medved, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jeremy 
Boorda, Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist, and the Ambassadors 
of Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico have in common? They all spoke at 
The Heritage Foundation last fall, all in the same week. Their presentations 
were overshadowed that week by another Heritage speaker: California Gov. Pete 
Wilson, whose denunciation of costly federal mandates made headline news around 
the country and was broadcast repeatedly by SPAN, the Cable-Satellite Public 
Affairs Network.
<p>

<P>
The Heritage Foundation in 1994 remained one of Washington's leading forums. 
Thousands attended the more than 100 public lectures and seminars, and millions 
more watched the proceedings on public-affairs television or read the published 
lectures.
<p>
<B>Among 1994's notable events:</B>
<p>
 The inauguration of a 10-part lecture series, "Sweet Land of Liberty: Strengthening 
America's Culture," sponsored by the Salvatori Foundation. 
<p>
 The Ambassadors Forum on Free Trade, a panel discussion with the four previously 
mentioned ambassadors, held just weeks before the "Summit of the Americas."
<p>
 A major conference on reforming the U.S. agricultural system, featuring three 
former Secretaries of Agriculture: John Block, Earl Butz, and Clayton Yeutter.
<p>
In addition to several governors and numerous members of the House and Senate, 
featured speakers during the year included Heritage Distinguished Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William 
Bennett</a>; Mickey Kantor, the U.S. Trade Representative; William Kristol, Chairman 
of the Project for the Republican Future; G. Gordon Liddy, the popular radio 
talk-show host; Gen. Merrill McPeak, the U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff; Gen. 
Gordon Sullivan, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff; Cal Thomas, the popular author, 
columnist, and television talk-show host; and Robert Woodson, President of 
the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise.

"The Heritage Foundation is without question the most far-reaching conservative 
organization in the country in the war of ideas, and one which has had a tremendous 
impact not just in Washington but literally across the planet." - House Speaker 
Newt Gingrich, R-GA.
<p>

<p>

When more than 300 Republican congressional candidates joined House Minority 
Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., on the steps of the Capitol for a Sept. 27 "photo 
op" - intended to focus national attention on the House GOP's "Contract with 
America" - liberal "spin doctors" warned that Gingrich & Company had gravely 
miscalculated.  Weeks later the voters delivered their own verdict: It was 
the spin doctors who had miscalculated.
<P>
The "Contract with America" drew heavily from years of Heritage Foundation 
research.  While not every detail of every proposal was identical to the recommendations 
made over the years by Heritage analysts in their congressional testimony, 
articles, books, and research papers, the similarities were striking.  Said 
the liberal Boston Globe: "As the leading source of scholarship for that [conservative] 
movement, The Heritage Foundation has been able to hammer home a simple message: 
Government programs have done more to worsen the nation's social problems than 
to heal them."          
<P>
Heritage welcomed the 1994 political season with "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/issu.html">Issues '94</a>," a first-of-its-kind 
candidates' briefing book providing comprehensive data on a dozen key national 
issues, from federal spending and defense policy to congressional reform. Newt 
Gingrich, who would become the new Speaker of the House in 1995, called the 
book, which was made available to every House and Senate candidate (and, on 
request, several gubernatorial candidates), an example of Heritage at its best: 
doing "serious work ... and thinking about not just how to get power, but how 
to use power for the nation's good." In the final weeks of the fall campaign, 
talk-radio host Rush Limbaugh read extensive excerpts from "Issues '94," which 
had become a primary reference source for dozens of campaigns. Many of these 
campaigns were successful. 
<P>

<P>

Following the conservative victory in November, Heritage was ready once again 
with a policy blueprint for the new 104th Congress. The 19-chapter "New Member's 
Guide to the Issues" - compared by some to Heritage's Reagan-era "Mandate for 
Leadership" series - offered concrete suggestions for a conservative reordering 
of Washington on issues as diverse as agriculture, the budget, crime, defense 
policy, education, regulation, taxation, and trade. The Guide served as the 
basic "textbook" at Heritage's freshman orientation program for new members 
of Congress, held in December in Baltimore. 
<P>


"Issues '94" and "The New Member's Guide to the Issues" were both collaborative 
efforts involving The Heritage Foundation's entire research staff.

<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
"The Clinton administration does take national interests into account when 
formulating foreign policy. The trouble is, they are frequently the interests 
of other nations," Lawrence Di Rita, Deputy Director of Foreign and Defense 
Policy Studies, told reporters in one of several well-attended briefings in 
1994. 
<P>

<p>
Heritage analysts throughout the year continued their efforts to bring needed 
clarity and focus to America's meandering foreign policy. The big picture was 
provided by the updated monograph, "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/safe.html">A Safe and Prosperous America</a>," which went 
into a second printing in 1994. With more than 10,000 copies in print, the 
global blueprint is now used by more than two dozen universities and graduate 
schools, including America's war colleges, as a primer on foreign policy and 
national security. The book explains how U.S. national interests should be 
used to establish foreign policy goals, how to evaluate potential threats to 
those interests, and how to build and maintain the military forces needed to 
respond to potential threats.
<P>

<p>
Individual papers during the year examined the dangers of putting U.S. forces 
under foreign command as part of U.N. "peacekeeping" missions, warned of the 
danger of cutting too deeply into the U.S. defense budget, urged the United 
States not to abandon the idea of building missile defenses, and developed 
a strategy for revamping the U.S. foreign-aid program.

With the approval of  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) shortly 
after Thanksgiving, Heritage's ongoing efforts to promote the global expansion 
of free trade reached another important milestone. The long march, however, 
is far from over: Of the 101 countries ranked on Heritage's "Index of Economic 
Freedom," released at year's end, just 25 had free or "mostly free" trading 
policies.
<P>


One of the main objectives of Heritage's two-year-old American Trader Initiative, 
a joint effort involving both the business and policy communities,  is the 
liberalization of the rules governing international commerce. The program is 
based on the belief not only that free trade furthers U.S. national interests 
by creating new business opportunities for American companies, but that economic 
freedom helps spawn political freedom as well. The long-term goal of the program 
is a free-trade area encompassing both the Western Hemisphere and Pacific Rim. 
<P>

<P>

In addition to their work on the GATT agreement, Heritage trade experts pushed 
the administration to make trade liberalization the centerpiece of two important 
1994 summit meetings: the November meeting in Indonesia of the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the December '94 "Summit of the Americas" 
in Miami. In both cases, the United States and its trading partners agreed 
to phase out all trade barriers - by the year 2005 in the Americas and by the 
year 2020 in the Asia-Pacific region.

<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">I</FONT>ndex of <FONT SIZE = "+2">E</FONT>conomic

Just one day after The Heritage Foundation released its first-ever global report 
card on economic freedom, Sen. Mitch McConnell 
(R-KY), incoming Chairman of the Appropriations Committee's Foreign Operations 
Subcommittee, suggested major changes in America's $14 billion-per-year foreign 
aid program. As Heritage Vice President and Director of Foreign Policy and 
Defense Studies Kim Holmes told reporters at a Dec. 16 media briefing, most 
U.S. development aid is being given to countries "that don't deserve it" because 
their state-controlled economies will waste it. Countries with free economies, 
he noted, generally don't need U.S. aid. 
<P>


<P>
Earlier in the week, Holmes had said in a Wall Street Journal op-ed page article 
that "People in Angola, Haiti, Mozambique and Ukraine are not poor because 
wealthy people in the West haven't been generous toward them." They are poor, 
he said, because their governments' "misguided economic policies" retard economic 
growth and prosperity.
<P>

<P>

This long-overdue debate over U.S. foreign-aid policy was precipitated  by 
the publication of "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/indx.html">The Index of Economic Freedom</a>," a 258-page comparative 

analysis compiled by Heritage's <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan Johnson</a> and Thomas Sheehy.  Released on Dec. 12, the "Index" examines the economies of 101 countries. As Investor's 
Business Daily noted, Heritage created the "Index," which is similar to Freedom 
House's annual country-by-country survey of political freedom, "to help U.S. 
and international policy-makers better craft their aid policies. If aid money 
is given to a country that is following poor economic policies, the chances 
are good it will be wasted or do little, if any, good."

 

<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">A</FONT>sian <FONT SIZE = "+2">S</FONT>tudies 
<FONT SIZE = "+2">C</FONT>enter</H3></CENTER>

Not surprisingly, four of the ten countries with the best ratings on Heritage's 
"Index of Economic Freedom" - and eight of the top 20 - were from the Asia-Pacific 
region. When the United States, Canada, and Chile are included - all of which 
belong to the 18-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) - the 
more broadly defined region boasts 11 of the 20 freest economies in the world. 
The APEC nations also now account for 40 percent of all global trade.
<P>

<P>

In recognition of the growing importance of the Asia-Pacific community, The 
Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center was established in 1983. Today, 
the Center is recognized on both sides of the Pacific as one of the most important 
research and policy centers on diplomatic, economic, and security issues affecting 
the United States and Asia.
<P>
While trade and security issues dominated the calendar, Director <a href="/heritage/staff/przystup.htm">James Przystup</a> 
and the Asian Studies Center staff made a strong case in 1994 for significantly 
upgrading U.S. relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan, a booming country 
of more than 20 million people that continues to be treated as a second-class 
world citizen by the United States. Visiting Fellow Daryl Plunk and Richard 
V. Allen, National Security Advisor to President Reagan and Chairman of the 
Asian Studies Center's Advisory Council, provided Washington with much-needed 
guidance on defusing the growing crisis over North Korea's nuclear-weapons 
program. And Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/oquinn.htm">Robert O'Quinn</a> offered the White House an agenda 
for the mid-November APEC summit, proposing that leaders of the 18 member countries 
set a "time certain" for establishing a trans-Pacific free-trade area, the 
topic of an Oct. 27 Asian Studies Center conference featuring Nancy Adams, 
U.S. Trade Representative for APEC Affairs, and Paula Stern, former Chairwoman 
of the U.S. International Trade Commission.   
<P>

<P>

The Heritage-sponsored Washington Roundtable for the Asia-Pacific Press (WRAPP) 
hosted several "newsmaker" breakfasts during the year. Rep. Floyd Spence (R-SC), 
then ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, discussed the 
North Korean nuclear threat. Political analysts Victor Kamber, a liberal Democrat, 
 and Bradley O'Leary, a conservative Republican, discussed the congressional 
elections. And Heritage's <a href="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</a> discussed "The Index of Economic Freedom" 
and proposed changes in U.S. foreign aid policy. 
<P>
Important financial support for many of the Asian Studies Center's programs 
continues to be provided by the Korea Foundation Endowment for Korean Studies. 


  

<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">R</FONT>ussian <FONT SIZE = "+2">R</FONT>eform</H3></CENTER>

Russian political scientist Evgueni Volk was appointed coordinator of the Heritage 
Foundation's Moscow Office in 1994, succeeding Senior Fellow Jeffrey Gayner, 
who had directed the office since its opening in 1993. 
<P>
Heritage's Moscow office is now seen in Russia as a neutral meeting ground 
where reformers can work out their public differences in private. This is done 
through the Heritage Reform Forum, a monthly "summit" meeting of Moscow's leading 
reform politicians, businessmen, and journalists.    
<P>
The Moscow Office also is involved in more traditional policy analysis. Volk 
and Salvatori Fellow in Russian and Eurasian Studies Ariel Cohen distribute 
draft legislation being considered by the Russian parliament to experts in 
the United States, Europe, and Russia. Comments and suggestions are then sent 
to members of the parliament and appropriate staff. During 1994, legislation 
on defense, "peacekeeping" operations, lobbying, and non-governmental organizations 
was refined in this way.

<P>
If not dishonest, Washington's traditional misuse of numbers certainly is misleading. 
The use of a technical device known as "baseline budgeting" has enabled policy-makers 
for 20 years to claim spending reductions while increasing spending. Everything, 
it seems - from omnibus spending bills to the budget reconciliation process 
- has been intended to hide from the public the true cost of Washington's actions. 
Just what does a $260 billion tax increase mean to the average family or the 
typical community?
<P>


The Heritage Foundation can now provide the answers. Thanks to a major half-million-dollar 
technical upgrade of our computer-analysis capabilities, Heritage's Roe Institute 
for Economic Policy Studies can now provide - overnight, if necessary - the 
kind of "hard numbers" and statistical analysis that can change the course 
of debate. Over and over again in 1994 - on the crime bill, on the flood of 
health-care reform plans that threatened to overwhelm Capitol Hill, on the 
fiscal year 1995 budget - Heritage showed that its data-analysis capabilities 
now rival those of the Congressional Budget Office and Office of Management 
and Budget. But that's not all; as often as possible, Heritage analysts attempted 
to make the numbers understandable, showing how various policy proposals would 
impact individual businesses, workers, families, and the cities and states 
where they live.

Endowed by The Roe Foundation of Greenville, S.C., and other supporters, the 
Roe Institute staff specializes in budget and tax issues, the effects of regulation 
on the economy, environmental policy, competitiveness, and trade. Recommendations 
in 1994 included a call for a $500-per-child tax credit, repeal of the Social 
Security earnings tax, and reduction and indexation of the capital gains tax. 
The Roe Institute staff also identified numerous wasteful and inefficient government 
programs that should be cut back or eliminated and helped convince lawmakers 
of the merits of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). And, of 
course, they continued to argue persuasively for a balanced budget amendment 
to the Constitution, which became a major component of the House GOP's "Contract 
with America."

Heritage's popular prosperity plan for America, called "Putting Families First," 
served as the basis for the alternative budget offered by House and Senate 
Republicans in 1994. While the plan, written by <a href="/heritage/s
taff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a>, Heritage's Grover 
M. Hermann Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs, fell short in the 103rd Congress, 
most of its components were included in the "Contract with America."  
<P>



<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">R</FONT>egulatory <FONT SIZE = "+2">R</FONT>eform</H3></CENTER>

Roe Institute analysts also focused in 1994 on the regulatory burden placed 
on the economy, environmental policies that threaten private-property rights, 
and "unfunded mandates" - regulations the federal government imposes on businesses 
and state and local governments without paying for them. Among the most widely 
quoted studies published during the year was then Deputy Director Susan Eckerly's 
first-ever "Citizen's Guide to Regulation," which illustrated the real damage 
overzealous federal bureaucrats can do to the economy, businesses, and individuals.

<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">H</FONT>ealth-<FONT SIZE = "+2">C</FONT>are 
<FONT SIZE = "+2">R</FONT>eform</H3></CENTER>

The expertise built up over five years of intensive research, aided by new 
data-processing capabilities, enabled Heritage's health-policy experts, headed 
by <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Stuart
Butler</a>, Vice President and Director, Domestic Policy Studies, and 
Deputy Director <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert Moffit</a>, to play a significant role in the defeat of 
government-controlled health care in 1994. After providing Congress and the 
media with a wealth of material showing why the Clinton health-care plan would 
be a disaster, the Heritage analysts produced more than a dozen papers during 
a three-week summer period analyzing in detail the many alternative plans that 
flooded the marketplace after the collapse of the Clinton plan. The result: 
Any hope of placing one-seventh of the U.S. economy under the control of the 
federal government vanished.
<P>
Meanwhile, Heritage continued to argue that the best way to reform health care 
is to de-link health insurance from the workplace so individuals can own their 
own health policies and have a direct stake in their cost. This idea was the 
model for the Consumer Choice Health Security Act, sponsored in the 103rd Congress 
by Sen. Don Nickles (R-OK) and Rep. Cliff Stearns (R-FL). 
<P>

Even as Heritage Welfare and Family Issues Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a> was exposing 
President Clinton's welfare-reform plan as another expansion of the welfare 
state, Cultural Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a> was helping focus the nation's 
attention on the connection between the startling rise in illegitimate births 
and other social pathologies, such as crime and failure in school. In both 
the House and Senate, 1994 saw the introduction of legislation based on Rector's 
research and recommendations. Many of these same ideas - such as banning increased 
benefits for unwed mothers under age 21 who have additional children, requiring 
welfare recipients to work for their benefits, and putting an overall cap on 
welfare spending - were included in the House GOP's "Contract with America."

Also in 1994, Heritage Distinguished Fellow in Cultural Policy Studies <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William 
Bennett</a>'s "Index of Leading Cultural Indicators" was updated, expanded, and 
published as a quality paperback by Touchstone Books, a division of Simon and 
Schuster. Americans now have at their fingertips the information they need 
to monitor long-term trends in America's social health. Bennett's "The Book 
of Virtues," meanwhile, remained on The New York Times bestseller list throughout 
the year.

Foundation!</a>
<p>
The Heritage Foundation received another vote of confidence from its members 
and donors in 1994:  For the 21st consecutive year, income from contributions 
was up - to an all-time record of $21.5 million - as was Heritage's influence 
and impact.
<p>
With more than 200,000 individual, foundation, and corporate supporters, The 
Heritage Foundation remains the most broadly supported research institute in 
the United States. Of the $25.5 million in total income - a 12 percent increase 
over 1993 ($22.9 million) - 50 percent was provided by individuals, 25 percent 
by foundations, and 9 percent by business contributors.
<P>
But Heritage members and supporters do more than write checks: They receive 
Heritage publications, attend meetings, visit with Heritage representatives, 
and learn about the issues of the day. Heritage's members fuel the institution's 
success in two ways: They provide the financial resources needed for Heritage 
to do its job in Washington, and many of them take the knowledge they gain 
through their personal involvement with Heritage back to their local communities.
<P>


Since its founding in 1973, Heritage has made it a firm policy to accept no 
government funding, perform no contract work, and maintain no political or 
academic affiliations. All contributions are voluntary and tax deductible under 
Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. This enables Heritage to maintain 
its independence; it also means that Heritage's officers and staff must earn 
the trust of members and supporters each year.
<P>

Most Heritage donors are motivated by two things: They agree with the conservative 
principles upon which Heritage's work is based, and they believe The Heritage 
Foundation uses their money wisely. Said one President's Club member, "If it 
weren't for ... The Heritage Foundation, I would despair for our country. You 
give me a reason for optimism." Added a corporate Executive Committee Member, 
"The Heritage Foundation has earned a reputation as an incubator of ideas ... 
[that] foster democracy, free enterprise and political freedom. We remain convinced 
that there are ample returns on our investment in Heritage and believe the 
important work of The Heritage Foundation needs to continue." And a Heritage 
Associate put it this way: "As our government becomes more oppressive and as 
our culture deteriorates look increasingly to Heritage for solutions. Keep 
up the good work."
<P>
Heritage strives to involve its supporters in the war of ideas in a number 
of ways.  During 1994, the Heritage staff held more than 400 one-on-one meetings 
with individual, foundation, and corporate donors to hear their views and to 
report on Heritage accomplishments. Heritage publications provide another avenue 
of communications. Heritage Members News, published quarterly, is distributed 
to all  200,000 members; members of the President's Club, Associates, and Founder-level 
donors also receive Heritage studies. Regular programs and events for donors 
featuring presentations by policymakers and Heritage experts include the following:

<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">F</FONT>ounders</H3></CENTER>

Heritage Founders are those individuals, foundations, and corporations who 
provide $100,000 or more during the year to The Heritage Foundation.  In 1994, 
30 donors gave at the Founders level. Founders are invited to the Annual Board 
Meeting and Public Policy Seminar and to a special Founders briefing at Heritage. 
Those who attended the 1994 briefing, held on  December 7, were able to talk 
shop with Heritage Distinguished Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a>; William Kristol, Chairman 
of the Project for the Republican Future; Vin Weber, Vice Chairman of Empower 
America; and Michael Joyce, President of the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation.
<P>


<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">H</FONT>eritage <FONT SIZE = "+2">A</FONT>ssociates</H3></CENTER>

Heritage Associates, those who give $10,000 or more, are invited, along with 
Heritage Trustees and Founders, to participate in Heritage's Annual  Board 
Meeting and Public Policy Seminar. The 1994 meeting, the ninth in this series, 
was held in Amelia Island, FL, in April. Featured speakers were Distinguished 
Fellows William Bennett and <a href="/heritage/staff/kemp.htm">Jack Kemp</a>, Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler, author 
and Heritage Trustee Midge Decter, and author Charles Murray. Rep. Tillie Fowler 
(R-FL), who represents the northeastern Florida district in which Amelia Island 
lies, welcomed the more than 150 guests.

With the future Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, as the lead-off speaker, 
the Nov. 15 President's Club meeting was the largest in the program's 12-year 
history. The day-long event attracted more than 500 Heritage friends and supporters 
for a series of discussions on Washington's political reordering. In his speech, 
"What the Elections Mean to Conservatives," Gingrich said, "There are changes 
we have to make, and we badly need The Heritage Foundation's help intellectually 
in understanding how to make them." Dinner speaker Jack Kemp focused on Heritage's 
pivotal role as the idea factory for the conservative revolution.
<P>

Representative Gingrich also was the keynote speaker at Heritage's May President's 
Club meeting. Other speakers at the meeting included Rep. Tim Hutchinson (R-AR) 
and, at the Executive Committee luncheon, Rep. Jennifer Dunn (R-WA).

<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">P</FONT>hysician's <FONT SIZE = "+2">C</FONT>ouncil</H3></CENTER>

Health care issues dominated public policy in 1994.  With many medical doctors 
feeling excluded from the health-care debate, Heritage Chairman David R. Brown, 
M.D.,  started the Physician's Council. The inaugural meeting, in June, featured 
Sens. Don Nickles (R-OK) and Connie Mack (R-FL), co-sponsors of the Consumer 
Choice Health Security Act, and Bernadine Healy, former Director of the National 
Institutes of Health.  A second meeting of the Physician's Council was held 
in conjunction with the November President's Club meeting.  Nearly 700 doctors 
had joined the Council by year end.

<FONT SIZE = "+2">S</FONT>eminars</H3></CENTER>

Issues and ideas also were on the agenda at two regional policy seminars held 
in 1994: July 18 in Monterey, CA, where Jack Kemp's keynote address focused 
on the need to make U.S. interests the centerpiece of American foreign policy, 
and March 8 in Palm Beach, FL, where the focus was health care and crime.
<P>

<P>

In addition to these two half-day regional meetings, Distinguished Fellow Bill 
Bennett and Heritage Vice President <a href="/heritage/staff/vonkan.htm">John Von Kannon</a> spoke to 150 supporters 
and others at a luncheon in St. Louis, and Von Kannon addressed a meeting of 
Heritage members in Harbor Springs, MI.

1994 saw continued growth in the Windsor Society, a special group of dedicated 
Heritage Members who contribute to the Heritage Foundation's long-range financial 
objectives through their estate plans or other planned gifts. In 1994, twenty-nine 
Heritage members made commitments to Heritage totaling more than $3.5 million. 
These generous gifts will ensure that there will always be a principled conservative 
institution in Washington fighting for free enterprise, limited government, 
traditional American values, and a strong national defense. 

In February 1994, the eighth meeting of the Windsor Society was held at the 
Biltmore Hotel in Scottsdale, AZ. The three-day conference focused on the crucial 
battle over health care that was unfolding in Washington. Heritage experts 
and more than 40 Heritage members discussed the importance of the health care 
debate in terms of America's future. Presentations on estate planning were 
also available to interested Heritage members, not only to support their deeply 
held conservative beliefs, but also to assist them and their families in their 
financial planning.  
<P>
The Windsor Society continues to help build the future financial support Heritage 
will need to continue fighting well into the 21st century for the values and 
principles which built America.

Heritage's more than 200,000 individual, foundation, and corporate supporters 
in 1994 included:
<P>
30 Founders - donors of $100,000 or more, who provided Heritage with more 
than $6.9 million in contributions in 1994;
<P>
112 Associates - donors of at least $10,000 but less than $100,000, who provided 
$2.4 million in support in 1994;
<P>
282 members of the President's Club Executive Committee - donors of at least 
$2,500 but less than $10,000, who provided Heritage with $800,000 in 1994;
<P>
1,207 President's Club members - donors of $1,000 or more who  provided $1.2 
million.
<P>
Heritage's 5,100 Congress Watchers, $100 and above donors who help finance 
Heritage's U.S. Congress Assessment Project, provided some $500,000 in support 
in 1994, and Heritage's more than 200,000 individual members provided some 
$9.6 million.

<CENTER><B>Wow, What a Year!</B></CENTER>
<P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<p>
Early on the morning of November 9, 1994, as I sat contemplating the "tsunami," 
or shock wave, that the national elections had unleashed on official Washington, 
I noticed a copy of "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/imp.html">The Imperial Congress</a>" in my bookcase, a book which Heritage 
published in 1988.
<P>
In the Foreword to that book, a young Georgia Congressman wrote, "Every citizen 
should be concerned about the arrogance and corruption of the present day Congress. 
 At stake is the liberty of the American public. must reform Congress to make 
it truly representative once again."
<P>
Newt Gingrich had it right. And on Nov. 8, millions of Americans expressed 
that concern at the ballot box by sending to Washington and the statehouses 
and legislatures of America an army of lawmakers dedicated to reforming Congress 
and finishing the conservative revolution Ronald Reagan began in 1980.
<P>
The following week, at the largest President's Club meeting in Heritage's history, 
that same Georgia Congressman gave one of his first public addresses as the 
future Speaker of  the U.S. House of Representatives - the first Republican 
speaker in 40 years. "Heritage," Gingrich said, "is without question the most 
far-reaching conservative organization in the country in the war of  ideas, 
and one which has had a tremendous impact not just in Washington, but literally 
across the planet."
<P>

California Gov. Pete Wilson, three days later, also visited us at Heritage, 
giving a major national address on the ways in which liberalism had distorted 
the relationship between the state and federal governments. Governor Wilson, 
who had spoken earlier in the year at a meeting of our Governors' Forum,  described 
Heritage "as an island of clear thinking and common sense amid the fuzzy-headed 
liberalism of Washington.  Here at Heritage you have long been champions of 
the idea of limited government in order to expand individual opportunity, an 
idea that was at the heart of last week's ballot box rebellion."
<P>
The impact of all this really hit home a week later when Harvard's Kennedy 
School of Government canceled the orientation program it had been holding for 
newly elected members of Congress since 1972. The reason?  Lack of interest: 
Most members of Congress's Class of 1994 had decided to attend the Heritage 
Foundation/Empower America orientation conference. As Harvard's hometown newspaper, 
the liberal Boston Globe, said in a major article, "In the capricious business 
of supplying politicians with academic expertise and advice, if Harvard's star 
is fading, The Heritage Foundation's is surely on the ascent."
<P>

<p>
What a month November was. What a year!

<P>
The important thing to remember is that all of this didn't just happen.  Just 
as Heritage drew up the battle plan for the first conservative insurgency against 
Washington's liberal fortress with our "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/mnd2.html">Mandate for Leadership</a>" series, we 
also have had a major role in fashioning the new conservative agenda.  Heritage 
welcomed 1994 with "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/issu.html">Issues '94</a>," first-of-its-kind briefing book for congressional 
candidates. "Issues '94" provided comprehensive data on a dozen key national 
issues, from federal spending and defense policy to congressional reform.
<P>
Later in the year our analysts were asked for their input on the House GOP 
leadership's proposal to do the unthinkable: tell the American voters where 
they stand on the important issues of the day. The result was the "Contract 
with America." 
<P>
This was followed by still another major set of recommendations for the the 
conservative 104th Congress, "The New Member's Guide to the Issues."
<P>
As New York's Village Voice, one of the bellwethers of counterculture liberalism, 
said of the new conservative agenda: "The driving force behind this conservative 
program is the Heritage Foundation, which over the last decade has occupied 
center stage as the preeminent think tank in Washington .... Heritage was the 
architect of the attack on the New Deal Congress, and has been an important 
force in developing the assault on the liberal-minded federal civil service, 
the drive for privatization, and the overall philosophy of free market economics."
<P>

<P>
All of this was accomplished as the men and women of Heritage went about a 
range of activities that made 1994 the single most productive year in our 21-year 
history. We developed "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/indx.html">The Index of Economic Freedom</a>," which already is redefining 
the U.S. foreign aid debate; produced a comprehensive tax-relief and deficit-reduction 
plan, "Putting Families First," which became the official alternative budget 
of congressional Republicans in 1994; provided much of the intellectual ammunition 
that led to the demise of health-care "reforms" that would have put the federal 
government in charge of the trillion-dollar U.S. health-care system; played 
a major role in the GATT debate; exposed the crime bill as little more than 
another pork-laden social-spending bill; crafted a welfare reform plan that 
would truly "end welfare as we know it"; began work on a major study of agriculture 
policy, with publication timed for the 1995 debate on the farm bill; and launched 
a new institution-wide program, the American Trader Initiative, to push for 
a liberalized trade policy that dramatically increases international business 
opportunities.          
<P>

Clearly, 1994 was a banner year in terms of  policy development. But there 
was much more:
<P>
... Heritage military analysts, in a series of studies examining the administration's 
defense budget, found that the administration had underfunded its own defense 
plan more than $100 billion over five years.
<P>
... Distinguished Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William J. Bennett</a>, one of the country's leading voices 
on cultural policy and a  featured speaker at our April Board Meeting & Public 
Policy Seminar, saw his "The Book of Virtues" stay at the top of the national 
bestseller lists. Touchstone Books, meanwhile, published an expanded and updated 
version of Bennett's landmark Heritage study, "The Index of Leading Cultural 
Indicators." 
<P>
... A seminal study by Heritage Senior Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a>, chronicling 
the terrible consequences to children and society of out-of-wedlock births, 
sent shockwaves across the country, adding a new sense of urgency to the continuing 
debate over welfare reform.
<P>
... We also released the second edition of "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/safe.html">A Safe and Prosperous America</a>," 
which remains the only comprehensive conservative blueprint for post-Cold War 
foreign and defense policy.
<P>
... The Washington Roundtable for the Asia-Pacific Press (WRAPP) was re-established 
under Heritage's sponsorship; and
<P>
... A record 130 organizations joined us at Heritage's 17th Annual <a href="/heritage/resource_bank/rtoc.html">Resource 
Bank</a> Meeting.
<P>
Major advances in our computer capabilities, meanwhile, provided Heritage analysts 
with a powerful new analytical tool rivaling that of the government itself. 
For example: Using our computer model, Heritage analysts were able to measure 
the impact of health-care proposals on businesses, workers, families, and the 
states.
<P>
In addition to the vastly expanded computer capabilities, we also upgraded 
our radio broadcast facilities, enabling talk show hosts to air their programs 
live from Heritage's studios on Capitol Hill. And our magazine, <a href="/heritage/p_review/welcome.html">Policy Review</a>, 
continued to grow, reaching another circulation milestone - 30,000. As Boston 
Globe columnist David Warsh wrote, "No magazine has been more vivid in conveying 
the cultural breadth and depth of the conservative imagination."
<P>
These are just a few of the highlights from an incredibly productive, whirlwind 
year. Heritage also remained one of Washington's leading policy forums, with 
dozens of  lectures, seminars, and debates filling our Lehrman Auditorium and 
Van Andel Conference Center.

<P>
As you know, when The Heritage Foundation was first established in 1973 we 
made a conscious decision to be different from Washington's other "think tanks." 
 Our goal - then, as now - was to have an impact on the national public policy 
debate, not just publish research papers and host conferences. To do this, 
we identified target markets in the Congress, the administration, and the news 
media and then designed our research product to meet the needs of the marketplace. 

<P>
Today we are a permanent Washington institution. But we still pride ourselves 
on our originality and inventiveness; on steering the debate, not just responding 
to it. 
<P>
What enables us to do this?  Our people - who are among the chief intellectual 
resources of Washington's new conservative establishment.
<P>
During 1994, we made several important changes in our management team. <a href="/heritage/staff/gaynerl.htm">Lew 
Gayner</a> was named Vice President for External Relations and will oversee Heritage's 
outreach to the business community, conservative policy organizations, and 
the nation's governors. <a href="/heritage/staff/przystup.htm">James Przystup</a>, a former Defense Department official 
and a Japan specialist, was named Director of our Asian Studies Center. Bridget 
Wagner, a 13-year Heritage veteran, was named Director of Business Relations. 
And Margaret Bonilla, a seven-year Heritage veteran, was named Director of 
Development.
<P>
Notable staff additions included <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a>, Deputy Assistant Secretary 
of Health and Human Services during the Bush administration, who was named 
Senior Policy Analyst, and <a href="/heritage/staff/winston.htm">David Winston</a>, who joined us as Senior Fellow in 
Statistical Policy Analysis.  
<P>
With sadness we note the passing of three giants of the conservative movement: 
Dr. Russell Kirk, a long-time Heritage Distinguished Scholar, lecturer, critic, 
conscience of the conservative movement, and author of dozens of books,  including 
"The Conservative Mind"; Dr. Walter Judd, conservative leader, American patriot, 
recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and a dedicated member of The 
Heritage Foundation; and Shelby Cullom Davis, the New York investment banker 
and former Ambassador to Switzerland who served with great distinction as Heritage's 
long-time Board Chairman. The memory of these three great Americans will live 
on at Heritage, as will the impact they had on America and the world.
<P>
While we continue to take great pride in our work, we realize that it is possible 
only because of the continued generous support of our donors. We thank them, 
sincerely. In 1994, income topped $25.5 million, most of it coming from the 
200,000 individuals, foundations, and businesses that comprise the Heritage 
family.
<P>


<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">T</FONT>he <FONT SIZE = "+2>F</FONT>uture</H3></CENTER>
<P>
What about 1995 and beyond? Conservatives have spent the past 20 years building 
a broad network of institutions dedicated to common-sense government  - think 
tanks, state-based research organizations, public interest law groups, radio 
talk shows, on-line computer networks, even a conservative television network 
(soon to be joined by one or more others).  With these institutions solidly 
in place we got our message out. It was heard and understood. 
<P>
Heritage will play a very active role in shaping the new Washington. Our agenda 
 includes reductions in taxes and federal spending - including the elimination 
of several government departments, agencies, programs, and functions - welfare 
and entitlement reform, a revival of federalism, de-regulation of the economy, 
restoring defense readiness, protecting the United States against possible 
missile attack, stopping the spread of global terrorism, and re-examining U.S. 
foreign aid. 
<P>
We are starting an exciting journey that should result in a major change in 
the relationship between the American people and their government. All of us 
at Heritage look forward to being a part of this promising new chapter in American 
history.

Ideas count - and the best way to express ideas remains the written word. Heritage 
offered Washington lots of words in 1994,  publishing more than 250 books, 
monographs, and policy studies. The papers ranged from brief commentaries to 
5,000-to-10,000-word "Backgrounders" and lengthier monographs, such as 
"<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/issu.html">Issues 
'94: The Candidate's Briefing Book</a>," "A Citizen's Guide to Regulation," and 
"
"<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/indx.html">The Index of Economic Freedom</a>," a 1995 publication released in December. Regular 
newsletters included "Heritage Today" and  "Heritage Members News," featuring 
information about Heritage Foundation people and activities; "The Insider," 
reporting on publications and activities of Resource Bank groups; "Business/Education 
Insider," focusing on the role of business in education reform; and "Reforming 
Congress: Changing the Way Washington Works," which kept a watchful eye on 
the wayward Congress.
<P>
While Heritage research papers are provided free of charge to the policy-making 
community, there is great demand beyond that. In addition to printed copies, 
most Heritage policy studies also are available electronically on the NEXIS 
data-retrieval system and <a href="http://www.townhall.com">Town Hall</a>, the conservative computer network co-owned 
by Heritage and National Review. Town Hall operates as a private forum on CompuServe. 
Some Heritage publications are available additionally on audiotape. 

<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">P</FONT>olicy <FONT SIZE = "+2">R</FONT>eview</H3></CENTER>

Heritage's flagship publication is <a href="/heritage/p_review/welcome.html">Policy Review</a>. Sprightly and unpredictable, 
Policy Review reached an all-time high in paid circulation in 1994: 30,000, 
a 30 percent  increase over the previous year. 
<p>
Policy Review's impact, however, continued to exceed its circulation. The summer 
issue, for example, featured a prescient article, "Flanagan's Island: How Boys 
Town Rescues Troubled Teens." Following the GOP sweep in November's congressional 
elections, Boys Town became a symbol for the kind of "tough love" proposed 
in the GOP's welfare-reform plan. The spring issue featured an article by Houston 
constable Victor Trevino, "Zebra Territory: The Courage of Houston's Volunteer 
Cops." A Mexican immigrant, Trevino told how he has organized volunteer patrols 
in his district, cutting truancy in half and crime by 10 percent without increasing 
taxes. The fall issue featured a headline-making article by  Rush Limbaugh: 
"Voice of America: Why Liberals Fear Me."  Excerpts appeared in the Sunday 
Los Angeles Times and dozens of other newspapers. The talk-radio phenomenon 
had been explored earlier in the year in "The Gurus of Gab," a lively symposium 
featuring 10 of America's top talkers. Among the prominent political figures 
with 1994 Policy Review bylines were Rep. Dick Armey (R-TX); Sen. Phil Gramm 
(R-TX); Rep. Henry Hyde (R-IL); and Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler.

<CENTER><B>Popularizing Conservative Ideas</B></CENTER><P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>


<P>
On Nov. 8, 1994, a conservative tide swept across America - opening a new chapter 
in the political revolution launched by President Reagan 14 years earlier.
<P>
The White House, national news media, and Washington's liberal establishment 
were surprised by both the depth and the breadth of the conservative victory. 
They were even more surprised, however, by something else: that the voters 
both understood and supported the ideas proposed during the campaign by conservative 
candidates. 
<P>
They shouldn't have been surprised. Many of the specific proposals had been 
developed at The Heritage Foundation, and almost all of them had been time-tested 
in the court of public opinion: in speeches to business and civic groups, in 
congressional Town Hall meetings, in op-ed page articles, and on talk radio. 
Maybe the Washington establishment didn't appreciate the common-sense appeal 
of the conservative policy agenda, but the voters did.
<P>
Since 1973, The Heritage Foundation has served a dual role: both as an idea 
factory and as a product-testing laboratory. The first role - policy research, 
development, and innovation - is the purpose of Heritage's ongoing research 
program. The equally important second role of popularizing and legitimizing 
Heritage Foundation policy prescriptions and the broader conservative vision 
of government is the mandate of Heritage's marketing program. 
<P>
This emphasis on marketing to Congress and the Executive Branch, the national 
and international news media, state government officials, and the business, 
academic, and policy communities is one of the things that makes Heritage different 
from other policy institutes. As a USA Today headline put it in a post-election 
feature about Heritage, "The Think Tank: Foundation bringing vision back to 
the future."
<p>


<P>

<P>
On November 21, two weeks after the election, Harvard University's John F. 
Kennedy School of Government announced it had cancelled its "Introduction to 
Congress" class in December. The Ivy League university had held the course 
for newly elected members of Congress for 22 years.  In 1994, there wasn't 
much interest in what the Harvard faculty might have to say. Instead, most 
congressional freshmen attended The Heritage Foundation's orientation program 
in Baltimore.
<P>
The Economist modestly called the change "a sign of the times." Earlier in 
the year, in its Jan. 7, 1994, issue, The Economist had forecast such a shift. 
"In the 1960s it looked as if universities would establish a monopoly over 
the life of the mind, providing policies for politicians, sinecures for writers, 
ideas for journalists and breakthroughs for industrialists." The 1980s, The 
Economist observed, "changed all that." Now, the editors wrote, governments 
in search of advice increasingly look "to think tanks such as the Institute 
of Economic Affairs in Britain and the Heritage Foundation in Washington, rather 
than to Oxford or Harvard." 
<P>

From the beginning, Congress - which has the constitutional authority to pass 
laws, ratify treaties, declare war, and approve spending - has been Heritage's 
primary audience. The government relations staff serves as an institutional 
link between the Heritage research team and the policymaking community, providing 
Congress and the Executive Branch with timely information and policy recommendations 
on matters of current interest.
<P>
<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">C</FONT>andidate <FONT SIZE = "+2">E</FONT>ducation</H3></CENTER>
<P>
With an important national election ahead, Heritage welcomed the 1994 political 
season with its 296-page candidates' briefing book, "Issues '94." The book 
was distributed free of charge to incumbents and challengers alike.  
<P>
Dozens of House and Senate candidates and several gubernatorial candidates, 
including George Pataki, who unseated New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, used the briefing 
book. As one successful congressional challenger, Ron Lewis (R-KY), wrote, 
"Heritage provided the best, most accurate facts and figures that I used in 
my campaign. They were right on target every time."
<P>

<P>

Heritage's efforts to provide policy guidance to future members of the 104th 
Congress didn't cease with the election. Most successful candidates had promised 
to challenge the status quo and cut Washington down to size. The three-day 
orientation conference offered by Heritage and Empower America provided a game 
plan for doing just that, with sessions on family tax relief, federal mandates 
and federalism, farm policy reform, fighting crime, congressional reform, health 
care, foreign policy, welfare reform, rebuilding America's defenses, the environmental 
activists' "green agenda," and cutting government. addition to the many Heritage 
analysts on the program, the list of speakers included Heritage Distinguished 
Fellows <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/kemp.htm">Jack Kemp</a>, Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-WY),  Rep. W.J. 
"Billy" Tauzin (D-LA), Virginia Secretary of Natural Resources Becky Norton 
Dunlop, Kemper Financial Services Senior Economist John Silvia, John DiIulio 
of The Brookings Institution, Rep. Cal Dooley (D-CA), former U.S. Ambassador 
to the United Nations Jeane Kirkpatrick, and talk show superstar Rush Limbaugh, 
who was named an "Honorary Member" of the 104th Congress's freshman class.

<P>
Seven years of intense, focused effort which included two landmark books and 
dozens of articles, papers, and seminars was rewarded in 1994 as House Republicans 
embraced most of the institutional reforms proposed by Heritage's U.S. Congress 
Assessment Project staff.
<P>
The 1988 Heritage book, "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/imp.html">The Imperial Congress</a>," launched the debate. Something 
is terribly wrong with Congress, the book argued, and it needs to be fixed. 
As just one example, the book listed more than a dozen federal laws, including 
the National Labor Relations Act, Fair Labor Standards Act, Minimum Wage Act, 
Civil Rights Act of 1964, Freedom of Information Act, Occupational Safety and 
Health Act, Equal Employment Opportunity Act, and Ethics in Government Act, 
from which Congress had exempted itself.
<P>
All of the specific reforms approved by Congress on Jan. 4-5, 1995, can be 
found in the pages of "The Imperial Congress," the 1993 Heritage sequel, "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/imp.html">The 
Ruling Class</a>," or in the many papers produced in 1994 and prior years by David 
Mason and the "Congress Project" staff. For example, at the top of House Speaker 
Newt Gingrich's list of reforms was a promise, spelled out in the "Contract 
with America," to make "all laws that apply to the rest of the country also 
apply equally to the Congress." The new majority also moved to reduce the number 
of congressional committees and subcommittees, cut committee staff, limit the 
terms of committee chairs, open committee meetings to the public, and eliminate 
the phony "baseline budgeting" scam, which for years had allowed Washington 
to act as if it were cutting spending when it really was increasing it.
<P>

<P>
Heritage's Governors' Forum continued its efforts in 1994 to involve governors 
and state administrators more directly in federal policy decisions affecting 
their states. With the new Congress promising to return many government functions 
to the states, the program in 1995 will increase its emphasis on the concept 
of federalism.
<P>

<P>
Just two years old, the program already is seen as a major national forum. 
California Gov. Pete Wilson, for example, appeared at Heritage just days after 
his come-from-behind reelection. Seen by some as the start of a potential 1996 
presidential bid, his hard-hitting speech addressed the imbalance between state 
and federal government and how state executives can help take back some of 
the powers wrongly assumed by Washington. Other Governors' Forum speakers in 
1994 included former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, Virginia Gov. George Allen 
Jr., and Mississippi Gov. Kirk Fordice.

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<B><h2><I><center>What's The Cost?</B></I></center></h2>
<hr>
<P>

That question is immediately asked by every member of the Congress
who considers tax legislation.  Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
IRA legislation is certainly no exception, because the words &quot;universal,&quot;
&quot;unlimited,&quot; and &quot;tax-deductible&quot; invoke the
prospect of a large &quot;cost.&quot;
<P>
Congressional policy makers' thinking in these terms is encouraged
by the treatment of tax provisions like IRAs in the government's
so-called Tax Expenditure Budget.  Estimates prepared by the staff
of the Joint Committee on Taxation of the tax expenditures (i.e.,
&quot;costs,&quot; in the vernacular of Congress) for various
&quot;Income Security&quot; budget functions are shown in the
following table.  By precedent or rule, all members of Congress
use these figures as the basis for their legislative considerations.
<pre>
 				Year &amp; Billions of Dollars 
			----------------------------------------------------	
Net Exclusion of 						Total
Pension Contributions 	1994	1995	1996	1997	1998	'94-'98
&amp; Earnings
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Employer Plans 		55.3 	58.5 	62.0 	65.7 	69.6 	311.1

IRAs			6.2 	6.5 	7.0 	7.5 	8.0 	35.2

Keogh Plans 		3.0 	3.1	3.3 	3.5 	3.7 	16.6

* From Joint Committee Taxation Report
</pre>

The April 22, 1993, Joint Committee on Taxation report states that these
&quot;Tax expenditures are most similar to those direct <I>spending
programs</I> which have no spending limits, and which are available as
entitlements to those who meet the statutory criteria established for the
programs&quot; (emphasis added). Direct spending entitlement programs
include:  Social Security, railroad retirement, federal employees
retirement and insurance, unemployment assistance, Medicare, Medicaid,
veterans hospital care, housing, nutrition, public assistance programs,
etc. <P>

As previously discussed in this analysis, the tax expenditure figures
cited above are not &quot;spendings,&quot; regardless of the label used by
the staff.  And, in no way are net exclusions of pension contributions and
earnings &quot;most similar to direct spending programs&quot; such as
those listed in the paragraph above.  In reality, pension exclusions
result in &quot;tax deferrals&quot; (a government asset) upon which the
government receives a free-market rate of total return. <P>

Over three trillion dollars of &quot;qualified plan&quot; assets are now
held by various qualified plan trusts.  Those assets include the past
&quot;net exclusions,&quot; such as those cited in the table above. 
Because most of these assets were acquired by <I>new</I> saving undertaken
in response to the tax deferral, the various plans' aggregate tax
liability to the government with respect to those assets far exceeds the
directly-related government debt arising from the past net exclusions. 
This is particularly true of employer pension plans that generated huge
amounts of new saving over the years.  Over more recent years, however,
senseless and self-defeating funding constrictions imposed by Congress on
the plans have resulted in cut-backs and the abandonment of plans to the
great detriment of our economy. <P>

Regardless of the dollar magnitude of the &quot;tax expenditure&quot; that
the staff may estimate for universal IRAs, it must be recognized that not
a nickel of that amount is spent on consumption; every bit of it is
invested by the IRA owner in income-producing assets. If the average
taxpayers' tax bracket is 25%, for example, the total sum that's invested
in these IRAs will be four times the alleged tax expenditure.  Most of
that investment will be saving that wouldn't have been undertaken if the
universal IRA tax treatment hadn't been provided.  That's the greatest
thing that could happen to our nation's low rate of private saving.  As a
result thereof, our economy will expand dramatically, thereby providing
more production, more jobs, an increasing standard of living, and more
taxes. <P> In reality, contrary to the government's position that the
above &quot;exclusions&quot; are a cost, they should be viewed as a
working asset invested in free-market enterprise.  Thus, the larger the
aggregate tax deductions, the more positive are the prospective real
economic results.  <I>The government's disastrous perception of the
economic effects of tax-deferred saving faces 180 degrees in the wrong
direction!</I> <P> 

A few years ago a highly respected Washington, D.C., actuary (Paul H.
Jackson, FSA, The Wyatt Company), who specialized in pensions, wrote a
brief analysis of the government's methodology in determining pension tax
expenditures.  This analysis was published in the Newsletter of the
Society of Actuaries.  Mr. Jackson noted that within Congress, tax
expenditure figures are generally accepted as &quot;fact.&quot;  He also
noted that the largest single tax expenditure is the exclusion of pension
contributions, and investment income thereon, from the taxable income of
covered individuals.  Mr. Jackson concluded that &quot;...these tax
expenditure facts are conceptually flawed, arbitrary, and almost useless
for budget purposes.&quot;  He also concluded that &quot;...any tax law
based on such arbitrary and capricious figures can only be good by
accident.&quot; Mr. Jackson hit the nail on the head in precise, actuarial
fashion. 

<P>
<I>It is shocking that our government's fundamental tax policy,
as it relates to the vitally important fiscal element of tax-deferred
saving, rests upon analyses that are aptly described as being
&quot;arbitrary and capricious,&quot; and that produce legislation
that &quot;can only be good by accident.&quot;</I>

"This is Mike Rosen, KOA, Denver broadcasting live from the studios of The 
Heritage Foundation in Washington."
<P>
Those and similar words were heard frequently by talk-radio listeners around 
the country in 1994, following the opening of Heritage's new broadcast facilities. 
Equipped with state-of-the-art equipment, the studio enables talk-show hosts 
to do live broadcasts from Heritage's Capitol Hill headquarters.
<P>
Heritage already was becoming a "home away from home" for talk show hosts visiting 
the nation's capital, with live broadcasts during the year by Boston's Earl 
Jackson, Seattle's Dave Ross, and Richmond's Blanquita Walsh Cullum, among 
others. The remote broadcast facilities were opened to meet the growing demand. 
<P>

<P>
Heritage's work with talk radio, part of a broader broadcast media program, 
began several years ago - long before most other organizations realized the 
potential impact of this alternative communications medium.  
<P>
During 1994, Heritage experts made hundreds of guest appearances on radio talk 
shows, on  major television news and public affairs shows, and on the America's 
Talking, CNN, CNBC, C-SPAN, and National Empowerment Television (NET) call-in 
shows. Dozens of Heritage lectures and events also were seen on C-SPAN.  
<P>
The work with the broadcast media is just one facet of Heritage's wide-ranging 
communications program. Intended to familiarize political activists, opinion 
leaders, and the broader general public with the positive message of contemporary 
conservatism, the program also includes the Heritage Speakers Bureau, Heritage's 
pioneering "op-ed page" program, and a variety of other activities aimed at 
specialized audiences.
<P>
<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">O</FONT>pinion and <FONT SIZE = "+2">C</FONT>ommentary</H3></CENTER>

<P>
The op-ed page program provides Heritage analysts and executives with an opportunity 
to give their views on the important issues of the day without having to go 
through the usual news "filtering" process. During 1994, Heritage bylines appeared 
in hundreds of  U.S. and overseas newspapers, including the Wall Street Journal, 
Washington Post, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, Washington 
Times,  International Herald Tribune, USA Today, Buffalo News, Charlotte Observer, 
Oklahoma City Oklahoman, Orange County Register, and Pittsburgh Tribune Review. 
  <P>


Heritage also continued its relationship with Knight-Ridder/Tribune News Service, 
one of the largest supplemental newswires in the country, which distributes 
Heritage op-ed page essays every week as part of a <a href="/heritage/commentary/welcome.html">commentary</a> package.
<P>
<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">T</FONT>argeted <FONT SIZE = "+2">C</FONT>ommunications</H3></CENTER>
<P>
While most Heritage public relations activities involve the mass media, targeted 
communications also are important. 
<P>
The Speakers Bureau, for example, helped bring Heritage's conservative message 
to dozens of college campuses and business, professional, and civic organizations 
in 1994. While their primary focus remained  research, writing, and policy, 
Heritage analysts and executives met collectively with thousands of individuals 
around the country who had come to hear them speak. Among the many institutions 
providing Heritage speakers with a platform were the American Association of 
Colleges and Universities, American Society of Association Executives, Chautauqua 
Institution, Close Up Foundation, Colorado State University, and Grove City 
College, where Ed Feulner delivered the 1994 commencement address. Others included 
the Inter-American Defense College, National Petroleum Refiners Association, 
National Youth Leadership Forum, People to People, Rubber Manufacturers Association, 
St. Lawrence University, Texas A&M University, and World Affairs Council of 
Orange County. 
<P>

<P>

In addition to <a href="http://www.townhall.com/">Town Hall</a>, the "interactive" computer network co-owned by 
Heritage and National Review magazine, Heritage in 1994 was included in "Profnet," 
a national computer information network linking U.S. newsrooms with colleges 
and universities and a handful of think tanks around the country.
<P>
Heritage also continued to work closely in 1994 with Westcott Communications, 
a major publicly traded company that provides information and produces workplace 
training videos for corporate managers and executives in a number of specialized 
fields, including health care and financial management.
<P>


And Heritage successfully relaunched the Washington Roundtable for the Asia-Pacific 
Press (WRAPP). The organization, which had existed for several years in the 
1980s, is intended to help provide Washington-based Asian correspondents with 
better access to the Washington policymaking .

<B><h2><I><center>The U.S. Government's 1995 Budget Estimates Of The Costs
Of IRAs</B></I></h2></center>
<hr>
<P>
The U.S. government's 1995 Budget, for the first time ever, has
included discounted present-value estimates of revenue losses
for certain &quot;tax expenditures&quot; set forth elsewhere in
the Budget presentation (The 1995 Budget of the United States
Government-Analytical Perspectives, pages 59, 60, &amp; 61).
<P>
The government describes these present-value estimates as &quot;representing
the tax expenditure revenue losses, net of future tax payments.&quot;
The 1995 budget document explains that the tax deferrals on the
contributions, and on the accrued earnings thereon (i.e., tax
expenditures), will eventually be paid out upon an IRA withdrawal
when taxes will then be due.  Thus, these expected receipts are
included in these government present-value estimates.  The government
also points out that the discount rate used for the present-value
estimates is the interest rate on comparable maturity Treasury
debt.
<P>
Based upon the above, the government's 1995 Budget document presented
the following estimates for IRAs:
<P>
<pre>		1994 Tax Revenue Loss Estimates for IRAs
		----------------------------------------	
			(In Millions Of Dollars)

	Tax Expenditure 			$5,415 (a)

	Discounted Present-Value
 	Of The Above Tax Expenditure 		$1,735 (b)
</pre>

Based on the above figures, the &quot;present-value&quot; costs of IRAs (b
above) only equal 32% of the tax expenditure costs (a above) used by the
government in formulating tax policy. <P>

In view of the fact that the government recovers the full IRA tax
deduction with interest upon a withdrawal, the above present-value costs
(b above) reflect solely the cost arising from the &quot;second
layer&quot; of ordinary income tax (double taxation) that should not be
imposed in the first place (see pages 6 &amp; 7). <P>

Clearly, the government now admits that its alleged cost estimate for IRAs
in 1994 is not $5.4 billion, but 68% less, i.e., $1,735,000. <I>In effect,
the government admits by its own analysis that its alleged &quot;tax
expenditure&quot; costs for IRAs that are used in formulating tax
legislation are three times higher than they should be!<B> </B>($5.4
billion &#247; $1.7 billion = 3.18)</I>

<P> And even the above severely reduced alleged cost of $1.7 billion is
erroneous, because, as portrayed earlier in this analysis, the government
is assuming that all the saving in IRAs is old saving.  This means that
the government would have, if it had not been for the IRAs, collected its
&quot;second layer&quot; of tax.  This second layer of tax is an improper,
self-defeating form of taxation. 

<P> The government also ignores the fact that there is <I>no</I> cost to
the government if IRA contributions are <I>new</I> saving. Further, the
government calculation <I>omits</I> the dynamic economic gains from
tax-deductible IRAs that create more capital through increased saving,
thereby increasing production, creating more jobs, higher standards of
living, and yes-more taxes. 

<P> <I>The magnitude of the true costs to our nation's economy arising
from such erroneous tax revenue estimates is virtually beyond
comprehension.  It is shocking, scandalous, and worthy of imposed
investigation and correction.</I>

<B><h2><I><center>
Does It Really Matter How The Government Estimates The Revenue Gains And Losses From Changes In The Tax 
Laws?</h2></B></I></center>
<hr>
 <P>
Absolutely.  For example, in 1986 the government wanted more tax
revenue, so it effectively increased taxes on commercial real
estate.  Thus, investors' after-tax net rates of return on commercial
real estate were significantly reduced.  Naturally, and as a result,
real estate values and prices came tumbling down, leading to defaults
on mortgages, failed S &amp; Ls, failed banks, and jobs lost.
 Government bailouts (i.e., more taxpayer taxes) followed.
<P>
Every taxpayer has been severely damaged, directly or indirectly,
because of these ill-considered tax increases.  Far more tax revenue
and economic growth was lost (and will be lost) because of these
real estate tax increases than any related revenue gain estimated
by the government in 1986.
<P>
And, of course, there was the luxury tax on boats, enacted in
1990, that was supposed to increase tax revenue.  All it did was
wipe out jobs and lose tax revenue.  Government tax revenue estimators
do not take into account the rational, to-be-expected response
of taxpayers to tax law changes.
<P>
Further, as so clearly demonstrated in this analysis, the government's
revenue estimation methods as applied to tax-deductible saving
create a tax policy that faces 180 degrees in the wrong direction.
 The economic costs to our nation of this gigantic error can be
measured in trillions of dollars.
<P>
Government revenue estimation methodologies are scandalously wrong.
This must be corrected.

<B><h2><I>Congressional Misperceptions About Measuring The Costs Of
Universal, Unlimited, Tax-Deductible IRAs</B></I></center></h2>
<hr>
<P><blockquote>
 &QUOT;BUT, WE DON'T DO REVENUE ESTIMATES THAT WAY.&QUOT;
<P>
 &QUOT;STAFF SCOREKEEPERS WILL SHOW THAT IRAS PRODUCE HUGE REVENUE
LOSSES.  THUS, THE MEDIA, AND MY CONSTITUENTS, WILL PERCEIVE ME
AS A BIG SPENDER.&QUOT;</blockquote>

<P>

The above remarks are typical Congressional responses (with some
notable exceptions) to the League's position and documentation
that universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs are the proper
method for taxing saving.
<P>
Breaking through this mind-set and the policy inertia it inspires
is not easy, but it must be done.  How?
<P>
A determined, persistent, broad-based public attack on these negative
Congressional misperceptions is imperative.  Every taxpayer, every
segment of the media, every business, union, and association,
and every professional person, including economists, actuaries,
accountants, and lawyers, should assume  responsibility for pushing
Congress and the Administration to face up to the extremely serious
fiscal problem of how our nation taxes personal saving.  All of
us must work to persuade Congressional policy makers to legislate
the right kind of tax environment for personal saving.
<P>

Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-type plans are the proper answer
to our nation's low saving dilemma and slow economic growth. These plans
are vital to our personal, family, business, and national prosperity. <P>
<blockquote>
&QUOT;BUT, THE GOVERNMENT WANTS AND NEEDS ITS MONEY NOW.&QUOT;</blockquote>
<P>
Far too often the above comment is used by members of Congress
and others to justify the government's contention that expanding
the tax deferral of saving is not possible, because the government
wants and needs &quot;its&quot; money now.
<P>
The government's money, of course, is extracted from taxpayers'
incomes and savings-the income that workers, savers-investors,
and business entrepreneurs earn as rewards for helping to produce
things people want to buy.  The more heavily government taxes
the income people save, the less saving people undertake, and
the less investment they make in adding to the nation's productivity
and output growth.
<P>
Government, therefore, should weigh these costs of taxing the
income people save-and taxing the income that savings earn-against
its need for tax revenue now.  Government impatience in raking
in tax dollars is extremely costly to the country and, in the
long run, to the government, too.  It must never be forgotten
that the economic strength of government is bound inextricably
with the economic strength of its taxpayers.
<P>
Government patience in collecting tax revenues is particularly
important when it comes to tax-deductible saving.  Until such
saving, unfettered by taxes, is consumed, it performs highly constructive
triple duty by (1) providing investment growth and/or income for
the saver, and (2) providing more capital to create production,
jobs, and profits, all of which (3) generate more taxes for the
government.
<P>
Only when the taxpayer wants to use for consumption some of the
income he or she has saved and invested should that income be
taxed.
<P>
Saving must come first for the government and taxpayer alike.
 Taxes must come last when saving stops.

WINCONFERENCE '95<BR>
Geneva, Switzerland<BR>
May 5, 1995<BR>
by Jack Kemp<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>


Thank you for the opportunity to address WINCONFERENCE 1995.  I am especially honored to be in the company of such distinguished speakers as President Von Weizsacker, Minister Wu Ti, Arthur Dunkel, and Professors Robert Fogel and Grigory Yavlinsky.
<P>
As we begin the celebration in but two days, of the 50th anniversary of the end of the war in Europe, we are reminded of how far the world has progressed.  The victory of Nazism and Fascism are outdone only by the more recent victories over Communism and apartheid.  We are seeing, however, not just an ending but the triumph of those 18th-century liberal democratic ideas today in extraordinary ways and in places we could never have predicted just a few years ago.
<P>
Consider events in South Africa.  Many people--with good reason--expected the Mandela government to lean leftward toward socialism and collectivism.  But look at what South Africa is doing in the field of housing. <I> The Wall Street Journal </I>reported recently, "The new South African Government's approach to housing for the poor is quite different from those of Western nations: the emphasis is on private ownership, not subsidized rental. . . . the South African way offers a route for its poor to build a better life, step by step.  Moreover, it is a historic departure from those of first-world welfare states and merits consideration elsewhere."
<P>
We live in a historical moment of tremendous opportunity in the world economy--a moment when so many nations are finally escaping the prison of centrally planned economies to discover the new world of free markets, free economies, free trade and free people.  It isn't very orderly and it isn't inevitable, but it's an exciting opportunity for leadership.
<P>
In addition, the United States has experienced no less than a political revolution in the last six months.  The Republicans, led by Speaker Gingrich, now control the House of Representatives for the first time since 1954.  Due in great measure to that shift of political power, in my opinion, the United States is poised to make significant contributions to the global economy.
<P>
I've been asked to speak specifically about America's role in this new world.  I don't believe it is an exaggeration to say that America's policies and America's attitudes will help determine not only its shape but its future.  America's foreign policy, and that of our friends and allies, has, at its best, long sought to advance the inter-connected causes of economic freedom and liberal democracy.  After the Second Work War, the United States recognized it had a responsibility as steward of these ideals.  The policy of containment was conceived not merely as military and territorial, but also as economic and ideological.  In announcing the Truman doctrine before a joint session of Congress, President Truman warned:
<P>
The seeds of oppressive regimes are nurtured by misery and want.  They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife.  They reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died.
<P>
We must keep that hope alive, indeed nurture and enhance it in the world.
<P>
The United States had enough faith in our democratic political system to help establish it in the lands of our former adversaries--and now close allies--Japan and Germany.
<P>
But we did more.  We recognized that a free international order requires certain international institutions to maintain it.  With the memories of beggar-thy-neighbor protectionism of the 1930s still fresh in our minds, the United States helped lead the world in establishing, at Bretton Woods, an international trading system and monetary regime based on a common and predictable unit of account, thereby removing exchange rate instabilities and fluctuations.  We have worked together in GATT to establish a system of open, free trade among nations.  All of this laid the groundwork for the incredible growth of work trade and the remarkable stability of the new quarter century as the West recovered from World War II.
<P>
It is my belief that an active, engaged America, and a United Europe, must help play that same vital role today;  promoting free markets, restoring stable and honest money, and helping build the institutions of democratic capitalism (particularly in the third world and former communist nations).  But fulfilling that promise directly depends on avoiding two great temptations.
<P>
One is the temptation of isolationism and protectionism which is sometimes found on the far-right.  The other temptation is the mindless multi-lateralism of the left.
<P>
With regard to the first temptation, two events have reshaped America's image of itself since World War II.  First is the recovery and prosperity of the Pacific Rim and Europe in particular.  Protectionist have attempted to use this fact to stir up resentment and fear.
<P>
Second, the Soviet Union collapsed under the weight of its own brutality and broken promises.  Isolationist have tried to use this as an argument that America's international role has ended.
<P>
The goal of both isolationists and protectionists is the same;  to narrow America's focus to domestic concerns, protect our markets and allow a world of strangers to take care of itself.
<P>
But the whole approach is based on the myth that the world economy is a zero-sum game, where every winner must be matched by a loser.
<P>
Fortunately, I think that most Americans and Europeans recognize and understand that the growth and prosperity of a unified Europe is good for America, and the growth and prosperity of the United States is good for Europe.  I was a strong supporter of NAFTA and GATT because I believe they are a vision of the entire world's future--free trade that extends to the Pacific rim and Europe so all can share in new markets and new prosperity from expanding global markets.  Now is the time to link a new trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific trade zone to NAFTA.
<P>
Protectionism in any form undermines efficiency by creating privileged industries and reducing the standard of living of workers and consumers.  Free trade is the best way to promote international development and attack third-work poverty.  Open markets bring benefits to both consumers in developed nations and workers in developing ones and vice versa.
<P>
The second great temptation, which is more common on the left, is for the United States to remain involved in the world, but to pursue a mindless and counter-productive multi-lateralism which turns over the economies of Third World and Eastern European countries to the IMF.  Mexico has been the most disturbing and recent example of the zero-sum approach.
<P>
The crisis in Mexico was not caused by some unexplainable force or unavoidable economic law.  It was caused by an explicit policy decision by the Clinton administration and international financial institutions, a policy of competitive devaluation that is based on the idea that Mexico would be better off by repudiating its debt, devaluing its currency, and dramatically reducing its imports.  The United States and the IMF advised the Mexican Government to devalue the peso, which has led to the institution of wage and price controls, higher taxes, the adoption of a comprehensive austerity, and loss of jobs, wages and pensions.
<P>
But austerity and devaluation are the problem, not the solution.  You can not enrich poor nations by impoverishing their people.  The answer to poverty is economic growth and entrepreneurial capitalism, which flow from the freedom of individuals to work, save, invest, be entrepreneurs and produce new wealth.  The role of government is to protect these freedoms.  This means preserving the value of people's money, not cheating them out of their savings, pensions and wages through so-called competitive devaluation.
<P>
Governments have a moral and pragmatic responsibility to protect, promote, and preserve the value of their currencies.  Argentina's minister of finance, Domingo Cavallo, put it best when he said his currency, the peso, is "a contract between the government and the peso holder.  That contract guarantees that each peso-- as a unit of value that the holder has worked hard to get--will be worth as much tomorrow as it is today.  If the government breaks that contact, it's breaking the law.  The only role of the government in the economy should be to guarantee the integrity of market transactions."  He could have said the same thing about the U.S. Dollar, the Deutsche Mark, the Yen, the Swiss Franc or any other currency.
<P>
It is interesting that ten years ago, when the dollar was a at a peak, the U.S. was advised that the budget deficit was causing the dollar to soar, and thus causing a trade deficit.  Now the dollar has fallen compared to the Yen from 270 to 83, yet the trade deficit has increased.  The conventional wisdom is telling us that our budget deficit causes a weak dollar and thus a trade deficit.  The lesson in this?  There is no connection between exchange rates and budget deficits.  You cannot cure a monetary problem with a fiscal solution.
<P>
A nation's people are its primary source of wealth.  What they need most is honest money and low tax rates to create opportunity--access to capital, ownership, and entrepreneurialism, which create wealth, jobs and enterprises.  Jude Wanniski, author of<I> The Way the World Works</I>, explained it well when he wrote, "The difference between people is the difference in the amount of capital available to them--financial capital or education capital.  Men are the same everywhere in the world, insofar as you give them a shovel to dig a hole with.  They do about as well in Rwanda, Bulgaria, Morristown or Sacramento.  Because we dig with power tools here and with sticks in Rwanda, our real wages are much higher.  If you tax capital too heavily, you are taxing this type of capital, and thus limiting the incomes of people."
<P>
We in the developed nations of the world should use our resources to help foster third-world and former Soviet bloc countries in the skills of market capitalism.  We should help build the institutions that liberate individual enterprise--private property, access to market, access to credit, stable legal structures, and easy incorporation of new businesses.  This is the best hope of developing world and the best definition of true cooperation and compassion for the less developed world.
<P>
The conventional wisdom on the left and the right all too often says the same thing:  that economic recovery, if possible at all, will be painful, hard to endure, and of such duration that not much can be done except inject massive doses of government assistance and IMF austerity.  But this, ladies and gentlemen, is exactly the same thing people said and believed about post-war West Germany.
<P>
Devastated post-war Berlin was the essence of a zero-sum society.  History records that young men fought with senior citizens for food scraps in the ruins and trash bins.  The Reichsmark was all but abandoned and replaced by a so-called "Zigaretten Wirtschaft" or cigarette economy.  A carton of Lucky Strikes became the unit of account, food, construction costs, workers wages . . . just about everything was priced in cigarettes.  The German press speculated about a possible U.S. loan of 50 million cartons of cigarettes to support the worthless Reichsmark.
<P>
People were losing hope that life would ever rise above this bleak level.  In the United States there were worries that democracy itself would fail in Europe if prosperity could not be restored.  And then, suddenly, something happened.
<P>
A finance minister who had studied the classical writings of Smith and Ricardo came to the forefront.  In just a few strokes of incredible political courage and economic vision, Ludwig Erhard changed the course of German history, and thus Western hopes for reconstruction.
<P>
One day in June--the 20th of June, 1948--he reformed the currency by abolishing the Reichsmark and substituting the Deutschemark.  He crushed inflation by tying the new currency to the U.S. Dollar, which, in turn, was tied to the stable exchange rate system worked out at Bretton Woods and thus established the integrity of this new West German numeraire.
<P>
Henry Wallich, a one time U.S. Federal Reserve Board member, in his book<I> The Mainsprings of German Revival</I>, wrote, "The spirit of the country changed overnight.  The gray, hungry and dead-looking figures wandering about the streets in their ever-lasting search for food came to life as, pocketing their 40 D-Marks, they went on their first spending spree."
<P>
On June 22, because inflation had pushed West German people into extremely high tax rates, Erhard indexed the tax brackets, dramatically lowering effective tax rates.  On July 7, he abolished rationing, canceled hundreds of regulations and eliminated wage and price controls, against the advice of the U.S. State Department and the military command.
<P>
According to the history books, within a year, West German workers were eating more and better food than those in austerity-ridden Britain, which had turned to a socialist government and, incidentally, received more Marshall aid money.
<P>
In two years, West Germany's real income increased 40 percent.  By 1952, her exports had risen 60 percent.  Over 12 years, from 1950 to 1962, while the U.S. GNP was increasing by a healthy 50%, West Germany's rose at a rate five times as great--247%.  Within a generation an autocratic nation twice defeated in the century's most destructive wars had become not only a world economic power, but a trusted friend and ally.
<P>
What caused this <I> Wirstchaftswunder-- </I>this economic miracle?  Well, first of all, it was not a miracle at all.  chancellor Adenauer and his Economics Minister, Ludwig Erhard, both said the Marshall plan had little to do with it.  It wasn't some government industrial policy.  It certainly wasn't a world bank or IMF-imposed austerity program.
<P>
Ludwig Erhard did not discover some magic formula or experience a sudden Utopian vision.  He simply, yet profoundly, applied the socially responsible free market prescriptions of classical supply-side economics.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>He established a stable currency and maintained its integrity as a storehouse of value and a unit of account.
<LI>He slashed tariffs and other trade barriers.
<LI>He allowed the markets to work freely in setting prices and wages, and in allocating resources by eliminating, in one bold stroke, all rationing and price controls.
<LI>He dramatically rescued the steeply graduated tax rates on working, saving, investing, and producing.
<LI>He applied orderly principles of law to private property, patents, and contracts.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Erhard's reforms all rested on one fundamental principle of democracy:  that prosperity, wealth, and opportunity can only be created by people acting freely and entrepreneurially--by strengthening the people and their markets and relying on free enterprise--not government planning.
<P>
This is a message for Mexico and, indeed, every nation on earth:  The key to wealth and prosperity is allowing people freedom--freedom to work, to save, to trade, to succeed, and yes, to fail and yet try again.  The ultimate causes of wealth of nations are free people, free trade, and free enterprise.
<P>
This means preserving the value of people's money; not cheating them out of their savings through devaluation.  This will encourage them to save more.
<P>
This means defending their property rights through the rule of law, so the people need not fear the confiscation of the fruits of their labors.  This will encourage them to produce more.
<P>
This means taxing solely to raise revenues for the legitimate needs of the state, not to punish wealth and success to promote so-called egalitarian ends.
<P>
This means preserving the competition of the marketplace at all levels of enterprise, resisting the impulse to protect big business and state enterprise at the expense of young entrepreneurs who ultimately create most new wealth and new jobs.
<P>
These are the lessons we have learned in the West in the last two centuries, beginning with the linkage of Jeffersonian democracy and Adam Smith's economic system of natural liberty.  We have relearned and refined these lessons with Erhard's miracle in Germany, President Reagan's revolution in the United States, Margaret Thatcher's revitalization of Great Britain, Vaclav Klaus' success in the Czech Republic, and in the dramatic achievement of Asian economies.  Once started in motion, ideological momentum is difficult to stop.  Having achieved a victory in one place, it transcends borders and cultures and acquires a life of its own.
<P>
This is the genius of economic freedom from which every nation can benefit, both rich and poor, north and south.  No one succeeds at the expense of another.  Everyone benefits from their neighbor's prosperity.  It is the common ground on which to build a stable international community.  Protectionism yields conflict.  Economic freedom yields cooperation.  We create the conditions for peace throughout the advance of trade.
<P>
And that same freedom provides hope to nations that have lived too long without it.  Poverty is not an immutable condition.  Every nation is richly supplied with the most important natural resource--human creativity.  This is the seminal message of democratic capitalism's triumph:  growth is the product of individual effort, where the link between effort and reward is both preserved and promoted.
<P>
As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of V-E Day, we should look once again at the 1944 conference of Bretton Woods.  The agreement at Bretton Woods successfully established an international monetary regime and helped promote free and open markets throughout most of the free world.  Ultimately, the agreement was responsible for unprecedented growth, prosperity, and trade.
<P>
Now with the end of the cold war, we have the perfect opportunity to have a new "Bretton Woods" international conference of the leading industrial and developed nations of the world to conclude the work begun at the G-7 in 1985 under Secretary James Baker.
<P>
But before that, the United States must get our own monetary house in order by re-establishing the U.S. Dollar as a reliable numeraire.  It must once again be as good as gold, which will have the effect of lowering interest rates.  As Utah Senator Bob Bennett pointed out, "For every one percent [interest rate] deduction on $4.5 trillion debt, that is $45 billion dollars in annual savings."  Furthermore, the U.S. must reduce the deficit not by raising taxes but through spending restraint and cuts, and tax-rate cuts.  I have been asked by the Republican leadership in Congress to chair a commission to restructure the tax system in the United States.  It is my goal to work toward a flatter, simpler, and fairer code which broadens the tax base and stimulates growth and capital formation.  This would strengthen the U.S. Dollar without requiring higher interest rates.
<P>
We should also immediately expand NAFTA to include Chile and other Latin American countries.  And it is time to establish a trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific free trade agreement that would unite the European common market with a North American and Pacific common market.  We must then invite third-world and developing nations of both Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe to participate in a global free trade initiative to offset the growing protectionism of both the political right and the political left.
<P>
And fourth, restore the IMF to its original purpose, which was to manage the exchange rate system and provide short term balance payments assistance for developing nations.
<P>
Finally, we must remember that there are no limits to growth in our world--just frontiers waiting to be opened and opportunities waiting to be explored.  If the United States encourages those economic pioneers who cross those frontiers--with policies that favor enterprise over planning, sound money over devaluations, growth over austerity--it will play a leading role in the advance of freedom, peace, and prosperity.  It is a role that will not only serve the interests of the United States, but will help unleash the creative ingenuity and vast resources of the rest of the world as well and lead us to the peace and prosperity so long dreamed about by our founders.  We must remember the words of President Ronald Reagan in his 1982 address to the British Parliament:  "We must be staunch in our conviction that freedom is not the sole prerogative of a lucky few, but the inalienable and universal right of all human beings."  What a great challenge for us all to undertake.<P>

<CENTER><H2>What Is The American Conservative Union? </H2></CENTER>

  </center> 
 <P> 
 The American Conservative Union is the nation's oldest conservative   
lobbying organization. ACU's purpose is to effectively communicate and   
advance the goals and principles of conservatism through one multi-issue,   
umbrella organization. The <a href="/conservative/acu.html">Statement of Principles</a> makes clear ACU's   
support of capitalism, belief in the doctrine of original intent of the   
framers of the Constitution, confidence in traditional moral values, and   
commitment to a strong national defense.  
 <P> 
Over the years, ACU has been on the cutting edge of major public policy   
battles. Among ACU's significant efforts, past and present, are opposing   
President Clinton's bureaucratic health proposal, his excessive spending   
and taxes, the Panama Canal giveaway, fighting to keep OSHA off the   
back of small businesses, opposing the SALT treaties, supporting aid to   
freedom fighters in Marxist countries, promoting the confirmation of   
conservative Justices to the Supreme Court, battling against higher taxes,   
and advocating the need for near-term deployment of strategic defenses.   
 <P> 
In 1994, through its Citizens Against Rationing Health coalition,   
sponsorship of national "town meetings," and a "Health Care Truth   
Tour," ACU spearheaded the conservative response on the health   
reform issue.  
 <P> 
Whether fighting for lower taxes and less government spending, more   
effective and efficient military protection, or the cause of freedom world-  
wide, by speaking for the entire conservative movement the American   
Conservative Union is always "Your Conservative Voice in Washington."  
 <P> 
<a name="ratings"><h3>RATINGS</h3></a><br>
<a href="#table">Contents</a>  
 <P> 
 Since 1971, ACU has published annual ratings of Congress. Each   
member of the House and Senate is rated on a scale of 0 to 100, based on   
actual votes cast on a wide range of issues. The ratings are designed to   
show how members vote on all the major issues to gauge their adherence   
to conservative principles. As the conservative rating listed in all major   
political almanacs and reference guides, the ACU ratings are often quoted   
by the media and are extensively used by political strategists and   
candidates running for public office.  
 <P> 
The American Conservative Union has periodically published several   
special Voting Indices on specific important issue areas such as defense   
and SDI, judicial nominations, and pork barrel spending. In election   
years, the ACU has provided Interim Ratings of Congress to track votes   
that occurred during that Session before the elections.  
 <P> 
  
<a name="pubs"><h3>PUBLICATIONS</h3></a><br>
<a href="#table">Contents</a>
 <P> 
ACU publishes selected legislative guides that are working manuals   
primarily used by members of Congress and their staffs. One example is   
<i>The Clinton Plan: More Power to Government</i>, documenting the  
Clinton record, and showing how he has consistently worked to give more power to Big Government -- and less to the American people.  
Another is <i><a href="/conservative/platformwelcome.html">The 1996 Committee for a Conservative Platform</a>  
</i>; a coalition effort by more than thirty groups to keep the Republican Party platform conservative.  
 <P> 
ACU has also produced audio and video messages, such as TV   
documentaries on the SALT treaties and the Panama Canal, among   
others. Recent productions have included hard-hitting ads on the Clinton   
gas tax, opposition to an invasion of Haiti, and an "infomercial" on health   
care reform. Complete A-V tapes of CPAC proceedings are also made   
available each year.  
 <P> 
<a name="cpac"><h3>CPAC</h3></a><br>
<a href="#table">Contents</a>  
 <P> 
 Since 1974, the ACU has hosted the annual <a href="http://www.cpac.org">Conservative Political   
Action Conference</a>. Thousands of conservative activists and leaders from   
around the nation meet for three days to discuss current issues and   
policies, and set the agenda for the future. Open to the general public,   
CPAC always offers a distinguished cast of participants. Among them   
have been Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, Vice   
President Dan Quayle, Senate GOP leader Bob Dole, House Speaker 
Newt Gingrich, numerous other Senators and Representatives, Cabinet   
officers, media correspondents, international celebrities and other key   
political figures. CPAC serves to bring dedicated and talented Americans   
into the conservative movement and to train and motivate them for   
political action.<P>

<title>William W. Pascoe, III -- ACU</title>
</head>
<body>
<center>
<h2>William W Pascoe, III</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
William W. Pascoe, III, is the Political Director of the American Conservative Union, based in Alexandria, Virginia.  The ACU, celebrating its 31st anniversary, is the nation's oldest conservative grass-roots lobbying organization, and represents more than one million members and supporters, in each of the 50 states.  The organization lobbies on the entire range of issues before the Congress, and its annual vote ratings -- widely used by the media, academics, and other congressional analysts -- are considered the premier indicator of the Congress' ideological voting patterns.<p>
In his capacity as Political Director, Mr. Pascoe is responsible for overseeing the legislative, communications, and field operations of the organization.  These responsibilities entail gathering, collating, and analyzing information on matters of legislative interest; maintaining liaison with Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, their staffs, and committee staffs; representing the views of the ACU before such officials and staffs; directing the grass-roots lobbying efforts of the organization; compiling and analyzing the annual vote ratings; preparing all outgoing public communications of the organization; and dealing extensively with print and broadcast media to represent the organization's views on the wide range of public policy issues.<p>
In addition to his current duties at the ACU, Mr. Pascoe is also a columnist on national and international political issues for the Washington Times, and is the conservative talking head on "BattleLine," a twice-weekly point-counterpoint debate heard Tuesdays and Thursdays on Gene Pell's "Dateline America" radio show, nationally syndicated by Radio America. <p>
Prior to joining the ACU in 1993, Mr. Pascoe held numerous positions throughout the Washington political and policy-making community:  chief of staff to U.S. Rep. Bob McEwen (1992-93); Managing Partner of his own public affairs consulting firm, Pascoe, Norquist, Jones & Co. (1990-92); Executive Director of Krieble Associates, Inc., a private foundation and public affairs office in Washington dedicated to providing assistance to democratic activists behind the Iron Curtain (1988-90); liaison to the conservative community for Bush/Quayle '88, as Director of the Office of National Voter Coalitions (1988); Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation (1985-88); and consultant to the U.S. Department of State (1984-85).<p>
Mr. Pascoe was the Republican nominee for the 47th District seat in the Virginia General Assembly in 1987.<p>
Mr. Pascoe was graduated from the University of Virginia with a BA in Government and History in 1982, and an MA in Foreign Affairs in 1984.  He is a member of the Council for National Policy, the World Affairs Council of Washington, and MENSA.   <p>

<TITLE>1994 Annual Report - Chairman's Report -- Heritage</TITLE>

<P>
In August, at the end of a mind-numbing, daylong congressional hearing on welfare 
reform, Heritage Foundation Senior Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a> began his remarks.
<P>
"The `War on Poverty' has been an incredibly costly failure," he told the House 
Human Relations Subcommittee.
<P>
The "welfare state" is made up of some 75 programs targeted to low-income and 
poor Americans, with a total annual cost exceeding $324 billion; the nation 
has spent $5.3 trillion since the War on Poverty began, he said.
<P>
"What are the names of these programs? Do you have a listing of these programs?" 
interrupted the Subcommittee Chairman, Rep. Harold Ford, Tennessee Democrat.
<P>
"They're listed in my testimony," said Mr. Rector, who went on to explain that 
the average tax-paying household spent $3,400 in 1993 to combat poverty and 
that by 1999, the nation could be spending $550 billion a year on welfare.
<P>
"I'm going to correct you now," Mr. Ford interrupted again. The subcommittee, 
he explained, was only interested in hearing about Aid to Families with Dependent 
Children (AFDC), food stamps, and Medicaid.
<P>
"With all due respect ... you are not going to come here to this committee 
and give us these numbers," Mr. Ford said. "You are not going to leave the 
public perception that we are spending all these billions and billions of dollars 
on welfare."
<P>

<P>

<P>
The above story was recalled in <a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/Wash_Times/">The Washington Times</a> in a major year-end feature 
on welfare reform. Despite Congressman Ford's denials, Heritage's Robert Rector 
is correct: The official Congressional Research Service includes more than 
80 distinct programs in its inventory of "means-tested"  federal welfare programs. 
<P>

Like others at Heritage, Rector spends much of his time challenging conventional 
wisdom. You can't "end welfare as we know it," he says, unless you first understand 
both the nature of poverty and the patchwork system cobbled together during 
the past 30 years to fight it. Rector is one of the few in Washington who understands 
both, and the "fix" he proposed in his August testimony - and in numerous speeches 
and talk-radio appearances throughout the year - can be seen in the House GOP's 
"Contract with America." As <a href="http://www.townhall.com/nationalreview/">National Review</a> described Rector's proposal in 
a Dec. 31, 1994, editorial: "The Heritage Foundation-inspired Talent-Faircloth 
bill takes 65 welfare programs with 10,000 pages of regulations and boils them 
down to one block grant with a short set of guiding principles." The rest of 
the story will be written in 1995.
<P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>

<P>

Throughout 1994, Heritage Foundation analysts repeatedly challenged both the 
conventional wisdom and the status quo. 
<P>
In a few instances, Heritage's role was primarily that of honest critic. The 
administration's crime bill, for example, almost failed after Heritage's Scott 
Hodge examined the fine print and found that the bulk of the funds would be 
spent on spurious "crime prevention" measures, such as arts and crafts and 
midnight basketball leagues. Heritage also was a vigorous critic of the administration's 
health-care plan, its re-regulation of the economy, its misguided foreign policy, 
and the haphazard way in which it has reduced defense spending.
<P>
In most cases, Heritage analysts were ready with concrete alternatives to the 
flawed proposals. The Heritage Consumer Choice Health Plan, for example, provided 
Washington with a principled private-sector solution to America's health-care 
problems - a solution that would increase the choices available to most Americans 
while still helping to control medical costs. Heritage's foreign-policy blueprint, 
"<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/safe.html">A Safe and Prosperous America</a>,"  brought to international affairs a sense 
of mission and purpose lacking in the administration's foreign policy. Heritage's 
updated prosperity plan for America, "Putting Families First" - a comprehensive 
program for strengthening family finances, promoting capital expansion, and 
balancing the budget - served as the basis of the alternative budget offered 
by congressional Republicans. And "The Index of Economic Freedom," released 
at year end, not only showed how the U.S. foreign aid program has gone astray, 
but offered a focused free-market approach to revitalizing the wasteful program.
<P>

<P>

There were even instances when the administration and The Heritage Foundation 
found themselves in agreement. John M. Olin Senior Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/cobb.htm">Joe Cobb</a>, for example, 
played a pivotal role in the debate over the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT) and was publicly credited by both the White House and the media 
with helping to blunt protectionist attacks on the global trade pact.
<P>
Throughout its 21-year history, The Heritage Foundation has always tried to 
make a difference. As the following stories show, the entire Heritage organization 
- research; government, media, and business relations; the lectures and seminars 
program; Policy Review; and Heritage's more than 200,000 community ambassadors: 
its members - all play a role in Heritage's efforts to change the direction 
of public policy. Sometimes, the entire organization may be involved in a project. 
Other times, a single analyst or a single study - when properly marketed to 
key members of Congress and the right mix of media opinion-leaders - can change 
the course of the debate.
<P>
<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">I</FONT>t's a <FONT SIZE = "+2">C</FONT>rime</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Congress's bitter summer debate over the administration's crime bill, for example, 
might never have taken place if it weren't for the tenacity of Heritage's <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">Bill 
Bennett</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a>.  
<P>
When the anti-crime package was first introduced, the bill was expected to 
sail through both houses of Congress by wide margins. After all, with drug-related 
street crime running rampant in most urban areas, what politician wanted to 
be seen as an opponent of crime control? Then Bennett, the former Secretary 
of Education and U.S. drug czar, and Hodge, Heritage's Grover M. Hermann Fellow 
in Federal Budgetary Affairs, took a closer look at the proposal. 
<P>
Bennett, the first public figure to criticize the proposal, found that the 
federal government was once again usurping the power and authority of state 
and local government. Hodge's analysis struck closer to home. Rather than put 
100,000 new police officers on America's streets, as the administration claimed, 
Hodge found that the crime bill would finance only 20,000 police officers - 
leaving state and local government with the rest of the tab. [A subsequent 
Heritage study showed each state exactly how much.] The remainder of the more 
than $30 billion Congress was being asked to approve, Hodge's analysis showed, 
was earmarked for various "crime prevention" initiatives - urban pork - that 
duplicated existing programs, none of which had done much to deter crime. 
<P>
Hodge's findings were marketed aggressively to the news media and immediately 
vaulted to the top of talk radio's list of hottest topics. Critics on Capitol 
Hill quickly joined the fray, and support for the legislation went into free 
fall - all because of a single study that looked beyond the rhetoric at the 
details. So compelling were the Heritage data that the White House communications 
office issued a formal rebuttal in an effort to discredit Heritage's analysis. 
This prompted several reporters to do some homework of their own. To the great 
consternation of the White House, they found that Hodge was correct. As a Harris 
poll later confirmed, a majority of the public got the Heritage message: the 
crime bill was more about pork than about fighting crime. 
<P>
The White House effort to discredit Heritage failed - and the crime bill nearly 
failed with it. In the end, the legislation was approved by a very narrow margin, 
but congressional pork-busters are revisiting the bill in 1995.
<P>

<P>
Heritage's involvement in the health-care debate began in 1989 before there 
was a national health-care debate. Since the publication of that original Heritage 
Foundation monograph, "A National Health System for America" (Stuart M. Butler 
and Edmund F. Haislmaier, editors), Heritage has published more than 50 papers 
on the various problems plaguing the health financing system and the proposals 
- good and bad - for fixing those problems. During the summer of 1994, for 
example, as Congress rushed ahead with alternatives to the mortally wounded 
Clinton Health Security Act,  Heritage's research team worked around the clock 
to offer detailed analyses of proposed alternatives. In one three-week period 
in August, Heritage published and publicized 12 different studies detailing 
the serious problems with various health-care proposals.
<P>
In the end,  the entire effort to increase the government's control over health 
care in America collapsed. The final chapter was a war of words over which 
reform plan would give ordinary Americans the same kind of health coverage 
enjoyed by government officials. 
<P>
It was a war Heritage's analysts and media specialists had spent all year preparing 
for - because only Heritage could win this war. As Heritage asked in a widely 
published advertisement: "Hillary Rodham Clinton Has It. George Stephanopoulos 
Has It. Donna Shalala and all Cabinet Members Have It. Ted Kennedy Has It. 
So Why Can't All Americans Have What They Have?" 
<P>


What they have, we explained, is "a health benefits system that allows them 
to choose among dozens of competing health-care insurers and providers, works 
with a minimum of regulation ... and because it relies on the principles of 
choice and competition, has successfully controlled costs." This was important 
because just one reform proposal, the Heritage Consumer Choice Health Plan 
(and its legislative version, the Nickles-Stearns Consumer Choice Health Security 
Act), was similar in design to the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program 
(FEHBP). 
<P>
In truth, FEHBP is a government program in name only; all benefits are provided 
by private insurers who compete with one another for business. By focusing 
attention on FEHBP - in hundreds of radio talk-show appearances, speeches, 
congressional Town Hall meetings, Capitol Hill briefings, and newspaper editorial 
board meetings - Heritage experts were able not only to point to an existing 
market-based system that works, but to demonstrate the insincerity of Washington 
officials who would impose a government-run system on most Americans while 
retaining a consumer-based system for themselves.
<P>

<P>
With time running out, most major sponsors of reform legislation - including 
President Clinton, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA), and other backers of government-run 
health care - had no choice but to claim their proposals' kinship to FEHBP, 
even if it wasn't true. Those who had been closely following the health-care 
debate knew better; only the Heritage plan - based on the principles of individual 
choice and market competition  - followed the successful model.
<P>
While support for the other reform plans withered as the details became better 
known, support for the Heritage approach increased as details became more widely 
known. The support was as broad as it was deep. Some 25 members of the Senate 
and an equal number of House members co-sponsored the Nickles-Stearns bill. 
The Heritage approach also was endorsed by several state medical societies, 
a national association of nursing homes, and more than 150 newspapers, magazines, 
and columnists. Meanwhile, some 700 individual doctors became personal advocates 
of the consumer-choice plan as members of the Heritage Foundation Physician's 
Council.

<P>
When Heritage defense analysts <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a> and John Luddy warned in March 
that the Clinton administration had underfunded its own defense plan, the so-called 
"Bottom-Up Review," by a five-year total of $100 billion, the White House and 
Pentagon cried foul.
<P>
A few months later, they - and the rest of Washington - discovered that The 
Heritage Foundation is true to its word when it describes itself as a "conservative" 
think tank. Congress's auditing arm, the General Accounting Office (GAO), took 
its own look at the mismatch between the administration's defense plan and 
the Pentagon budget and found that Heritage's $100 billion estimate had been 
very conservative. The shortfall, GAO said, was closer to $150 billion.
<P>
After the GOP takeover of Congress - which catapulted two long-time friends 
of Heritage's,  Sen. Strom Thurmond and Rep. Floyd Spence, South Carolina Republicans, 
into the chairmanship of the Senate and House Armed Services committees - the 
administration suddenly "got religion" and admitted that the defense budget 
would have to be increased substantially in order to maintain military readiness. 
The increase the administration proposed was inadequate, but at least it was 
a start.
<P>
Heritage's analysts, meanwhile, continued to identify billions of dollars in 
non-defense pork that had been buried in the defense budget. Defense spending, 
no doubt, will be a major policy issue in 1995.

<P>
From the crush of reporters and the bank of television cameras lined up in 
the long, rectangular room, you would have thought that President Clinton or 
Pope John Paul II was present. Instead, the star attraction was a radio talk-show 
host. Not any talk-show host, mind you, but the king: Rush Limbaugh.
<P>
The occasion was The Heritage Foundation's orientation conference for newly 
elected members of the 104th Congress. For many of the more than 65 new members 
of the House and Senate who attended the three-day (Dec. 8-10) Baltimore conference, 
co-sponsored with Empower America, the conference was more like a family reunion. 
They already knew Heritage. One new congressman told <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Ed Feulner</a> he had refined 
his political philosophy over the years by reading <a href="/heritage/p_review/welcome.html">Policy Review</a>, Heritage's 
quarterly journal. Many of the others had used Heritage research during their 
campaigns.
<P>
No election in recent memory was more about issues and ideas than the contests 
that took place on Nov. 8, 1994. The House GOP's "Contract with America" - 
attacked by liberals throughout the campaign - provided voters with a concrete 
list of institutional and policy changes. As a number of reporters noted, many 
of the proposals had been seen before - in Heritage books and policy papers.
<P>
True to their promise, Congress's new Republican majority used the first day 
of the 104th Congress to perform surgery on the Congress itself. The "Contract 
with America" had promised a series of far-reaching changes "aimed at restoring 
the faith and trust of the American people in government." Virtually every 
one of these sweeping institutional changes - including a measure that would 
apply all U.S. laws to the Congress itself - had been proposed in Heritage's 
1993 book, "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/ruli.html">The Ruling Class</a>," and fleshed out in subsequent Heritage papers. 

<P>
As Seattle talk-show host Mike Siegel reminded his listeners in a week-long 
series of broadcasts from Heritage's radio studio the week after the election, 
the Heritage recipe for reforming Congress had been a popular staple on talk 
radio throughout 1994. Now these proposals - embraced by millions of ordinary 
Americans while bitterly opposed by much of official Washington - had made 
their way back to the Nation's Capital, and a new revolution in government 
had begun.

<P>
What follows is a report on the people and programs that make The Heritage 
Foundation an American original. 
<P>

<p>


None of the programs should be viewed in a vacuum. The wide range of activities 
is possible only because of the encouragement and active support of Heritage's 
donors. In a city long dominated by the liberal left, Heritage's research papers 
command attention not just because they are timely and thorough, but because 
they are  professionally marketed and always on the mark. And Heritage's lectures 
and seminars, Policy Review and the Resource Bank all help widen the conservative 
circle. 
<P>

<p>
The Heritage Foundation's continuing efforts to build a better America and 
a safer world involve more than 150 dedicated employees and more than 200,000 
members who express their confidence each year by providing the financial support 
that has helped Heritage make a difference for 21 years. n

<h2><B><i>&quot;Our Nation's Debt Is Sky High Already&quot;</center>
<br>
<center>&quot;More Debt From Universal, Unlimited IRA Tax Deferrals 
Scares Me To Death!&quot;</B></h2>
</center></i>
<hr>
Sound familiar?
<P>
According to the Committee on Ways and Means' Green Book (that
describes their income tax revenue estimates), tax-deductible
contributions to IRAs are considered as &quot;tax expenditures,&quot;
and &quot;...tax expenditures can be viewed as...spending programs.&quot;
<P>
In other words, the taxes deferred by tax-deductible IRAs are
treated by the government as if they were part of a spending program
that increases government debt.
<P>
The government, and many others, claim that these tax-deferred
saving programs are undesirable, because:  (a) government debt
is sky-high already; and (b) sound governance dictates that the
government's deficit and debt must be reduced.
<P>
Any debt, private or government, can finance either fruitless
spending or fruitful enterprise.  For example, a person's first
home mortgage probably sends his or her debt sky-high, but the
debt is collateralized by the home and reflects the borrower's
favorable prospect for repayment of the loan.  Such debt is not
considered fruitless.  Certainly, too, the lender treats the mortgage
as an asset upon which it expects to earn income.
<P>
In much the same way, IRA-related government debt is good, not
bad.  In reality, every penny of government debt arising from
IRAs is offset by the directly-related free-market investments
held within each taxpayer's IRA.  The tax money that wasn't collected
by the government didn't disappear-and it wasn't spent on consumption;
it was invested in income-producing assets, adding to the total
income of the economy, hence to total government tax revenues.
 
<P>
In accordance with law, all of this tax money is actually held
in trust within the IRA for the future payment of taxes and invested
in income-producing assets.  Each taxpayer has a legal liability
to pay his or her taxes upon any IRA withdrawal.  Thus, with every
dollar saved in an IRA, the government always obtains a tax receivable,
a governmental asset, that always matches the taxpayer's liability.
<P>
Certainly, too, if a bank loaned you money for a business and
you put up collateral equal to two to six times the size of the
loan, a bank wouldn't impose a second layer of cost upon you that
required you to pay a percent of the relevant increase in the
equity in your business each year until you paid off your loan
in full.  Such a second layer of cost is analogous to the government's
second layer of tax on saving under the ordinary income tax for
people in the various income tax brackets.  How long do you think
that bank would stay in business unless it had the sovereign power
of government to impose its will?
<P>
As shown in this analysis, with tax-deductible IRAs, the government
can make huge amounts of money by:  (a) not being so quick to
tax a taxpayer's income before he or she can even save and invest
it; and (b) not taxing the returns on that saving each year thereafter.
 Collecting taxes when saving ceases is proper and productive
taxation for the government.
<P>
Clearly, IRA-related government debt does not arise from any government
spending, it arises solely from taxpayers' saving.  Every home
owner with a mortgage knows that his or her liabilities (debt)
have increased-but so have his or her assets.  Thus, debt is not
inherently bad.  Our nation would be far poorer without it.  The
same accounting and economic perspectives are properly analogous
to tax-deductible IRAs.
<P>
Further, tax-deductible IRAs, in the aggregate and over time,
will create far more tax revenues for the government than can
flow from the suffocating financial and economic effects that
arise from the ordinary income tax on saving.
<P>
Tax-deductible IRAs increase new saving and private capital formation,
thereby creating more jobs and productivity growth.  From this,
our nation's economic fortunes will spiral upward, not spiral
downward, as currently induced by the ordinary income tax treatment
of saving.
<P>
<b>Existing Government Debt &amp; Existing IRA Assets</b>
<P>
Our nation's existing qualified plan assets (the assets of pensions,
profit sharing, 401(k) plans, IRAs, etc.) currently total more
than three trillion dollars.  In reality, these assets, primarily
investments in private enterprises, represent the present-value
of future taxable benefits payable to plan participants over some
future period of time.
<P>
If we assume that, on average, these taxpayers will be in the
30&#177;% tax bracket when benefits are paid, then 30&#177;% of
the $3&#177; trillion of qualified plan assets represent the present-value
of future taxes, or $900&#177; billion.  These mega-billions of
dollars currently held in trust for the payment of future taxes
offset an equal amount of directly-related government debt.  The
additional production that flows from these investments, and the
tax revenues on the additional income that production generates,
means that the government's finances are strengthened by these
savings.
<P>
These billions of tax receivables show up nowhere as assets on
our government's tax books.  That's as if the bank that loaned
mortgage money considered all such loans as spending (or losses)
until each repayment is received in some future year.  
<P>
Government debt arising from tax-deductible IRAs reflects a reservoir
of immense financial strength for our nation.  The dynamic tax
revenue gains for the government from universal IRAs will, in
reality, reduce and eventually eliminate that debt over a period
of time.
<P>
It is also very appropriate to point out that even though current
government tax policy decries tax deductions for IRAs, pensions,
and other tax deferred savings programs, the government simultaneously
casts covetous eyes at the wonderful, tax deferred, free-market
accumulations of assets now held within these plans.  The government
seems capable of ignoring the fact that this major reservoir of
free-market capital wouldn't be there without the tax deductions
and tax deferrals the government abhors.  
<P>
Every taxpayer must be constantly vigilant to protect this reservoir
of jobs creating capital from the social engineers within government
who would prefer, if permitted, to dictate how some, or all, of
these assets are to be invested, and/or who would prefer to tap
this reservoir of wealth by imposing more taxes thereon either
directly or indirectly.
<P>
<I>Tax-deductible, tax deferred, free-market assets are the lifeblood
of our nation.  They must be protected and nourished constantly
and vigorously.</I>

<h2><center><I><B>Inertia</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
<blockquote>in*er*tia <I>n</I> The tendency of matter to remain at rest, if
at rest, or, if moving, to keep moving in the same direction,
unless affected by some outside force.</blockquote>
<P>
Common sense, as well as sound economic thinking, tells us that
punishing saving by double taxation just doesn't make sense. 
In fact, it's stupid (i.e., foolish; irrational-as, what a stupid
idea).
<P>
If so, why do we, as a nation, do it?  First and foremost, the
answer is that you, yes you, (and I), tend to be content with
bitching, moaning, wringing your hands, and never taking any action
on your own to change the direction of such taxation;  i.e., you
suffer from inertia-as do we all.
<P>
<I>Let it be stated clearly:  no Congressman, no Administration,
and no &quot;staffer&quot; can properly defend the way our government
taxes saving.  So, we, individually and collectively, must assume
the responsibility to take action to force change.</I>
<P>
Every voter/taxpayer must have the gumption to challenge and demand
of their Representative and Senators a clear statement of their
position on S. 929 and H.R. 3179 (a description of the Individual
Investment Account Act is included herein).  This Act is simple
to understand and is positive legislation from every perspective.
 There are, of course, an increasing number of legislative proposals
that include among their objectives the removal of the double
tax on saving.  It is not the specific bill that's so important,
<I>the most important objective is ridding our economy of the
double tax on saving.</I>  The singular advantage of the Individual
Investment Act is that it is simple to understand and simple to
implement after the legislation is enacted.
<P>
There is no valid reason why your Representative and Senators
should not cosponsor S. 929 or H.R. 3179, and other bills that
move in this positive direction.  Strange as it may seem to you
(if you're not a salesman), legislators have to be asked.  No
legislator has the desire to deny his or her constituents (and
himself, or herself) the fruits of personal saving.
<P>
Up to now, most all legislators have been content to follow the
lead of others (principally staff) who proclaim that &quot;there's
a large revenue loss from tax deferred saving,&quot; or &quot;this
legislation is not the way we do it.&quot;   Legislators, by tradition
or inertia tend to merely accept these proclamations as immutable
fact without digging deeper.  
<P>
Every legislator needs your personal push (i.e., outside force,
see above) to start him or her moving in the proper direction
away from his or her own inertia toward swift removal of the double
tax on saving.  S. 929 and H.R. 3179 certainly pave the way to
do the job completely.
<P>
Your personal note (handwritten  is best) is what it takes.  Have
your spouse, friends, family, and associates write letters, too,
in their own style.  Keep a copy, and if you wish, send the League
a copy, too-we'll follow up.  Don't settle for a bland response.
 Insist on &quot;cosponsorship&quot; or a sound reason why not.
 Be persistent.  And, if you need to be, even a pest.  After all,
it's your money and your financial health that's at stake.  And,
you know-you'll win!  And, so will our nation, including your
children and their descendants.
<P>
<I>An unstoppable force will grow from your personal and business
letters, and contacts, as they add their weight to those from
others.</I>

<h2><center><I><B>The Unlocking Of Fringe Benefit Handcuffs</B></I></center>
</h2>

<hr>
<P>
Our nation's economy is rapidly changing character as new businesses
emerge, older businesses down-size, global competition and opportunities
increase, and people become more independent and mobile due to
rapid technology changes.  This has direct and indirect repercussions
on employment practices, including employer-provided fringe benefits.
<P>
The legendary business analyst and writer, Peter Drucker, in a
recent article about existing employer fringe benefit plans, likened
them to the old fashioned &quot;company store&quot; where employees
were bound to employers, via the products, services, and credits
these stores provided.
<P>
Under today's economic conditions in a very competitive national
and global economy, employer fringe benefit plans have often become
the &quot;company store&quot; handcuffs that keep employees from
exploring new areas of employment.  This &quot;locking in&quot;
operates to the detriment of the employees' economic position
in life, as well as to the detriment of the employer and our nation's
economy.  Handcuffs can tie two people together even if both need
release.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs can greatly change this
existing pattern of employer-provided fringe benefit plans for
the better.  And, there would be no need for government mandates
or controls.
<P>
For example, an employer could decide (and/or bargain) to replace
some part, or all, of its existing fringe benefit program by diverting
the costs of one or more of these plans into the employees' wages
or salaries.  The employees, as owners of unlimited, tax-deductible
IRAs, would receive this welcome wage increase and, in turn, deposit
it within their unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs.
<P>
Using his or her IRA, the individual could purchase fringe benefit-type
coverage(s) to fit his or her particular needs or desires.  By
allowing tax deductions for premiums and/or benefit payments paid
from the IRA, these tax effects could parallel those now found
under employer-sponsored plans.
<P>
Interestingly, the Administration's 1994 &quot;Health Reform Proposal&quot;
included a provision that premium payments made by &quot;self-employed&quot;
persons would be fully tax-deductible.  This is the same approach
that could be used when universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs
are used to replace an employer-provided fringe benefit.
<P>
Consider these advantages of an IRA-based, individualized, fringe
benefit alternative:
<P>
  It enhances an individual employee's personal responsibility
for himself and his family in many ways.  For example, some persons
may choose &quot;high deductibles&quot; and &quot;major medical&quot;
insurance, while self-insuring the less onerous, but administratively
expensive, costs of medical care.
<P>
 Other persons may want or need more or less life insurance than
his or her employer provides.  Some people may choose a long-term
sickness insurance program that's not otherwise available through
the employer.  Alternatively, too, the diverted wages can be saved
in the tax-deductible IRA without replacing the employer-provided
coverage, as might be the case of a young, single employee in
good health.
<P>
 When one considers that a 10%, 20%, 30%, and up, wage increase
can flow from such a basic change in employee benefit plan structures,
it becomes obvious that far more efficient wage/benefits structures
are obtainable without increasing the costs of doing business.
<P>
  In short, the use of unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs as a means
to provide individualized fringe benefits is fiscally sound, very
flexible, and will be very attractive to many employees and employers
alike.
<P>
  Without question, too, the &quot;personal costs/benefits received&quot;
relationship between the IRA owner-buyer and the fringe benefit
provider will greatly enhance claims control and reduce the costs
of coverage.  Spending one's own IRA account money for &quot;coverage&quot;
and &quot;care,&quot; as contrasted with spending from an unlimited
employer or insurer fund, makes a very big &quot;cost control&quot;
difference.
<P>
  Employers may find it desirable to be relieved of the very heavy
burden of choosing, designing, administering, monitoring, and
paying for the plans they now offer.  The employer's overall costs
can be the same, but the diversion of benefit plan costs to wages
can be far more useful to the employee-and the employer.  Certainly,
the employer's &quot;benefit cost&quot; diversion to &quot;wages&quot;
creates a more controllable cost from both the employer and the
user perspective.
<P>
  Clearly, the existing employer-based structure to provide fringe
benefit plans has been stretched to the breaking point in many,
if not most, situations.  Most employers are, after all, in the
business of making products and services, not designing and administering
fringe benefits to fit each employee's particular needs.  This
is true of most all employers regardless of their size.
<P>
  IRA-based fringe benefits do not prohibit employers, unions,
associations, independent providers, such as insurers and Blue
Cross, etc. (or groups thereof), from offering plans to employees,
members, or individuals that will enable the employee (IRA owner)
to select the plan(s) that best fits his or her needs and desires.
 Such sponsored plans will be able to provide the discounts normally
associated with high volume business.
<P>
  Unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-based fringe benefits also help
solve the very serious problem of &quot;benefits portability&quot;
when an employee changes employers, moves geographically, and/or
retires.  Obviously, too, the universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
attributes of an IRA-type plan would greatly facilitate the personal
pre-funding of post-retirement coverages that are so vitally important
to our current and future senior citizens.
<P>
  There will be those in the government and in the private sector
who will claim that employees will wastefully spend the fringe
benefit costs diverted to tax-deductible IRAs.  However, people
need, and should have, the responsibility for their own actions-and
the vast majority of our citizens will welcome this.  There will
always be those who need help, but our localities, private institutions,
and charities are in a far better position to provide that help.
 This will be particularly true when personal saving is released
from the senseless bondage of double taxation.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs create a whole new environment
for imaginative, sound ways in which our citizens can personally
assume more responsibility and opportunity for their own current
and future &quot;financial&quot; and &quot;protection&quot; needs.
 These needs and desires embrace both a &quot;saving&quot; and
&quot;protection&quot; element that can best be decided at a personal
and family level.  And, of course, these needs and desires of
an individual, or family, will undoubtedly change over the years
as circumstances change.  Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
IRA-type plans that can provide fringe benefits offer the maximum,
sound flexibility to meet these emerging changes from both the
employee's and employer's perspective.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs also provide each employer
with the opportunity to re-think the design of its fringe benefits
programs not only in regards to the company's objectives, but
those of its employees, too.  In contrast, replacing the &quot;company
store&quot; with the &quot;government's store&quot; for health
care coverage is a disastrous retreat from the sound, emerging,
very competitive trends of the future.
<P>
The attractive option of combining universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
IRAs with individually selected &quot;saving&quot; and &quot;protection&quot;
alternatives makes absolute sense.

<h2><center><I><B>The Social Security Trust Fund And Tax-Deductible 
IRAs</B></I></center></h2>
<hr>
 <P>
The Social Security Trust Fund can be compared to the proverbial
cookie jar into which mega-billions of excess Social Security
taxes are deposited, only to have these mega-billions borrowed
out by the government for the government's current spending, thereby
leaving the cookie jar filled with governmental IOUs.  
<P>
When baby-boomers retire and the so-called trust fund is diminished,
these IOUs must be redeemed in order to pay benefits.  Who must
then pay off these government bonds?-none other than baby boomers,
their children, and their grandchildren.
<P>
Haeworth Robertson, former Chief Actuary of the Social Security
Administration, states that:  
<P>
&quot;The government would have us believe that Social Security
is accumulating huge trust funds that will be used in the 21st
century to help finance the high cost of retirement benefits that
will become payable.  This simply is not true.  The present trust
funds, and probably the future trust funds, are mere window dressing
and have no economic reality.&quot;  (Newsletter of the Society
of Actuaries, September, 1992.)
<P>
Regardless of how Congress lowers Social Security benefits (e.g.,
increasing the normal retirement age to 70 or 75) and/or increases
Social Security taxes (Congress <I>must</I> take one or both of
these steps for Social Security to survive), the financial burden
of Social Security will always rest on the shoulders of the then-existing,
younger work force.  Such &quot;transfer payments&quot; from the
younger generation (and unborn generation) to the older generation
are a way-of-life that can not survive politically nor economically.
<P>
Unlike Social Security, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs are fully
funded by investments in real income-producing assets.  The income
produced by those assets provides the benefits distributed to
the IRA owners, and the taxes on those benefits will more than
equal the compounded amount of the taxes deferred by the deduction
of the owners' contribution to their IRAs.  In contrast with Social
Security, the distribution of IRA benefits does not require taxing
our children's and grandchildren's income.  Universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible IRAs, as embodied in Individual Investment Accounts,
can and must become the strong financial bastion for current and
future generations.
<P>
 
<P>
The financial soundness of tax-deductible IRAs rests on the solid
rock of free enterprise.  Unlike IRAs, the financial soundness
of Social Security rests upon the power of government to tax,
and to tax again and again.  Such taxation progressively weakens,
not strengthens, our nation and its Social Security promises.
<P>
There is no effective prefunding with Social Security; the system
merely collects and redistributes taxes.  No basic economic growth
is created from Social Security, as is true of tax-deductible
IRAs.  Individual Investment Accounts, as proposed herein, help
create and generate economic self-reliance.  Social Security does
the opposite.

<B><h2><I><center>Pension Plans Can Become Sensible Again</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
IRAs are a form of pension.  Pension plans provide an important
and useful way for people to save.  Unfortunately, the effective
use of pension plans, including IRAs, has been more and more hampered
by one punitive change after another in the income tax laws and
regulations.  Most of these changes have resulted from the existing,
erroneous, self-defeating tax revenue estimation methodologies
of our government.
<P>
It is well-known to all pension plan sponsors, administrators,
advisers, and plan participants that pension plan tax laws, rules,
and regulations have reached the ultimate breaking-point in unfathomable
complexity and government micro-management.
<P>
These complexities are driven by the absurdity of trying to make
existing, outlandish, governmental notions of tax expenditure
revenue estimates of tax-deferred saving apply in the real world
of private enterprise.  It can't be done.
<P>
Billions of dollars are spent every year by the professions, industry,
labor, and government on examinations of the complex, interrelated
pension rules and regulations that are impossible to fathom, even
by those in government who create them or write them.
<P>
All of these complexities become unnecessary if unlimited, tax-deductible
IRAs are available.  Such complexities exist because of:  (1)
the erroneous government notion that tax-deductible IRAs and other
qualified plans cost the government mega-billions of dollars of
lost revenue; and (2) the erroneous government perception that
high-bracket taxpayers are favored economically.
<P>
With universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs, employers, unions,
and associations can again arrange their pension plans to fit
their own unique needs and circumstances.  Rather than having
pension plans sponsored by employers, unions, or associations
decline in number, they will increase.  Further, with universal,
unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs, portable pensions become a reality.
 
<P>
Pensions of all types (defined benefit, defined contribution,
401(k), profit-sharing, thrift, annuities, etc.) will grow and
be better funded because of the recognition of the enormous contribution
of universal, unlimited, tax-deductible saving to the financial
well-being of our nation, our government, and of our taxpayers,
individually and collectively.
<P>
The absurdity of the ever-tightening governmental constrictions
on defined benefit pension plan funding is clearly evident when
such constrictions make the funding projections of The Pension
Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) ever-more alarming.  These
unfathomable, self-defeating, government-imposed pension plan
complexities are leading employers to abandon their defined benefit
plans to the detriment of the PBGC.  In short, the government
is fostering the abandonment of defined benefit pension plans,
with the net result that needlessly underfunded pension plans
are being dropped into the laps of taxpayers via the PBGC!
<P>
All of this convoluted government-created mess can only be corrected
when it is recognized by Congress and the Administration that
the unlimited tax deferral of saving <I>is not contrary to anyone's
interests,</I> including the government's.  It is the responsibility
of plan providers and plan participants to rise up in anger over
such irrational, self-destructive government.

<h2><center><I><B>The Need For Leadership, Initiative, And 
Speed</B></I></center></h2>
<hr>
 <P>
Accountants, actuaries, economists, lawyers, financial officers,
and the leaders of our businesses, unions, associations, and the
media must assume a strong leadership role in forcing our government
to come to grips with its existing budget and revenue estimating
methodologies as they apply to saving.
<P>
Leaders within the private and non-profit sectors of our nation
have failed to seriously address this key issue of &quot;personal
saving&quot; that means so very much to the success of their work
and our nation.
<P>
These individuals, and the institutions that they represent, have
an enormous stake in making certain that remedial legislation
is enacted.
<P>
These people and institutions can have an enormous, positive influence
through personal conversations, meetings, conferences, letters,
newsletters, the media, talk shows, etc.  
<P>
It has been demonstrated in this analysis that universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible IRAs will provide, in aggregate and over time,
far more tax revenue for our government than can ever be derived
from the ordinary income tax treatment of saving.  The exciting,
dynamic financial aspects of such IRAs will add solid growth and
economic strength to our nation.
<P>
The existing methods used by the government for measuring the
IRA's impact on tax revenues are totally destructive.  Tax revenues
are shown as losses where, in fact, ever-growing real revenue
gains exist.
<P>
Because revenue estimates by government scorekeepers allege that
tax-deductible IRAs are billion dollar losers, Congress' existing
revenue neutrality requirements require an increase in taxes elsewhere
to offset the alleged loss from tax deducted saving.  Such erroneous
estimates, and related offsets, create fiscal chaos.
<P>
Huge amounts of economic growth have been, and will continue to
be, totally misdirected, curtailed, and wasted unless these existing
revenue estimation methodologies are completely changed.
<P>
Leaders of professions, labor, businesses, and associations must
lead their groups to demand corrective legislation.  Everyone,
including the government, will benefit.
<P>
<center><blockquote>ENACTMENT OF LEGISLATION TO CREATE UNIVERSAL, 
UNLIMITED, TAX-DEDUCTIBLE IRAS, AS EMBODIED IN INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT 
ACCOUNTS, MUST BE IMMEDIATE.</center></blockquote>

<h2><center><I><B>Wealth</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
The word &quot;wealth&quot; has many connotations.  Too often,
financial wealth is interpreted negatively, thereby implying that
wealth is not desirable.  Or, that perhaps wealth above some level
is too much.
<P>
Obviously, too, financial &quot;wealth&quot; is easily interpreted,
as they say, in &quot;the eyes of the beholder.&quot;  Great wealth
to one person may be little wealth to another.
<P>
Regardless of personal feelings as to what is &quot;wealth,&quot;
from a financial perspective it is important for everyone to recognize
that savings, regardless of amount, are wealth.  And, having savings,
i.e., wealth, regardless of amount, is good for everyone-the person
who has it, those who use it directly or indirectly, and our nation.
<P>
We all prefer to live in a wealthy nation-and the wealth of a
nation is derived from the wealth of its people-not the other
way around.  The financial wealth of people can only arise from
saving (not consuming) and its fruitful use.  When people borrow,
they borrow someone else's saving.
<P>
Saving, and its growth, produces wealth.  Thus, it makes absolute
sense for governments-via their sovereign power-to encourage private
saving, and its growth, by every person.  Needless to say, for
our government to needlessly punish saving via the ordinary income
tax is crazy, self-defeating, and an abuse of power.
<P>
The growth of wealth invested via private enterprise should have
no bounds-for anyone-as amply demonstrated in this analysis. 
Government misconceptions concerning the taxation of wealth, and
its accumulation, must change-and change promptly-for everyone's
sake, including the government's.  
<P>
And, the accumulation of wealth (or its maintenance) must not
be constrained by notions that wealth existing at death above
some artificially set level must be captured by government (via
estate taxes, etc.), because the wealth is &quot;too high,&quot;
or because of some artificial notion promoted by some economists
of &quot;life-cycle&quot; taxation.  This usually means that if
the government didn't collect enough taxes while you lived, the
government should get the balance when you die.
<P>
From the government's fiscal perspective, with IRA-type saving,
death should be no more of a taxable event than an investment
transaction.  After all, inherited savings, i.e., wealth, will
continue to create production, jobs, rising standards of living,
more taxes, as well as prospective spending power for the owners
thereof.  Progressive estate tax rates applied to saving, like
the ordinary income tax, cut off the government's fiscal nose
to spite its face.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs avoid estate taxes through
the ongoing deferral of the income taxes on invested wealth. 
In due course, all withdrawals will be taxed at progressive income
tax rates.  This clearly maintains sound tax policy and accumulated
saving.
<P>
Wealth, small or large, is of great value to everyone, directly
and indirectly, including the government.  Certainly, to have
the government snatch away as an additional tax up to 55% of a
person's, or a family's, hard-earned investment growth (wealth)
at the time of death can destroy a lifetime of energetic, productive
work, and/or force individuals and families into nonproductive
(except to avoid the tax) tax avoidance methods.  The rational
taxation of saving, whereby the government maximizes its tax potential,
is to tax saving only when it's consumed.
<P>
<I>Unfortunately, the largest, persistent predator of wealth is
the irrational sovereign power of government.  Eternal vigilance
and diligence is required by each and every voter/taxpayer to
protect their wealth, and to nourish it.</I>

<h2><center><I><B>&quot;Trickle-Down Economics&quot; And &quot;Tax Loopholes
For The Rich&quot;</h2></B></I></center>

<hr>
<P>
Both of the above inflammatory labels have been used to thwart
legislative attempts to improve, expand, and increase the allowable
tax deduction levels of IRAs.  These labels ignore the facts.
<P>
It is correct, of course, that higher-bracket taxpayers also gain
with tax-deductible IRAs.  However, as so clearly shown in this
analysis, this gain is derived solely from the removal of a crushing,
self-defeating, double and triple tax burden on saving that's
imposed by the progressive ordinary income tax.  This tax irrationally
and progressively wipes out the saving accumulations of all taxpayers.
 And, the higher the bracket, the more irrational the second layer
of tax becomes.
<P>
The ordinary income tax should not be applied to saving, because
it is progressively destructive to the government's tax revenues,
as well as the taxpayers' and our nation's wealth.  Under the
ordinary income tax, the higher the tax bracket, the greater the
destruction to all concerned, including the government.
<P>
High-bracket taxpayers should be encouraged to make unlimited,
tax-deducted contributions to IRAs.  Not only does the government
receive far higher tax revenues, the availability of investment
capital for the users of capital (in any tax bracket) is greatly
increased.  This is vital to our nation's economy.
<P>
And, it has been clearly demonstrated in many forums that the
bulk of the benefits derived from increased capital flow to labor.
 The more capital a worker has to work with, the higher is the
worker's productivity, the greater is the demand for his or her
labor, and the higher is his or her real wage rate.  In fact,
if capital doesn't increase more rapidly than labor, productivity,
employment, and real wage rates will not advance.  Increasing
the amount of capital per worker requires reducing the cost of
capital, and that requires reducing the cost of saving.  That's
what tax-deductible IRAs do.  Lowering the cost of capital will
also reduce the cost of government debt.
<P>
Small businesses, entrepreneurs, and job seekers will surely benefit
greatly from capital growth, as will all other taxpayers, both
directly and indirectly.  Without question, the slogans &quot;trickle-down
economics&quot; and &quot;tax loopholes for the rich,&quot; when
applied to universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs, are nothing
but complete red herrings.

<h2><center><I><B>Entitlements</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
So-called &quot;entitlements&quot; are government spending programs
that grow automatically without adequate cost control or constraint.
 Typically, these programs are initiated for modest and humanitarian
reasons.  However, their potential future costs are usually unmeasured,
measured improperly, or ignored.  Further, once established, people
become accustomed to their availability, and the benefits provided
become political magnets for enhancement due to inflation, demographic
changes in the population, and the political power of recipients.
 In short, with the passage of time, they become &quot;entitlements.&quot;
<P>
Three existing entitlement programs-Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid,
and federal welfare benefits-involve huge, ever-increasing costs
that, in aggregate when combined with interest on the national
debt, exceed the government's &quot;discretionary&quot; spending
over which it can, if it wishes, exercise control.  The growth
of these entitlement costs is alarming.
<P>
The funding of entitlement programs can only come from one contributing
source-taxpayers.  When these programs were initiated, the then-existing
contributor/recipient ratio was high (many more taxpayers were
contributors then recipients), and the level of benefits was low.
 With the passage of time, the contributor/recipient ratio has
grown much smaller, and the level of benefits has grown much larger.
 This has created an explosion of ever-increasing costs that are
borne by an ever-diminishing segment of the voter/taxpayer population.
 
<P>
Such costs can only be funded by raising taxes or by increased
governmental borrowing.  Income taxes and payroll taxes typically
transfer the economic values generated by one group of taxpayers
to another group as, for example, when younger people's payroll
taxes are used to fund older people's health care costs and pensions.
 Borrowing to cover these costs unethically passes these costs
to another generation.  
<P>
Regardless of the source of funds (tax or borrowing), these uncontrolled
entitlement spendings extract free-market capital from the marketplace.
 This, in turn, makes the economy progressively weaker, thereby
leading to a political/economic climate that fosters further enhancements
of entitlement programs.  This becomes a gradual, but never-ending,
spiral downward toward economic stagnation, unfair inter-generational
transfer payments via the tax code, and ultimate disaster.
<P>
Changing the way our nation taxes saving so that saving is promoted
and not punished can dramatically change the human/economic dynamics
that lead to these entitlements.  Taxpayers will be far better
able to accumulate assets for their retirement and life's potential
needs for health care and welfare.  Not only will free markets
grow more rapidly, thereby enhancing living standards and employment
growth, the need and pressures for entitlement programs will diminish.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs can do wonders by helping
to remove the ever-increasing and divisive cost burden of entitlements
from our nation's shoulders.

<h2><center><I><B>Family</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>

Personal saving is not just an economic matter for our nation; personal
saving helps build the strong sinews of family life. Family life is, and
should be, the strongest, most cohesive economic force within any nation. 
<P>
Parents, particularly, are always striving to better their lives, in no
small part in order to better help their children and other family
members.  The act of saving creates a storehouse of economic values for
future enjoyment or needs that can smooth and enhance family life. 
<P>
After all, our nation's economic strength and values must always represent
the aggregate economic strengths and values of individuals and their
families, not vice versa. 
<P>
Too often we have seen tax policy mistakenly curtail the individual's and
the family's ability and responsibility to accumulate savings. As a
result, without savings, individuals and families gradually, but
inexorably, become dependent on others or on the state. 
<P>
The ordinary income tax is the classic example of a slow, but
sure, progressive tax abuse of saving.  Other examples include
the misguided imposition of caps and limits on IRAs and on benefit
plans.  Such benefit plans provide advance funding and protection
against economic calamity.
<P>
Plain common sense and the traditional American drive for self-reliance
dictate that it is far better to permit individuals and families
to accumulate the maximum possible tax-deferred savings and investment
they can achieve.  People can better build their own lives and
protections without government interference or dole.  Not only
does this provide more freedom from economic fear, it adds joy,
purpose, and far greater economic health to everyone's life.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs provide each individual,
and his or her family, a far superior way to fulfill those innate
responsibilities to save and invest for their future needs and
desires.  These family needs, desires, and responsibilities are
intertwined among generations stretching over many years and should
not be curtailed by unwise taxation.

<h2><center><I><B>Home Ownership And Life Insurance</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
<I>Home Ownership</I>
<P>
Owning one's home has been a major objective for our citizens
and our nation for well over a century.  Not only has this proven
to be of economic value to all, it has helped maintain and nurture
family values that are so important to any strong nation.
<P>
And, as would be expected, home ownership has proven to be the
largest investment made by most individuals during their lifetimes.
<P>
All of this has been fostered by attractive tax laws that permit
a tax deduction for mortgage interest on this investment, as well
as permitting any gain in the value of a home, to be carried forward
without income tax for lengthy periods of time, including no income
tax on any gain upon death.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs can further facilitate
home ownership in a very attractive, sound way from both the taxpayers'
and government's perspective.  For example, such IRAs could be
expanded to include an &quot;IRA/Residence Rollover&quot; provision
such as:
<P>
  Up to $15,000 could be withdrawn from a universal IRA without
any income tax, provided the sum is used for a first-time home
purchase.  Note, however, that the individual's basis in the home
would be reduced in like amount.  Thus, Uncle Sam's tax on this
type of IRA withdrawal is deferred, not lost.
<P>
  Upon the sale of the home, the sale proceeds could be rolled
over into the IRA without any income tax.  Note, however, that
the individual's tax basis on the home (including the $125,000
tax-free amount after age 55) is also rolled over into the IRA.
 Thus, the tax otherwise imposed on the sale proceeds is deferred
and not lost to the government.  In effect, the home seller exchanges
an &quot;unproductive&quot; asset (the home) for &quot;productive&quot;
IRA assets (investments).
<P>
Even though the government's taxes would be deferred via this
primary residence rollover option, the government would make money
on this program.  All withdrawals in excess of tax basis would
eventually be taxed at ordinary income tax rates, and the individual(s)
would be giving up a stepped-up basis at death.
<P>
<I>Life Insurance</I>
<P>
A family that is saving and investing for life's later years is
always subject to the calamity of a premature death.  Investments
in life insurance (either term or cash value) should be allowed
in universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs, provided the proceeds
are to be paid into the account, or added to a policy's cash value.
<P>
By fulfilling the family's funding objective, enhanced, tax-deferred
financial resources can be available over ensuing years following
the death of the insured.  These proceeds, like the other account
assets, would be subject to tax upon subsequent withdrawal.

<center><h2>"IT'S DRUGS, STUPID," ACU SAYS</h2></center>
<p><strong>ALEXANDRIA, VA.</strong>--- "At a time when the latest statistics indicate marijuana use among teen-<br><br>agers is up 37% and as we face a national crisis on drug abuse, Bill Clinton fiddles while Rome <br><br>burns talking about tobacco use," said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. <br><br>Keene. "The way the Clinton Administration and its liberal allies portray it, tobacco is the greatest <br><br>scourge affecting children since the dawn of time and nothing short of a full-blown crackdown by <br><br>the Federal government can solve it. But the real problem is drug abuse and all its associated evils, <br><br>and the Clinton Administration has exhibited a scandalous indifference to the appalling increase in <br><br>illegal drug use."
<p>Keene noted that U.S. Department of Health and Human Services statistics released earlier this month show overall drug abuse among teens is up 78% between 1992 and 1995.  Marijuana use by teen-agers is up 37%, LSD use is up 54%, and cocaine use is up 166%.  He also pointed to a second new government report showing hospital emergency room visits resulting from marijuana abuse is up 96%.  Before Clinton took office, teen-age drug abuse had declined for a decade according to a third survey, conducted by <em>USA Today</em>.
<p>"What's really at work here is a cynical attempt to gain political mileage at the expense of addressing the real problem," Keene continued.  "The Administration, knowing it lacks credibility when it comes to waging the real war -- the war on drugs -- thinks it can cover itself with a phony war on tobacco.
<p>"As early as the 1960's and 1970's, the science was conclusive about the hazards of illegal drug use," Keene said. "But the then-youthful liberals who today occupy top positions in Washington, Hollywood and elsewhere ridiculed the dangers of marijuana and rejected society's disdain over 'hard' drugs.  They agitated to decriminalize marijuana cutlivation, possession and use.  They attacked, then as now, conservatives and other advocates of traditional cultural and moral values.  Today, as adults, they minimize and rationalize their own dalliances in the illegal drug scene.  For example, the President did not say that his own marijuana experimentation was wrong because it was illegal, or dangerous, or manifested anti-social behavior -- he excused himself by saying that he 'didn't inhale.'
<p>"No one, not even the tobacco companies, who are clearly on record about it, think it's a good idea for young people to smoke," Keene added.  "But the liberal establishment's election-year hysteria over tobacco is hypocritical in light of its record on illegal drug policy.  After all, the permissive social and political attitudes of liberalism gave birth to the drug culture.  Many liberals seem unwilling to offer more than lip service when it comes to fighting it and belittle those who try -- as former First Lady Nancy Reagan can attest from experience.  Should anyone take this Administration seriously in its 'holy war' against tobacco in light of disturbing reports of illegal drug use among the White House staff? What moral authority does the President -- a cigar smoker -- bring to bear? Why is the Administration bent on expanding government power and imposing new layers of regulation on the American people in this instance while turning a blind eye and deaf ear to the critical problem of illegal drug use?
<p>"The American people should be asking tough questions," Keene concluded. "If the Administration should make a Federal case out of anything, it's national drug policy. Apparently Clinton has none, since the statistics speak for themselves. We therefore urge the Administration to wake up to the real and growing threat of illegal drug abuse and stop offering political sideshows to sidestep its real responsibilities."

<h2>FLAT TAX, SALES TAX, WHATEVER: FOCUS MUST STAY ON<br>
JUNKING CURRENT NIGHTMARISH TAX SYSTEM, ACU SAYS </h2>
</center>

<p>
WASHINGTON, D.C.--- "Some conservatives favor a flat tax, others support a national sales or
value-added tax, still others have different ideas on how best to pay for the legitimate
functions of government. The main thing is, we must not allow differences over those approaches
from causing the tax reform movement to lose sight of the real goal: elimination of the current
Federal income tax non-system, with its enormous bureaucracy, byzantine rules and regulations,
and abuses and outrages. That's why ACU is happy to join forces with those who also recognize
the importance of staying focused on the larger objective," said David A. Keene, Chairman of the
American Conservative Union (ACU), at a "Commitment to Tax Reform" press conference in
Washington, D.C., hosted by Citizens for a Sound Economy.
<P>
     "This year's Tax Freedom Day- - May 7 - - was the latest ever," Keene continued. "When you
add in the hidden costs of government, such as regulations and other expensive burdens,
Americans must labor until July 3 before they're in the clear and able to keep all of what they
work hard to earn. That's an outrage to cause every American's blood to boil. The 105th Congress
cannot allow this level and scope of taxation to continue. The current tax structure is
hopelessly beyond repair and the only sane, fair thing to do is scrap it entirely.
<P>
     "ACU has already launched its own long-term project with the objective of abolishing the
IRS and repealing the 16th Amendment, which authorized the Federal income tax. Yet that does not
mean we cannot join with our friends who argue persuasively for a flat tax in saying with them
that what exists now is a nightmare that must end and that the American people deserve tax
justice," Keene concluded. "The issue is no longer whether or not to end taxation as we know it,
but how soon we will get there. Once we get there, we may find that a flat tax is the way to go,
or that the best option is the national sales tax, or that some other approach is better.
Whatever the outcome, we simply must not lose sight of the objective, we simply must not let
Congress dodge the issue any longer, and we simply must make sure that the American people don't
stop pressing for reform."

<h2>ON TAX FREEDOM DAY, ACU URGES 16TH AMENDMENT REPEAL </h2>
</center>

<p>


 
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "It's Tax Freedom Day. Starting now, Americans can keep what they 
work so hard to earn after having spent the past four months working to pay Uncle Sam's tax 
bill," said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. Keene. "With this year's Tax 
Freedom Day being the latest ever, the need for comprehensive tax reform has never been greater. 
That's why ACU is making tax reform its top long-term priority." 
<p>    Keene said that a cornerstone of the ACU effort will be a grassroot-oriented lobbying and 
public education campaign to rally support for repeal of the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, 
which instituted the Federal income tax. 
 
 <p>    "Federal spending, the deficit, the national debt, and the growth of government have been 
spiralling out of control for decades," Keene said. "While the current Republican Congress has 
shown more determination to attack those problems than any in modern times, we have a liberal 
President who refuses to break with the past - - he vetoes every important reform and every 
serious attempt to bring needed change to the way Washington does business. Since the surest way 
to stop the big spenders is to not let them get their hands on the money, the current tax system 
has to go. The enormous tax-gathering bureaucracy, the byzantine rules and regulations, and all 
the abuses and outrages that go with it simply cannot be fixed. The slate must be wiped clean by 
repealing the 16th Amendment, and a sane, fair, workable means of paying for the essential 
functions of government should replace it." 
 
 <p>    Keene said ACU's strategy includes national "Town Meetings" on the tax reform issue, 
distribution of hundreds of thousands of citizen petitions to Congress calling for repeal of the 
16th Amendment and abolition of the Internal Revenue Service, direct lobbying of Congress, 
cooperation with public interest groups also interested in tax reform, and other projects. 

<p>     "The issue is no longer whether to drastically reform our tax non-system, but when," 
Keene added, noting that the issue was a major topic among GOP Presidential candidates and 
continues to rank high on the agendas of key Congressional leaders.  
 
 <p>    "ACU is preparing to buckle down for the long haul," Keene concluded. "We know it may 
take a few years for Congress and the states to complete the process of repeal and for a 
national consensus to be reached on a new and better tax system. ACU's job will be to help make 
sure that Washington does the right thing for the taxpayer, and we'll stay on the job for as 
long as it takes." 
 
<p>     ACU, founded in 1964, is the country's oldest grassroots-oriented conservative lobbying 
organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters, it lobbies on a wide 
range of issues before the Congress.

<title>WHO'S BLOCKING HEALTH REFORM?</title>

<h2> WHO'S BLOCKING HEALTH REFORM?<br>  
                    SURPRISE! IT'S TED KENNEDY </h2>
</center>

<p>
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "Ted Kennedy built a career out of portraying every problem, however 
minor, as a crisis of mammoth proportions requiring immediate, massive government intervention. 
How ironic, then, that this same Ted Kennedy is the only one standing in the way of further 
Congressional action on S.1028, the health care legislation of which he is the chief 
co-sponsor," said David A. Keene, Chairman of the American Conservative Union (ACU). "Obviously, 
the Senator from Massachusetts isn't the least reluctant to fiddle while Rome burns when it 
suits his liberal political agenda." 
 
<p>     Keene referred to Kennedy's thus-far-successful parliamentary ploy blocking the 
appointment of Senate conferees on S.1028, the Kassebaum-Kennedy health care bill. Kennedy's 
delaying tactic is an attempt to pressure Senate leaders into not adding supporters of Medical 
Savings Accounts (MSAs) to the proposed list of conferees. 
 
<p>     "Kennedy and his fellow ultra-liberals really aren't interested in true reform, which MSAs 
represent," Keene continued. "They only want to give the American people another dose of the 
same old Big Government elixir. They want to maintain government power and control, limit health 
care choices, and micromanage health care decision-making by patients, health care 
professionals, and the private sector. MSAs offer consumer choice, not government control - - 
and that is why the liberals oppose them. 
 
<p>     "In his vendetta against MSAs - - the most promising health care insurance reform idea 
proposed in years - - Kennedy shows he's all too willing to play inside-the-Beltway politics 
with people's health care. This is hypocrisy at its worst. The American people should insist 
that Sen. Kennedy either get on board for true reform, or get out of the way and let the rest of 
the American people's elected representatives deal with this issue promptly," Keene concluded. 
 
<p>     The American Conservative Union, founded in 1964, is the country's oldest grassroots 
conservative lobbying organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters, 
it lobbies on a wide range of issues before the Congress.

<h2>AX GAS TAX, ACU SAYS</h2>
</center>

<p>
 
<P>
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "A few months ago, President Clinton admitted that he raised taxes too
much and that it was a mistake. That's all the more reason why he should start making amends
now by supporting the growing movement in Congress to repeal his unnecessary 4.3-cent
gasoline tax. If not, the least he ought to do is make a public commitment not to veto a repeal,"
said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. Keene. 
<P>
     "The current increases in gasoline prices stem from many factors," Keene added, "and as
the marketplace deals with them, prices will eventually decrease - - but only to a point. The
marketplace can't make tax burdens disappear. The public has been forced to get along with less
thanks to Clinton's various tax increases. ACU says it's high time government went on a diet,
and a good place to start is by junking the Clinton gas tax."

<title>ACU Press Release - REPUBLICANS SUPPORT TAX LIMITS, 
DEMOCRATS STILL BIG SPENDERS</title>

<h2>REPUBLICANS SUPPORT TAX LIMITS, <br>
DEMOCRATS STILL BIG SPENDERS</h2>
</center>

<P>
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "The tax-and-spend crowd couldnt escape this time," said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. Keene, commenting on the tax limitation Constitutional amendment vote in the House of Representatives this week. "This was a real test of who wants to make it harder for the government to get its hands on the peoples money and who is a big spender. By and large, Republicans passed the test and the Democrats failed."
Republicans voted 219 to 24 to support limits on the taxes government takes. Democrats voted for business as usual by a vote of 160 against tax limits and only 16 for tax limits.
<P>
"All it takes is a simple plurality to raise taxes and increase spending," Keene said. "Because its so easy for Congress to spend other peoples money, thats why were in the fiscal mess we face today. If Congress claims to be serious about getting taxation and spending under control, then it should be prepared to vote for serious measures to do that. The Tax Limitation Amendment was just such a measure. Were pleased that it won the support of a majority in the House, but disappointed that it fell short of the necessary two-thirds. 
<P>
"We urge the American people to ask some tough questions of Congressmen who opposed this measure, to find out why they think it should continue to be so easy to tax, spend, run up the deficit and expand the national debt," Keene continued. "They also should ask these politicians, especially Democrats, why they insist on maintaining a tax-and-spend policy so out of control that Congress needs to pass a Taxpayer Bill of Rights. Isnt it more sensible to change that system so that we dont have to pass laws to protect people from it?"
<P>


Keene rejected a chief argument of opponents that limiting the ability to raise taxes means   restricting the ability of Congress to use taxation as one way to help balance the budget and reduce the deficit.
<P>
"Too many tax-and-spend liberals think taxes first, spending cuts last - - if they think of spending cuts at all. If you give politicians easy access to the money, theyre going to spend it and then some. The answer is to cut off the gravy train. Americans already pay plenty in taxes. Even if Democrats and a few Republicans dont get it, the American people do: cut government spending and stop raising taxes. The two go hand in hand. ACU will keep up the pressure and work to make sure that next time, there will indeed be enough votes to enact this important remedy," Keene said.
<P>
ACU, founded in 1964, is the countrys oldest grassroots conservative lobbying organization, with nearly one million members and supporters.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Understanding Corporate Government Relations
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr><P>
<font size=3>


	After nearly 34 years in the corporate world, I welcomed the opportunity to join The Heritage 
Foundation after the 1994 elections, when the prospect of a conservative revolution presented an 
irresistible second career challenge. I had always respected the conservative movement and 
supported its mission, even when I found my business colleagues on the other side of an issue.<P>
	In my old job in the corporate community, I found that conservative analysts and activists are 
often suspicious of business. Indeed, in the interest of earning &quot;business value&quot; for 
their companies and shareholders, corporate government affairs offices often put narrow 
economic interests over the broader philosophical or political objectives that motivate 
conservatives. The business community cares less about ideology than about finding the power 
center and lining up advocates on its key issues. This may translate into support for a piece of 
compromise legislation that lifts a burden, lessens a cost, or lowers a barrier, even if it isnt the 
proposal conservatives took to the table.<p>
	The business communitys pragmatic approach to policy making is not very inspiring, but it can 
bring closure and progress on its objectives. My corporate experiences suggest that sometimes 
the beauty of an idea crowds out the importance of strategically implementing a focused plan to 
achieve your objectives. This most certainly is not to suggest compromise on principle, but 
rather the need for a system that is acutely aware of its environment, regularly takes stock of how 
its agenda items are proceeding, and makes necessary adjustments to its priorities, goals, and 
strategies. <p>
Although the commercial instinct for closure and moving on to the next priority often 
serves business interests business interests well enough, it does not always serve them best. 
When it began to appear in the fall of 1994 that conservatives could seriously increase their 
presence in the House and Senate, those positioned to take over the new leadership positions 
were proclaiming a sea change rollback of government.<p>
	The reality of governing, however, dictates that conservatives cannot expect to reform 40 years 
of liberal policies overnight: reinventing government is a slow, deliberate process. Take 
Superfund, for example. Business had pushed hard for meaningful reform of the burdensome 
program and at long last, in 1994, had a bill in committee that was acceptable, though not ideal. 
But conservative senators, sensing the probability of having a majority in Congress after the 
elections, defeated the compromise legislation, promising a &quot;better&quot; bill after the 
election. Business listened to its ideological friends and acted against its instinct for closure, 
deciding to wait for the &quot;better&quot; bill. Because business quickly adjusted to the 
changing political environment and acted against its natural instincts, it will likely see that 
&quot;better&quot; bill enacted some time this year.<p>
	Despite rhetorical victories and the perception that our ideological friends have taken over, many 
point out that the rollback theme has not substantively advanced either the conservative or 
business reform agendas. But should we realistically have expected to overhaul decades worth of 
bureaucratic growth overnight?. Insufficient strength in Congress, special interest tactics, and a 
demagogic White House have thwarted usso far.<p>
	The business and policy communities will  eventually see key components of their agendas 
enacted, however, if they make timely adjustments to strategy, focus on the most important 
goals, and a develop a keen awareness of changing legislative and poltical environments. From 
my perspective, we can have more success advancing the conservative agenda in 1996 if we 
learn to focus our energies on the most important goals by adapting more quickly and shrewdly 
to this volatile political environment, as business did with Superfund reform.<p>
	Management guru and author Tom Peters has said that even the best-run companies are only 18 
months from failure. In order to stay competitive, well-run companies gear their systems to 
anticipate changes in their environments and adjust plans accordingly. Policy making (or 
unmaking) is a complicated task worthy of the best thought and strategic planning. 
Conservatives need to sharpen their skills at anticipating changes in the debate, adjusting our 
marketing and message delivery, and building strategic coalitions. The movement may not have 
the luxury of 18 months to consolidate the revolutionfocus and closure are critical.<p>

  By "lower," we do not mean "bad."  The bliss of marriage 
consists in part in the sexual union of spouses.  That union 
is, in the human species, elevated and inspired by the 
rational and moral union that married people enjoy.  A 
lifetime of commitment, chosen and not dictated by 
instinct, sustained by determination in the face of obstacles, 
is the specifically human satisfaction of human sexual 
relations.  In that context, the human family is a reflection 
of the divine nature of man.

Rights: The Regime of the 'Discrete and Insular Minority,'"

Protection," Virginia Law Review 60:955-974.
  A national marketing survey indicates that the average 
homosexual enjoys a household income of more than 
$55,400, a figure $23,000 higher than the average American 
household.  Homosexuals are far more likely to hold a 
college degree, and far more likely to work in a professional 
or managerial position than average Americans.  They are 
more than four times as likely to travel overseas, or to earn 
over $100,000 annually.  See "Overcoming a Deep-Rooted 
Reluctance, More Firms Advertise to Gay Community," in 
The Wall Street Journal, July 18, 1991, p. B-1.

homosexuals who try to bend the Bible to support their 
case, see Harry V. Jaffa, Homosexuality and the Natural Law

Homosexuality Destiny or Choice?" Focus on the Family

Hamilton wrote that the "independence of the judges is 
equally requisite to guard the Constitution and the rights of 
individuals";  James Madison, in urging the First Congress of 
the United States to adopt a bill of rights, noted that 
"independent tribunals of justice will consider themselves in 
a peculiar manner the guardians of those rights."  1 Annals 
of Congress (Gales and Seaton, eds., 1834), p. 457.  For the 
Progressive view see J. Allen Smith, The Spirit of American 
Government, pp. 299-300: "In carrying out the original 
intent of the Constitution with reference to property the 
courts have developed and applied the doctrine of vested 
rights-a doctrine which has been used with telling effect for 
the purpose of defeating democratic reforms."
  Robert E. Brown, Charles Beard and the Constitution: A 
Critical Analysis of "An Economic Interpretation of the 
Constitution" (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1956).  
Using the same data that was used by Beard, Brown was able 
to show that as many members of the "predator classes" 
opposed the Constitution as supported it.
  In his essay "On the Jewish Question," Marx had pointed 
out that progressive taxes can be used by the state as an 
effective means to abolish private property:  "when men 
strive to liberate themselves through political emancipation, 
the state can, and must, proceed to abolish and destroy 
religion; but only in the same way as it proceeds to abolish 
private property, by declaring a maximum, by confiscation, 
or by progressive taxation, or in the same way as it proceeds 
to abolish life, by the guillotine" (emphasis original).  Robert

  In 1927, the Progressive historian Vernon Parrington 
made this remarkable reinterpretation of the American 
Founding: "The substitution of 'pursuit of happiness' for 
'property' [in the Declaration of Independence] marks a 
complete break with the Whiggish doctrine of property 
rights that Locke had bequeathed to the English middle 
class, and the substitution of a broader sociological 
conception; and it was this substitution that gave to the 
document the note of idealism which was to make its appeal 
so perennially human and vital."  In the view of Parrington, 
the radical welfare state had been present in America's most 
authoritative documents from the very beginning!  Main

3). The cash equivalent of her free health care was $450. 
(According to the California Department of Personnel 
Administration, the state paid $430 in 1992 to Foundation 
Health for HMO coverage for an employee family of three. I 
added $20 because Foundation coverage is more restrictive 
than Medicare and MediCal.) Her Section 8 housing voucher 
was worth $565. (According to HUD, the average one-
bedroom apartment in Los Angeles costs $704 in rent; I 
estimate $60 in utilities for a total of $764; a Section 8 
certificate is worth $764 minus 30% of cash income: $663 X 
30% = $199, and 764 minus 199 is 565.) Thanks to Jennifer

* Compiled by Thomas G. West, University of Dallas.
* Editors' Note: The idea for this appendix arose during a 
November 1992 segment of the television interview show, 
"Meet the Press."  Its purpose, like that of Appendix A, is to 
demonstrate that Bible-based religious faith is perfectly 
compatible with the principles and traditions of American 
democracy.  Indeed, it is much more so than the facile 
moral relativism of modern liberals.

<font size=3><b>The Impact Of The Ordinary Income Tax On Saving<br>
by <a href="/savers/library/tkbio.html">Tom Kelly</a></b></font><br>
<hr>

<b>Executive Summary</center></b>
<P>
The financial strength of taxpayers at all economic levels, as
well as the financial strength of our government and our nation,
is being increasingly eroded year after year by the taxation of
private savings and investment growth.  A change from the ordinary
income tax treatment of saving to an expanded IRA-type tax treatment
of saving would benefit the economy, the taxpayer, and ultimately
the Treasury, too, by promoting higher rates of saving and economic
growth.  An example based on historical market returns on savings
will illustrate this fact.
<P>
Two taxpayers invested $100 of after-tax income in an actual mutual
fund on January 1, 1926.  Sixty-seven years later on 12/31/92
both taxpayers sold their fund.  This sixty-seven year period
included depressions, recessions, wars, and good times, too. 
This period also provides a reasonable illustration of what the
reward to saving might be in the many decades ahead.
<P>
Let's assume that one taxpayer, Larry Lo-bracket, was always in
the 15% tax bracket, and the other, Harry Hi-bracket, was always
in the 50% tax bracket (many, if not most, of those years had
tax brackets exceeding 50%).  On 12/31/92 Larry's $100 investment
was worth $57,708 and Harry's was only worth $9,195.  These compare
with values of $141,940 and $241,296 if Larry's and Harry's income
and investment <I>had not been subjected to the ordinary income
tax.</I>
<P>
In short, the ordinary income tax reduced Larry's otherwise invested
capital by 59% and Harry's by 96%!  Interestingly, Larry Lo-bracket's
loss was <I>four</I> times his tax bracket, and Harry Hi-bracket's
loss was <I>two</I> times his tax bracket!
<P>
In contrast, under a tax-deductible IRA-type plan, Larry would
have avoided the 15% tax ($17.65) on his income, and, thus, his
investment would have been $117.65.  Harry would have avoided
the 50% tax ($100) on his income, and his investment would have
been $200.00.  These larger investments provide the proper IRA
comparison with a $100 after-tax investment by each taxpayer under
the ordinary income tax.
<P>
Larry's <I>after-tax</I> value under the IRA-type plan on 12/31/92
would have been $120,649, <I>as would have Harry's.</I>  The $120,649
after-tax value for each man equals 85% of the $141,940 untaxed
value for Larry and 50% of the $241,298 untaxed value for Harry
(see above).  Larry's loss due to taxes was equal to his tax bracket
(15%), and Harry's loss due to taxes was equal to his tax bracket
(50%).  This is fair and proper taxation.
<P>
<I>As illustrated, under a tax-deductible IRA-type plan, both
men had the same after-tax value, $120,649, because each man's
out-of-pocket contribution consisted of $100, with the government
deferring its tax, i.e., $17.65 for Larry and $100 for Harry.</I>
<P>
Upon the IRA withdrawal on 12/31/92, the government not only recovered
its full tax deferral ($17.65 for Larry &amp; $100 for Harry),
it also enjoyed the entire untaxed, free-market investment return
on these tax deferred amounts.  While collecting the full free-market
growth on these IRA tax deductions, the government gave up the
yearly taxation of investment return and realized gain that it
would have otherwise collected under the ordinary income tax.
 <I>It is this yearly ordinary income tax on investment return
that punishes saving so harshly, and it is solely this second
layer of tax that is properly removed by tax-deductible IRAs.</I>
<P>
As illustrated above, each $100 of a taxpayer's IRA-type <I>net</I>
saving (i.e., <I>net</I> of the tax that's deferred) will enjoy
the same investment growth from the same investment <I>regardless
of tax bracket</I>.  This is so, because there is no further tax
on the <I>net</I> saving.  In short, this means that all of every
taxpayer's investment return and realized gain derived from <I>net
</I>IRA saving is received totally tax free.  This is sound economics,
as well as sound and fair tax treatment, because every dollar
of private saving adds equal economic value to our nation's success,
regardless of the source of the saving, be it from Larry Lo-bracket
or from Harry Hi-bracket.
<P>
The <I>new</I> saving generated by such a proper reversal of our
nation's existing and punitive ordinary income tax treatment of
saving will be very large and ongoing.
<P>
Clearly, the ordinary income tax destroys each taxpayer's investment
values that would otherwise be available for his or her own future
use.  The ordinary income tax also concurrently destroys the capital
available for the economy as a whole.  After all, capital saved
and invested by each taxpayer is used over and over again by others,
thereby generating more production, more jobs, and more taxes.
<P>
The negative bias of the ordinary income tax treatment of saving
has led to an increasing Congressional awareness that corrective
legislation must take place.  As a result, bipartisan legislation,
the Individual Investment Account Act, S. 929 and H.R. 3179, has
been sponsored in the 103rd Congress by Senator John Breaux (D-LA)
and Representative Jim McCrery (R-LA).  Briefly, this Act establishes
IRA-type accounts that permit-
<UL>
<LI>Unlimited tax deductions for all contributions by any taxpayer.<p>
<LI>No tax on the account's investment return or realized gain.<p>
<LI>No penalty taxes nor forced distributions at any age.  Taxes
are paid solely upon withdrawals.<p>
<LI>No income tax nor estate tax at death.  Beneficiary has benefactor's
tax basis.<p>
<LI>Up to $15,000 of tax-deferred &quot;rollover&quot; for first-time
home buyers.  The tax basis of the home is reduced by the rollover.<p>
<LI>The proceeds from the sale of a primary residence may be rolled
over without tax into the tax-deferred IRA-type account, including
the $125,000 tax-free home sale proceeds after age 55.  The account's
tax basis is increased by the former residence's tax basis and
the $125,000 tax-free proceeds.<p>
<LI>The tax-deductible purchase of life insurance, provided the
proceeds are added to the tax-deferred account.
</UL>
<P>
These universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-type plans without
penalty taxes and forced distributions will create such an upsurge
in new saving that any revenue loss will soon be outweighed by
the tax revenue gains arising from a greatly increased saving
rate.  Such increased saving leads to more investment, more production,
reduced costs of capital, more jobs, a higher standard of living,
and yes-more tax collections from sound economic growth.
<P>
The dynamic economic gains that flow from universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible IRAs can be measured in trillions of dollars of
increased GDP (Gross Domestic Product).  And, these GDP gains
translate into net dynamic tax revenue gains vs. the ordinary
income tax.  An appropriate report by the respected economics
consulting firm, Fiscal Associates, and included herein as Appendix
B, forecasts the static and dynamic economic results flowing from
the proposed legislation.
<P>
For example, three years after the adoption of universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible IRAs, a healthier economy would bring in about
$17 billion in new federal tax revenue.  This would offset all
but about $10 billion of static revenue loss, as measured in the
erroneous &quot;tax expenditure&quot; manner utilized by government
analysts.  Within eight years, the real dynamic gains would (a)
fully offset the government's erroneous static revenue losses
and (b)<I> increase most taxpayers' after-tax income by approximately
15% to 20%.</I>  The bulk (85%) of this increase in after-tax
income would flow to taxpayers (including joint returns) with
adjusted gross incomes of under $100,000 per year.
<P>
Further, in a relatively short period of time (years 2000 - 2010),
annual GDP would be $500 billion to $1 trillion higher than otherwise,
thereby creating up to an additional two million more jobs than
otherwise.  Because of faster economic growth, annual tax revenues
would gradually grow each year to 30 billion dollars higher than
otherwise by the year 2010.  By the year 2060, GDP would be $32
trillion higher than otherwise and over 5 million more jobs than
otherwise would be created.
<P>
It is relevant to point out that the government relies upon its
staff-formulated &quot;static&quot; tax expenditure figures when
tax legislation is being considered.  This static tax expenditure
methodology is seriously flawed in that, among other things, it
ignores rational taxpayer reactions to tax law change.
<P>
Moreover, the government's 1995 Budget document admits for the
first time that the present value of its static IRA tax expenditure
figures for 1994 overstates IRA costs by over three times!  Thus,
it can be observed that not only is the government's static method
for measuring revenue loss flawed, the government's own numbers,
even using its own erroneous static method, are three times too
high!  In real life, the more realistic &quot;dynamic&quot; tax
revenue forecasts, as portrayed in this analysis, are superior.
 
<P>
Enacting universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-type plans has
many very favorable, interrelated consequences for taxpayers,
our government, and our nation.  Similarly, there are often-heard
and generally superficial objections to expanding IRA-type plans.
These consequences and objections are addressed individually
and thoroughly in the &quot;perspectives&quot; section of this
analysis.
<P>
<U><I><b><center>Conclusions</I></U></b></center>
<UL>
<LI>The ordinary income tax as applied to saving and investing
imposes enormous, ever-growing economic losses on our nation.
The net result is an ongoing compounding of economic injury to
savers, workers, users of capital, and the Treasury itself.<p>
<LI>The existing governmental tax revenue estimation methods that
neglect the dynamics of saving, and hence completely mismeasure
the tax revenue impact of tax-deductible IRA-type plans, are a
major driving force of our nation's erroneous tax policy as applied
to saving.<p>
<LI>The government's existing methods of estimating tax revenues
from IRA-type plans must be scrapped in favor of a more accurate
estimating process.<p>
<LI>The next sixty-seven years of savings and investment results
will have economic ups and downs not unlike the past sixty-seven.
Thus, the economic results, as portrayed in this analysis, that
flow from continuing the ordinary income tax treatment of saving
are a reasonable harbinger of a dismal economic future for our
nation if this irrational taxation of saving is not corrected
promptly.  On the other hand, tax-deductible IRA-type saving helps
everyone-including the user of capital, the government, and our
nation-not just the taxpayer.<p>
<LI>IRA-type plans must be improved, expanded, and promoted.<p>
<LI>Rather than limiting and discouraging the use of tax-deductible
IRA-type plans by taxpayers, the government should remove all
tax impediments to these plans and extol their use by everyone.<p>
<LI>The ordinary income tax as applied to saving creates an ever-growing
atrophy of the economic strength of taxpayer/voters, the users
of capital, government, and our nation.  Expanded and improved
tax-deductible IRA-type plans will reverse this economic emaciation
and create sound, robust growth.

   <H1>McNamara's Anniversary Gift to Hanoi</H1>
   <H3>By Bruce Herschensohn</H3>

</center>

<P>
The political leaders of Hanoi were assured a joyful 20th 
Anniversary of their victory over South Vietnam after 
unwrapping a priceless gift.  It was a retrospective book of 
our involvement in Southeast Asia, authored by former 
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, in which one line 
takes precedence over all others:  . . .We were wrong, 
terribly wrong.

<P>
President Clinton, not unexpectedly, has praised the 
book and commended the courage it took to write it.

<P>
Don't for a moment believe that this is a book of self-
deprecation.  It is, instead, a book in which the author 
misses few opportunities to praise himself, even including 
a picture of a mountain he climbed in Wyoming.  He 
modestly concedes that President Johnson wrote in a letter 
that the President never liked or admired anyone more 
than Robert McNamara.  

<P>
It is written in the same kind of confusion in which he 
served as Secretary of Defense:  one sentence contradicts 
another sentence, one paragraph impugns another 
paragraph, one point is made with strength, and then 
nurtured with weakness.  Those with whom he worked, 
including Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, are criticized 
and complimented all at once.  It appears to be his way of 
covering all bases.  Mr. McNamara even devotes one short 
paragraph in praise of the Americans who gave their lives 
in Vietnam.  (It's on page 333 for those who may easily 
miss it.)

<P>
He further writes  that I do not know to this day 
whether I quit or was fired.  Maybe it was both. Maybe.  
Everything seems to be uncertain.  Nevertheless, when all 
the contradictory points, incidents, and dialogues are put 
aside, McNamara clearly blames President Johnson for 
not accepting much of  McNamara's wisdom.

<P>
The book, by its own omissions, encourages the spread 
of an American amnesia, a disease with which President 
Clinton has already been stricken.  Robert McNamara 
stops his history when he departed his job, thereby 
conveniently leaving out the evidence that we were not 
wrong, terribly wrong in becoming involved, but instead 
that our Congress was wrong, terribly wrong during the 
two-and-one-quarter years after our military came home.  
Those two-and-one-quarter years have been wiped from 
America's memory as our amnesia makes us believe that 
when our troops left, Vietnam fell.

<P>
It was January of 1973 when our military engagement 
ended under the Paris peace accords in which both sides 
agreed to be permitted to make periodic replacement of 
armaments, munitions and war material which have been 
destroyed, damaged, worn out or used up after the cease-
fire, on the basis of piece-for-piece. . . .  North Vietnam 
replaced their losses on a four-to-one ratio rather than 
keeping the agreement of piece-for-piece, and the 94th 
Congress of the United States voted against supplying any 
replacements for South Vietnam's losses, stopping all aid 
of any kind to both Cambodia and South Vietnam, making 
defeat inevitable.  In April of 1975, both nations fell.

<P>
We signed those accords because Chapter Four, 
Article Nine of the agreement states that the South 
Vietnamese people shall decide themselves the political 
future of South Vietnam through genuinely free and 
democratic elections under international supervision.  
Article Eleven stipulates the insurance of the democratic 
liberties of the people; personal freedom, freedom of 
speech, freedom of the press, freedom of meeting, 
freedom of organization, freedom of residence, freedom of 
work.

<P>
None of this is recorded in the McNamara book, nor 
will President Clinton remind the American people of 
those accords when, as expected, he gives diplomatic 
recognition to a government that to this day refuses to 
keep its word on an agreement that was the very reason we 
left Vietnam.

<P>
By McNamara concluding the book where he does 
there is no mention of the horrors that came about when 
the communists won the war.  There is not even a footnote 
recording the over one million fleeing boat people, the 
genocide in Cambodia, or the post-war concentration 
camps in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.  The morality of 
what we tried to do has been proven by the immorality of 
the victors.

<P>
In the chapter entitled <B>The Lessons of Vietnam</B>, he 
generously sets in print his recommendations for future 
foreign policy.  With the depth of a single piece of saran-
wrap, we are told that we should achieve a nuclear-free 
world in which multilateral decision-making takes place 
within a burden-sharing context, while we assure 
preservation of the global environment.  That should work. 

<P>
It's entirely possible that waiting for Robert McNamara 
to mature may take more time than patience will allow.  It 
is my hope, however, that the time will come when  he 
will review what he wrote in the mid-1990s and conclude 
that his anniversary gift to Hanoi was wrong, terribly 
wrong.

   <H1>Hitler vs. The United Nations</H1>
   <h2>Liberty and the Bosnian Conflict</h2>
   <H3>By Bruce Herschensohn</H3>

</center>

Hitler was born sixty years too early to serve his ambitions.  Had he come to power in the 1990s instead of the 1930s, he would have won.

<p>
In the 1990s he would have been faced with the United Nations organization and the current leadership of the United States, and they would have offered little resistance.  I do not mean to suggest that they would have done nothing:

<p>
The U.N. forces would have stood at the railway stations, monitoring the families that were split apart among screams and tears.  U.N. monitors would also have stationed themselves outside Buchenwald and Dachau to monitor smoke when it was seen coming from the crematoriums.  But their orders would have been not to take a side in the conflict.

<p>
The United States leadership would adamantly oppose any aid to Great Britain on the grounds that it would "Americanize" the war, and the President would reject any weapons going to the underground movements in Europe, saying this would only "cause the death of innocent civilians."

<p>
In the 1990s the U.S. Presidents foreign policy has turned the nation into a Maxi-Switzerland, with his perception of our military as little more than a uniformed Peace Corps.  But its not only the administration.  Prominent voices in the opposition party are saying that engagement in Bosnia would not be in our national interest.  Are they saying the prevention of genocide would not be in the interest of the people of the United States?  And both major political parties concur that we must not send in U.S. ground troops to help the 
victims of Serbian aggression.

<p>
Without the will, our power (if we still have it), means nothing.  Militarily, Rule Number One is never to announce what <i>will not</i> be done.

<p>
The larger tragedy of contemporary times is that the word "peace" is given more importance than the word "liberty."  As is always the case when peace takes precedence over liberty, neither are achieved.  It is only when liberty is paramount that liberty and peace can both be realized.

<p>
President Lincoln could have had peace easily, saving 500,000 American lives.  He could have done that by ordering U.S. troops from Fort Sumter and allowing South Carolina and any other state to secede from the Union.  And there would have been peace.

<p>
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt could have had peace if on the morning of December 8, 1941 he would have asked Congress, not for a Declaration of War, but for a Declaration of Accommodation with the Axis powers, as an Asian and European War would not be worth the death of one more American.  And we would have had peace.

<p>
President Bush could have had peace in this decade by allowing Sadam Hussein to keep his troops in Kuwait and to allow him entry into Bahrain, Qatar, and Oman.  Surely Sadam Hussein would have sold us oil as he would have needed the dollars.  And there would have been peace.

<p>
In all cases there would have been the peace of the slave for the many, the peace of the master for the few, and the peace of the grave for the rest.

<p>
As President Clinton rejects any troops to protect the Bosnian civilians, he does not rule out 25,000 U.S. troops to safeguard the U.N. forces.  Why does he care more about the uniformed who were misplaced there by the U.N. than about the civilians who were born there--or who went there to be in a U.N. "safe area"?

<p>
What should we do?

<p>
Ignore the U.N.  Lift the arms embargo.  And with or without NATO, bomb all military targets of the Serbs, including all missile deployments, all anti-aircraft sites, all roads, supply lines, bridges, and arms factories, whether in Bosnia or Serbia, all the way to Belgrade with no privileged sanctuaries.  (The lesson we should have learned from the Vietnam war.)  And we should be willing to send in ground troops if necessary after the bombing, and make our willingness known.

<p>
Why should we do this?

<p>
Because were alive at this time.  Our obligation as human beings is to stop the atrocities of which we once said, "Never again."

<p>
But we said that a long time ago.  It was, after all, more than a half century ago that Hitler encountered a difficulty too large for him to overcome. The difficulty was that back then there were leaders in the world who held liberty as the most cherished human right.

What should every schoolchild know about the history of this land of liberty we call America?  The National History Standards Project, sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the U.S. Education Department, attempted to provide an answer to this
question; however, their report, released in late 1994, contains serious omissions and amusing political correctness.  In response, the Family Research Council prepared <I> Let Freedom Ring!, </I>an outline of U.S. history that avoids political fashion and emphasizes real knowledge of America's past.

   <H1><i>United States v. Lopez</i></H1>
   <h2>Restoring a Constitutionally Limited Government</h2>
   <H3>By Edward J. Erler</H3>

</center>

<p>
For the first time in more than sixty years, the Supreme Court has put restrictions on Congress' 
use of the Commerce Clause.  Under the Constitution, Congress is delegated the exclusive power 
to regulate Commerce with foreign nations, and among the states.  Since the New Deal 
revolution, the Supreme Court has allowed Congress to regulate those purely state and local 
matters that substantially affect commerce between states either directly or indirectly.  


<p>
Accordingly, in <i>Wickard v. Filburn</i> (1942) the Court upheld a fine assessed against a farmer who 
planted 12 acres of wheat in excess of the allotment permitted under the federal Agricultural 
Adjustment Act of 1938, even though the excess wheat was used only for private consumption.  
As the Court noted, the wheat supplied a need of the man who grew it which would otherwise be 
fulfilled by purchases in the open market.  Homegrown wheat in this sense competes with wheat 
in commerce.  


<p>
In the intervening years, the Court has routinely deferred to the judgment of Congress whether 
the regulated activity, although on its face not obviously related to interstate commerce, 
nonetheless substantially affected interstate commerce.  The result has been a tremendous 
expansion of centralized federal power over the states.  


<p>
The Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>United States v. Lopez</i> signals that Congress may no 
longer have unlimited discretion to expand its power under the Commerce Clause.


<p>
At issue in <i>Lopez</i> was a challenge to the Gun Free School Zones Act of 1990, which made it a 
federal offense for any individual to possess a firearm at a place that the individual knows is a 
school zone.  Almost all states have laws prohibiting guns in or near schools, and in the Lopez 
case a state indictment was dismissed in order for federal charges to be brought.  


<p>
Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for a 5-4 majority, declared the act unconstitutional because it 
neither regulates a commercial activity nor contains a requirement that the possession be 
connected in any way to interstate commerce.  In oral argument, the government maintained that 
the presence of guns in schools so disrupts the quality of education that economic activities are 
affected.  Future citizens will be less educated and consequently less productive; the cumulative 
affect on the nation's economic well being will thus be  substantial.


<p>
The danger of accepting such a weak causal argument was pointed out by the Chief Justice.  It 
would allow Congress to regulate <i>any</i> activity that it found was related to the economic 
productivity of individual citizens; including family law (marriage, divorce, and child custody).  
Indeed, the Chief Justice rightly concluded that under the Government's theory it would be 
difficult to perceive any limitation on federal power, even in areas such as criminal law 
enforcement or education where states historically have been sovereign.


<p>
The appropriate constitutional argument was detailed in Justice Thomas' incisive concurring 
opinion.  Thomas noted that in adopting the substantial affects test the Court has drifted far from 
the original understanding of the Commerce Clause.  Indeed, taken to its logical extreme, the 
substantial affects test would give Congress police power over all aspects of American life.  


<p>
Thomas notes that the Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence comes close to turning the Tenth 
Amendment on its head.  The Tenth Amendment generally reserves the powers not delegated to 
the federal government to the states or to the people.  This is a confirmation of the fact that the 
Federal Government is limited to the exercise of constitutionally delegated powers or to those 
that are reasonably inferred to be a necessary and proper exercise of delegated powers.  


<p>
As Thomas rightly points out, the Commerce Clause that emerged from the New Deal revolution 
allows Congress to exercise all powers not specifically prohibited, thus reversing the federal 
relationship contemplated by the Framers of the Constitution.  The New Deal interpretation of 
the Commerce Clause was explicitly calculated to allow the federal government to extend and 
magnify the reach of its regulatory powers.  


<p>
<i>Lopez</i> is a welcome reevaluation of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause, and it may 
well presage the beginning of a series of decisions that will reestablish the federal relationship as 
envisioned by the Framers.  The threat posed to the administrative state by the Court's decision 
may be gauged by President Clinton's frantic reaction.  Not only has the President severely 
criticized the <i>Lopez</i> decision, but he has also ordered the Attorney General to find a way around 
the ruling!

Liberal Republicans in the Senate are at it again, doing their best to derail the conservative
revolution -- and if you don't call or write today, they'll get away with it!<p>

Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, has introduced and passed an appropriations
bill for the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services that reverses the hard-fought
gains we made during House consideration of the measure last month.  <p>

The bill as it came out of the House was the single most dramatic example of the conservative
revolution at work.  Among other things, the House version of the Labor-HHS appropriations
bill:<p>
<ul>
     <li>Ended welfare for lobbyists by placing new restrictions on taxpayer funding for political
     advocacy groups;<br>
    <li> Terminated funding for the Office of the Surgeon General;<br>
     <li>Ended taxpayer financing of abortions through Medicaid;<br>
     <li>Abolished the liberal Goals 2000 Program;<br>
    <li> Overturned President Clinton's executive order barring the use of striker replacements by
     federal contractors;<br>
    <li> Established tough new restrictions on the regulatory authority of OSHA and the NLRB.<br>
</ul>
But Senator Specter stopped the train in its tracks!<p>

Senator Specter -- who has a lifetime ACU rating of just 39, making him the 4th most liberal
Republican in the Senate -- decided to sabotage the work of his party's members in the House,
and refused to even consider any of these tough legislative riders.<p>

As you read this, the Specter version of the appropriations measure may already have passed the
full Senate -- but it's not over yet, because the two competing versions will still have to be
reconciled in a House-Senate Conference Committee.<p>

Call,  write or fax Senator Specter today, and let him know what you think of his arbitrary and
capricious decision to abandon his party's principles and support higher spending, more
regulation, and other failed liberal policies.<p>

You can reach him at:<br><br>

     SENATOR ARLEN SPECTER<br>
     530 Hart Senate Office Building<br>
     Washington, D.C.  20510-Concord, N.H. 03301<br>
     Phone:  (202) 224-4254   FAX (202) 224-1893<br><br>

Or, if you'd like, email your thoughts directly to the Senator at <a href="mailto:Specter@bizserve.com">Specter@bizserve.com</a>
<p>

Remember, it's not too late to act -- but to have an impact on this debate, you must call or write
Senator Specter today!<p>

Tell him you want him to support the original House-passed language in the Labor-HHS
appropriations bill.  Demand that he do his part to further the progress of the conservative
revolution, and overturn four decades' worth of failed liberal policies.<p>

Call or write Senator Specter TODAY and let him know just you think about his decision to
become a turncoat Republican.<p>

Together, we can fight Senator Specter's plan to let business as usual reign on in Washington. 
We'll keep putting the pressure on him here in Washington, but we need the help of good
conservatives like you to make it work at the grass-roots level.  <p>

So contact Senator Specter TODAY, and we'll be able to get a good, tough Labor-HHS
appropriations bill, like the one they originally passed in the House.<p>


Remember -- Senator Specter is running for President. If he has a campaign office in your state,
call there, too.<p>

<CENTER><H3> End Federally Funded Abortion</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  There are 13 appropriations bills that fund U.S. government agencies and pro-grams.  These bills are voted on annually, and they originate in the House of Representatives.  During the Clinton administration, federal money has been used directly or indirectly for abortion through various appropriations.  The 104th Congress, however, has the opportunity to delete this funding or restore previous restrictions on tax dollars paying for abortion.  Also, the House Leadership has instructed the appropriations subcommittees to cut funding for programs that have not been "reauthorized" or approved by separate legislative committees.  For example, the Title X family planning program has not been reauthorized since 1985, but it continues to receive funding through the appropriations process.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee is Rep. Bob Livingston (R-LA).  However, legislative action takes place first in various Appropriations subcommittees that have jurisdiction over the particular department or programs.  The sub-committee chairman plays a key role and can include the desired language in the subcommittee "mark", or bill.  A subcommittee version goes to the full committee for consideration and then to the House floor.  The key subcommittees and chairmen are:  Labor/HHS/Education (Rep. John Porter [R-Ill.]); Treasury, Postal Service, General Government (Rep. Jim Lightfoot [R-Iowa]); and District of Columbia (Rep. Jim Walsh [R-N.Y.]).
	<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Since the government's new fiscal year begins on October 1, these bills will be in the forefront during the next few months.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  
<P>
<UL> 
<LI>The current Hyde amendment applies only to programs under the jurisdiction of the Department of Health and Human Services, such as Medicaid.  The Hyde language was "expanded" in 1993 to include payment for abortions in the case of rape and incest.  The fiscal year 1995 Labor/HHS bill contained this language.
<P>
<LI>A key issue to be decided will be language introduced by Rep. Ernest Istook (R-OK) that blocks the Clinton administration's interpretation of the "expanded" Hyde language.  Under that interpretation, the state pays for poor women's abortions whenever the abortionist claims the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.  Many states have stricter policies, allowing payment only in the case where the mother's life is endangered.  Rep. Istook tried to offer this corrective amendment during the "first 100 days" of Congress, but was persuaded not to and was promised a vote later in the year.
<P>
<LI>Also, attempts will be made to cut funding via the National Institutes for Health for human fetal tissue research, human embryo research, and RU-486 research.  Furthermore, Rep. Tom DeLay may offer an amendment to eliminate Title X family planning, which funds Planned Parenthood and distributes contraceptives to teens without parental permission.   The Senate Budget Resolution recommended defunding the Office of Surgeon General.  If the Appropriations Committee follows through, Dr. Henry Foster will have no job as Surgeon General, whether or not he is confirmed by the Senate. 
<P>
<LI>The Fiscal Year 1995 appropriations for Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government did not contain language prohibiting participating health plans from paying for Federal employees' abortions through the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHBP) program.  FEHBP provides health care benefits for 9 million federal employees.  The government (taxpayers) pays about 60 percent of the cost and the employee pays the rest.  In previous years, the Smith/Ashbrook amendment had been attached which restricted FEHBP-participating health plans from funding abortion.  This language should be reinstated.
<P>
<LI>The Fiscal Year 1995 District of Columbia appropriations contains a prohibition on the use of  "federal" funds to pay for abortions, which is meaningless, since DC can use "local"  funds.  These funds are commingled with federal funds since DC's funds are appropriated by the U.S. Congress.  Language is needed to ban all congressionally appropriated funds, both "federal" and "local," for abortion on demand in the nation's capital, a city where the number of abortions is comparable to the number of live births.
</UL><P>
<B> PROSPECTS:  </B> Majority support should be there for these appropriations bills in the House, but that will not be the case in the Senate.  In the first test vote on abortion in the House on May 24, the pro-life position (an amendment offered to the foreign aid bill by Rep. Chris Smith) prevailed by 59 votes.  President Clinton must sign the appropriations bills if he wants the money to run the government for fiscal year 1996.  

<P>
<LI><B> Prohibit D & X Abortions</B>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  To ban a particularly heinous method used to perform late-term "partial birth" abortions carried out on unborn children as early as 20 weeks of gestation and as late as 32 weeks.   
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.), Chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Constitution, along with Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) will introduce legislation in early June to ban "partial birth" abortions, or as they are more commonly known, "dilation and extraction" or "D & X" abortions.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House Subcommittee on the Constitution held a hearing on June 15 which focused on the D & X abortion procedure, fetal pain, and a constitutional analysis of the legislation.   
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  American Medical News, (July 5, 1993) devoted a front-page article to the gruesome D & X abortion procedure.  The article explained the step-by-step procedure.  First, the unborn baby's legs are pulled into the birth canal.  Next, the abortionist delivers the baby's entire body, except for the head.  The abortionist jams scissors into the baby's head, inserts a catheter and sucks the brains out.  The dead baby is then "evacuated."  
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  As a starting point, this legislation seeks to build public support for further prohibitions and an ultimate ban on all elective (non-life-of-the-mother) abortions.  While specifically intending to prohibit late-term abortions, this legislation and corresponding Congressional hearings will educate the public about the humanity of the unborn child and the horror of abortion.  Sadly, this basic public education is still greatly needed.  There should be widespread support for this measure, although some will argue that abortion is legal and that this is not a common procedure because late-term abortions are "rare."
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Retain Forced-Abortion Asylum Policy </H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Language included in the pending foreign aid and State Department reauthorization bill (H.R. 1561) would reinstate a Reagan-Bush policy that provided asylum to those who can prove a well-founded fear of persecution for resisting the People's Republic of China's grotesque and coercive population control program. 
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) added this language to the foreign aid bill when it was before the International Operations and Human Rights Subcommittee in May.  Rep. Smith is the subcommittee chairman.  The provision remained intact throughout the full committee's deliberations and became part of the foreign aid bill, known as the American Overseas Interests Act (H.R. 1561), to be considered by the House of Representatives. 
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Col.) will likely seek to delete this key provision on the House floor when the House resumes consideration of H.R. 1561.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Despite fears by some anti-immigration groups that the number of immigrants entering this country will soar, it is important to note that from 1987 through 1993, when the forced-abortion asylum policy was in effect, less than 200 people per year were granted asylum on these grounds.  This is a humanitarian policy and should be reinstated.  President Clinton revoked this pro-life policy soon after he took office.  This policy has real implications for Chinese families living in the U.S. who face imminent deportation and persecution, if it is not adopted quickly.  On Good Friday (April 14), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) moved 13 Chinese women to a deportation holding center in Bakersfield, Calif.  Five of these women had fled China after being forced to have abortions.  Others had been forcibly sterilized, or had escaped after being ordered to undergo abortions and/or sterilization.  It appears that their deportation is imminent unless Congress passes H.R. 1561 with the forced-abortion asylum provision intact.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The anti-immigration lobbyists are stirring up some fears, but the fact that a militantly "pro-choice" Member of Congress (Rep. Patricia Schroeder) is their champion undercuts their ability to appeal to the pro-life majority in the House.  Rep. Schroeder will be hard-pressed to explain why she isn't more sensitive to the fact that Chinese women don't have any "choice" about abortion.  However, President Clinton has threatened to veto H.R. 1561 for other reasons, mainly because it significantly cuts foreign aid.  If the House cannot override the veto, Rep. Smith would have to find another vehicle to enact the forced-abortion asylum policy.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Adopt the $5,000 Adoption Tax Credit </H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The $5,000 adoption tax credit is a pro-family measure that would help to reduce some of the financial obstacles associated with adopting a child.  It enjoys strong support in the House, but has weaker support in the Senate. 
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The $5,000 adoption tax credit was a primary component of the House GOP's Contract with America.  The provision -- adapted from Rep. Chris Smith's (R-N.J.) Omnibus Adoption Act, H.R. 1066 -- was passed by the House as part of H.R. 1215, the tax cuts package sponsored by Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tex.) and unveiled before an FRC audience.
<P>
<B> BUDGET RESOLUTIONS</B>:  In order to make the $5,000 adoption tax credit a reality, the provision must be included in the budget for each fiscal year.  The first step in that process is the budget resolution, which serves as a blueprint for the appropriating of funds in the final budget.  The House recently passed an historic budget resolution for fiscal year 1996, sponsored by Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio).  The resolution balances the budget by the year 2002, and includes the $5,000 adoption tax credit in its proposed tax cuts.
<P>
In contrast, the Senate's budget resolution would balance the budget by 2002 but failed to include the adoption tax credit (or any other tax cuts).  Sen. Phil Gramm's (R-Tex.) tax relief amendment (which included the adoption tax credit) was defeated by a vote of 69-31.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House and Senate versions of the budget resolutions will now be melded together to produce one budget known as reconciliation.  It remains to be seen whether the $5,000-per-child adoption tax credit will be maintained in the final version.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  This provision would make adoption a more affordable choice for prospective adoptive parents by allowing them to receive a tax credit of up to $5,000 for quali-fied adoption expenses, including adoption fees, court costs, and attorney fees, among others.  This provision is important because it reduces the financial obstacles that might otherwise hinder middle- and low-income families from adopting.  [The average cost of an adoption is between $10,000 and $15,000.]  It is also an important step in encouraging the adoption choice -- a choice which benefits the birth mother, the adopted child, and the adoptive parents.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Much depends upon the reconciliation of the two budget resolution versions.  If the Senate and, most especially, the members of the House-Senate conference committee on the budget can be convinced of the importance of pro-family tax cuts, prospects are good for the passage of the $5,000 adoption tax credit.
<CENTER><H3> Coercive Abortion Training Threatens Accreditation of Hospitals </H3></CENTER>
<P>
On February 14, 1995 the 23-member Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) voted unanimously to pass new regulations mandating that all medical residents specializing in obstetrics and gynecology be trained to perform elective abortions.  Individual residents expressing moral and/or religious objections to abortion would, presumably, be able to opt out of the abortion training, but common sense suggests that they will face strong pressure to undergo the new "standard" training.  Medical schools with a religious affiliation that oppose abortion would not be required to provide abortion training directly, but they would be required to arrange for such training for those students who do not object.  Many religious medical schools currently reject any affiliation whatsoever with abortion providers.  
<P>
Programs which fail to comply with the new regulations risk losing their accreditation.   However, over the last 20 years, the number of medical schools offering elective abortion training to their residents has declined.  In 1976, 92.5 percent of U.S. medical schools offered first-trimester abortion training, either on a routine or optional basis.  In 1991, 68.8 percent of medical schools offered first-trimester abortion training.  About one third of medical schools refuse to provide abortion training due to moral and/or legal reasons. 
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R-Mich.) plans to offer legislation in June that would reverse this coercive directive.  The legislation would "protect individuals, entities and programs from discrimination on the basis of their refusal to be trained, to train, or to arrange for training in the performance of induced abortion."  Senator Dan Coats (R-Ind.) is prepared to introduce similar legislation in the Senate. 
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House Economic and Educational Opportunities Oversight and Investigations subcommittee examined this issue during a hearing on June 14.  Witnesses included several medical directors of OB/GYN departments at public universities or hospitals who oppose the new requirement and a representative from ACGME.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Congressional action is necessary to reverse this coercive policy.  Accreditation status qualifies teaching hospitals to receive federal reimbursement (from Medicare and Medicaid) for services which medical residents provide to patients.  Moreover, doctors must ordinarily graduate from accredited training programs to get certified as competent in their specialties.  
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS:  </B> Rep. Hoekstra's legislation may be attached as an amendment to health care legislation, such as the Health Professions Education Consolidation and Reauthorization Act.

</CENTER><P><CENTER><H3> Getting Back to the Basics:  Disestablishing the U.S. Education Department</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Education has been traditionally -- and constitutionally -- a responsibility of states and localities.  But since the U.S. Education Department was founded in 1979, it has followed the iron law of bureaucracies, seeking to expand its range and influence.  Legislation is needed to take educational decisions from the hands of federal bureaucrats and return them to parents, teachers, and communities.
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  On May 24, 1995, the Back to the Basics Education Reform Bill was introduced.  This bill's main sponsors are Joe Scarborough (R-Fla.), Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), 
and John Boehner (R-Ohio).  Members of the House Education Task Force are among the cosponsors.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Within one year of passage, this bill would shut down the U.S. Education Department.  Many programs, including Goals 2000, would be repealed, while general funding for elementary/secondary and higher education would be converted to two block grants for the states.  The only stipulation is that 98 percent of a state's block grant be passed on to the local level.  Authorization for the block grants would last just three years, at which time the bill proposes that a tax cut for families replace the block grants.  A few functions of the Department would be transferred to more appropriate agencies:  Impact Aid to the Department of Defense, Indian Education to the Department of the Interior, Civil Rights to the Department of Justice, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and student loan programs to the Department of Health and Human Services.  The proposal goes beyond talk of shuffling offices and putting a new sign on the door; it takes a serious step towards removing the federal government from our schools.  The proposed tax cut would further reduce the government's influence over education.  Increased revenue for parents would empower them to make more decisions about their children's education.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  President Bill Clinton has already promised the National Education Association (NEA) that he would "remember who put me here."  He will clearly veto legislation that eliminates the NEA's primary representative in the federal government, the Education Department.  However, the executive office cannot authorize expenditures which have not been appropriated by the House.  The House Republican Budget Resolution zeroes out funding for the U.S. Education Department by 2002.  That improves the prospects for the Back to the Basics Education Reform Bill.
<P>


<P>
<CENTER><H3> Getting Back to the Basics:  Repealing Goals 2000</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Ignoring parental pleas for education to get "back to the basics," the 103rd Congress adopted Goals 2000, a program which further centralized education, increased bureau-cracy, and added a host of new non-academic programs.  It was described by supporters as a new pattern for local-state-federal partnership in education.  The debate has now shifted to limiting the federal role in education.  Goals 2000, representing the height of federal intrusiveness into schools, should be the first program to be dismantled.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  On May 10, Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) offered an amendment in 
the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee to repeal Goals 2000.  The committee did not vote on the motion at that time, but Rep. Graham plans to raise the issue again later this year.  That same day, the committee voted in favor of H.R. 1045, a bill to abolish the National Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC), which was created by 
Goals 2000.  Opportunities Committee chairman Bill Goodling (R-Penn.) is sponsoring the bill. 
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  H.R. 1045 was introduced on February 24, 1995.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House passed H.R. 1045 soon after the bill was reported out of committee.  Legislation to remove the opportunity-to-learn (OTL) standards from the law may be introduced later this summer.  A bill to repeal the whole law should appear later this year.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  NESIC would have functioned much like a national school board by reviewing and certifying state and national standards.  There is a general consensus that this is an inappropriate function for the federal government.  OTL standards shift the focus of reform back to increasing inputs into education, which requires increased spending.  We know that spending does not drive academic performance.  OTL standards should be removed from the law.  However, the Goals 2000 agenda will carry on as long as block grants to states continue.  Education reform at this historic moment calls for a reduction in the role of the federal government in American schools and a return to the traditional role of school:  teaching students the basics like reading, writing, and arithmetic.  A decisive first step will be the repeal of Goals 2000, which subverts education reform with more federal regulation and spending.     
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  H.R. 1045 should see minimal opposition, but the U.S. Education Department will fight fiercely to maintain its new conduit for imposing policy on the local school:  Goals 2000.  But the department is on the defensive.  Gov. George Allen of Virginia has announced that he will not accept Goals 2000 funding for his state.  Across the nation, parents are outraged by the implentation of Goals 2000 in their local schools.  The U.S. Education Department's new partnership has turned against them:  it is being attacked from all sides -- federal, state, and local.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Promote Parental Choice in Education </H3>
</CENTER><P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  As evidence of the academic failure of our monopoly public school system mounts, legislation is needed to help parents choose a safe, academically successful public, private, religious or home school for their children. 
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) and Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) have introduced S. 618, a bill to spend $30 million on 10-20 demonstration projects.  It would allow low-income parents of students in inner-city schools to choose among public, private, and religious schools.  In addition, FRC is considering alternative legislation to grant a tax credit to parents who choose private, religious or home schools or who select a public school different from the one to which their children have been assigned. 
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  March 24, 1995 (Coats-Lieberman).
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Coats-Lieberman is in committee. 
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Sens. Coats and Lieberman offered this legislation in the 103rd Congress.  It was narrowly defeated in the Senate last year (52-41).  Their proposal has since gained the interest and support of prominent columnists, such as neoconservative Ben Wattenberg and E.J. Dionne, writer for the liberal Washington Post.  The purpose of the bill is to fund what are called demonstration projects.  Sponsors believe that when poor parents choose schools, the evidence we gain from this experiment will be so positive and so compelling as to clinch the argument for parental choice in education.  Because this bill would benefit low-income, inner-city students, who are disproportionately minority children, its backers believe that the idea will overwhelm the usual liberal case against parental choice.  Advocates of the public school monopoly generally argue that parental choice in education is elitist, that it will "re-segregate" the public schools, that private and religious schools merely "skim off" the best students.  Some pro-family advocates, however, argue that the Coats-Lieberman bill would expand the federal role in education at a time when the goal of dis-establishing the U.S. Education Department is a higher priority.  A better solution at the federal level may be tuition tax credits.  FRC is considering legislation which would allow all parents to retain a portion of their earnings for the purpose of selecting safe, excellent schools for their children.  This legislation would enable parents to select among public, private, religious or home schools.  It would protect the integrity of independent schools since there would be no cash transfer from the government to the schools. 
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Despite arranging for quality private schools for their own children, Bill Clinton and Al Gore will vigorously oppose parental choice legislation which includes non-public schools.  Coats-Lieberman therefore faces a veto threat.  Tuition tax credit legislation would face a gauntlet of liberal opposition and senators who stubbornly regard any family tax relief as a "giveaway,"  but it could benefit by being referred to a more friendly committee.

<CENTER><H3> Adopt the $500 Per-Child Tax Credit</H3>
</CENTER><P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The $500 per-child tax credit is a pro-family measure that would help to relieve some of the tax burden on parents.  It enjoys strong support in the House, but has weaker support in the Senate.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The $500 per-child tax credit was an integral part of the American Dream Restoration Act, the "crown jewel" of the Contract with America, which passed as part of H.R. 1215 (sponsored by Rep. Bill Archer [R-Tex.]).  The credit is non-refundable (meaning that it only reduces taxes; it does not provide cash welfare to those with no tax liability).  This serves to target the bulk of the tax savings to middle-income families in the 15 percent tax bracket.
<P>
The House recently passed its fiscal year 1996 resolution, sponsored by Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio), to balance the budget by the year 2002, and it includes the $500 per-child credit in its proposed tax cuts.  The Senate's resolution, though it also balances the budget by 2002, included no tax cuts, as Sen. Phil Gramm's (R-Tex.) amendment to add the per-child tax credit to the budget resolution was rejected in the Senate.  It remains to be seen whether or not the $500 per-child tax credit will survive once these budget resolutions are melded into one budget by the two houses.   
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> The fate of the $500 per-child tax credit is uncertain.  While Sen. Gramm's amendment to the budget resolution was defeated, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole has indicated that he intends to secure a significant per-child tax credit in the budget resolution conference committee meeting with the House.  In addition, Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) and Sen. Rod Grams (R-Minn.) have pledged to offer amendments on the Senate floor calling for the $500 per-child tax credit if the Senate Finance Committee, headed by Sen. Robert Packwood (R-Oreg.), continues to balk at offering pro-family tax relief.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  FRC has been calling on Congress to adopt pro-family tax relief for many years.  Today, the average family of four contributes 25 cents on every dollar in income taxes and payroll taxes to the U.S. government, compared to 2 cents on every dollar in 1950.  In light of this, the per-child tax credit is designed to help offset the extraordinary erosion in per-child income tax benefits over the last half-century.  Passage of significant pro-child tax relief should be a top priority in the ensuing months of Congress.  
<P>
Streamlining government spending and permitting families to keep more of their own income -- for things like dental appointments and clothing purchases and electric bills -- benefits both the national economy and the personal economy of families.  Immediate pro-family tax relief should be a part of any government plan to balance the budget and make government more efficient.  In the months to come, it will be interesting to see if the Congress as a whole and the Senate in particular heard Americans last November and will give American families the opportunity to keep more of their own money.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  At this point, the fate of the per-child tax credit is uncertain.  However, if the Senate and, most especially, the members of the conference committee on the budget can be convinced of the importance of pro-family tax cuts, prospects are good for passage of the $500 per-child tax credit.

<P>
<CENTER><H3> Broaden IRA Eligibility to Non-Employed Spouses</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  To help alleviate the financial burden on families in which one spouse stays at home.  Legislation to allow expansion of IRA benefits to non-employed spouses would help provide relief for families who choose to have one spouse stay at home and would recognize the important contribution that non-employed spouses make to the income production of employed spouses -- an acknowledgment commonly made in divorce settlements.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The Family Reinvestment Act (H.R. 1040), introduced by Rep. Bill Baker (R-Calif.), allows full-time homemakers and wage-earning spouses a deductible IRA contribution 
of up to $2,500 each; this was passed in the House as part of the Contract with America.  (Furthermore, this legislation permits families to borrow from their IRA for education expenses or to buy a home, with the provision that the funds be paid back to the family with interest.)  Similar legislation, the IRA Equity Bill (S. 287), has been introduced in the Senate by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex) and allows deductible contributions of up to $2,000 by non-employed spouses.  
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  It is important that the Senate pass legislation to help relieve the tax burden on families.  The House bill was passed as part of the Contract with America.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Along with the attractive idea of expanding the uses of IRAs to help free-up family finances (e.g., penalty-free withdrawals to cover major housing, education, and health expenses) is the proposal to broaden the eligibility of IRA's to include non-employed spouses.  While broadening the eligibility of IRA's in general would primarily benefit upper-middle- and upper-income taxpayers, a more targeted broadening of the eligibility to non-employed spouses would provide relief primarily to middle-income families with children -- those most in need of pro-family tax relief.  Currently, two-earner couples can claim almost twice the benefits as single-earner couples, penalizing those families who choose to stay home with their children and ignoring the significant contribution the full-time homemaker makes to the income production of the employed spouse.  Passage of legislation to help level the playing field for single-earner families is a key step to providing relief to American families.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The battle for IRA benefits for non-employed spouses must be won in the Senate, as pro-family House legislation has been passed already.  It is crucial that the Senate give priority to measures that promote pro-family tax relief. 
Support Medical Savings Accounts
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  In the ongoing effort to reform health care, it is important to support any positive measures which would make health care more cost-effective for families.  Medical savings accounts, or Medical IRAs, are one such measure.  Making the option of medical savings accounts available to employees and unemployed individuals would encourage more prudent use of health care dollars and promote greater family autonomy in health care decisions.
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  Reps. Bill Archer (R-Tex.) and Andrew Jacobs (D-Ind.) have formulated legislation promoting medical savings accounts.  The proposal would amend the existing tax laws to create cost-effective incentives for employers to offer, and for employees to choose, medical savings accounts.  Rep. Archer expects to introduce his bill in mid-June and has said that many of his colleagues in the House have expressed great interest in cosponsoring such legislation.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The bill is currently being "scored" by the Congressional Budget Office to see what impact, if any, the reform will have on the overall budget, e.g., whether it is budget-neutral,  whether it will save money, or whether it will require the allocation of additional federal funds.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Medical savings accounts (MSAs) are similar to individual retirement accounts (IRAs) in that pre-tax dollars up to a certain limit may be set aside for lower-level medical expenses to be controlled by and used by families.  MSAs usually supplement catastrophic health insurance coverage, helping to cover medical expenses before the insurance deductible is reached.  Because individuals are directly responsible for the use of their health care dollars, MSAs guard against the overutilization of health care services, thereby helping to curb skyrocketing health care costs.  Moreover, individuals reap the rewards of managing their health care dollars wisely and of practicing good habits, for any monies not spent by the end of the year may be kept by the individual as taxable income, or kept in the account for future health care needs.
<P>
MSAs also promote greater autonomy in health care choices.  Because MSA funds may be used toward any medical expenses, including those not expressly covered within the insurance deductible, an individual has more flexibility to choose health services and providers and more portability of coverage (i.e., ability to keep coverage even when changing jobs).
<P>
Furthermore, evidence indicates that MSAs work well.  Golden Rule Insurance company recently conducted a survey of their employees who are covered under MSA plans.  The results show that (1) MSA enrollees saved money and reduced overall health care spending, and that (2) MSA enrollees were highly satisfied with their plan -- fully 88 percent prefer the MSA plan to other health insurance plans they had in the past.
<P> 
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The idea of MSAs is not new; therefore, many members of Congress are already familiar with and support the concept.  MSAs should have a good chance of passage in the 104th Congress, especially considering the fact that MSAs were a key component in many Republicans' health care reform proposals last year.

<CENTER><H3> Implement the Gay Ban</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Most Americans thought the military homosexual issue was resolved with the passage of a law.  Wrong.  The Clinton Administration ignored the law when it wrote the implementing policies and lifted the ban anyway.  Now, the Administration is using the courts to get around public opinion and scuttle the ban by building a case that will lose in the Supreme Court.  That's why new legislation is imperative.
<P>
Pentagon and Justice Department officials have told FRC that what we thought was an exclusion policy is really an accommodation policy which permits homosexuals to serve.   So far, Congress has ignored this swindle by failing to exercise its constitutional responsibility to enforce military regulations.
<P>
The Pentagon policy that took effect February 28, 1994 differs in several ways from the law it purportedly implements:
<P>
<UL><LI>The law carries the statement, "homosexuality is incompatible with military service."  The Clinton regulations omit it. 
<P>
<LI>The law forbids service by homosexuals.  The Clinton regulations permit service by homosexuals.  At least 15 avowed homosexuals are now serving openly.
<P>
<LI>The law relies on commander discretion to initiate investigations.  But the Clinton regulations create a "criminal-like" standard.  According to Secretary of Defense William Perry, if soldiers attend gay pride parades, frequent gay bars, and possess gay materials, this does not constitute "credible" evidence to initiate an inquiry.
<P>
<LI>Contrary to 200 years of military experience and practice, Clinton's Defense Department no longer acknowledges homosexual behavior as a marker for increased security risk.  Information discovered during a security investigation cannot be used without high-level political permission.
<P>
<LI>Although the law permits asking about homosexual acts and orientation at the point of admission and whenever appropriate, the Clinton Administration refuses to do so.</UL>
<P>
In the first court test of the new law, the Clinton Justice Department failed to use key arguments and called no witnesses.  
<P>
On March 30, 1995, Judge Eugene Nickerson of the Eastern District of New York ignored volumes of case law precedents and struck down the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy.  The case is<I> Lieutenant Colonel Jane Able, et al. v. United States of America</I>.
<P>
The Justice Department did not bother to:
<P>
<UL><LI>Dispute biased research and testimony by "expert" pro-homosexual witnesses.
<P>
<LI>Present well-documented physical and psychological problems with homosexuality.
<P>
<LI>Show that homosexual "lifestyles" and "values" jeopardize morale and unit cohesion.
</UL><P>
FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP), with senior advisors former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas M. Moorer and former Marine Corps Commandant Robert H. Barrow, is lobbying Congress to amend the 1996 Defense Authorization Act.  Should the <I> Able </I>case be heard by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals before the law is changed, irreparable damage may be done.
<P>
FRC's MRP wants the following changes included in the 1996 Act:
<P>
<UL> <LI>Require the Secretary of Defense to ask all potential recruits whether they are a homosexual or have engaged or intend to engage in homosexual acts.
<P>
<LI>Require the Secretary of Defense to revoke current policy and issue regulations consistent with the law.
</UL><P>
TheDefense Authorization Act will come to a final vote in early August.  Some members want to avoid another debate over homosexuals in the military and will try to torpedo any amend-ments.  However, without legislation the courts will have the final say on an issue which  constitutionally belongs to the Congress.  And the Clinton Administration will continue to keep more homosexuals in the military, thus undermining combat readiness, legal defense of the ban, and the moral fabric of the nation.  The stakes are extremely high.  If the military falls, federal power will be used to validate the rest of the homosexual agenda, including gay "marriage" and adoption of children.
<P>
Senators Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) and Dan Coats (R-Ind.) have both expressed concern and may take legislative action.

<CENTER><H3> Cable Porn</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Some cable TV operators include channels featuring pornographic material in their basic cable subscriptions.  This increases access to pornography, particularly by young people.    
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Tony Hall (D-Ohio) and Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) introduced the Family Viewing Cable Television Act of 1995 (H.R. 1540) on May 2, 1995.  The bill forbids cable operators from including pornography in basic cable packages.  
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> H.R. 1540 is currently pending before the House Judiciary Committee but no hearings have been scheduled.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Currently, many consumers are forced to accept channels featuring pornography as part of their basic cable package.  This makes it more difficult for them to protect their children.  The bill would secure the right of parents to keep their television safe for family viewing.  It would not outlaw pornographic material on cable television.  Rather, the bill would merely prohibit operators from automatically including it in basic cable packages.  Consumers wishing to have pornographic channels on their cable systems would be free to do so, but they would simply have to request them from their cable company.  
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The bill is facing opposition from industry lobbyists and advocates of unrestricted free speech.  Supporters may offer it as an amendment to another bill if hearings are not scheduled soon.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Promote Porn-Free Technology</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The growth of technology has created many exciting opportunities.  Unfortunately, it is also being used to expand access to pornography.  Many on-line computer networks such as the Internet operate largely unregulated and are a virtual no-man's land where material is exchanged without regard to laws on obscenity and indecency.  Legislation is needed to bring computer networks into compliance with obscenity and pornography laws.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The Communications Decency Act of 1995 (S. 314) introduced by Sen. Jim Exon (D-Neb.)  
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  February 1, 1995.
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> The bill has been incorporated as an amendment to the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 (S. 652).  The telecommunications bill has been reported out of committee and is awaiting floor action. 
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The Communications Decency Act amends current dial-a-porn laws regulating obscenity and indecency to include computer technology.  Without questioning Sen. Exon's intentions, many pro-family groups, including the Family Research Council, fear that the bill in its present form might actually create more problems than it solves.  Computer industry lobbyists have hit Sen. Exon hard, resulting in significant weakening of S. 314 since February.  FRC and other groups are working with Sen. Exon and other senators to develop a strong law that incorporates the original goals of  S. 314.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  FRC will continue to work with Sen. Exon to try to restore S. 314.  Meanwhile, several alternative proposals are in the works.  Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) intends to add an amendment to the telecommunications bill which would instruct Attorney General Janet Reno to "study" the problem of computer porn.  Sen. Leahy's approach is a do-nothing approach which pro-family groups will oppose.  If Sen. Exon's bill does not improve, parents might see help from Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) or Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) who are working on solutions that are more in line with pro-family concerns.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Military Profits from Pornography</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Military exchange managers are responsible to select magazines based on sales volume, customer preferences, and, in the case of pornographic material, whether it fits the definition for "obscenity" outlined in the 1973 Supreme Court case of Miller v. California.  At present, the services oppose removing so-called "soft" pornography from exchange shelves because of  the perceived threat of legal action from the American Civil Liberties Union.  
<P>
Obscenity was legally defined by the Supreme Court in the Miller v. California decision.  According to this ruling, something is obscene and therefore unprotected by the First Amendment when it satisfies the following criteria:
<P>
<UL> <LI>Taken as a whole, appeals to a prurient interest in sex.
<P>
<LI>Depicts sexual conduct in a patently offensive manner.
<P>
<LI>Taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value.
</UL><P>
These criteria were written to protect freedom of speech and expression.  But there are kinds of speech and expression not protected by the Constitution: slander, libel, perjury, false advertising, conspiracy, yelling "fire" in a crowded theater, copyright violations and child pornography.  The military has determined that certain "soft" pornographic material is protected (not obscene) and should be sold to uniformed patrons in government stores.
<P>
Pornography is sexually explicit material intended to arouse the consumer.  It is addictive and very often leads men to sexual crime.  This fact should persuade military leaders to judge wisely between two competing outcomes: the damage attributable to addictive pornographic material versus an ACLU lawsuit.  For now, the government is more fearful of an ACLU lawsuit.  
<P>
The government has much experience selling addictive merchandise to military patrons.  For example, it has sold alcohol, a potentially addictive substance, to servicemembers for most of the military's 200-year history.  Admittedly, most alcohol users avoid addiction, but enough do become addicts and they cost the services dearly -- productivity losses, personal injury, judicial expenses and property damage.
<P>
Pornographic material is much like alcohol; it is a very powerful stimulant.  The consumer begins with limited exposure -- "soft" pornography sold in military stores.  In some cases a  desire for sexually explicit material grows to require more explicit, more deviant images for the consumer to reach a previous level of sexual stimulation.  Gradually the addict is desensitized to the more explicit material.  Finally, he may act out sexually his pornographic fantasies prompted by the material.  These activities may include compulsive promiscuity, exhibitionism, group sex, voyeurism, having sex with children, rape, or sadism.
<P>
Serial killer Ted Bundy stated just before his execution for the sexual assault and murder of many women, "You are going to kill me, and that will protect society from me.  But out there are many, many more people who are addicted to pornography, and you are doing nothing about that."  Bundy blames his addiction to pornography for his mental state that led to his murdering as many as 31 women.
<P>
No pending legislation mandates the removal of pornographic materials from military exchange shelves, but President Clinton has the unilateral authority to do so.  Military consumers can purchase the material without the government's help.

<CENTER><H3> Combat Illegitimacy in Welfare Policy</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE:  </B> The current welfare system promotes family breakdown by guaranteeing a right to cash benefits even if one engages in irresponsible conduct.  Moreover, the bureaucratic arrangements that spring up to administer those benefits supplant voluntary organizations that offer real help -- the kind of help that changes lives.  Any legislation that attempts to reform welfare must end the entitlement status of numerous welfare programs, including AFDC cash benefits, and afford states the maximum flexibility to experiment with anti-poverty efforts that impose behavioral requirements (charitable alternatives, in particular).
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  House bill, H.R. 4, "The Personal Responsibility Act."  Senate floor action is expected.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  In March, the House passed The Personal Responsibility Act as part of its Contract with America.  The welfare reform bill will reach the Senate floor later this summer.  While the Senate Finance Committee did vote to eliminate the federal guarantee of cash assistance in favor of a strategy that "block grants" money to the states, the committee bill fails to ensure that illegitimacy remains a prominent focus of the debate on the floor.  The House bill, H.R. 4, included three essential provisions to strengthen families:  a prohibition on cash payments to mothers under age 18 who bear children out of wedlock; a freeze on benefits for mothers who bear additional children while on welfare; and incentive bonus payments to states that reduce illegitimacy rates -- without increasing the number of abortions.  While the Senate bill does not include any of the essential provisions that were incorporated in the House bill, at least four senators have indicated that they will fight to restore the focus on family breakdown.  Family groups expect either Senator Bob Dole (R-Kans.) or Senator Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) to lead the  initiative.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Given the consequences for the individual child, the surrounding community, and the national polity, bringing a baby into this world without a sense of sacred responsibility cannot be regarded as a morally neutral act.  Congress should now recognize that it is also wrong to promote such activity by subsidizing it.
<P>
"The task," Charles Murray concludes, is to "neutralize whatever is impeding the age-old impulse of human beings to form families. . . .  A major change in the behavior of young women and the adults in their lives will occur only when the prospect of having a child out of wedlock is once again so immediately, tangibly punishing that it overrides everything else."  Eliminating grants to unwed teenage mothers will be necessary, though not sufficient, to restore the integrity of the family unit.  
<P>
Frances Perkins, chief architect of Franklin Roosevelt's welfare policy, opposed extending federal entitlements to unmarried mothers because she foresaw that subsidizing illegitimacy would escalate family breakdown.  It would be ironic at best if the current majority in Congress were to find themselves to the left of the most liberal member of the Roosevelt Administration, because they rejected that intuition, now confirmed by years of sad experience.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  While Congress is almost certain to pass a welfare bill this session, the fate of the illegitimacy provisions is uncertain.

<P>
<CENTER><H3> Zero Out Title X</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Title X of the Public Health Service Act was enacted in 1970 as a grant program to fund family planning projects throughout the country.  The program helped to spawn the proliferation of family planning clinics within states, granting federal sanction to the distribution of contraception to unmarried women and to minors without parental consent.  Having received over $193 million from taxpayers last year, funding for this unauthorized and failed program should be eliminated altogether.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Title X of the Public Health Service Act receives its funding through the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill which comes before Congress for a vote every year.  Neither the House nor Senate budget resolutions included a proposal to zero out Title X funding.  However, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) has promised to bring an amendment to the House floor to defund Title X if funding is not eliminated in committee.  Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and his state's Congressional colleagues, Reps. Ernest Istook and Steve Largent, are also working to zero out Title X funding.
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> Efforts to defund Title X are in progress. The Labor/HHS Appropriations bill will be considered by Congress this summer.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The reasons to defund Title X are numerous.  First of all, Title X should not continue to receive funding because it is an unauthorized program.  Its authorization expired in 1985.  Secondly, Title X is duplicative.  Several other programs such as Medicaid and the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant provide family planning to low-income and other targeted populations.  There is no clear basis for the federal government to run a categorical family planning program when state governments have the capability to set health care priorities within the parameters of an alternative block grant.  Finally and most importantly, Title X is a failed program.  Since the inception of Title X, out-of-wedlock births, abortions, and sexually-transmitted diseases have all risen dramatically, especially in the populations Title X is supposed to have targeted.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Expect a huge fight pitting pro-abortion, pro-contraception groups intent on saving Title X against pro-family, pro-life groups working to defund the program.  Because Planned Parenthood receives a good portion of Title X monies, expect them to launch a campaign to save the program.  Outcome of a floor fight is uncertain.
<P>
Another approach, which may or may not prevent a floor battle, could be far more effective.  Overall grant reform may eliminate Title X funding without targeting any specific program.  For example, Congress could pass a law saying that no funds shall be appropriated to any program unless that program is currently authorized.  This is a justifiable reform in light of the efforts to balance the budget and the recently passed law eliminating unfunded federal mandates to states.  Thus, Title X funding might be eliminated on the basis of its unauthorized status.  However, if such grant reform passes, it is probable that pro-abortion members of Congress may try to bring Title X up for reauthorization.  Prospects to successfully reauthorize Title X are slim.  However, without such grant reform, funds could still be appropriated to unauthorized programs.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Derail the AIDS Gravy Train</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The federal government, all told, is spending $7.1 billion on AIDS through several government agencies in fiscal 1995.  The Public Health Service alone spends about $2.9 billion yearly ($91,355 per AIDS death contrasted with $1,060 for every cancer death).  Other federal expenditures come from HUD, Social Security, Veterans Affairs, and the Agency for International Development.  Legislation is needed to bring AIDS spending in line with money spent on other terminal diseases such as cancer.  And AIDS funds should not go toward the promotion of homosexuality in the guise of  "AIDS education."  Time-tested epidemiological responses such as early diagnosis and partner tracing should be employed.
 <P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Congress seems prepared to take a business-as-usual approach to AIDS.  On April 3, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum's (R-Kans.) Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act (S. 641) provides $4.3 billion over the next five years, beginning in fiscal 1996, and allows for "such sums as may be necessary," a budget-busting possibility.  Other sponsors include Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kans.).  A House version was introduced by Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) on January 4, 1995.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The Senate bill was passed out of the Labor and Human Resources Committee.  Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) has put a legislative hold on the bill.  No hearings have been scheduled.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Much AIDS money goes to legitimate activities, such as HIV research and care for AIDS victims.  A significant amount, however, goes to politically active groups that promote the radical homosexual agenda.  Congress needs to hold hearings to examine how the money has been used so far.  All funding to groups that promote homosexuality should be cut, leaving more money for groups that deal with AIDS in a medically responsible fashion.  Current AIDS education funding should be terminated, since the money is going toward promotion of condoms and the myth of  "safe sex" instead of documentably successful abstinence education.  And spending formulas should be changed:
<P><OL> 
<LI>Only those infected with HIV or AIDS who need care should receive benefits.  Formulas based on "AIDS prevalence" distort funding needs, because they count the dead along with the living.  More of the money should go to under-served minority communities.
<P>
<LI>People with HIV or AIDS should qualify where they currently live, not where they were diagnosed.  Someone might be diagnosed in a large city but return home elsewhere for care.
<P>
<LI>Means testing for AIDS dollars should be introduced.  Those with adequate insurance should not be in the same pool with those who truly have no other means of payment.</OL>
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Fifty-five senators have signed on as sponsors, but hearings could result in positive changes.  Sen. Dole's role is pivotal if the bill's abuses are to be addressed.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Defund Federal Promotion of Homosexuality</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The Clinton Administration mandated AIDS/Awareness Training for all Federal employees.  Some of this training is used to promote homosexuality.  Legislation is needed to defund this training.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS: </B>  S. 25 -- To stop the waste of taxpayer funds on activities by government agencies to encourage their employees or officials to accept homosexuality as a legitimate or normal lifestyle.  Sponsor: Senator Jesse A. Helms (R-N.C.)
<P>
H.R. 862 -- To prohibit the use of Federal funds to promote homosexuality.  Sponsor: Represent-ative Robert K. Dornan (R-Calif.)
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  H.R. 862 -- was introduced February 8, 1995, and was assigned to the Subcommittee for Human Resources and Intergovernmental Affairs of the Government Reform and Oversight Committee. 
<P>
S. 25 --  was introduced January 4, 1995, but is unlikely to be voted on until late summer or 
early fall.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Congressman Dornan's strategy is to amend all appropriations bills to include this language.  H.R. 862 will not likely be passed as a stand-alone bill, and thus, the Senate strategy is likely to be similar.
<P>
<B> OVERVIEW</B>:  President Clinton directed all federal departments to provide HIV/AIDS training.   According to many federal employees, the mandatory training promotes homosexuality and includes unnecessarily graphic explanations.  A Defense Department worker complained that her training included a slide show of  "sex toys" and flavored condoms.  Other workers were lectured that their grandmothers probably had engaged in sodomy as a form of birth control.
<P>
Two supervisors and 41 employees in the Federal Communication Commission's audio services division chose not to attend mandatory "AIDS Awareness Training."  An FCC employee stated, "The classes are basically an adult version of high school sex ed., with the modern-day sensitivity training thrown in."
<P>
Department of Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary created "Walkin' the Talk" AIDS training materials for three-hour, mandatory training sessions.  A memo from the Department's Federal Workplace HIV/AIDS Education Coordinator states, "All employees are required to complete this training."
<P>
The training includes a brief history of HIV and a discussion of symptoms, prevention, and risk reduction.  There also is a discussion of needle-sharing and sexual contact.  Federal employees are told to reduce their HIV contraction risk by practicing "safer sex" by using barriers like condoms, dental dams, plastic wrap, and latex gloves.  The manual states, "A dental dam 
(a small, square piece of latex) or plastic wrap may be used for any oral-vaginal or oral-anal contact.  All types of barriers (condoms, dental dams, and plastic wrap) are effective against HIV transmission only if they are used correctly and consistently from start to finish."
<P>
The Energy Department makes a disclaimer: "HIV is transmitted without regard to gender, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, or identification with any group.  For this reason, we avoid referring to high risk groups."  Not identifying "high risk groups" is irresponsible.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report shows that at least 87 percent of AIDS victims either contracted the virus from homosexual encounters or by sharing needles.
<P>
Probably the most outrageous example of government-sponsored AIDS training was done for the Forest Service.  It took place in the Forest Service's Tahoe Region on May 6, 1994 and was conducted by a local health official with degrees in sexology, a self-described homosexual phlebotomist (individual who draws blood), and an HIV-positive woman from the community.
<P>
The phlebotomist was an ex-convict who tried to debunk "homophobic" misconceptions.  He speculated that many husbands were involved in homosexual affairs.  He showed a variety of condoms and how to apply them to a life-size replica of erect male genitalia.  He even explained a technique for using one's mouth to apply the condom.  He also explained the proper cleaning techniques when sharing hypodermic needles.
<P>
The Forest Service also has a training booklet entitled, "Valuing Diversity."  Inside the booklet are statements such as: "Fact: Psychological and social influences alone cannot cause homosexuality....Fact: A biological (genetic, hormonal, neurological, other) predisposition toward homosexual, bisexual, or heterosexual orientation is present at birth in all boys and girls."  No source for these "facts" is provided, nor could there be.  So-called genetic studies on homosexuality are flawed and typically conducted by homosexual activists.
<P>
AIDS/HIV awareness training and diversity training have become vehicles for promoting homosexuality in the federal government.

<CENTER><H3> Restore Combat Exemptions for Women</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Clinton administration has removed 250,000 combat exemptions for women.  Women can now be assigned to more than 80 percent of all military positions -- many combat-related.  Meanwhile, Congress has failed to host hearings to examine the recommendations of the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, which opposed many of the recent changes.  The Administration, with Congressional neglect, has advanced a feminist agenda without regard for readiness. 
<P>
Secretary of Defense William Perry promises, "Our over-arching goal is to maintain a high-quality, ready and effective force.  By increasing the numbers of units and positions to which women can be assigned, the military services gain greater flexibility in the development and use of human resources."
<P>
The Clinton Administration has not explained how liberalization of the female assignment policy will accomplish the goal of maintaining "a high-quality, ready and effective force."  According to Mr. Perry, these changes are intended to expand "the opportunities for women in the military."
<P>
The Administration's decisions to end more exemptions for women have no justification in military necessity and will hurt readiness:
<P><UL>
<LI>There is a sufficient number of male recruits, especially now that the military is downsizing.  
<P>
<LI>No new scientific studies refute the findings of the 1992 Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, which recommended that "military readiness should be the driving concern regarding assignment policies."
<P>
<LI>The American people still support a go-slow approach to expanding military roles for women.
<P>
<LI>America's likely adversaries still assign only men to their militaries because they know that national security interests cannot be sacrificed to social experimentation.</UL>
<P>
On October 6, 1994,  Representative Ike Skelton (D-Missouri) of the House Armed Service Committee's Subcommittee on Military Forces and Personnel hosted the only hearing since 1991 to consider assignment policies for women.  Although Mr. Skelton began the hearing by stating, "Women should not serve in direct ground combat," and, "I'm of the opinion that second place does not count on the battlefield," he limited the two-hour hearing to one three-member panel which supported the Administration's changes.  Rep. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) had asked to hear dissenting views from a panel of commissioners from the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces.  His request was denied.
<P>
Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution gives the Congress the responsibility to "raise and support armies" and to "provide and maintain a navy."  Congress also must make the rules and regulations that govern the military, and that includes the number of women in the military and their assignments.
<P>
The 104th Congress should conduct a thorough review of Pentagon policies and seek to reverse the Clinton administration's current course.  No hearings or bills are pending.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Off The Dole: No Taxpayer Support for Special Interests</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  In Washington, DC some of the most intensive lobbying is done by recipients of taxpayers' money.  Using the funds received from awards, grants and contracts, these government-created special interests lobby Congress for continued, and often increased, taxpayer support.  Moreover, many of the programs created are hostile to the values of the citizens whose money is used to fund them.
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  On March 3, 1995, Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Calif.) introduced the Integrity in Government Act (H.R. 1130), which would prohibit recipients of taxpayer money from lobbying for continuation of their funding.  The bill is currently cosponsored by Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) and Rep. Mel Hancock (R-Missouri).  
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The Integrity in Government Act is currently before the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The bill is designed to keep taxpayer money out of lobbyists' hands.  It is carefully worded so that it applies only to lobbying for continued support of various programs and agencies.  It does not apply to recipients of entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare.   Nothing in the legislation restricts or interferes with individual citizens' ability to communicate with their elected representatives.  
<P>
The Integrity in Government Act does not have many friends among the special interest groups that are so prevalent in Washington.  Many Members of Congress do not want to support the bill for fear of the money and power of these groups or because they like the idea of taxpayer money being used to lobby Congress for causes they favor.  
 <P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Although no hearings have been scheduled for the bill, supporters say they want to move forward with plans to attach similar legislation to each appropriation and authorization bill that comes up in Congress.  It is believed that attaching such an amendment to each appropriation and authorization will make it more difficult for special interests to oppose efforts at reform.

<CENTER><H3> Stem the Resurgence of Drug Abuse</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Drug abuse among teenagers has increased significantly in recent years.  This change is attributable to the culture's pro-drug influence, less-than-effective prevention programs, and President Clinton's silence on the issue.  The Administration's national drug strategy focuses on "harm reduction" --  treatment for chronic drug users and less enforcement.  Meanwhile, Congress may cut drug prevention programs.  Any long-term solution requires parental involvement, community programs, and strong national leadership. 
<P>
A nationwide survey by the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) in 1994 found that annual marijuana use among 8th graders rose from 6.2 percent in 1991 to 13 percent in 1994.  The trend is also evident among 10th (16.5 percent to 30.4 percent) and 12th (36.7 percent to 38.2 percent) graders.  And cocaine, crack, heroin, and LSD use among teenagers is also rising and may soon rival the high rates of the 1970s.
<P>
The largest rise is in marijuana abuse, possibly because it is perceived differently from the "hard" drugs.  Although some young people don't even consider marijuana a "drug,"  Dr. Carlton Turner, former NIDA director and head of the Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi, warns, "There is no other drug used or abused by man that has the staying power and broad cellular actions on the body that cannabis [marijuana] does."
<P>
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala states, "Young people must understand that there is clear scientific evidence that marijuana is a dangerous drug that can have acute and hazardous effects."  Over 10,500 published scientific papers show that marijuana damages brain cells, the lungs, may adversely affect reproduction in women and fertility in men, endangers the unborn baby and newborns of pot-smoking women, and could damage the heart.
<P>
Shalala calls for "strong and comprehensive solutions....Young people must grow up knowing unambiguously that drug use -- including smoking marijuana -- is unwise, unhealthful, illegal and wrong.  They must hear this from everyone in their communities -- their parents, their teachers, their employers, their peers, the media -- all of us.  We need anti-drug messages that are every bit as pervasive and strong as the pop culture images that tell our youth drugs are o.k."
<P>
These strong words are not echoed by other Administration officials.  President Clinton has been virtually silent on the topic.  And his national drug strategy focuses on a new philosophy entitled "harm reduction," which provides and supports programs to reduce the danger of drug use-related risks, like HIV infection.  Needle exchange is a key component.  The strategy is geared at changing but not eliminating drug-using behavior, in order to reduce the threat of disease due to drug use.
<P>
Meanwhile, the Administration has cut drug interdiction efforts and increased efforts to treat chronic abusers.  The hope is that having more abusers in treatment will reduce demand -- a step toward ending the plague.
<P>
Unfortunately, the pop culture glamorizes drugs, and there are few alternative cultural icons warning teenagers to "just say no."  Additionally, there is no sign that drug production and distribution are declining.  In fact, there continues to be an ample supply.
<P>
The 104th Congress may cut school-based drug prevention programs believing they don't work.  There are some ineffective programs, but others have good track records and should be kept.  
<P>
The House rescissions bill (H.R. 1158) cut most of the FY 95 drug prevention money.  Pending legislation in the Senate may recover some of the funds.   
<P>
The national drug crisis requires committed parents and community leaders to join forces.  At the national level, leadership such as that provided by President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan is needed to curb the drug glamorization messages and boost effective prevention programs.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Free Public Broadcasting</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The Corporation for Public Broadcasting was created in 1967 during Lyndon Johnson's "Great Society" to meet a perceived need for taxpayer-financed alternative programming not provided by commercial networks.  Congressional authorization for CPB is due to expire at the end of 1996.  The 104th Congress should let authorization expire and decline to appropriate any more taxpayer money for CPB.  Instead of giving more taxpayer support to CPB, Congress should let it thrive on its own, as it has shown it can do.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The House budget resolution (H. Con. Res. 67) sponsored by Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio) takes the first steps by providing a three-year phase out of funding for CPB.  The resolution passed the House on May 18 by a vote of 238 to 193.  A weaker Senate budget resolution (S. Con. Res. 13) was passed on May 25 by a vote of 57 to 42.  It includes a provision sponsored by Sen. Hank Brown (R-Col.) to bring commercial sponsors to CPB in order to offset possible reductions in taxpayer subsidies.  The Senate resolution includes no explicit cuts in funding and falls short of the goal of privatization.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Budget resolutions in both houses of Congress provide a starting point for privatizing CPB, but more action is needed.  Budget resolutions are only suggestions for how to spend taxpayers' money.  Bills dealing with the appropriation of CPB funds will be making their way through the Congress this summer.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The CPB should be privatized for several reasons.  First, the federal government should not be in the broadcasting business.  The basis for CPB's existence is the assumption that for good television programming to exist, the government must provide it.  This $285.6 million a year, anti-free market philosophy insults the intelligence of the viewing/listening public because it assumes that they won't support good programming.
<P>
Second, CPB has been a regular launching pad for attacks on the family.  Independent Television Service's Television Families, Dottie Gets Spanked, and Terminal USA ridicule traditional families and glorify non-traditional households.  A PBS documentary What Kids Want to Know About Sex and Growing Up contains graphic sexual information, aimed at children as young as 8 years old.  The role of parents in the education of their children as well as the moral and familial ramifications of sexuality are almost invisible.  PBS's Tales of the City and Tongues Untied are offensive and graphic promotions of the homosexual lifestyle.  Both programs contain gratuitous nudity, lewdness and foul language.  Religious bigotry is also common in CPB programming. National Public Radio's The Politics of Bigotry was billed as an "in-depth investigation of the Christian Right."  It was actually an ugly smear of Christians which violated the First Amendment's guarantee of free exercise of religion.
<P>
Finally, in a time of massive federal deficits, it makes no sense to require taxpayers to shell out their hard-earned dollars so that the government can run a television network that could survive on its own anyway.  As any family knows, serious budget cutting must start with non-essentials. 
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Defunding CPB is a priority for conservatives.  But these efforts are being met with stiff opposition from CPB supporters in both parties who argue that opponents are trying to kill "Big Bird."  It is hoped that the merits of privatization will drown out such scare tactics.

<P>
<CENTER><H3> Free the Arts and Humanities: Defund the NEA and NEH</H3></CENTER>
<P>

<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Over the years, a total of more than $5 billion in taxpayer money has gone toward the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.  These federal agencies disburse millions of dollars each year in grants to institutions and individuals, most of which are not controversial.  But continued revelations of wasteful spending, public sponsorship of blatantly anti-family, anti-Christian, anti-business, pro-feminist and pro-homosexual "scholarly" projects and "art works" may finally motivate Congress to defund the endowments. 
  <P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The House Budget Resolution (H. Con.Res. 67), which passed 238 to 193 on May 18, provides no funds to either of the endowments.  A separate reauthorization bill, however, sponsored by Rep. Bill Goodling (R-Penn.), passed the Education and Economic Opportunities Committee on May 10.  That bill would phase out NEA and NEH by 1999 and is awaiting floor action.  In the Senate, the budget resolution sponsored by Sen. Pete Domenici (R-Ariz.) would cut the endowments but not phase them out.  Senators Jeffords, Kassebaum, Kennedy, et al. have introduced S. 856, the Arts, Humanities, and Museum Services Act of 1995.  This bill would reauthorize both endowments.  Introduced on May 25, it was referred to the Labor and Human Resources Committee.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Most legislation on the NEA and NEH seeks to trim funding.  But merely reducing the budgets for the endowments would be breaking faith with American voters who want government to cut back on non-essentials now.  And leaving the endowments bleeding but still very much alive guarantees several years of shrill politicking by subsidy-seeking arts and campus groups.  It also ensures an easier renewal of spending if Congress falls back into 
liberal hands.
<P>
The NEA is budgeted $162.5 million in fiscal 1995 (down $4.5 million from $167 million because of an earlier rescission bill).  NEH is budgeted $172 million (also trimmed by $5 million from $177 million).  The House bill would also place a 5 percent cap on administrative expenses, thus gutting the Washington operations of the endowments, and send 80 percent of the grant money to the state arts councils in block grants.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  An attempt to zero out funds for NEA and NEH failed in the House Education and Economic Opportunities Committee, which settled for the phase-out.  But the House Budget Resolution calls for no funding.  House negotiators will have to choose whether to do the right thing (zero out the agencies) or succumb to pressure from liberal colleagues and the more liberal Senate to retain the agencies in some fashion.  The latter course will earn budget cutters no love from the arts and humanities crowd, and will only ensure more conflict in the years ahead.   
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Religious Rights Restored</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Although the First Amendment to the United States Constitution includes the right to freely exercise religion, the ultra-broad interpretation of the provision prohibiting government from establishing a religion has nearly nullified the free exercise right.  A restorative amendment is needed to return to citizens their full First Amendment rights.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) is heading a coalition of congressmen and pro-family groups in drafting an amendment to the U.S. Constitution which would restore to individuals and groups the right to speak and express their religious beliefs.  Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) and Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.) may cosponsor the amendment.  
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  The amendment has not yet been introduced.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Before any proposed language is introduced, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution will hold hearings around the country on the topic of  "Religious Liberties and the Bill of Rights."  The first hearing was scheduled to take place in Washington, DC on June 8, 1995, followed by hearings in Harrisonburg, Va., Oklahoma City, Los Angeles, Tampa Bay, New York City, and Philadelphia.
  <P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The starting point for this legislation was H. J. Res. 424, introduced October 7, 1993, which contained the language discussed in the Senate during the Reagan Administration.  The premises upon which this effort is based include the following:  that a constitutional amendment approach is necessary due to existing court decisions on constitutional grounds; that participation in prayer should not be compelled; and that neither a moment of silence nor government-mandated language is acceptable.  While the language of the amendment is not yet final, it is expected to include provisions preventing the government from prohibiting prayer or other religious expression where non-religious expression is permitted, and from discriminating against or denying benefits to groups on account of their religious identity or ideas.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  This amendment will see heavy opposition from the ACLU and like-minded groups.  It is unclear whether the "super-majority" (two-thirds) needed for the amendment to pass is possible. 
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Parental Rights Restored</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Increasingly, parents' efforts to teach their children morals, values, and discipline are frustrated by government bureaucrats who claim a superior role in the development of the child.  A law is needed to restore to parents the right to direct the upbringing of their minor children without governmental interference.

<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) and Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) are each drafting legislation to prohibit the government from interfering with the right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children. 
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  The bills have not yet been introduced.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:   Both bills are on hold while the Family Research Council and other pro-family groups hammer out appropriate language.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The Parental Rights Act is designed primarily as a response to parents' inability to control important aspects of their children's education.  The Act would, for example, support parents who want to opt their children out of offensive sex education programs.   However, the Act not only protects parents' rights vis a vis education, but also prohibits government interference with regard to medical decisions for their children, reasonable corporal punishment of their children, and the direction of, or provision for, religious teaching for their children.   Some pro-life groups have some concern that the medical decision provision of the Act would prohibit governmental intervention in cases where parents attempt to coerce a daughter into having an abortion.  Similarly, there is currently some doubt as to whether the Act would indeed provide a counterbalance to privacy arguments against parental consent statutes, as it was originally envisioned.  The concept of statutorily restoring parents' rights is a good one, and, once the wording issues have been resolved, the Act will need support from pro-family citizens.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:	The bills will likely be introduced and debated this term.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Defund Anti-Family Legal Activism</H3></CENTER>

<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The Legal Services Corporation is a federally-funded program created in 1974 to provide poor people with access to expensive legal services.  In actuality, LSC serves as a deep well for anti-family litigation.  Each year hundreds of millions of dollars in legal services are donated to the poor from the private sector.  This $415 million a year pot of gold for the anti-family movement is not needed and should be abolished.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  There is no pending legislation dealing narrowly with Legal Services Corporation, but the House and Senate budget resolutions each call for rolling back LSC funding.  Thus, legislation which at least reduces funding of LSC is likely to come out of the Senate and House Appropriations Committees later this year.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Although there is no current legislation on LSC, pro-family groups, including FRC, are working on strategies for abolishing it.  These efforts include a letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole calling for the defunding of LSC.  In mid-May, Sen. Phil Gramm's Appropriations Subcommittee on Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies held hearings on LSC.  Sen. Gramm pledged to fight the appropriation of money for LSC in the upcoming appropriations bill.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The Legal Services Corporation has operated for 15 years without Congressional authorization.  Yet it continues to be one of the most powerful weapons in the anti-family arsenal.  LSC has played a major role in expanding abortion, divorce and the homosexual agenda.  It has spent $5 billion since 1974 on outrageous litigation ranging from providing cable TV for prisoners to forcing states to fund sex-change operations.  LSC has been a major combatant against welfare reform.  Supporters of LSC claim that it balances the scales in a system where poor people are at a disadvantage because of the high cost of legal services.  But state and local governments as well as bar associations and individual lawyers already provide a great deal of legal aid to the poor.  Instead of helping poor people, LSC often joins the efforts of well-funded anti-family groups such as the ACLU and the National Organization for Women.  Moreover, LSC lacks oversight.  According to Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) oversight has dropped significantly during the Clinton Administration.  Two years ago over 150 on-site audits took place, compared with fewer than 10 this past year.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The battle to defund the Legal Services Corporation will be a hard one.  Like many expensive government programs, LSC has appeal because it appears to help people in need.  Supporters will try to play to the public's sympathy for the poor, portraying those who want to cut the program as cruel.  But LSC's 21-year track record of radical anti-family activism will be brought to light during the debate.  Also, the deficit-conscious 104th Congress is more
likely to take a serious look at whether such programs are really necessary.

   <H1>How to Beat the Supreme Court on School Prayer</H1>
   <H3>By Harry V. Jaffa</H3>

</center>

"We are a religious people, whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being."

<p>
There is no better way to confirm the truth of the foregoing aphorism of the late Justice William O. Douglas, 
than to take a tour through the state constitutions.  Forty-seven of the fifty states have preambles invoking the 
name of Almighty God.  A joint resolution of the Congress could declare that children in public schools might 
lawfully recite voluntary prayers employing only such acknowledgment of divine power and goodness as is 
present in their own state constitution, or in the constitutions of any of the other states.  When this resolution is 
signed by the President--and it is difficult to imagine any reason to object to it--it could take effect 
immediately.  It is also difficult to imagine that the Supreme Court could take exception to such a resolution.  
To do so would not only put it in direct opposition to the elected branches of government, but also would 
require it, in effect, to declare the state constitutions unconstitutional!


<p>
Consider the perfectly nonsectarian piety embodied in the fundamental laws of the states:

<blockquote><i>We the people of Alabama, in order to establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, and to secure the blessing 
of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, invoking the favor and guidance of Almighty God, do ordain and 
establish the following Constitution and form of government . . .</i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>We the people of the State of California, grateful to Almighty God for our freedom, in order to secure and 
perpetuate its blessings, do establish this Constitution.</i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>The people of Connecticut, acknowledging with gratitude the good providence of God, in having permitted them 
to enjoy a free government . . .</i>
</blockquote>


<p>
This selection should be sufficient to illustrate the consistency in the patterns of all the preambles. Who could 
ask more in a school prayer than to acknowledge that it is through Divine Providence that we enjoy our civil 
and religious liberty, and that we reaffirm our faith in and constant reliance upon God to preserve and 
perpetuate it?


<p>
It is notable that the state constitutions have provisions equivalent to the "no establishment" and "free exercise" clauses of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.  One example that will suffice for present 
purposes is that of California:

<blockquote>
<i>Free exercise and enjoyment of religion without discrimination or preference are guaranteed.  This liberty of conscience does not
excuse acts that are licentious or inconsistent with the peace and safety of the State.  The legislature shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
From this it is apparent that the people of the states have seen no inconsistency between the guarantees of 
religious freedom in their constitutions, and the expressions of gratitude to God for the enjoyment of that 
freedom in the same constitutions.

<p>
American constitutions whether federal or state, rest ultimately upon the theology of the Declaration of 
Independence.  This fact has been obscured by the domination of a legal positivism which is simply unable to 
understand the relationship between natural and divine law on the one hand, and human law on the other.  Yet 
this relationship was axiomatic for our Founding Fathers.  If however we ask why we have an obligation--that 
is to say, a moral duty--to obey the laws, either of our State, or of the United States, there is only one answer.  
It is because those laws exist "to secure these rights," rights with which we have been "endowed by [our] 
Creator."  Constitutional governments have no other purpose but to render valuable rights whose origin is 
altogether independent of human will, rights which are unalienable because they are fixed eternally in "the laws 
of nature and of nature's God."  Through the ages many governments which did not respect the rights of the 
individual have claimed to be based upon the consent of the governed.  But the consent of the governed 
required by our republican constitutions is derived from the equal and unalienable rights of each human person.


<p>
Legal positivists deny to the Declaration any role in constitutional interpretation.  However, according to the 
United States Code, adopted by the Congress, it is the first of the Organic Laws of the United States.  That this 
is not merely formal or ceremonial is shown by the fact that every enabling act by the Congress for the 
admission of a State to the Union since the Civil War has had the following provision.  


<p>
<blockquote>
<i>The Constitution of the State of ______ shall always be republican in form and shall not be repugnant to the 
Constitution of the United States and the principles of the Declaration of Independence.</i>
</blockquote>


<p>
It can be seen that the rights secured to us by the human law, whether of the states or of the United States, are 
means of implementing antecedent rights whose origin is in a Supreme Being.  It is difficult to imagine how we 
can teach citizenship to future citizens, without inculcating in them an understanding of and a reverence for this 
origin.

</CENTER>

<p>

Bruce Herschensohn has been a television and radio political commentator 
for the last two decades.  After service in the U.S. Air Force he began his own motion picture 
company and then was appointed Director of Motion Pictures and TV for the United States 
Information Agency.  During his tenure the USIA received more awards for films and television 
productions than all other departments and agencies of the U.S. Government combined, 
including the Oscar from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences.  

<p>

In 1969 he was selected as one of the Ten Outstanding Young Men in the Federal Government.  He received the second highest civilian award, the Distinguished Service Medal, and then became Deputy 
Special Assistant to President Nixon.  His travels to over ninety countries gave him unique 
insight of world-wide political affairs.

<p>

Herschensohn taught "The U.S. Image Abroad" at the University of Maryland, and occupied the Nixon Chair at Whittier College teaching "U.S. Foreign and Domestic Policy."  He was Chairman of the Board of Pepperdine University, and was appointed a member of the Reagan Transition Team.  He was the 1992 Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in California and was defeated while winning over one million votes more 
than the national ticket of the Party. 

<p>

He is now a Claremont Institute Distinguished Fellow, and the author of numerous articles on politics and public policy, and the recently released book, <i>Lost Trumpets</i> (Claremont Institute Press, 1994).

   <H1>Restoring  Conservative  Unity</H1>
   <H3>By Larry P. Arnn</H3>

</center>

The radical change of the 1994 election was produced by a unity of conservatives as strong as in the days of Reagan.  All the elements of the Reagan coalition functioned together magnificently in the congressional races and a forty-year lock on the Congress was broken.  Economic and social conservatives stood arm in arm.

<p>
Now, that harmony strains and threatens to break.  Last week, a long report on the <i>McNeil-Lehrer News Hour</i> presented a parade of conservatives chastising one another and threatening to break ranks.  Social conservatives threaten to walk away from the coalition if the moral agenda is not given priority.  Economic conservatives claim that religious zealots are attempting to control politics in the name of a faith they do not share.  Of course, the liberal journalist reported all of this with delight.

<p>
The correspondent for <i>McNeil-Lehrer</i> drew the obvious conclusion:  If this division deepens, the chances of the new majority will be ended.  Real reform requires an enduring majority, a majority broadly-based and stable over time. 	

<p>
The warning signs are then apparent, and we can avoid the danger they portend only if we recover the foundation upon which all stable majorities in America must stand.  That foundation lies among the simple truths that were the basis of our country at the beginning.  When our nation stood upon that foundation, no one divided the "economic" from the "social"  issues, and no one fought about the difference between them.

<p>
These simple truths are the central principles of our country.  They address themselves to our status as human beings and citizens, and cover all of our rights and all of our duties. Conservatives should understand that these principles apply just as much and in the same way to the economic as to the social issues, and just as much to the protection of the family as to the defense of private property.  

<p>
These truths receive their finest expression in the Declaration of Independence, where they are described as certain "self evident truths."  They stem from something called "the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God."  What are these truths, and what are these laws?  They have a lot to do with common sense.  They tell us that we are free and equal citizens.  They tell us that we are on the one hand entitled to our liberty and on the other responsible for our own actions.

<p>
First of all, these principles provide the strongest foundation in history for what we now call "economic liberty."  The authors of the Declaration and of the Constitution assert this belief with simple eloquence.  Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1812 that "To take from one, because it is thought his own industry and that of his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare to others, who...have not, exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association, the guarantee to everyone the free exercise of his industry and the fruits acquired by it."  In the <i>Federalist</i>, James Madison writes that the "chief object of government" is to "protect the different and unequal faculties of acquiring property."

<p>
The right to property is then a sacred right, no less firmly established than the right to speak one's mind or worship God in one's own time and way.  The right to property gives a vital assurance that these other rights can be secured.

<p>
What do these principles say about the importance of moral behavior?  Consider the Virginia Bill of Rights and its assertion "That no free government, or the blessings of liberty, can be preserved to any people, but by a firm adherence to justice, moderation, temperance, frugality, and virtue, and by frequent recurrence to fundamental principles."  

<p>
A conservative movement built upon these ideas would then encourage moral behavior.  It would reform the welfare system for example, because it encourages young women to conceive children out of wedlock.  It would not tax more heavily those who are married than those who are not.  It should support the authority and responsibility of parents over children and the obligations of husband and wife.

<p>
A conservative movement united upon the ideas of the founding would also encourage religion.  George Washington affirmed the importance of religion during his farewell address when he said that "Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports...reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle."  

<p>
A conservative policy on religion would respect the freedom to practice any religion that encourages good citizenship.  It would not supplant the role of religious and other charities in social welfare.  It would encourage prayer in school and upon public occasions.

<p>
A conservative movement united under these policies would act under the principles of our founding.  It would adhere to the Constitution and those higher laws, the laws of nature and of nature's God, upon which that Constitution stands.  

<p>
Such a conservative unity can lead America from its troubles.  Such a unity can be built only by a people who know as well as Jefferson the meaning of their country, and who fight as bravely as Washington for its principles.

FRC's staff of public policy experts -- and extramural family experts recommended by FRC -- are frequently called to testify before Congressional committees debating pending legislation or seeking guidance on vital family issues.  FRC also routinely submits unsolicited testimony to House and Senate Committees open to informed public opinion.  Topics range from the mundane and technical to the speculative and controversial.  Congressional testimony represents one of FRC's prime educational functions as a nonprofit organization located in the nation's capital.

   <H1>Transferring the USIA to the Department of Many Umbrellas</H1>
   <H3>By Bruce Herschensohn</H3>

</center>


<p>
The dismemberment of the Soviet Union has brought many in Congress to the conclusion that the United States can close or cut those foreign policy entities that took a lead role in the Cold War.  As a result, the United States Information Agency (USIA) may soon be slated for takeover by the U. S. State Department, with a commensurate and severe cut in the funds of USIA's radio arm, the Voice of America (VOA).  The VOA could then be virtually destroyed by the Chamerlainesque policies of State.  The hallways of the State Department are lined with dripping umbrellas, even when it isn't raining outside.

<p>
Is the USIA and its VOA still valuable with the Soviet Union gone?  Of course it is.  The death of the Soviet Union does not guarantee that democracy is the one and only outlook for Russia and other former Soviet Republics.  Nor does it mean that totalitarians around the world will applaud U.S. policy.  The VOA is the SDI of information.  Its stories about the United States have balanced the movies, rap songs, and gang activities which many citizens of the world would otherwise think consume this nation.  Its truth-telling of world news and events has encouraged the citizens of the world to accept nothing less than liberty.

<p>
On the sixth anniversary of the Tiananman Square massacre, the VOA's transmitters reached tens of millions of people in China despite their government's attempts at jamming it.  Would our State Department be so insistent?

<p>
When the Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Ms. Saw Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, was released from house arrest this month, she told reporters that during those six years of confinement the VOA was her outside line to the free world.  Everyday at 6:00 PM she stopped everything to listen to its broadcasts.

<p>
The National Spiritual Assembly of Bahai's of the United States officially expressed its appreciation to the VOA for keeping the Teheran regime of Iran aware of America's commitment to the cause of the Bahai's human rights.

<p>
The representative of the Dalai Lama recently contrasted the truth of the VOA to the propaganda from the People's Republic of China media to Tibet.  He wrote, "The Voice of America's Tibetan Language News Service is the only independent source of news for the Tibetan speaking areas of the world."

<p>
What would our State Department say to Cuba, Burma, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Vietnam, Serbia, and Libya as it directs the Voice of America?  What would it say to Tibet?

<p>
There are areas of the USIA that I believe can be eliminated without risk.  The Fulbright scholarship programs should not be part of the workings of the federal government and the exchange programs should be served by private institutions.  But the USIA's libraries in 130 countries, its publications, its films and television programs and, of course, the Voice of America, are invaluable allies of those who want to know what the United States is all about, and what liberty is all about, and what truth is all about.

<p>
The 104th Congress is magnificently doing what has not been done since the birth of our nation. Its members, like our Founders, are acting against political nature by giving power to the states, the localities, and the people.  James Madison wrote that the federal government's duties "will be exercised principally on external objects," meaning foreign affairs.  The power now being surrendered by our federal government in foreign affairs will, of course, not revert to the states, the localities, and the people, as it will in domestic affairs.  

<p>
If the USIA is stripped of its influence, that power will not go to the people of California, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, and Delaware.  It will go to Kim Jong Il, Mu'ammar el-Qaddafi, Fidel Castro, Hafez al-Assad, and Deng Xiaoping.

   <H1>Fatherlessness</H1>
   <h2>The Central Social Problem of Our Time</h2>
   <H3>By Tom Lowe</H3>

</center>

<p>
For most of our history, a child growing up in the United States of  America could reasonably expect to grow up with a 
father at home.  Today, he can reasonably expect not to.  Fatherlessness is fast replacing fatherhood.  Never in our nation's 
history have so many men decided to abandon their children.  And never have the effects of that abandonment been felt so 
ubiquitously.


<p>
Divorce; child poverty; youth violence; the failure of education; unsafe neighborhoods; domestic violence; the weakening of 
parental authority--all are most directly attributable to the scourge of fatherlessness.  In his incisive new book <i>Fatherless 
America</i>, David Blankenhorn points out that, "Tonight, about 40 percent of American children will go to sleep in homes in 
which their fathers do not live . . . Fatherlessness," says Blankenhorn, "is the engine driving our most urgent social 
problems."


<p>
Our ancestral understanding of fatherhood, which in many ways was responsible for early American success and survival, is 
under siege.  Men in general, but fathers in particular, are viewed as superfluous--America is now unable to believe in 
fatherhood as an inherent domain of males that absolutely effects the well-being of children and society.  

<p>
A blizzard of statistics and studies confirms the relationship between fatherlessness and child poverty.  In married-couple 
homes as of 1992, 13 percent of all children under the age of six lived in poverty, while in single-mother homes an 
unbearably sad 66 percent of young children lived in poverty.  And consider that in married-couple homes with pre-school 
children, median family income in 1992 was approximately $41,000, while in single mother homes, median income was 
about $9,000.  America cannot address its child poverty problem without first addressing its most powerful determinant--fatherlessness. 


<p>
After protection and provisional responsibility, the central task of fatherhood is cultural conveyance.  As described in the 
Book of Genesis, paternity does not just mean males providing food and shelter for children, it also means that they ensure 
that the child grows up to be a <i>certain type of person</i>.  Biological paternity means producing a child--fatherhood means 
producing an adult.  For boys, the most insidious manifestation of fatherlessness has been juvenile violence, and for girls it 
has been out of wedlock childbearing.  


<p>
Studies show that girls who grow up without fathers are at much greater risk for early sexual activity, adolescent 
childbearing, and divorce.  Among white families, one study finds that "daughters of single parents are 111 percent more 
likely to have children as teenagers, and 164 percent more likely to have a pre-marital birth."


<p>
These studies also confirm that boys who grow up without a father at home are three times as likely to get in trouble with the 
police.  Historian James Q. Wilson reminds us that, "Neighborhood standards may be set by mothers, but they are enforced 
by fathers, or at least by adult males.  Neighborhoods without fathers are neighborhoods without men able and willing to 
confront errant youth, chase threatening gangs. . . The absence of fathers. . . deprives the community of those little platoons 
that informally but often effectively control boys on the street."


<p>
Frighteningly, an entire generation of young people is now growing up in neighborhoods substantially devoid of fathers or 
responsible males.  As of 1994, the illegitimacy rate among blacks was 68 percent, and in certain welfare-infested inner city 
neighborhoods over 80 percent of children are growing up in fatherless homes.  <i>Over 80 Percent.</i>


<p>
The federal welfare system is partly to blame.  Welfare cash payments to out-of-work mothers usurp a man's traditional role 
as provider; they make the struggling male breadwinner unnecessary, emasculating him.  His response is predictable.  He 
turns to the super-masculine world of the streets:  drinking, drugs, male camaraderie and crime.  The dissolution of the ties 
that bind men to their children explains much of the rampant pathology from the city streets to small towns across America.


<p>
What is the solution to fatherlessness?  Laws strengthening the traditional family are part of the answer.  There should be 
firm public endorsement of healthy families, especially in textbooks written for schools.  Divorce should be made more 
difficult.  So-called alternative life-styles should be treated with the contempt they deserve for damaging our childrens well-
being.  State legislatures could reaffirm the value of two-parent families by passing laws to prohibit sperm banks from 
selling sperm to unmarried women.  The tax codes, which are unfriendly, if not downright hostile to families, must be 
changed to promote two-parent families and the raising of children at home.


<p>
As Blankenhorn insists, the most urgent social challenge for America as it heads into the twenty-first century is the re-
creation of fatherhood as a vital social role for males.  Does every child deserve a father?  The current answer in American 
society is "no" or "not necessarily."  The only answer that can save our children's future is an unabashed yes, but today, few 
ideas could be more radical.

   <H1>What Welfare Should Be</H1>
   <H3>By Larry P. Arnn & Thomas G. West </H3>

</center>

What should welfare be twenty-five years from now?  The current system and everything like it should be a faint memory.  In its place should be a system that is local in administration.  This new system must support family and work.  It must respect marriage, disdain illegitimacy, and distinguish the deserving poor from the pretenders.  It must rely in large part upon the initiative of private parties and 
organizations, in other words it must be again a system of charity and not of interest-group driven public policy.  It must be fair and good.

<p>
During the 1960's, 70's, and 80's the public debate over welfare consisted mostly of money talk.  Can we afford welfare?  Who should have to pay for it?  Much, however, has changed over the past decade. Now, thanks to the accumulation of bad experience, and the clear heads of a wise few, we are reaching to the fundamentals.  We see now that a vast treasure of ill targeted relief has bought us only more misery.  We see that the poor have been hurt even more than the tax payer has been bilked.

<p>
Between 1960 and 1990 government welfare spending increased from about $30 billion (measured in 1990 dollars) to $225 billion per year; an increase of 750 percent.  The reasons for this dependency are many and complicated, but consider that in 1992, for example, a welfare mother of two living in California with a Section 8 housing voucher from the federal Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, had a tax-free equivalent income of $1,817 per month, or $21,804 per year.  This is more than twice the after-tax amount she could have earned at a full-time minimum-wage job.  Why should she work when welfare prices work out of the market?

<p>
The percentage of poor Americans has not been reduced since modern welfare began in the mid-1960s.  On the contrary, these programs have in truth worked against economic growth and opportunity for the poor.  Before the big 1960s increases in welfare spending, the poverty level had actually been <i>declining</i> rapidly.  According to government figures, 35 percent of Americans were poor in 1950.  By 1965, that figure had declined to 14 percent, which is about where it has stubbornly remained ever since.

<p>
The stubborn immobility of the poverty numbers is bad enough, but it is not the worst.  The nature of poverty has changed insidiously.  Prior to the 1960s, most poor Americans were poor because their work brought them a paltry income.  But since the middle of the 60s there has been a sharp and ominous increase of social pathology in urban, welfare-infested communities.  Poverty has increasingly become a problem stemming from a new underclass of able-bodied people who work rarely or not at all.  Many of them, especially males, reject the qualities that most Americans admire:  self-control, sobriety, duty to family, loyalty, courage, fair play, and faith in God.

<p>
The new underclass, mired in government dependency, rejects the ethic of hard work and self-reliance.  Low-paying jobs--where many Americans have traditionally learned the basic skills of showing up on time and getting the job done--are scoffed at.  The underclass regards these jobs as "dead-end" and their pay as "chump change."  For this urban underclass, many of whom have spent care-free years not working, hanging around smoking reefer and drinking 40-ounce beers, the reality of trying to hold down a regular job is too much.  In this world, the drug dealing thug is lionized and the man who sweeps floors is scorned.  Welfare has taught our poor all the wrong lessons.

<p>
If today's welfare policies are not working, what then is the alternative?  Prior to the new, post-1965 approach, America had the most successful poverty program in history.  Two centuries ago, at least 90 percent of Americans were desperately poor by today's standards.  By the 1960s a majority of Americans had moved into the middle class.  The recipe for America's successful 189-year-long poverty program was simple: 
<ol>
<li>Establish free markets and opportunity for all who can work.
<li>Provide strong governmental support for the traditional family and for a morality of self-control, industriousness, and basic decency.
<li>Provide individual support in local communities for the deserving poor (orphans, the elderly, and the disabled), and temporarily for the wayward able who desire to pull themselves out from poverty.
</ol>


<p>
Let us assume that the federal government is acting on the new prevailing intellectual consensus about poverty programs by handing over to states and local governments the authority to set and administer their own assistance programs for the poor.  With that in mind, here are characteristics of programs and ideas that can help in the transition away from the disastrous federal welfare state.

<p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Political and community leaders should again talk candidly about virtue, vice and shame.</i></b></ul>

<p>
We know destructive and immoral conduct when we see it.  Its carnage is all around us and there is no reason to refrain from pointing out the truth.  One of the most frustrating problems in trying to resolve the current poverty question, as <i>Newsweek</i> pointed out in a cover story last fall, is the fact  that "shame" has all but disappeared from American society.  Thirty years ago, it was considered shameful to be on the government dole.  But beginning in the 60s, as Marvin Olasky points out in <i>The Tragedy of American Compassion</i>, the poor were taught by welfare organizers that welfare is "nothing to be ashamed of."  Before that, he says, poor mothers had  "a sense that welfare should be avoided."  But, "the constant repetition of <i>rights</i> got through."  The result was "a changing outlook among many poor and the near poor."  The deceptive notion that there was "dignity" in accepting government aid was widely promulgated in these years.  Accordingly, within a few years a much larger proportion of those eligible for welfare chose to take advantage of it.  

<p>
When the stigma of accepting hand-outs is lost, so then is much of the self-reliant spirit it takes for people to pull themselves out of poverty.  Society must not be afraid to cast shame upon laziness, and leaders must affirm with renewed vigilance the duties and responsibilities of citizenship:  hard work, honesty, duty to family and self-sufficiency.

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>Understand that fatherlessness is the central social problem of our time.</i></b></ul>

<p>
It is in fact the key to solving poverty and crime problems.  While we know children do better with a father at home, and while it is damaging for a child to grow up without one, an almost incomprehensible disaster happens when an entire generation of young people grows up in neighborhoods substantially devoid of fathers or responsible males.  As of  1994, the illegitimacy rate among blacks was 68 percent, but in certain welfare-infested inner city neighborhoods 80 percent of children are growing up in fatherless homes.

<p>
The problem, however, has spread far beyond the inner city.  In his incisive new book <i>Fatherless America</i>, David Blankenhorn points out that, "Tonight, about 40 percent of American children will go to sleep in homes in which their fathers do not live. . . . Fatherlessness," says Blankenhorn, "is the engine driving our most urgent social problems, from crime to adolescent pregnancy. . . . A blizzard of statistics and studies confirms the relationship between fatherlessness and child poverty."  These studies indicate that in married-couple homes as of  1992, 13 percent of all children under the age of six lived in poverty; while in single-mother homes a deplorable 66 percent of children lived in poverty.  

<p>
The federal welfare system is partly to blame.  Welfare cash payments usurp a man's traditional role as provider; they make the struggling male breadwinner superfluous, emasculating him.  His response is predictable.  He turns to the masculine world of the streets:  drinking, gang banging, drugs, male camaraderie and crime.  The dissolution of the ties that bind men to their children explains much of today's rampant pathology.

<p>
Cash payments to underage girls who decide to have children without bothering to get married put the government in the indefensible position of encouraging reckless sexual behavior and illegitimate births.  Laws supporting family integrity need strengthening.  There should be firm public endorsement of healthy families, consisting of a married father and mother raising their own offspring.  Divorce should be made more difficult; and so-called alternative life-styles should be treated with the contempt they deserve for damaging our children's well-being.

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>A serious response to the crime that plagues poor neighborhoods is required forthwith.</i></b></ul>

<p>
In the urban quagmire most poor now find themselves trapped in, there is a clear and present need for an efficient system of arrest, prosecution, trial (not plea bargains), rigorous adherence to stiff sentencing, a crackdown on youth violence, and imprisonment for the first violent offense.

<p>
The most pressing purpose of government is to protect life, liberty, and property.  That purpose is subverted daily and pervasively in every major city in America, where flagrant piracy is a way of life.  The law-abiding poor need protection more urgently than the law-abiding middle class, who always have the option of moving to a safer neighborhood.

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>The failure of public schools must be acknowledged and repaired.</i></b></ul>  

<p>
In the immediate term, tax credits or vouchers for school expenses would instantly enable the poor to send their children to private schools, something that is an affordable option today only for the middle class and the wealthy.  In the longer term, public schools need radical overhaul.  Control over schools should be returned to local communities, and large numbers of administrative positions should be canceled.

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>Private charity must be supported and not supplanted by the government welfare system.</i></b></ul>

<p>
In the current "division of labor" in welfare, private charities provide few "on-line services," which means giving direct help to the needy.  That job is done by government.  Private action is forced to the sidelines, where it spends its time conducting experiments, running model programs, and giving expert advice to the government.  Private charity must be liberated so that it can flourish in America as it once did. We should invest private groups with the responsibility to do the main work in assisting the poor.  

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>Separate the deserving poor from the lazy at the local level--make welfare less generous and 
more burdensome.</i></b></ul>

<p>
In <i>The Tragedy of American Compassion</i>, Olasky describes how local assistance programs in the nineteenth century separated the "idle" from the "truly needy" by using "work tests" to discern the character of those seeking assistance.  Charities and shelters had "wood-yards" attached to their property.  "Transients willing to chop were given two meals and a nights lodging."  Not surprisingly, a commentator in 1894 noted that, "when the managers of a Boston charity attached a wood-yard and announced that relief would be given to no able-bodied man, unless willing to do a certain amount of work, the daily number of applicants fell off at once from one hundred and sixty to forty-nine."  Today, and in the future, of course, the wood-yard would be some variance on "workfare," but the idea remains the same:  To provide basic sustenance consistent with the apostle Paul's common-sense injunction, that able-bodied men who do not work are not entitled to eat.

<p>
The first steps in replacing the welfare mess should focus on turning assistance into a temporary safety-net instead of the entrapping spider web it is today.  For instance, people in dire need whose families cannot help them should have to live in local communal arrangements, with requirements for long hours of work, and  with strict rules of behavior (no overnight guests for the unmarried).  Getting tough on dependency is the only solution.  Benjamin Franklin said of welfare, "I am for doing good to the poor, but I differ in opinion of the means.  I think the best way of doing good to the poor, is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it." 

<p>
America needs to discover again, as we once knew well, that true compassion calls for treating the able-bodied poor as adults with souls rather than as mindless children who will never grow up.

Adopted Children Fare Better than Children in Single Parent 
Households</a><br>
An Article By Gracie S. Hsu

<p>

Since joining the Family Research Council in September 1993, Gracie 
Hsu's research skills -- honed at the Johns Hopkins University -- 
have served as an asset to the work of the pro-family advocacy group's 
policy department.  In her current position as policy analyst, she is 
responsible for managing the Family Research Council's efforts in the 
fields of adolescent sexuality and life issues.  As part of FRC's 
outreach to the academic, media and legislative arenas, Miss Hsu's 
work consists of tracking, analyzing, and writing critical essays on 
new research, policy trends, and legislative initiatives concerning 
teen sexuality and abortion issues. She also represents FRC, 
explaining pro-family policy to audiences from capitol hill to the 
<i>CBS Evening News</i>. Her craftsmanship with the written word is 
a special skill she brings to FRC. As an op-ed writer, Miss Hsu 
(pronounced "Shoe") has been published in the <I>San Diego Union 
Tribune, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Orange County Register</I>, and 
other leading publications.

<p>

Miss Hsu began her work at the Family Research Council as a research 
assistant for health policy issues during the crucial first phases of 
health care reform.  Her project opposing abortion in health care 
reform contributed to U.S. Senate hearings on the subject. Prior to 
joining the Family Research Council, her research experience included 
work at Johns Hopkins on health issues and at the University of 
California at Los Angeles in a study of urban poverty.

<p>

Work in adolescent issues is also a task to which Miss Hsu comes 
well-prepared.  She served as a student health advocate under the 
University of California's Department of Student Health Services 
from 1990-1991, advising her peers on an individual basis regarding 
their various emotional and physical health concerns.  She also 
gained experience by participating in California's Watts Public 
Library Literacy Program, in which she worked as a tutor for inner 
city youth.

<p>

Miss Hsu graduated <I>cum laude</I> and with College Honors from 
the University of California at Los Angeles, receiving a Bachelor 
of Arts degree in English.  She went on to graduate <I>summa cum 
laude</I> with a Masters of Health Sciences degree from the Johns 
Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore, 
Maryland.

<title>Current Proposals</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<font size=5><strong>CURRENT PROPOSALS TO CHANGE THE TAXATION OF 
SAVING</strong></font><br>
<hr>
</center>
The Flat Tax (Dick Armey), The Sales Tax (Bill Archer), The USA (Unlimited
Savings Allowance) Tax (Domenici-Nunn), and The Individual Investment
Account Act (Breaux-McCrery)
<p>

All four revolutionary tax proposals have identical prime objectives:  (1)
totally <i>eliminating</i> the double tax on saving; and (2) greatly
<i>simplifying</i> the tax system.  These objectives are entirely proper
and achievable.  What it takes is sound judgment, good leadership, and the
guts to stop the "hand-wringers" from conjuring up ghosts that drag out
and obfuscates sound analysis and action. 
<P>
Appropriate comments follow.  But first, please recognize that
the League focuses on the taxation of <i>personal saving</i>.
Corporate tax changes, while relevant, are not commented upon herein.
<P>

<b>Flat Tax</b>:<br>  

We applaud it, because it totally removes the double tax on saving.  It
has undeniable attraction via simplicity. It is challenged by some,
because they claim it is less "progressive" than they prefer.  It suffers
due to the prospective elimination of tax deductions for home mortgage
interest, charitable contributions, and certain other embedded, existing
tax provisions. 

<P>
<b>Sales Tax</b>:<br>  

Again getting rid of the double tax on saving is a major attribute.  The
champions of the sales tax stress that it removes the whole income tax
structure and effectively removes the need for any IRS-with its legions of
tax collectors.  Further, the sales tax can be adjusted to correct the
present tax imbalance on foreign imports and exports.  Some commentators
fear that the sales tax will eventually evolve into a value-added tax,
with many levels of taxation that are masked from the public.  The sales
tax concept is simple, but faces a need for public acceptance due to its
perceived regressiveness.  The states, many who rely upon sales taxes, may
fight a national sales tax. 

<P>
<b>Domenici-Nunn (N-D) USA Plan:</b><br>

The centerpiece of the USA Tax is the Unlimited Savings Allowance from
which the new tax system for America's future derives its name" (4/25/95
N-D memo).  This plan has been endorsed by the <i>Washington Post</i>. 
The N-D plan, insofar as the taxation of personal saving is concerned, is
virtually identical to in concept, and is derived from, the Individual
Investment Account Act.<p>

<b>The Individual Investment Account Act (S. 159 and H.R.
328):</b><br> 

Described by knowledgeable economists as ... "one of the boldest, most
imaginative, and most constructive pro-growth tax initiatives in many
years," this plan zeros in solely on the major fault with the existing
income tax system:  the senseless double tax on saving.  <p>

The simple, effective substance of this legislation creates an IRA-type
account for every person into which unlimited, fully tax-deductible
contributions may be made.  All assets accumulate on a tax-free basis. 
There is no penalty tax, nor forced distributions at any age.  There is no
income tax nor estate tax at death, and beneficiaries have the same tax
basis as the benefactor.  All withdrawals are taxed at ordinary income tax
rates.  The net effect of this legislation is, like the other more complex
legislation above, a zero tax on <i>after-tax income </i> that is saved
and invested.  Additionally, this act provides a simple, most desirable
"home and account" rollover procedure that helps people not only purchase
their home, but also sell their home on a sound, tax-deferred "investment
transaction "basis.

   <H1>Imagineering a State Budget</H1>
   <H3>By Tom McClintock</H3>

</center>

In Anaheim, California, the creative technicians at Disneyland use the term, 
"Imagineering" to describe the process of letting their imaginations run wild and then 
trying to engineer fantasy into reality.  In Sacramento, California, the creative politicians 
at the Capitol use the term "budgeting" to describe a similar exercise.  The principal 
difference is that the Disney folks are good at it.

<p>
The Imagineers in Sacramento have once again produced a budget that fantasizes much 
higher revenues than the state will receive, much lower expenditures than the state has 
authorized, with virtually no budget reserve.  Thus, every miscalculation will 
immediately translate into red ink, piling on to the already staggering debt load 
shouldered by California's taxpayers. 

<p>
Since 1990, California's economy has significantly <i>under</i>-performed the rest of the 
nation--dragged down by one of the heaviest tax and regulatory burdens in the country.

<p>
Nevertheless, California's new budget is based on predictions of a miraculous economic 
explosion in 1996, including a 33 percent jump in building permits. 

<p>
Last year, Californias personal income grew only half as fast as the rest of the country, 
but next year, the budget requires an economy growing a 33 percent faster than the 
nation.  Last year, Californias employment grew at only one third the national rate.  Next 
year, it must grow 25 percent faster than the rest of the country.  Taxpayers will make up 
the difference between fantasy and reality.  Meanwhile, the budget counts on a $500 
million federal gift that Washington has not even agreed to give.

<p>
In their defense, Sacramentos Imagineers are quick to point out that the budgets 
economic forecasts are "mid-range estimates, when compared to other forecasters."  
That's an important distinction, since the "other forecasters" they use for comparison have 
been very good at over-estimating the states performance in past years.  Economists like 
Arthur Laffer, who have been consistently correct in predicting Californias economy, are 
far more pessimistic.  Laffer observes that Californias economy now drags along at the 
bottom of national numbers, on its way to becoming "perpetual West Virginia."

<p>
On the expenditure side, the budget is balanced by significant and overdue cuts in social 
welfare spending.  But theres a hitch.  The cuts cant take effect until waivers are granted 
from the federal government, or federal laws are changed.

<p>
Yet the budget assumes these authorizations will soon take effect.  California will run a 
deficit up to $1.5 million every day the authorizations are delayed.  Thats a very likely 
scenario.  The state is still waiting for waivers for cuts made last year.  The same 
imprudence last year added millions of dollars to the deficit.

<p>
In addition, a number of court cases are pending against the state for past fiscal 
gimmicks.  For example, past budget games have shorted the state's pension system of 
nearly $1 billion. Court cases challenging state raids of this nature--which are part of the 
state's structural deficit--are very likely to add $2 billion to the states obligations, yet no 
reserve has been set aside.

<p>
A press release from the budgets author boasts, "Without any gimmicks, tricks, or smoke 
and mirrors, the proposed 1995-96 budget is balanced and even has a small reserve of $41 
million."  "Small" is putting it mildly. It amounts to 95/1000ths of one percent of the 
state general fund.  The Imagineers may not have relied on "smoke and mirrors," but their 
new budget will only fly with ample quantities of faith and trust--and a little of Tinker 
Belles pixie dust.

<p>
The difference between the fantasy of this years state budget and the reality of the states 
ailing economy will be measured by a growing deficit that future taxpayers will bear.  
Meanwhile, the state continues to carry at least $2.5 billion of debt from past years, or 
about $300 per family, which California taxpayers must eventually pay. 

<p>
Kudos to those few legislators who stood in the face of intimidation and pressure to vote 
against this wasteful and irresponsible budget.  The fact that this years budget was 
passed by a bi-partisan vote should not be hailed as a breech in "gridlock".  Instead, 
support for this business-as-usual budget, which will continue to drag California to its 
knees, should be seen for what it is: a sad commentary on the quality of political 
leadership in California.

Just prior to the 104th Congress, Catherine A. Deeds joined the 
Family Research Council in 1994 as a lobbyist to both the U.S. 
Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives. Her responsibilities 
include developing legislative strategy, meeting and working with 
key decision makers on Capitol Hill, and tracking current policy 
developments. With a broad understanding of the legislative 
process, Miss Deeds focuses on specific family issues that 
incorporate her policy skills and background.

<p>

Formerly a Legislative Assistant in 1993 for freshman U.S. 
Congressman Bob Inglis of South Carolina, Miss Deeds followed 
a number of domestic policy issues such as health care, labor, 
veterans, senior citizens, religion, and family.

<p>

Miss Deeds gained key legislative experience with family policy 
issues in several different arenas especially during a political 
appointment in the Bush Administration. In 1992, Miss Deeds 
assisted the management of the Office of the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Legislation in the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services. She served as a liaison and political appointee 
in the Bush Administration to over two hundred Congressional Offices 
on public health issues.

<p>

On Capitol Hill in 1991, Miss Deeds worked as Policy Analyst for 
the House Republican Study Committee where she performed extensive 
research and writing on issues including health care, civil 
rights, labor, family, and education.

<p>

In 1989, Miss Deeds established her expertise on family issues as 
she served on a House Select Committee on Children, Youth, and 
Families. This position included not only the reporting on various 
topics affecting children and families but also the screening 
of witnesses for Congressional hearings.

<p>

From 1987-1989, Miss Deeds served at Free Congress Research and 
Education Foundation as Managing Editor of the monthly Family 
Protection Report and later, Associate Editor of the twenty-four 
page, monthly Family, Law & Democracy Report.

<p>

Cathy Deeds currently serves on the board of directors at a crisis 
pregnancy center and Advisory Board for American Collegians for 
Life, has volunteered for five campaigns for pro-life candidates, 
and founded the Arlington chapter of the Virginia Society for Human 
Life.

<p>

In 1986, Cathy graduated from Marquette University with a Bachelor of 
Arts in Journalism.

</center>

Once a gladiator in the trenches of the National Football
League, now a pro-family advocate, Phillip V. Olsen joined the
Family Research Council in 1992 where he is Vice President for
Resource Development.  In his new capacity, the former professional
athlete directs his energies into marketing the pro-family, policy,
lobbying and educational organization.  As FRC takes its analysis
of pro-family policy to our nation's leaders and lawmakers, Mr.
Olsen and his Resource Development team broadcast the news about
FRC to its supporters nationwide.  His work involves the coordination
of resource development and grass roots networking as well as
the oversight of programs, activities and events that deliver
the message of FRC.

<p>

Mr. Olsen may be best known as a consensus first team collegiate
All-American Defensive End who was also a first-round NFL draft
choice in 1970. From there the two year All-American went on to
play nine years in the NFL, until his retirement in 1979.  A highly
decorated athlete during his athletic career, he was inducted
into the State of Utah Sports Hall of Fame in 1985.  He was also

<a name="family"><center><h1>Family Hopes</h1></center>
<p>
<font size=+3>C</font>ontrary to the impression left by the recent O.J. Simpson 
trial, a large majority of black Americans support get-tough efforts to combat 
crime.
<p>
According to FRC's newly released Family Issues Survey, 82 percent
of blacks favor &quot;requiring convicted criminals to work while serving their 
sentence.&quot; Seventy-seven percent favor &quot;requiring convicted criminals 
to pay their victims and their victims' families financial compensation for the
pain, suffering, and economic hardship they caused.&quot;  Moreover,
85 percent of blacks favor &quot;requiring criminals to undergo drug tests to show 
that they are drug-free before completing their sentence.&quot;
<p>
<center><h3>Choose Life</h3></center>
<p>
The FRC poll, conducted by the Voter/Consumer Research Firm, also
found that:
<p>
<li><b>Adoption is considered the best response -- and abortion the
worst response -- to an unwed pregnancy.</b>
<p>
When asked what is the best response to an unmarried pregnancy,
29 percent choose adoption, 24 percent say marrying the child's father, 11 
percent choose single motherhood, eight percent opt for abortion, and the 
rest either volunteer that &quot;it depends&quot; or say they &quot;don't 
know.&quot; Conversely, when asked which of these options would be worst, 55 
percent say abortion, 13 percent say single motherhood, 12 percent say marrying 
the child's father, and six percent choose adoption.
<p>
<li><b>Most Americans -- including rank-and-file pro-lifers -- strongly
oppose subsidizing illegitimate births.</b>
<p>
Opposition runs strong and deep to &quot;increasing a welfare
mother's monthly welfare check if she has another child out of wedlock.&quot; 
Two-thirds (66 percent) say they &quot;strongly&quot; oppose such
increases.  Another 18 percent &quot;somewhat&quot; oppose welfare
benefit increases for illegitimacy. 
<p>
Only 13 percent say these increases are justified. Among those
who &quot;strongly&quot; favor laws against abortion, 70 percent 
&quot;strongly&quot; support the family cap, and another 16 percent 
&quot;somewhat&quot; support this measure.
<p>
<li><b>The religiously devout are more apt to give and volunteer --
and say they would do more if government welfare programs were dramatically 
cut or abolished.</b>
<p>
People who attend worship services at least once a week report
higher levels of giving (97 percent) and volunteering (79 percent) than any 
other demographic group. Frequent churchgoers are also more likely to say they 
would give and volunteer more if &quot;government welfare programs
were cut back dramatically, or abolished.&quot;
<p>
<li><b>Even young people think today's popular culture encourages
teen sex, violence and drug use.</b>
<p>
When asked to assess the degree to which today's movies, television,
and music lyrics encourage teenage sex, 63 percent of young Americans say 
&quot;a great deal&quot; or &quot;quite a lot.&quot;  Fifty-six percent
offer identical responses to a question about the entertainment
industry's role in encouraging violent crime, and 47 percent say the same 
about pop culture's contribution to alcohol and drug abuse. Moreover, 75 percent 
of Americans aged 18 to 30 either &quot;strongly&quot; or &quot;somewhat&quot; 
agree with the statement, &quot;The values promoted in today's movies,
on TV, and in music lyrics do not represent my own views.&quot;
<p>
<li><b>Single parents say families need help shielding kids from harmful
cultural influences.</b>
<P>
Only 36 percent of all single parents -- and 33 percent of divorcees
-- say parents can adequately shield children from violent or sexually-explicit 
material by themselves.  Better than 60 percent of single parents agree 
with the statement, &quot;These days, it is too difficult for parents to deal 
with this alone.&quot;  Moreover, 92 percent of all those surveyed say they
do not believe public libraries should make <i>Playboy</i> magazine available 
to children without parental permission.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>FOUR FIFTHS OF AMERICANS<br>
FAVOR FAMILY TAX RELIEF.</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<li><b>Most Americans strongly support permanent tax relief for families
raising children.</b>
<p>
Roughly four out of five Americans (79 percent) favor tax relief
for families raising children. Sixty-one percent say they would rather have 
&quot;a permanent tax cut beginning next year&quot; than &quot;a
temporary tax cut beginning this year.&quot;  Only 26 percent
say they would prefer temporary relief immediately.

<p>
<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p>
<b>Partial Victory.</b> Accommodating the request of a majority of senators,
a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing was held on the Partial-Birth Abortion 
Ban Act (H.R. 1833) on Nov. 17. The bill passed the House by vote of 288-139 
on Nov. 1, drawing the votes of such infrequent supporters of abortion limits 
as Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) and freshman Rep.
Patrick Kennedy (D-R.I.).  Nurse Brenda Shafer told the Senate
committee that she assisted an Ohio abortionist with several partial-birth 
abortions, but was repulsed and then quit.  Senate floor action is likely 
before Dec. 7.  The Clinton White House continues to signal a veto.
<p><a name="gambling">
<b>Gambling Scourge.</b> Rep. Frank Wolf's bill (H.R. 497) to create
The National Gambling Impact and Policy Commission is gaining momentum. The 
bill, which has broad bipartisan support, does not outlaw, tax, or regulate 
gambling, but recognizes its growing influence. In 1993, Americans
made more trips to casinos than they did to major league ballparks.
 Today, casinos operate in 23 states, and 37 states have lotteries.  Studies 
show that gambling increases public corruption and other criminal activities. 
It cannibalizes legitimate businesses, and government's gambling-related
costs for regulation, lost productivity and family disintegration
outstrip the economic gain.
<p>
<b>Budget Break?</b> The battle between Congress and the White House
moved to the next stage Nov. 19 with an agreement to enact a balanced budget 
within seven years, using Congressional Budget Office (CBO) economic estimates. 
President Clinton reversed course and agreed to negotiate legislation by Jan. 
1 to achieve the zero deficit goal. Republican concessions on
spending control are likely.   FRC will work hard to keep the
$500-per-child tax credit in the GOP bill, as well as real spending limits 
to avoid leaving our children a legacy of debt.
<p>
<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Playing the Odds.</b> Gambling industry political action committees
(PAC) are influencing legislation such as proposals to tax gambling revenues 
and regulate the American Indian gaming boom.  Gambling is projected to grow 
to an $80-billion-per-year industry this decade. According to the Federal 
Election Commission, PACs gave $321,942 to the major political parties in 
1993-94, and four non-PAC industry gifts totaling $690,000 went to the 
Republican National Committee in 1994. Columnist William Safire warns 
that state-sponsored gambling is a &quot;cancer ravaging society, corrupting 
public officials and becoming the fastest-growing teenage addiction.&quot;
<p>
<b>Murphy Brown Sweeps.</b> According to a new Census Bureau report,
America is experiencing a rise in the number of Murphy Brown-style moms. 
The study, released in early November, shows that the proportion of 
college-educated, never-married women who have given birth has more
than doubled in the past 10 years, while the proportion of young,
single, black women giving birth has dropped. The report also says that 
the illegitimacy rate among all never-married white women rose from 6.7 
percent to 12.9 percent.  The greatest rise in this group was, indeed, among 
women who are managers and professionals.
<p><a name="divorce">
<b>Divorce, American Style.</b> The U.S. divorce rate dropped slightly
in 1994, but <i>The Economist</i> magazine reports that divorce is still more 
common in America than anywhere else in the world. To combat this problem, 
a growing number of pro-family state leaders are working to reform
divorce laws to protect individuals who want to save their marriages
rather than promote the interests of individuals initiating divorce proceedings. 
By a margin of 55 percent to 31 percent, Americans support such reforms, 
according to FRC's newly-released Family Issues Survey.
<p>
<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>
<p>
<b>FRC Intervenes.</b> In a highly unusual move, the Fourth U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals granted a motion Nov. 20 that will permit FRC to present 
oral arguments in a key case involving homosexuals in the military. The 
case <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i> is likely to reach the Supreme Court next 
year. FRC sought to intervene in the appeals court to argue that the
Clinton administration regulations at issue do not faithfully reflect 
Congressional intent and will result in allowing declared homosexuals 
to serve.  Melissa Wells-Petry, a former Army litigator, will represent 
FRC at the Dec. 5 hearing.
<p>
<b>Young Guns.</b> A quarter of those arrested on weapons charges are
juveniles, and such offenses are the fastest growing crime among adolescents. 
Juvenile weapons cases have grown 86 percent since 1985 to more than 61,000 
arrests last year, and teen gun violence has risen steadily even
though the number of teens has declined.  Weapons offenses include
illegal use, possession, importing or exporting of guns, ammunition and the 
like.  Attorney General Janet Reno warns, &quot;If the last decade's trends 
continue unchecked, juvenile arrests for violent crime will double by the
year 2010.&quot;
<p>
<b>Money Talks.</b> A record turnout of Maine voters narrowly rejected
a proposal on November's ballot to deny special rights to homosexuals.  Four 
hundred thousand voters took part in the 53 to 47 percent outcome.  
Pro-homosexual rights forces spent an unprecedented $1.2 million, 10 times 
more than those who oppose special rights.  Despite the close vote, 
homosexual activists are pushing ahead with their plans to introduce gay rights 
bills into the Maine legislature for the 10th time.  None has passed to date.

<h3>The Bare Non-Necessities</h3>
<p>
Did local schools notice the difference when 89 percent of the
U.S. Education Department's 5,500 employees were sent home as 
&quot;non-essential&quot; federal workers during the recent budget show-down? 
Equally unnoticeable is any improvement resulting from Washington D.C.'s 
recurrent attempts at top-down education reform:  National Education Goals,
the Goals Panel, Goals 2000, the National Standards for U.S. History.  With all 
the rhetoric and frenzy over initiatives with such visionary titles, you'd 
expect to see some results as 1995 draws to a close.
<p>
But when the National Education Goals Panel met in November to provide a 
halftime report on progress toward the eight National Education Goals, set in 
1990 for the year 2000, they could point to no significant improvement. 
&quot;Progress is spotty at best,&quot; said Albert Shanker, President of 
the American Federation of Teachers union.  The panelists urged patience; 
Americans put up $3 million this year to hear the Goals Panel stall for time.
<p>
Americans are growing increasingly impatient with dismal academic
test scores year after year. Recently released results from the 1994 
National Assessment of Educational Progress remain poor: less than a 
third of the students tested were proficient readers; 57 percent of high 
school seniors scored &quot;below basic&quot; in their knowledge of U.S.
history.  Writers of the National Standards for U.S. History released last 
year thought they could improve performance by imposing an official body 
of knowledge.  However, if the 30,000 copies already distributed make their 
way into classrooms, students will continue to know more about Madonna,
whom the standards mention, than they do about Robert E. Lee, whom the standards 
ignore.
<p>
Regrettably, our millions earmarked for education reform over
the past five years have been ill-spent on bureaucracy and systems management. 
Bill Bennett, former Secretary of Education, suggested in 1989, &quot;I'd 
give the education reform movement another five years.  If we're not able
to get our schools back to where they were in 1963, after spending
40 percent more, then maybe we should just declare bankruptcy, give the people 
back their money, and let them start their own schools.&quot;  Time's up. We 
want our money back.

<h3>We the Parents</h3>
<p>
FRC has taken its battle for parental rights to the Supreme
Court.  FRC joined forces with the Of the People Foundation and asked the 
high court to hear the case of Massachusetts students and parents who oppose 
a school district's program of condom distribution to junior high and high
school students.  A &quot;friend of the court&quot; petition was
filed on Nov. 15.
<p>
In early 1992 the Falmouth School District adopted a policy
whereby school nurses were instructed to distribute free condoms to students 
as young as 11 years old -- even over their parents' objections.  Condom 
machines were also installed in high school student restrooms. FRC's brief 
argues that the program violates the parents' right to direct the upbringing 
of their children as well as the right to free exercise of religion.
<p>
In 1993, New York's highest court ruled that an identical public school 
condom distribution program violated the right of parents to rear their children 
as they see fit.
<p>
This dispute highlights the need for legislation to acknowledge
and solidify parents' fundamental rights.  To accomplish this, Sen. Charles 
Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) have introduced the 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act of 1995 (H.R. 1946).  The
act establishes the fundamental right of parents to direct and
provide for the education and religious teaching of their children, and also 
addresses health care decisions and reasonable corporal discipline. Importantly, 
the act allows the government to intervene when it has a compelling interest 
to do so, and has specific allowances for cases of child abuse and neglect.
<p>
Support this much-needed legislation by calling or writing
your representatives today.

<center><font size=+2><b><i>Looking for Lincoln</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
<font size=+3>G</font>en. Colin L. Powell has declined to run for President in 
1996. He has also said that he will not accept the Vice Presidency, though 
time may change this decision. Finally, he is joining the Republican party. 
These are crucial decisions.
<p>
As everyone knows by now, Powell had described himself as 
&quot;pro-choice&quot; on abortion during an interview with ABC's 
Barbara Walters on the eve of his national book tour.  That position, 
combined with the warm reaction to his candidacy among some conservative
leaders in Washington, raised the real possibility that, for the first time 
in two decades, the Republican platform next year would reflect a 
&quot;pro-choice&quot; position on abortion.
<p>
The media response to this prospect, as well as to Powell, was
wild excitement.  From a strict news sense, it's not hard to understand why. 
A Powell candidacy presented historic opportunities: the nomination and 
possible election of the first black American President. Second, a GOP 
abandonment of its pro-life plank would have caused an earthquake
on the American political landscape.  Earthquakes are hard news.
<p>
The Republican Platform calls for a constitutional amendment to provide legal 
protection for the unborn.  It also calls for the appointment of judges who 
respect traditional values and the sanctity of innocent human life.  Has it 
made much difference?  One conservative leader has said that a pro-choice 
president like Powell &quot;could do more to lower the number of abortions 
than a presidential candidate who claims to be pro-life, who supports a 
constitutional amendment to ban abortions, but who does nothing more than pay 
lip-service to the pro-life constituency.&quot;
<p>
Of course, pro-life Americans want no part of this leader's dilemma.
 They prefer a third way: someone, Republican or Democratic, who not only claims 
to be, but is, pro-life, who supports full legal protection for the unborn, 
and who will pay service to that goal in both speech and action.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>PERSISTENCE ISN'T<br>
ALWAYS APPRECIATED.</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
So why are pro-life Americans so often made to feel like skunks at the wedding 
party?  Partly, I'm sure, it's because nothing is more alien to the modern 
American mind than a moral absolute, even when that absolute is the 
overwhelming duty to refrain from taking innocent human life.  Second,
there is the matter of persistence.  It isn't always appreciated.
<p>
In his <i>Lincoln: The War Years</i>, Carl Sandburg retells the story
of a White House reception after Lincoln's Second Inaugural. Frederick 
Douglass, the black anti-slavery leader, tried to enter the White House 
to greet the President.  Guards barred his way.  Douglass eluded them 
and rushed through the door.  He was seized and escorted to a plank that
led outside through a window. Once again on the street, he asked a 
passerby entering the White House to tell Lincoln that &quot;Frederick 
Douglass is detained by officers at the door.&quot;
<p>
Hearing the news, Lincoln invited Douglass into the East Room, and the 
journalist finally greeted the reelected president.  Lincoln told Douglass 
that he had seen him in the crowd listening to his address. &quot;There 
is no man's opinion that I value more than yours,&quot; Lincoln told him, 
&quot;what do you think of it?&quot;  Douglass replied, &quot;Mr. Lincoln, 
it was a sacred effort.&quot;
<p>
In this world of slippery slope relativism, where rights to do
wrong are enshrined among our political commandments, the pro-life cause 
is often treated like an unwelcome guest.  As 1996 approaches, some of 
the political &quot;palace guards&quot; are already trying to show us to the 
window again.  As they do so, we could use a little of the spirit of
Frederick Douglass.  After all, this cause is a sacred effort, too.

<center><h1>A NATION MOURNS</h1></center>

<p>

<font size=+3>O</font>n April 10, President Bill Clinton vetoed the 
Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act (PBA).  With a stroke of his pen, Clinton 
continued to authorize abortion on demand, leaving to the abortionist 
the gruesome method of his choice.

<p>

And gruesome it is. In a partial-birth abortion, a child between
five and nine months of gestation is delivered -- all but the head --
and living brain tissue is vacuumed out after the child is stabbed
at the base of the skull with surgical scissors.  A top physician
testified before Congress that babies subjected to this process
most certainly feel pain.  Strangely, if a &quot;mistake&quot;
were made and the child slipped out of the mother, he would be
legally human and fully protected from being killed.

<p>

<center><h3>Broad Support</h3></center>

<p>

The brutality of this technique seemed capable of delivering a
first -- the first federal restriction of abortion since the 1973
<I>Roe v. Wade</I> Supreme Court decision.  In fact, Rep. Patricia
Schroeder (D-Colo.) fought to keep pictorials of the procedure
off the House floor, but the pro-life side carried the day, winning
the votes of House and Senate members who had never cast a pro-life
vote in their careers.  Winning margins in the House were 288-139
and 286-129, and in the Senate, 54-44.

<p>

When the bill went to the White House on Good Friday, it included
an exception allowing the procedure if necessary to save a mother
whose life &quot;is endangered by a physical disorder, illness
or injury.&quot;  The bill also received important symbolic support.
Many national leaders called for the President to approve it,
including liberal columnists and prominent clergy.  Several Catholic
bishops, including two cardinals, endured a soaking rain on April
1 to pray outside the White House.

<p>

When Bill Clinton vetoed the bill, beside him stood five women
who had experienced troubled pregnancies.  The setting was designed
to suggest that PBA had been the only answer to their trauma.

<p>

But it was not even clear that the women beside him had undergone
PBA, according to transcripts of the President's remarks and
media accounts.  The President said, &quot;The emotional power
of the description of the procedure -- which I might add did not
cover the procedure these women had ... was so great ...&quot;
He also cited the bill's omission of an exception for the &quot;health&quot;
of the mother -- a term defined so broadly by the courts that, PBA
supporters say, it means unrestricted abortion.

<p>

<center><h3>Feeling Pain</h3></center>

<p>

Many myths have been reported as fact in the PBA debate.  Among
the cruelest is that anesthesia kills the baby before the procedure
is carried out, a falsehood that, dangerously, only scares many
pregnant mothers needing legitimate surgery.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
MANY MYTHS HAVE BEEN<br>
REPORTED AS FACT.
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

The decision on whether to attempt an override of the President's
veto rests first with the House leadership.  Since PBA began in
the House, the vetoed bill has been returned there.  If two-thirds
of the House votes to override the veto (a margin previously achieved),
then it would go to the Senate. The initial vote in the Senate
was short of the two-thirds margin needed for adoption.

<p>

The veto comes at a time when recent polls show that more than
two-thirds of Americans support either restrictions on abortion
or an end to PBA altogether.

<p>

&quot;I am among the majority of Americans who know that our nation
has more to offer than abortion,&quot; Family Research Council
President Gary L. Bauer said.  &quot;This is a time for us to
pray for the return of a respect for life, born out of our Judeo-Christian
heritage and honored by our nation's founders.  Our future depends
on it.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>

<p>

Write your member of Congress and two senators and urge them to
continue to press for enactment of the PBA.  Write or call FRC
(1-800-225-4008) and obtain a copy of our free packet (PK033) 
describing the truth about PBA's and the need
for federal legislation.  Thomas Jefferson once said that he trembled
for his country when he reflected that God is just.  A nation
that will not protect children (and mothers) at the very threshold
of birth has reason to tremble -- and to mourn.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Omnibus Riders.</b> A new omnibus spending bill (H.R. 3019)
may include several pro-family provisions.  The Coats amendment,
which passed the Senate 63-37, would protect medical schools from
losing federal funds if they ignore an abortion mandate issued
by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. 
The mandate requires medical students specializing in obstetrics
to be trained in performing elective abortions.  House and Senate
conferees on the bill are also expected to maintain restrictions
on District of Columbia abortion funding and on international
population assistance to groups that perform elective abortions.

<p>

<b>Health Savings.</b> The House recently passed a health reform
bill (H.R. 3103) by a vote of 267-151.  FRC supported the bill,
which includes 100 percent tax-free medical savings accounts for
families and individuals.  MSA's allow working families to choose
their own doctors and make their own health care spending decisions.
An amendment by Sen. Robert Dole to include MSA's in the Senate
bill, cosponsored by Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) and Ted Kennedy
(D-Mass.), was defeated, 52-46, under a veto threat from President
Clinton if MSA's were adopted.

<p>

<b>Et Tu, Newt?</b> House Speaker Newt Gingrich gave a speech
on March 24 endorsing a candlelight AIDS march that benefits pro-homosexual
organizations. Among them are the Whitman-Walker Clinic, which
treats AIDS victims but also runs homosexual activist workshops,
promotes lesbian parenting, and places &quot;safe sex&quot; ads
in a Washington homosexual newspaper that promotes strip clubs
and bathhouses.  The newspaper noted that Gingrich credited Rep.
Steve Gunderson (R-Wis.) for asking him to publicize the march.
Gingrich also credited Gunderson's homosexual partner.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p><a name="fda">

<b>Rubber Stamp.</b> After experimenting on 2,100 pregnant American
women, the Population Council recently filed a petition with
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to request approval for
the abortion drug, RU 486. FDA Commissioner David Kessler had
earlier suggested that the FDA would put RU-486 on a fast-track
review process, perhaps approving the drug within six months.
FRC condemns any action by the FDA that would legitimize, for
the first time ever, a drug that would have no other use except
to kill innocent human life.

<p>

<b>Fostering Failure.</b> Dr. Henry Foster, head of a new Presidential
teen pregnancy task force, appeared with several pro-teen contraceptive
advocates at an April 10 Capitol Hill briefing.  The panelists
criticized abstinence-only programs, despite their proven effectiveness
in reducing teenage sexual activity and sexually transmitted diseases.
The panelists stressed instead more vigorous sex education programs,
increased use of contraception, and self-esteem programs. A hand-out
they distributed claimed that &quot;abstinence until marriage&quot;
programs and programs to produce &quot;secondary virginity&quot;
have not been shown to work.

<p>

<b>MIT Saber-Rattling.</b> On March 20, a Massachusetts Institute
of Technology faculty task force announced that it wants to open
the college's Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program to
avowed homosexuals.  The task force encourages universities nationwide
to rethink their relationship with the ROTC and their adherence
to its homosexual policy. MIT risks losing $56 million, 16 percent
of its annual research budget, because of a 1996 law that denies
Pentagon dollars to any institution that has an anti-ROTC policy.
Last year, ROTC commissioned 7,200 officers, barely reaching
the Pentagon's goal.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p><a name="marriage">

<b>States of Matrimony.</b> Kansas has become the fifth state
to enact a law protecting marriage, joining Hawaii, Utah, South
Dakota and Georgia.  Other states are also acting against an expected
Hawaiian court ruling that may legalize homosexual &quot;marriage&quot;
licenses, which could then be imposed on other states under the
Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution.  In Hawaii,
the Senate also voted 24-0 specifically to ban same-sex 
&quot;marriage.&quot; The vote boosts the state's case in the suit 
brought by three homosexual couples that triggered the controversy.

<p>

<b>Ornery.</b> The Republican and Democratic political establishments
were both thwarted by insurgent candidacies in the April 9 Texas
primary runoff.  Former Congressman Ron Paul beat incumbent Republican
Greg Laughlin, a recent party-switcher.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich
was among those who campaigned vigorously for Laughlin. Both
candidates had vied for the support of pro-family activists.  In
the Democratic race for U.S. Senate, school teacher Victor Morales
defeated veteran Congressman John Bryant despite Bryant's support
from former Gov. Ann Richards and labor unions, including the
Texas Federation of Teachers.

<p>

<b>Revisionists Revise.</b> Revisionist historians missed the
U.S. landing on the moon and the presidency of George Washington
in their first, politically correct attempt back in 1994 to devise
national history standards. Now the latest revision, just released,
re-defines the family as &quot;a group of people from whom we receive
love and support.&quot;  The standards also endorse President
Clinton's embattled Goals 2000 plan and, for good measure, put
in a plug for equalized school funding nationwide.  Some conservative
critics were assuaged, but the standards remain a biased political
document.

<h3>Implementing Beijing</h3>

<p>

Despite the fact that most women in the world marry and have
children at some point in their lives, the family remained a non-issue
at the 40th session of the United Nations Commission on the Status
of Women (CSW) which met in New York in mid-March.  The CSW is
planning the implementation of the Platform for Action of last
autumn's Beijing Women's Conference.

<p>

There was no statement at the session that the family had
value, no effort to protect or shore it up now that it is under
siege, not even an invocation of the UN's usual definition of
the family as &quot;the basic unit of society.&quot; 

<p>

Most of the meeting revolved about the issues of &quot;women
and poverty&quot; and &quot;women and child and dependent care.&quot;
Noting that women constitute the majority of the world's poor,
the Commission urged governments to undertake education and training
programs and to adopt legislation promoting women's rights to
inheritance, land ownership and political decision-making.  The
&quot;dependent care&quot; debate urged redistribution of responsibilities
in the home and more part-time work, child care services and elder
care.

<p>

The session ended with the adoption of strong resolutions
condemning traffic in women and girls (a growing problem especially
in some developing countries) and wartime violence against civilians.
The Commission also approved the UN's System-Wide Plan of Action
(known as SWIMTEP) for implementing the Beijing Platform, including
its controversial provisions for health and &quot;reproductive
rights,&quot; which many UN advocacy groups hold to include abortion
and contraceptive programs for girls.

<p>

Among the tasks which SWIMTEP assigned regarding reproductive
rights were: a directive for the World Health Organization (WHO),
UNICEF and UNESCO to report on promotion of these rights to the
UN Population Division; a directive to the WHO 
and the UN Fund for Population to provide governments with technical
guidelines on methods of family planning and community distribution
of contraceptives; and a directive to UN agencies to provide special
programs for youth regarding sexual behavior.  (These directives
make no mention of parental rights or the influence of religious
or ethical traditions.)

<h3>FRC's Day in Court</h3>

<p>

On April 5, FRC received good news from a federal appeals
court in a pace-setting military homosexual case, <I>Thomasson
v. Perry</I>.  In this case, a homosexual sailor challenged both
the law passed by Congress and the Clinton administration regulations
on homosexuality in the armed forces.

<p>

The full court of 13 judges heard oral argument in December,
including argument presented by FRC's Military Readiness Project.
The MRP had filed two briefs in this case, both of which thoroughly
exposed the administration's failure to implement the law.

<p>

The law Congress passed is very clear:  no homosexuals in
the military.  But this binding expression of the will of the
American people has not stopped the administration from creating
regulatory loopholes through which homosexuals not only could
serve, but could serve openly in the military.

<p>

In <I>Thomasson,</I> the majority federal judges said, &quot;no
way.&quot; They cited FRC by name as they ruled that the Clinton
regulations on homosexuals are invalid.  The judges declared that
the administration deliberately mischaracterized the law and deliberately
shaded its answers to Congress when concerned members tried to
pin down exactly how the White House was implementing the new
statute.

<p>

Meanwhile,  the MRP was in court April 8 to hear <I>Richenberg
v. Perry</I>, a federal appeals case involving a homosexual Air
Force officer.   Predictably, the government mischaracterized
the law, but for the first time a government lawyer spoke of the
increased risk of AIDS posed by homosexuals serving.

<p>

Government counsel quoted a gay activist, &quot;I didn't
fight all my life to remain celibate&quot; and used an illustration.
If an airman identifies himself as an F16 pilot, can't the military
reasonably infer that he flies?  The counsel said the military
excludes homosexuals for a similar reason.  After all, soldiers
who identify themselves as homosexuals will engage in illicit
behavior. The court in <I>Thomasson</I> found this logic compelling.

<font size=+2><b><i>The &quot;Big Blue&quot; Summit</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>&quot;A</font>t the end of today, give me your badge, your 
desk key and everything that belongs to IBM,&quot; Charlene Mitchell
remembers her manager saying to her.  &quot;Go home and don't
come back.&quot;  Mrs. Mitchell told <I>The Washington Post</I>
how she was &quot;surplused&quot; in 1993 by the computer giant,
known for decades as &quot;Big Blue.&quot;  It was a bitter pill
for Mrs. Mitchell to swallow.  She was the third generation in
her family to work for IBM.

<p>

Charlene Mitchell was just one of 12,500 layoffs by IBM in
the Washington area since 1987.  Nationally, more than 3.2 million
Americans have gotten pink slips from large multinational corporations
over a recent six-year period.  Many layoffs are inevitable, of
course, but controversial firing practices have become &quot;business
as usual&quot; under the leadership of a new crop of corporate
high-rollers.

<p>

IBM's chief, Lou Gerstner, Jr, bluntly told the nation's
governors in 1995 that they should &quot;confront and expel&quot;
anyone they saw as a barrier to achievement of the national education
goals. He invited them to a summit last month at IBM's New York
conference center:  &quot;We'll pull it all together,&quot; he
said.  Pull it he did.  Gerstner ruled discussion of parental
choice out of order, even though he conceded that the &quot;public
education system is broken.&quot;

<p>

Gerstner clashed with Gov. George Allen (R-Va.) behind closed
doors when the conservative opposed national curricula and national
tests.  How could Gerstner force the governors to accept his edicts?
He pointedly reminded them and the press that IBM is already
the largest employer in North Carolina and Vermont.  He enlisted
other corporate bigs into making the same threat: reform our
way or face a hiring boycott of your states.

<p>

It's ironic to be battling over education standards now.
Pro-family conservatives were among the first recruits for the
education reform movement of the 1980's.  We cheered when my boss,
Bill Bennett, called for &quot;Content, Character and Choice.&quot;
We battled the &quot;dumbing down&quot; of American education.
We wanted teachers who can teach and school curricula that emphasize
the basics:  reading, writing, math, history and reliable standards
of right and wrong.  Instead, we've seen the education reform
movement hijacked by people who have given such &quot;triumphs&quot;
as vague, behavioral Outcome-Based Education (OBE) and anti-American
history standards.

<p>

Nobody has greater concern for the future economic success
of America's young graduates than their own parents.  But it's
a mistake to look at education as just a matter of work force
preparation. Education is primarily about family, faith
and freedom.  It must pass on the heritage of Western Civilization.
When we concentrate on basics, when we respect parents' rights
and the authority of locally elected school boards, excellence
will follow.

<p>

One corporate executive at the IBM summit admitted as much.
He described his state of New Hampshire. They still have New
England town meetings to discuss school issues, he said, and parents
are actively engaged in their children's education.  The result:
top scores for New Hampshire kids on national tests, even though
the state spends very little per pupil.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center>
<i><font size=+2>&quot;I LIKE THE NEW HAMPSHIRE<br>
MODEL.&quot;</font></i>
</center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

I like the New Hampshire model, not the German model that
is increasingly put forward by Marc Tucker, a liberal education
theorist and close associate of Hillary and Bill Clinton.  In
the same issue of <I>Newsweek</I> (April 8) where Jonathan Alter
touted the German model for education and job training, the magazine's
&quot;Business&quot; section reported a German unemployment rate
twice ours. Mercedes-Benz is building factories outside Germany
for the first time in its history.  There is serious division
in German society -- East-West splits, anti-immigrant violence,
and skinhead, directionless youth.

<p>

We can have excellent schools if we respect parental rights,
institute parental choice and uphold our free institutions.  We
should not try to make our kids over in anyone else's image: 
Let Americans be Americans!
