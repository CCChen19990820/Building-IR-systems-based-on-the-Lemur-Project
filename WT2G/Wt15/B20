<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The American economy currently exhibits relatively low levels of inflation, interest rates, and unemployment. Yet millions of workers remain anxious about their economic security. The relatively good economic news, combined with the widespread dissatisfaction among Americans with the nation's economic performance, seems to be a paradox. But an analysis of underlying policies and economic trends suggests an answer to this puzzle.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Using the Washington University Macro Model (WUMM)<sup>1</sup> -- a major economic model of the U.S. economy also used by the federal government and many <I>Fortune</I> 500 companies -- economists at The Heritage Foundation investigated how the economy would likely be performing today had Congress not raised taxes in 1993 as the nation was coming out of the 1990-1991 recession.<sup>2</sup>  The results of this analysis shed light on why Americans are so anxious about the economy's performance. According to the Heritage analysis, the 1993 tax hike, championed by the Clinton White House, did indeed produce what some critics have referred to as a "Clinton Crunch" -- a larger tax bite for families combined with a stagnation in incomes and an economy performing well below its potential.<sup>3</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage analysis indicates that, compared with how the economy would have performed without the 1993 tax legislation, Clinton's 1993 tax and budget plan will have:
<img src="bg1078t1.gif" width=408 height=459 border=0 alt="Table 1" align=right><ul><P>
<li><b>Cost the economy $208 billion in output</b> from 1993 through 1996,<sup>4</sup> in today's dollars.<sup>5</sup>  This lost output is equal to nearly $2,100 for every household in America. Last year, without the 1993 economic package, gross domestic product (GDP) would have grown $66 billion more than it actually did absent the change.
<p>
<li><b>Cut the number of private jobs created by 1.2 million</b> between 1993 and the end of 1996. Including the forecast for 1997, the total employment cost of the 1993 tax increase grows to nearly 1.4 million lost job opportunities.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Delivered only 49 percent of the new revenues predicted</b> by the Congressional Budget Office from the increase in personal and corporate tax rates between FY 1994 and FY 1996. When compared with the 1.2 million lost jobs, the tax hike has depressed potential employment growth by 17,600 jobs for every $1 billion it achieved in deficit reduction.
<p>
<li><b>Cut $112 billion, in today's dollars, out of potential employee wages and salaries</b> between 1993 and 1996.
<p>
<li><b>Cut the growth in real personal disposable income</b> of Americans by $264 billion in today's dollars between 1993 and 1996 -- equal to over $2,600 less disposable income for every household in America.
<p>
<li><b>Cut the potential sale of automobiles by 773,700 and light trucks by 504,000</b> between 1993 and 1996. Some 1.1 million of the nearly 1.3 million <a href="bg1078c5.gif">lost vehicle sales</a> would have been produced domestically. In 1996, Heritage calculates that this loss in auto and truck sales will cost a projected 60,100 jobs across all industries.
<p>
<li><b>Cut the value of business investment in durable goods by $42.5 billion</b> in today's dollars; $15.4 billion of this is lost investment in computers.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some proponents may argue that even if the economy is not performing up to its potential today, this slow growth period is necessary to reduce federal deficit spending which, in turn, will promote greater future growth. Yet many respected economists maintain that this will not be the case with the 1993 tax increase and budget deal: Increased taxes (and particularly increased marginal tax rates) will permanently decrease economic activity below its potential.<sup>7</sup>  Similarly, the Heritage analysis, using the WUMM economic model and forecasts of future economic activity, supports this theory. According to the Heritage analysis, nearly every major economic indicator is projected to be weaker under current law than would have been possible without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget act between now and 2004. Specifically:
<ul><P>
<li><b>Gross domestic product is projected to be lower in each year.</b> In 2004 alone, GDP is projected to be $122.5 billion lower in today's dollars than would have been possible without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
<p>
<li><b>Real personal disposable income is projected to be lower each year.</b> In 2004 alone, Americans will see $142 billion less in disposable income than would be possible without the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
</ul><P>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In short, American workers are right to feel that they should be better off today than they are. President Clinton's 1993 economic plan turns out to have deprived Americans of a higher standard of living by cutting the economy's growth potential, leading to a slower rise in employee compensation, household income, industrial output, and most other measures of a prosperous economy. 
<p>
<b>HOW IS THE ECONOMY REALLY PERFORMING?</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite a flow of quite good economic news in recent months, many Americans feel anxious about their economic security, complaining of stagnating family incomes, less money in their paychecks after taxes, and a belief that the economy is performing below its full potential. They simply do not accept that the economy is, as the President claims, the "healthiest it has been in 30 years." 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the latest <I>Economic Report of the President</I>, the White House maintains that the general health of the economy is good and credits the creation of 8 million new jobs to the passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93), which, the report says, "set the stage for this economic expansion and resurgence, by enacting historic deficit reduction while continuing to invest in technology and education."<sup>8</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By contrast, House Majority Leader Richard Armey (R-TX) cites OBRA-93, which enacted the largest tax increase in history, as the culprit for the anxiety Americans are now feeling. Calling this condition the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/lect556.html">"Clinton Crunch,"</a><sup>9</sup> Armey claims workers are experiencing the dual effect of an actual decline in real wages and higher taxes. With fewer of their own dollars in their pockets to meet the needs of their families, he says, workers understandably have a heightened sensitivity to changing economic conditions, corporate layoffs, and downsizing.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Who is right?  Is the economy performing up to its potential, as claimed by the White House?  Or are Americans suffering from the "Clinton Crunch," as claimed by Armey?
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Americans have good reason to be confused about the direction in which the nation's economy is headed. On the one hand, there is good news in statistics showing continued economic growth, relatively low unemployment, and record highs in the stock market. And as the Clinton Administration points out, the economy has created nearly 8 million jobs over the past three years, 93 percent of them in the private sector. Clinton also claims credit for reducing the federal budget deficit for three consecutive years: According to the <I>Economic Report of the President</I>, passage of the 1993 economic plan "put the country solidly on the road to fiscal responsibility."<sup>10</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But other economic statistics indicate a less rosy picture for Americans in recent years. For example, existing studies and government data indicate: 
<p><ul>
<li> Since 1992, real median family income has stagnated even though more adult women are working than ever before.<sup>11</sup>  Since September 1993, both real average hourly earnings and real average weekly earnings have stagnated.<sup>12</sup>
<P>
<li>Since the third quarter of 1993, the real median weekly earnings for women have decreased 3.0 percent, while men's real earnings have stagnated.<sup>13</sup>  Over the same period, real hourly compensation (which includes benefits as well as wages) has not increased significantly.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
<li>Fifty percent of major U.S. companies eliminated jobs in the twelve months ending June 1995, up from 47 percent the year before.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
<li>More Americans are working two or more jobs to make ends meet. In March 1996, 7.9 million Americans were working two or more jobs, up 10.2 percent since March 1994.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
<li>Less than one-third of all workers displaced from full-time jobs found new jobs that pay the same as their old ones.<sup>17</sup>   The median weekly earnings of their new jobs averaged 8.2 percent less than their old jobs, and over 14 percent less for workers 45 to 55 years old.<sup>18</sup>
<p>
<li>
From March 1995 to March 1996, 325,000 high-paying manufacturing jobs disappeared.<sup>19</sup>
</ul><p>
<b>THE ECONOMY IS LAGGING BEHIND PREVIOUS EXPANSIONS</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, while the economy is no longer in a recession, and indeed is experiencing modest growth, many Americans are still having trouble making ends meet and corporate layoffs have many workers thinking twice about the security of their jobs. But is this just part of a typical business cycle?  Experience suggests "no."  Although total employment has increased in recent years, the current economic expansion -- which began in March 1991 and is now some 59 months long -- is not progressing as well as it should when compared with the three previous post-World War II expansions lasting longer than 58 months. These expansions occurred from February 1961 to December 1969, from March 1975 to January 1980, and from November 1982 to July 1990.<sup>20</sup>  The failure of this economy to perform as well as similar expansions gives a clue as to why many Americans are concerned about their economic future.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is interesting to compare this expansion with the average of these previous expansions. To be sure, the patterns of each expansion do differ, so data for each expansion are provided in <a href="bg1078t2.gif">Table 2</a>, as well as the average. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the current expansion:
<ul><p>
<li>The gross domestic product has increased less than half as much as the average of previous post-war recoveries. Industrial production has increased just over half as much.
<p>
<li><a href="bg1078t2.gif">Total employment</a> has grown only half as much as the average of previous post-war recoveries.
<p>
<li>The number of high-paying manufacturing jobs has <I>declined</I> by 273,000, compared with an average <I>increase</I> of almost 2 million at a similar point during previous economic expansions.
<p>
<li>The number of unemployed Americans has declined by less than half the number during previous economic expansions.
<p>
<li>Real median family income has <I>declined</I> by a total of 3.2 percent during the first four years of this expansion, compared with an average <I>increase</I> of 8.8 percent during the first four years of previous expansions.<sup>21</sup> 
<p>
<li>Real median weekly earnings for full-time workers have <I>declined</I> by 2.6 percent during the current expansion, compared with an <I>increase</I> of 3.1 percent during the 1982 to 1986 expansion.<sup>22</sup>
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, despite the Administration's cheerful outlook, the economy is not performing well when compared with similar points during the three previous expansions of similar lengths. The question is "why?"  Would the economy have been performing less well today without OBRA-93, as the Clinton Administration claims, or did the tax increase slow down an economy in recovery and put many workers into a wage and job squeeze, as critics claim?
<p>
<b>THE 1993 BUDGET DEAL</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Virtually all economists agree that Washington can alter the course of the economy to some degree through its tax and spending decisions. This influence is particularly evident when Congress and the President enact tax and spending policies that affect income from work or investment. For example, Washington can reduce employment and workers' take-home pay by increasing tax rates on wages and salaries. Higher rates take money directly out of workers' pockets and make work less attractive. Conversely, lower tax rates increase the incentives for men and women to work, start new businesses, or invest in training and equipment for workers. In short, tax rate changes either lower or raise the cost of labor, depending on the direction of the rate movement. Commonly, lowering labor costs leads to a higher demand for labor. When combined with lower capital costs stemming from lower taxes on capital, greater levels of economic activity are attained.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When Congress and the President adopt policies that alter economic life in some significant fashion, there will be a difference between how the economy then performs and how it would have performed had policy not been changed. These differences between actual and potential performance can be estimated statistically using models of the U.S. economy that capture the economic impact of policy changes. Generally speaking, these models allow analysts to "simulate" the impact of tax and spending decisions that could have been made -- or not made -- by Congress and the President, and then compare the simulation with what actually occurred. This is what the Congressional Budget Office routinely does when Congress is considering tax and spending legislation.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There have been two major tax and spending plans enacted in recent years. These were in 1990 and 1993. American taxpayers were told that large tax increases in each of these plans would lead to a significant reduction in federal deficits and spur long-term economic growth. In this study, Heritage analysts used the WUMM model to investigate the effects of the 1993 budget deal. There were two reasons for the decision to focus on the 1993 agreement: First, by 1993, the economy was largely in recovery from the 1990-1991 recession, so the impact on the expansion of the 1993 plan could be isolated more easily. And, second, focusing on the 1993 economic plan allowed analysts to test the Clinton thesis that the plan has produced "the healthiest economy in three decades."<sup>23</sup>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The 1993 budget plan (OBRA-93) raised taxes $241 billion over five years and called for $77 billion in entitlement program savings and $69 billion in discretionary program savings by 1998.<sup>24</sup>  The tax law changes included two new personal tax brackets (36 and 39.6 percent) and an extension of the Medicare payroll tax to cover all wages. The motor fuel tax was increased 4.3 cents per gallon, and the tax on Social Security recipients' income from personal savings was increased. Congress and the President agreed to raise the corporation income tax to 35 percent and to restrict business meal and entertainment deductions. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The small entitlement savings came mostly from reductions in Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals and increased charges to Medicare beneficiaries. OBRA-93 delayed cost of living adjustments for military and civil service retirees and limited Medicaid payments to the states. Small reductions also were made in veterans benefits, farm programs, and student loans.
<p>
<b>THE FINDINGS</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The comparison of the real and simulated economies suggests that OBRA-93 was not as beneficial to the economy as the White House claims. Indeed, it damaged the economy and living standards in several ways. Specifically, the Heritage analysis finds that:
<ol><p>
<b><li>Economic growth has been slowed. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economy would have grown significantly faster without the Clinton tax increases and spending reductions of 1993. These policy changes will have cost the economy <a href="bg1078c2.gif">$208 billion</a> in today's dollars in output from 1993 through 1996, equivalent to nearly $2,100 in lost GDP for every household in America. In 1995, GDP would have grown by nearly 0.90 percent more, or $66 billion in today's dollars, than it actually did. The model forecasts that GDP in 1997 will be 1.0 percent lower than it could be without the 1993 tax hike, or about $95.5 billion in today's dollars.
<p>
<b><li> The pace of business formation has been slowed. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Heritage analysis shows more new businesses would have been incorporated without Clinton's 1993 package. This is due to the relationship between gross domestic product and new business incorporation. In general, for every $1 billion in GDP, about 195 new businesses are incorporated. Thus, the $208 billion fall in GDP due to the 1993 legislation will have prevented the formation of 40,600 new businesses between 1993 and the end of 1996.<sup>25</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> The loss of new businesses means not only a loss of valuable entrepreneurs, but also the loss of many new jobs. The Small Business Administration (SBA) estimates that five new jobs are created with each new business establishment. Using the SBA estimate, the loss of 40,600 new businesses between 1993 and 1996 will have meant the loss of 203,000 new jobs.
<p>
<b><li>Job growth has been slowed. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economy produced 1.2 million fewer private sector jobs between 1993 and 1996 than it would have without the tax increase and budget changes of 1993. President Clinton claims credit for more than eight million new jobs during his Administration, so far, with roughly seven million of these in the private sector. But the Heritage analysis indicates that 1.2 million <I>additional</I> Americans could have been working without his policy changes. If the forecast for 1997 is added to these figures, the total private employment cost of the tax increase grows to nearly 1.4 million.<sup>26</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It must be noted that the loss of potential civilian employment is one of the more remarkable findings of the analysis, based on the model's design. It is also one of the more controversial. While it is the Heritage Foundation's policy to accept the model's macroeconomic results and assumptions (other than the action of the Fed -- see box, page 8) and not make adjustments in these results through statistical work performed outside the model, this particular effect of OBRA-93 deserves a brief explanation. The model's measurement of how much employment will change when taxes change (the so-called tax elasticity of employment) sits roughly in the middle of the professionally accepted range for such measurements: The model contains a factor of .29 percent change for every one percent change in labor income, and the standard range among economists goes from .12 to .37 percent. These elasticities mean that a 10 percent increase in take-home pay leads to an increase in the labor supply of between 1.2 and 3.7 percent. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The designers of the WUMM model caution users regarding the output of the model's employment equations. However, Heritage economists decided to accept the model's results because further investigations and calculations using other data bases gave general support to the conclusions in this Heritage study. If the rate changes associated with OBRA-93's increases in payroll and income taxes are applied only to the incomes of those with more than $70,000 in income, we calculate that potential employment was at least 350,000. Of course, the increase in tax rates also negatively affected investment decisions, which resulted in slower growth of job-creating new businesses and business expansion. For example, Heritage calculates that the loss in potential capital stock may account for an additional decrease of 470,000 jobs. When these and other capital effects are combined with the direct and minimal employment effects, the calculation derived from the model of 1.2 million in 1996 between actual and potential employment appears reasonable.<sup>27</sup>  Even using lower elasticities favored by some economists would mean an employment effect of at least 400,000 lost jobs.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> Heritage calculates approximately 203,000 of the potential lost jobs between 1993 and the end of 1996 were a result of new businesses that were not formed. The remainder of lost potential jobs, some 1 million, most probably results from existing businesses that hired fewer employees than they otherwise would have or expanded less.
<p>
<b><li>The growth in household income and savings has been cut. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When the job losses are combined with higher taxes on working families, a disturbing picture of lost household income growth emerges. 
<p><ul>
<li><b>The growth in wages and salaries has been cut.</b> The 1993 legislation will have cut $112 billion, in today's dollars, out of employee wages and salaries between 1993 and 1996, when compared with the pattern that otherwise would have occurred. Extending the analysis to 1997 would mean $162 billion in total lost wages and salaries, again in today's dollars.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> In 1996 alone, the Heritage analysis shows that the Clinton program depressed the growth in wages and salaries by $46.5 billion in today's dollars, roughly $465 for every household in America. The loss of potential income means that families spent less than they could have spent on food, clothing, transportation, medical care, and other necessities for their families. Indeed, in a typical month, the average household spends $251 on groceries, $160 on medical costs, and $40 on education.<sup>28</sup>  The addition of $465 in purchasing power for the typical household means an average of 1.8 months of groceries, or 2.9 months of medical bills, or 12 months of educational expenses in a typical year.
<ul><p>
<li><b>The growth in personal disposable income has been cut.</b> The 1993 budget deal raised taxes on millions of American households and will have cut overall real personal disposable income by $264 billion in today's dollars from 1993 through 1996 -- equal to over $2,600 less disposable income for every household in America. In 1996, households will have nearly 2 percent, or $101 billion, less money to spend on education, food, medical care, and other items than they would have had without the 1993 legislation.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> Total personal disposable income measures both wage income and non-wage income from such things as investments. Besides lost future wages, the Heritage analysis shows that the Clinton tax increase and budget plan will have cost households $152 billion in non-wage income, in today's dollars, between 1993 and the end of 1996. This is equal to $1,500 for every American household. In 1996 alone, the average household will realize $550 less in non-wage disposable income, nearly double the amount the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates the average household spends on appliances each year.<sup>29</sup>  Many households use income from non-wage sources to make large purchases such as the down payment on a new car, a washing machine, and other appliances. Alternatively, families may use this income to finance extraordinary events such as weddings, college education, or vacations.
<p><ul>
<li><b>The growth in personal savings has been cut.</b> Between 1993 and the end of 1996, the 1993 budget plan will have reduced personal savings by roughly $138 billion in today's dollars. This cut in family savings means that future consumption of the things for which families save, principally housing and education, will be lower than it would have been. If 1997 is included, savings will have been cut by a total of $192 billion, in today's dollars.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> The three things households save for most are education, housing, and retirement. To illustrate the impact of these lost savings, Heritage analysts distributed the $138 billion in lost savings to families with children, young families saving to purchase a home, and those saving for retirement, based upon age and population. We then assumed that this amount would grow at an everyday interest rate of 5 percent, to see what important purchases these three groups could make in the future with their respective accumulated savings. Each of the following amounts is what could be purchased with the future value of each group's portion of the $138 billion in lost savings:<sup>30</sup>
<p><ul>
<li>$432 billion for higher education expenses; and
<p>
<li>$335 billion for buying homes; and
<p>
<li>$3.6 trillion for retirement.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Had the portion of this $138 billion we allocated to families with children been allowed to earn interest for the average number of years available for savings in the under-18 age group, then the cumulative amount could have purchased a four-year college education for 7 million students at $14,000. Had the foregone savings we allocated to young families saving to purchase a home (the age group 18 to 35), been allowed to grow for 18 years, the total sum could have resulted in 17 million future home sales where a $20,000 down payment is required. And had the portion of this $138 billion allocated to people above the age of 35 -- those saving for retirement -- been allowed to grow for the average number of years before this cohort retires, the future value could have resulted in 6.4 million 15-year retirement annuities paying $37,500 per year.
<p><ul>
<li><b>The growth of household wealth has been cut.</b> The 1993 legislation will have reduced the growth of household net wealth by $111 billion from between 1993 and 1996. The WUMM model defines net household wealth as a sum of personal savings, the purchase of automobiles and other durables, the existing household stock of durable goods and personal capital gains.
</ul><p>
<b><li>The reduction in the deficit attributable to the 1993 plan has been small. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The President maintains that taxes had to be raised in 1993 to reduce mounting federal debt.<sup>31</sup>  He now points to a fall in the deficit as justification for the 1993 legislation. But the Heritage analysis indicates that the weak economy produced by the tax hike will have generated far less new revenue, and thus less deficit reduction, than the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) had predicted for FY 1994 through the end of FY 1996. On the other hand, the analysis indicates that the modest amount of savings predicted from the spending cuts will materialize. These findings suggest that if OBRA-93 had enacted few or no tax increases to slow the economy, but more spending cuts, the deficit would be far less today than it is.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1993, CBO predicted that OBRA-93 would lower the cumulative deficits between FY 1994 and FY 1996 by $171 billion. Some $50 billion of these savings -- 29 percent of the total -- was to come from spending cuts, including $17 billion in net interest savings and asset sale proceeds. The remaining $121 billion in deficit reduction -- 70 percent of the total -- was to come from the new revenues generated by the increase in tax rates.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage analysis indicates that OBRA-93 will have produced just 74 percent of the deficit reduction CBO had estimated, or a total of $127 billion.<sup>32</sup>  This, however, does not tell the whole story. While the spending cuts will have produced slightly more savings than CBO predicted, $52 billion (excluding asset sale proceeds), accounting for 41 percent of the overall deficit reduction achieved,<sup>33</sup> the tax increase accounts for roughly 54 percent of the total, having delivered far less new revenue than was promised. 
<p><ul>
<li>The Heritage analysis shows that the tax increase will have produced just $68 billion in actual deficit reduction between FY 1994 and the end of FY 1996, just 56 cents of actual deficit reduction for every new dollar CBO predicted would be generated.
<p>
<li>However, excluding the roughly $16 billion in new revenues generated by the increase in the motor fuels tax, the analysis shows that the increase in personal and corporate tax rates produced only 49 percent of the new revenues CBO predicted would be generated.
<p>
<li>Thus, comparing the actual amount of deficit reduction produced by the 1993 tax hike between 1994 and 1996, with the 1.2 million potential new jobs lost, it can be said that the 1993 tax increase will have meant the loss of over 17,600 new jobs for every $1 billion it achieved in deficit reduction.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage analysis of the near-term consequences of the 1993 tax increase largely confirms the results of a recent study by noted Harvard University economist Martin Feldstein and Daniel Feenberg, an economist at the National Bureau of Economic Research. Their analysis of the impact of the 1993 tax increase on individual behavior shows that the higher tax rates placed on upper-income taxpayers encouraged these individuals to change their economic behavior and, thus, report lower taxable income. As a result, in the first year it took effect, the 1993 tax rate increase raised just 45 percent of the "revenue that would have been collected if taxpayers had not changed their behavior."<sup>34</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, Feldstein and Feenberg discovered that the 1993 tax hike caused considerable inefficiencies in the economy, what economists call "deadweight losses."  "This means that for every dollar of additional revenue collected by the government as a result of the higher tax rates, taxpayers experience a decline in their well-being equivalent to three dollars as a result of the induced changes in work, in the form of compensation, and in tax deductible expenditures."<sup>35</sup>  In other words, conclude Feldstein and Feenberg, "the structure of the 1993 tax increase thus made it a very inefficient way of increasing revenue."<sup>36</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This analysis so far has examined what might be called the short-term effects of the 1993 package. The current debate is about these short term effects, with the White House claiming benefits to today's economy. But for there to be a complete verdict on the 1993 tax and budget plan, one needs to project into the future, to explore whether the short-term effects analyzed above are merely a prelude to future growth.
</ol><p>
<b>THE LONG-TERM PICTURE</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To estimate the longer-run future effects of the 1993 plan, Heritage analysts used the WUMM model to extend the simulation of potential economic performance without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget deal through 2004. The results of this simulation were then compared with the baseline economic projections -- under current law and including the 1993 tax increase and budget deal -- produced by the owners of the WUMM model in December 1995. The comparison shows that nearly every major economic indicator is projected to be weaker under current law than would have been possible without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget act between now and 2004. Specifically, the Heritage analysis concludes: 
<p><ul>
<li><a href="bg1078c4.gif">Gross domestic product</a> is projected to be lower in each year. In 2004 alone, GDP is projected to be $122.5 billion lower in today's dollars than would have been possible without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
<p>
<li>Real personal disposable income is projected to be lower each year. In 2004 alone, Americans will see $142 billion less in disposable income than would be possible without the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
<p>
<li>Employment is projected to be less in every year. By 2004, 1.5 million fewer jobs will be created because of the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While there is good news in the economy, such as low interest rates, low inflation, 8 million new jobs, and lower federal deficits, many workers and their families feel that the recovery is anemic as far as they are concerned. The Clinton Administration is taking credit for good economic news and asserts that the news is a justification of its economic policies; specifically, the 1993 budget deal, which included the largest tax increase in history.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The evidence does not support the Administration's claim that the 1993 budget plan triggered stronger economic growth. On the contrary, the critics of the 1993 legislation appear to be correct that because of it Americans are caught in what some refer to as the "Clinton Crunch," the dual effect of declining real wages combined with higher taxes. The analysis by Heritage Foundation economists, using the WUMM model, indicates that OBRA-93 has had a damaging impact on the nation's economy. Removing the effects of OBRA-93 in an econometric simulation shows that the economy would have been performing better today had Congress not enacted the legislation. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, President Clinton is right to point to the 1993 budget deal as creating today's economic climate. But rather than create a better climate, the legislation has cast a dark shadow over the economy.

<p>
<b>Notes on the Simulation</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The simulation of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93) was developed using the Washington University Macroeconomic Model of the United States economy. The baseline is that produced by the model in December 1995. Only those variables in the model that reflect federal tax and spending policies were modified to create the simulation. Both the baseline case and the simulation incorporated the model's Federal Reserve reaction function. Specifically, Heritage economists made the following decisions regarding tax and spending data inputted into the model for the simulation:<sup>37</sup>
<p><ul>
<li><b>Tax Changes</b> -- Most changes in tax policy were initiated in the first quarter of 1993 to account for the retroactive nature of the tax increases included in OBRA-93. 
<p>
1. The maximum federal corporate tax rate was restored to its "pre-OBRA-93" level to account for the one percentage point rate increase included in OBRA-93.
<p>
2. The statutory depreciation period for nonresidential structures was restored to its "pre-OBRA-93" level of 31.5 years. The corporate capital consumption allowance, as a percentage of total capital consumption allowance, was increased to accommodate the shorter depreciation periods within the simulation.
<p>
3. The federal statutory income-weighted marginal tax rates on wages, dividends, and interest were restored to their "pre-OBRA-93" levels.
<p>
4. The average federal personal tax rate was adjusted to account for lower marginal tax rates within the simulation compared to actual levels.
<p>
5. The federal statutory income-weighted marginal Social Security tax rate on wages and salaries was re-set to its "pre-OBRA-93" level.
<p>
6. Federal collections from social insurance taxes were adjusted to account for the repeal of the cap on earnings subject to the Medicare tax.
<p>
7. Federal collections from indirect business taxes were adjusted for the extension and increase of the motor fuels tax account.
<p>
8. Federal collections from business taxes were adjusted to account for non-rate changes in the business income tax code.
<p>

<li><b>Mandatory Spending Changes </b>
<p>
1. The actual spending level for <b>Medicare</b> was increased for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes would save -- a total of $55.8 billion between 1994 and 1998. 
<p>
2. The actual spending level for <b>Medicaid</b> transfers was increased for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes would save -- a total of $7.1 billion between 1994 and 1998.
<p>
3. The actual spending level for personal transfers was adjusted for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes in <b>federal employee retirement and health benefits, veteran benefits</b>, and the <b>Earned Income Tax Credit</b> would create -- a net total of $6.7 billion of increased spending between 1994 and 1998. The increased spending for the Earned Income Tax Credit more than offset the savings from reforming federal employee retirement and health benefits, and veterans benefits. Therefore, the simulation actually calls for less spending on personal transfers than actually occurred during the past three years.
<p>
4. The actual spending level for other grants-in-aid was adjusted for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes in <b>federal farm programs</b>, the <b>food stamp program</b>, and <b>"other" mandatory programs</b> would save -- a net total of $7.2 billion between 1994 and 1998.
<p>
5.  The proceeds from FCC electromagnetic spectrum auctions and the savings from changes in federal family education loans were added to the unified deficit but not included in the NIPA-based spending accounts.
<p>
<li><b>Discretionary Spending Changes</b> -- The actual spending levels for <b>non-defense purchases, defense purchases, and federal grants</b> to state and local governments were adjusted for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes in discretionary spending would save -- a total of $68.5 billion between 1994 and 1998. This was evenly distributed among the three separate accounts.
<p>
<li><b>Spending Projections FY 1999 - FY 2004</b> -- CBO September 1993 estimates extended through FY 1998. For fiscal years 1999 through 2004, the underlying growth rates were assumed.
</ul><P>

<b>Other Technical Notes</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Personal Savings</b> -- The Heritage analysis concludes, among other things, that the tax policy changes of 1993 undercut personal savings by $138 billion. The estimates of long-term consumption effects were calculated as follows. The foregone personal savings were distributed across an array of seven age groupings by the percentage of people that fall in each grouping. This array consists of population estimates made by the U.S. Bureau of the Census for 1995.<sup>38</sup> 
<p>
<li>For those people 18 years old or less, the distributed personal savings were allowed to grow until their 18th year at a compounded rate of 5 percent. The sum of this compounding ($432 billion) was divided by $14,000 to arrive at the estimate of 7 million people who could pay for four years of state university education. 
<p>
<li>For those people between the ages of 18 and 35, the distributed personal savings were allowed to grow at a compounded annual rate of 5 percent until their 35th birthday. The sum of this compounding ($335 billion) was divided by $20,000 to arrive at the estimate of 17 million home sales that might be effected by potential home purchasers having $20,000 for a down payment and other home-buying costs. 
<p>
<li>For those people between the ages of 35 and 65, the distributed savings were allowed to grow at a compounded annual rate of 5 percent until their 65th birthday. The sum of this compounding was $3.6 trillion. To this sum was added the amount of distributed personal savings for people above age 65. It was assumed that this amount is consumed as it is received. Therefore, the total amount available for retirement was $3.6 trillion. This $3.6 trillion estimate was divided by $37,500 (an estimate of annual living costs at retirement for the cohort aged 35 and above) to arrive at the estimate of 6.4 million 15-year retirement annuities.

<li>Most of the change in earnings can be accounted for by the loss in firm-size wage premiums as workers have moved from larger to smaller firms.

<li>The data comparisons made in this section refer to similar points in time during these four expansions.  For example, average employment growth from March 1991 to the present (59 months) is compared with the average employment growth from February 1961 to December 1965 (59 months), from March 1975 to January 1980, and from November 1982 to October 1987.<p>

<li>There are limits to the historical changes economists can make in structural macroeconomic models.  Clearly the major limitation is the time period.  While economies rarely experience major changes in the span of a few years, structural stability is far less likely over longer time periods.  The six years of changes in variables in the WUMM model needed to measure the 1990 tax increase would have stretched prudent econometric practice to its limits.  A number of prominent macroeconomists have written on the deleterious effects of the 1990 budget deal.  For a summary of these viewpoints, see Daniel J.  Mitchell, "The Impact of Higher Taxes:  More Spending, Economic Stagnation, Fewer Jobs, and Higher Deficits," Heritage Foundation <I>Backgrounder</I> No.  925, February 10, 1993, and Daniel J.  Mitchell, "Why Higher Tax Rates on Income Will Slow Growth, Cost Jobs," Heritage Foundation <I>Backgrounder</I> No.  942, May 25, 1993.<P>
<li>Congressional Budget Office, <I>The Economic and Budget Outlook:  An Update</I> (Washington, D.C.:  U.S.  Government Printing Office, 1993), Table 2-2, p.  29.<p>
<li>This estimate is derived from a statistical analysis of the relationship between the number of new business incorporations and real GDP over the period 1959-1994.  Overall a decrease in GDP of $1 billion was found to be associated with a decrease in the number of new business incorporations by an average of 194.957 over this period.  (The estimate had an R-squared of .92748, a standard error of 9.35, and a t-statistic of 20.852.) Multiplying this figure by the $208 billion lost from GDP over 1993-96 (as a result of the Clinton tax increase) gave an estimate of 40,600 fewer new businesses.  Figures for GDP and business formation came from the 1995 and the 1996 <I>Economic Report of the President</I> (Washington, D.C.:  U.S.  Government Printing Office, 1996), Tables B-2 and B-92, respectively, pp.  282, 385.   <P>
<li>The estimate of lost potential employment results from increases in taxes on the wages and salaries of upper income Americans, on the income of corporations, and on capital, an effect that stems from lengthening the period of depreciation on capital goods as well as taxing interest, dividends, and capital gains at higher rates.  Such tax increases reduce capital formation and promote consumption.  By increasing both the cost of capital and the cost of additional labor, the rate of business expansion and formation falls below potential which, in turn, reduces the potential growth of employment.<p>
<li>Most labor economists view tax increases as being equivalent to wage decreases, but they hold sharply divergent views about the degree of change in employment that results from a change in the tax rate on labor income.  See Mark Killingsworth, <I>Labor Supply</I> (New York:  Cambridge University Press, 1983), Chapter 6, esp.  pp.  356-360.  This variation in the amount of labor that is supplied as the wage level changes is called the "wage or income supply elasticity of labor."  More specifically, the supply elasticity of labor is a measurement of the percentage change in the amount of labor that is supplied from a one percent change in the compensation of labor.  The professional literature contains estimates of the labor supply elasticity that range from.  12 to.  37 percent for every one percent change in total labor income (which become negatively signed when analyzing the effect of taxes on labor supply).  See Killingsworth, <I>Labor Supply</I>, pp.  119-125, Table 3.2 to 3.5.  Also see comparable variation in the demand elasticities for labor in Daniel S.  Hamermesh, <I>Labor Demand</I> (Princeton, N.  J.:  Princeton University Press, 1993), Table 7.5.  The elasticity of labor supply used in the Washington University Macro Model is 0.29 percent and lies within the midrange of the estimates contained in this literature.<P>

It should be noted here, however, that the foregone savings is distributed to three different age groupings that each save for only one of the three purchases.  Allowing only one purchase for each group significantly simplified an otherwise complicated problem.  The group that is saving for education (those people under age 18) is not saving for a home purchase.  The group that is saving for a home purchase (aged 18 through 35) is not saving for retirement.  And the group saving for retirement (age 35 and above) is saving only for retirement.<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The 1996 presidential campaign has rekindled the debate over tax reductions. Among the proposals being considered are an across-the-board reduction in tax rates, the repeal of rate increases imposed in 1990 and 1993, the deductibility of payroll taxes, and a modified flat tax. But regardless of the particular features of each change under consideration, the argument is the same. Proponents argue that lower tax rates will spur economic growth by reducing the penalty on working, saving, and investing. Opponents disagree, claiming that the economy is doing fine and that tax rate reductions, if enacted, will help the rich disproportionately while widening the deficit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Fortunately, there is a way to judge the desirability of lower tax rates. The United States has had three major episodes of tax rate reductions -- the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s. By looking at how the economy performed during these periods, and by examining what happened to the deficit and the degree to which different income classes were affected, it is possible to gain useful evidence about the desirability of tax rate reductions today.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The evidence provides strong support for those who believe the economy is weak and favor reductions in tax rates. Recent history is especially compelling. Tax rate increases in 1990 and 1993 boosted the top rate to 39.6 percent (and over 42 percent including the Medicare payroll tax). This means a 50 percent increase in the tax burden on work, saving, investment, and entrepreneurship when compared with the 28 percent rate in effect when Ronald Reagan left office. The effect has been dismal:
<p><ul>
<li> During the post-Reagan era, the economy has experienced its worst seven-year performance since the end of World War II.
<p>
<li> Real median family income, the best measure of living standards for the average American, has fallen by more than $2,000 since Reagan left office.
<p>
<li> Assuming there is no change in policy, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that economic growth for the next ten years will average less than 2.1 percent annually.<sup>1</sup>  This is well below the post-World War II average of 3.2 percent.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The economy's sub-standard performance in recent years should come as no surprise. As seen below, major changes in tax policy inevitably affect growth.
<p><ul>
<li>Across-the-board tax rate reductions in the 1920s reduced the top rate from 71 percent to 24 percent. The economy boomed, growing by 59 percent between 1921 and 1929.
<p>
<li> In 1930, Herbert Hoover raised tax rates from 25 percent to a maximum of 63 percent, and Franklin Roosevelt boosted them to 79 percent later in the decade. The 1930s, to put it mildly, are not remembered as one of the American economy's better decades.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
<li> Across-the-board tax rate reductions introduced by President John F. Kennedy reduced the top rate from 91 percent to 70 percent. These lower rates, along with substantially lower taxes on savings and investment, are associated with the longest economic expansion in American history.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
<li> The Johnson surtax, enacted in 1968 during the administration of President Lyndon Johnson, combined with the inflation-induced bracket creep of the 1970s (subjecting taxpayers to higher rates even though their real incomes had not changed), resulted in a decade of stagflation.
<p>
<li> Reagan's across-the-board tax cuts ushered in America's longest peacetime expansion, helping to create 20 million new jobs and pushing incomes and living standards to record highs.
<p>
<li> The tax rate increases imposed under George Bush and Bill Clinton, as outlined below, are associated with the slowest growing economy in 50 years and a decline of more than $2,000 in the average family's income.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


If legislators want to unleash stronger growth and more prosperity, the best tax policy would be the flat tax. Under that proposal, all three major problems of the current tax code -- high rates, anti-capital bias, and complexity -- would be minimized. To the extent that politicians are reluctant to adopt a flat tax, however, any change that moved in the right direction would be helpful. If history is any guide, any tax rate reduction, whether a 15 percent across-the-board cut, a repeal of the Bush and Clinton tax hikes, or some other reform, would boost the economy and raise living standards.
<p>
<b>LOOKING AT CASE HISTORIES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The effect of tax rates on economic activity should not be overstated. The economy, after all, can be affected significantly by trade policy, regulatory policy, monetary policy, and many other government actions. Even within the context of fiscal policy, tax rates are not the only critical issue. Both the level of government spending and where that money goes are very important. And even when looking only at tax policy, tax rates are just one piece of the puzzle. If certain types of income are subject to multiple layers of tax, as occurs in the current system, that problem cannot be solved by low rates. Similarly, a tax system with needless levels of complexity will impose heavy costs on the productive sector of the economy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Keeping all these caveats in mind, there nonetheless is a distinct pattern throughout American history: Simply stated, when tax rates are reduced, the economy prospers, tax revenues grow, and lower-income citizens bear a lower share of the tax burden. Conversely, periods of higher tax rates are associated with subpar economic performance and stagnant tax revenues.
<P>
<b>The 1920s</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under the leadership of Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon during the Administrations of Presidents Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge, tax rates were slashed from the confiscatory levels they had reached in World War I. The Revenue Acts of 1921, 1924, and 1926 reduced the top rate from 73 percent to 25 percent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Spurred in part by lower tax rates, the economy expanded dramatically. In real terms, the economy grew 59 percent between 1921 and 1929, and annual economic growth averaged more than 6 percent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Notwithstanding (or perhaps because of) the dramatic reduction in tax rates, personal income tax revenues increased substantially during the 1920s, rising from $719 million in 1921 to $1,160 million in 1928, an increase of more than 61 percent (this was a period of no inflation).<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The share of the tax burden borne by the rich rose dramatically. As seen in <a href="bg1086c5.gif">Chart 5</a>, taxes paid by the rich (those making $50,000 and up in those days) climbed from 44.2 percent of the total tax burden in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This surge in revenue was no surprise to Mellon:
<p><blockquote>
	The history of taxation shows that taxes which are inherently excessive are not paid. The high rates inevitably put pressure upon the taxpayer to withdraw his capital from productive business and invest it in tax-exempt securities or to find other lawful methods of avoiding the realization of taxable income. The result is that the sources of taxation are drying up; wealth is failing to carry its share of the tax burden; and capital is being diverted into channels which yield neither revenue to the Government nor profit to the people.<sup>5</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>The 1960s</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Kennedy proposed a series of tax rate reductions in 1963 that resulted in legislation the following year dropping the top rate from 91 percent in 1963 to 70 percent by 1965.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Kennedy tax cuts helped trigger the longest economic expansion in America's history. Between 1961 and 1968, the inflation-adjusted economy expanded by more than 42 percent. On a yearly basis, economic growth averaged more than 5 percent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Tax revenues grew strongly, rising by 62 percent between 1961 and 1968. Adjusted for inflation, they rose by one-third.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Just as in the 1920s, the share of the income tax burden borne by the rich increased. Tax collections from those making over $50,000 per year climbed by 57 percent between 1963 and 1966, while tax collections from those earning below $50,000 rose 11 percent. As a result, the rich saw their portion of the income tax burden climb from 11.6 percent to 15.1 percent.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to President Kennedy:
<p><blockquote>
	Our true choice is not between tax reduction, on the one hand, and the avoidance of large Federal deficits on the other. It is increasingly clear that no matter what party is in power, so long as our national security needs keep rising, an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenues to balance our budget just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits. Surely the lesson of the last decade is that budget deficits are not caused by wild-eyed spenders but by slow economic growth and periodic recessions and any new recession would break all deficit records. In short, it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now.<sup>8</sup>

</blockquote>
<p>
<b>The 1980s</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Reagan presided over two major pieces of tax legislation which together reduced the top tax rate from 70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent by 1988.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The economic effects of the Reagan tax cuts were dramatic. When Reagan took office in 1981, the economy was being choked by high inflation and was in the middle of a double-dip recession (1980 and 1982). The tax cuts helped pull the economy out of the doldrums and ushered in the longest period of peacetime economic growth in America's history. During the seven-year Reagan boom, economic growth averaged almost 4 percent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Critics charge that the tax cuts caused higher deficits, but they misread the evidence. The Reagan tax cut, though approved in 1981, was phased in over several years. As a result, bracket creep (indexing was not implemented until 1985) and payroll tax increases completely swamped Reagan's 1.25 percent tax cut in 1981 and effectively canceled out the portion of the tax cut which went into effect in 1982. The economy received an unambiguous tax cut only as of January 1983. Thereafter, personal income tax revenues climbed dramatically, increasing by more than 54 percent by 1989 (28 percent after adjusting for inflation).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Contrary to conventional wisdom, it was the "rich" who paid the additional taxes. The share of income taxes paid by the top 10 percent of earners jumped significantly, climbing from 48.0 percent in 1981 to 57.2 percent in 1988. The top 1 percent saw their share of the income tax bill climb even more dramatically, from 17.6 percent in 1981 to 27.5 percent in 1988.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of the chief architects of the Reagan tax cuts was then-U.S. Representative <a href="/heritage/staff/kemp.htm">Jack Kemp</a> (R-NY). According to Kemp:
<p><blockquote>
	At some point, additional taxes so discourage the activity being taxed, such as working or investing, that they yield less revenue rather than more. There are, after all, two rates that yield the same amount of revenue: high tax rates on low production, or low rates on high production.<sup>10</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>THE LESSONS
<p>
1) Lower tax rates do not mean less tax revenue.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The tax cuts of the 1920s:</b> Personal income tax revenues increased substantially during the 1920s, despite the reduction in rates. Revenues rose from $719 million in 1921 to $1164 million in 1928, an increase of more than 61 percent (this was a period of virtually no inflation).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Kennedy tax cuts:</b> Tax revenues climbed from $94 billion in 1961 to $153 billion in 1968, an increase of 62 percent (33 percent after adjusting for inflation).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Reagan tax cuts:</b> Total tax revenues climbed by 99.4 percent during the 1980s, and the results are even more impressive when looking at what happened to personal income tax revenues. Once the economy received an unambiguous tax cut in January 1983, income tax revenues climbed dramatically, increasing by more than 54 percent by 1989 (28 percent after adjusting for inflation).
<p>
<b>2) The rich pay more when incentives to hide income are reduced.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The tax cuts of the 1920s:</b> The share of the tax burden paid by the rich rose dramatically as tax rates were reduced. The share of the tax burden borne by the rich (those making $50,000 and up in those days) climbed from 44.2 percent in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Kennedy tax cuts:</b> Just as happened in the 1920s, the share of the income tax burden borne by the rich increased following the tax cuts. Tax collections from those making over $50,000 per year climbed by 57 percent between 1963 and 1966, while tax collections from those earning below $50,000 rose 11 percent. As a result, the rich saw their portion of the income tax burden climb from 11.6 percent to 15.1 percent.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Reagan tax cuts:</b> The share of income taxes paid by the top 10 percent of earners jumped significantly, climbing from 48.0 percent in 1981 to 57.2 percent in 1988. The top 1 percent saw their share of the income tax bill climb even more dramatically, from 17.6 percent in 1981 to 27.5 percent in 1988.<sup>13</sup>

<p>

<b>THE 1990S: IGNORING THE LESSONS OF THE PAST</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unlike reductions in tax rates, increases in tax rates have a history of failure. The Hoover and Roosevelt tax increases of the 1930s certainly contributed to the dismal economy during the Great Depression. Tax revenues fell during much of the period, and the deficit increased. And as <a href="bg1086c11.gif">Chart 11</a> shows, the high tax rates of the 1950s resulted in sluggish revenue growth. Ignoring history, both Democrats and Republicans at the time argued that tax rates reaching over 90 percent could not be cut for fear of revenue loss. Moreover, the 1970s, which began with the Johnson surtax and later were hit by bracket creep, triggered the tax revolt and the Reagan tax cuts.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps more than any other decade, however, the 1990s make the best argument against higher tax rates. In both 1990 and 1993, the economy was subjected to record tax increases, the ostensible purpose of which was to raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit. As <a href="bg1086c12.gif">Chart 12</a> illustrates, however, these increases backfired. Total tax revenue, as a percent of economic output, is expected to be lower this year than it was when Reagan left office.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Significantly, the modest decline in revenues relative to gross domestic product (GDP) is due to the slower growth in personal income tax revenues. As shown in <a href="bg1086c12.gif">Chart 12</a>, individual income tax revenues totaled 8.6 percent of economic output in 1989. By 1996 -- two large tax increases later -- individual income tax revenues had fallen to 8.5 percent of economic output. In other words, the tax that was increased the most accounts for the drop in tax revenue as a share of national output.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
High tax rates are bad for the economy. High tax rates that increase the deficit by reducing the growth of tax revenue are even worse. What makes recent history especially tragic is that the economic and budgetary losses could have been avoided if Bush and Clinton had simply kept Reagan's policies in place. In 1989, the Congressional Budget Office projected that the budget deficit, which then was $152 billion, would continue to fall for the next five years assuming no change in Reagan's policies. As of 1995 -- again, two large tax increases later -- the budget deficit had risen to $164 billion, and it is projected by the CBO to reach more than $400 billion by 2006 if Clinton's policies are left in place.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The dismal budget numbers, however, tell only part of the story. The economy has been the real victim of higher tax rates. As <a href="bg1086c13.gif">Chart 13</a> shows, the post-Reagan era has seen the slowest growth of any seven-year period since the end of World War II. As discussed earlier, this slow growth has left people with more than $2,000 less income when inflation is taken into account. The biggest losers have been the poor. As Chart 14 illustrates, income for the bottom 20 percent has fallen the most during the Bush/Clinton era. The politicians who imposed the higher taxes, needless to say, argued that the rich would be the ones to suffer.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The economy is limping, incomes have been falling, tax revenues are stagnant, and it is projected that the deficit will more than double in the next ten years. This is the legacy of higher tax rates and a tax code that punishes working, saving, and investing. History shows clearly that the way to reverse this trend is to cut tax rates. Legislation to reduce rates would do this. Better still, Congress should scrap the current system as quickly as possible and replace it with a flat tax that treats all taxpayers equally and minimizes the burden on productive behavior.

<h3>WHO ARE YOU, COMRADE ZYUGANOV?</h3>

<a href="/heritage/staff/volk.htm">Evguenii Volk</a>, Ph.D.<br>

<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 108<br>
June 6, 1996<br>
<P><hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to recent polls in Russia, Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov ranks first among the Russian presidential candidates. President Boris Yeltsin, ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, social democrat Grigory Yavlinski, retired general Alexander Lebed, former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, and six other candidates are also competing for Russia's top job. On June 16, Zyuganov has a good chance of receiving a plurality of the vote -- roughly 30 percent. This percentage could allow him to participate in a runoff election four weeks later against the other highest vote-getter (most likely President Yeltsin).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov's constituency consists largely of those who have lost out during Russia's progress toward a free-market economy and democracy. These people -- primarily the elderly, the unemployed, and unskilled workers who lack higher education -- are motivated not so much by communist ideology as by the hardships of day-to-day living and disappointment in the reform process. It is difficult to convince them that the communist pledges of a welfare state cannot be implemented, and that the social safety net promised by Zyuganov will require funds that are not available. The only way to raise these funds would be through a major increase in the money supply, which also would lead to hyper-inflation and even more economic hardship.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov claims to be the leader of a broad "national-patriotic" coalition and is supported by non-communist nationalist figures, such as influential Duma deputies Sergei Baburin and Alexei Podberezkin. One of the chief ideologists of Russian imperialism and militarism, Alexander Prokhanov, is among his staunchest allies.<sup>1</sup>  His political platform is a bizarre mixture of populist, communist, and Russian nationalist rhetoric that clearly implies a "communist revenge" -- turning the clock back to government ownership of Russia's industrial assets, aggressive regulation of the economy by the central government, fixed prices and wages, rationing and shortages of consumer goods, the stifling of basic freedoms, and strict control over the mass media, in addition to a new military buildup and renewed confrontation with the West. It is highly doubtful that such objectives can be achieved peacefully.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If Zyuganov wins the presidential election, the potential for violence, both internally (as the communists move to crush the opposition) and externally (as Russia takes a more aggressive stance toward its neighbors and the West), will increase. The resulting destabilization could have dramatic ramifications both for Russian and U.S. vital interests. As president of Russia, Zyuganov not only would lead his country down the road of more confrontation with the U.S. and the West, but might even exaggerate his differences with the West to mobilize popular support and resentment at home.

<p>
<b>WHO ARE YOU, DR. ZYUGANOV?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On June 26, 1996, Zyuganov will be 52 years old. He was born in the village of Mymrino in the Central Russian region of Oryol, about 200 miles southwest of Moscow. The son of rural school teachers, he enjoyed higher social status, better living standards, and a richer intellectual environment than the other village children; but the post-collectivization and post-World War II hardships also affected his childhood. He graduated with honors from high school at age 17 and immediately began teaching. Zyuganov wed one of his pupils and now has two married children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1962, Zyuganov became a student at the physics and mathematics department of the local teachers college in Oryol. Less than a year later, while still a freshman, he was drafted into the army. Zyuganov served two years in a special nuclear and chemical reconnaissance unit of the Soviet troops stationed in East Germany and was sent to perform decontamination work in the South Urals after a major nuclear catastrophe in the late 1950s (a disaster hushed up by the Soviet authorities for decades). He apparently was exposed to nuclear radiation while serving in this unit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov proceeded along the typical Soviet <I>nomenklatura</I> career path. At the age of 21, while still serving in the army, he joined the Communist Party (CPSU). The fact that he was drafted into the party at such a young age indicates that he was very disciplined, politically astute and loyal, on good terms with his superiors, and sufficiently pragmatic to anticipate the benefits of early Communist Party affiliation. After resuming his studies at the college, he became a Young Communist League (Komsomol) activist and quickly went on to become a full-time functionary heading the Oryol city and regional committee. In 1974, he became a regional Communist Party deputy chief, responsible for day-to-day running of the region and for ideological questions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1978, he began postgraduate work at the prestigious Academy of Social Sciences under the Communist Party Central Committee, then the center of political training for top Communist Party <I>apparatchiks</I>. Recommendations from powerful superiors were needed to enter. He earned a Candidate (Ph.D.) at the Academy and 14 years later became a Doctor of Science in Philosophy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Completing the postgraduate course at the Academy of Social Sciences boosted his party career and allowed him to network with powerful Central Committee staff members. Soon Zyuganov was transferred to Moscow to become a bureaucrat in the CPSU Central Committee's omnipotent Propaganda Department (later renamed the Ideological Department). The Propaganda Department monitored and shaped the nation's communist indoctrination and exercised strict ideological control over all aspects of life in the USSR. In 1990, toward the end of his party career, Zyuganov was promoted to the position of deputy head of the Propaganda Department, but the fall of the Soviet Union prevented him from becoming one of the top decision makers. Moreover, the department lost influence during the perestroika years under Mikhail Gorbachev. These were not easy times for Gennady Zyuganov. He had to maneuver between his direct superior, Secretary for Ideology of the Central Committee Alexander N. Yakovlev -- the liberal "architect of perestroika" -- and hard-line Politburo Secretary Yegor K. Ligachev, who opposed Gorbachev's policies of glasnost.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov made his final choice in favor of the hard-line communists in 1990 when he joined the newly established Communist Party of the Russian Federation, which brought together all of Gorbachev's militant opponents. Zyuganov was immediately elected to the new party governing bodies and became one of the chief ideologists of the anti-democratic and anti-reform forces in Russia, working to consolidate them under his own leadership within the "national patriotic movement," a motley coalition of anti-Western, anti-reform, and anti-Semitic organizations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov co-authored the infamous "Word to the People" appeal, a declaration which called for reversing reforms, preserving the Soviet Union, and putting down the independence movements in the republics. Published in July of 1991 in the hard-line media  -- for example, in such newspapers as <I>Pravda, Segodnya</I>, and <I>Sovetskaya Rossiya</I> -- this declaration became an ideological basis for the August 1991 abortive coup, which was an attempt to restore totalitarianism in Russia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What Zyuganov wrote in words, he did not implement in practice, being personally either cautious or cowardly. His behavior during and after the 1991 coup significantly tainted his political image among the communists. Despite his authorship of the "Word to the People," he neither actively supported the attempt nor opposed the subsequent banning of communist parties. In fact, the ban scared Zyuganov so much that he chose to lie low for a time.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The unemployed Zyuganov found asylum with the "Russian-American University" (RAU-Corporation),<sup>2</sup>  a center which became a rallying point for "national-patriotic" forces favoring a return to Russia's lost superpower status and "special way of development."  The U.S. Department of State denounced the RAU, calling it a CPSU and KGB front organization, and recommended that American government and private agencies refrain from contacts with it.<sup>3</sup>  Zyuganov plunged into the study of nationalist rhetoric. Alexander Barkashov, leader of the neo-fascist "Russian National Unity" party, once admitted that he had guided Zyuganov in mastering such concepts as the "Russian Idea" and "the Revival of the National Identity."<sup>4</sup>  These are shorthand for Russia's special national mission, geopolitical domination, and supposed racial superiority.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The fact that no anti-communist purge took place after the 1991 coup attempt encouraged Zyuganov to resume his political activities. In 1992, he chaired such left-wing and ultranationalist organizations as the Council of Popular Patriotic Forces, the Duma of the Russian National Council, and the National Salvation Council, which vehemently opposed President Yeltsin's reform policies and called for his impeachment. He and his associates also filed a complaint in the Constitutional Court questioning the legitimacy of the presidential decree which had banned the Communist Party. Zyuganov and his comrades won, and the Russian Communist Party's legal status was restored in 1993. Now successful, he was elected Chairman of the Party's Central Executive Committee in February 1993.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1993, Zyuganov helped exacerbate the confrontation between Yeltsin and the "red-brown" opposition which had concentrated in the Russian Supreme Soviet, the old Russian parliament held over from the days of the Soviet Union. The conflict reached a tragic climax in October 1993 with fierce clashes between pro-government forces and opposing rebel fighters in Moscow's streets as the seat of the Russian parliament (the White House) was shelled and stormed by the army. However, Zyuganov avoided direct participation in this mutiny as well, and even condemned the appeal made by its leaders for a general strike. By standing aloof, Zyuganov managed to avoid trouble and run for the State Duma (new parliament) in the December 12, 1993, elections. Other militant opposition leaders had been banned from these elections. Curiously, Zyuganov ran while decrying the illegitimacy of the new Duma, condemning what he called the "presidential coup" which had dissolved the Supreme Soviet.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Architect of the Communist Comeback.</b> The December 1993 election to the first State Duma of Russia put Zyuganov in the leadership position within the Duma's third-largest faction, after reformist Yegor Gaidar's "Russia's Choice" and Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultranationalist Liberal Democrats. For the next three years, as he continued his unequivocal and belligerent criticism of the government, his popularity continued to rise. On December 17, 1995, in the second Duma elections, Zyuganov's Communist Party received 22 percent of the votes in the Duma. He was now the leader of its largest faction.
<P>
<b>THE WORLD ACCORDING TO COMRADE ZYUGANOV</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov's newly emerged philosophy has little to do with traditional Marxist-Leninist communism. Rather, it is a concoction of statist, nationalist, messianic, populist, and even religious Russian Orthodox slogans based on a profound mistrust of the West. Believing that the Western way of development can lead only to a historical dead end, Zyuganov proposes "a breakthrough to a new socio-economic system built on the great Russian cultural and historical heritage."<sup>5</sup>  However, he never specifies exactly what the elements of such a system would be and seems to ignore the fact that all attempts to achieve such a "breakthrough" under the Bolsheviks failed, generating disasters that exhausted Russia and resulted in the worse crisis the country had experienced since 1917.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov has no firsthand knowledge of the West and speaks no foreign languages, but his background, upbringing, and adult experiences have prejudiced him against what he calls "Western capitalism."  He is susceptible to anti-Western conspiracy theories that circulate regularly among Russian communists and nationalists. These speculations lay the blame for all Russia's current hardships at the feet of "American imperialism" and its mysterious "agents of influence" in Russia, as well as Jews and Freemasons. Zyuganov claimed in 1995, for example, that the Soviet Union was dismembered as the result of a U.S. National Security Council directive adopted by John F. Kennedy after the Cuban Missile Crisis. He also believes that the purportedly secret "memoranda #1, 2, 3" drafted for George Bush were part of this strategy to undo the Soviet Union. He says that he obtained this information from a classified CPSU Central Committee "Special File" (<I>Osobaya Papka</I>) containing top secret documents allegedly obtained through intelligence channels.<sup>6</sup>  However, Zyuganov's relatively low position in the CPSU Ideological Department would not have given him access to top secret documents intended only for Politburo members.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Over the past few years, Zyuganov's aides and speechwriters have tried to blunt his anti-Western image. He often has tried to incorporate Western examples or ideas to buttress his essentially anti-Western points of view. For example, Zyuganov argued in 1994 that "Some pro-American people in this country demand that we should move towards private ownership and a limited government. But the U.S. itself rejects such an approach. Back in 1933 Franklin D. Roosevelt summoned 200 leading American industrialists and told them: ' You should share 50 percent of your income with the government or we will have an October Revolution on our hands in no time.'"<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov's political campaign is based on inflaming political passions created by difficulties with the reform process. He is an alarmist who repeatedly predicts "disaster," "collapse," the "disintegration" of Russia, the extinction of the population, the humiliation of the nation, and total impoverishment.8  In his anti-Yeltsin rhetoric, he persistently condemns the government as "anti-people," carefully avoiding the fact that most of Russia's present difficulties emerged long before the reforms were started, under the communist regime of Mikhail Gorbachev. His favorite theme is that Russia is dying out, losing one million souls annually. He shuns statistics testifying to the contrary -- for example, that the mortality rate in 1995 dropped dramatically, while the birth rate grew for the first time since the 1970s.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>No Repentance.</b> Russian Communists like Zyuganov have never acknowledged or repented of the massive crimes committed against the nation by their predecessors. On the contrary, Zyuganov praises Vladimir Lenin, who personally ordered the shooting of thousands of innocent citizens, as "the most outstanding leader who unerringly felt Russia's deepest sorrows and needs."<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov does not praise Stalin outright, but he also allows no official communist criticism of him.11  He claims that there was no Soviet repression in the post-World War II period<sup>12</sup> and that there are more victims of repression in prisons today than under Stalin.<sup>13</sup>  Zyuganov once told the German magazine <I>Der Spiegel</I> that only two persons were arrested in his native village in the post-World War II period, and that both were hardened criminals. In fact, however, many in this village perished during Stalin's purges.<sup>14</sup>  Zyuganov even denies that former Soviet leaders like Leonid Brezhnev and Yuri Andropov ever sent political dissidents to the Gulag and special psychiatric prisons.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Zyuganov's Electoral Platform.</b> Zyuganov's electorate is stable and will vote for him under any circumstances. Thus, his main objective is to draw in those who are still undecided. Thus far, he has failed to produce a comprehensive program that encompasses all the views of the "broad national patriotic coalition," but his electoral platform, published in March 1996, undoubtedly is not as clear-cut as the secret Program Maximum (set of ultimate political goals) designed for internal communist consumption. While publicly Zyuganov makes no mention of nationalizing privatized property, the party program calls for "nationalization or confiscation of the property acquired against the law, national interests and the rights of working people."<sup>15</sup>  Presumably, the Communist Party will assume the prerogative of determining exactly what those interests and rights are. The newly published communist economic plan, unveiled in Moscow on May 28, calls for reversal of privatization which was executed "through violation of law" and allows meager private ownership limited to apartments, small garden plots, and small service businesses. The program, if implemented, would reverse the achievements of four years of economic reform and severely injure both Russian and Western private-sector interests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Indeed, Zyuganov does not offer Russia any sort of positive future. What he does pledge is a return to the communist past: economic regulation by the government, state monopoly of foreign trade, state ownership of land with no right to sell or buy property, government subsidies for bankrupt and uncompetitive industries, and restoration of the former Soviet Union.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov accuses the present government of destroying people's savings by devaluing the currency. To remedy this problem, he has promised to reimburse people for their losses. However, he overlooks the fact that most of the devaluation and confiscation of the currency occurred under the communist governments of former Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov and Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov in 1990-1991, before the reforms were launched. Nor do Zyuganov and the authors of his economic plan explain where they will get the money to restore the people's savings.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov's platform lacks clear and specific legislative proposals and policy guidelines. Instead, it contains numerous clichs: for example, "power should be returned to the people"; "children should get everything they are deprived of"; "women will rear children with confidence in their future"; and "talented people should be backed by the government."<sup>16</sup>  The communist election platform conceals rather than elucidates the policies Zyuganov would pursue if elected. Many in Moscow believe that Zyuganov himself does not know.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But some of his comrades believe they know. A group of communist Duma members in the spring of 1996 drafted a law "On Emergency Measures to Extricate Russia from the Crisis and to Ensure Its Socio-Economic Development."  This is blatant anti-reform manifesto envisages:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Restoration</b> of the government central planning system under a reestablished committee (GosPlan);<p>

<li><b>  Review</b> all legislation on privatization (with a view to stopping or reversing all privatization);<p>

<li><b>  Restoration</b> of government ministries to manage industries;
<p>
<li><b>  Regulation</b> of wholesale and retail prices;<p>
<li><b>  High protectionist</b> tariffs on imports;<P>
<li><b>  Increased</b> taxation;
<p>
<li><b>  Modernization</b> of Russia's defense industries and increased manufacture of armaments;<P>
<li><b>  Massive government subsidies</b> for the agricultural sector; and
<p>
<li><b>  Censorship</b> of the mass media.<sup>17</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The new communist economic plan issued for public consumption before the elections is a watered-down version of this legislation. Deeply rooted in anti-Western and anti-market ideology, the plan promises retreat from market reforms, the imposition of protectionism, and greatly increased government spending for industrial and agricultural subsidies and a social safety net.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Another communist idea is the restoration of the USSR, which under present circumstances would mean an attempt to rebuild a Russian empire hostile to its neighbors, both near and far. On March 15, 1996, communists in the Duma denounced the 1991 Belovezh agreement on the dismantling of the USSR. This move has caused great concern on the part of Russia's neighbors and other Western countries.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Appearing to Conciliate the West.</b> Zyuganov realizes that if he becomes president, he will still be dependent on Western loans and investments to keep the Russian economy afloat. Thus, particularly when addressing a Western audience, he does his utmost to mask his real intentions. He and his deputies currently are campaigning to convince Western politicians and the Western public that communists are harmless and that their ascension to power would strengthen democracy in Russia and improve the climate for foreign investment. This was the central theme of Zyuganov's message at the February 1996 Davos World Economic Forum in Switzerland,<sup>18</sup> at which he claimed that communists accept all forms of ownership of property and are simply trying to find the appropriate combination of private and state property for Russia. However, when U.S. Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) asked what he proposed to do to protect private property, Zyuganov avoided a direct answer.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Zyuganov's messages to the West contrast sharply with his statements designed for domestic consumption. His party's internal program clearly stands for ultimate control of all property by the government. However, he does not make this point when talking to foreigners. During a recent meeting with International Monetary Fund leaders, Zyuganov neglected to mention his interview last year in the Russian nationalist paper Zavtra (Tomorrow), in which he likened the IMF emissaries to Nazi regional leaders (Gauleiters) in Russia during World War II.<sup>20</sup>  Anatoly Chubais, Russia's former First Deputy Premier and architect of Yeltsin's privatization program, while speaking at the Davos forum in February warned that if the West flirted with Zyuganov, it would be responsible for the bloodshed that could well occur if the communists moved to renationalize private property. The only way communists can implement their true plans is through violence, said Chubais; they will never confine themselves solely to declarations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Any comparison of Zyuganov to Central and East European leftist leaders is misleading. The former communists in Hungary and Poland show clear signs of having adjusted to the noncommunist political and economic system. The Russian communists do not.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Intraparty Challenges.</b> Unlike Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the authoritarian leader of the ultra-nationalist Liberal-Democratic Party, Gennady Zyuganov is being challenged for the leadership both of his own party and of its Duma faction. His main rival is Communist Party Chief of Staff Valentin Kuptsov, who was a contender for the chairmanship in 1993. Kuptsov, who is sophisticated and exercises strict control over the party staff, reportedly is supported by two-thirds of the party's members and by more than half of its Duma faction. Kuptsov is even more hard-line than Zyuganov and could be an even tougher adversary for Russian reformers and for the West if he ever seized power.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Gennady Seleznyov, former chief editor of <I>Pravda</I> and Communist speaker of the State Duma, also has increased his influence significantly within the party. Even if Zyuganov should win the presidency, a possible shift of power to the parliament could leave him scrambling for support among Duma and party members controlled by Kuptsov and Seleznyov.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Many of Zyuganov's allies in the Duma are more ideologically moderate and better integrated into the present Russian establishment than the rest of the party. In fact, many of Zyuganov's supporters are not dyed-in-the-wool communists, but bureaucrats who feel deprived of the opportunities for quick enrichment which privatization and corruption have brought so many other bureaucrats in Yeltsin's administration.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the long run, Russian policy under Zyuganov could be expected to recreate a major threat to America's interests and those of its European allies. Zyuganov's promise (made in December 1995 after the Duma elections) to invade Estonia if NATO is expanded to the Baltics, his declarations that only a reconstituted Soviet Union is capable of confronting the United States, and his deeply rooted hostility to the West all would tend to make his government assume an almost viscerally confrontational posture toward the Euro-Atlantic community should he become president of Russia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There are policymakers around Zyuganov who advocate Russia's aggressive involvement in the Middle East, including supporting arms sales to existing and future radical and fundamentalist regimes in the region. The fate of the world's largest oil reserves would be at stake if Moscow again attempted to destabilize the Middle East.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If they put their campaign rhetoric into practice, Zyuganov and his team would move to reverse the outcome of the Cold War by attempting to build an anti-American coalition with Iran and China. Such a development undoubtedly would trigger a massive military buildup, both in the East and in the West, as arms control agreements with Russia unraveled.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Paradoxically, if Zyuganov came to power, the effect probably would be to accelerate NATO expansion to the East, as the West would interpret his election as an increased threat from Russia. The likely communist response to NATO expansion is predictable: confrontation with the West, intimidation of neighboring countries, and threats of a nuclear and conventional military buildup.

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Tuesday, January 21, 1997
</h3> <h2>Getting on With the Business of Governing</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> Now that
the shallow rhetoric of the inauguration is history, and now that the latest Gingrich matter
has been disposed of at least for the moment, may we please get down to the business of
running this nation?<p>

There is much pious talk about everyone getting along. There are all of these platitudes
about bipartisanship. There are visions of leaders meeting at a summit to come up with grand
agreements.<p>

Now let's get real.  The fact is while everything has been at a standstill since the
elections, the national debt has continued to expand.  Not a word has been heard by any of
our leadership about tackling that one. Oh, the deficit is down. But the deficit isn't the
problem.  It is the debt that is the problem and almost no one from either party is
discussing this little item which threatens to sink us all.<p>

Then there is the matter of Social Security. Some members of the latest Commission have
actually recommended that Social Security be privatized.  The defenders of the status quo
have, of course, said no.  At least this issue is at last, after years of total silence,
being debated.  The advocates of privatization need champions in the Congress.  They have
none in this Administration. Right now there are too many voices accusing and defending
Speaker Gingrich to find out if anyone is aware that we do have a Social Security problem on
our hands which urgently needs fixing.<p>

And then there is Medicare.  The President wants a fix which will last just long enough for
him to get out of office without the "gone bankrupt" sign being nailed to the door on the
oval office.  Some Republicans are talking about block grants to the states.  Others are
talking about privatization of Medicare through Medical Savings Accounts.  There are lots of
proposals.  No real solutions at hand. And the beat goes on.<p>

The food stamp problem gets worse every year.  The Congress did not have the political will
to do something about it in the 104th.  Does anyone think that the 105th Congress has more
political will than the last gathering?  If, however, this problem isn't tackled, the
welfare reform bill which passed in the last Congress and which Bill Clinton now wants to
repeal will end up effecting very little of the welfare mess this nation has amassed.  That
bill, after all, effected just six percent of the welfare and entitlement programs which are
federally funded.<p>

I am just touching on a few things here.  I haven't tackled regulation, national defense,
the evils of multinationalism, trade and a whole host of other problems staring us in the
face.  And we have time to utter meaningless slogans such as "nothing big has ever come from
being small?"  These problems come close to overwhelming us and yet we can spend days
pondering where the money should come from to pay Speaker Gingrich's fine?<p>

The way we are governed reminds me of how certain of my kids became experts at diverting
their parent's attention from the real issues we wanted them to face.  They did this by
creating a series of side shows.  The side shows were amusing for a time.  They even
succeeded in distracting us for a while.  Sooner or later, however, we and they had to face
the music.<p>

That time has come for America.  We've had our little vacation from reality.  The
celebrations are over.  Now, will someone, anyone, please propose some solutions which will
have lasting impact on the genuine problems facing the country?  Or as my kids used to ask:
"Are we there yet?" <P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Monday, January 20, 1997
</h3> <h2>Clinton's Second Term</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> William Jefferson Clinton has
now begun the term which will render a judgment of his Administration for history.  He is
the first Democrat to have begun a second elected term since FDR.  Ironically, he may be the
Democrat who presides over the beginning of the end of the welfare state which FDR left us. 
And it is even more ironic that Clinton's unending capacity to say one thing while doing the
opposite may just permit him to do so.  No Republican President would have been able to pull
it off.<p>

I have no idea what the next four years have in store for President Clinton.  He presided
over a first term during which inflation remained low, the stock market set new records, the
deficit shrunk, employment was high, and while our troops were spread far too thin, few have
come in harm's way, so far.  We all know that Presidents get and take far too much credit
for such developments, but it is fair, because had inflation tripled, the stock market
crashed, the deficit ballooned, unemployment set records, and our troops come home in body
bags, President Clinton certainly would have been blamed for all of this, whether he was
completely responsible or not.<p>

Clinton, given his record of a lifetime of close calls, may well escape Whitewater, Paula
Jones, the Lippo scandals, a recession, international disasters and anything else which can
befall a President.  Or all of his chickens could come home to roost during his second term,
much the same way Richard Nixon, after a successful first term, ended up in disgrace in his
second. Only God knows the answer, and speculation at this time is pointless.<p>

The fact is, whether we like it or not, the American people gave Bill Clinton this second
chance and he is entitled to his day of glory.  As for me, I am grateful that we live in a
nation where Clinton's opponent is given the medal of freedom instead of being put in jail. 
I thank God that opposition voices can be heard, even though those in power would have them
silenced.  That is nothing new. Just about every monarch and Prime Minister in history has
wanted to stifle opponents who had a following because of their opposition.  What is new is
that we live in a nation which, for the moment at least, has a Constitution which protects
those voices.  I appreciate the fact that we manage to carry on, often despite those who
lead us.<p>

Let us therefore rejoice in this day which the Lord has made  you who think Bill Clinton is
a great and worthy President and you who do not; you who find shame in the events of this
day and you whose heads are high  let us celebrate together.  Some will celebrate the man. 
We celebrate the idea  a fragile idea which, in many ways, defies history  that this
Republic shall continue to be a place for the brave and the free.<p>

Let us be mindful of what Pontius Pilot forgot.  All power in Heaven and on Earth comes from
above.  Neither Bill Clinton nor anyone else would have any power were it not for Almighty
God.<p>

The idea that God is still in charge, despite the frailties and foibles of our leaders, is
indeed something to celebrate this Inauguration Day, 1997. <P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Friday, January 17, 1997
</h3> <h2>A Lecture that Can't be Missed</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> I was so happy to
learn that Rep. Jim McDermott (D-WA), who may be prosecuted for his handling of the illegal
recording of the Gingrich tape, is giving a speech in Seattle on February 16th, entitled,
"Privacy in the age of new technology." The speech will be presented at a meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science. Mary Matalin said she had managed to
get a number of people to sign up for the $150 event. It would be worth it at any price.<p>

Well, that got me to thinking about what other lectures I might be missing. Then, I did an
Internet search, and what do you know, there are just lots of them. So I'll be very busy for
the next couple of weeks. For example, there is the $500 tax deductible lecture given by
Speaker Gingrich on "How to use a 501c3 Foundation to help Republicans make further gains in
Congress." It takes place in Atlanta next week. However, the ticket says "ethics committee
public hearings could produce the need for a rain date."<p>

Then there is the London lecture by Fergie for only $120 American dollars entitled, "How I
learned to live with fat." It seems it was booked before her latest deal with Weight
Watchers.<p>

Oh, and here is one I am really excited about: $100 per hour. Hmmm. That seems like an odd
price for a lecture. Well, anyway, it is by Dick Morris and is entitled, "How to have it
both ways: Enjoy a stable marriage and a swinging lifestyle at the same time." It takes
place at the Jefferson Hotel near the White House on Monday night, during Inauguration
festivities.<p>

Here's one that will take a bit of time, but I can't wait to hear it. The lecture will be in
the ancient city of Hebron and is being given next week by Benjamin Netanyahu. Its title is,
"When you elect a hard-liner to office, you can expect him to keep his campaign promises." 
Cost is 30 pieces of silver.<p>

Here's one I probably will miss: It is Mayor Marion Barry's lecture on "How I saved home
rule by standing up to a Republican Congress and a Democratic president." The cost is an
ounce of cocaine.<p>

But the $75 lecture by O.J. Simpson on "How I landed the Bruno Magli shoe contract after
everyone said I was through in advertising" is definitely worth flying to L.A. for.<p>

While I am there I will be taking in the $1,000 lecture by Barbara Streisand entitled, "How
my pal Bill Clinton let me sleep in the Lincoln bedroom with my boyfriend while he and his
girl were right next door." Speaking of pricey lectures, this one goes for $250,000 -- Wow.
But I guess it's worth it. The money goes to Al Gore who speaks on "How I continued the
traditional practice of separation of church and state while learning the value of the
Buddhist religion."<p>

But then, I have to hurry back to pay $350,000 for Bill Clinton's lecture. This is really
titillating. The President's topic will be "How to proposition a government employee while
avoiding sexual harassment charges." It would be worth it at twice the price. Proceeds, by
the way, go to the Bill Clinton Legal Defense fund.<p>

Of course that means I will have to miss the Tanya Harding lecture entitled "How graceful
moves and good PR made me a star."<p>

And all of that is this month, too. Wait till February when Boris Yeltsin gives his lecture,
from his hospital bed, on "My opponents only thought I was dead." The lecture is $450.00.
Cash only. No rubles.<p>

We'll I've got to run. There is still time to catch the lecture by David Bonior entitled
"How I brought down Newt Gingrich as Speaker of the House." I especially don't want to miss
this one: Bonior pays people to listen. <P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Thursday, January 16, 1997
</h3> <h2>We Used To Call It Extortion</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> I've told this story
before but it bears repeating.  A high official of Quaker Oats in Chicago told me that some
years ago Jesse Jackson held a press conference announcing that Quaker Oats would be
boycotted by his organization because Aunt Jemima is a racist symbol.  The corporate board
at Quaker Oats went crazy.  They held an emergency meeting.  My friend was called on to
negotiate with Jackson.  It turned out that what Jackson really wanted was money for his
Rainbow Coalition.  The Quaker official conveyed this to his board and they quickly agreed
to a huge contribution from the company to Jesse Jackson. Jackson then held a press
conference saying that upon reconsideration, Aunt Jemima was really a cultural symbol, not a
racist symbol and there would be no boycott.<p>

We used to have a name for that sort of behavior.  We used to call it extortion and people
used to go to prison for making such proposals.<p>

The story was called to mind again because yesterday in New York Jesse Jackson and the
National Organization for Women (NOW) announced they were calling off their consumer boycott
of Mitsubishi Motor Company in return for $200 million in potential business opportunities
for minorities and women.  I don't know what sort of business opportunities Mitsubishi has
in mind but I can just guess what the cut is for the Rainbow Coalition and now.<p>

Meanwhile, the parent firm of Denny's restaurants on the same day handed out $1.5 million to
nine civil rights organizations.  Guess who is in on the deal?  Why, the Rainbow Coalition,
of course.<p>

Now, I don't believe any company should engage in racial discrimination.  That is if race is
really at the bottom of it.  I do believe, however, that restaurants ought to be free to
tell people who behave badly to get lost.  I believe restaurants ought to be allowed to have
certain standards and if people come in who violate those standards the restaurants ought to
be able to throw them out with the help of the police.<p>

Race did seem to be a problem in some Denny's stores. that being the case, the managers of
these stores ought to have been summarily fired. Anyone who had been effected by their
behavior should have been entitled to a year's worth of free food or whatever.  The
Mitsubishi case is much weaker and seems to be confined to a very few individuals.  The
problem Mitsubishi has is the same one Quaker Oats had.  They don't want the bad publicity
caused by a Rainbow Coalition/NOW boycott.  So they write off millions as a cost of doing
business.  This is the American counterpart to bribing foreign bureaucrats in exchange for
business in some third world country.  Companies don't fight it, they just pass the cost on
to the consumers.<p>

Remember when the radical feminists boycotted the State of Colorado over the Equal Rights
Amendment some years back?  This got incredible coverage.  The fact that Colorado set a
record for tourism that year never got any attention.  You see, some of us held meetings in
Colorado that year just to make the point.  Colorado officials never backed down.  They
didn't suffer.  The radical gangs haven't boycotted a state since.<p>

They go where they get satisfaction.  When are these companies going to learn that they need
to stand up for their investors and for the customers who get stuck with the bill as well? 
Again, if some people are making slurs against blacks, fire them and make an example of them
for the whole company.  Word will get around.  Denny's corporate officials should have come
in to some of their stores and booted out personnel who wouldn't wait on blacks or other
minorities.  They could have then put their pictures in every Denny's to remind managers and
employees of what would happen to them if they were guilty of the same thing.  That would
make it clear. But to stick the investors of Flagstar Companies, the parent of Denny's, with
$54 million to settle a lawsuit because some people had to sit and wait to be served is
obscene.  Every Denny's I have ever seen is right next to about three of their competitors. 
I can't imagine these folks couldn't live without food prepared by Denny's prize winning
chefs!<p>

Some day soon, companies which are being held up this way are going to have to draw the
line. Some day the people who are calculating what business to strike next need to have
charges preferred against them under our extortion statutes.  Then the issue will finally be
debated for what it really is. <P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Wednesday, January 15, 1997
</h3> <h2>Where Are the Democrats of Conscience?</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> Frankly, I
would like to comment more on the so-called peace accord announced in the Middle East,
President Clinton's plan for the District of Columbia, developments in Belgrade, changes at
the Justice Department and other stories.  I am tired of the never-ending Gingrich story,
but I am compelled to comment once again on the actions of Congressman Jim McDermott, the
ranking Democrat on the so-called Ethics Committee.<p>

Please understand that I do not come from the camp which says Democrats are evil and do
nothing but evil things and Republicans are pure and none of their motives is suspect.  My
mother didn't raise an idiot.<p>

Yet even as much corruption as I have seen in three decades in both parties and involving
people from all parts of the political spectrum, I must say the McDermott flap takes my
breath away.<p>

Let's look at this situation from the other side.  Let us suppose instead that it was Dick
Gephardt who had been elected Speaker by a majority of Democrats two years ago, and that
Republicans were angry over this development so that they filed charge after charge against
Gephardt.  Nearly all the charges are dismissed.  In the process, however, they have caused
a two-year long investigation to take place that has resulted in a Special Counsel. In this
process, the ranking Republican on the Ethics Committee, Nancy Johnson, does not seem
interested in getting at the facts.  While not vocal in the outside world (she leaves that
to Tom DeLay), she nevertheless uses every tactic in the book to obstruct the investigation.
 She gives out information when she has no right to.  She leaks information about sensitive
matters to major media outlets.  Chairman McDermott is at his wits end. He has done
everything to try to be accommodating, but nothing satisfies Johnson.  When a bipartisan
agreement has been reached on hearings and a vote to punish Gephardt on the one charge which
finally was investigated, she blows apart the agreement, even to the dismay of other
Committee Republicans who have signed on board. While complaining constantly about a breach
of House rules, she breaks all the rules herself and throws the whole situation into
chaos.<p>

Then, along comes a couple of Republican activists.  They somehow manage to intercept a
cellular phone conversation which involves Speaker Gephardt talking with Martin Frost, David
Bonior and other Democratic leaders about how to deal with the media spin which Johnson and
DeLay and others were likely to put on the upcoming release of the ethics committee report.
The couple at first gives their tape to their local Congressman Mark Foley of Florida.  He
later says he never listened to the tape, and yet when these activists subsequently show up
at his office, he helps them write a letter to Johnson and suggests that they give her the
tape.  Johnson accepts the tape and has it for several days.  Then a transcript of the tape,
along with Johnson's spin, appears in the Wall Street Journal.  Suddenly the focus shifts
from Gephardt's problems to Johnson's handling of the tape. Leading Democrats call on
Republican Johnson to step down from the Committee.  She refuses to do so.  Instead, she
doesn't even mention the tape and issues a blast saying that Congressman McDermott, the
Chairman of the Committee, was responsible for conducting a charade and that his
chairmanship of the Committee was "arbitrary and authoritarian and autocratic."<p>

Now, I ask you?  Would all of that fly? <p>

How long do you think it would take other Republicans to distance themselves from Johnson? 
My betting is that by close of business today, at least 25 Republicans of all shades would
have said that Johnson doesn't speak for them, that the tape episode is a disgrace, that
Johnson should be prosecuted, and that she should resign as ranking Republican on the
Committee.  In fact, I think a handful of her colleagues would even suggest she resign from
Congress.  By tomorrow others would join that cry.  By Friday she would have resigned from
the Committee.  By the end of next week she would be gone from Congress.  And such would
have been the case if the roles and the parties had been reversed.<p>

I am not surprised that McDermott has behaved as he has.  He is one of the most bitterly
strident liberal Congressman the Democrats have in their caucus. His pathological hatred for
Newt Gingrich is well known.  I use the term advisedly.  McDermott is a psychiatrist by
profession.  What does surprise me is that the rest of the Democrats have stood by him. 
They continue to do so.  But why am I surprised?  Not a single democratic voice was raised
about Bill Clinton's scandals throughout the four years of his first term.  No one broke
ranks.  Some said privately they thought his administration was a disaster.  But was any
voice heard publicly?  Many Democrats are decent men. Some vote with conservatives on nearly
every substantive issue.  There are those who, by all appearances, have nicer families and
treat them better than do many Republicans.  But where are their standards?  Why doesn't
this outrage them the way it does some of the rest of us.  I am not outraged because
McDermott got caught stooping as low as he could to do in the Speaker.  I am outraged
because here is someone who has been an incredible obstructionist on the Ethics Committee
who is now engaged in something which, by every objective standard, is a lot worse, at least
in criminal terms, than anything Gingrich is accused of.  Why aren't we hearing from the
voices of decent Democrats on this matter?  Why do they, by their silence, defend the
indefensible? Perhaps most of them have been here too long. But there are some new Democrats
on the scene. By all accounts Congressman Virgil Goode of Virginia is a decent man.  He ran
against Chuck Robb in the Democratic primary for the US Senate because he said he was
offended by Robb's scandals. Why don't we hear him speaking out, calling for McDermott's
resignation?  There are other new Members such as Congressman Kind of Wisconsin, a former
prosecutor.  Friends tell me he is a decent fellow.  Where is his voice in all of this? <p>

I expect liberal scoundrels to behave like liberal scoundrels.  Even though the sheer
brashness of McDermott is worth noting, I am not ultimately surprised by his actions.  What
surprised me is the silence of those, like my long-time friend and associate Ralph Hall of
Texas, who know better. America needs to hear from them.  If Republicans who voted against
the Speaker can be praised by the media as men of conscience, where are similar men of
conscience in the other party? <P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Tuesday, January 14, 1997
</h3> <h2>Colorado's Growing Importance in Party Politics</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD>In
one of Ayn Rand's novels, the final fight for freedom takes place in Colorado. Well, I don't
expect this to be the final fight, but it is entirely possible that the National Chairman of
both parties will be from Colorado.<p>

President Clinton has now named Roy Romer, the three term Governor of Colorado, as the new
Democratic National Chairman and there is a fair chance that Republicans will end up with
GOP National Committeeman Jim Nicholson of Colorado as the successor to Haley Barbour. 
Perhaps all the news organizations will suddenly need bureaus in Denver.<p>

I have known Romer for over 30 years.  When I was News Director for a Denver radio station
in the mid 1960's, then-State Senator Romer was a candidate for the US Senate in the 1966
elections. His opponent was incumbent Senator Gordon Allott who was seeking a third term. I
spent a day with each of them traveling the state to produce a half-hour documentary on each
candidate called "A Day with..."  That is how I met Allott who a few months later brought me
to Washington as his Press secretary.<p>

Romer is described as a Centrist Democrat.  I suppose compared with some of the outright
Marxists occupying Congressional seats these days, that may be a correct description. 
However, the real Romer is very much like Bill Clinton.  He talks right, acts left.  And he
has been able to stay in the Governor's chair, with a Republican legislature, for years now.
 As with Clinton, the voters like the rhetoric, and don't watch the actions.  I last saw
Romer when I was covering the Democratic National Convention last Summer in Chicago.  This
was at the time of the Dick Morris scandal and Romer complained bitterly that Morris was
being accused of all sorts of things without his side of the story being heard.  I asked him
if he spoke up at the time Clarence Thomas was going through the same ordeal.  He said "No,
but I thought about it."<p>

In Romer, Clinton will have someone who is almost as comfortable with the right spin as is
the President himself.  It is truly a match made in, well, probably not Heaven, but you get
the idea.<p>

On the other side, it is clear now that no candidate has a majority of the votes to become
GOP National Chairman.  Just-retired Governor Steve Merrill had the inside track until it
was revealed that he had appointed Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign chairman to the State
Supreme Court.  It was the only appointment he had, and not only was his appointee tied up
with Clinton, but he was a director of the hated Legal Services Corporation as well.  That
may be too much for even some of the bland wimpy Republicans who make up the majority of the
National Committee.  The Texas GOP Chairman, Tom Pauken, is also one of the front-runners,
and certainly is my sentimental favorite.  He has been laboring in the vineyards for nearly
four decades for the principles I support.  But given the composition of that committee it
is hard to believe that Pauken will make it, especially since former Governor Bill Clements
has said that the worst mistake he ever made was supporting  Pauken for state chairman. 
Translated, Pauken brought in so many of the great unwashed rural Protestants and urban
Catholics that the business establishment no longer controls the party.  My guess is that
Pauken won't fly.<p>

I also think that Norcross of New Jersey may prove to be too liberal for even this crowd. 
In former years Ohio Chairman Bob Bennett would have had a good chance because he has a
splendid record of party-building in Ohio, but he doesn't look attractive on television.  So
the race may boil down to a couple of businessmen, Chuck Yob of Michigan or Jim Nicholson of
Colorado.  The voting system eliminates the lowest vote-getter one at a time, so if he can
hang in there until the end, Nicholson stands a good chance.<p>

Nicholson is a businessman who has taught himself to be articulate.  He has also learned
through his business that it is the culture that really matters in the long run, so he would
be more attuned to those sorts of issues than would the usual Republican.<p>

This race is more important for the Republicans than the Democrats. Bill Clinton will
overshadow Roy Romer simply because he is in the White House.  Romer will be left to explain
what Clinton does.  Whoever becomes Republican Chairman will often be their voice going into
the '98 elections.<p>

Still, anything can happen in the Republican contest.  It depends on who is able to put the
best coalition together.  If it does turn out to be Romer for the Democrats and Nicholson
for the Republicans, I feel it will be absolutely necessary for NET to open a Colorado
bureau.  I think I'll consult with the Chairman of the Free Congress Foundation Board, which
currently owns NET, on that issue.  His name happens to be Jeff Coors. <P>

</h3> <h2>The Passing of True Patriot</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD>I was tempted to devote
this commentary to the triumph of the Green Bay Packers Sunday.  Unless you are from
Wisconsin, you can't possibly imagine what that team means to Green Bay and even the rest of
the state.  With the possible exception of Chicago Cubs fans, I don't know of any group of
fans who are more loyal to their team.  They have had to wait 30 years for this moment and
yet they stuck by the Packers year after year even in losing seasons.  Out of deference to
Genevieve Wood, however, and because I have a much more serious topic to cover, I shall not
say anything further about Green Bay until after New Orleans.<p>

On a more somber note, today at the Heritage Foundation, some of us who have been active in
what is loosely called the conservative movement said good bye to one of our best friends. 
It was hard to do because for most of us it is hard to believe he is gone. Among those who
paid tribute to this author, broadcaster and historian were Heritage President Ed Feulner,
Publisher Jamison Campaigne, my daughter Dawn Ceol, Father Vince Rigdon of the Roman
Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, and yours truly.<p>

I first met Jeffrey St. John more than 25 years ago.  He was a syndicated columnist
operating out of New York.  I was a Senate aide.  We just hit it off and in the subsequent
years we developed an abiding friendship which is hard to put into words.<p>

Back before the op-ed pages were filled with conservative columnists of one sort or another,
Jeffrey St. John was there.  And he was fearless.  He later became business correspondent
for the "Today" show, and also reported for the CBS Morning News.  In addition he worked for
ABC radio news, and a host of local stations.  Indeed, when Senator Jesse Helms was elected
to the US Senate in 1972, it was Jeffrey St. John who took his place doing editorials.<p>

I always felt somewhat guilty because I passed on to St. John a report from an eye witness,
who happened to be a United States Senator, about disgusting behavior by the President of
the United States at a State dinner at the White House.  Fearless St. John asked President
Ford a question about this during a broadcast interview and President Ford was so outraged
he saw to it that St. John lost his network reporting job.  I felt terrible. St. John felt
it was a badge of honor.<p>

It is hard for those who have come into the general orbit of right-of-center politics since
Ronald Reagan won the Presidency in 1980 to imagine the plight of those of us who believed
in limited government, free enterprise, a strong national defense and traditional moral
values in the 1960's and 1970's.  After the defeat of Barry Goldwater, even sensible people
wouldn't use the "C" word. Retreat was evident nearly everywhere. Not with Jeffrey St. John.
He was always pushing the envelope.<p>

But the real Jeffrey St. John was a man of history.  He was, for example, among the nation's
foremost experts on John Randolph of Roanoke, one of the most interesting pioneer figures in
our Republic. St. John was at his best when he was relating history to contemporary
politics.  His three-book series on the deliberations of the founding fathers, done in the
style of a modern day reporter covering the Constitutional Convention, was so attractive to
Chief Justice Warren Burger that Burger not only wrote the introduction, but sent the books
to every high school library in the nation at the time of the Bicentennial.<p>

The difference between Jeffrey St. John and me is that he loved the battle.  I view it as
duty. Consequently he was always having to give me perspective when I would get down about
political happenings.<p>

An orphan, Jeffrey St. John was adopted at a young age and raised by a family in Canada. 
But he left home at age 14 and never saw his adoptive parents again.  He joined the military
and covered the Korean war for Stars and Stripes.  After the war, he became a reporter and
was a pioneer in the field of interactive talk radio, the format which is so celebrated
today. St. John was, as usual, decades ahead of his time.<p>

He married later in life and he and his wife Katherine had no children.  It is a pity
because he would have made a great father.  He and his wife became close friends of all of
the Weyrichs, as they frequently stayed with us when he came to Washington.<p>

It is important that we remember those brave souls who made it possible for us to stand
where we are today.  Jeffrey St. John was one such patriot.  His golden voice now stilled,
his pen now put to rest, the nation is the poorer for it all.  Thank God, before he died, he
returned to the Church of his youth.  He will be missed by all who love liberty and admire
courage.  May God have mercy upon his soul.  Jeffrey St. John, dead at age 66. <P>

</h3> <h2>Excluded from the White House List</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> I'm really
bummed! I mean here I and my co-conspirators -- I mean colleagues -- here at NET have spent
more than three long years trying to make the White House' top-ten "right-wing nut-cases"
chart and we didn't cut it! What's a CEO to do?  All of those millions of Dollars wasted.<p>

And to think that all of the scandals the Clinton Administration has been involved in are
the result of one meddling millionaire named Dick Scaife.  Now, I've received money from
Scaife to be sure, but apparently I'm not high enough in the conspiracy structure to have
received his orders.  I feel offended.  Scaife and I have been friends for some 25 years
now, and after all these years, he didn't even let me in on the conspiracy.  It just shows
you can't trust even friends anymore.  I mean, don't I deserve just one little directive
from him demanding that we cover some totally concocted story against Bill Clinton and the
Democrats?  What's the matter with us?<p>

I mean, I realize I was born on the wrong side of the tracks, so maybe it's a class thing. 
You see, I thought I had a real in with Scaife.  You see, just between us, the truth is that
the two of us belong to an elite group of unique people who love electric streetcars.  Now,
on that basis alone you would think he would have at least given me a plain brown envelope
with a hint of what new charge I should make up against Clinton. But no, apparently, at
least according to the White House, Dick Scaife prefers to send all of his orders to the
American Spectator.  Well, I don't mind admitting it.  I'm jealous.<p>

Not only does Bob Tyrrell apparently have an in with my trolley jolly friend Scaife, but
apparently he spends all of his time feeding his totally made up stories about Clinton's
scandals to the Internet.  Boy, that's a surprise.  You see I sort of thought of Tyrrell as
a classy playboy.  I mean I always see him at parties with some good looking chick on his
arm.  Now I learn this is all a facade.  Secretly, in the middle of the night, Tyrrell was
really not having a fun time.  He was obviously creating new web sites so the likes of the
Wall Street Journal and the Washington Times could get their biased and slanted information
on Clinton without so much of a trace of a phone call between them.<p>

But then, the plot really gets clever. It is really amazing that London tabloids pick up all
of this stuff and give it legitimacy over here by printing it in their papers over in the UK
so that Congressional Republicans will immediately call hearings on these totally made up
scandals  scandals like Whitewater and Travelgate and Troopergate and the Democratic party
money laundering scam and who knows what else.<p>

Come to think of it, now I understand why Al D'Amato, Jim Leach and Bill Clinger kept
yelling at their staffs "where is my latest London tabloid?"  You, see it is finally making
sense.  And this guy Scaife is really good.  I mean to have all that control over the
Congress, just to get them to investigate phony, made up stories on Clinton so that the
Washington Post and the New York Times would be forced to cover the stories. And these are
the same papers Scaife and his friends have always criticized as biased and slanted! Imagine
the cleverness of making establishment newspapers the unwitting fellow-travelers of this
incredible conspiracy.  Wow!  That's impressive.<p>

I'm still ticked at Scaife, though, for keeping me in the dark.  Twenty-five years and not a
hint of any of this.  I mean a quarter of a century and not one demand that I do anything
for his money.  Maybe he doesn't like Greek Catholics.  Well, now that I know how this one
guy in Pittsburgh controls the media worldwide.  I know one thing: forget Rupert Murdoch. 
Nix on Katherine Graham and her ilk.  Heck, don't even mention Disney.  When it comes to
media empires that really matter, I know all of my spare money is going to buy stock in the
Pittsburgh Tribune Review.<p>

Still and all, I can't help but think that I've heard this whole plot before, some time ago.
 Come to think of it, it was another President who had this theory about a big media
conspiracy.  What was his name again?  Surely you remember.  A medium-sized fellow with his
hands always flung in the air giving the victory sign.  Come on, help me out.  His last name
began with an "N."  Let's see Richard Milhous Nut-case?  No, that wasn't it.  Well, anyway,
you know who I mean. <P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Thursday, January 9, 1997
</h3> <h2>A Separate Class for the Elite</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> Bill Clinton is
someone who doesn't like to face major problems.  He seldom proposes politically risky
solutions to serious difficulties facing the nation.  His Medicare fix, for example, would
simply tide the system over until Clinton leaves office.  That has been true of much of what
he has proposed, with the exception of his first term health care initiative, which was
really Hillary's baby.<dd>

So Bill Clinton is praying that the Supreme Court will see things his way as the Paula Jones
case is taken up once again.<dd>

Clinton's lawyers, including the highly-priced Bob Bennett, argue that the President should
be protected from civil lawsuits while in office.  Richard Cohen, the liberal columnist for
the Washington Post, puts the argument this way: "In the end, only two people know what
happened that day in Little Rock, and their stories are not likely ever to conform.  Jones
deserves her day in court -- but not necessarily right away and not if it means that
Presidents can be legally harassed by their political enemies."<dd>

Paula Jones was no enemy of Bill Clinton.  She wasn't involved in politics at all.  It is
true that she received and took bad advice by surfacing her case at C-PAC, the Conservative
Political Action Committee annual conference in Washington.  It is also true that the
attorneys she ended up with are partisan Republicans.  That has more to do with her economic
standing than it has to do with any political motives on her part.<dd>

But those facts should not obscure the fact that what this case is really all about is
sexual harassment.  If Army drill sergeants must face the music for their misdeeds, why not
the President of the United States, their Commander-in-Chief?<dd>

What is really at stake in the Supreme Court action on the Paula Jones case is whether the
President of the United States constitutes a special class all by himself.  One set of rules
applies to him. Another set of rules applies to the rest of us.<dd>

By the way, I have taken this position consistently for nearly thirty years.  Richard
Nixon's imperial style Presidency was as offensive to me as is this Clinton argument on Paul
Jones.  I said so publicly back then.<dd>

The President's legal team argues that were he to have to stand trial on this lawsuit, it
would interfere with his work as President.  This is a President who plays golf frequently;
a President who just attended the Renaissance week-end where he mostly played hooky and
didn't attend many lectures.  This is a President who just returned from a family vacation
in the Virgin Islands.  I don't begrudge him these interludes.  Some of our better
Presidents have had a decent amount of leisure time. President Eisenhower played lots more
golf than Bill Clinton does, and Ronald Reagan frequently took naps in the middle of the
day.  On the other hand, Jimmy Carter worked day and night.  So the success of a Presidency
is not necessarily tied to hard work.<dd>

By the same token, a President who has time to engage in frequent recreation and who does
not hesitate to vacation, cannot at the same time argue, which Clinton does, that he is just
too busy to tend to this lawsuit.<dd>

The notion that political enemies would simply file frivolous lawsuits against the President
to harass him if the Jones case is allowed to go to trial now is preposterous.  A President
is sued almost daily over his policies in office.  That is fair game.  But a lawsuit
alleging improper personal conduct would have to have some basis or else it would be
dismissed immediately. <dd>

Paula Jones, before she filed the suit, had nearly gotten Bill Clinton to acknowledge that
he knew her, that they were in the same hotel together, and that he would apologize if
anything he had said had been misinterpreted by her.  At the last minute, Clinton decided
not to settle and the case went to court.<dd>

I also have no idea what went on in the hotel room where Paula Jones contends that then
Governor Bill Clinton exposed himself to her.  We would soon find out in a trial if she made
this story up. <dd>

But I do know this.  It is a dangerous doctrine which suggests that the President of the
United States is, even temporarily, above the law.  One of the reasons why the United States
was so different from other nations, even other nation states with democratically elected
governments, is precisely the fact that we always viewed our Presidents as men of the
people.  Yes, they may receive special treatment while in office to facilitate their conduct
of official business, but they are, in the words of Richard Nixon's critics, "not above the
law."<dd>

If the court goes along with Clinton, and I suspect they will because they themselves view
themselves as part of the nation's elite, then we will have established a special class of
citizen. Someone who, for four or eight years, does not have to face the consequences of his
own actions. Who will be next?  Senators?  I worked for two of them and I can attest that
they had mind boggling schedules.<dd>

True if Bill Clinton's trial is postponed, he will still have to face Paula Jones when he
leaves office.  But by then national interest in the case will be minimal.  Who pays any
attention to what happens to George Bush in his personal life these days?  The very
compensation which Jones seeks in her lawsuit, namely the restoration of her good name,
would be effectively denied her if the trial is postponed.<dd>

Clinton's lawyers say that Jones would not have suffered the loss of her good name if she
hadn't stepped forward with her lawsuit.  Let's not forget that she only did so when an
Arkansas State Trooper contended in an article for the American Spectator that Paula Jones
was the willing girlfriend of the Governor.<dd>

I am very afraid that this court will disregard what is really at stake in this case and
will grant the extra time to Bill Clinton.  Thus they would be blinded to the fact that
Clinton's behavior is the basis for this lawsuit.  Why haven't we had lots of personal
lawsuits against former Presidents who did not have any court ruling that they would have to
be protected from trials while in office.  Simply put, these recent former Presidents never
conducted themselves in such a way so as to provoke such lawsuits.  They were by no means
perfect, but they weren't out cruising for trouble with strangers either. <dd>

If Bill Clinton is upheld in this case, we will take another giant step away from a
government of the people, by the people and for the people. <P> <blockquote> <a

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Wednesday, January 8, 1997
</h3> <h2>A Second Chance for Gingrich</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> Considering the burden
on his shoulders,  Newt Gingrich performed well yesterday as he became the first Republican
Speaker to be re-elected to that post since l928.<dd>

His speech to the House was statesman like and hit just the right tone for the occasion.
Gingrich's re-election was not the foregone conclusion the rest of the House leadership
claimed it was for the past two weeks. There were nine Republican defectors.  Four of them
were really serious defectors.  They voted for another candidate.  Had the other five who
voted "present" cast their ballots for a different candidate than Gingrich and had they
added just one more defector to their ranks, Gingrich would not have been re-elected, at
least not on the first round.  It was close.  Some of those who voted "present" had been
inclined to vote for another candidate but were talked out of that scenario by some in the
leadership, including Gingrich himself.<dd>

Whether Gingrich has really learned anything from this episode or not will be determined by
two factors.  First, how does he treat his defectors. Ronald Reagan was an artful leader.
His then Secretary of Education Terrell Bell complained bitterly in his book about the
Reagan years that he had seen me on television attacking one of Reagan's policies on one day
and then bumped into me as I was going into a meeting with the President the very next day.
Reagan did not take it personally when some of us opposed his policies.  The first Gingrich
term was often marked by petty hostility to those who crossed him, especially if they were
conservative.  The Speaker needs to look beyond the vote yesterday and to the larger
question of where he is going to lead his majority.  If he treats the nine defectors too
badly he is buying further trouble with some of his supporters.  More than one Congressman
has warned the Speaker that his tenure as Speaker could be cut short if he takes it out on
those who didn't vote for him in the Republican ranks.  A move to reconsider the vote as
Speaker can be made by anyone who voted for Gingrich at any time and it becomes a privileged
motion.  The Speaker, after all, has to still face a vote on he report by the Ethics
Committee, perhaps as early as the end of this month. <dd>

That brings me to my second point.  I was asked last evening on a syndicated radio show how
Gingrich could overcome the media created image which now has a majority of Americans
believing that the Speaker has more ethical problems than the President of the United
States.  I answered with just three words: "Push an agenda".  A solid agenda which advances
the cause of limited government, a strong defense and traditional moral values, will
overcome the Speaker's adversity in a matter of a few weeks.  If Americans can be involved
in the policy process of governing the country, and if they generally agree with the
Speaker's agenda, they will forget about the Speaker's problems, even though his Democratic
opponents will raise those issues every chance they can get.<dd>

Even though this commentary is about the Speaker, a word needs to be said about the conduct
of some of  the Democrats.  When minority leader Dick Gephardt turned the gavel over to the
Speaker, he said it was his "responsibility" to do so.  He didn't say it was his high honor
or privilege to do so, words which usually accompany that ceremony.  Perhaps Gephardt was
still smarting from Monday's Washington Post editorial entitled "Why Gephardt will never be
Speaker".  It suggested that  Mr. Gephardt's ethics problems are worse than the Speaker's
and are almost certainly deliberate, as opposed to Gingrich's problems which appear to be
more inadvertent.<dd>

And then there was Minority Whip David Bonior.   While his fellow Democrats were giving
Gingrich three standing ovations during the course of the Speaker's 19 minute oration,
Bonior sat down, did not clap, and frowned angrily, a reaction no doubt to the fact that he
took on Gingrich and lost. <dd>

Despite a passion for a good fight, most Americans still admire sportsman like conduct. 
These Democratic leaders didn't display any of that yesterday. <dd>

So, Speaker Gingrich is being given another chance.  Either he will seize this moment in
history, as he did with his fine speech yesterday, and he will lead the country in the right
direction or he will not.  When all is said and done, Speaker Gingrich will be remembered in
history not for his ethics problems but for whether things changed in a positive direction
during his tenure or things declined further.  History only gives most political figures one
chance.  Speaker Gingrich needs to thank God for this second chance and to take the
responsibilities of governing for the common good very seriously. <P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Tuesday, January 7, 1997
</h3> <h2>Rethinking Diplomatic Immunity</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> A sort of
international drama has been playing out in both Washington and New York over the
long-debated question of diplomatic immunity.<dd>

In Washington, a 16-year-old girl, Joviane Waltrick, was killed in a tragic traffic accident
caused by an apparently intoxicated diplomat from the former Soviet Republic of Georgia. The
United States has formally asked the nation of Georgia to lift diplomatic immunity and
permit the young Georgian diplomat to be tried on a change of negligent homicide here in the
United States.<dd>

Meanwhile in New York City, two diplomats from the former Soviet Republic of Belarus got
involved in a brawl with New York City police after the police tried to arrest them for a
traffic violation. Officials from Belarus charge that the police engaged in brutality and
broke the arm of one of the diplomats in the process. New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said
the diplomats were drunk and disorderly and moreover didn't pay their parking ticket. He has
now suggested that such members of the diplomatic community ought to go back to where they
came from and has ordered his police to begin towing their cars the same way cars of
ordinary citizens get towed if they violate parking regulations. The Russians, for example,
have 14,437 summonses for 222 cars stationed in New York, primarily at the United Nations,
which they have yet to pay.<dd>

Back in Washington, the U.S. State Department was on the defensive arguing that diplomatic
immunity needs to continue. In answer to the questions of angry reporters, the State
Department could not point to a single instance where diplomatic immunity has been waived by
a nation after a serious crime was committed. In most instances, such diplomats are simply
sent back to their native land.<dd>

It should be understood that the idea of diplomatic immunity was pushed by the United States
in the first place. It was this nation which insisted on most of the treaties or
understandings in this regard which are currently in effect. This is because the United
States was afraid, and rightly so, that its citizens could  break some unknown law in a
foreign country and thus be subject to punishment for such infractions according to local
practices. In the former Soviet Union, it was easy to break their laws. Many were made up
along the way, according to circumstance. Infractions there could well have caused Americans
to have been put to death or to have suffered long incarcerations in Soviet prisons. Right
now, in this age, it is unlawful in Saudi Arabia to attend a Roman Catholic Mass, for
example. A diplomat who simply wanted to exercise freedom of religion as he knows it in this
country could actually be put to death for doing so.<dd>

So there are valid reasons that the practice of diplomatic immunity was pushed by this
nation. And our diplomats will continue to need this sort of protection since rights which
we take for granted here are not guaranteed in most of the other nations of this world.<dd>

On the other hand, it seems to me that the negotiation of new agreements is in order. The
idea of diplomatic immunity was meant to protect citizens from arbitrary punishment for
violating unknown or obscure laws or laws which contradict practices which are commonly
accepted in the United States. Driving while drunk and thus endangering the lives of others,
it seems to me, is not acceptable in any nation. Without endangering the concept of immunity
which still has its utility, we need to see if we can't come up with agreements on such
issues which have the same meaning in all nations.<dd>

Georgian President Edward Shevrednadze has hinted that his government might consider waiving
diplomatic immunity in the case of his diplomat. If he does, that would set an excellent
example. But such a precedent is not good enough.<dd>

If we as a nation are capable of negotiating the fine points of peace between the Israelis
and the Palestinians, if we are capable of coming up with agreements for Northern Ireland or
Bosnia, surely we can do better than the present situation.<dd>

The Congress should mandate that the State Department form an immediate task force charged
with the responsibility of making recommendations on new agreements covering situations such
as the death of Joviane Waltrick or even Mayor Giuliani's complaints.<dd>

If our diplomats abroad drive while intoxicated and kill local residents of some nation,
they ought to suffer the appropriate local consequences. Issues like this have little to do
with the notion of protecting diplomats from arbitrary and capricious rules and laws which
are meant to entrap foreigners. I know I am talking about the State Department here, but
let's get down to some common sense. <P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Monday, January 6, 1997 </h3>
<h2>Will the Supreme Court Turn Lose Dr. Death?</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> In many ways,
a nation can be judged by how it treats the weakest of its people, those unable to fend for
themselves.  No, I am not making an argument for welfare benefits here.  Much of the
government assistance which has been granted over the past many decades has made people weak
and dependent.  There government intervention is counterproductive.  I am talking here about
those who cannot speak for themselves.  The unborn constitute one such group at one end of
the spectrum.  The aged and infirm, especially those who are disabled, are at the other end
of the spectrum. <dd>

The U.S. Supreme Court, having taken away the force of law which at one time protected the
rights of the unborn, is now about to hear Glucksberg vs. the State of Washington and Vacco
vs. Quill.  These cases will determine if the Supreme Court will now find a "Constitutional"
right to die the way the Court found the "right of privacy" which led to abortion on demand.
 Also being tested is physician assisted suicide.  In other words, will the Supreme Court
turn lose Dr. Deaths, symbolized by Jack Kevorkian, in every community in the land?.  The
way this Court has shown such an utter disregard for the sacredness of life, I would not be
at all surprised to see a majority opinion affirming death at this end of the spectrum as
well. <dd>

Evan Kemp, Jr., who was Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission during the
Bush Administration, and who has had a disabling disease since he was 12 years old, had a
moving piece in Sunday's Washington Post op-ed section entitled, "Could you Please Die Now?"
 In it, Kemp argues forcefully against the idea that assisted suicide should be legalized,
because, he rightfully contends, disabled people like himself have the most to fear from
such an idea. <dd>

Already, some hospitals are virtually forcing patients to sign "do not resuscitate" or DNR
orders requesting that so called heroic measures not be taken to keep the patient alive in
the case of an emergency which might develop.  Kemp goes on to cite several cases which are
just a sample of things to come if the court rules the way that some us fear it will.  Joe
Ehman is a 30 year old newspaper reporter in Rochester, New York who uses a wheelchair. 
Social workers hounded the poor man to sign a DNR form when he entered the hospital in 1995
for back surgery.  He declined to do so.  But just a few hours after surgery, while he was
still half under the anesthetic, another social worker tried to again get him to sign such a
form.  He managed to let her know that he would not because he didn't want to die.  God only
knows what would have happened had Ehman not had the presence of mind to resist. <dd>

He might have suffered the fate of Marjorie Nighbert, a 76 year old Florida woman who was
hospitalized last year after a stroke.  She did sign a DNR order, so her family used that to
push the apparently willing hospital authorities to deny the lady food and water.  The
hospital medical ethics committee ruled that she was "not medically competent to ask for
such treatment."  The lady starved to death 10 days later, strapped down to her hospital bed
to prevent her from stealing food from other patient's trays.<dd>

Kemp, for whom my daughter once worked as a speech writer, has more than a casual interest
in the subject.  When he was diagnosed with a progressive neomuscular disease, doctors gave
him just two years to live.  That was 47 years ago.  He, as with so many people we have
known, beat the odds.  What if, on the basis of their original estimate of his life span,
his doctors had decided that it would be better for him to die.  That way, he wouldn't have
been such a burden to his family.  Yes, Kemp is right when he suggests that the right to die
is going to lead to health care rationing.  Once we give physicians the right to help people
who supposedly are terminally ill and want to die, it is just a very short leap to permit
these same physicians to determine that a person should die even against his will because he
would require too much medical care for too long. It is coming and coming fast. The fact
that no jury in Michigan would convict Dr. Kevorkian tells us that society has bought the
notion that we, not God, ought to determine when we die.  If we can do that for ourselves,
why not someone else?.<dd>

It is not for nothing that Evan Kemp draws an analogy between what we are seeing today and
Hitler's first attempt at killing, which was of those who had disabilities, which he did on
the basis that such people were "useless eaters" and constituted "life unworthy of life". 
When that was tolerated by the society, the mass killing of Jews was not far behind. <dd>

Kemp, despite his disabilities, will be one of hopefully thousands who will be keeping vigil
outside the Supreme Court as they hear these cases. It is an unusual coalition.   Dr. C.
Everett Koop, former Surgeon General, will be among those addressing this mass protest
because he believes that the disability community is "so threatened by physician assisted
suicide."  For once the Clinton Administration, the AMA, the Catholic Church, Orthodox Jews,
the disability community and most conservatives are all on the same side.  The ACLU, which
always claimed to speak for the less fortunate, is to be sure on the side of death.  <dd>

Many of you watching this commentary can't be there with this Coalition.  But you can write
and let the Supreme Court know what you think on the subject.  Perhaps had that been done in
1972 when oral arguments were heard on Roe vs. Wade, the nation would have been spared that
horrendous decision which has led us directly to this point.  Never make the mistake of
believing that the Court is isolated from public opinion.  Not this court anyway.  This is
one issue where all of us have a stake in letting this aging court know where we stand. 
Maybe, just maybe, considering that they may one day soon be in a position where some doctor
or family member wants them to die before their time, just maybe they will understand. <P>

<h2>Senate Should Not Seat Landrieu</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> It was exactly 30 years
ago, January 5th, 1967, when this naive, eager 24-year-old set foot inside what is now the
Dirksen Building (Dirksen was still alive then) to begin to work in the U.S. Senate. What an
education that was. Within the first month I learned something which utterly shocked me. The
Senator I worked for introduced a bill in the Senate with which he didn't agree. When I
questioned this, he said he did so to help a constituent. I said, in my ignorance, "But what
if the bill gets passed?" Gordon Allott smiled at my question and said reassuringly, "I have
a deal with Scoop [Jackson (D-WA), then Chairman of the Senate Interior Committee] that the
bill will never see the light of day." And this, by the way, was done by one of the most
honest men ever to have served in the Senate.<dd>

Such began my insight into the long-playing game of Washington deception. The trick is to
look like you are doing one thing while doing the opposite. These games never cease.<dd>

The Senate is getting ready to seat Mary Landrieu of Louisiana "without prejudice," meaning
that if it turns out there is sufficient evidence of voter fraud in the recent Senate
election there, theoretically the seat could be vacated and a new election held. I say
theoretically because, although key Senators are telling Landrieu's opponent Woody Jenkins
otherwise, the fact is the way this is being orchestrated means the race is over. Even if
the Senate Rules Committee concluded that there was enough fraud in the election to have
turned the results (and more evidence is coming in every day), all the Democrats would have
to do is to filibuster and Mary Landrieu would keep her Senate seat. And they would, of
course. This is all a cozy little deal worked out between the majority and the minority in
the Senate.<dd>

The fact is, if the Republican majority were serious about the problems in Louisiana, they
would not allow Mary Landrieu to be seated at all. That is what the Democrats did to Louis
Wyman of New Hampshire, the certified winner of the Senate race in that state in 1974. The
Democrats claimed voter irregularities. There was no evidence whatsoever of the sort that
has turned up in Louisiana. In any case, the majority in 1975 refused to seat Wyman.
Governor Meldrim Thompson then appointed just-retired Senator Norris Cotton to the Senate
seat to serve in the interim and a new election was held. In that election, the certified
winner, Louis Wyman, was defeated by the loser of the general election in 1974, John
Durkin.<dd>

This took place before Vice President Nelson Rockefeller maneuvered to change the Senate
rules. In those days, Republicans could have mounted a filibuster with just 34 votes. They
had 38 Senators that year. Democrats didn't take that chance. They did not seat
certified-winner Wyman conditionally.<dd>

The fact is that there is evidence enough right now to deprive Mary Landrieu of that Senate
seat. If only the Republican majority had the stomach for confrontation this is exactly what
they would do. Instead, we will go on with the charade of an investigation. From their point
of view, the Republicans will do Woody Jenkins the favor of validating his claims and lay
the blame on the Democrats for filibustering a move for a new election.<dd>

Well, Republicans, how about doing the nation a favor? How about preserving the integrity of
our electoral system? How about, for once, standing up and behaving as if you were the
majority? Mary Landrieu should not be sworn in as a Senator in the 105th Congress on
Tuesday. This would be the perfect occasion to stop playing games and to start leveling with
the American people.<P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Thursday, January 2, 1997
</h3> <h2>The Truth Is Spreading</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> A quarter of a million
people jammed into Belgrade's main square New Year's day to continue their protest against
Yugoslavian Communist President Slobodan Milosevic's having voided opposition  victories in
23 municipal elections. <dd>

These demonstrations have been continuing on a daily basis for weeks now, and they have
begun to threaten the last Communist regime on the European continent. <dd>

The demonstrators are unarmed.  Milosevic's troops are armed to the teeth, yet betting is
with the street demonstrators.  Why?<dd>

The real weapon which the people have today in Yugoslavia which wasn't available to people
in past decades who lived under Communist regimes is underground media.  A low power FM
station in Belgrade, which can't even be heard in some parts of the city, has now formed an
alliance with other small stations throughout the country and is broadcasting the truth to
the people.  Meanwhile, the state controlled radio and television, which dominate the
country, hardly mention that anything is happening.  Thanks to the Internet, which kept the
voice of the radio station alive for a short period when the government shut it down,
information is now available to citizens which would have been unthinkable a decade ago.
<dd>

A Communist regime can exist only if the people are ignorant and isolated.  That is how the
Soviets kept power for seven decades.  I am no fan of Mikhail Gorbachev.  His own people
demonstrated what they thought of him by giving him a half of one per cent of the vote in
last year's Russian Presidential primaries.  But Gorbachev did one positive thing which
ultimately led to his downfall.  At the urging of President Ronald Reagan and British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, Gorbachev stopped the jamming of the BBC worldservice, the Voice
of America and eventually Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe a decade ago.  No doubt
Gorbachev did not understand the dynamic of the information age.<dd>

Yet once the people of the Soviet empire had access to alternative information, the
Communist regime there was doomed.  The Communists had the tanks and trained armies and a
huge spy network, but it could not compete with the truth.  I well recall an official
government hosted dinner I attended in Irkutsk, near Lake Baikal, in the same lodge where a
couple of months earlier Secretary of State James Baker and then Soviet Foreign Minister
Edward Shevrednaze had met.  Irkutsk is in the middle of Siberia.  Yet officials there were
more up on American politics than most Americans and more sympathetic to America than at
least a third of its own people.  This was in 1990, a full year before the flag of the
Soviet Union was lowered over the Kremlin.  The reason?  These Siberians had built
themselves tiny little crystal set type radios and pulled in information from Voice of
America which for the previous decades they could not hear.  I knew after I attended that
dinner that the Soviet empire as we knew it was doomed.<dd>

Broadcast information had created a bigger fifth column inside the Soviet Union than the KGB
could handle.<dd>

The same thing is happening in Yugoslavia a decade later.  Even some in the Milosevic
controlled army have told their commanders that they will not shoot at the opposition
demonstrators.  There may yet be much bloodshed, because dictators don't give up easily. 
But in the end the Communists will fall.<dd>

Remember Tienamen Square? Recall that for the first several days of street demonstrations
there the local soldiers were sympathetic to the students.  The reason the confrontations
dragged on for so long is that the Communist Chinese had  to call in troops from the far
provinces to suppress the democracy movement. The local troops would not shoot.  Troops from
the backwater places in China, where information is not readily available, were told that
China had been invaded by a foreign power. It took that kind of lie to crush democracy. But
as the Internet advances and more information is now available from Taiwan and elsewhere,
that sort of lie won't cut it  forever.<dd>

That is why I am betting on what has been called "the information Guerrillas" in Yugoslavia.
 The truth, ultimately, is more powerful than armies.  It is too early to tell at the
moment, but 1997 could be the last year for the Milosevic regime.  His ability to keep his
people loyal has been dependent on keeping the truth out.  But the truth is spreading.  As
with the mighty Soviet Union, the truth may prove too powerful for the remaining Communist
regimes to survive. <P>

<h2>People Are Tired Of The Media Elite</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>The Media Research Center engaged the Harris poll to do a survey of the 
news media and, in the words of Robert Lichter, the Center's Director, 
"people are tired of the media elite."
<DD>
It is about time. Media has been out of control in this nation for a 
long while, especially with the shift to advocacy journalism which 
occurred in the late 1960's and early 1970's accelerated by Watergate.
Now two thirds of the public, according to Harris, want just the facts 
rather than the journalists' judgment calls in stories involving public 
figures.
<DD>
The top complaints the public has against journalists are the 
following: Journalists ignore people's privacy. Ask Richard Jewell if 
he agrees with that one. Journalists are politically biased. The funny 
thing is that everyone from Jesse Jackson to Jesse Helms would agree 
with that complaint. Journalists are too influenced by the powerful. 
The real problem here isn't that journalists are paid off. The problem 
is that the powerful have access to important information and they 
become the sources for the journalists. You don't bite the hand that 
feeds you. Journalists provide one sided coverage. Take a look at any 
story, on television or in a major metropolitan daily. You will find 
that the opposing viewpoint to the thesis of the story will either be 
at the very end of the story, mentioned only briefly, or it will be 
entirely missing.
<DD>
Journalists are too negative. The prevailing attitude 
in newsrooms these days is that America is among the worst places on 
earth and that we are responsible for most of the world's problems. If 
you have that view, it is not hard to be negative. Journalists have too 
much influence. I can personally report on hundreds of meetings I have 
attended with political figures over the past 30 years, the outcome of 
which was driven by fears of the media and not by what was best for the 
nation. Journalists abuse freedom of the press. Nothing is sacred 
anymore to some journalists. If you know it, air it is their slogan, 
regardless of who is hurt.
<DD>
Journalists don't care about people. We live 
in a cynical age, but you can take that cynicism to the l0th power by 
surveying any newsroom. The media makes people guilty until proven 
innocent and when they are proven innocent they drop the story. The 
media portrays too much violence. The media believes that the public 
has an insatiable appetite for the gory details on everything and 
judging by the ratings of various TV shows, the media may be right on 
that score. The media is often inaccurate. Concern for accuracy went 
out the window with The New York Times v. Sullivan case. In that case, 
since expanded by the U.S. Supreme Court, the ruling was that anyone 
suing the media over misstatements had to prove malice in order to 
collect. That is well understood by the lowest journalist on the 
ladder.
<DD>
The media is too sensational. Again, the public needs to look 
to itself on this question. Unfortunately it is the sensational 
coverage of things which gets the ratings and sells the papers. 
Journalists ignore their errors. They do indeed. Retractions happen all 
too seldom on television and in the papers, retractions are generally 
on page 2, the least read of all of the pages of the newspaper.
I agree with most of the findings of this survey, but one issue greatly 
disturbs me. An astounding 84% of the public says that the government 
could require balanced reporting of controversial issues to the point 
of imposing a fine for inaccurate or biased reporting. Hold on just a 
minute here. The same people, a majority of whom in the Harris survey 
find the media too liberal, wants the Clinton Administration to force 
balanced reporting?
<DD>
When we had the so called "Fairness Doctrine" in 
force, we didn't have radio and television talk shows as we now know 
them because most stations didn't want the burden of providing repines 
time for opposing viewpoints.
<DD>
Government is not the solution to this very serious problem just as 
government is not the solution to much of anything. This calls to mind 
the statement of Senator Bill Cohen of Maine, Clinton's new Defense 
Secretary." Government," he said, "is the enemy  until you need a 
friend." I am afraid that is the attitude of far too many Americans 
these days. We complain about the excesses of big government, but as 
soon as there is a problem as big as this one is, we want the 
government to solve it. The government is the last place we want to 
turn to solve the problem of inaccurate, biased and abusive media. Most 
Americans don't seem to understand that they have the power to control 
all of this. If we don't buy their papers, advertisers won't spend 
their money to reach fewer and fewer numbers. These papers will go out 
of business. If we turn off the news shows on radio and television that 
we find are biased and provide one sided coverage, the ratings will do 
them in.
<DD>
We don't need government. We need to match our outrage with 
the media with our willingness to continue to buy their product. That's 
all for Direct Line for tonight.

<h2>U.S. Inherits Soviet Traits</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Two recent incidents with two different airlines well illustrate how the United States is fast becoming a nation of bureaucratic rules rather than a nation of individuals empowered to make common sense judgments.
<dd>The other day I had to make a quick trip to Phoenix to address the annual meeting of the Arizona Transit Association. I chose Southwest Airlines out of Baltimore Washington International airport because that airline saved me literally four hours over the other choice I was given, was a United flight out of Dulles airport.
<dd>Southwest is a well-run and efficient airline with lower fares than all of the competition.
<dd>Somehow they have managed to get in and out of interim terminals in 20 minutes while their competition takes at least an hour. The only problem with Southwest is that in order to keep costs down they always seem to have the last gates in any given terminal concourse. Gates are usually auctioned off and Southwest wants to pay the lowest price possible in order to keep their fares down.
<dd>As some viewers know, I broke my back early this year and am held together by 16 metal parts. I am very blessed to be walking at all. I can now walk reasonably well but when I have to carry a bag it is quite difficult. I had only one bag when I arrived at BWI. When I got through the security system, which at BWI now requires that hand carried bags be unpacked and searched, I asked if there was an electric cart to take me to gate 16 at the very end of the concourse. I was told that Southwest did not operate such carts, whereas other airlines on other concourses did. They do need to cut costs to keep the fares low. So I managed to walk carrying my bag to the end of the terminal. I wanted to check in early because on Southwest, there is open seating. Southwest doesn't serve real food and this was 1 p.m. so I wanted to get something to eat, but the cafeteria was half way down the concourse. So after I received my boarding pass, I asked the gate attendant if I could leave my bag with him, explaining my circumstances. Southwest is known for its cheerful, even funny employees. Not this fellow. He literally growled at me, &quot;Your bag has to be attended at all times.&quot; I replied, &quot;yes and if you keep it, it will be.&quot; Then he really got surly. &quot;You have to keep your bag with you at all times,&quot; he barked. So off I went carrying my bag. When I got to the cafeteria, the arrangement was such that I could not set it down anywhere and keep an eye on it. So I carried my bag and a tray at the same time. Unfortunately carrying both elevated was more than I could handle and some of the contents on the tray ended up on the floor.
<dd>The second incident involved a United flight out of New York. We pulled away from the gate and onto the runway, whereupon the pilot came on and said, &quot;We're sorry folks, we are 18th in line and because of the weather, take-offs are very slow. We will be here at least a half hour.&quot; The man across the aisle from me summoned the stewardess. He told her, &quot;I almost missed this plane. I didn't have a chance to get to the bathroom and I was counting on going after takeoff. I need to get to the bathroom.&quot; She told him emphatically, &quot;You must stay in your seat while we are on the runway.&quot; He asked again: &quot;Please, this is really an emergency. I am not feeling well.&quot; She got very agitated for no good reason as the gentleman was as polite as could be. &quot;You stay in your seat and if you try to get up I will have you arrested,&quot; she told him. At that point other passengers around the man hissed and booed at her. I got her attention and told her, &quot;You know if this man is ill and suffers any damage as the result of your order he could sue you.&quot; At that point she threatened to have me arrested. Then just like the Soviet attendants on Aeroflot used to do before the collapse of the Soviet Union she stood in the aisle of the plane with her hands on her hips and shouted, &quot;I have complete authority to enforce FAA regulations. If anyone else objects I will get the police.&quot; The poor man was forced to sit there in agony for over 40 minutes until the plane was in the skies and the captain had turned off the seat belt sign.
<dd>In an earlier time, in both instances, an attendant would have been able to use his own judgment. To the Southwest gate attendant I had pointed out that my bag had just been completely unpacked and repacked and that he himself had removed the red tag indicating that the bag was okay. I don't think I exactly fit the profile of a terrorist. He should be allowed to make such judgments. Aboard the United flight the other passengers all assured the stewardess that if she let the man go to the bathroom, they would not ask for the same privilege. No, this &quot;lady&quot; wanted to play the role of the enforcer.
<dd>The irony is that on my last Aeroflot flight from Ulan Bataar to Moscow, the stewardesses were as polite and helpful as could be. They accommodated several unusual requests from passengers. They now have competition from Mongolian Air which is a superbly run U.S.-style airline using Boeing 737's.
<dd>Maybe the late Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov was correct. He predicted convergence between the Soviet system and ours. As far as I can see, the Russians are becoming more like the United States used to be and we are becoming more like the Soviets used to be, a land of mindless regulations where the individual counts for nothing.

<h2>
Strategic Control in the Hands of Liberal Senators
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>There has been a great deal of talk about how Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is leading the most conservative group of Republican Senators in at least 50 and maybe even 70 years.
<dd>True enough. And it is also true that there is only a small group of liberal Republicans left: Chafee (Rhode Island), Jeffords (Vermont), Specter (Pennsylvania), Collins and Snowe (Maine), with Warner (Virginia) and Gorton (Washington) and sometimes D'Amato (New York) falling into the moderate category.
<dd>By my count that leaves 47 votes ranging from moderate conservative to rock solid conservative in the GOP Caucus. I call that a pretty good majority, 47 - 8.
<dd>So the policies coming out of the Senate should be pretty good, right? In fact, most commentators have suggested that it will be the Senate which takes conservative initiatives now, not the House as it was in the 104th Congress.
<dd>Well, think again. Thanks to the new Senate GOP Conference Chairman Connie Mack having chosen Senator Slade Gorton (Washington) to chair the Committee on Committees, and thanks to only a two-vote margin of Republicans vs. Democrats on each committee, it is now the case that the moderate and liberal Republicans are controlling the show. They are strategically placed on each major committee so that all one of them has to do is to vote with the solid lineup of liberal Democrats and they can block anything positive from getting out of committee. In the case of the finance Committee, Senator Bill Roth (Delaware) is stuck with two such votes so this Committee Chairman, who is as solid as a rock on taxation issues, can't control his own committee.
<dd>That puts these eight Senators in control of the agenda. Either the Committee Chairman compromises with them or they vote with the Democrats and nothing happens. Of course a couple of them, Jeffords and Chafee, remain Committee Chairman themselves, thanks to a lack of fortitude on the part of any of the Conservative Senators to challenge them under the new rules of the GOP caucus. So in those cases, they can control what is even discussed in Committee. 
<dd>How a rip roaring majority of 47 can be outdone by eight is really an incredible development. Apparently Senator Mack (Florida), who had just been elected Conference Chairman, was just too naive to figure out what was happening. A good question is this: Since he is supposed to be such a solid conservative, how is it that, out of the whole group of 47, he managed to ask one of the group of eight to be in charge of the Committee selection process?
<dd>Unless the Senate leadership wants to now take the highly unusual step of initiating legislation from the floor instead of in committee, don't look for any positive, constructive pro-growth, pro-family measures coming out of the Senate. You don't have to worry about the Democrats filibustering such proposals. Heck, they'll all be killed in committee.

<h2>
Political Correctness and the Media
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>On the show "Ways and Means" Tuesday night, my colleague Bob Siegrist and I had as one of our guests Mr. Roderick Conrad of Project 21, the black conservative group. We were discussing the brutal attack by Congressman Clay of Missouri, the Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, on the just defeated black Republican Congressman Gary Franks. We asked Mr. Conrad twice what was driving political correctness in the black community and twice he replied, "the media" - an interesting answer.
<dd>Both Siegrist and I have been around long enough to have witnessed the profound change which has taken place in media circles which makes Mr. Conrad's answer the correct one. Mind you, most who populated the media were always liberal. But despite that they played by certain rules.
<dd>Siegrist's reporting career dates to the late 1930's, and mine to the late 1950's. Siegrist was once the celebrated prodigy of the powerful WGN radio in Chicago. Both of us worked for the Milwaukee Sentinel a decade apart. He wrote editorials. I covered local politics. About 31 years ago, I worked for Bob Siegrist as an editorial assistant. At the time, Siegrist had put together his own radio network to carry a daily commentary show. (Yes, Rush Limbaugh wasn't the first in the nation to do so). I was hired by Siegrist because he knew I generally agreed with his point of view. But I found out all too quickly that when it came to the copy I wrote for his show every day, he could have cared less about my opinion. He wanted facts. If I couldn't back up every word I wrote with cold hard data, I was in big trouble.
<dd>I mention all of this because even in this case, when I was hired because I had a point of view, I was expected to put that aside to help Siegrist deliver accurate information. When I was working for the Milwaukee Sentinel during the Goldwater campaign of 1964, the management made it clear that I was not to cover the campaign because of my political passion for the then Senator from Arizona. I sat across from Cy Rice, who did cover the campaign, and even though I heard his interviews and what he said privately afterwards, I never knew his political views and readers couldn't tell either.
<dd>That is the way it was back then and the way lots of people still think it is now. As recently as 1984, I received from one of the major daily papers in San Francisco an unsolicited letter of apology after running a tough piece written by one of its reporters. The reporter had soundly trashed a pro-family conference we were running there just prior to the Democratic convention of that year. The reporter turned out to be a homosexual activist who hated what we stood for. In the letter of apology, the paper's managing editor said he had not understood this when he assigned the reporter to cover us, and when he found out he removed the reporter from that assignment. The managing editor assured me we would receive fair treatment from there on out. We did.
<dd>That would not happen today. Whereas back then if editors found out you were involved with one group or the other, if they didn't fire you for such activity, they made it clear that you could not cover the activities of such a group. At the time I was an active journalist, black reporters  were not assigned to cover the civil rights movement precisely because editors felt they had an emotional stake in the coverage.
<dd>It is exactly the opposite today. Today homosexual reporters are deliberately assigned to cover the recent court decision on same sex marriages in Hawaii on the grounds that only they understand the feelings of that community and thus can give the correct picture of the impact of that decision. Black reporters cover the civil rights movement. That accounts for the astounding statement by Mr. Conrad that his organization, Project 21, which is the leading organization of black conservatives in the country, had yet to receive a single call from the national media asking for reaction to Congressman Clay's assertion that Congressman Franks had sold out his race because he didn't follow the liberal line. In today's media, if you are not a liberal woman, the assumption is that you cannot possibly comprehend the women's movement, so mostly radical feminist women today write about the so-called women's movement. That's why the white reporter for the Washington Times was told by the black principal and students at a Washington, DC, school to get her "white ass"  --  forgive the direct quote  --  out of the school. You see, in today's media no white person can possibly write accurately about the conditions of the oppressed blacks. Anyway, you get the picture.
<dd>Well, then, hearing all of this, you may think that things probably balance out because these same media outlets hire conservatives to cover the conservative movement and born again Christians to cover evangelicals. Wrong. That doesn't happen because from today's media perspective, what is happening in those movements is largely irrelevant. We are in what the New York Times has labeled "the post Christian era." As to conservatives and Republicans, even the back-to-back Republican control of Congress for the first time in 68 years is looked on as a temporary aberration on the inevitable road to resurgent liberalism, so why bother.
<dd>Siegrist and I were always a minority in our chosen profession. But it didn't matter as much then. True, it did effect what stories were covered. But once a decision was made to cover a story, even liberal reporters felt some obligation to cover the facts without getting caught up in the insider feelings of the moment.
<dd>No, what you are getting today, which passes for news and factual information, is beyond bias. It is a reflection of the agenda of those who are doing the reporting. That is why, more than ever, you need NET. We have an agenda too. But it isn't partisan. It is called telling the truth. Three years ago when we started NET, I was asked by Stone Phillips of NBC who was going to provide the balance in NET's coverage. I replied that we are the balance, and I said "we need a whole network just to balance out Bryant Gumbel." I haven't been back on the "Today" show since. That's just fine. I stand by my statement.

<h2>
Leadership in Lott
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
 <DD>Trent Lott was re-elected Senate Majority Leader
today by his fellow Republicans without any opposition. He leads
the most conservative group of Senate Republicans since, perhaps,
the 1920's.  Lott is a symbol of the changes in his own party.
He came to Washington as a Democrat. He served on the staff of
the late William Colmer, Chairman of the House Rules Committee,
and one of the last of the crusty old Conservative Democrats to
rule a House Committee with an iron hand.
<DD>
 Lott left Colmer to run for the House as a Republican
in 1972, the year that Richard Nixon swept the South. Ed Feulner
and I told Lott he was crazy for doing so. [Feulner, now the President
of the Heritage Foundation, back then was an influential House
staffer.] Lott could see already then what we didn't yet recognize
and that was that the Republicans were going to one day dominate
the South.
<DD>
 In 1980 when Ronald Reagan swept many new and conservative
Republicans into the House, Lott ran for and was elected House
GOP whip. He defeated Bud Shuster, the favorite of the GOP establishment
at the time. He held that position, largely in frustration, under
Bob Michel for eight years and finally opted to run for the Senate.
<DD>
 When in 1994 another large crop of freshmen Senators
was swept into office, Lott challenged then Majority Whip Alan
Simpson and defeated him by one vote. When Bob Dole resigned,
Lott faced off against his fellow Mississippian Thad Cochran and
beat him 44 to 8. Lott has never lost an election at home or in
the Congress.
<DD>
 It is clear that Lott knows when to hold 'em and
when to fold 'em. Two votes were added to Lott's majority in an
election which saw Bill Clinton sweep the nation. Not only that,
most of the incoming Republican Senators are more conservative
than the Republicans they replaced. The liberal wing of the party
is down to a few votes.
<DD>
 But the one thing Lott doesn't have which he had
when he entered the leadership in 1980 is conservative Democrats.
Lott became famous for being able to reach across the aisle to
get votes for Ronald Reagan's favorite programs. Conservative
Democrats trusted him. He may have changed parties but at heart
he was still one of them. Today when Lott looks across the aisle,
he finds almost no moderate to conservative Democrats left. Those
he could get from time to time in the last session, Heflin of
Alabama, Johnston of Louisiana, Exon of Nebraska, are all gone,
replaced either by Republicans or liberal Democrats.
<DD>
 In the Senate, even if Lott can keep his 55 Republicans
together on some votes, he still needs another five votes to break
a filibuster. Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle knows that and
will play it for all it is worth.
<DD>
 Lott is, when all is said and done, a wily Southerner.
He likes to make deals, but sometimes, when he feels a great principle
is at stake, he can be tough as nails. Following the Civil War,
Southerners learned to adjust. They learned to sound accommodating
even when they didn't intend to be. Lott is very much that way.
What you see and hear is not always what you get. And that often
surprises friends and enemies alike.
<DD>
Lott is the most clever GOP leader in the Senate
since the late Everett Dirksen passed on to his eternal reward
in 1969. He is a man who keeps his word once you can be absolutely
sure what his word is.
<DD>
Lott is someone who knows how to use power, but he
uses it very sparingly. He is often compared with former Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell. He likes the comparison. Mitchell
just smiled and smiled while he was driving a stake through the
heart of the Republicans. Lott wouldn't mind repaying the favor
from time to time.
<DD>
 Lott will have at his side a conservative team to
help him. That team reflects where the GOP has gone these past
years: Don Nickels from Oklahoma as whip; Larry Craig of Idaho
as Policy Committee Chairman; Connie Mack of Florida as Conference
Chairman; Paul Coverdell of Georgia as Conference Secretary; Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky as Chairman of the Senatorial campaign committee.
The South and the West, that is where Republicans tend to do well
and that is where the leadership team comes from.
<DD>
The Senate is a far different place than it was 30
years ago when I first encountered it. Half of the GOP membership
back then was liberal and Southern Conservative Democrats dominated
the structure.
<DD>
Trent Lott is truly a creature of the body which
he will lead for another Congress. As with the South itself, what
change comes about during his term will be incremental, steady
and managed. Trent Lott is no revolutionary but in terms of the
Senate itself, it is revolutionary that he is its leader.<BR>

<h2>
Clinton's Difficult Choice
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Poor Janet Reno. She can't win no matter what she does. Just a few days ago, the Republicans were singing the praises of the Attorney General calling her "honest and independent". That was because close aides of the President had been all over town telling anyone who would listen in the media that the President wanted to dump Miss Reno because she had been too willing to apply the independent counsel statute. Four times she had invoked that procedure regarding Clinton Administration officials and so there are that many high level investigations going on at the present moment.
<dd>The White House was especially concerned that the Attorney General would invoke the independent counsel statute in the matter of the foreign fund-raising practices of the Democrats, which became an issue in the final days of the 1996 campaign.
<dd>Well, whether the threat to her job was enough to get her attention, or whatever the reason, and at this point the lady deserves the benefit of the doubt, Janet Reno declined to invoke the independent counsel statute in the Democratic party fund-raising case. In her reply to Senator John McCain of Arizona, signed by a Deputy Attorney General, Janet Reno said one thing which is absolutely true and another which is highly questionable. First, she said that the statute itself was not designed to cover issues involving a political party, which is a private organization. True enough. But then the Attorney General went on to say that there is no evidence that either the President or Vice President has been improperly involved in the case (which, if true, would trigger the statute) and thus the investigation will be handled internally by the Justice Department and not by an independent counsel. But that statement misses the whole point.
<dd>We don't know what the role of the President and Vice President was in this episode. True, they both have denied any wrong doing. Richard Nixon also assured us he wasn't a crook. But it is essential to understand just what sort of influence foreign money paid in determining our government's policies. While Al Gore says he had no idea that a fund-raiser at a Buddhist Temple handled illegal contributions, (including several $5,000 contributions from Buddhist nuns who had taken a vow of poverty), the really suspicious activities involve the President himself. He met several times with Democratic fund-raiser John Huang, formerly with the powerful Indonesian conglomerate known as the Lippo group. In at least one case, U.S. policy toward Indonesia changed following one of those meetings. Maybe that was all just coincidence, but that, at least, is one huge question mark hanging over this matter.
<dd>So Senator McCain, (who had written Reno to ask her to invoke the independent counsel statute) and Majority Whip Don Nickles of Oklahoma, have both suggested that in view of Reno's decision, the Republican majority in Congress will just have to hold hearings on Democratic fundraising. That is entirely appropriate under the circumstances, because those hearings will put pressure on the internal unit at the Department to Justice to make its investigation honest.
<dd>Attorney General Reno did say that if the internal investigation warranted it, an independent counsel could always be appointed later. Maybe after the President reassures her that she will be retained during her second term she will feel more liberated to act.
<dd>The issue, in any case, is not going away. Now the Attorney General has earned harsh words from the same folks who had been lauding her  just days ago. It remains to be seen, however, if the White House aides who had been trashing her will now feel she has demonstrated sufficient loyalty to the President to be kept on the job. Bill Clinton has a big problem regarding Janet Reno. If he fires her, he will suffer great political damage because the assumption will be that she got the axe because she was too anxious to see his Administration investigated. On the other hand, if he retains her, he does run the risk of her rediscovering her independence because she retains considerable credibility with the media and the Congress and could easily recover from this temporary setback.
<dd>Yes, poor Janet Reno. The lady is not well physically and she has problems no matter which way she elects to go. It is Bill Clinton who deserves the real pity, however. He has a problem if he fires his Attorney General and he may well have a problem if he doesn't. It is for this reason that Presidents have always looked for close friends to put in that position. Janet Reno was Bill Clinton's third choice. They hadn't even met until he made the appointment. Maybe, considering all the trouble he is in, Bill Clinton really wants a close friend in the  Attorney General's office. Too bad Vince Foster didn't live to see this day. He might well have made the ideal Attorney General for Bill Clinton.

<h2>
Time to Reform the FDA
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Another in the long line of appointees of President Clinton is stepping down and in this case, not a moment too soon.
<dd>David A. Kessler will resign early next year as head of the Food and Drug Administration. Actually he was first appointed by President George Bush, but toward the end of the Bush Administration he signaled that he really was a Clinton supporter and Clinton kept him on as FDA Commissioner.
<dd>During his tenure, Kessler engineered several major power grabs which opponents contend are unconstitutional at worst or against the will of Congress at best.
<dd>Actually, Kessler's adventures against tobacco, widely embraced by Bill Clinton, is one of the key factors in continued Republican control in the House of Representatives. Although union and environmentalist money defeated many GOP incumbents in the North, Republicans picked up enough seats in the South to offset those gains and Republicans hung on to the House. Several GOP incumbents in the South and border states, thought originally to be in political trouble, all kept their seats due in part to the Administration's war on tobacco.
<dd>Kessler's departure comes at a time when Congress was beginning to take an increasing interest in his power maneuvers. There were signs that the 105th Congress was finally going to confront the FDA chief so Kessler probably thought it was a good time to get going. Former FDA General Counsel Peter Barton Hut said Kessler's unexpected announcement yesterday was "great news both for the FDA and for the public health." The FDA is "in the worst state of disarray in four decades," Hut said. The agency "now needs a real leader who will focus on the agency and not on their own personal agenda."
<dd>Indeed that is Kessler's legacy.
<dd>He greatly expanded FDA's power and in the process ran roughshod over the legislative process. The more controversial his actions became the more he seemed to enjoy the fight. Ralph Nader-style proponents of big government view him in heroic terms. Business concerns which were victims of his arbitrary and often capricious harassment view him as the devil incarnate.
<dd>As with all practitioners of power politics in Washington, he got a bit carried away with his own office. The Washington Legal Foundation just issued a report accusing Kessler of padding his expense account during his tenure. In truth, that may have prompted his resignation more than anything else. Better to leave now while some segments of the media and the public consider you a hero, then to fight charges which will tarnish your image and give opponents the opening they had longed for.
<dd>President Clinton has made noises about accommodating the realities of a Republican Congress by appointing more centrist people in his Administration. The FDA would be an excellent place to demonstrate his sincerity.
<dd>While Commissioner Kessler has used his time and energy to assume jurisdiction over products where he had no authority to do so, the United States has lagged way behind the rest of the developed nations of the world in approving new life-saving drugs. It is a travesty that U.S. citizens now have to travel abroad to seek medical treatment deemed safe in Europe and Japan but not available here. The poor, which Kessler and his friends always claimed they were championing, cannot afford to go abroad for treatment. They have been left to die untreated here at home. Kessler was bold in seeking new power, but extraordinarily timid in taking action to save the lives of U.S. citizens.
<dd>Congress should now pass legislation to reform the agency to force it to function as it was set up to do. The FDA  ought to swiftly test and put on the market new products that further the health of the nation. The FDA ought to get out of those areas where Congress has not given it jurisdiction.
<dd>The President, for his part, should look for someone sensible to head the agency. Kessler, for all of his great public relations, has actually succeeded only in tying up the agency with various lawsuits which will take years to settle. Those law suits can be put behind us if the President will make the right appointment. Bill Clinton won't appoint any conservative to office, but he doesn't have to appoint a power-mad ideologue either.
Now we will get a chance to see if Bill Clinton wants to behave as a "New Democrat," at long last, or if he intends to replace Kessler with another headline-seeking Commissioner with his own agenda. That choice, which is bound to be given significant scrutiny by the Congress, will tell us a great deal about Bill Clinton's plans for a second term.

The Speaker's Profound Remarks
</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>
Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who was approved by his party caucus for another term as leader of the House of Representatives, said something very important which got little coverage yesterday. The media was busy talking about the Speaker's pledge to cooperate with President Clinton and his acknowledgment that he had made some mistakes.
<P>
<DD>
Yet of far more profound significance were these words by Speaker Gingrich:
"The country will never again be healthy if we don't have the courage to confront the spiritual and cultural and moral deficit that is an even greater threat to our future than the economic deficit.
<P>
<DD>
"In the core documents of our freedoms, the Declaration of Independence, is says unequivocally, we are 'endowed by Our Creator with certain unalienable rights'. And I think we have an obligation to reassert in a calm, open way, involving people of all backgrounds, each approaching God in their own unique way, that this nation comes from God, that it is in fact only successful when it is submissive to God's will, that while all of us are sinners and all of us fall short, that does not excuse any of us forgetting where our powers and our responsibilities come [from]; and somehow reestablishing in the public square that it is legitimate, in fact it is vital, that we recognize the degree to which, in the broadest sense, if America does not get its rights from Our Creator, there is no explanation of America and there is no way of thinking of the future. 
<P>
<DD>
"I am not suggesting here in any way a state religion. I'm not suggesting in any way a theocracy. But I am suggesting to you that if you read Lincoln and you read the Founding Fathers and you read as recently as FDR, and then you look at our modern 30-second attack commercials and you look at the decay in our society, that maybe we lost a great deal when we became too timid to talk openly about the source of the American dream and the source of our rights and that we have an obligation to re-establish them."
To this I can only add "Amen and Amen." It is a mark of our time that the Speaker feels he would have to add as many qualifiers as he did in making a very valid statement. The early leaders of our nation were much more straight forward in proclaiming their belief in God.
<P>
<DD>
Important civil documents invoke the name of the "Most Holy Trinity." The argument then was between those such as Thomas Jefferson, who acknowledged a distant deity and those who proclaimed that we were a Christian nation, albeit one which was tolerant of other beliefs.
<P>
<DD>
Today the argument is between those who want only to acknowledge God in the public square, as the Speaker did in his speech, and those who insist that belief in God is at most a private matter, and any utterance or acknowledgment of God in the outside world is not only improper but should be forbidden. Unfortunately, in what the New York Times has described as the "post-Christian era in America," those who want not to separate church and state but to ban God from government, have won the day.
<P>
<DD>
Viewers know I have many differences with the Speaker. But I applaud him for raising this issue. He did so on the day on which his father, Robert Gingrich, who had adopted him at age three, died of cancer at age 71.
<P>
<DD>
The words of Speaker Gingrich were a fitting tribute to the only father he ever knew. There is something that happens to us when our fathers die. We begin to look at life more seriously. Somehow when they are still alive, we think of ourselves still as kids, no matter how old we or they may be. But when we lose our fathers, we understand that the future now is up to us. We take responsibilities more seriously.
<P>
<DD>
I believe in the Providence of God. I believe nothing happens by accident. The Speaker said with the passing of his Dad, he felt strongly that he had to bring up the issue of God in the public square, even though it might be a little controversial. I believe he was inspired to do so. The Speaker spoke the truth.
<P>
<DD>
Let us ask Almighty God to find rest for Robert Gingrich in a place where there is no pain nor grief but only everlasting life. Let us ask that same God to inspire and bless Speaker Gingrich that he might find the wisdom and strength to do exactly what he suggested needs to be done: namely to help to reestablish God's rightful place in the affairs of mankind.

<h2>
The Declining Conscience of America
</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>
Those who watched this program regularly earlier this year may recall that when President Clinton vetoed the Partial Birth Abortion measure, I predicted that this would be the high water mark of his administration. That act, I suggested, would bring about his defeat in the Fall. It is true that Clinton, who at that moment enjoyed a 56% approval rating, the highest of his Presidency for more than a day or two, never did achieve that high water mark again. But it is not true that this issue made a controlling difference in this election. 
<p>
<dd>
The liberal columnist Mark Shields, also host of CNN's Capital Gang, said today that post election survey data revealed that abortion was important to a much greater portion of the electorate than had originally been believed. Moreover, of those for whom abortion was deemed their most important issue in this election, Bob Dole defeated Bill Clinton two to one. So much for the myth that the so called pro choice position is an automatic winner with the electorate. It can be correctly argued that abortion did not effect the outcome of the Presidential race because Bob Dole refused to make it an issue. 
<p>
<dd>
Even when, in the final debate, a minister handed Bob Dole a soft ball question about the decline in morality in America, Dole did not raise the issue and gave President Clinton a pass. Unless voters went to one of the churches where pastors made this an issue or unless voters received mailings from the National Right to Life Committee, they probably were simply unaware that this was an issue. Indeed, another survey released last week revealed that among voters who followed and understood the issues, Dole was a decisive winner. 
<p>
<dd>
But among those who simply voted without following what was going on in the country, Bill Clinton won in a landslide. There were races, however, where the abortion issue became a principal focus. In Louisiana, retired Archbishop Philip Hannan declared that it would be a sin for Catholics to vote for Democratic Senate candidate Mary Landrieu because of her abortion position. What followed was days of discussion in the media about the separation of church and state, so that voters almost could not escape hearing about the issue. Since Louisiana has the greatest share of Catholics in the South, Hannan's statement was thought to be the death blow to Landrieu. But, barring the ability of Republican candidate Woody Jenkins to present evidence to the Senate of overwhelming fraud, Mary Landrieu will take her place as a Senator in January. Just a few years ago a statement such as Hannan made on abortion would have been a death blow to Landrieu. There is at least some evidence that Hannan's statement may have actually moved some Catholic voters to vote for Landrieu out of spite. 
<p>
<dd>
Likewise in Iowa, the race for the Senate against incumbent Senator Tom Harkin became, in the words of Congressman Jim Ross Lightfoot's campaign manager John Maxwell "a referendum on partial birth abortion". Lightfoot's initiative on the issue hurt incumbent Senator Harkin badly enough that it forced Harkin to air a television commercial accusing Lightfoot of distorting his record. Harkin claimed that he really was against partial birth abortion. That caused Lightfoot to air a commercial featuring a retired Catholic priest who looked like he stepped out of a Bing Crosby movie. The priest explained partial birth abortion and said Harkin had not told the truth when he said he was against it because he had voted to keep the procedure legal twice. Then the priest looked into the camera and said :'If Harkin would lie about this...." The commercial ended. It seemed to do the trick. Lightfoot came back up in the polls. But on the day before the election President Clinton came to Iowa and supported Harkin on the issue and Harkin went on to win the closest Senate contest against an incumbent. 
<p>
<dd>
But still Harkin won. So I was dead wrong about America. The Presidential race can be explained away. The Iowa and Louisiana Senate races cannot be. Yes, both were very close races. Yes there were many other issues involved. But abortion was front and center in both cases long enough for the electorate to make an informed choice. The electorate went for the candidate who supported near infanticide, the act of killing a baby by sucking its brains out moments before it is delivered from the Mother's womb. Because I thought America still had a conscience, I was confident that this issue would be decisive with voters. It was with some, but not enough.  
<p>
<dd>
I regret to say that I was wrong about this issue, not because I made a mistake. The Good Lord knows that I make lots of mistakes every single day. I regret that I was wrong not because the candidates I hoped would win lost. I regret to say I was wrong because of what it says about the American electorate. It tells me that no matter how brutal the crime, no matter how unconscionable the act, no matter how dire the consequences for the society, a majority of those who bother to show up at the polls will blind themselves to reality. That, my friends, does not bode well for the survival of our nation.

<h2>Public Prayer Launches Romanias New Era</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>
It was a scene worthy of a Cecil B. De Mille production. Thousands of people were gathered in University
Square early Monday morning in Bucharest, Romania, as Emil Constantinescu addressed them from a 
balcony overlooking the square. "I am here to tell you that I will never betray you. We are here for the people 
who fought the guns with their bodies," Constantinescu said. With that, the new President-elect of Romania 
asked the crowd to pray with him. Thousands of people dropped to their knees, bowed their heads and 
recited The Lord's prayer.
<DD>
Thus began a new era in Romanian history, the last of the Eastern European nations to shed the old 
Communist regime. At Christmas time in 1989, just after the Berlin Wall came down and following changes 
in other Eastern European nations, Communist Dictator Nicholas Ceaucescu was captured and executed. 
The man who gave the order for the execution was Ion Illiescu, who subsequently was elected and then 
re-elected President of Romania. He loosened some government controls of people's lives which Ceaucescu 
had imposed, but he kept his government in the hands of the Socialists. Almost no privatization. Huge heavy 
and unproductive industries still owned and operated by the government. Rampant inflation and a population 
which could scarcely get by.
<DD>
Illiescu was able to keep control with his own cleverness. His agents infiltrated the Democratic 
opposition and caused them to fight each other over the smallest of points. He inaugurated political parties 
with near identical names to those of the Democratic parties so that uneducated peasants would have trouble
 telling the difference. His tactic worked. His neo-Communist Socialists hung on for seven long years.
<DD>
Finally the Democratic opposition got its act together. Finally the voters caught on to who was really 
responsible for the terrible conditions in their country. It began earlier this year when anti-Communists swept
 municipal elections. Following that, in the November 3rd parliamentary elections, the Socialists were roundly
 defeated, leading to Sunday's runoff election for the Presidency. Romania has finally taken the step which 
everyone else in Eastern Europe took years ago.
<DD>
Bob Krieble and I and our team of political trainers were the first Western democracy specialists into 
Romania, just two months after Ceaucescu was killed. Candles were still burning day and night in the streets 
under mounted icons to commemorate those who were killed in the bloody exchanges culminating in the 
Dictator's death.
<DD>
Religious believers were still meeting secretly in apartments. There were no street lights at night. 
Neighborhoods took on an eerie feeling as people shuffled about in the dark. Streetcars rumbled through the 
city jammed with passengers, but with lights off. Foreigners were looked at with suspicion. I recall one lady 
approaching me in the back of an Orthodox church, speaking to me in German. I replied that I spoke English. 
She then asked me where I was from. I said America. She threw her arms around me and began to cry. 
"God Bless you for coming here," she said, surprising herself at her public display of emotions which 
attracted the attention of other worshipers in the now-jammed church. "You are the first foreigner I ever spoke 
to," she sobbed. "Two months ago, I would have been executed if I had spoken to you this way," she beamed. 
It was a scary place. Our meetings to teach the fractured opposition were infiltrated by the Communists.
<DD>
The opposition parties, then coming out of hiding after decades in the underground, were fixated on the past, 
each blaming the other for Romania's decades of suffering under Communism. Our pleas that they work 
together at first fell on deaf ears. But gradually the efforts to divide and conquer the opposition were 
recognized and overcome.
<DD>
To Bob Krieble's credit, we continued to do training there in the years to come, long after many others had 
given up and pulled out. Sunday that effort finally paid off.
<DD>
Romania followed Bulgaria, which had just elected an anti-Communist parliament a couple of weeks ago 
along with a pro-free market President as well. Now comes the hard part. Romania is so far behind, it will take
an extraordinary effort to catch up.
<DD>
In today's Washington Post, right next to the article about the developments in Romania, is a long article to 
the effect that the economic policies of Margaret Thatcher, 17 years after she first took office, are now finally 
paying off for Britain big time. Things are booming in the old British empire. But that took 17 years of 
uninterrupted rule by the Conservative party -- the same party which the voters seem poised to retire from 
office next year.
<DD>
Romania, in this new highly competitive atmosphere in Europe led by Britain, will find the going rough. 
However, the suffering people there kneeling in the streets praying to the Lord is an auspicious start. The 
situation may look on paper hopelessly complicated, but the Romanians know, with God all things are 
possible.

<h2>Dornan Will be Missed</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Congressman Bob Dornan called me yesterday afternoon to say that in the absentee ballot count, he had lost his race for re-election. Dornan contends that the election was stolen from him. Boxes and boxes of illegal ballots, he says, were brought in after the polls closed and the voters they supposedly represented were never matched with the voter rolls. Dornan says these are the votes of illegal aliens and he blames the Motor Voter act for making this sort of thing possible.
<dd>Dornan told me that the Republican party, which had pledged to help him go to the wall on this race, has now abandoned him when they realized that they would have to challenge Hispanic groups in the process. Some Hispanic groups have threatened to shut down the Congress if Dornan's opponent, Loretta Sanchez isn't seated. The GOP, he said, doesn't want this sort of confrontation, even if it means losing a seat in the Congress.
<dd>Bob Dornan will be missed. I first met him in 1975 when he was a talk show host in California and I appeared on his show. Ironically, Dornan called me earlier this year when one of the radio networks had approached him with a healthy contract to do a syndicated radio talk show. He has often filled in for Rush Limbaugh. Dornan asked me for my advice on this offer. I told him he should take it, because I was convinced that he would do more good on the outside than he could do on the inside, where he was constantly clashing with the Republican leadership. He did not follow my advice but instead ran for re-election. Now he hopes the network offer is still available.
<dd>Ever since bursting on the electoral scene in 1976, Bob Dornan has been a thorn in the side of liberals. The White House, for example, was thrilled yesterday when they heard that Dornan had gone down. For years Dornan has been on Bill Clinton's back on everything from draft-dodging to baby killing. In 1992 he made more speeches than George Bush warning the nation what the election of Bill Clinton would mean. Unfortunately much of what he predicted would happen has proved to be true.
<dd>Dornan served a total of eighteen years out of the last twenty, taking off a two year stint for an unsuccessful try at the United States Senate. In 1996 he ran for President, not because he ever thought he could win, but because he felt his presence would force the other Presidential candidates to address the social issues. Dornan was wrong about that and his poor showing and prolonged absence from his district were not helpful in his re-election bid. What also didn't help Dornan or others in California was the early declaration by all the media that Bill Clinton had won the Presidency while the polls were still open out there. That caused many Republican leaning voters to skip the election. The Democrats did turn out, but participation by voters in California was at an historic low.
<dd>Bob Dornan will be most remembered for his passion on the issues of the sanctity of life and on our national defense which earned him the nickname B-1 Bob.
<dd>He was always ready for a confrontation. It was Dornan who helped to convince Pope John Paul II to issue the declaration forbidding Catholic priests to hold civil office. That forced Congressman and Catholic priest Robert Drinan to have to retire from his Congressional seat. Dornan particularly disliked Drinan's politics because he felt his fellow Roman Catholic had betrayed his faith.
<dd>It was Dornan who was willing to confront the homosexual lobby. The pro-life movement has other passionate advocates, but no one else in the entire Congress of either party is willing to take on the homosexuals. Dornan did and they were among the groups working hard for his defeat in this election.
<dd>Dornan is from the Fidel Castro school of political rhetoric. He can give a two hour speech and never notice the time. Moreover, I've been present when he has done so with the whole audience sitting on the edge of their chairs hanging on every word. He is tough to follow on the podium, I can tell you from personal experience.
<dd>Perpetually disorganized, Bob Dornan's office always looked like a scene from the movies just as the Second World War concluded. Yet he always knew exactly where everything was.
<dd>Congressman Robert Dornan is above all else a man of his convictions. In an era when pale pastels seems to be the way to get elected, Bob Dornan's colors are blinding. He distinguishes himself from most of his colleagues because he actually believes in what he says.
<dd>Bob Dornan leaves a great void in the Congress. Lots of conservatives were elected last week, but not a one of them has the sort of passion Bob Dornan represented. In that sense, he belongs to another era when politicians, without the benefit of slick television commercials, actually had to excite people. That he does. You are either for him or against him.
<dd>Bob Dornan's voice in the Congress may be silenced but I can assure you, you haven't heard the last of him yet. Some radio network will be fortunate enough to employ him and when they do, it won't be long before the nation will be talking about him the way it now talks about Rush Limbaugh.
<dd>He is one of a kind. Without him in the Congress, we need to invent someone just like Bob Dornan.

<h2>Remaining Undecided Races</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>It has been a week since the voters have spoken but throughout the nation not all of the races have been settled yet.
<dd>Oregon supposedly adopted the most modern election system of all with its vote-by-mail operation. In the special election to replace the ousted Senator Bob Packwood, voters could cast their ballots over a three-week period. Well, that system wasn't in effect for this election, but the voters thought it was anyway. So over a third of the state's voters asked for and received absentee ballots. Come election night, officials could declare no winner in the contest to succeed retiring Senator Mark Hatfield. It took until last Friday night to determine that State Senate President Gordon Smith had won the election. Rep. Jim Bunn of Oregon had to wait still another day to find out he had lost his election.
<dd>Meanwhile in California, Rep. Bob Dornan has been hanging on by the skin of his teeth to the 233-vote margin he had on election night. Counting of absentee ballots is proceeding but election officials said they won't release the final results until tomorrow. Why on earth must it take over a week to count absentee ballots? Dornan now thinks there may have been tampering with these same ballots. He is toying with possibly seeking an injunction to keep the election records intact.
<dd>Up the coast in Washington state, not only the networks but also both parties have pronounced Rep. Linda Smith defeated in her re-election bid. The only problem with that is Smith is now leading as officials count the absentee vote. Her office contends there is no way she will lose the election. Meanwhile, in another Washington state district, Rep. Jack Metcalf, who was also pronounced as defeated by everyone, has narrowed the numbers between him and his opponent. If the that trend continues, there is some chance that he, too, could rise from the political dead.
<dd>Down in Louisiana, the canvass of all the precincts shows that Mary Landrieu has defeated State Rep. Woody Jenkins by 5,800 votes out of 1.7 million cast. However, Jenkins is morally certain that more than 5,800 fraudulent votes have been cast in that election. Proving it may be another problem. In Louisiana you sign a document when you register to vote and you sign another document when you actually show up to vote. If there is fraud, a comparison of signatures should do the job. Except that the Motor Voter law, on which Republicans acquiesced to President Clinton, makes those original signature cards, which used to be public documents, private documents. It now takes a court order to permit the Jenkins campaign to inspect the cards and there is no guarantee that the federal court will permit him to do so. If he fails in that attempt, he can ask the United States Senate to examine the election, but that would be unprecedented.
<dd>In Pennsylvania the recount is underway in the district where Rep. Jon Fox has held a 10-vote lead since election day. No one is alleging any fraud in that election. It was just an uncommonly close contest. Likewise, Rep. Peter Torkildsen of Massachusetts is hoping a recount will reverse his paper-thin defeat in that state's Democratic landslide. In these two races, the delay in the final results is justified because the results on election day were about evenly divided. But out on the West Coast, the delays in reporting the results are indefensible. In all three states where I have lived, absentee votes are counted on election day itself and simply added to the total, precinct by precinct. That way both candidates and voters know the results when the totals are reported. True, an election here or there can be so close that a recount must take place before a winner is certified. That happened in the Virginia Senate race of 1978 when John Warner finally emerged the winner by 4,000 some votes. But at least the preliminary totals were known on election night itself. This is all a matter of state regulation and it seems to me those West Coast states would do well to get with the rest of the nation in the way they count their ballots.
<dd>What has happened in Louisiana, however, is quite distinct from the other contests. The Jenkins campaign has been gathering evidence that gambling interests, which had several ballot propositions at stake in that election, spent money illegally to bus voters to the polls, which is not permitted by Louisiana law. Moreover these same gambling interests distributed ballots to those they recruited to vote. The ballots had Mary Landrieu's name on them, which is a likely violation of the law forbidding corporations to participate in federal elections. Jenkins has been an outspoken opponent of gambling in Louisiana. The most outrageous aspect of all of this is the open invitation to fraud which the Motor Voter law has brought about by not making the original registration signature cards available for public inspection. Former Congressman Rick Tonry was elected in that state in the 1970's when corrupt precinct officials added to the tally many of those who had registered but had not shown up to cast their ballots. When the voting records were examined, Congress vacated the seat and ran a new election and Congressman Bob Livingston was the victor of an honest count. In a state with that sort of history, cheating on elections should be made more difficult, not shielded by federal law. Regardless of the ultimate outcome of that cliffhanger, the law there must be changed to make the sort of outcome we are now dealing with in Louisiana impossible to ever happen again.
<dd>If in this day and age elections can still be stolen with ease, then our system of government isn't safe. Who is to say how many Senate votes decided by a margin of one would go the other way if an election had been honest instead of corrupt. The whole nation has a stake in the outcome in Louisiana.

<h2>Speaker Should Step Down Temporarily</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Oklahoma's just re-elected Congressman Steve Largent has suggested that Newt Gingrich step down as Speaker of the House temporarily until ethics charges against him are cleared up. Gingrich has rejected the idea. 
<dd>Let me say at the outset that I believe that Gingrich will be exonerated from these charges. I have said so from the beginning. I continue to believe that.
<dd>But let me tell you why I think Largent is right when he argues that Gingrich should step aside for the time being.
<dd>One of the most important issues facing this Congress is how to handle the many scandals of the Clinton Administration. If Republicans go after Clinton in what is perceived to be too partisan a manner, they will end up getting into trouble with the voters. On the other hand, the charges against Clinton, unlike those against Gingrich, are serious. Many, especially the recent questions about campaign contributions by foreigners in exchange for subtle changes in US policy, are extremely troubling and could add up to real trouble for the President and his Administration.
<dd>Gingrich has a problem. From the time he took office and defended a multi million dollar book deal to the collapse of his no exit strategy on getting President Clinton to agree to Republican proposals on the federal budget, Gingrich has not fared well image wise with the American public. Add to this the hundreds of millions spent by the unions and others to attack Gingrich, and what we have is a weakened Speaker of the House. Granted, the Democrats do not control the Congress. But the margin is very close. A tarnished Gingrich will have problems upholding the Republicans as ethically sound while he weighs in against the many problems of the Clinton Administration. 
<dd>By stepping aside temporarily as Largent suggests, Gingrich would pave the way for himself to return stronger than ever. In effect, he would wipe the slate clean of his previous problems with the American public.
<dd>I know that would be a tough decision for the Speaker to make. His position is that since he believes he is innocent, there is no reason for him to do this. 
<dd>But think about it for a moment. Gingrich steps aside with an agreement that the investigations against him will be completed by a time certain. He says he is so certain of the outcome that he is willing to take this action so that the American public will have confidence in him and the Republicans when he is vindicated. 
<dd>This action contrasts with Bill Clinton. All we have heard since the election out of the Clinton Administration are rumors about trying to remove Janet Reno as Attorney General. Trying to find  a way to get at Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr. Clinton himself says he wants to go after his political enemies who have made Whitewater and other matters an issue.
<dd>Bill Clinton isn't going to be willing to step aside until he is vindicated of charges against him because, as he well knows, he is not likely to be vindicated. 
<dd>This Administration has been brilliant, however, at deflecting its own problems. Their rule is to attack the attacker. So if Gingrich makes any statements, as he did toward the end of the campaign, about the many serious charges pending against Clinton and his associates, spokesmen for the President will simply say that Gingrich has no right to make such charges when his own house isn't in order. 
<dd>While Harold Volkmer is gone, David Bonior is very much alive. The Gingrich inspired campaign to defeat him failed miserably. Bonior is going to be back full tilt in the 105th Congress. 
<dd>I believe that Steve Largent has suggested a course which is actually best for Speaker Gingrich and the country as a whole. It will enable Gingrich to seize the moral high ground. Assuming I am correct that Gingrich will be vindicated, he would take a short step backward to take a much larger step forward. If cleared of these ethics charges, he would return to the Speakership then with the ability to take on the Clinton Administration without their capacity to point to Gingrich as a way of shielding themselves.
<dd>But, you say, Congressman Bonior and his ilk would just file more charges as soon as the Speaker returns. That is , of course, possible, although Gingrich in the second half of the 104th Congress hasn't gone to the bathroom without checking with the ethics committee first. Yes, Bonior might file more charges but if the Speaker was willing to step aside and was subsequently vindicated, he would show those charges for what they are: pure politics and a payback for his having gone after Democratic Speaker of the House Jim Wright. 
<dd>I am sure that that the initiative Largent took has made Gingrich either hurt or angry. The Speaker should rise above his feelings. Largent has actually suggested a way for Gingrich to restore his moral credibility with the nation.

<h2>Drunkenness at the Helm of Foreign Policy</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>Back in the Cold War days, political leaders routinely saw blocks of nations dividing the international landscape. In those days our heads of state worked hard to maintain a balance between opposing forces: the Communist world and free world; the East against the West; Russia and China verses the United States.
<dd>Apparently, many of our citizens have forgotten the struggle that gave us the Iron Curtain, mutual assured destruction, and communist subversion within the U.S. counterculture.Today a new set of opposing forces has gathered with little notice in the press. 
<dd>While the U.S. is still the dominant force for freedom and democracy, that course is uncertain as we approach the 21st century. Much of the problem rests with an outdated world perspective upon which our elected leaders and appointed officials presuppose our nation's foreign policy. The Administration and its State Department still see the world as a collection of nations divided according to geography. Stabilization, democracy, and now environmental unity are the altruistic goals of the 90s.
<dd>Unfortunately the world has become far more complicated than the two-dimensional map would suggest. Like the Cold War, a serious division has emerged. This time the battle lines have been drawn between opposing cultures, one of which has become united behind a religion whose logical conclusion is world dominance.Unwilling to recognize this, Washington is squandering our nation's military and economic preparedness, by allowing our future to become steadily drunk at the international saloon of the United Nations and its appeasement politics. <dd>Drunkards slur their speech; our foreign policy experts make vague pronouncements. Drunkards are make fools of themselves; America's foreign policy leaders have disgraced their country. Drunkards are slow to react to sudden danger; America's foreign policy drunkards scarcely see what is happening in the world around them: leaders of the modern Islam have declared war on our society.
<dd>Islamic cultural leaders are committed to the ultimate destruction of the United States, which they call the Great Satan. It is a holy war, or jihad, as they call it. The generals of this war have constructed an unlikely alliance with China and Russia. Remember, Communist China still hates the U.S.  Also, half of Russia's population are anti-West and would willingly return to life as a communist nation. Over the past several years, these two nations have helped arm key Islamic client states, such as Syria, Iran and Iraq.Foreign policy inebriation is nothing laughing matter. 
<dd>Our nation cannot remain silent while its elected leaders and their appointees wile away our future and sacrifice our safety, passed out in the UN saloon. As citizens, we must demand from our government the thing our government has no right to possess. We must demand that Washington give America back to the people before it is too late.

<h2>An Examination of Election Results</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>Some random and hopefully not too disconnected thoughts about yesterday's elections. 
<DD>First, we had the lowest voter turnout since the Presidential election of 1924 when the Democratic nominee John Davis was actually more conservative than the Republican incumbent Calvin Coolidge. Those who wanted change opted out. It says a lot about our system when half of those who registered have declined to participate. Candidates of both parties failed to address the real concerns on the minds of the American people. Both parties are on life support systems, but, as if often the case, neither recognizes it yet.
<DD>Second, the big loser in this election was organized labor. They spent a minimum of $200 million to try to buy the Congress and it didn't work. Some of the money which was spent was spent illegally. That needs to be investigated.
<DD>Third, coming out of this election will be a big push for Common Cause-style campaign reform. If the Congress is foolish enough to pass such a bill, it will only make a bad system worse. Yes, we need to get foreign money out of politics. But as far as American citizens are concerned, we need to deregulate the process, not make it more difficult for candidates to comply with cumbersome laws.
<DD>Fourth, the caucuses of both parties in Congress in both Houses will be further apart as the result of the election. Republicans in this Congress are more conservative. It is hard to find liberal Republicans these days. It is equally hard to find conservtive Democrats. The Democrats in the Congress are more liberal.
<DD>Fifth, Bill Clinton may, in due course, wish he had lost. Investigations of wrong-doing in the Administration will continue and this time the Republicans will have their act together a bit better. Moreover, the bills are now going to come due for Bill Clinton from organized labor, the enviornmentalists and the radical lifestyle community. He will have to pay up or risk losing his base. But when he pays up, he will be perceived as moving to the left. That, in turn, will strengthen the Republicans in the next election, known as the six-year-itch election.
<DD>Every six years of a Presidential cycle where one party keeps the Presidency for eight years in a row produces a six-year reaction of great proportions. FDR caught it in 1938. Truman in 1946, Eisenhower in 1958, Johnson in 1966, Reagan in 1986. The last two years of the Clinton Administration, if he survives that long, may turn Clinton into the all-time lame duck.
<DD>Sixth, some of the non-Presidential and Congressional results may be, in the long run, more significant. The California Civil Rights initiavtive was passed handily, dealing a blow to affirmative action programs. Look for similiar initiatives elsewhere in the USA , which may even force the leadership of the 105th Congress to act. Meanwhile, Tax limitation initiatives passed nearly everywhere. A unique term-limits measure passed in nine states and may even yet pass in two others. If upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, this particular measure may finally be the key to winning the term-limits issue at the national level. If a district votes in favor of term limits and the Congressman disregards the voter's wishes, that information would be right there on the ballot the next time that Member of Congress came up for election.
<DD>Seventh, Speaker Newt Gingrich, who became the whipping-boy of the liberals, can take some comfort in the defeat of Harold Volkmer in Missouri. While David Bonior was very strident, Volkmer became a pathalogical opponent of the Speaker's. Volkmer will not be back next year. Gingrich will be. But all the power he managed to get the Republican caucus to cede to him at the beginning of the 104th Congress may not be appropriate for him as he tries to govern his reduced majority in the 105th Congress. He may be forced to give back some of that power to his colleagues to keep the ship together. By the way, the GOP loss in the House which will be anywherefrom 7 to 10 seats, compares very favorably to pick-ups for Presidents being re-elected to a second term. Ronald Reagan, in winning his landslide in 1984, gained 14 seats in the House.  
<DD>Finally, while there were some excellent men and women who were elected to Congress yesterday, there were few known leaders. We suffer so greatly for lack of leadership. Maybe the Lord will see fit to raise a few of them up to help lead this nation back to sanity.

<h2>Election Results Seldom Meet Expectations</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>In some locations in the nation, the polls are about to close, in others the polls will be open for another four hours yet, but soon enough we will know the verdict of the American people in this election.
<dd>Whatever the outcome, it is good to keep this election in perspective. Every two years I hear several people say, "This is the most important election we have ever faced in our history." Usually they cite some burning issue of the day as their reason for feeling that way. It is true that elections have significance, but usually that significance is not as profound as we think. When FDR was returned to office with a landslide and the Democrats actually gained seats in Congress for the fourth election in a row, FDR thought he could get whatever he wanted. He proposed packing the Supreme Court which had ben resistant to some of his initiatives. Yet it was that very Congress, where FDR's opposition had been reduced to next to nothing, which stopped his court-packing scheme.
<dd>My first election in which I was active in a major way was 1958. I was by then the youngest member ever to serve on the Board of the Young Republicans of Racine, County, Wisconsin. That year, we got wiped out by the explosion of the AFL-CIO's Committee on Political Education or COPE. The Democrats won huge majorities in the Congress. Yet that Congress produced little of what the Democrats wanted. All of President Eisenhower's vetoes were upheld. He actually was a better President with that Congress than he had been when he was dealing with a much friendlier Congress. In fact, that Congress -- which was practically owned by big Labor -- passed the Landrum Griffin Labor Reform act over the strident opposition of the very Members of Congress who had been elected to stop it.
<dd>It is true that in 1964, then Conservative Republican candidate Barry Goldwater got crushed by Lyndon Johnson and the Congress which followed gave us all of the dreadful Great Society legislation we are still trying to cope with today. But also out of that election was born the modern conservative movement which produced Ronald Reagan, first as Governor of California and then as President.
<dd>The Democrats again crushed the Republicans in 1974 and some of my friends were suicidal. Yet that Congress upheld all but one of President Ford's vetoes. By the way, in my three decades here, the two least damaging Congresses were the Congress elected in 1966 and the Congress elected in 1978. Both anticipated the election of Republican Presidents and the Republicans finally got their act together and held off just about everything that was destructive.
<dd>Expectations were high for the Congress which came in with Ronald Reagan in 1980, and indeed the first eight months of the Reagan Administration were exciting and did good things. After that, it was back to more of business as usual. By the second session of that Congress, the largest tax increase in history, up until Bill Clinton's tax bill of 1993, was passed and signed into law by Reagan.
<dd>The election of Bill Clinton with a Democratic Congress in 1992 was very troubling. Yet many bad initiatives were stopped by that Congress, some of which were passed by the Republican Congress which followed it. Expectations were never higher than two years ago. The first few months of the 104th Congress were terribly exhilirating. But that Congress too left town with a whimper with most of its urgent business left undone.  My point is simply this. Whichever way this election goes tonight, it will be neither as good nor as bad as contemporary observers believe it will be. If Bill Clinton gets back in with a Democratic Congress, probably a united and outraged Republican opposition may get its act together. On the other hand if somehow the voters deft the odds and elect Bob Dole with a Republican Congress, true believers out there who think the nation has now been saved will be disappointed. We may, in fact, get mixed results. I have come to believe that the American people do that by design. They give us a President of one party and a Congress of the other because in their minds less damage will be done that way, and sometimes they are correct.
<dd>What is important, in the long run, is not this particular election. What is important is that we begin to face our real problems as a nation. These are not the problems which were ever talked about by the major candidates in this election. They are the sort of problems being discussed by my colleagues Bill Lind and Brad Keena on the "Next Revolution." Sooner or later elected officials will be forced to face those problems. Let us fervently pray that at that moment in our nation's history, there will still be time.

<h2>Politicizing a Murder</h2>
<p>
Direct Line Commentary<br>
by <b>Marianne Lombardi</b>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>President Clinton is pretending
to be tough on crime and has taken to exploiting the murder of
12-year old Polly Klaas in order to get re-elected.  <dd>In a television
ad, narrated by Polly Klaas's father, Mark Klaas, he praises President
Clinton for forcing Congress to pass his tough crime bill.  He
goes on to say that the recent attacks on Clinton's character
are just politics and claims the President's character is evident
in his courage to protect children.  <dd>All politicians exploit tragedy
to get elected - Republicans used paroled murderer Willie Horton
as their example of how Michael Dukakis was soft on crime.  Now,
Democrats are doing it to show how Bill Clinton is tough on crime.
<dd>It is an election year, and we should expect nothing less from
any politician - if Mark Klaas were a Republican, I'm sure we'd
see him in a Bob Dole ad.  But the Clinton campaign has gone too
far in using Mark and Polly Klaas to counter Bob Dole's attack
on Clinton's character.  The truth is, Bob Dole has done nothing
that even resembles an attack - he has barely scratched the surface.
<dd>There is so much material fact on Clinton's lack of honor and
morality that this campaign has missed, that the Clinton campaign
would be better off not responding at all.  To top it off, Bill
Clinton is far enough ahead in the polls that there was no need
to even mention the word character. I have to admit that I have
a personal sadness when I see a grieving father embrace an administration
that has done nothing to prevent crime.  In fact, it has encouraged
crime by putting drug prevention on the back burner, putting lenient
judges - anti-death penalty judges - on the bench for life, and
by trying to outlaw ownership of guns by law abiding citizens.
<dd>But Mark Klass is an adult and he is free to endorse whichever
candidate he chooses.  I just don't have the faith that he is
getting all the facts.

<h2>Dole's Record Solid on Judges</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>I keep having people come to me asking the same question: "Give me one reason I should vote for Bob Dole for President," they ask. Okay, I'll give you a reason: The federal judiciary.
<DD>To date President Clinton has appointed 202 federal judges and 26% of the federal judiciary overall. His future appointments will even more dramatically shift the balance of the federal bench because the percentage of his activist appointees replacing more restrained Bush/Reagan appointees has steadily risen from 14% in 1993 to about 25% in 1995. That number will continue to rise because instead of activist Clinton judges replacing activist Carter judges, they will be replacing more restrained judges appointed by Presidents Reagan and Bush. Whatever you may think of George Bush, by the way, his federal judge appointments were overall slightly better than those of Ronald Reagan.
<DD>13 judges have already announced that they will take "senior status."  132 district court and 42 appeals court judges will be eligible to take senior status by the end of a second Clinton term. So Bill Clinton's appointees could comprise almost 60% of the federal judiciary and a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court if he has a second term in office.
<DD>Let me give you a few examples of the judges Bill Clinton has already managed to get on the court. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, regarded as "moderates" by Clinton standards, voted against single sex education, voted to block a ban on quotas for homosexuals, voted to require discrimination against religious expression, voted to allow race preferences in government, voted to allow the creation of racially segregated congressional districts, voted to block the voters wishes to have federal term limits and have voted to empower the federal government to regulate virtually every aspect of the economic life of the country.
<DD>This is just a sample of the sort of people Clinton has put on the court. Judges Blaine Michael and Diana Motz voted against excluding homosexuals from the military. Judge Carlos Lucero voted to declare a city seal with a cross unconstitutional, Judge Theodore McKee voted to abolish student-led graduation prayers. Judge H. Lee Sarokin argued that prison inmates have a constitutional right to receive mail uninspected by prison officials. Judge Martha Daughtrey voted to throw out drug and child pornography evidence. Judge James Beaty voted to overturn a double murder conviction because a juror had driven past the house where the murder took place. And so it goes. I could go on and on but you get the picture.
<DD>The same goes for those Clinton appointees left hanging when the 104th Congress adjourned. Clarence Sundram supports the legalization of drugs. Margaret Morrow supports gun control and has an extensive record of feminist activism. Margaret McKeown helped to turn the American Bar Association toward its current pro-abortion position and was the lead counsel in homosexual rights litigation. William Fletcher believes there is a "discretionary Constitution" judges may use to legislate from the bench. And believe me it would only get worse in a second Clinton term.
<DD>But, you may protest, Bob Dole voted for most of those Clinton judges. True enough because Dole supports the right of a President to pick judges as he wishes. He expects the same treatment from the Senate if he gets the chance to pick judges. Nevertheless, an August 1996 report by the Judicial Selection Monitoring project of the Free Congress Foundation gave Dole a 100% score. The tally included votes on 20 closely-divided, controversial judicial and Justice Department nominations. Each of the nominations chosen for the report presented a genuine choice between judicial activism and restraint. On each vote, Bob Dole chose restraint.
<DD>Now does that guarantee that all of Bob Dole's judges will be judges we would approve of? No it does not. President Bush made a concerted effort to pick good judges and wound up with David Souter on the Supreme Court. But that is because he took the word of his then Chief of Staff John Sununu who insisted that Souter was a judicial conservative. The former right wing Governor of New Hampshire Meldrim Thompson agreed with Sununu and said he would stake his career on Souter being conservative. Both were wrong. 
<DD>I know from personal experience Bob Dole has always worked hard to confirm judges which the left fought hard against. Ask Dan Manion, approved by a single vote margin in the Senate for an appeals court seat. Ask Clarence Thomas, approved by only a four vote margin. Each prevailed despite overwhelming opposition from the Left, and thanks in no small part to Bob Dole.  Moreover Dole has proposed doing away with the role of the American Bar Association in the judicial selection process. The ABA is controlled by the liberals and has often shot down some of the better judicial nominees which Reagan and Bush sought to put forth.
<DD>Bob Dole has said that "the power of the courts to override the sovereign will of the people comes with a heavy responsibility, and must be used with the utmost restraint - without that restraint, judicial review becomes nothing less than judicial tyranny."
<DD>Over the next four years the president will likely decide several Supreme Court Justices and perhaps a third of all federal judges. I don't know about you, but I would rather trust someone who has Dole's philosophy than I would the current occupant of the White House to decide those appointments. Let's put it this way. We know what sort of federal judges Bill Clinton will give us. There is a fair chance that Bob Dole's picks will be a lot closer to what the founding fathers had in mind.

<h2>Schools Sending the Wrong Message</h2>
<P>
"Direct Line" Commentary<br>
By Special Columnist <b>Marianne Lombardi</b>
<P>
<br>
<DD>Lately it seems that America's schools are spending more time playing parent than teaching our kids how read, write, and spell. Schools all over the country are getting out of hand with their "It Takes A Village" mentality, confusing their role as educators with the role of parents, or acting fearful that one wrong move will bring on a lawsuit.
<P>Take for example the most recent news of Kimberly Smartt, the girl who was suspended for four months for taking a Midol tablet and giving one to a friend. The school claims that she violated the drug policy and is forcing her to pay for and undergo drug counseling. Kimberly, who is black, claims she is a victim of race discrimination and is suing the school superintendent, school principal and the county board of education. All of this over a drug that is as harmless as Tylenol and caffeine and a problem that could have been solved with one trip to the principal's office. What makes this situation more outrageous is that this very same girl could be given a condom or help in obtaining an abortion by the school without a blink of an eye.
<P>You may also remember the case in East Stroudsberg, Pennsylvania where 39 8th grade girls were given gynecological exams without their parents' consent. The school not only didn't think there was anything wrong with this, they actually argued that they were mandated by law to do it. No outrage on the part of the school there.
<P>And how about the schools around the country that are making it mandatory for students to volunteer as a requirement of graduation. Not just any volunteer work will do, it must be approved by the school and as you may have guessed, activities including religion or pro-life work is frowned upon or not allowed at all.
<P>What all of this means is that the liberal Department of Education and Hillary devotees are having an impact on our school system to the degree that education is now secondary. The schools know what's best for your child even if it defies common sense and violates your moral beliefs. Bob Dole articulated the first step in solving this problem the other night during the debate. When asked if he still supported abolishing the Department of Education, he said yes. What more needs to be said?

<h2>A Preview of a Union-Controlled Congress</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<DD>The U.S. Senate should have adjourned last night, but instead it is still in session because Senator Ted Kennedy and Senator Tom Harkin, two wholly-owned subsidiaries of organized labor, invoked arcane Senate rules to try to "exact one more pound of flesh for labor as we head out of here," as Majority Leader Trent Lott put it.
<DD>Kennedy and Harkin wanted a certain provision dropped from the bill which funds the FAA and other agencies. This provision would have corrected what is viewed as a mistake in legislation which passed the last Congress. That mistake had the effect of making it easier for unions to organize Federal Express. Senator Fritz Hollings, one of only few Democrats not owned by the labor unions, sponsored the rider which would correct the mistake and put Federal Express back on a level playing field with everyone else.
<DD>Kennedy and Harkin even caused the bill in question to be read to the Senate for hours on end. This hasn't happened in anyone's memory, but anything to please organized labor. Senator Harkin is up for re-election in Iowa and so confident of victory that he can afford to engage in such blatantly special-interest politics. By the way, 80% of Harkin's big war chest for his re-election comes from out of state, and most of that from the unions. No wonder he is doing their bidding. 
<DD>I mention this obscure moment in history because it is an illustration of things to come if the unions are successful in their quest for a change in who controls Congress. Already union bosses have a disproportionate influence over public policy way out of line for the number of people they now represent. There was a time, in the private sector, where unions had organized a third of the work force. In some states the unions were so strong that employers had to ask their permission before hiring anyone. Today union strength is at around 10% of the private sector work force and it is continuing to decline. Public sector unions are much stronger but even there big labor's grip has been loosened in some states with Republican Governors and legislatures.
<DD>The fact is that old fashioned unionism is out of step in our highly competitive society. The unions believe otherwise. Ask ValuJet. They began flying again yesterday after a three-month shutdown following the fatal crash in the Florida Everglades. While no one wants to cut corners on safety, the shutdown ordered by the FAA is unprecedented considering the type of crash. But ValuJet is non-union and the unions wanted the airline grounded. So, the FAA obliged, shutting down ValuJet even before investigators had determined the cause. Union lawyers are still in court trying to get an injunction to once again ground ValuJet. This argument is not about safety. ValuJet, with months of non-stop inspections and a good portion of its fleet not yet up and running, is probably the safest airline in the skies right now. This argument is about unions. If ValuJet can make a go of it with its highly attractive prices, the contracts the unions have negotiated with the other airlines come under great pressure. So it appears that the unions used their friends in the Clinton Administration to ground the airline. Unfair you say? Again, just a preview of coming attractions if the unions prevail.
<DD>And it does look promising for them. They are spending huge sums of money to defeat Republican freshmen and to win open seats. Republicans, who hoarded their money until these last weeks before the elections, are still not competitive. Meanwhile, the unions have pulled out all the stops, even to the point of deliberately violating federal election law, just so they can spend more money to buy the Congress. They don't care at this point. They are confident of winning.
<DD>Unions should have been out of business in the 104th Congress, yet they forced the issue of a minimum wage increase and the Republican Congress gave in. In fact anything objectionable to the labor unions was either killed in Congress, which didn't want the fight or was vetoed by President Clinton.
<DD>If the union bosses can get that much accomplished in the Republican 104th Congress, imagine what they can do with a Congress whose majority they have bought and paid for. This should be a hot issue in this election. But, alas, the union bosses have succeeded in intimidating the Republican majority who are now afraid to take the union bosses head on.
<DD>Go ahead. Tune into C-Span 2 and watch the union bosses at work through their surrogates Kennedy and Harkin and others. Then close your eyes and imagine the next session of Congress when these people could well be in the driver's seat. If that isn't enough to motivate you to get active in the electoral process, I don't know what will.

<h2>A Look Back at the 104th Congress</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>The 104th Congress whimpered to an end, a mere farthing of its former self. This is the 15th Congress I've had the privilege of witnessing from start to finish. In the past three decades, only this Congress and the 97th Congress, which came in with Ronald Reagan, actually seemed poised to pass positive initiatives for the American people. Each passed one truly significant piece of legislation. In the 97th Congress it was the Reagan tax cuts. In this Congress it was welfare reform. Each of those Congresses did pass other positive legislation as well. The 104th Congress may well be remembered in the future for the line item veto, but if Bill Clinton is President the next four years, that is not likely to be a positive memory.
<DD>Each Congress is also noted for having lost its nerve along the way. In the 97th Congress, that meant passing TEFRA, which up to that point was the largest tax increase in history. For this Congress, it was throwing in the towel in the attempt to kill all sorts of undesirable government programs.
<DD>Expectations were unreasonably high for this Congress. But then the American people had just caused one of the largest Congressional turnovers in modern history. They wanted to be heard through their representatives. The first few months were exciting. The House of Representatives passed item after item in the Contract with America. But the U.S. Senate broke the back of that momentum when it failed to pass a Constitutional Amendment for a balanced budget. Even though that amendment would not have been ratified instantly by state legislatures, it would have provided a framework within which Congress would have most likely operated. When that battle was lost, Congress then tried to pass a balanced budget through legislation. But when Bill Clinton stopped that and it was back to business as usual for the remaining session.
Except for welfare, this Congress never came to grips with the rest of the entitlements. It never tackled the crippling national debt we shoulder. It left much of the important work to the next Congress.
<DD>The freshmen Republicans, who came to Washington so determined to make a difference, found that they were unable to move their more senior colleagues who were not impressed with the election results. Now, most of those freshmen are seriously threatened for re-election. The unions are spending up to $2 million per Congressional district to defeat them. This doesn't include what the environmental groups, radical lifestyle organizations and the Democratic party itself is spending. When you hear that Republicans have more money to spend in this election than the Democrats, don't you believe it.
<DD>Despite GOP Congressional Campaign Chairman Bill Paxon's brave words, a number of these freshmen won't be back. Unfortunately for those that do return, the lesson they may learn from this could be that you can't tackle the Washington establishment and win.
<DD>Sunday night on PBS, Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott debated would-be Speaker Dick Gephardt and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle. I say debated. It was more like a friendly argument over who had indeed spent the most money for education and school lunches and who could better protect Medicare.
<DD>All of the passion which brought the Republican Congress to power was gone. There seems to be far too little difference between the two political parties. The differences seemed profound only two years ago.
<DD>For the 105th Congress, the American people need to send to Washington another crop of freshmen similar to the ones they sent in 1994. That seems less likely, however. This election is not being fought over the issue of freedom. Even though it is true, no one has made the case that the future of the very Republic is at stake this time around. In 1994, Republicans painted the big picture of the threat of intrusive government promoting radical ideas. That big picture is almost entirely missing from this election.
What a pity that Republicans lost their nerve. The folk lore here is that the government shut down was an unmitigated disaster for Republicans. I disagree. They were on the road to winning the issue when they caved in and they haven't recovered from that mistake since. 
<DD>We can only hope that in local races for Congress, absent the overarching theme, there are candidates who still believe that tackling the crippling problems of America the Bankrupt are important. Maybe we just aren't hearing about them back here. I fervently hope so. America does not need a 105th Congress less committed to sanity and true reform than this one was.

<H2>Watergate All Over Again</H2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>
Richard Cohen of the Washington Post is an honest but doctrinaire liberal. There is hardly an issue where he and I don't disagree. Recently, however, he reversed himself on the partial birth abortion issue because, he said, he was misled by the pro-abortionists who had claimed  incorrectly  that it was a rarely-used procedure.
<p>
But Cohen can usually be counted on to boost the liberal end of the Democratic agenda. That is why it was startling to read his column in this morning's Post in which he suggests that we might be on the verge of reliving history. The sort of history Cohen has in mind is Watergate, 24 years ago. Then, as he correctly points out, Washington was consumed with the Watergate story but out in the countryside it didn't mean a thing. Richard Nixon was overwhelmingly re-elected. Then the nation had to come to grips with the Constitutional crisis that followed.
<p>
What troubles Cohen and should trouble all of us is the reaction of the White House in the face of the latest report by the office of Inspector General of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Hillary Clinton was involved in an effort to deceive federal regulators into approving a sham real estate transaction, the report said. But the reaction of the White House is to attack those who have written the report. According to the Clinton White House, those who wrote the report were unduly pressured by Senator Al D'Amato, the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.
<p>
As to the other troubles visited on the Clintons, why, that is all the fault of the alleged partisan activities of Independent Prosecutor Kenneth Starr. Even Clinton himself has gone on the attack against Starr, echoing the complaint of Susan McDougal who says she'll rot in jail because Starr wants her to lie about the Clintons. Of course, this same Bill Clinton has hinted that he would not rule out a pardon for Susan McDougal and the others.
<p>
All of this has a familiar ring not just to Cohen but to the rest of us who were here in Washington at the time of Watergate. I cheered when then Republican National Chairman Senator Bob Dole told us that Watergate was just the product of the liberals being pushed by the left-wing Washington Post. "Tell it like it is, Bob," I thought as I watched Dole defend misdeeds at the White House. It turns out Dole had been lied to about the situation by Nixon and company so he was doing what he thought was right.
But the tactic is the same. When you can't explain your actions, blame someone else for asking the questions.
<p>
In the same paper in which Cohen's column appears there is a headline spread across page A-10 which reads "GOP Says White House Logs on Readers of FBI Reports have 6 Month Gap." Hmmm. Sound familiar? The 18 minute gap on a tape-recording just about sealed Richard Nixon's fate. But, of course, the Clinton White House blames their gap on a low-level aide named Mari Anderson, who just happens to be in hiding right now, unable to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Don't worry Mari. Congress is about to go out of session and then you can come out of hiding. After all, it's only five weeks until the elections and Bill Clinton's second term triumph. He'll take care of you and all the rest after that.
<p>
Yes, Cohen is exactly right. We have heard all of this before and it has an eerie ring to it. The fact is Richard Nixon's list of transgressions is minor compared with Bill Clinton's. If, in one narrative, you string together all of the problems this Administration has had, it is absolutely mind boggling. Yet the nation seems to care less. Things are going well. Unemployment is low. Inflation is stable. The stock market is high. We are all just fat, dumb and happy.
<p>
However, it is clear to Cohen and should be to the rest of the country that we may well be headed for the repeat of what happened in 1972: a Presidential re-election triumph and then a Constitutional crisis thereafter. No wonder the cartoon character Doonsbury, penned by the liberal but politically savvy Gary Trudeau, is preoccupied with Al Gore pretending to already be President. If this is indeed history repeating itself, then Gore ought to be President by 1998.
<p>
But wait a minute, folks. We are not the victims of some unstoppable historical forces. We have the power to make a difference. The clock hasn't stopped yet. We can still determine who wins in November. There is still time to wake up from the collective dream we Americans seem to be in to do something about this sorry mess before it is indeed too late.<p>

<h3>September 25, 1996</h3>
<H2>New Hope for the Senate</H2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>
As a follow up to a commentary of a couple of weeks ago, there is some good news to report. After we took on Senator Al D'Amato, the Chairman of the GOP Senatorial Campaign Committee, over the matter of his lack of support for Woody Jenkins, the endorsed GOP candidate in Louisiana, things began to happen.
<P>
Picking up that theme, Columnist Bob Novak wrote a column quoting this commentary and his piece ran in the New York Post. D'Amato got the message. Realizing that if the Louisiana general election ended up with two Democrats facing each other he would have it hung around his neck, D'Amato swung into action. The Senatorial committee began to poll to see which of the six GOP candidates had a chance to be in the runoff. They found, to their utter surprise, that Woody Jenkins was that candidate. Jenkins had built up a significant organization to the point where he scored in lower double digits even though most of his opponents had spent millions of dollars on television which Jenkins didn't have to spend.
<P>
Based on that data, D'Amato first tried to get other candidates to withdraw from the race. They would not do so. So, D'Amato got together with other GOP leaders in the state and one by one they agreed to support the candidate so that in the last week before the election, each day a different prominent Republican endorsed Jenkins. Four days before last Saturday's election, D'Amato then wired the Jenkins campaign about half of the money they could have given under the law so that Jenkins could, at the end, have lots of television and radio commercials. All of this created a surge effect. When the ballots were counted, Jenkins was not only in the runoff, he placed first among all the candidates. As a result, Republican Woody Jenkins will face Democrat Mary Landrieu, the daughter of the former mayor of New Orleans.
<P>
D'Amato called me to assure me that what happened was all part of the plan from the beginning. His own staffers assure me that it was not. But in any case, what happened worked. Now Republicans have a better than 50-50 shot at taking the Senate seat. In the primary, all the Republican candidates combined got about 58% of the vote. The Democratic candidates got 42% of the votes. Landrieu is on the far left of the Democratic party, although she is now trying to run as a moderate. Jenkins is the most solid conservative running for the U.S. Senate in the country. He is not backing away from his views at all. So we have a classic philosophical contest. Of course, the turnout in November will be far higher and right now Bill Clinton has a huge lead in Louisiana, but still Jenkins can be considered the slight favorite. 
<P>
What happened in Louisiana mirrors what has happened in just about all the states except in the East. Conservatives have been nominated for the U.S. Senate. Except for Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, the Republican nominees are good on the issues. 
<P>
The liberal mantra is that conservatives can win primaries but they will all be defeated in the general election. Some no doubt will. But some will also likely be elected. Al Salvi is running an outstanding campaign against Congressman Dick Durbin in Illinois. He is behind, but he showed in his primary that he knows how to come from behind to win. Sam Brownback in Kansas is an excellent campaigner. He is slightly ahead in his contest with Jill Docking. In Alabama, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is slightly ahead. Congressman Tim Hutchinson has a shot at winning the Senate seat in Arkansas despite Bill Clinton's being at the top of the ticket. In Colorado, Congressman Wayne Allard is even in the polls with lawyer/lobbyist Tom Strickland. And so it goes. I don't have time to mention all of the races at this point. 
<P>
But the point is this. Unless the Republicans are completely destroyed by a Democratic surge at the end of the election, similar to what happened with the Republicans in 1994, the Senate should be an improved body after November.
<P>
That is good news for those of us who have been so frustrated by the Senate's resistance to constructive measures passed by the House.
<P>
Oh, and by the way. If it is clear that Bill Clinton is going to be re-elected, the Wall Street Journal poll reports that by a margin of 53% to 39%, voters want a Republican Congress to keep Clinton in check, rather than a Democratic Congress which can enact more of Bill Clinton's agenda.
<P>
The fact is there is some hope after all in this otherwise dismal political season.

<h2>VMI Decision Tragic for the Nation</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
A tragedy occurred in the State of Virginia over the weekend for which the whole nation will pay. By a one-vote margin, the Board of Visitors of the Virginia Military Institute voted to end its 157 years as an all-male academy. Beginning with the 1997 school term, VMI will admit women.
<P>
By the same 9 - 8 vote, the Board also rejected a plan to take the school private - a move by which the Board could have avoided a court order requiring the admittance of women.
<P>
The action against VMI began in the Bush Administration. The State of Virginia fought against it. But earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that state-supported all-male schools are unconstitutional. Never mind that the State of Virginia has opened a military academy just for women so that women who desired a military education could have an equal chance to do so under the law. No, that wasn't good enough for the fanatical Supreme Court, the majority of whose Justices deserve to be impeached for undermining the Constitution.
<P>
Nevertheless, the Virginia Board of Visitors could have maintained VMI's all-male status by voting to take VMI private, thereby placing the school out of the reach of the court ruling. But, the Board voted not to. What was tragic about that narrow decision is that it was dictated not by what is right for the country whose military VMI serves, not by what was best for the students attending VMI, not by the wishes of the alumni who were prepared to raise the money to buy the school, but by the liberal media and its accomplices in the political community.
<P>
Virginia's Republican Governor, George Allen, who had originally supported VMI in its court case, changed his position, a few days before the Board of Visitors meeting. Allen got a case of political correctness and declared VMI should not go private because the media would make it into a pariah institution. That statement was enough to tip the balance in favor of admitting women. Several of Governor Allen's appointees to the Board of Visitors voted to reject the motion to take the school private.
<P>
Thanks, Governor Allen, the supposed conservative Republican with national ambitions. We'll remember this whenever you seek whatever office it is you want after leaving the Governorship next year.
<P>
I well recall the words of Dr. Ben Alexander, the former President of The University of the District of Columbia. He courageously tried to get rid of the politician imposed students who were not there to learn but just to get a worthless degree. Dr. Alexander wanted to place standards on UDC. He was doing exactly the right thing. Many of us tried to help him. But he resigned. Afterward, I asked him why he resigned when it was the right fight at the right time. He said because he was told that if he continued to fight the Washington Post would ruin him. "If I had NET back then, I might well have stayed to fight," Dr. Alexander said. But this was in the early 80's before there were many alternative means of communications.
<P>
Ben Alexander at least had an excuse. What is the excuse of the majority on the VMI Board? That their Governor considers them an embarrassment? That they would be attacked by the national media? Just when are we going to get some people in this country who will say "I don't care if we get attacked. This is the right thing to do. We are going forward." I will tell you there would be an emotional outpouring of support that would amaze and overwhelm the politicians. 
<P>
But no, the majority on the VMI Board had to listen to the state's chief politician who just didn't want the fight, lest it damage his plans for national office. Well, Governor Allen has likely brought VMI to the end of the line as a viable institution. "Without a distinctive, attractive educational niche, VMI, a small school with limited offerings in close proximity to three major state universities, will lose its ability to compete for students," Anita Blair, a VMI trustee who voted in favor of taking the school private, said after the vote. "A coed VMI soon will become indistinguishable from the existing cadet programs at Virginia Tech and elsewhere." She is absolutely right. And who will suffer in the process? The U.S. military which has used VMI to train officers now for over a Century and a half.
<P>
Isn't it time that the American public and the politicians asked themselves why it is that the media should be able to dictate what private citizens want to do? The pseudo macho majority on the VMI Board said they aren't going to change a thing at VMI when it admits women. Right. They claim that the tradition of treating freshmen cadets as rats, with shaved heads, will continue. It will never happen. But even if it did I would be against it. Women, even if they desire this kind of punishment, should not be treated this way and as the Citadel has proven, at the end of the day, they won't be.
<P>
It is all part of the effort to pretend that men and women are all the same. It is the same sort of pretend world that the Soviets invented with their concept of the "new man." It defies reality. But this sort of fiction is permitted to continue because politicians such as Governor Allen refuse to stand up and fight for what is right.
<P>
It is no wonder that Robert Bork was motivated to write his new book "Slouching Toward Gomorra." The culture is collapsing, not just because forces of evil such as elements of the media are pushing it in that direction, but because in public life there are no real men left who are willing to stand up and say "enough is enough."
<P>

<h2>A Gap Bigger Than Gender</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
Kellyanne Fitzpatrick of the Polling Company provided us with data on a survey taken from September 5th through the 12th on who will control the Congress. Her conclusion is that whatever happens in the Presidential race, Congress is going to remain in Republican hands. That conclusion is verified by several other recent polls which show the Republicans even or with a slight edge. The Polling Company finds Democrats with a one point edge, but traditionally Republicans perform better than the so-called generic ballot-test for Congress.<P>
We hear a great deal about the gender gap and indeed Kellyanne does find such a gap. But her research finds the gender gap at 8 points and not the 20 plus points which the so called mainstream media keeps touting. Kellyanne is the one, genuinely culturally-conservative pollster in the business and I trust her results. Meanwhile, Republicans hold a three-point advantage with Generation X voters (from 18 to 29 years of age) and a two-point advantage with Baby Boomers. But Republicans are down two points with so called pre-retirees (thats my age group) and down five points among seniors. Thats not surprising considering the amount of propaganda put forth by the unions and liberals on Medicare and Social Security.<P>
Now come the kickers. Here are the real gaps in American politics. Singles favor the Democrats for Congress by six percentage points. Those who are married but without children favor the Democrats by eight percentage points. But those married with children favor the Republicans by a whopping 10 percentage points!<P>
I mentioned this to Kellyanne at a dinner last night and she said, "Yes, Its the three Ms." Three Ms? What are the three Ms? "Marriage, Mortgage and Munchkins," she replied. If you want your children to vote for conservatives for Congress, not only do they need to be married, they also need to have children, Miss Fitzpatrick said. So the gap between those who are married and have children and those who are married without children is greater than the gap between men and women. Apparently, there is nothing like a few responsibilities to make voters understand who favors policies in their best interests.<P>
But lets talk about the truly gigantic gap in American politics. Yes, there is a gap bigger than either gender or marriage. Among those who dont listen to talk radio at all, the Democrats hold a nine-point advantage in the race for Congress. Among those who listen to talk radio five hours or more a week, the Republicans hold an incredible 16-point margin. Among those who listen to talk radio only one to four hours a week, the margin for the Republicans is just three points.<P>
So now things are clearing up nicely. If we care what kind of Congress we have, we must see to it that the young people we know get married and have children quickly. We must introduce talk radio to these young families immediately. I dont have the figures for those who are married, have children and listen to talk radio, but the gap must be gargantuan.<P>
Mrs. Weyrich and I are about to become grandparents for the first time. My wife has all sorts of plans to get a cradle for the baby and car seats for each of the cars, and heaven knows what else. Well all of that is fine. But as for me, Im buying this new little family several radios, each tuned to the best talk shows in the business. Hey, I care about my future!<P>

<h2>Dwelling in the Past</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>

<P>


<P>
Yesterday I attended part of a two day conference called " A Dialogue on race" at Towson State University in Baltimore. The conference was sponsored by a group called "Search for Common Ground" which promotes dialogues between opposing groups worldwide. They are active in Northern Ireland and Bosnia and have set up a dialogue between pro life and pro choice groups here in the United States.<p>

I stayed for only part of the conference because once my friend Lawry Chickering, the President of the Institute for Contemporary Studies in California, for whom I have great respect, persuaded me to go, we had a next to impossible time finding out the schedule of the event and meanwhile I got committed to other things. <p>

But I was present for the entire session which dealt with the barriers to racial progress. The group consisted of about half whites and half blacks. There were no Hispanics and only one Asian American present. Four of us were conservative philosophically. The rest ranged from left to far left. <p>

What struck me about the whole exercise was the fixation most of the blacks and many of the whites had on the past. The outstanding editor of the Heritage Foundation's magazine Policy Review, Adam Meyerson, tried to introduce the notion that many blacks represent the American dream. They have overcome slavery and segregation and have gone on to become prosperous and successful and have made important contributions to the society in which we live. Meyerson suggested that it would be well to study those examples as role models since they had, in fact, achieved the progress the others were seeking. <p>

That did not go over very well in this room filled with professionals, many of whom make their living working on the issue of racial conflict. After all, if we solved racial problems, some of these folks would be out of work. 
We were told that unless we could identify with and experience the pain suffered by blacks because of slavery, segregation and racism, we could never  make any progress. <p>

I began to think about that. The Treaty of Versailles, which imposed impossible demands on Germany after World War One, caused my family terrible trouble. They had never been wealthy. But what little they had was wiped out. They became poverty stricken and unable to support themselves financially. For such a reason did my father become the first in his family, at age l9, to journey to America in l923 to seek a decent living.<p>

All my life I have heard stories about that era and the pain it caused. I can acknowledge, and have done so, that the Versailles Treaty was unwise and unjust. But should I go around and insist that everyone else comprehend the damage done to my family because of that injustice? Granted, those conditions lasted a much shorter time than did slavery and segregation. But the principle is the same. <p>

I want to know about that era because I want to understand why my family on my father's side came here. I want to understand what happened in case world leaders ever again try to humiliate a nation the way France insisted on humiliating Germany back then. We know the consequences of that action. The Versailles Treaty created the conditions which made Adolph Hitler possible. <p>

But I did not remain dead in the water because of that injustice. Nor do I insist on discussing it constantly. 
Now I was told at that conference that, of course, my family could make progress because we were white. Oh, really? Does anyone remember what it was like being a German in-between the two World Wars? You were suspect. You were discriminated against. Laws were passed to prevent German language newspapers from being printed. A law in Wisconsin even stopped the sermons in German at the local parish church and the church bulletin had to be printed half in English and half in German. It was not a fun era. It was overcome by perseverance, discipline and hard work. <p>

Even though my family came from Germany and Norway, long after slavery had been instituted here, I am perfectly willing to acknowledge that this did great injustice to black people. I am perfectly willing to stipulate that segregation laws were unjust and that blacks got the short end of the stick for many years. <p>

But I am not willing to try to go through some exercise where I am expected to identify with the pain black people suffered back then any more than I should expect them to understand the pain my family suffered because of the unjust Versailles Treaty. These things happened. One participant did acknowledge that it was liberating for him to have learned that in history blacks sometimes oppressed other blacks and that whites sometimes enslaved other whites because he had been brought up with the notion that only whites had enslaved blacks.  True enough. Some of the blacks who came to the United States were sold to their white slave owners by other blacks. <p>

History is good to know and to understand, but it is not healthy or, productive to try to constantly relive that history. That is what prevents progress in Northern Ireland and Bosnia and elsewhere. Yes, we must acknowledge and ask God's forgiveness for injustices. But the main thing is that we work to be sure there is a level playing field because, as Meyerson has pointed out, many who have used that level playing field have made great progress.<p>
 
As for me, I don't need a conference to tell me what needs to be done. All I have to do is to take my Christian faith seriously. Many blacks are very religious people. I have more in common with them than I have with secular non believing whites. We can all move forward because of shared beliefs. Christianity is nothing if it is not a religion of forgiveness. In that context, and with the acknowledgment of past injustices, we have the framework for real progress. <p>

No, we should never forget the past. Nor should we try to relive the past. God put us here and now in this time and in this age. For that we should be grateful. We might start by thanking God for the privilege of living here. Having visited more than 50 nations in the world, I can affirm that it is a privilege even for the poorest of the poor.  Perhaps then, with a sense of gratitude, we can move to overcome artificial barriers to progress, some of which are constructed by the very people whose job is supposed to be to tear them down.

September 9, 1996
</h3>
<h2>Absent Shame, Morris Profits</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>




<P>In the latest chapter involving former Presidential advisor Dick Morris, it now seems that he is about to become a TV talk show host and will be paid a huge talent fee for doing so.
This comes after his $2 million deal with a publisher in which Morris has agreed to write a book about his exciting year and a half with Bill Clinton.<P>
The more sordid the details which emerge about this whole affair, the greater the profit for Dick Morris. And that says all you need to know about the wretched state of things in contemporary America.
When the story first broke about Morris during the Democratic convention and he was forced to resign, who was it that called him from their campaign bus to offer sympathy? Why President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. As one observer noted, it was as if Morris had been injured in a car accident. Not since that day has Bill Clinton or the prematurely canonized Al Gore ever said a single word to the effect that they disapprove of what Dick Morris did. We know Clinton and Gore think it is terrible that the prostitute was disloyal. We know they think it is terrible that the rest of the media published her tabloid account. What the American people have not heard from the President and Vice President are words to the effect that "we are sickened by what has been done here and we think Dick Morris should be ashamed of himself."<P>
No, indeed. In the past, political figures who had done far less were sent into exile for years. But Morris didn't have to endure even a day of shame for what happened. Not even from his wife. I am all for forgiveness and I don't like to see any marriage break up for any reason. My initial reaction when I heard the Morris story was to extend sympathy to Mrs. Morris whom I regarded as the real victim. But I should not have bothered. She didn't need my sympathy. She was too busy posing for the front cover of Time Magazine. By that gesture not only did she tell her husband that such behavior was acceptable, but by implication she was critical of any other wife who would have suffered extreme humiliation over what happened. She said she didn't want the details because she is an adult. How positively noble. She even quoted scripture saying that "let he who is without sin cast the first stone". It is comforting to know, I suppose, that anything from the scriptures has penetrated the consciousness of those two. <P>
Far from suffering, Dick Morris is actually better off financially from what happened than if he had simply stayed in the background and had continued to advise Clinton all the way to the election. No doubt, if Clinton is re-elected, there will be a line of future candidates at Morris' door just waiting to sign him up for all his brilliance. In fact, now even if Clinton loses, Dick Morris won't suffer. He can claim it is because he was forced to resign.<P>
It isn't just that all of this has happened that is so bad. It is the deafening silence about it from the rest of the political community. Granted Bob Dole is not in a position to say much about this, but what of the rest of his party? In their bid to show extreme tolerance, the Republicans have contributed to this dreadful situation by failing to proclaim that what Morris did is just plain wrong. The most we heard from the Republican camp was a bit of chortling because the incident caused Bill Clinton problems. That even stopped abruptly when the media pointed out that Morris had worked for Trent Lott and Jesse Helms among others. <P>
In the Old Testament God sent a plague of snakes to bite the Israelites just because they complained that they were sick of  eating the Manna from Heaven which the Lord had provided. God punished their audacity.<P>
What will it take to punish ours?<P> 
It is true that all through the history of humanity, from the Garden of Eden on, God's laws have been broken by mankind . But I guess one would have to go back to Sodom and Gomorra to find a time when people flaunted their immorality as much as they do today. Of course, God destroyed those cities.
Must we tempt God to do the same here by completely destroying the sense of shame in this nation?<P>

<h2>Conventions Losing Their Convention</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>

<P>

<P>A few parting thoughts about the Republican convention in San Diego.<P>
First, we will never know if my VP prediction would have come true. I had Bob Dole picking Gov. George Voinovich of Ohio as his running mate, but Voinovich took himself out of the running before the convention ever started. He told me privately that "no one with a last name like mine would ever get selected as a nominee of this party," a reference to his Eastern European roots. Be that as it may, Voinovich was a Catholic from a large Midwestern industrial state and might have helped Dole there. But I admit that Dole got a great deal more from his actual choice. Jack Kemp has fused the Dole campaign and Dole himself with energy and that is something that Voinovich would not have done as well. Moreover, Kemp is able to communicate with lots of voters Dole had virtually no chance of getting. To the extent that Vice Presidential picks ever help their Presidential nominees, this one certainly did and Dole has to be given an A for imagination and surprise on his choice.<P>
The convention itself was another matter. Having participated in one way or another in eight other Republican conventions since 1960, this was not, by any stretch of the imagination, a real convention. It was a four-day glorified infomercial. To be fair, the Democrats started that trend with the convention they produced in 1992 which bore little relationship to the delegates in attendance but was calculated to recast Bill Clinton as a New Democrat. They succeeded and Republicans got the picture.<P>
The delegates themselves had nothing to say about this convention. Every word, every image, even the demonstrations were scripted. To be sure there was a certain amount of scripting which occurred at every convention in the modern era. But the control of this convention was breathtaking. Members of the Politburo would have been proud. Next week we will have the Democratic version of the same scripted orchestration.<P>
The institution of the political convention cannot endure this level of contrivance for very long. Delegates who go to the trouble of getting themselves elected, based on representing grassroots networks of followers, are simply not going to tolerate paying all of that money to become a delegate only to be told they count for nothing and can't even cast the vote for which they were elected in the first place.
No, what we witnessed in San Diego and what we will witness in Chicago is not a political convention. I've been to enough of them to know the difference. What we witnessed was a grand scale TV production, in the case of San Diego, run by Mike Deaver, the Ronald Reagan image maker who later went to federal prison for improper lobbying. The irony is that most people did not watch this television spectacular. The Democrats are now worried that even fewer people will watch theirs. Except for the question of how Hillary's speech will match Elizabeth Dole's, there is really nothing interesting likely to take place there. So for all of their efforts to put on a good TV show, and it was that, the convention handlers did not achieve what a real convention, with some drama, conflict and good old fashioned political battles would have done. It did not produce an audience.<P>
With major media outlets already saying enough is enough, the era of this sort of political convention is about over. For my money good riddance. If the price of a party getting its message out is to deprive the delegates of their freedom to act as delegates, then this kind of convention is not worth having. Haley Barbour, Republican National Chairman, is busy congratulating himself on a flawless convention. I hope he has fond memories. It will probably be the last of its kind.<P>
Thanks to the many of you who called us, wrote us, E-mailed us or faxed us on our convention coverage. Our crew in San Diego, led by Peter Estrada and Greg Jenkins, worked incredibly hard. They drove themselves to the point of exhaustion. While others were out partying, the NET crew was still working. We had to. We did with less than 20 people what the major networks did with 500. We appreciate many of you saying that our coverage was better than theirs.<P>
As to Bill Lind's commentaries which some of you disliked, I asked Bill to write about this convention the way that the late H.L. Menken wrote about politics in the earlier part of this Century from his headquarters at the Baltimore Sun. Lind did just that, and he made some people angry in the process. Well stay tuned. He is going to write about the Democratic convention as well.<P>

<h2>Republicans Can Count on Whitewater</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>

<P>
Some Republicans have been smug all along  since the l994 elections, believing that they were destined to win the Presidency and keep the Congress. Even as even their own polls show Bill Clinton way out front, the smugness in these same Republican circles had continued. The reason? The belief that that somehow Whitewater or some related Clinton scandal was going to bail them out. <p>

Well, look again, Republicans. A jury in Arkansas has acquitted two Arkansas bankers on four charges of fraud in connection with the l990 Clinton gubernatorial campaign and it has deadlocked on seven others.<p>

 That trial had the most promise of directly linking Bill Clinton to wrong doing. It failed. Moreover, Whitewater Special Counsel Ken Starr has indicated that he does not believe that his investigation should interfere in the political process. What that means is if Starr did have plans to indict Hillary Clinton, and there are solid reasons to believe he did, such an indictment will wait until after the l996 elections. Starr well remembers Lawrence Walch's political inspired indictment of former defense Secretary Cap Weinberger on the eve of the l992 election and he was bitterly critical of it. He does not intend to follow that model.  <p>

So now here are the Republicans. 90 days away from the general elections and their silver bullet theory has gone out the window. Moreover Bill Clinton has done an excellent job of running to the center politically. It is hard for the electorate to distinguish Clinton's positions from Bob Dole's positions.<p>
 
What that means is that if they have any chance to win, the Republicans are going to have to come up with some real barn burner issues. These must be issues that excite the electorate. These must be issues which indicate that there is a clear cut difference between the candidates. These have to be issues which would force Bill Clinton to abandon his own base and risk losing the Presidency if he chose to echo the Republican position as he has thus far done with most of the issues Dole has weakly raised .<p>

That is a tall order for any Presidential candidate. It is an especially tall order for candidate Dole, who has made a point of running as fast to the center from the right as Clinton has run to the center from the left. It is little wonder that a poll issued late last week indicated that there is almost no interest in this year's Presidential contest, with only 20% of the electorate feeling strongly about re-electing Bill Clinton and a mere 11% of the electorate feeling strongly about electing Dole President.<p>

Miracles do happen. The Olympics demonstrated that very well. But usually they happen to people who have been working hard to prepare to take advantage of the moment. Unfortunately for Dole and the Republicans, that doesn't seem to fit the description of their candidate. With Whitewater all but gone from the political scene, Dole and the Republicans will need a sharply defined message to take to the electorate and that is something which is strangely missing from this year's political process. 

<P>

<h2>Congressman Gunderson's Allegations</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>
A point of personal privilege. Congressman Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin yesterday held a press conference which attacked me personally. Here is the background. Last year Gunderson, who has served in office in the 3rd Congressional District from Wisconsin since l980, announced that he would not seek another term in Congress. <p>

Subsequent to that time, Congressman Pat Roberts, who has been Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, decided to run for the U.S. Senate for the seat now held by Nancy Kassebaum. The man in line to succeed Roberts as Chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Bill Emerson, died. Thus Gunderson, who was next in line, began to change his mind. He asked the Republican candidate for Congress Jim Harsdorf to step aside. He declined to do so. Notwithstanding that Gunderson, one of the openly homosexual Members of Congress, encouraged a write in candidacy on his own behalf. Yesterday he announced that he was pulling the plug on that effort and that he would not be a candidate for re-election after all.<p>

In the process of making that announcement, Gunderson said the following: "It has come to my attention that conservative social groups in this country, led by Paul Weyrich, have informed the Speaker they would initiate a major independent expenditure against me. I have been informed that these people were prepared to do whatever was necessary to not only defeat me, but destroy me. I have been informed these groups were going to make allegations regarding my health status and AIDS. I have been informed that they were going to engage in other elements of character assassination....... Ladies and gentlemen, the reality is that to some people in this country, the possibility of someone who is openly gay assuming the chair of a major Committee in Congress somehow legitimizes their personal life. And sadly, they could not accept that. "<p>
 
Gunderson said he had been assured by Speaker Gingrich that he would support Gunderson all the way if he chose to do the write in. This is the same Speaker Gingrich who is punishing Congressmen Smith and Dornan for standing on principle. <p>

Now let me make this clear. I wish I could take credit for driving Steve Gunderson out of the race. His lifestyle is his own business, and I have not sought to make it an issue. He did. He openly flaunted his lover at Congressional functions. His partner, whose name is Rob, even enjoyed a spousal pass in Congress which meant he had a special parking place and get into otherwise restricted areas. <P>

But I opposed Gunderson because of what he believed in. He was one of these so called "moderates" who was nearly always working at cross purposes with those of us who believe in traditional values.<p>
 
The fact is , however, that Gunderson made up this charge about an independent expenditure against him. I have made no such move. I have never discussed such an idea with anyone. Anyone who knows me knows that I deal with issues. Lifestyles only become important when the high nature of the office demands it (for example, a President who was on drugs could not perform his duties appropriately) or when the person himself makes it an issue by his or her conduct. <p>

Speaker Gingrich would not possibly have known about such an independent expenditure because I have not spoken to the Speaker or his staff or any other Member of the leadership or their staffs or anyone else for that matter about such a campaign. <p>

The fact is, and he admits it in his own statement, that leading Republicans in his own state were adamantly opposed to his running. I had nothing whatsoever to do with that. I never spoke with any of them. Gunderson, despite the poll he released which claims that the people were clamoring for him to run, was afraid he would lose. In Washington, the game these days is to blame someone else for your decisions. I guess for Gunderson, I was a convenient target.<p>

As difficult as it is for anyone who is considered a public figure to win a libel or slander suit these days, I have my attorneys looking into the matter. As happy as I am to see him leave the Congress, Steve Gunderson should not be permitted to make things up about me or anyone else. He should not be permitted to sully my good name.<p>
 
Gunderson said that "ugliness has become the rule, rather than the exception in modern day campaigns." If that is true, then what Gunderson did is one of the worst examples of ugliness I have ever seen in the electoral process. He is truly a pathetic public figure. All of us should pray for him.<P>

<h2>Clinton and Terrorism</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>
It is an all too familiar sound. President Clinton, in a broadcast to the nation, offers
                      sympathy to the families of the victims of terrorism. Then he insists that no stone
                      will be left unturned to track down and punish those responsible. 
<P>
                      Those words, used over and over again recently after the blast in Saudi Arabia,
                      after TWA's Flight 800 and after the Olympic pipe bomb incident, just to name a
                      few in the past weeks, may comfort the nation. But the deeds of the Clinton
                      Administration are another matter. 
<P>
                      One of the nation's leading experts on terrorism told me privately the other day that
                      this Administration has resisted doing what is absolutely necessary if we are
                      actually serious about tracking down those responsible, and if we truly want to
                      prevent future incidents of terrorism. The Administration doesn't want to use human
                      agents to infiltrate suspected terrorist groups. 
<P>
                      "The problem with the Clinton Administration", this expert in terrorism told me, "is
                      that they think you can track down everything by satellite and other electronic
                      means. But in combating terrorism, there is no substitute for having real live bodies
                      on the scene. That's how you really get the job done". 
<P>
                      It is ironic too because after Oklahoma City, when it was clear that the suspects
                      were domestic anarchists, the Administration was only too willing to engage in
                      spying. The Republican Congress finally stripped most of those powers from the
                      legislation which Bill Clinton submitted to Congress. 
<P>
                      But when it comes to the international variety, the Administration, trapped by its
                      own l960's view of the world, rejects escalated spying. 
<P>
                      That is, in fact, typical of the attitude of the far left, which formed its attitudes about
                      spying in the depth of the cold war. Somehow, for the far left, it was acceptable for
                      the Soviets to have their agents everywhere in the United States. But it was
                      impermissible for the United States to spy on Soviet activities. The left has never
                      been shy about double standards. 
<P>
                      President Clinton is one of the most able Presidents we have ever employed when
                      it comes to sympathizing with the victims of terrorism. The relatives of those killed
                      in TWA Flight 800 sang the praises of Clinton as he spent several hours with them
                      last week. His efforts in that regard are commendable.
<P>
                      But the one effective thing Clinton could do for those relatives-- to track down
                      those who were responsible for the tragedy itself by the most effective means
                      possible, the President is reluctant to do.

<h3>July 26, 1996
</h3>
<h2>Sacrificing Conscience to Republican Totalitarianism</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p><p>

In two nations which were part of the NATO alliance, conservative political parties which were at one time dominant forces in those countries, have all but disappeared. In Canada, the Progressive Conservatives went from a solid outright majority in the Parliament to just two seats following the last Canadian election. In Italy, the Christian Democrats, long the party of the Roman Catholic Church, and nearly always the central partner in Italy's many post-war governments, has nearly vanished following recent elections there.
<p.
In the United States, the Republican party may be next. This week the party took another giant step in that direction. House Speaker Newt Gingrich inflicted ex post facto discipline on Reps. Bob Dornan (R-CA) and Chris Smith (R-NJ) for supporting former Congressman Joe DioGuardi in his primary race against the militantly pro-abortionist Rep. Sue Kelly (R-NJ). Dornan and Smith were forbidden to serve on key conference committees which are bringing forth crucial bills to be passed before this Congress becomes history. Moreover, both Congressmen have been denied travel funds even though both are chairmen of international subcommittees where travel is required as part of the responsibilities of the committee.
For Rep. Smith especially, opposing Kelly was an exercise of his conscience. Rep. Kelly is one of five Republicans to vote with Bill Clinton on the partial birth abortion issue. Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor of New York has called the brutal murder of the baby in the partial birth abortion procedure infanticide. Mr. DioGuardi is in the race because of that issue.
<p>
Rep. Smith has introduced a freedom of conscience resolution in the House Republican Conference. It declares that any Member of Congress shall have the right to back any candidate for office according to his own conscience. Moreover, if sanctions were to be imposed on a Member for doing so, the resolution would require a vote on the issue by the entire House GOP Conference.
<p>
Smith needs 50 signatures on his resolution to have it considered. He is having trouble getting the signatures because Speaker Gingrich has so intimidated Members with his disciplinary measures that many who are sympathetic to Smith are now afraid to sign up.
<p>
The fact is there was no rule in the GOP Conference against a Member supporting a primary opponent of a sitting congressman. In a display of Soviet style justice, the sanctions were imposed after the fact.
If we have come to the point where, because he serves as a Republican Member of the House, a Member of Congress can no longer follow his conscience (and anyone who knows Smith knows that he is genuinely a man of conscience), then we have changed our form of government overnight without the consent of the governed. If these sanctions are allowed to stand, the Republican party, in due course, will surely follow the way of the Canadian Conservatives and the Italian Christian Democrats.
<p>
If to be a Republican means one has to give up his freedom of conscience, then the price, as Rep. Mark Neumann (R-WI) has suggested, is much too high.

<h2>Casino Gambling Reform Hits Roadblock</h2>
<p><p><p>
<blockquote>
When both sides of a highly contentious issue claim they are satisfied with the result of a compromise, it is a sure sign that very little will be accomplished. That is exactly the case with a bill, for which the House of Representatives gave final approval, which would create a federal commission to examine the $40 billion gambling industry.
<p>
That any bill was passed at all was due to a rare combination of the religious right, who believe that gambling has hurt families, and liberals who target the gambling industry as another example of the corruption of free enterprise. 
<p>
The original bill, as conceived by Congressman Frank Wolf, an evangelical Christian from Virginia, was greatly weakened. 
<p>
Originally the commission would have had broad subpoena power. But the bill which passed the Congress, now permits the commission to only subpoena documents, not people. In addition, if material is not available from public sources, the Commission must keep its information confidential. Wolf said he is satisfied with the powers the commission has. But so is Frank Fahrenkopf, the former Republican National Chairman, who represents the gambling industry in Washington. He says he welcomes a "balanced" inquiry into the industry. 
<p>
What all of this means is that Congressman Wolf got just enough out of the commission that he doesn't have to deny that his bill was gutted, while Fahrenkopf is satisfied that the commission doesn't really have enough power to do any real damage to the industry. So there you have it. Another "Washington Commission" has been born. It will spend lots of taxpayer money. It will issue reports. Most likely few will read the reports. Nothing will change. 
<p>
Congressman Henry Hyde, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said the commission was needed to know the implications of the growth of the gambling industry. A couple of decades ago there was legalized gambling in only two states, Nevada and New Jersey. Now only two states, Utah and Hawaii, ban legalized gambling, and there are operating casinos in 23 states. 
<p>
The Family Research Council points out that in states where gambling is flourishing, more and more families are becoming impoverished. They contend that gambling is addictive in many cases and has led to financial ruin for many families who otherwise would be able to maintain themselves. The gambling industry, on the other hand, contends that only 5% of gamblers are addicted. And so the debate goes on and on. 
<p>
It is really a part of an age old debate about what sorts of activity, which if done in excess can lead to the destruction of human beings, should thus be legal and open for all citizens to participate. Such a debate preceded the passage of the Volstead Act, the Constitutional amendment which outlawed the sale of liquor and was in force for more than a decade. Enforcement of the Volstead Act, critics claim, was responsible for the establishment of the Mafia in the United States, as liquor sales went underground. The same question now pertains to gambling. Should it be open and above board where it can be seen and regulated? Or is society better off if gambling is underground, even if authorities have a much harder time policing it?
The new Gambling Commission may provide some data, but it is unlikely to resolve the issue. The real question, as it is with pornography on the Internet or drug usage and other such matters, is simply this: what damage is caused to society when potentially sinful activities are engaged in by a substantial percentage of its population? And if it can be proven that substantial damage is done by such activities to society as a whole, what right does society have to curb the choices which can be made by free citizens?
Libertarians contend that citizens should be free to do as they wish, because it is a matter of their choice to use their resources as they see fit. Traditionalists contend that society must protect itself against any behavior which is seen as self destructive and should therefore be free to curb such behavior. Thus far, the Supreme Court has tended to side with the Libertarians. 
<p>
But in any case, that will continue to be debated so long as we have the freedom to do so. It will be debated long after the new Gambling Commission issues its ponderous reports, which when all is said and done, are not likely to effect the outcome of the debate in this society much at all. That's all for Direct Line for tonight.

<h3>Wednesday, July 23, 1996
<p></h3><h2>
The Next American Revolution
<p></h2><p><p>
<blockquote>
This past Spring, President Clinton took the unprecedented step of praising his opponent, Bob Dole, for insisting that a disclaimer be added to the Republican Party platform.  The disclaimer calls for tolerance for opposing opinions.  For weeks, the issue was the Republican's so-called anti-abortion plank.  The establishment media feasted on the debate over whether to amend the language.  While Clinton cheered him on, Dole finally resolved to put the tolerance disclaimer in the preamble to the platform, although for awhile he seemed wrestle with a decision to put the tolerance language directly in the paragraph which addresses the issue of abortion.
<P>
Interestingly, no such call for tolerance is leveled against the Democratic Platform.  Look at the language of the two platforms: the Republican plank actually says little about abortion and weakly calls for a human life amendment which would have no guarantee of saving unborn lives.  The Democratic Party Plank strongly asserts the practice of abortion on demand and even calls for a national law to enforce the practice.  Again, not one word is offered to suggest Democrats should adopt changes in their pro-abortion plank, not even words of tolerance.
<p>
Ultimately the real debate this year is much larger than opposing platforms.  The real contest this year is no longer between Republicans and Democrats. It is a contest which pits Washington against its own citizens.  Let's be honest about one thing: the Republican and Democratic parties are both pretty much run by establishment politicians. Yet, what our culture badly needs is honesty in its political process.  Our society desperately needs elected leaders who maintain the courage of their convictions.
<p>
All of this may require a third political party.  If that is the case, then so be it.  You see, America has reached a great crossroads in its history.  Our nation faces a great dilemma  our government is in debt bordering on insolvency.  Meanwhile, increasingly, our country faces threats from unknown entities throughout the world in the form of terrorism.
<p>
What we need more than anything else is prayer; the prayer of honest citizens that our elected leaders act responsibly; prayer that our culture turns from its tailspin of depravity; prayer that God, who at one time blessed this great nation of ours, will again restore our nation to moral and fiscal health.
God has given us a wonderful gift. He has given us a nation in which its citizens are free to worship, speak, own property, and elect popular leaders. But slowly we have allowed our elected leaders and cultural elitists to squandered that gift, through debt, moral erosion, lawlessness and political deceit. I believe God can judge America or save America. It's up to us. But time is running out, both for our economic and spiritual well-being.
<p>
If we as a nation return to the faith and righteous principles upon which this country was founded, I believe God will once restore to our nation the America we once were. May God help us to pray for that to happen.

<h2>Business-As-Usual No Longer Works</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>

This morning's Washington Post is just gloating over Republican Senators who, the Post says, have rediscovered government. They cite among others, Senator Bob Bennett of Utah who fought to add another $10 million to the appropriations for the National Endowment for the Arts because, he says, the Endowment supports dozens of small cultural entities in Utah.<P>
The Post describes Bennett as a Mormon with strong culturally conservative views. Those views, the paper is happy to report, were not enough to override his desire to bring federal money to his state, even though the National Endowment for the Arts funds pornography and homosexual art. The last time I checked, neither was well thought of in Mormon circles.<P>
But the case of Bennett, and several other Republican Senators mentioned, serves to illustrate why the Republican attempt to balance the budget by 2002 absent a Constitutional Amendment is folly. There are always just enough so-called conservative Senators who are willing to play the game of trying to be the local hero who brought home the federal bacon. Therefore cutting federal spending becomes next to impossible.<P>
We had cultural activities in my hometown, but local people supported them with their own money. If they didn't, the local symphony and museums and other projects would have disappeared. And this is as it should be.<P>
If the question is should cultural projects in Utah be funded by the rest of us taxpayers, sure voters will say yes. But if the question is should we as a nation go into debt to fund these projects, my betting is the answer would be different. Bennett, I am willing to wager, could maintain his political support by posing the second question rather than the first.<P>
This Congress came within a single vote of passing a Constitutional Amendment to balance the budget. With Bill Clinton continuing to lead Bob Dole and Ross Perot by such impressive numbers, I fear that the next Congress will be even less willing to pass such an amendment. Yet the fiscal condition of the nation demands that this be done. We are on the verge of bankruptcy.<P>
I have to give credit to Perot and Dick Lamm, the rivals in the Reform party. At least they are talking about this issue. You don't hear either Bill Clinton or Bob Dole saying much about it, and they would say nothing at all if the Reform party weren't in the mix.<P>
If the next Congress is unable to muster the two-thirds vote necessary to pass a Constitutional Amendment, then there is no alternative to a Constitutional Convention to take up that issue, term limits and other such questions which are beyond the courage of the Congress. Then at least the states would be given the chance to ratify or reject such proposals. My guess is that at the state level, a balanced budget would get overwhelming approval.<P>
The politicians like Bennett just don't get it yet. The way we've done business for the past sixty years just doesn't work anymore. The nation can't afford it. But since there seems to be no hope of replacing enough ordinary politicians in the Congress, our only hope is an extraordinary measure such as a Constitutional Convention. I regret that is the case and there are dangers in calling such a convention. But the alternative is to have business as usual and this business is going belly up.<P><P>

<h2>Bob Dole and His Convention</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>
<P>It is a strange world, this world of politics. Reality seldom penetrates the consciousness of the players. Perceptions, which are often created by one's political enemies, become reality. And politicians act upon that false reality. <P>Such is the case concerning the 1992 Republican national convention in Houston.<P>On the first day of the convention, the man who challenged President Bush, Pat Buchanan, gave a barn burner of a speech. The late John Chancellor of NBC called it one of the finest speeches he had ever heard at a convention and that was saying something since Chancellor had covered politics since the 1950's. Also speaking that evening were former Education Secretary and Drug Czar Bill Bennett and former President Ronald Reagan. Both gave excellent speeches. Polls were taken that night and for the one and only time during the peak political season, George Bush led Bill Clinton in the Presidential race.<P>But other media began to criticize both the Bennett and Buchanan speeches, especially the part of Buchanan's speech where he suggested we were in the midst of a culture war. Excerpts of that speech were played over and over again, out of context, and Buchanan was ripped apart by the media and by liberal politicians. When George Bush lost to Bill Clinton, this same media blamed his loss on Buchanan and conservatives who allegedly scared moderate women away from the Republicans. <P>Now mind you, those speeches, including Buchanan's, only helped Bush in all actuality. In truth, George Bush was fired by the American people for two reasons. First because he pledged not to raise taxes and then engineered the largest tax increase in history up to that point. Second because Bush seemed to be preoccupied with foreign affairs at a time when the United States was in a mild recession. <P>One person, however, bought the media line about 1992 wholesale. That person is Bob Dole. Determined not to scare these same fictitious voters, Dole has banned Pat Buchanan from speaking in a major time slot at the convention, even though Buchanan ended up the runner up in the Presidential contest. Such a move is without precedent in modern American politics. Moreover, Dole has put forward the feminist Republican Susan Molinari as the keynote speaker. Colin Powell, a self declared Rockefeller Republican who disagrees with most of the GOP platform, will also be featured that first night. The Dole advisers are confident that when he puts forth this moderate image to the American people they will come flocking to him in droves. <P>It is an interesting theory. By that measure, Dole can be elected President by doing what the media wants. Never mind that in reality Dole will be driving away millions of conservative voters in the process. That is the truth. Oh, yes, and there is one other little problem. The media loves Bill Clinton much more than Bob Dole no matter what Dole does to try to please them. When all is said and done they won't give him much credit for doing what they have proscribed for the Republican party. Perceptions will vanish and reality will hit home to Bob Dole on election night. For Dateline Washington, I'm Paul Weyrich.

<h2>Racism, Sexism Revisited</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>
<P>
Bill Lind's recent series of commentaries on Political Correctness created quite a stir here at NET.  We have had a substantial internal debate about whether, particularly, his commentary of Monday, July 9 promotes or invites racism.  We've also had some discussion about his July 10 commentary on sexism.
When authentic, racism is extremely harmful because it fails to consider the worth and dignity of each person as an individual.  As Mr. Lind noted in one of his commentaries, "Wise people judge other individuals as individuals, not as members of any group."<P>
Our culture has indeed become so Politically Correct, so infected by false racism and irrational sexism, that it has become quite difficult to discuss any of these issues without being accused of committing that which one would condemn.  People today are so often told that they are victims of characteristics beyond their control that they tend to believe it.  Worse, those who have experienced real discrimination, yet whose lives are dedicated to rising above it by courageously finding ways up, over and around it, are the most seriously harmed by false discrimination.  Why?  Because false discrimination tends to become confused with authentic discrimination.  Real discrimination thus becomes harder to detect, which means that fewer citizens take action to stamp it out.<P>
The late Dr. Martin Luther King urged Americans to judge people by the content of their character.  We at NET, and at its founding organization, the Free Congress Foundation, agree with that statement.  We do not espouse or condone racism in any form.  We are committed to the fair treatment of everyone.  Consequently we condemn both real and false racism.<P>
As Mr. Lind also noted in last week's series, we recognize that men and women are different.  Complementary, but different.  Thus we believe, for example, that single-sex education, recently condemned by the Supreme Court, should be supported in this country; we endorse parental choice in education.  That does not deny that many young men and women do well in a co-educational environment; nor does it deny that most men and women are able to perform the vast majority of  jobs equally well.  However, we disagree with the feminist view that there are no differences between men and women.  That view is a delusion. It is a failure to recognize physical reality.  We are not all the same; each of us is a unique individual, deserving of respect as such.<P>
In our NET commentaries, we intend to discuss difficult, contentious issues.  Our editorial viewpoint is, for example, uncompromisingly pro-life and pro-family.  We will continue to express ourselves, and to present guest commentaries on controversial issues, because we believe you, our viewers, are well-served by discussions of issues rarely presented elsewhere with forthrightness based on a search for truth.  And when our commentaries create controversy internally, we will continue to have open, frank discussions.  Your views are important to us as well; they enrich our discussions, and they help us to know you better.  So we invite you to call, write, fax and e-email us whenever you wish to comment on an issue, or on anything else we do.<P>

<h2>Lamm Candidacy Adds Dimension</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>
I was out of the country when former Colorado Governor Dick Lamm announced that he was going to run for President. Fortunately, I returned last night from Bulgaria just in time to see the repeat of that press conference on C SPAN.<P>
Lamm has burned his bridges and has now agreed to support the nominee of the Reform party, even if that nominee is Ross Perot, against whom Lamm is now running for the Presidential nomination.<P>
On the surface Lamm's candidacy looks like a quixotic one. He is barely known outside of Colorado. He is running in the party which Perot founded with Perot's money. It is unclear who will vote in that party primary, which is being conducted by mail over a several day period.<P>
Lamm has only about a month to get himself well enough known that he would have a shot at defeating Perot in the Reform party primary. Given his lack of financial resources, Lamm would seem to be a sure loser to Perot. But Lamm is touching a chord with his message. In fact, his candidacy was the result of his stark assessment of where we as a nation have gone wrong. He delivered that assessment to a state convention in California. Delegates, right then and there, circulated a petition and urged Lamm to run. Other states followed. This prompted Perot, who had planned on a coronation for the Reform party nomination, to announce prematurely that he was likely to run again and so the campaign has begun.
Mind you I completely disagree with Governor Lamm's social issues policies. We are about as far apart as two people can get on that spectrum. But I have long admired Dick Lamm as a man who believes in what he says and has the courage of his convictions.<P>
I am also a big fan of former Colorado Senator Bill Armstrong, who in my view, missed his calling by not being a Presidential candidate in 1996. I think he would have swept all the others away. Were he the nominee, Republicans would not now be facing the sort of electoral disaster that awaits them if Bill Clinton continues to hold on to the sort of numbers he has now.<P>
The year was 1984 and Armstrong was seeking his second term in the U.S. Senate. Dick Lamm was then Governor of Colorado and widely thought to be a possible candidate for the Senate. Armstrong proposed that if Lamm were the Democratic candidate for the Senate, the two of them should go city by city throughout Colorado together, debating the issues. For whatever reason Lamm did not run that year. I suspect he wasn't sure he could defeat the equally articulate Armstrong.<P>
What a Senate campaign that would have been. Two of the most knowledgeable and attractive candidates ever to have run for public office debating real issues in the public forum. That is the way our system ought to work. <P>
Now Lamm is out there for President and the odds are very much against him. Unfortunately he has to run at a time when the American voters are least tuned into politics. It is a pity because, agree or disagree, they need to hear what Lamm has to say. He is making points that other politicians simply refuse to talk about. True, Bob Dole does pay lip service to the notion that excessive spending by government is not a good idea, even though he has helped to pass much of what he now complains about.<P>
Lamm, coming as he does from the liberal wing of the Democratic party, has the greater impact on such issues. What Dole says is expected from a Republican candidate. When Lamm says it, it has real credibility. Dick Lamm is to entitlements and the bankruptcy of America what Richard Nixon was to China. His message is tough, but he has a non-threatening personality. Lamm can say what he says without scaring people the way some republicans manage to do so. He makes you stop and think. And by the way, what he says about entitlements is the same thing that senators Al Simpson of Wyoming and Robert Kerry of Nebraska have been saying now for some time. Perhaps at the Presidential level Lamm can get the audience Simpson and Kerry have never managed to get.<P>
I wish Dick Lamm well. His policies on values questions preclude my voting for him but I think he is doing the nation a service just by running. He brings a desperately needed level of candor to the Presidential campaign in which Bill Clinton lies, Bob Dole speaks unintelligibly, and Ross Perot speaks only in platitudes.<P>
If by some wholly unexpected chance he were to defeat Perot in his own primary and go on to the general election, Lamm would totally destabilize the November election scene. Liberals would have an alternative to Bill Clinton and conservatives whose primary focus is our entitlement mess would have an alternative to Bob Dole. A debate between the three of them is a Presidential campaign to die for.<P>
Just like the exciting possibility back in Colorado in 1984, it is unlikely to happen. But given this uninspiring political campaign, our thanks to Dick Lamm for giving us something to at least dream about.<P>

<h2>Disney's Moral Whitewash</h2>
<P>

Awhile back the Southern Baptist convention passed a resolution at their annual convention of Messengers calling on their members to boycott Walt Disney theme parks, movies and merchandise.<P>
Granted the Southern Baptists cant control what their members do and many of them are not likely to go along with the boycott; still it is an uncomfortable position for Disney to be in with the largest Protestant denomination in the United States telling its membership to stay away from Disney properties.<P>
The Southern Baptists were protesting not only the Disney decision, as a corporation, to grant benefits to homosexual partnerships but also recent Disney distributed films.  For example, last year Disney released "the Priest," a movie which portrayed a homosexual clergyman sympathetically. Indeed, even what are supposed to be classic style Disney movies such as "the Lion King" and the "Hunchback of Notre Dame" are now filled with sexual references. Reviewers are even suggesting that "Hunchback" is not an appropriate movie for children. Michael Eisner and company have taken the Disney company a long way from its pro family roots. No wonder the Disney theme parks now sport a Gay and Lesbian pride day with special discounts for public displays of such behavior.<P>
So to the rescue comes Father Leo ODonovan, the President of Georgetown University, one of the most venerable Catholic institutions in the nation. He has just been elected to a two year term on the Disney board. Father ODonovan can be expected to uphold traditional Judeo Christian moral values, right? ODonovan is Eisners market response to the move by the Southern Baptists, right?<P>
Well, think again. ODonovan is to traditional Catholics what John Chaffee is to traditional Republicans. ODonovan is a liberal Catholic. He has been elected to the board not to make the Disney company sensitive to traditional morality but to give Eisner cover. Already he has defended the Disney decision to grant benefits to homosexual couples as standard industry practice and he has defended the Disney distribution of the movie "the Priest." ODonovan says that a company or an individual cant be judged by "a single act or production, or wed never lead lives or have businesses."<P>
Are you surprised? Im not. Georgetown has its own Gay pride activities with the full blessing of ODonovan. Indeed ODonovan has done his best to remove what little vestiges of the Catholic faith remained at Georgetown.<P>
Soon after he became President six years ago, ODonovan showed up here at a dinner party I had to discuss our pioneer television efforts. I say showed up because I hadnt invited him. He came as the uninvited guest of someone we did ask to come. It was clear ten minutes into our conversation that he was a liberal who will defend just about anything on the liberal agenda.<P>
Eisner was not bowing to market pressure from the Baptists and the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights which has similarly blasted Disney. Eisner was looking for someone with credentials who could defend the company and give a thumbs up for its immoral practices. Well since Notre Dames former President Theodore Hesburgh is too busy serving on Bill Clintons legal defense fund board, I guess ODonovan was the next best thing. Besides, Hesburgh is well known as a liberal. ODonovan isnt, so he will be more useful to Eisner.<P>
No, if Disney is serious about wanting some moral input, I am sure Dr. James Dobson, or the Presbyterian intellectual D. James Kennedy or one of the many former Presidents of the Southern Baptists would be available. Or if Disney really does want the genuine Catholic point of view, I suggest Cardinal OConnor of New York or Cardinal Law of Boston.<P>
What Disney needs is someone on its board who will represent the point of view of parents to the company and not the other way around. Eisner is clever.  Appointing ODonovan is a good public relations move. But the Southern Baptists and the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights are still correct. What Disney is producing these days is a disgrace. The company should be boycotted. Real economic pressure will force real change. The ODonovan appointment, far from a bow to the traditional values community, represents business as usual.<P>

<h2>Faith and Global Stability</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
The White House, the State Department, and the United Nations are happy over the result of the Russian elections this past week.  Incumbent Boris Yeltsin won.  The White House, the State Department, and the United Nations were not happy over the result of the Israeli elections last month.  The incumbent lost.<P>
This mentality speaks volumes for the modern world view of global stability.  The world leaders now put the concept of global stability above risk, higher than right and wrong, and ahead of principle.  This means that human rights, individual freedoms and even democracy now take a back seat to the new global imperative of maintaining stability, status quo, and "peace."<P>
No policy is without an overriding philosophy and global stability is no exception. Its philosophy is relativism, a mentality which holds that truth and even morality can only be defined within the context of todays events.<P>
Today, those who question the philosophy of relativism are scorned by the popular culture, in the press, on TV and in Hollywood.<P>
Ask U.S. Supreme Court justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.  Speaking at separate events, Scalia and Thomas recently told of the importance of faith in God.  Thomas was criticized for his religious views.  Academia laughed at Scalia for believing in angels.  The culture wants to stop jurists like Scalia, Thomas and William Rhenquist for applying Constitutional absolutes to legal cases for a society which has begun to question eternal truth and moral absolutes.<P>
I for one agree with Scalia. Let them laugh.  Angels are real.  We cant see God and we cant see the wind.  Yet God and the wind exist whether the cultural engineers like it or not.  In fact, its not what they think that matters but what God thinks that really matters.  Thats the faith perspective. Thats exactly whats missing from the new world view of the White House, the State Department and the United Nations.<P>
The faith perspective understands right from wrong.  The faith perspective realizes there is something much greater at stake than the futile pursuit of peace through stability.  A faith perspective requires leaders to take a moral stand, armed with absolutes which modern events simply cannot change.<P>
Murder and stealing are forbidden by our laws. Why?  Because life and charity are good things according to the precepts of God who does not change.<P>
Our society began with a belief in God and with faith.  Look at the words on our coins.  It doesnt say in the world we trust, in the UN we trust, or even in government we trust.  Our nation began with a cultural trust in God and a societal faith in Gods precepts.<P>
The faith of a nation is a powerful quality.  It has made the twentieth century the century of America, a nation founded on belief in God.<P>
Our nation will never end with a belief in God, but it can end without a belief in God, and we must never let that happen.  Its time to end the global stability and moral relativity lock on our future.  America doesnt need a UN to tell us where weve been or a faithless government to tell us where we can go.  What America needs today is a few good citizens, of faith and courage, to safely guide us into the next great century.<P>

<h2>Cigarettes and Aliens in Washington
</h2>
<P>

There's a new movie out this week, appropriately named "Independence Day."  In Washington, this movie is so hot, they are running a 4 a.m. showing at the Uptown Theater and even that is sold out.  "Independence Day" is about aliens who take over and eventually destroy the White House.  The world is next on their agenda.<P>
The trouble is, the movie is about three years too late.  The aliens have occupied the White House since George Bush left in 1993.  No plot from Hollywood could possibly come close to what we already have with these diabolical aliens.  There's the First Lady who doesn't remember making a call from Arkansas the night lawyer Vince Foster mysteriously died.  There's the Vice President who advocates a new world order run by environmentalists.  There's the president who tells one group he's pro-life and then supports the practice of partial birth abortions.  This is the White House that ordered FBI summary files on its political enemies.  These are the aliens who brought us Whitewater, travel-gate and "I feel your pain."<P>
Let's just say I'm glad I'm not running the President's reelection campaign.  His party has their hands full trying to contain a candidate who has begun to hemorrhage in the polls.<P>
Perhaps the Democratic party has found a way out.  They recently discovered what they are sure will be a scandal against Republican opponent Bob Dole.  The scandal they have begun to stoke is cigarettes.  It seems Bob Dole used to smoke cigarettes. Unlike the President, Mr. Dole admits that he actually inhaled.  The Democrats are so certain they have a marketable scandal against Dole, they've even hired an actor to follow the Dole campaign.  Each morning the actor dresses himself as a seven-foot cigarette.  The actor who portrays this giant cigarette calls himself "Butt Man."  The idea is that Mr. Dole is somehow villainous because his campaign has received money from cigarette conglomerates.  What's worse, Mr. Dole won't even say he's sorry.<P>
The Democratic National Committee says it is proud of "Butt Man."  What else can they talk about?  After all, Dole is about as scandalous as Socks the Cat-and we're told Socks even counts mice among his friends.<P>
"Butt Man" probably won't be coming to a town near you.  Certainly "Independence Day" will soon be playing at theater near you.  If you go to see it, remember to follow these simple rules of theater etiquette.  First, don't talk when the movie begins, that irritates other viewers. Second, don't laugh when you see the White House blow up, it really isn't funny. And finally, whatever you do, don't smoke. The real aliens just might attack you, in the press.<P>

<h2>The Establishment is Having a Fit</h2>
<P>

<P>
                      Establishment Republicans across the country are upset at the rising influencing of
                      anti-establishment Conservatives in their party. These party professionals have drawn
                      quiet sympathy from their Democratic counterparts who share their disdain over the
                      revolutionary voices of an anti-Washington public threatening the status quo of the
                      cozy two-party system.
<P>
                      In Kansas, the establishment has quietly criticized Sam Brownback, a conservative
                      freshman Congressman, because he is running for Bob Dole's vacated Senate seat.
                      The Republican establishment has chosen a liberal to fill the seat, and view
                      Brownback as a threat to the carefully-crafted status quo.
<P>
                      In South Carolina, eleven Christian conservatives outpaced former Governor Carroll
                      Campbell this Spring in the voting for the state's delegates to the National Convention.
                      Campbell was furious that unknowns would challenge the establishment. "I play in a
                      much bigger league than they do," Campbell later told reporters. "I don't have time to
                      fool with them."
<P>
                      All of this intolerance towards anti-establishment conservatives is masked in official
                      calls for tolerance toward liberals in the Republican party. The center of gravity in
                      today's political debate is the culture. The issue most symbolic of the cultural debate is
                      abortion. It is for this reason that the establishment insists on language of tolerance
                      only in the abortion plank.
<P>                      At the same time, no such call for tolerance is leveled against the Democratic
                      Platform. Look at the language of the two platforms: the Republican plank actually
                      says little about abortion and weakly calls for a human life amendment which would
                      have no guarantee of saving unborn lives. The Democratic Party Plank strongly asserts
                      the practice of abortion on demand and even calls for a national law to enforce the
                      practice. Again, not one word is offered to suggest Democrats should adopt changes
                      in their pro-abortion plank, not even words of tolerance.

                      While the two parties continue to apply a double meaning to the term "tolerance," a
                      vast group of Americans have begun to rethink their support for the Republican Party.
                      In fact, the day is coming when ordinary American voters will no longer be able to tell
                      the two parties apart. When that happens, it is likely that a new, anti-establishment
                      party will arise, fueled by a public outraged at being ignored by both Republicans and
                      Democrats.

                      You see the real debate this year is much larger than opposing platforms. The real
                      contest this year is no longer between Republicans and Democrats. It is a contest
                      which pits Washington against its own citizens. Let's be honest about one thing: the
                      Republican and Democratic parties are both pretty much run by professional
                      politicians. It is this same establishment that long ago took Washington into captivity,
                      controlling the media, lobbying for special interests

There is an old country song which goes, "I was country, when country wasn't cool."  Like the song, there was a time when Whitewater, as a news story, wasn't cool.  Now that Special Counsel Ken Starr has secured actual jury convictions, and now that Attorney General Janet Reno has added "Filegate" to Starr's portfolio, Starr and Whitewater enjoy generally-accepted credibility.<P>
Today Whitewater is cool.  But I remember the days when Whitewater wasn't cool.  I recall 1994, when Washington Times investigative reporter Jerry Seper uncovered factual Whitewater information on an almost daily basis. On Whitewater, Seper spent weeks meticulously fitting together the factual pieces of a puzzle scattered over a ten year period, strewn across Arkansas and Washington, DC, and overlooked by establishment reporters who sat on the facts because Whitewater wasn't cool.<P>
At the same time, NET-television network began a weekly "Whitewater Update" on "Capitol Watch."  NET tried to get the painfully uncompromising Mr. Seper on our program, but found him routinely unavailable for the limelight. Fortunately, we managed convince several of his colleagues to help us present to our live call-in audience the factual details known at the time.  Editorial Page Editor Tod Lindberg, editorial writer Eric Felton, and even Wesley Pruden helped NET interpret the latest facts in a case which was, for other networks, too difficult for the nightly news.  Indeed, Whitewater wasn't cool.<P>
Talk radio played a hand back then. The Seper and Times reports were reliable talking points for an audience trapped between a media establishment trying to avoid Whitewater as a story and hucksters trying to exploit Whitewater for profit.  Even then much of the public new there was a story amidst the confusion.  Whitewater was a story which simply wouldn't go away.<P>
Whitewater wasn't cool then, but it became fashionable later.  As the 104th Congress began its hearings and Special Counsel Starr took over the investigation, gradually the story began to achieve its acceptance.  Seper continued his work. The editorial page added its perspective for readers of the new National Weekly edition and for Insight magazine.  Talk radio and NET continued to take calls.<P>
Finally Starr's work produced its first indictments  former business partners of the First Lady, Susan and James McDougal, and the Governor of Arkansas, Jim Guy Tucker. Conventional wisdom said the Governor and Susan McDougal would win acquittals partly because the Little Rock jury had not been sequestered and names of the jurists were published in the local papers.  Yet, Starr's efforts prevailed and the jury convicted each of the defendants.  Thus, Whitewater became "cool."<P>
Today Whitewater and its cousins, "Filegate" and "Travelgate," have become the story of the year.  Today a pool of reporters have jumped into the cool current of Whitewater.  They go to bed with visions of Pulitzer dancing in their heads. Few may realize they have a story built on the foundation of work quietly produced by the likes of Jerry Seper. To the readers of the Washington Times, the listeners of talk radio, and the viewers of NET, Whitewater was always a story.  We were Whitewater when Whitewater wasn't cool.<P>

<h2>The Communists are Going to Lose
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>



It appears to me that the Communists are about to lose the elections in   

Russia.  I say this because I have watched elections in which they have   

participated in for over 35 years.  Absolutely every time they think they   

are going to lose they begin to complain that the election process is   

rigged with fraud ahead of time.  Well that is happening now with a   

vengeance as the Communists hope to discredit any victory by Russian   

President Boris Yeltsin.<P>

Yeltsin, for his part, has been running very tough television commercials   

narrated by famous Russian actors calling to mind the days of terror   

inflicted on the Russian people by Stalin, the times of famine due to the   

Communist system, the lack of freedom to travel and worship and so on.<P>   

The pro Yeltsin narrators say of Gennady Zuganov, the Communist candidate   

for President, that the Communists now claim that they are different than   

those of old but, in fact, they are not. These American style television   

commercials have a point. While Zuganov tones down his views when he is   

speaking to Western reporters, out on the hustings when speaking to the   

party faithful he doesn't hesitate to invoke the name of Stalin and he   

makes no apologies for the Communist era which he said brought Russians   

stability.<P>

One aspect of the Russian campaign which has interesting implications is   

the effort by Boris Yeltsin's newfound electoral partner Alexander Lebed   

to denounce aspects of Western culture.  Since the fall of the Soviet   

Union in l99l, Russia has been invaded by American soap operas, American   

pornographic magazines, American R and X rated movies, American punk   

fashions and contemporary American morals.  Lebed, while somewhat friendly   

to the West politically, has denounced this trashy Western influence on   

the Russian culture and has promised that , if continued in power, he   

will do his best to rid the nation of such corrupting elements.  Lebed   

placed a strong third in the first round of the Russian elections and   

Yeltsin hired him as his security chief the next day.  Lebed has been more   

visible than Yeltsin this past week as the campaign heads to July 3rd for   

the final round.<P>

It will be interesting to see if the Russian voters respond to Lebed's   

promise to rid Russia of the degrading aspects of Western culture.  If   

they do, American politicians might take note.  While this country would   

not respond well to the authoritarian suggestions of Lebed, I think the   

climate is right for a political figure to finally have the courage to   

say "enough is enough" when it comes to the ever degrading television   

shows, movies and printed material that constantly flows forth these   

days.  There are still enough people who adhere to the Judeo Christian   

moral structure in this country to make a mighty difference if any   

credible political figure would tell them what they are anxiously waiting   

to hear. <P>

<h2>Second Thoughts About a Constitutional Convention
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>


I am about to upset a lot of people. So get your pens ready, crank up your computers, and oil your fax machines. Here we go. <P>
I am sitting here thinking about another dreadful Supreme Court decision, the 7 to 1 rendering on the VMI case which outlaws same sex educational institutions. It paves the way for women in combat and a host of other things we have fought over the years. It continues what my colleague Tom Jipping has called "the cultural Jihad." <P>
I, of course, have called for the impeachment of the majority on this court, although I know how far that will get. Still, the question is, as Lenin once said, "What is to be done?" <P>
If you watched Direct Line Wednesday night you understand that Congress will do nothing about this decision. There are constitutional remedies available to the Congress, such as withdrawing jurisdiction from the Court on certain issues, but they never, ever use them. Lets face it, after more than fifty years of watching the Court erode its power, the Congress is afraid to do anything about it. <P>
I keep thinking of what the Court has done to votes of the people such as in the Colorado homosexual rights case and in the Arkansas term limits case and on and on. I will bet that had the people in Virginia voted on VMI or the people of South Carolina voted on the Citadel they would have voted to uphold tradition. It is clear that with this Court the votes of the people dont matter. <P>
This Court keeps altering the Constitution to the point where it can no longer be recognized. They find rights which are not there. They do not respect, in any way, the 10th Amendment which reserves to the states and to the people those matters which are not specifically enumerated in the Constitution. <P>
The argument against a Constitutional Convention is that it would change our constitutional form of government. But our form of government is being changed by this Supreme Court case by case, year by year. The Court does so without the consent of the governed or even of the Congress elected by the governed. With this Court there is no Constitution unless it is found convenient to resurrect it from time to time. <P>
I know this is going to send my friend Phyllis Schlafly into orbit and I will be forever branded as a traitor to my country by various committees of correspondence who busy the fax machines and the Internet. But I have to ask the question. Can we be worse off with a Constitutional Convention elected by the people than we are with a Court that constantly undoes the work of the people? <P>
I guess I have more faith in the people than others do. I recall that the same fears which have been expressed about a national Constitutional Convention were expressed about both Maryland and Louisiana when they held such conventions to rewrite their state constitutions. No real damage was done in Maryland, despite it being one of the most liberal states in the country. Louisianas constitution came out far better after the convention than before. <P>
If my good friends at the NRA, the Christian Coalition, in pro-life groups, and a host of other groups can help win elections all around the country, why cant they help elect a majority to a Constitutional Convention? If we ran slates of delegates to such a convention on a reform ticket which included items such as term limits and a real balanced budget amendment with tax limitation and so on, Ill bet we would win a majority of the convention hands down. Maybe then we could change the Constitution to protect the unborn, insure that citizens have their rights restored on issues such as Amendment Two in Colorado, insure that the court cannot repeal human nature as they have tried to do in the VMI case, and so on.
It is true that we could lose the elections to such a convention. That is always the chance you take when the people vote. But what is the alternative? At least such a Convention would be acting on a vote of the people. The way things stand, our way of life, our Constitution, our culture, our system of government are all being changed by a Court which is responsible to no one. Do we sit here and let it happen? Or do we try to take back our country? My colleague Bill Lind wants a new political party. Well and good, but what will that accomplish if this Court takes all of our rights away in the meanwhile? <P>
Let me make something clear. I revere the work of the Founding Fathers. I think the Constitution they produced has a near sacred quality to it. I believe it produced the best government the world has seen for a century and a half. Remember that these same Founding Fathers provided for the very Constitutional Convention we are discussing. <P>
But lets face it, the era when the Constitution was respected by the Supreme Court has long been over. Several Republican Presidents have tried to appoint so called "strict constructionists" to the court to reverse what has been happening since the New Deal. It hasnt worked. The majority in the VMI case were Republican appointees. <P>
It seems to me that we have to face reality. I want the opponents of a Constitutional Convention to make the case to me that we are better off letting this runaway Court strip us of our heritage on a systematic basis, than we would be if the people had a chance to elect a convention that could express their will.
I think a national election for a convention would be a very serious affair. Ill bet it would be treated that way by the voters and it would be a remarkable opportunity to educate people about what our constitutional form of government should be. Im sorry, but I cant accept the view that we should do nothing. We mourn and we complain and we express regret at what is happening but we do nothing.
I say it is hard for me to imagine that we would be worse off than we are now with a vote of the same people who passed term limits, voted for Amendment Two in Colorado, voted for three strikes and youre out in California, and so on. <P>
Go ahead. Come at me. Lets debate this proposition. It sure is better than sitting around and ringing our hands. <P>

<h2>Clinton Dodges Another Scandal
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>







It is always nice to have friends on the Supreme Court. Bill Clinton had at least four of them which is why he won't be giving depositions this Summer in the Paul Jones sexual harassment suit. The court agreed to take up the question of whether or not a President can face a civil suit during his term in office. Now the court will decide in l997 if the decision by the court of appeals that the lawsuit may proceed is valid. Had the High court simply upheld the decision of the appeals court, the law suit would have gone ahead. <P>

But then we shouldn't be surprised. Bill Clinton's entire history is one of close calls and of voters giving him the benefit of the doubt. And it appears they are about to do so again.<P>

Of all the data I have reviewed on elections, which began with a tutorial the pollster Richard Wirthlin gave me in l970 right after then California Governor Ronald Reagan's re-election, I must say I consider some of the recent findings most remarkable.<P>

The public does understand that President Clinton is less than honest. The public believes that the White House is not telling the truth on filegate. The public believes that Hillary Clinton is lying. The public thinks that Bill Clinton is not a good role model for children. The public thinks that the Clintons have covered up their role in Whitewater. But the public says they want Bill Clinton to be President anyway.<P>

Because I rise at 4:30 every morning, I seldom watch the late night TV shows. But I didn't have to get up Saturday morning so I tuned in for a change. Non stop jokes about Bill and Hillary. Jokes about the President dating while in office. Jokes about the President's friends serving time in prison. Lots of jokes about the First Lady, and that was before the revelations about her conversations with long dead political figures. For example, in comparing music to politics, Jay Leno said that in music Dolly Parton does 9 to 5. But in politics Hillary Clinton will be doing 5 to 9. And so it goes, I am told, night after night and the audience cheers, yet they continue to favor the President's re-election. <P>

What gives here? How could voters believe someone is dishonest, has become a sort of national joke, and yet is favored to win in November.<P>

Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson thinks the problem is that the media has so devalued the Presidency that voters now believe it doesn't matter who we present as our leader to the rest of the world. Author Kevin Phillips believes that the voters are so cynical, since they believe all politicians are dishonest, that they simply are inclined to be with the devil they know rather than the devil they don't know.<P>

I think there is a third factor at work. When you quiz voters about why they favor Bill Clinton's re-election, they will tell you that he understands their problems more than his rivals. Others will say he will do more for them than his opponents. I think what we have here is the ultimate conclusion of the "me generation". Bill Clinton is the defender of the status quo as far as government benefits are concerned. So voters are saying "I know this President is dishonest, but what the heck. He'll see to it I don't get hit too hard, so I'm going to support him and frankly I don't care what happens to the rest of the country." <P>

I think back to the young man who asked the l992 Presidential candidates at one of the debates how they were going to take care of him. Instead of telling the kid to go take care of himself, the candidates all fell over themselves telling him what they were going to do for him, but Bill Clinton gave him the most sympathetic answer. <P>

I think my driver John Blackwell, who also drives a taxi part-time in Washington and thus is in touch with the real world, has the right answer. Blackwell points out that over half of the population is now dependent on a government check of one kind or another. "The voters are just looking at their own pockets and thinking that Bill Clinton will keep their checks coming", Blackwell said. I am afraid he is right. <P>

It worked in Roman times. Bread and circuses kept the population happy as their freedoms were taken away. The public doesn't want to face the bad news that we are going bankrupt as a nation. That our debt is robbing us and especially our children and grandchildren blind. In a few more years, there simply won't be any money at all to pay the bills. But, hey, that's after Bill Clinton leaves office after his second term. Why should we worry? <P>

<h2>Hillary Talks to the Dead?
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>



According to Bob Woodward's new book "The Choice", Hillary Clinton held an imaginary conversation with the late First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who died in l962. <P>

      Talking to Eleanor was the brainchild of Jean Houston, the Co-Director of the Foundation for Mind Research. <P>

      Now, of course, I wasn't present for that conversation between Hillary and Eleanor, but I can well imagine how it went. <P>

       "Oh, Eleanor", said Hillary," You just can't imagine what it is like being married to a man who almost never tells the truth". Replied Eleanor : "Come, come dear. I know exactly what it is like. In fact, that is why my husband is your husband's role model. And I must tell you it works. Take the Depression, for example. We never really did anything to solve it. In fact, things were worse in l938 than they were in l933 but people THOUGHT we had done something, and that's what is really important. You tell Bill to always sound confident. He should keep on saying things like 'the economy is in the best shape it has been in fifty years'. Now never mind that it isn't true. If he just says it often enough, people will believe it. Just think of how well he did by telling the voters in l992 that the economy was in the worst shape since the Depression. People believed him even though it was an outright lie. It's all in how you say it, my dear".<P>

           The conversation continued with Hillary asking for advice on Bosnia: "I'm not sure what we should do. My husband got us into the war over there. We promised to get our troops out before the election, but there is no way we are going to be able to do that. In fact, we may be there for years. What do we do?" Eleanor Roosevelt answered : "Well, that's a tough one. Franklin got us into the war by ignoring all of the warnings and failing to prevent Pearl Harbor. But you see, Hillary dear, we had Hitler and the Japs. You don't have enemies people can identify with. I'm afraid you have a harder task. About the only thing you can do is to start to remove the troops before the election. Send new ones quietly a few at a time and be ready to deploy lots of them the day after the election. But if people think they are coming home on schedule, they will go ahead and vote for Bill."<P>

             "Now let me ask you Eleanor, you don't mind if I call you Eleanor do you?", Hillary continued, "I feel as if I know you. I've read everything I can about you, I admire you so much." Eleanor replied "It's all right dear. We used to be more formal, but I understand the times, so go ahead call me Eleanor". <P>

               "Well", said Hillary, "I don't quite know how to raise this question. But I know you've had experience. You see Bill hasn't been exactly faithful. I mean dealing with the Paula Jones matter in public and all, how ever did you cope?" Eleanor turned somber. "Well I had one advantage over you. The press didn't pry into our personal lives in those days. The boys who covered Franklin all knew about Lucy. But they didn't say anything. All the things that have been published have seen the light years after Franklin died. In fact, decades after I died. So I never had to cope with the public humiliation of it all."<P>

               But Hillary persisted. "I'm sure you knew. How did you put up with it?" Said Eleanor in reply: "My dear. It is worth it being First Lady, especially when you have your own agenda. I did. Franklin didn't much agree with it. But he was in no position to object. In those days if I had left him, he would have been finished. So he let me do my own thing. I see that Bill lets you do what you want as well. That's good. Any time he gets testy about your doing what you want, you just remind him of what you know and how if you confirmed all the rumors, even in this day in age, he'd be packing for Tennessee". <P>

               "Arkansas", Hillary interrupted. "We're from Arkansas." Eleanor apologized. "Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I knew it was one of those states down there. Personally I preferred the North."

               Hillary went on : "I have other problems. There is the cattle futures issue and the billings at the Rose law firm and the allegations that I was the go between for people who wanted favors from Bill when he was Governor. Franklin was Governor before he was President. How did you manage these things?" Eleanor shook her head. "I'm afraid I can't help you. Women didn't hold down those kind of jobs when I was around. I will say this. I did get into trouble from time to time, and I found loss of memory to be an excellent way to handle things. No one can prove you remember anything." <P>

              "I've tried that and so far it has worked. But I'm worried", Hillary confessed. Eleanor broke into a smile. "My dear, so long as you have Bill to lie for you, don't worry. People want to believe their President. And even if his wife is unpopular, and believe me dear I was unpopular, so long as they are comforted by what their President says, they'll keep you right where you are."<P>

                "Even if I am indicted?", Hillary asked. "Well now", said Eleanor, "I don't know about that. I was careful. I never did anything they could get me for later."<P>

                "And what do I do if Bill loses?", Hillary whined. Eleanor looked puzzled. "We never had to cope with that problem. And I don't think you will either. After Bill's term, you run and then the two of you can serve longer than Franklin and me. But don't worry, there is life after the White House. I mean I did commercials for oleo margarine. I'm sure there are plenty of things you can sell. And you can always try writing a book."<P>

                  "I just did", Hillary replied. "I'm surprised you haven't heard about it. It's called 'It Takes a Village.'" <P>

                   "I'm terribly sorry", said Eleanor", But down here we don't hear about many new books. We do see MTV videos a lot, so if you make one of those I'm bound to see it. It is part of our punishment."<P>

                   "I think Bill is about to make one. Do you think he should wear boxers or briefs", Hillary asked. Eleanor pretended not to hear the question. <P>

<h2>For Less Than This Colson Went to Jail
</h2>
<P>
<P>

<P>
What a difference a couple of years makes. On May 22, 1994, White House advisor George Stephanopoulos said this of Craig Livingstone, the then director of the White House office of personnel security: "He does a terrific job. All I know is that anything that has to do with security or logistics  Craig's going to take care of it. You don't have to tell him how to do it, when to do it. Just that it needs to be done, and he does it. And he knows how to cut through the bureaucracy and get things done." Stephanopoulos told this to the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, Livingstone's home town newspaper.
<P>When confronted with the quote late last week, Stephanopoulos now says, "I don't know him that well. He's a guy that was around. He came up to me one day and said 'my paper's doing this and would you give them a quote' and I said 'sure.' I never worked with him on a campaign but he seemed competent. What can I tell you?"  As to the contention that Livingstone knows how to cut through the bureaucracy, Stephanopoulos says, "I just can't think of a specific thing he handled."
<P>Which version of the truth from the White House do you believe? This is, in fact, THE crucial question as we ponder the meaning of the issue over the hundreds of FBI files on Republicans turned over to the White House. The first spin put out by the White House was that Livingstone and Anthony Marceca were just low level bureaucrats who made a mistake.
<P>Now comes Denis Casey, the former Gary Hart for President campaign coordinator in Western Pennsylvania, who tells us that Livingstone and Marceca were busy gathering dirt on union officials who supported Walter Mondale in 1984.  They were doing this in an effort to try to blackmail the officials into switching to Hart's side to the point where Casey demanded that they be fired. The Casey testimony casts a whole different light on this issue. Livingstone and Marceca, it would seem, were professional political assassins who placed in charge of all of the sensitive material gathered by the FBI on their political opposition.
<P>Now the question is who put them in their positions? Who understood their background? To whom did they report? What did Bill Clinton know and when did he know it?
<P>Attorney General Janet Reno is absolutely right in asking that Independent Counsel Ken Strarr investigate this matter. It is not something which any person connected with the Clinton Administration can be trusted to handle. Let's remember that Chuck Colson, former Nixon White House aide, went to jail for showing a single FBI file to a reporter. We need to know why these FBI files were requested and exactly how the information therein was used.
<P>The fact that George Stephanopoulos could change his story on Livingstone so easily suggests that it is going to be very difficult getting at the truth on this issue. At the heart of the matter is no less than this question: Is the United States still a free nation where reasonable people can disagree and still continue to practice politics, or have we gone down the road to a dictatorship where if our opponents win the election, the rest of us have to live in fear over what comes next? <P>

June 17, 1996

<h2>Hope for Continued Democracy in Russia
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>The Russian people had themselves a remarkable election on Sunday. This is not a nation which has a tradition of democracy and yet turnout was higher than for most nations which do not make voting mandatory.
<P>Terrorists tried, with a series of bombs throughout the nation, to intimidate the voters. They did not do so. And while the election wasnt as fair as our elections, since the incumbent Boris Yeltsin controlled much of the television media, there is, nevertheless, substantial evidence that most of the Russian people followed the election.  There is also evidence that most of the Russian people were aware of the positions of the different candidates. 
<P>Since no candidate received the required 50% plus of the vote to be elected outright, there will be a runoff in three weeks between Yeltsin and Communist party boss Gannady Zyuganov. A word about that election in a moment, but first some thoughts on a few of the other candidates who ran.
<P>The surprise candidate who did far better than expected was General Alexander Lebed.   Lebed, on the one hand, is a supporter of democracy and free markets. On the other hand, he promises an authoritarian regime which will get tough with criminals. He often cites Chile under Gen. Pinochet as the appropriate model for Russia to prosper. The outcome in the runoff will probably be determined by where his votes go. Although Lebed is not pro-Communist, many of his supporters favor the Communist candidate Zyuganov because like Gen. Lebed, Zyuganov promises to bring back law and order. 
<P>Vladimir Zhirinovsky was the big loser in this election. The Russian voters apparently now see him for the fool that he is. He received only about 7% of the vote, a far cry from his showing in the last two parliamentary elections. No doubt he will favor Zyuganov in the runoff. But even if all of his voters go that route, it wont be enough to put Zyuganov over the top. 
<P>The democratic reformers did make somewhat of a showing with their candidate Gregory Yavilinsky who drew more votes than Zhirinovsky. Yavilinsky may reluctantly support Yeltsin in the runoff. Therefore, he could emerge in a new Yeltsin cabinet if there is one. 
<P>Meanwhile, Mikhail Gorbachev got so few votes that he hardly made the charts. This comes as a surprise only to Gorbachev. When Gorbachev left office he was terribly unpopular but he never believed that. His place secure in history as the man who opened up the process in Russia, he would have been well off to try to play the role of elder statesman. Instead he insisted on running because he believed the people were demanding his return. Now his stature is so diminished that it is clear he will never again play a role in Russian politics. 
<P>The runoff election is likely to be very close. First of all, some who voted for other candidates in this round will simply stay home. They feel they have no choice between Yeltsin and Zyuganov. Second, supporters of Yavilinsky, Sergei Filatov, and other Democrats will likely, very reluctantly, support Yeltsin. However, there are not enough of those votes to get Yeltsin the extra 15% he needs to win. 
<P>That is where Gen. Lebed comes in. Lebed will likely determine the outcome. If he goes with Yeltsin, he may be able to deliver enough of his vote to make the difference. If he goes with Zyuganov, he could give the Communist leader a real shot at being elected. 
<P>While the 35% of the vote is not exactly a ringing endorsement, it is remarkable that Yeltsin managed to get the most votes in the first round. Yeltsin has had to bear the burden of the enormous changes which have been visited on the Russian people these past five years. At one point he had sunk to only 8% in the public opinion polls and was written off as politically dead. The fact that he now has a fighting chance to win the runoff makes him the real "come back kid" of the democratic process. 
<P>The joke going around Moscow these days is that on the morning after the election, a Yeltsin aide comes to him and says he has good news and bad news.
<P>"Whats the bad news?" Yeltsin asks. 
<P>"The Communists got 55% of the vote," the aide says. 
<P>Yeltsin makes a terrible face and asks, "Then whats the good news?" 
<P>"You got 65% of the vote!" the aide declares.
This election may not have been totally honest, but it is a far cry from the rigged-in-advance kind of elections the Soviets staged for the 70 years they were in power.
<P>Russia took a major step forward in its fledgling democracy with this election. Now the voters in the runoff will have a choice between continuing to edge forward, no matter how erratically, or to try to restore the past. My bet is, that despite all the hardships they are enduring, the Russian people will not try to turn back the clock. <P>

<h2>Schott Censorship Sets Bad Precedent
</h2>
<P>
<P>Schott Censorship Sets Bad Precedent
<P>What is going on here? On the same day that a federal appeals court rules that the attempt by Congress to keep children from getting access to pornography on the Internet is unconstitutional, baseball owners have deprived Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott of the right to run her own baseball club for two years.
So let me understand this. It is okay to make all sorts of filthy material readily available to kids via the Internet, but the owner of a baseball team doesnt have the right to say stupid things.<P>

Far be it from me to defend the things Marge Schott has said. Most of her remarks display ignorance of history and disregard for the concept of the United States as a melting pot. But so what? Is this a crime?
Baseball owners have made it clear that Schott was disciplined, not for anything she did in connection with the management of the Reds, but because of "insensitivity." Wow! If insensitivity is a crime, some of our greatest athletic coaches will be soon out of jobs.<P>

It seems to me that the game of baseball, once known as Americas favorite pastime, has succumbed to a case of extreme political correctness. Schott has made some highly questionable remarks about Asians, for example. But no charge has been made that she discriminated against any Asian employee who might have worked for the Reds.<P>

It is quite one matter if Marge Schott were charged with discriminating against minorities who worked for her. That, after all, violates the law. But expressing her opinion? Louis Farrakhan has opinions which make me physically ill. No one, however, suggests he isnt entitled to his opinions even though they exude racial and religious hatred. So why pick on Marge Schott?<P>
If patrons are offended by what Schott says, they can boycott Cincinnati Reds games. Thats the American way. But to punish the lady by taking away her property rights because she said "insensitive" things is anything but American.<P>

I am sure that acting Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig feels good about himself now that he has exhibited this burst of political correctness. Well, he shouldnt.<P>

The precedent Selig has set may well come back to haunt him. Thats because the dictators of political correctness are always changing their standards. Who knows, maybe Selig will one day be deprived of the right to operate the Milwaukee Brewers because of something he says, which by todays standards is perfectly acceptable.<P>

As to Marge Schott, she ought to find the same ACLU lawyers who handled the Internet case. Ill bet the courts would overturn the decision of the baseball owners in a flash if they were given half a chance.<P>

<h2>"Dole Trashes his Base"
</h2>
<P>

<P>Bob Dole must have a death wish. His campaign seemed to get recharged when he announced his resignation from the Senate a few weeks ago. Last weekend he even seemed to forge a compromise on the abortion issue which everyone from Christie Todd Whitman, the liberal Governor of New Jersey, to Pat Buchanan, Doles rival for the GOP nomination, could live with. 
<P>The compromise would have retained the pro-life language in the GOP platform as it has been since 1980, but it would have included in the preamble a declaration of tolerance for opposing views on not only the abortion issue but other matters as well. It was a shrewd compromise which gave something to both sides who are deeply divided on the issue. Dole was widely praised for his leadership on the issue.
<P>No sooner had that matter been put to rest than the presumptive Presidential nominee re-opened the issue. Dole now insists that the so-called "declaration of tolerance" be included, not in the preamble, but as an amendment to the pro-life plank. That would have the effect of rendering the pro-life position of the party as meaningless. Moreover, such a declaration of tolerance wouldnt apply to other issues that divide Republicans including NAFTA and GATT to the assault weapons ban to term limits. Dole denounced Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council in ferocious terms, the likes of which he has never unleashed on Bill Clinton. 
<P>This move was taken as a declaration of war by social conservatives. Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition, who has been very friendly to Dole throughout the primary season, told Dole in plain English that what Dole was proposing was unacceptable. Later, a spokesman for the organization suggested that if that position prevails, Christian Coalition will have to sit out the Presidential election. Christian Coalition oriented voters constitute about a quarter of the Republican vote.
<P>As if that werent bad enough. Dole, in his departing speech from the Senate which was carried live by a number of the networks, went through a litany of the programs he had helped to pass during his years in the Senate. Almost all of them were liberal programs such as food stamps and the Americans for Disabilities Act which were fought hard by conservatives. As Steve Moore of the CATO Institute put it : "Some of us have tried hard to find a reason to vote for Bob Dole. By emphasizing terrible programs that we all fought, he is just reminding us why we cant vote for him." 
<P>Indeed Doles speech had that effect among his hard core base. "It is clear that in a Dole Presidency we will get the same policies we are getting under Clinton. The difference is that there will be no resistance to those policies if they are pushed by Dole," one veteran conservative Republican pronounced. "Let him get elected with the votes of liberals," said another.
<P>But Dole wasnt content in just alienating his activist base. He went on to put distance between himself and the freshmen House Members who have been the only breath of fresh air to hit the Republican party in years. In a broadcast interview, Dole said the freshmen had gone too far in the areas of education and the environment. That caused Rep. Mark Neumann of Wisconsin to send a message to Dole: "If that is the party line, let me know and Ill go and do something else. I have no intention of running against both Bill Clinton and Bob Dole this year." Neumann, who was elected in the closest race percentage wise in the nation in 1994, said Doles comments have put him in an impossible position politically, one which cannot be sustained in his district. 
<P>The freshmen, the only group to stand up and fight for principle in Washington in recent memory, now find themselves isolated from their party standard bearer. What Dole has done is to play right into the hands of the Democrats who have denounced the freshmen as "extremist." One Dole staffer suggested that Bob Dole wouldnt be all that unhappy if some of the freshmen were defeated for re-election because then Dole wouldnt have to deal with them when he becomes President. 
<P>There is a rule in politics which is almost never violated by successful candidates for President. First, consolidate your base. Then move outward from there. Bob Dole has spent the last week carpet bombing his base. If he wins the Presidency, it is clear that Dole wants to do so without the Christian right, principled economic conservatives, or the tough minded House freshmen. A Dole Presidency under those conditions, which no doubt would be accompanied by a Democratic Congress, would produce more victories for liberalism than Bill Clinton could ever hope to deliver.  As Eric Licht, President of Coalitions for America put it, "Bill Clinton couldnt pass national health insurance, but Bob Dole could well do so." 
<P>I guess I am always open to being shown new ways to put together a winning electoral coalition. If Bob Dole can be elected President by trashing the heart of the party which nominated him, it will truly be an election for the history books. <P>

<h2>Justice Thomas Bests His Detractors
</h2>
<P>

<P>
<P>Three cheers to Justice Clarence Thomas for ignoring my advice. I talked to the Justice last Thursday (he is one of the three I dont want impeached) and suggested that he not appear at an awards ceremony in suburban Washington because it would give too much of a platform to his opponents. Instead, I suggested, he ought to have a special picnic for the eighth grade students at the Supreme Court where he would be  in control of the situation.
<P>You will recall that Justice Thomas was invited by students at the Pullen School to speak at an awards ceremony held at Central High School in Prince Georges County, Maryland. The students had invited him after meeting with him while on a tour of the Supreme Court where he was the only Justice to take the time to visit with them in his chambers.
<P>When school board member Kenneth Johnson heard about the invitation, he went ballistic. Johnson said he would disrupt the appearance if Thomas came to the ceremony. That led the school Superintendent to un-invite Thomas. The school board, however, overruled the Superintendent and re-invited Thomas. Thomas was silent about his intentions right up until the time of the event last night.
<P>Armstrong Williams, the host of "The Right Side" on radio and on NET, and I both talked with Thomas late last week and got the impression that he was seriously considering not making the event. I suggested that if he went, the lead story would be the protest against him and his message to the students would be lost. Thats why I recommended the alternative, which would be a special event just for the students and no one else. Thomas could have legally kept the protesters out of the court.
<P>In retrospect I am glad Thomas ignored my advice. The likes of Kenneth Johnson should not have been able to silence the Justice by promising disruption. In fact, Johnson was able to muster only 80 protesters who were confined to another part of the building. Johnson complained bitterly that because Thomas had hinted, through Armstrong Williams, that he might not come, Johnson couldnt get people to turn out. Maybe Thomas should be in charge of our military strategy as well!
<P>Thomas told the parents and children who, by the way, gave him standing ovations, "I deeply regret having brought some unwanted attention to this wonderful ceremony." In fairness, Thomas didnt cause the attention. His detractors did.
<P>Late last night, following the appearance of Thomas at the ceremony, I did a half hour segment of Armstrong Williams syndicated radio show. Just about every caller was against Thomas. Williams and I did battle with them. The party line against Thomas is that he is a hypocrite because he is the beneficiary of affirmative action programs and now he wants them eliminated. I dispute that theory. Read Justice Thomas opinions. They are among the most profound ever rendered by any Justice.
<P>I do not think Justice Thomas needed affirmative action to get where he is. I think he succeeded on his own merits. One caller insisted, "I dont want Justice Thomas as a role-model for my daughter." I asked him if he wanted Louis Farrakhan as a role model, since the same Kenneth Johnson who promised to disrupt a Thomas appearance sponsored a resolution before the Prince Georges County School Board which would have given teachers and students a day off to participate in the Million Man March. The caller said my point was irrelevant.
<P>There is something to the intensity of some of these callers and protesters which is beyond all reason. Maybe the Rev. Imogene Stewart, a  Black Washington civic activist who appeared on "The Right Side" last Friday, is on to something. She contends that while some in the black community cloak their opposition to Thomas in the rhetoric of affirmative action, what they are really angry about is that he married a white woman.
<P>Well, whatever it is, Thomas showed up his detractors. He proved to be a man of his word. He was gracious and self effacing. He gave the students good advice  such as "remember that good manners will open doors that the best education will not and cannot. Even though you may have strong feelings about matters, that does not give you license to have bad manners." Great advice. Kenneth Johnson can you hear what Justice Thomas said over the clatter of your own rhetoric?<P>

June 10, 1996

<h2>
Some Freshmen Have Some Problems
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>Ive said a fair amount over the past year and a half about the freshman class of Republicans, that eager group of legislators that swept into office in the Republican landslide year of 1994. As a group they have performed well for the nation. Unfortunately, their elders for the most part were not as eager to make the changes these freshmen felt they had a mandate to make. So the overall record of the 104th Congress is disappointing to say the least, but as a group, the freshmen are not to blame for this unfortunate fact. 
<P>As I say, taken as a group, the freshmen Republicans are an impressive lot. Individually, however, some of them have problems. There is Congressman Jon Christensen of Nebraska, whose campaign centered around family values. He wasnt in office for a year when he filed for divorce and took the unusual step of forcing his wife to file an affidavit that she had been unfaithful. She now is contesting the divorce, saying she doesnt want to break up the marriage. He says it is all over. He is in one tough race for re-election. 
<P>There is, of course, the soap opera like drama of Enid and Joe Waldholtz. Joe is on his way to the federal pen and the big question is whether or not he takes Enid with him. She has already dumped Joe and has even changed her name back to Enid Green, but she wisely chose not to run for the House again. 
<P>Then there is the very strange case of Rep. Wes Cooley of Oregon. Cooley came out of nowhere to win a state senate seat in 1992. When Rep. Bob Smith unexpectedly announced his retirement in 1994, everyone and his mother got in the race for the Republican nomination for Congress. Cooley won a seven way primary with under 30% of the vote and went on to win the rural conservative district rather handily with 57% of the vote. 
<P>Cooley is as affable a person as you would want to meet. You can well imagine him operating a country store, sitting around the cracker barrel and spinning tales. The problem for Cooley is that he is a Congressman now and people take what he says for real. 
<P>Cooley already has admitted that he lied about being married to the woman he now calls his wife. It seems that if the couple wasnt married, she could still collect widows benefits from a previous marriage. But after he got elected to the state senate, Cooley thought perhaps they ought to regularize things. He had what was called an anniversary party, but it would appear that when he was said to be renewing his vows, he was, in fact, actually getting married. We dont know for sure because Cooley has gone to the extraordinary length of having the date of his marriage kept sealed by the courts. 
<P>Cooleys biggest problem stems from his claim that he served in a special unit of the military during the Korean war. He claims that the Pentagon lost all of his records. He also claims that every single person with whom he served is now dead. The unit was a secret one, he says, so he cant disclose anything about it. When asked to at least recite some recollections from his days in the service, Cooley says his memory fails him. 
<P>Cooley blames all of his troubles on the news media and left wing opponents. Now lest you think I have taken up unsubstantiated claims by a media out to get the Oregon Congressman, consider this: Coalitions for America, a lobby organization of which I am the national chairman, holds a weekly luncheon in this building which is attended by Members of Congress and various conservative and pro-family groups. Among the attendees of this luncheon from time to time has been Rep. Wes Cooley. So when the allegations against him broke, I expected that he would want to give his side of the story. <P>
Instead, Cooley said nothing. Finally I called on him and asked him if there wasnt something he wanted to tell his colleagues and philosophical allies. He said that all of the charges against him were false and made up by his enemies. I told him that if such charges were really false that we were the sort of people who would go to bat for him, we just needed to be equipped with the facts. He promised he would supply them just as he promised he would hold press briefings to refute the charges against him. No facts were produced and no such press briefings were held. <P>
Lets be perfectly candid about it. Wes Cooley is lying. Former Rep. Bob Smith, who campaigned hard for Cooley after he won his primary, now says he is embarrassed by Cooley and has called on him to step down. Cooley says he will let the voters decide. They will indeed. His Democratic opponent now has a commanding lead in a district which is solidly conservative and Republican.<P>
The fact that Enid Green and Cooley vote right is beside the point. Members of Congress need to be role models. People in the community should be able to look up to them as prototype citizens.<P>
Enid Green at least had the decency to retire, although she should have resigned from her seat because she clearly obtained it by fraud. Cooley deceived the voters of Oregon by making exaggerated claims about his service to his country, about his education, about his marital status, and who knows what else. Cooley, having just won renomination for second term, should now step down and permit the Republican party to name some one else to take his place. By the way, in his district more people voted for others on the primary ballot than those voting to renominate Cooley.<P>
This is clearly a case where "None of the Above" or NOTA is badly needed. These conservative voters should have an additional choice between Cooley and his Democratic opponent who will vote against their wishes. They ought to have the chance to vote for "None of the Above" and void the election. But since NOTA is not on the Oregon ballot, it is now up to Cooley. Former Congressman Smith says now that he has spoken out against Cooley, no doubt Cooley will label him as part of a great conspiracy against him. Thats what Cooley told us at our lunch  that a great conspiracy was out to get him. Sorry, Congressman. The only thing that is out to get you are the lies you have told, the stories you have made up, the deceptions you have concocted. If you care at all for your country, instead of just yourself, then resign.  Resign so that your district, as conservative as it is, doesnt contribute to the possibility of the Democrats re-taking the Congress. <P>
After so many years of telling so many lies, you may believe all of your own stories, Congressman. Thats fine. Retire to your ranch where no doubt the dumb animals will give you the attention you deserve.

<h2>
Third-party Candidate Would Force the Issues
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>Former Colorado Governor Dick Lamm has announced that he is joining the Reform Party of Ross Perot and has suggested that if Perot himself does not run for President, he (Lamm) just might do so. I hope he does. Not that I could vote for the former Governor of my adopted state. His positions on some of the social issues preclude that. But Dick Lamm is one very forthright and candid fellow. 
<P>Unlike Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, Lamm is willing to frankly discuss the need to get entitlements under control. Dick Lamm doesnt mind touching the so called third rail of American politics, namely Social Security. Governor Lamm is willing to tackle the enormous problem of the trillions of dollars in unfunded mandates. Lamm will discuss, while the others will not, the effect that our crushing national debt will have on future generations. Governor Lamm is not afraid to raise the conflict of interest questions which plague both political parties. He may be wrong on some things, but he is one honest fellow. 
<P>Dick Lamm, barring some remarkable turn of events, wont be elected President if he is out there running on a third party ticket. But Dick Lamm can do an immense service to the American public by forcing the major parties to face up to the issues he raises. True, Perot has raised some of the same issues. But Perot is regarded as an eccentric. Lamm is non-threatening, yet highly articulate. He was very popular among voters in both parties when he was Governor of Colorado, even though he frequently said the unthinkable. 
<P>Numbers, charts, graphs, and even the reality of the impending bankruptcy of Medicare have not forced the major parties to face the truth. Americas debt is killing its future. But Dick Lamm, if he turns out to be the Reform Party candidate, will force the debate which America should have been having on these issues since 1960, indeed since the 1930s. 
<P>America badly needs this debate. Our future depends on it. Thats why members of all parties, regardless of philosophy, ought to be cheering on Governor Lamm. If he runs, and raises the issues the other candidates refuse to face, the entire political landscape will change. Then maybe, just maybe, the 1996 election will have a lasting impact. <P>

<h2>
Virginia Primary a Test of Loyalty
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>A visitor from another state who might have happened upon one of Senator John Warners television commercials, aimed at voters in next Tuesdays Virginia Republican primary, would probably think that Warner is the conservative candidate. The Warner commercial talks about tradition and how proud he is to be a part of Virginias venerable conservatism. But the record of three term Senator John Warner suggests he is anything but a true blue conservative. 
<P>Warners election was a fluke. In 1978, the newly found conservative majority in the Republican party nominated the young, articulate, and very attractive party chairman Dick Obenshain for the Senate. Obenshain seemed to be on the road to victory. But Obenshain was tragically killed when his light plane crashed in the Virginia countryside, leaving the party without a nominee for the Senate at the ninth hour of the election content. John Warner, who had spent a huge amount of money in trying to win the nomination, but who was gracious in defeat and had pledged to support Obenshain, was drafted as the GOP nominee.  
<P>Warners campaign was going nowhere and the conservatives who had picked Obenshain declined to support him. My longtime friend Dick Scaife of Pittsburgh called me and asked if I would put together a meeting of conservatives with Warner. I did so on October 7th of 1978. It was a contentious meeting which lasted two and a half hours. Warner ended up pledging to vote conservative on every issue that was raised from the Equal Rights Amendment to abortion and the SALT treaty with the Soviets. Conservatives got behind Warner and he pulled off the closest senate election in Virginia history. 
<P>Warner kept most of his promises during his first term although he had to be reminded of them from time to time. When he came up for re-election in 1984, he hardly had opposition. It was during his second term that he moved to the left. He opposed, for example, Ronald Reagans nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. On many crucial votes, he could be counted on by the liberals if they needed him. When he won his third term in 1990, nearly unopposed, he decided to go the distance. Up to that point, Warner had pretty much stayed out of Republican politics in the state of Virginia. 
<P>Looking at himself as invincible, the onetime husband of actress Elizabeth Taylor, waded in knee deep. When conservatives prevailed and nominated home school association executive Mike Ferris as their candidate for Lt. Governor, Warner refused to support him. Ferris lost narrowly to Don Beyer, the man who will be the Democratic standard bearer for Governor next year. 
<P>Then when some conservatives put forth the candidacy of Oliver North for the Senate against Senator Chuck Robb, Warner backed Norths intra-party rival, former Reagan budget director Jim Miller. Miller lost narrowly to North. So Warner went out and recruited former Virginia Attorney General Marshall Coleman to run as an Independent. Coleman drew just enough votes away from North to send Chuck Robb back to the Senate for another six years. So Miller, who had enjoyed Warners support in 1994, decided that was too much for him and declared his candidacy against Warner.
<P>Warners incumbency has drawn big bucks and Miller has not had the funds to run an aggressive campaign. Still, many conservatives are very bitter about Warners betrayal of their candidates. Republican National Committeeman Morton Blackwell, just overwhelmingly re-elected to a third term to that post last week-end at a state convention, said that if the Republicans re-nominate Warner, "we ought to take up a collection and erect, on Monument Avenue in Richmond, a statue of Benedict Arnold." 
<P>Warner, for his part, is openly courting Democrats to vote for him in the primary. Virginia has no party registration so anyone may vote in this primary. Polls show Warner ahead by a large margin but the Warner folks are worried. Moral indignation against Warner runs so high among activists that if they turn out and Warner supporters take his election for granted, Miller just might pull an upset.
<P>Miller is a solid down the line conservative but a colorless campaigner who has failed to excite people. Warner enjoys so much support among Democrats, that the Democratic nominee for the Senate, Mark Warner (no relation) is given no chance to win. 
<P>Still the contest in Virginia boils down to this: in this last half of the last decade of the 20th Century, is loyalty still a virtue?  Many Republicans say that Warner turned his back on them and his party and he has no right now to turn to them to seek another term in the Senate. When the votes are counted on Tuesday, it will be known if dancing with the girl who brought you to the party is still in vogue or if Republicans prefer someone who is more loyal to the Democrats and to himself than to the party whose label he reluctantly wears.<P>

<h2>
Qualifying Welfare Reform
</h2>
<P>
Guest Commentary by Rep Mark Neuman<P>

<P>This week in the House, a very important issue will be debated about a welfare reform plan known as W-2 Wisconsin Works.  
<P>While this plan is certainly about welfare reform, it is also about a much bigger, perhaps much more important issue.  Its about taking power out of the hands of Washington bureaucrats and giving it back to the people.  It is about whether you control what goes on in your state, or whether the Washington bureaucrats will micro-manage every facet of your lives.  When the House passes this bill this week, we take the first major step toward saying "no" to Big Government and federal bureaucrats and saying "yes" putting power back in the hands of the people.
<P>Governor Tommy Thompson of my state has written a welfare reform plan which, I believe, could easily serve as a model for all states to follow.  
<P>This plan was debated for 18 months in Wisconsin.  It was the subject of countless public hearings and meetings.  And then it was overwhelmingly endorsed and passed by both Houses of the Wisconsin legislature  with bipartisan support  both Democrats and Republicans put their stamp of approval on this welfare reform plan.  
<P>But now, many inside the beltway want Washington bureaucrats to tear it apart.  
<P>Washington bureaucrats have grabbed so much power from the states recently,  that Wisconsin needs federal approval before the plan is allowed to be implemented.  That is why I have introduced legislation in the House that allows this plan, which President Clinton himself called "one of the boldest yet," to be put into action in Wisconsin.
<P>While I believe Governor Thompsons welfare reform plan is an excellent one, my legislation doesnt force any other state to adopt it.  It simply clears the way for Wisconsin to move ahead with its own welfare reforms.  
<P>This welfare reform plan was researched, written, debated and passed into law by the citizens of Wisconsin and their elected representatives.  It underwent the scrutiny of numerous public hearings and 18 months of public debate.  And as I mentioned, it was overwhelmingly passed with bipartisan support in the Wisconsin legislature.  
<P>Each House passed it with at least a two-thirds vote.  Further, Governor Thompsons welfare reform plan was enthusiastically endorsed by President Clinton in his weekly radio address just three weeks ago.
<P>But as I said, regardless of the merits of this bill, this legislation represents a much bigger issue: and that is the issue of returning power back to you  the people.
<P>When I came to this Congress in 1995  along with 72 other freshmen  we had two very specific goals in mind: 
<ul>
<LI>balance the budget; 
<LI>and reduce the size, scope, power and influence of the federal government. 
</ul>
<P>We were given a mandate from the people to get Washington off their backs and reduce the burdens and regulations Washington routinely imposes upon them.  My constituents are tired of mandates from Washington; they are fed up with the massive tax burden; and they are sick of Washingtons wasteful spending habits that put their children and grandchildren further and further into debt.  
<P>But this freshmen class is changing the way Washington works.  As I mentioned several weeks ago on this program, we are making great strides in balancing the budget and reducing wasteful Washington spending.  And this week the Senate takes another try at passing a constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget  a measure which I wholeheartedly support.
<P>And now, with the legislation I have introduced this week, this Congress is taking a very important step in taking power and  influence out of the hands of Washington bureaucrats and returning it to you, the people who sent us here.  
<P>Some would have you believe that only the folks in Washington can have a monopoly on compassion.  Only they can truly see what the people out in the country really need.  Only Washington bureaucrats are fit to determine the needs of the people in Wisconsin and elsewhere.
<P>Folks, thats just silly.  Governor Thompson, along with a bipartisan effort of both Democrats and Republicans in Wisconsin approved this welfare reform plan.  They know what is best for the people they represent, not the bureaucrats in Washington who never have to face the consequences of regulations they impose.  
<P>But now the Washington bureaucrats cant stand not having their fingerprints on this welfare reform plan.  They want to review every detail.  They want to prescribe for you and for me what is best for us.
<P>This issue of welfare reform, perhaps more than any other, demonstrates the need to strip Washington of the immense power it now holds.   
<P>When we pass this welfare reform measure, it will open the door for other states to say "no" to mandates from Washington and "yes" to the wishes of the citizens. <P>

An Old Dog Learns New Tricks

<P>
<P>An Old Dog Learns New Tricks
<P>Ever since Bob Dole became Senate Majority Leader in 1985 I have had a running argument with him. I often told Dole to bring measures to the floor of the Senate for a vote, regardless of whether or not you have enough Senators willing to pass the bills. By losing, you win. Those votes would reveal the liberals for what they are and help elect more conservatives to the Senate.<P>
Dole disagreed. He didnt want to vote on anything unless he thought he had the votes to pass it. That is why he and his chief of staff Sheila Burke always sought the lowest common denominator legislation. The less controversial, the better the chance to rack up a big win. Of course, the less controversial, the less chance of accomplishing anything with the legislation. Historic opportunities were lost in many fields because the legislation Dole usually got passed was so bipartisan that it demonstrated no differences between the parties. I argued that without this contrast, voters would have no incentive to add to Doles ranks. He never seemed to get it, that is, until now.<P>
There is a great irony in the way Bob Dole will finish out his last week as the Senate Republican Leader. He will bring up measures, including the Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution, which have no chance of passage. In doing so, Dole will be trying to get across to the American voters some of the main differences between the parties. Dole has dared President Clinton to help get the last two votes needed to pass the Balanced Budget Amendment through the Senate. However, the President opposes the Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution. <P>
Who says you cant teach an old dog new tricks? Dole now seems to understand, albeit during the last moments of his Senate Leadership, that you can win by losing. I honestly believe, had this been done more of the time, with thorough preparation and lots of prolonged debate, the public would finally see who was on which side of the different debates and would act accordingly at the next election. The fact that meaningless bipartisan, vanilla legislation would pass the Senate by big margins only served to confuse the electorate. All sides could take credit for almost nothing. No wonder so many incumbents were re-elected. <P>
Now at the eleventh hour Dole is going to lose in the Senate in a very high profile way. But in losing he may gain points with the American voter.<P>
Although Dole has seemed to learn something new at this last moment, in some things he is sticking to the past. Chief of Staff Sheila Burke, it seems, may end up in the Dole campaign after all. <P>
Some, such as American Conservative Union Chairman David Keene, say this just proves Bob Dole is loyal to his friends. Perhaps. I think it proves that Bob Dole does not believe he can get along without Sheila Burke after having become so dependent on her over these last few years. Keene says that Sheila Burke never pursued her own agenda, but rather she served Bob Dole by doing exactly what he wanted done. If that is the case, then Dole is, indeed, a lot more liberal than his voting record suggests. <P>
At any rate, we will soon learn the truth. Since Doles announced resignation from the Senate, the Dole campaign seems to have found new life and has begun to develop a consistent message. If Sheila Burke is truly the team player her defenders claim she is, she will go along with all of it and blend right in. Then Sheila, old Senate dog that she is, will have learned new tricks too. <P>
On the other hand, if Sheila behaves as she has over the past years in Doles office, she will begin to impose herself on various aspects of the campaign. If you read news accounts about how Burke is trying to get the Republican platform liberalized, then you will understand that it is the same old Sheila at work. And if David Keene is correct, she will be doing so at Doles bidding. <P>
Im encouraged that Dole has finally caught on to how you can win in the long run by losing in the short run. Now lets see if his new found wisdom rubs off on Sheila. Hope springs eternal, as the saying goes. <P>

<h2>
Phony Jurist Takes Reporters for a Ride
</h2>
<P>
<P>On Friday morning I was driving to the NET offices when ABC radio news, at 9 a.m. Eastern, broadcast that one of the jurors in the Whitewater case in Little Rock had said she had read about the defendants before the trial and had a negative impression of them. What happened at the trial confirmed that view.<P>
I was stunned. If that statement were true, it meant big time trouble for prosecutor Ken Starr. Subsequently I heard the same story on another radio network and on CNN. I asked a couple of attorneys for their opinion and they told me that if such a juror had indeed come forward, it meant that the defense had solid grounds to get the convictions overturned.<P>
As viewers of "Paul Talk" know, we discussed this story on the show. Others had heard the same story and called in to ask questions. One viewer raised the possibility that perhaps this had been a planted juror  not an unreasonable suggestion under the circumstances. As I answered the questions I was thinking that the Clintons must be the luckiest people on the face of the earth and such a development, if true, could effect the plans of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr to move forward on other cases.<P>
Friday night I was preoccupied with the wedding rehearsal dinner of my son, Steve, so I really didnt  pay close attention to newscasts, although I did hear one or two. On early Saturday morning when our two Washington papers arrived, I expected to see this story on the front page. Perhaps it would be a banner headline in the Washington Post. I was puzzled when I saw nothing about it but the wedding was a few hours away and our household was preoccupied with other thoughts. Again, with the reception going on into late evening, I didnt pay much attention to newscasts.<P>
When the Sunday papers arrived and I saw nothing of this story I knew there was something wrong. The Post, as a matter of fact, ran a four page spread, not including the beginning of the story on page one, to the effect that Hillary Clinton may now be in real trouble because her public statements do not match the facts in the Whitewater case. I dont remember pages of coverage like this in the Post since Watergate.<P>
In any case, I began to search for the story of what happened to the juror. I listened to radio newscasts. I heard nothing. Finally, after church and before leaving home for a graduation party, there was the story on CNNs Headline News, almost all the way through the news segment.<P>
It seems that the prejudicial statement which had been printed in the newspapers about the Whitewater trial was made not by an actual juror but by a woman of the same name as one of the jurors. The media kept hounding this woman, insisting that she was the real juror, despite her protestations that she was not. Finally, she became annoyed that they didnt believe her and she decided to go along with their demands for a statement. That was when she said what was quoted on the various newscasts which I had heard. <P>
In short, the so called mainstream media had been had. I picked up my information from them which resulted in my comments on Fridays show. I did add the caveat that my predictions would be true IF the woman had been quoted accurately. Nevertheless, I accepted as true what they had broadcast. So my apologies to all the viewers of "Direct Line" who went about their week-end thinking that the Whitewater convictions would be overturned and that even Governor Tucker might not resign the governorship of Arkansas after all.<P>
What of the responsibility of the networks, who promoted this story, to broadcast the fact that they had been had on their same newscasts? Although I was preoccupied, I did hear several newscasts on Saturday as we were going to and from the church and the reception and back home. But I heard not a word about this from the same news organizations which had made the story a big deal the day before.<P>
What of the newspapers which were giving extensive coverage to Whitewater? Why was there not a word that the electronic media had been taken? An attorney I discussed this case with at last nights graduation party told me that the real juror would probably have a good slander case against the media which broadcast information, damaging to her reputation, when they were quoting someone else. The real juror, so far as I know, has made no comment. Maybe she is busy talking to her lawyers.<P>
Someone ought to hold the broadcast news organizations accountable for what they did. That includes NET. None of us checked ourselves to determine if, in fact, a juror had made this statement before we broadcast it. It was the height of irresponsibility for them to have broadcast what they did and it was, frankly, irresponsible of me to have just repeated it without a call to Ken Starrs office to verify the story. The only thing I can say in our defense is that we dont have the huge news departments that the other networks have, and I, unfortunately, have almost no time to prepare for my show since I do this as a sideline, second to my duties as the CEO of NET as well as the CEO of the Free Congress Foundation.<P>
I hope all of us involved have learned a lesson about old fashioned journalism. Verify your story before airing it. I should not have assumed that because I had heard the story on three networks it was gospel. For that I profoundly apologize to my viewers. You deserved better. And all I can promise is that I will do my best to see that we dont repeat the same mistake again. Thats all for Direct Line for tonight.<P>

"Elite Hits Justice Thomas Again"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas was invited to speak next month at the Thomas G. Pullen Creative and Performing Arts School in Maryland.  This week, school officials say they have now "uninvited" Justice Thomas.  They have told him not to address the schools June 10 awards ceremony. The reason: because of  threats of a protest.
<P>``Several parents and other community members ... expressed their concern about a possible visit by Justice Thomas and in fact, threatened to stage some kind of protest, Chris Cason, a spokesman for the Prince Georges County school system in suburban Maryland, said Wednesday.
<P>In short, Maryland school officials have told a member of the United States Supreme Court he is suddenly no longer welcome at their event because the school system is now worried about even the threat of a protest from several people.  What the leaders of this school system have done is shameful. They have dishonored their original commitment to Justice Thomas and by doing so they have dishonored themselves as well as the school system they are supposed to represent. They have chosen to cower to threats of a few rather than stand on the principle of their original commitment.
<P>The action by Marylands Prince Georges County school system sends a chilling message to students. In effect what the school system says by this is that children must heed the bullying threats of the few in order to get along. It says children must put aside doing what is right in favor of doing what is safe. The action signals to children that freedom of speech for the many can be shouted down even by the threatened protest of an elite few.
<P>Of course, it is no accident that the uninvited Justice is Clarence Thomas, who is, by the way, one the most principled jurists ever named to the bench.  You see, unlike the leaders of this Maryland school district, Justice Thomas is not politically correct. His actions are not dictated by the threats of the radical few. In decision after decision on the bench, he has proven an unwavering loyalty to one thing: the United States Constitution. Because of that, almost daily, Justice Thomas is pummeled by the liberal media which hates the idea of a black conservative holding a such a powerful position.
<P>But theres one thing in particular that Justice Thomas has going for him: he doesnt care what they think. In a meeting several months with liberal reporters who complained about his position on the issues, Justice Thomas told them, "Im here to stay. Deal with it!"
<P>Deal with it. The character of Justice Clarence Thomas has been horribly and ignobly assassinated by the establishment elite and yet this man lives.
<P>The action of the Prince Georges County, Maryland, school system proves one thing: there are two kinds of public officials: those who cower before the shrill of an elite few and those who act according to principle. Pity the students: the former have defrauded these children the right to hear the latter.<P>

"the Jury Did Not Believe the President"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>Last Week, President Clinton went into a tirade before the cameras, accusing Bob Dole of raising the character issue.  Over the weekend President Clinton was busy down-playing the active duty military defense his attorneys want to use against the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit.  Yesterday President Clinton went before the cameras to remind the voters that he was not on trial in Arkansas.  Bob Dole need not utter a word about it. With each action, President Clintons character is becoming his own third rail.
<P>Before convicting Susan McDougal, her former husband James McDougal and Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker, the jury in the Whitewater trial heard taped testimony from President Clinton.  It is extraordinary for a sitting president to testify in such a trial.  That testimony was critical to the defense.  The McDougals were former partners of Bill and Hillary Clinton.  At the very least, the presidents testimony ought to have led to the acquittal of Susan McDougal.  Instead the jury returned 24 guilty verdicts against the each of the defendants.  The president testified and yet the jury did not believe him.
<P>Were told jury members even prayed before reaching their decision. With yesterdays conviction, Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker  a Democrat  said he will resign by mid July.  In doing so, he chose not to try and run the state from the "big house" but instead to surrender his post to Lt. Governor Mike Huckabee  a Republican.  That conviction and subsequent resignation alone breaths new life into an issue which has dogged this Administration since the beginning.  After all, the president testified, and the jury did not believe him.
<P>Now the voters will see Whitewater as a warning to check the White House silverware.  Now the Congress will see Whitewater as a green light to pursue its own investigations with little risk of finger pointing over partisanship.  Now reporters will see Whitewater as an opportunity to compete for the Pulitzer prize.  But more than anything else, yesterdays Whitewater convictions give instant credibility to the efforts of special prosecutor Kenneth Starr. Why? Because the president testified and the jury did not believe him.
<P>Now Starr will be free turn his attention to the one most vulnerable figure in this case  first lady Hillary Clinton. Already a compelling question is being asked in the minds of those familiar with this case.  It is a question establishment players may find too indelicate to ask. So Ill ask it.  Did Hillary Clinton perjure herself?  Now, mind you, that is not a question for Bob Dole to ask.  Whitewater is not an issue to mingle with a presidential race designed to run on issues.  If Whitewater does prove the undoing of President Clinton, it will happen because of Bob Doles obvious silence than were he and his campaign to attempt to force the issue. Now Dole can boldly proclaim real issues without ever mentioning Whitewater. All because the president testified and the jury did not believe him.

"Clinton Should Stay Out of Foreign Elections"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<P>
By this time tomorrow we may know the projected winner in the Israeli elections. 
<P>By all measures, the contest will be determined by a razor-thin margin. The choice for Prime Minister is between the incumbent Shimon Peres and the challenger Benjamin Netanyahu. But in a sense, it is a contest between the old political order and a new order where the outcome depends largely on teenagers voting for the first time and refugees from the former Soviet Union who are also participating in their first Israeli election. 
<P>It has been an interesting roller coaster of an election. Netanyahu was chosen by the opposition Likud bloc last year and immediately began to challenge the so called peace process supported by the late Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin. Netanyahu jumped to a substantial lead in the polls and there was talk that Rabin was finished politically. Indeed the rally at which Rabin was shot was being held to drum up political support for the sagging fortunes of Rabin. 
<P>When Foreign Minister Shimon Peres took over from Rabin and the media tried to blame Netanyahu for creating the climate which led to Rabins death, Peres took what seemed to be an insurmountable lead in the polls. But Arab terrorist attacks and the ineffective Israeli response to them has permitted Netanyahu to climb back, inch by inch, to the point that he is now in a statistical dead heat with Peres and may even be slightly ahead with only 2% of the vote still undecided. 
<P>The outcome in this election will have an impact here in Washington. Throughout our history, we have always had our favorites in foreign elections. Hints were dropped here and there about what Washington thought and there were subtle moves to indicate our preference. But this time, President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, and other Administration officials have gone full tilt for Peres. At the moment polls showed the election tightening, Clinton called a hastily improvised summit meeting with Peres which was nothing more than a photo opportunity for the commercials which are now running on Israeli television. Of course promises of more foreign aid to Israel were suggested, IF Peres is re-elected. 
<P>The Clinton Administration in word and deed has left no stone unturned in its effort to influence the Israeli voters who know full well that there would be no Israel at all were it not for America. They also know how dependent Israel is on American economic aid so when "big brother" says he wants Peres, it is politically significant. But it may have backfired on Clinton and if so, the price to be paid will be high. 
<P>I had discussions with Netanyahu some years ago when he served in Washington. He is one tough customer. In fact, he may be the bluntest politician running for any office anywhere in the world. He would have no hesitancy in facing down Clinton and company the way he has faced down all of his domestic political enemies, which are many. 
<P>The Arabs, who have found common ground with Peres, would find that they had quite another kind of politician to deal with if Netanyahu wins. The Arabs who are eligible to vote in the Israeli elections are backing Peres nearly unanimously. 
<P>Directly interfering in a foreign election is not only a big gamble, it goes against the democratic principles we claim we espouse. This is an election for the citizens of Israel to decide, not for Washington to dictate.
<P>The United States is also intervening similarly in the Russian elections where we have done everything but carry the suitcases for Boris Yeltsin. Indeed our involvement has become one of the principal issues in the elections. Gregory Yavilinsky, who is the one candidate who comes closest to professing the democratic and free market ideals we claim to stand for, is outraged because until the United States and its Western partner intervened massively for Yeltsin, he was thought to have a shot at the election. That intervention, done at the taxpayers expense, may have propped up Yeltsin but it has also played right into the hand of the leading candidate, Gennady Zyuganov, whose main issue is that a plot on the part of the West caused the Soviet Union to collapse and thus it must be restored. 
<P>Bill Clinton has proved to be a masterful politician when it comes to handling the Republican Congress. With the media as his ally, he seems to be galloping to a second term and perhaps taking the Congress with him. His opponents claim he is guilty of deception and political manipulation. Be that as it may, Bill Clinton ought to stick to campaigning in this country. His overt intervention in foreign elections is dangerous either way those elections go. 
<P>Bill Clinton and company are big supporters of the New World Order so they see it as their duty to intervene. But the American taxpayers have no such obligation and through our elected officials in Congress we ought to demand that this worldwide manipulation of the democratic process be stopped before it drags us headlong into another world war.<P>

"God Is the Answer for the 21st Century"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>

<P>On this Memorial Day we remember those who have given their lives so that America may remain a free and independent nation. That question  whether we will remain a free and independent nation  as relevant at the close of what has been called the American Century as it was at the beginning of this Century. Only now the threat to Americas future is not coming from an ancient European order, nor Hitlers National Socialists, nor the evil empire of Communism. The external threat comes from Moslem fundamentalists who wish to destroy the concept of the nation state, the Chinese and Japanese military/commercial complex which seeks to overrun the rest of the world by economic invasion, as well as from the United Nations which seeks to destroy the concept of sovereignty.
<P>As we pray for those who have served their country well this past Century and before, let us call to mind those who assisted their country in unpopular causes. As painful as it was for the families whose loved ones were killed in the Great World Wars, they nevertheless had the esteem of the community because a member of their family was killed in pursuit of what was believed to be a great cause by the populace. 
<P>Pity those families who had loved ones killed in Vietnam, or who served America silently in the Cold War. There was little community comfort for those killed in the unpopular Vietnam war and as to the cold war, its many victims remain largely unknown because they served as silent agents of America in this undeclared conflict.
<P>And while we are at it, let us call to mind those who now serve their nation in unpopular locations from Bosnia to Macedonia to Haiti. Some will not return and because these conflicts lack popular support back home, the families involved will not enjoy the sort of support from mediating institutions which was forthcoming during the World Wars or even the Korean conflict. 
<P>This dark Century is ending with many of the names and locations with which the 20th Century began. We have by no means fought the wars which ended all wars. Indeed there are a record number of conflicts worldwide, many of them brutal civil wars where there seem to be no good guys or bad guys or even any rational cause at stake. 
<P>For the deaths of those Americans we commemorate on this day not to have been in vain, this nation must get back to the understanding that there will be no peace without a change in mens hearts, and there will be no change in mens hearts without God. As we head toward the 21st Century, mans synergistic co-operation with God will alone bring the tranquillity and order we all seek. If only God will grant our leaders the wisdom to understand that reality.<P>

"Why Clinton is Winning in the Polls"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>


<P>Remember those grade school stories of long ago about George Washington telling his father, "I cannot tell a lie. I chopped down the cherry tree," or Abraham Lincoln reading books by the light of the fire in his familys log cabin?
<P>Well if the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll is correct, you can forget all of that. 
<P>When asked if having someone of sound moral character was important in electing a President, only 22% of the respondents said yes. When asked if having a President who understood the problems of people like you was the most important factor in choosing a President, 77% responded in the affirmative.
<P>No wonder Bill Clinton is killing his rivals in the polls. In the same survey, 57% said he deserved another term in the White House. 
<P>The American people now want a President who feels their pain, not a President who has the strength of character to lead the nation. I guess that is why Bill Clinton will get by with asking that the Paula Jones lawsuit be delayed because he is Commander-in-Chief and thus is eligible to invoke a law passed at the time of World War II.  The law Bill Clinton is hiding behind was aimed at preventing a GI in a fox hole from being sued because he didnt send a payment for an appliance on time. 
<P>At a time when Admiral Boorda supposedly killed himself to avoid shame, Bill Clinton has no shame and the public thinks it is great. I guess if their President has no standards, they can excuse their own behavior somehow.  
<P>If moral character means next to nothing to Americans then no wonder Bill Clinton is Americas favorite. 
<P>Bill Clinton does tell people what they want to hear. He is for the gas tax repeal. He is for Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompsons welfare plan. He is for the bill to permit states to ban same sex marriages. He is for the balanced budget. He supports all the things the rest of us do. Never mind that his Administration has been in the opposite camp on all these issues. He passed the gas tax he now seeks to repeal. He vetoed the same sort of welfare reform Thompson has initiated. His administration has been in the forefront of supporting the homosexual agenda. He has vetoed the balanced budget. But reality doesnt matter. As long as Clinton says the right things, never mind what he does. 
<P>Yes, Bill Clinton is obviously the right man for these times. Times when apparently honesty and truth and integrity and morality take a distant second place to feeling good. One thing Bill Clinton can do better than anyone else, no matter how bad things really are, is make us feel good. Chelsea is such a lucky kid to have a father like Bill.
<P>

<h2>
"A Call for Impeachment of the Six Justices"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>In the history of nations, there comes a time when a crossroads is reached. Down one road is the slippery slope to perdition. It is the easier road, but at its end civilization lies in ruins and historians are left to chronicle the demise. Up the other road is the narrow, difficult path to the recovery of sovereignty of the people. The latter road is fraught with peril and many turn back along the way. But for those who make it, the possibility of passing on the heritage of the nation is made possible. 
<P>I believe we have reached such a crossroads with the Supreme Courts decision this week which struck down Amendment Two of the Colorado Constitution. This sweeping declaration by the Court is now being celebrated, if you will pardon the term, with gay abandon by those in the society who seek to undue all civilized restraints. It will take us down the road to the ultimate destruction of our society. 
<P>Again the Court has invented a new right under the Constitution which was never contemplated by the Founding Fathers. It was never given to the Court by any vote of the legislature or referendum of the people. The Supreme Court has now struck down, it would seem for all time, the one weapon citizens thought they had to preserve their society  the vote of the people.<P>
The issue was simple enough. The people of Colorado voted to instruct their own legislative bodies not to give special rights to homosexuals. No rights were taken away. Only rights not enjoyed by other groups in society were enjoined. <P>
The state of Colorado presented several arguments to meet the reasonableness test which the Court imposes in consideration of such issues. But six Supreme Court Justices rejected all those arguments and told the people of Colorado: You have lied to us. We here know that the reason you voted as you did is because you are bigoted against homosexuals. So we will thwart your will. We will void your sovereignty. We, the elite, will overturn your decision and we will open the door to anyone who feels he has been defeated by the democratic process to seek our protection from the people. <P>
The Justices said that the Colorado amendment "imposes a special disability upon (homosexual) persons alone. Homosexuals are forbidden the safeguards that others enjoy or may seek without constraint." But as an editorial in the Chicago Tribune suggests, "The inflated rhetoric masks analytical weakness. All the amendment says is that gays cant obtain civil rights protection without amending the state constitution, which they are free to attempt. They are at no more of a disadvantage than any other group adversely affected by their state constitution."<P>
This same Court, not a decade ago, said that it was constitutional to criminalize the behavior of homosexuals. They can be arrested and jailed for what they do, but the rest of us can be jailed for trying to prevent them from having special rights and protections not enjoyed by other groups of citizens. <P>
This is only the beginning, as various homosexual rights groups gleefully proclaim. This decision paves the way for the complete acceptance and sanction by this society of a lifestyle which is openly condemned in the Bible more times than any other specific sin. "An abomination unto the Lord" can now receive privileged treatment from legislative bodies. If this decision is allowed to stand, historians will look back upon this time as the critical turning point in our society. <P>
What is to be done? In the past I would have exhorted you to elect a President who would change the High Court by the appointment Justices who would adhere to the Constitution. That was the cry of Richard Nixon in the 1968 Presidential election. Nixon effected no such change. Nor, as it turned out, did Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George Bush, or, of course, Bill Clinton. Each of them contributed Justices who constituted the 6 to 3 majority of the Court on the Colorado decision.<P>
It is clear that no matter who we elect to the Congress and no matter what protective statutes they pass, this Court will declare them unconstitutional. The Marriage Protection Act is making its way through the Congress right now. By the standard of this Court, declaring that homosexuals cant marry constitutes bigotry. It is also clear that a vote of the people in the so-called sovereign states means nothing to this Court as it demonstrated in this case as well as in the recent case on term limits.<P>
There remains but one option for citizens who wish to protect themselves from the tyranny of the majority on this Supreme Court: impeachment.<P>
It is not a course I recommend lightly. In the early 1960s when the John Birch Society was pushing to impeach Earl Warren, I didnt buy into the idea even though I detested the decisions of the Warren court. There were many other remedies available, or so I thought, such as electing the right kind of President. In the mid 1960s when then Congressman Gerald Ford first raised the possibility of impeaching Justice William O. Douglas, I opposed the idea in a radio editorial even though I found Douglas and his views reprehensible. But this time it is different. We are out of remedies. Impeachment is our only hope of bringing a Court which is out of control, back under control. <P>
I would remind you that Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist paper number 81, wrote of the "important constitutional check which the power of instituting impeachment would give to (Congress) upon members of the judicial department."  Hamilton said, "This is alone a complete security. There can never be danger that the judges, by a series of deliberate usurpation on the authority of the legislature, would hazard the united resentment of the body entrusted with it."<P>
Indeed, the National Legal Foundation has compiled a history of impeachment which shows that in the early part of our nations history, the legislature was far more ready to act upon impeachment of judges, even a Justice of the Supreme Court, than we are today. That time was closer to the intent of our founding fathers. <P>
To the argument that impeachment can only be initiated for matters such as embezzlement or bribery, let me cite what then Minority Leader Gerald Ford said in 1970 during his drive to impeach Justice Douglas:  "What, then, is an impeachable offense? The only honest answer is that an impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history; conviction results from whatever offense or offenses two thirds of the other body considers to be sufficiently serious to require removal of the accused from office." As Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote in his opinion in Rochin vs. California, justices who do not restrain themselves are subject to only two remedies. A constitutional amendment or impeachment. <P>
I understand the implications of what I am recommending. I have no illusions that the Senate would remove these Justices from office. But the mere act of initiating impeachment would finally focus the attention of this nation on the enormity of the crimes which this Court has committed against our constitutional form of government.<P>
Rather than stand aside and watch this nation slide further down the path to ultimate destruction, I hope and I pray that citizens will petition their Representatives to impeach the majority of this court and in doing so, will employ the one remaining remedy they have to save the nation. Thats all for Direct Line for tonight. <P>

"Doles Bold Move"
</h2>
</center>

<P>


<P>
<P>
<P>
"Doles Bold Move"
<P>
I thought I would wait until the dust settled a bit before commenting on Senate Majority Leader Bob Doles gamble to resign and run without office for the Presidency. That I was surprised by this development is an understatement. That Sheila Burke was not one of the five people in the world who knew several weeks ahead of time that Dole was going to do this, is the best element of all. It demonstrated that at last Dole had shed his emotional dependence on Burke, which is a positive development. <P>
Dole demonstrated that it is possible to teach an old political dog new tricks. Most of us who thought we knew him well did not believe he had it in him to pull this off. After all, even if he lost the Presidency, Dole still would have been the Republican Leader. Although there was brave talk about running someone against him, when it came to the moment of truth, he probably would have remained Republican Leader for another two years. <P>
The Dole move probably means that Senate Majority Whip Trent Lott becomes Majority Leader. He will likely prove to be a far more energetic and able Leader than Dole and that has boosted the morale of the Republican Senators. So giving all of this up to go after the big prize indeed was a stunning development, at least in Washington. In the rest of the nation, it was not greeted as such a remarkable event because the rest of the nation is sensibly not as caught up in politics as Washington. <P>
The Dole move did have an effect on his campaign. It gave his troops new hope that he could win, which is something he badly needed to do. It afforded him a new opportunity to redefine himself. Up to now, to the extent that anyone knew anything about Bob Dole, it was that he was the consummate Washington Insider, not exactly a compliment these days. The Dole move represents a break with the past, even though stunned Democrats bitterly complain that Dole cant shed 36 years of Congressional service just like that. <P>
Now comes the hard part. Without the advantages that being Senate Majority Leader gave him to generate headlines, Dole must distinguish himself boldly from President Bill Clinton. Can Dole, who supports Clinton on Bosnia and China really distinguish himself from Clinton on foreign policy? Can Dole, who is no stranger to tax increases, really be credible in calling for a tax rate reduction? Can Dole, who voted for almost all of Bill Clintons judicial appointments, really come down hard on the sort of judges Bill Clinton has appointed? <P>
The Dole camp has maintained that this election would be about character and integrity. Unfortunately for Dole, all of the latest polls show that the public, by a large margin, actually believes Bill Clinton is more honest and has greater integrity than Bob Dole. That is probably the most remarkable development of this campaign. If someone like Bill Clinton, who has made a career out of dissembling, can sell honesty and integrity to the American public, Bob Dole had better hope that he can distinguish himself from Clinton on issues.<P>
Clinton is not helping Dole in any way. Dole was about to deliver a speech on welfare reform and the Clinton folks heard about it. Clinton rushed to embrace the welfare reform model proposed by Wisconsin Republican Governor Tommy Thompson. Republican Governors were outraged, but Bill Clinton got on the scoreboard first. <P>
A  Washington Times cartoon showed Clinton in the form of a parrot in a cage next to a radio. On the radio was news of Doles impending speech on welfare reform. The Clinton-like parrot squawked "Welfare reform. Bawk. Welfare reform." That is about the size of it but Clinton has done it well. <P>
The truth is that the Republican Congress sent the President two versions of welfare reform, both of which he had praised at one point. Clinton vetoed both. <P>
Therein lies the one hook that Dole has on Clinton and one which could prove to be decisive in this campaign. The President says one thing and does the opposite. Voters may think they trust Bill Clinton right now. They may think he agrees with them on the issues. But if Dole can pound home the truth that Bill Clinton is, in a sea of Washington hypocrisy, the biggest fish of them all, then Dole may actually have an effective weapon against the President. <P>
Voters, at the end of the day, dislike hypocrisy more than anything else. It remains to be seen if Dole can be bold enough, after this very bold restart to his campaign, to carry that issue to the finish line. <P>

"Preempting the FDA Power Grab"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>


<P>
<P>

<P>
I am not a chess player but it seems to me that Philip Morris has dealt a rather decisive blow to the plan of food and drug czar David Kessler to assert jurisdiction over the tobacco industry. <P>
Philip Morris has announced that it will seek federal legislation to make it a crime to sell tobacco to kids under age 18. Vending machines would be banished. Sale of single cigarettes would also be forbidden. Sampling would not be permitted except in areas where minors are denied access. Retailers would have to certify that they and their employees will enforce the law. <P>
The plan would also ban tobacco products from T-shirts and hats. There would be tobacco free zones where advertising tobacco products would not be permitted. No advertising would be allowed in any transit vehicle or in terminals. Tobacco products could not sponsor any sporting event where there is a significant youthful audience. <P>
Philip Morris Vice President Steve Parrish challenged President Clinton to support this legislation and to drop what Parrish calls the unconstitutional efforts of the FDA to assert jurisdiction over tobacco products. The President can avoid years of costly litigation, Parrish said, by getting on board this legislation and getting the FDA to drop its rule making procedure. Now, clearly, we will see if President Clinton wants to do something about the problem of teenage smoking or if he just wants to expand the power of one of his favorite government agencies. <P>
As commendable as the Philip Morris initiative is, still it federalizes a matter which ought to be left up to the states. But even if the states were to adopt all of the suggestions of the Institute of Medicine, whose recommendations Philip Morris followed in coming up with their legislation, there is still no substitute for parental guidance and parental example. <P>
If adults are really concerned about teenage smoking, they ought to take it seriously when they learn that their children are smoking. They ought to stop smoking themselves. Laws, especially federal laws, are no substitute for parental responsibility. <P>
While we would rather see Congress pass a law than a federal agency seize power in an unconstitutional fashion, members of society should turn less to federal laws and more to themselves if societal problems are going to be solved. <P>

"New Spin on Natural Laws"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<center>
by Mark Weaver
</center>

<P>
The past hours discussion of the issue of gay marriage may make you wonder where our culture is heading.  What wont people do for a thrill?  What natural laws wont they flout?  Well, wait till you hear this!
<P>Frightful new attractions are popping up across the country this summer, luring children and flouting the law of ...GRAVITY.  
<P>A new roller coaster opening June 1st at Six Flags Magic Mountain is designed to break the 100 mile-an-hour barrier for the first time. The ride, called Superman the Escape, propels you from a standstill to 100 mile-an-hour in seven seconds up a four-hundred-foot tower, where you float in zero gravity until you drop backward.    Thats also at one-hundred miles an hour.  You are weightless for about 6 seconds, another record.
<P>But thats not all.  Competition is pushing designers to make rides faster and higher.
<P>Paul Ruben of the trade magazine Park World says "Were in the roller coaster arms race."   He should know.  His job has involved riding 400 roller coasters.  He says "Ive seen this occurring for 20 years or more. Every park likes to have bragging rights to the fastest, wildest ride for at least one year."
<P>Las Vegas makes its bid with two rides called The Big Shot and The High Roller, both on top of a new one-thousand foot tower. The High Roller tools around a track near the top. The Big Shot shoots you up toward the top then drops you back.  Said one man,    "This is the most exciting thing Ive ever done next to jumping out of an airplane," (which I wouldnt do either.)
<P>Superman and Big Shot use "Star Wars" technology - electromagnetic motors developed for the military.  The motorswhite boxes along the trackspull magnets on the cars, shooting you faster as you cross each one.    Scientists experimented with them to shoot satellites into orbit on tracks. On Superman, YOU are the payload.
<P>Electromagnetic propulsion has already replaced chains and motors on rides in Mexico City, Kentucky and Wisconsin. Other such rides are opening at Worlds of Fun in Kansas City, Mo.; Universal Studios Florida; and Dreamland, near Sydney, Australia.  
<P>Promoters in the amusement business have been bragging about hundred mile-an-hour roller coasters since the 1920s. But that was before radar guns and truth-in-advertising laws.    Actually, 82 mph is the record right now, claimed jointly by Desperado at Buffalo Bills Casino in Stateline, Nev., and the Steel Phantom in Kennywood, outside Pittsburgh.    
<P>Whats it going to be like to ride Superman the Escape?  Rumor has it that Paul Weyrich is going to be the FIRST rider, and hell give you a full report.<P>

"We Are Winning"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P><center>
by Rep. Mark Neumann (R-WI)
</center>
<P>
<P>In 1995, I came to Congress along with 72 other newly elected freshman Members.  
<P>Before any of us even took our oath of office, we resolved ourselves to achieving a very specific goal  to reduce the federal deficit, to balance our budget and to eliminate wasteful Washington spending.  	
<P>Now, just 16 months later, I have good news to report: we are winning this battle!
<P>It hasnt been easy, I can assure you of that.  But the results we have achieved, are well worth the effort.
<P>Let me show you the financial picture of our nation, when I came here, and where we stand now. 
<P>When we arrived here a year ago, this is what we found:  The red line on this chart illustrates the problem of the federal deficit.  It was at about $200 billion per year and growing indefinitely.
<P>If we had allowed this trend to continue, our country would sink further and further into debt, creating a disastrous future for our children and grandchildren.  But we did not allow that to happen.  We took action.
<P>First, we passed a recessions bill.  That means that right off the bat, we took $11 billion of wasteful spending out of the budget.
<P>Then the appropriators went to work.  John Kasich, the chairman of the Budget Committee, set a goal and said $23 billion of wasteful spending had to be eliminated. "Come in $23 billion under the previous year, or our plan to balance the budget wont work," Kasich told them.
<P>Folks, this is the first time in a generation this has been done. 
<P>By December, this is where we were.  We were making progress, but still, we dared to dream.  We dared to dream that we could restore a better future for this Nation.  We dared to dream that we could get our country back on track.
<P>If you look at this chart, you see that this green line is the path to a balanced budget, and the road to a secure financial future for our children and grandchildren.
<P>So we set a deficit target for fiscal year 1996.  That target was $157 billion.  So what happened?  The financial markets looked at this and they reacted positively, and exactly as predicted.
<P>The most positive and helpful sign for the American people was that interest rates stayed down.  And when that happened, more people  especially younger folks  could afford to buy houses and cars.
<P>This created jobs and job opportunities for our young people because somebody has to build those houses and cars.
<P>Folks, this is exactly how America is supposed to work.
<P>What followed next was our unemployment rate went down, as did the welfare rolls and interest cost to the government.
<P>But that was not the end of the story.  When the markets reacted in a positive way, and the appropriators fulfilled their commitment to our Nation, not only did we hit our target for a balanced budget, we came in $8 billion less than where we needed to be in order to reach a balanced budget in 2002.
<P>That is the story behind the story. We are $8 billion ahead of where we need to be in order to reach a balanced budget by the year 2002!
<P>This is great news, and Im happy to deliver it to you, because its not often that you hear good news out of Washington.
<P>And theres even more good news.  Were on track to balancing the budget without raising your taxes.  We did not go back to the 1993 way of raising your taxes.  Weve accomplished this by truly shrinking parts of this government.
<P>This Congress has kept its commitment to balancing the budget.  In the past, other Congresses have spent money hand over fist thinking that was the way to win over the voters.
<P>But this Congress understands that the best thing we can do right now for the American worker, and for our children and our grandchildren is to balance the budget.
<P>A balanced federal budget is a permanent solution to our Nations economic problems.  Never again should we give in to quick-fix gimmicks, election year charades, and snake-oil solutions.<P>
What does a balanced federal budget mean to you and your family?  It means:<P>
<ul><li>lower interest rates which makes it easier to buy houses, cars and other goods;
<LI>it means lower taxes;
<li>it means more jobs, lower unemployment, and fewer people on the welfare rolls;
<li>and finally it means higher salaries and more take-home pay to spend as you see fit.
</ul>Folks, we are winning! Is there more to be done?  Sure there is.<P>
But with your help, we can cut through the demagoguery of the other side and keep our focus on balancing the budget.  When we do that, we will return economic security to you, and a brighter financial future to your children.<P>

"A New Scenario for Dole"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>
"A New Scenario for Dole"
<P>
Right now things are pretty grim in the Dole camp. As former Vice President Dan Quayle suggested yesterday, things will probably get worse before they get better because Dole is out of money. Moreover, because Bill Clinton was unchallenged in the primaries, he has millions to spend. Dole, on the other hand, remains mired in the muck of Senate procedures where the likes of Ted Kennedy can get the best of him.<P>
There is an alternative scenario kicking around which, if Dole can pull it off, would transform his campaign overnight. You will recall that the Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment failed by a single vote in the U.S. Senate last year. It received the two-thirds majority needed in the House with votes to spare. But six Democrats who had previously voted for such an amendment suddenly switched positions and the Amendment went down to defeat. When that happened the whole push for the "Contract With America" went into the tank.<P>
The reason that some of the Democrats claimed they switched was articulated by Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota in two words: Social Security. Because the so called Social Security Trust Fund is considered on budget, the surpluses it presently produces are used to offset other government spending. Dorgan insisted that this does not offer enough protection for Social Security. In fact, Dorgan came off as some sort of hero in North Dakota because voters believed he had helped to save Social Security.<P>
Well, Republicans ought to just accept that argument. Taking Social Security off budget would mean that to achieve a balanced budget another $35 billion per year would have to be cut from domestic spending. Sounds good to me. Maybe we finally could eliminate the Legal Services Corporation, the National Endowment for the Arts, Goals 2000, Americorps, and other such programs which produce more harm than good.<P>
Right now, quietly behind the scenes, Dole and Illinois Democratic Senator Paul Simon, who fervently believes in a balanced budget and who would like to cap his Senate career by seeing such an amendment passed, are trying to see if the votes are there to pass a new version of the Amendment which takes Social Security off budget.<P>
It is hard to believe that Democrats would provide Dole with such an opportunity. However, the two North Dakota Senators, especially, were so high profile in their contention that they really did favor a balanced budget. If the Amendment got Social Security off the books, it may be hard for them to back away from the issue now.<P>
This new version of the Balanced Budget Amendment should be able to easily pass the House. And guess what? A Constitutional Amendment does not go to Bill Clinton for his signature. It goes directly to the states for ratification.<P>
Picture this:  there are now 31 Republican Governors and half of the state legislative houses are controlled by the Republicans. Imagine that Presidential candidate Bob Dole, now lacking money to run a regular campaign, would go from state to state urging the legislatures to ratify the Balanced Budget Amendment. It would highlight the fact that he was able to get such an amendment through the Congress; it would give the Republican Governors and legislatures a chance to showcase positive changes they are making in state government; and Dole addressing state legislatures would probably get live coverage in most of the states where it would take place.<P>
The Dole campaign, which is on the rocks in every way right now, could be transformed overnight into a positive force for an initiative which is supported overwhelmingly by the American people. There is little that Bill Clinton could do about it. Clinton opposed the Constitutional Amendment for a Balanced Budget when it was before the Congress. His liberal allies know that if such an amendment is in place, federal funding for many of their favorite programs becomes dubious at best.<P>
This scenario is probably too good to be true. My guess is that if Dole and Simon do come up with a Balanced Budget Amendment that satisfies the two Senators from North Dakota, a couple of other Democrats who had previously voted for the Amendment will switch to be against it on the grounds that removing Social Security from the budget will require cutting too much from domestic spending.<P>
As Peter Ferrara suggests in a column in today's Washington Times, Dole should then be commended for trying. In the off chance Dole would be able to make it happen, all bets would be off on the Presidential race. The chance to hammer home the fact that Dole favors a Balanced Budget Amendment and Bill Clinton does not, and make that case before state legislatures in very real and graphic terms, live and in person, would turn around the dour prospects for a Dole presidency.<P>

"Sacrificing Principle for Party Loyalty"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>
How do I hate this town? Let me count the ways! For one thing, almost no one really puts himself on the line for what he says he believes in.<P>
Case in point. Majority Leader Dick Armey wears his conservatism on his sleeve. To hear him talk, you would think he is one of the most principled of men ever to grace the Leadership of either party. I am sure he thinks of himself as principled. But Dick Armey is a party man first and foremost. And as a party man he puts protecting incumbents ahead of principle.<P>
Congresswoman Sue Kelly is one such incumbent. She voted against many items in the "Contract with America." When the Leadership said last summer that the Labor HHS Appropriations Bill was Armageddon and twisted arms until they hurt with GOP members who were reluctant to vote for the bill, Sue Kelly defied the Leadership. Worst of all, Sue Kelly was one of five Republicans to vote with President Clinton against the partial birth abortion bill.<P>
Sue Kellys opponent in the GOP primary is former Congressman Joe DioGuardi. DioGuardi is famous for having been the candidate who retired Bella Abzug from the House of Representatives. DioGuardi, when he served in the House, was the only certified public accountant to ever to do so. It is DioGuardi who pointed to the irregularities of the House majority which Speaker Gingrich was pleased to pick up on when he took over a year and a half ago.<P>
DioGuardi would be a loyal soldier when it came to things such as the "Contract." He would never vote against the Leadership on a key appropriations bill. In New Yorks multi-party system, DioGuardi already has the Right to Life party line. He would not be a dissenter on an issue like partial birth abortions. Yet Dick Armey, to help protect Sue Kelly, has gone so far as to call potential DioGuardi contributors in New York to ask them not to give to the DioGuardi campaign. Other members of the Leadership have tried to make the case for Kelly as well on the grounds that the GOP will lose the seat if she is not the nominee.<P>
First of all, if DioGuardi wins the GOP nomination and already has the Conservative and Right to Life party nominations, he will have an excellent chance of getting elected. But even if Kelly had the better chance of holding the seat, is incumbent loyalty worth sacrificing ones principles? Is it worth helping someone who is so liberal that even partial birth abortion doesnt stir her conscience? Is incumbent loyalty worth stabbing a fine upstanding man like DioGuardi in the back?<P>
Take the case of Congressman Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania. Speaker Gingrich gives passionate speeches about how the labor unions are out to destroy his Republican majority. Indeed they are and first among them is the National Education Association, the teachers union. When push comes to shove, Congressman Goodling, a former teacher, does the NEAs biding inside the GOP caucus.<P>
Goodling, who was first elected to replace his father George Goodling in 1974, was challenged in the Republican primary by civic activist Charlie Gerow. Gerow ran because he wanted to join the likes of the eager young freshmen who have made such a difference in Congress. Goodlings cozy relationship with the NEA was one of the key issues in the campaign. Well, who made an all-embracing appearance in the district for Bill Goodling at the strategic moment when it was clear it was a horse race? Why Speaker Gingrich, of course. <P>
When the results were in, Goodling was only re-nominated with a 53% to 47% vote. Gerow contends that if Gingrich had just stayed out, he would have defeated Goodling in this heavily Republican district. Then the NEA would not have had a mole inside the GOP ranks. But incumbent loyalty is more important to the Leadership than principle, when principle means standing up for those who believe the same things that the Leadership professes to believe.<P>
Perhaps one can morally justify neutrality on the part of the Leadership in such cases.  After all, members of the Leadership are put in a difficult position when one of their members is challenged in a primary. But all out support for incumbent members who are challenged by candidates of principle is next to impossible to justify if you really believe in the causes you preach to the faithful on a daily basis. No wonder the American electorate has grown increasingly cynical.<P>
Contrast this incumbent loyalty among Republicans with the Democrats. Congressman Ralph Hall of Texas is perhaps the most conservative Democrat in Congress. His voting record is better than that of most Republicans. A couple of times since he was first elected in 1980, Hall was perceived to be in trouble. He might have been replaced with a Republican. The Democratic Leadership was nowhere to be found. Hall was on his own. That is because Hall routinely votes with the Republicans on issues and defies the Democratic Leadership even on crucial votes. Their loyalty to liberalism was greater than their loyalty to one of their incumbents who votes against them. Even though Hall is a close friend of mine and I am glad he survived those challenges, I have to admire the liberals for at least standing for something.<P>
One possible Republican exception to this sorry state of affairs is Oklahomas freshman Representative Steve Largent. Late last year Speaker Gingrich sought to punish a group of conservatives because they didnt cave in when he did on shutting down the government. Largent then stepped in and did the fund-raisers for those on whom Gingrich canceled out. It worked out well. The public would rather pay to see a star athlete like Largent any day over a Washington politician.<P>
What Largent did took real fortitude. But of course he is a freshman. Were he serving his ninth term like Gingrich or his sixth term like Armey, he might not be as eager to cross a member of the Leadership.<P>
There is a reason that many of us who used to be adamantly opposed to term limits are now among its most ardent backers. The longer I stay here and see good men like DioGuardi and Gerow stabbed in the back by supposed philosophical standard bearers such as Gingrich and Armey, the more passionate about term limits I become.<P>

"Making a Tax Cut Better"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
Last week, Wednesday, I was witness to a dialogue between a freshman Senator and a freshman Congressman. That conversation got to the essence of where this nation is going in fiscal terms.<P>
The Senator was John Ashcroft, the former Governor of Missouri. He was explaining his proposal to make social security taxes deductible. Such a tax cut would mean an average middle class family would save more than $1700 a year in federal taxes. The Ashcroft program would cost $35 billion for its first year and more than $50 billion each year thereafter.<P>
The Congressman was Wisconsins Mark Neumann, the single most focused Member of the House on the question of our national debt.<P>
Neumann asked how the Senator was going to "pay for this legislation in terms of spending cuts."  The Senator from Missouri was vague.  "Well cut some money from corporate welfare and well get some money through welfare reform and from overhead expenses from the federal government," Ashcroft told the Congressman.<P>
"No, I mean specifically," Neumann replied. "What exactly would you cut and how much?"<P>
The Senator didnt know. Neumann continued, "Look, I like tax cuts. I want to vote for this legislation. But I cant vote for anything which will enlarge the deficit. Unless you know exactly what you are going to cut and from where youre going to cut it, the bill will end up enlarging the deficit."<P>
The Senator was silent. Neumann was exactly right. <P>
I think the Ashcroft idea is a splendid one. It would provide a middle class tax cut in exactly the way it should be provided. I hope his bill gains traction. But the day has passed when any responsible legislator should propose any piece of legislation without giving specific consideration to what will be cut from federal spending if the legislation is passed. <P>
With trillions of dollars in off book debt and unfunded liabilities, not to mention the current budget deficit, we simply cannot afford to pass legislation without looking at the precise consequences of enacting such bills. We have been avoiding such consequences for the past several decades. Look where it has brought us.<P>
The correct answer to all this is that we should do both. We ought to pass Ashcrofts bill, but Ashcroft should spell out precisely what portions of the federal budget he will cut out in order to make up for the lost revenue his bill would engender. Then we will have the best of both worlds. We will be giving a tax cut to the people who need it most, in the most equitable method possible. At the same time we will further cut federal spending in other areas so as not to enlarge the debt. All responsible legislators need to ask the questions Mark Neumann asked. Then we will truly be making progress. <P>

"Supporting Tyranny over Freedom"
</h2>
(Delivered by Brad Keena)
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>
A 58-year-old, highly educated, and soft spoken freedom fighter is, as we speak, 
conducting a hunger strike in a Belarus jail. He is the victim of a Stalinist style 
crackdown which is taking place in the former Soviet Republic. 
<p>Yuri Khadykas crime is that he dared to speak out against the repressive and dictatorial 
regime of hard line Communist Alexandr Lukashenko. Lukashenko is trying to 
reintegrate his country with Russia without a vote of the people giving him authority to 
do so. Lukashenko admires Adolph Hitler and yearns for the return of a true Russian 
leader like Josef Stalin so that at least real order can be restored. 
<p>Among all of the former Soviet Republics, Belarus has made the least progress in moving 
toward democracy and free enterprise. Even in places such as Georgia, Armenia, and the 
Central Asian Republics things are better off than in Belarus. Lukashenko has suspended 
the parliament, even though his fellow Communists have a lopsided majority there. He 
does not want to give a forum to the few Democratic voices who serve in that body and 
that is where Yuri Khadyka comes in. 
<p>Freedom fighters are given no access to the media. Their voices in elected government 
have been silenced. The only alternative for them now is to take to the streets. But for 
doing so, Khadyka and a couple hundred organizers of a 30,000 person demonstration in 
downtown Minsk were arrested on April 26th. 
<p>Khadyka has not been allowed to talk to his lawyer. He may languish in jail for up to six 
months before there is any trial, if there is one. And in Lukashenkos Belarus, the 
outcome of the trial will be a forgone conclusion, just as the trials of dissidents were 
foreordained in the former Soviet Union. 
<p>What is happening in Belarus is symbolic of what is happening in other places in the 
East. It is the prototype for what will take place if Communist candidate Gannady 
Zuganov is elected President in the upcoming elections. He has promised a similar 
crackdown on those regarded as opponents of the Communist ideology.
<p>To us, Khadyka is not just some remote figure we hear about in short- wave radio 
coverage of foreign developments. He is someone we know well. Bob Krieble and I have 
had lengthy discussions with him on several occasions. His son, 29-year-old Alexey, has 
worked for us at the Krieble Institute of the Free Congress Foundation for the past four 
years. He is one of the young, dedicated freedom fighters who have risked their lives to 
help promote freedom and democracy in the former Soviet empire. 
<p>Last Saturday night I was awakened in the middle of the night with news of the ominous 
developments in Belarus. Alexey pleaded for our help to get word of the plight of the 
Belarus freedom fighters to American officials. Well, our discussions with the State 
Department were exactly what you would expect. This Administration, while willing to 
involve itself in imposing a leftist government in Haiti, is unwilling to lift a finger to 
protest repression in Belarus. 
<p>The realities of the repression there do not square with this nations policy of the 
reconstruction of the former Soviet Union. Yes, the State Department wants to see the 
former Soviet Union re-established in some new form. Our officials think that will bring 
stability to the region. Yes, it will bring stability the stability of the graveyard. 
<p>While most of the other organizers who have been arrested in Belarus have now been 
released from jail, Khadyka remains there. He is a special problem case because he is also 
a Christian leader who has sought the return of the ancient Bylorussian language as well. 
Someone with his views is not convenient for the Lukashenko regime. 
<p>We have managed to interest some Members of Congress in what is happening in 
Belarus. Robert Novak devoted todays syndicated column to this subject. Perhaps little 
by little we will bring world attention to the plight of freedom loving people in this small 
former Soviet Republic of l2 million people. 
<p>The issue here isnt that Yuri Khadyka is a truly fine man, which he is. The issue here 
that the United States government is cooperating with pro-Communist forces in the 
reconstruction of the Evil Empire. That is not why our men and women died on the 
battlefield opposing tyranny in this long and bloody twentieth Century. This is not why 
countless more unsung heroes died during the Cold War.
<p>The time to speak up against this evil is now before it is too late. Failure to do so may 
well mean that the next Century will bring confrontation with a new evil empire all over 
again. Only this time, the outcome might not be the same.

"Washingtons Misplaced Perspective"
</h2>
(Delivered by Brad Keena)
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>
	There is old adage that says "politics is like sausage  you don't want to know how it is made!"
	Considering this is an election year, each passing day is proving those words were inspired to describe Washington and its establishment.  Washington today is like a great big sausage factory.  Broadcasting here so close to the factory, we sense it all around us.  Even now, as I listen carefully, I can hear the haunting screams of ordinary citizens falling into giant tax machines ripping out their wallets; tossing what remains in huge grinders designed to pulverize faith and morality through the terrible engines of an unstoppable federal judiciary.  In the air this election year is the malodorous waft of this huge sausage factory we call Washington.  The mixture created in this factory is ghastly to look at until the Administration adds its coloring to give the final grind an appearance of being edible.
<P>	Like short-order cooks, the establishment media fries up this nasty glop into bite size bits, served on plates with ugly china patterns with names like HUD, Education, Commerce, and Labor.
The table is set before the hungry establishment elite competing in a sausage-eating contest  a game which will last until November.  No one at the table is willing to admit where the sausage came from, how it is made, or what's in it.  To admit this would cause each at the table to lose his or her appetite:  for the sausage has come from outside of Washington.  It has been scandalously and horribly made with the most vile additives.  Its ingredients include the faith and hopes and dreams of ordinary Americans.  Together the future of each has been reprocessed into morsels prepared for the gluttonous elite seated at Washington's table.
<P>	The machine grinds on.  The terrible sounds continue night and day.  The stench of this factory permeates the air.  Unending is the Establishment's voracious appetite for power over its citizenry.
Perspective is a remarkable thing.  As humans, we tend to get lost in the false perspective of seeming permanence.  Time is slow moving.  Often we think what we see at the moment is permanent, but we're wrong.  America did not always look this way.  We have allowed our own government to remove itself from morality's scale.  The courts have overruled God's moral measurements, the government has thrown aside God's ethical scales.  The true measurement is sure.  It's weight is exact.  It's precision remains for all time.  Yet our culture has chosen a perspective which avoids to close a look at the moral and ethical realities.  Don't ask, don't tell about homosexuality in the military; don't ask, don't tell about the murder of babies even moments before birth; don't ask, don't tell about a political process promising to deliver everything we want at the expense of everything we've got.
<P>	This is not America.  This is another nation.  It's capital has become the sausage factory.  
In the banquet hall, its king and his lords, his wives and his concubines are drinking the blood of society in silver vessels, praising the gods of the Establishment.  On one wall of Washington's terrible banquet hall is a great hand.  It is writing Washington's future, telling the measurement and weight of the moral scales society had allowed Washington to disregard.  The writing on this wall is becoming visible for all to see:  "Moral integrity has been found wanting. Days are numbered. The kingdom is about to become divided."
<P>	Meanwhile, the banquet continues.  The writing on the wall has gone yet unnoticed.  The Washington sausage factory drones on.<P>

"FDA Commissioners Arrogance"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>


<P>
I have spoken before of the arrogance of the federal Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, in its constant effort to seize more power for itself. Further evidence of that arrogance just keeps on building. <P>
The Washington Legal Foundation has filed a First Amendment lawsuit against the FDA, challenging the agencys crackdown on the dissemination of information regarding the "off label" uses of FDA approved drugs and medical devices. The Washington Legal Foundation lawsuit contends that the FDAs restrictions violate the First Amendment rights of both the providers and the recipients of such information. <P>
Federal law currently prohibits the manufacturer of an FDA approved drug or device from specifying on the product label any uses of the product other than the precise use approved by the FDA. However, doctors are free to prescribe FDA approved products for uses other than those specified by the product label. In fact, in many areas of medicine, most of the treatment recognized by the medical community consists of off label uses of FDA approved products. <P>
Recently the FDA has begun a crackdown on manufacturers who become involved, in any way, in the dissemination of information about the off label uses of their own products, such as distributing to doctors medical text books which contain information about the off label drug uses. The Washington Legal Foundation suit contends that this is a violation of the First Amendment which effects not only the producer of the product but also the recipients, first the doctor and ultimately the patient. <P>
Commissioner David Kessler of the FDA refused to appear at a scheduled deposition on April 24th. The legal foundation is trying to depose Kessler in order to, in its words, "establish that he was personally responsible for the FDA crackdown and that in directing the FDA to implement its no policy, he gave no thought to whether the crackdown might violate free speech rights." Washington Legal Foundations lawyers claim that senior FDA officials deposed to date in the lawsuit have admitted that First Amendment concerns played no role in their policy deliberations. The foundation contends that it needs to depose Kessler as well to establish that he too was oblivious to First Amendment rights in formulating agency policy.<P>
Well, Kessler was a no-show. Instead he filed a motion to quash the deposition which Federal Judge Royce Lamberth will rule on shortly. Such a move on Kesslers part is unprecedented. "It is outrageous that Commissioner Kessler thinks he is above the law and not subject to the same litigation rules as anyone else who gets involved in a lawsuit," said the Foundations Chief Legal Counsel Richard Samp. Samp pointed out that even Bill Clinton has had to give a deposition in connection with Whitewater and the First Lady has had to appear before a grand jury in connection with the White House travel office. <P>
Samp contends that Kessler said one of his top priorities as Commissioner would be to crackdown on the off label uses of FDA approved products. Never mind that people are being cured by these products. Never mind that such products are recognized as the only possible remedy in some medical cases. What the FDA seeks is total control. <P>
That attitude was reflected in a very personal letter former Congresswoman Marilyn Lloyd  sent to some Members of the House. The Congresswoman from Tennessee served in the House for 20 years before retiring after the 1994 elections. Marilyn Lloyd told her former colleagues that she had undergone a mastectomy in 1991 and had chosen silicone breast implant surgery. But just before her surgery was to take place the FDA ruled that such operations could not go forward. <P>
Mrs. Lloyd contends that the FDA made this ruling with no scientific evidence that such implants were harmful. She quotes Dr. John E. Woods, vice chairman of the Department of Surgery at the Mayo Clinic as saying, "Instead of protecting the health and concerns of women, this moratorium caused undue stress and anxiety for women with implants and women who wanted them around the world." Mrs. Lloyd told the Members of Congress to whom she wrote, "I want you to understand that the irresponsible nature of the FDAs decision has led to real women  mothers, wives and daughters  dying needlessly." <P>
Again the issue here is one of control. That is what David Kessler and his agents are all about. Control over other peoples lives. <P>
There is more and more evidence that the FDA is a government agency totally out of control. This Congress owes it to the long-suffering American public to take the steps necessary to tie Commissioner Kesslers hands.  Congress must do this before more innocent people die needlessly because they are unsuspectingly caught up in one of Kesslers little power games. <P>

"House Speaker Cultivating Challengers"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>


<P>
These are not the best of times for Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. First, he was savagely attacked by New York Senator Al D'Amato who claimed that Gingrich had misread the 1994 elections and thus had proposed radical initiatives instead of the incremental changes the voters wanted. Now comes word from inside the House that some Members are talking seriously about challenging Gingrich for the Speaker's post in the next Congress.<P>
The challenge comes not from the dozen or so hard-core conservatives among the freshmen who have never cared much for the Speaker. Rather, the challenge comes from an outer core of less-adamant conservatives. One multi-term Member told me he knew of at least two candidates who were considering the run. All of the current members of the leadership strongly back Gingrich and are opposed to any run against him.<P>
This whole issue is relevant only if Republicans keep control of the Congress, because in the event they become a minority, the Republicans will lose one leadership position and Gingrich has already said publicly that he would drop out in such a case.<P>
The rap against the Speaker from those who want an alternative is two-fold. First, his opponents claim, he plays games on crucial issues. There is now a dispute, for example, between the Speaker and Majority Leader Dick Armey over the minimum wage issue. Armey says he doesn't want to vote on the issue at all because the minimum wage is part of the Democratic agenda. Gingrich points to a letter he received from 38 "moderate" Republican Members of the House who back the Minimum wage.  He says a vote on the issue is inevitable and so he wants it brought to the floor with Republican provisions attached. <P>Conservative opponents of Gingrich claim that he actually encouraged the "moderates" to write the letter to him in the first place. They quote one of their colleagues as telling them "I didn't want to sign the letter (on the minimum wage) but Newt asked me to." Their claim is that this is all too typical of how Gingrich operates, pitting one side against another. Moreover they contend that when liberal Republicans bolt the party line, nothing is said to them at all. But when conservatives disagree with Gingrich they are taken to the woodshed, cursed at, and told to get in the real world.<P>
The second rap against Gingrich is that he is often unfocused and flits from issue to issue. The Gingrich opponents claim that the Speaker all but abrogated his responsibilities earlier this year, telling the other House leaders they were going to run the show while he concentrated on strategies to get Bob Dole elected President and to raise money for the Republican party.<P>
Opponents think they have a chance to defeat Gingrich because of the dissatisfaction among the current freshman class as well as the fact that a number of older Members were never fond of the one-time fire brand in the first place.  In addition, they believe, incoming freshmen won't have the kind of attachment to the Speaker that this class once had.<P>
As I see it, the challenge to Gingrich, when all is said and done, probably won't work. I think his adversaries ought to step back and look at the situation and then take some action.<P>
First off, they should acknowledge that Gingrich is without peer in proclaiming a vision for their party. It is a party which otherwise lacks vision.  They should be reluctant to toss overboard the one person they have in their midst who has that capability.<P>
Second, they should call the Speaker's bluff when they think he is playing games with them. Newt is, above all, a realist. If he knows he can't get by with the sort of tactics which enrage his opponents he won't try them. The next time they get "woodsheded" for doing the right thing, they should go public with the issue. In such cases, the vast majority of ordinary folks will be with Members trying to do the right thing, not with the Speaker. This is part of Newt's style. Last year, for example, a delegation from Focus on the Family visited the Speaker expressing extreme discomfort at the direction of the Republican party. Gingrich told the delegation if he were in their position, he would threaten a third party. This is exactly the way Gingrich operates.  If things like that become a public issue, the Speaker is not likely to continue down the same path.<P>
Finally, these conservatives should look for someone among their ranks to fill the shoes of Vin Weber and Bob Walker. When Newt Gingrich first came to the Congress back in 1978, he was extremely unfocused.  As a result, he was not taken seriously by his colleagues. Mr. Weber, a former six-term Congressman from Minnesota, recognized great potential in Gingrich. So did Rep. Walker (R-PA), the watchdog of the House floor. Together, they gently but firmly took Newt's hand and helped to organize and focus him. They were an integral part of his success. But Mr. Weber left the Congress in 1992.  Rep. Walker is leaving at the end of this term. Both need to be replaced. Speaker Gingrich came to trust them and rely on them even though initially they were not the best of friends. I would suggest that conservatives disgruntled with the Speaker try to become to Gingrich the kind of assets that Weber and Walker were.  This would afford them the type of positive influence over the Speaker that these two Members had.<P>
Most challenges to Republican leadership figures turn out to be just talk. This challenge, although being discussed by serious Members of the House, will likely also turn out to be just talk.  That is, unless of course, the Speaker himself performs in such a way that he drives Members into the arms of his opponents.<P>

"The Real Solution to Illegal Immigration"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>
"The Real Solution to Illegal Immigration"
<P>
The Senate has passed an immigration bill by a 97 to 3 margin. The bill is similar to a measure which has already passed the House. President Clinton is signaling that he will sign the bill. So our worries about immigration are over, right?<P>
Sorry, but I've heard this one before. In 1986, the same Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming who guided this bill through the Senate, assured us that immigration was going to be under control because employers would be required to verify that a prospective employee was in the country legally. The measure didn't work. It did, however, increase the number of illegal documents in circulation.<P> 
This bill does contain some provisions which have merit. The bill doubles the number of officers on boarder patrol. It also provides for enforcement of the measure, which has been on the books since 1882, regarding legal immigrants. A sponsor is supposed to guarantee that the person he brings to this country will not be on the public assistance rolls for five years after coming here. Since the 1960's that provision has never been enforced. A combination of court decisions and lenient administrations have caused the law to be ignored. This bill gives that measure some teeth if an Administration has the courage to use it.
<P>The legislation also contains a provision for a pilot program to create new documents that would be difficult to copy.  However, one of the bill's chief sponsors, Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), was unable to answer how such a law would keep the new documents out of the hands of those who misrepresent themselves to authorities.
<P> All of this aside, this bill is utterly meaningless without true welfare reform. Welfare reform has been twice vetoed by this President. The reason some immigrants come here is to work. Fine. If they are taking jobs Americans won't fill, I don't have a problem with that. But many illegal immigrants come here for our welfare benefits. Unless, and until, it is clear that we as a society can deny welfare benefits to anyone who is not here legally, no beefed up boarder patrols or document controls are going to mean very much. 
<P>Pass genuine welfare reform and watch the flow of illegal immigrants dry up to manageable proportions. Don't pass welfare reform and watch this bill fail the way the immigration reform bill of 1986 failed. It is almost that simple. 
<P>

"Mayor Should Heed Friends Advice"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>


<P>
It is an American tradition that local politics is always more colorful than national politics. So ordinarily the strange wanderings of a Mayor would not be suitable for a commentary with a national focus. But when it comes to the Mayor of the nation's capital, it is another matter. <P>
Marion Barry is a national, indeed, international figure. So when the Mayor suddenly leaves town for a retreat in St. Louis to reconnect with God and his spirituality, it is news. It is news, even more so, because one of Mayor Barry's closest friends, Rock Newman, who headed up the "Rock The Vote" effort for Barry to return to office in 1994, has now called on the Mayor to resign. The Mayor isn't denying that this is a consideration.<P>
Now, Marion Barry is still recovering from prostate cancer. He has had alcohol and drug problems in the past. He served six months in jail for a charge related to the use of cocaine. His subsequent election as alderman and then comeback as Mayor was called the political miracle of the century.<P>
I am not trying to pile on here. But it was Marion Barry's aides who called the news media in the middle of the night to tell them to show up at the Baltimore airport at 6:30 a.m. Wednesday for a Barry press conference.  The press arrived only to have the Mayor tell the reporters that they should leave him and his wife alone. He was headed to St. Louis to a retreat house. On the surface it is very confusing; but since just about everyone else in this town is offering an opinion about what is happening to the Mayor, I shall offer one of my own.<P>
For decades now, Marion Barry's faith has been in government. Even as a young radical agitator he was always trying to get the government to spend more on his people. He upset the city's establishment in getting elected Mayor. When he did so, he greatly expanded the city government. Marion Barry became a hero to many because he was able to put them on the payroll. His liberal friends in the Congress blessed him with every sort of experimental federal program imaginable. They gave Barry control over billions of federal dollars with which to put more people on the payroll. None of these programs was ever monitored very closely.<P>
Washington, DC, was the laboratory of liberalism. If you needed help, the Mayor had a taxpayer-supported program for you. It worked for a time. But as is the case with all solutions which are not based in reality, the fix was not permanent.<P>
Marion Barry knew the heights of power. While in prison he knew the depths of powerlessness. He vowed he would come back and indeed, five years after he was released from jail, he was back at City Hall. But what the Washington, DC, Mayor came back to was not the same place he left. The consequences of his liberal programs had come back to haunt the city. The population was down. Crime was up. The deficit was high. Private sector jobs were low. New federal programs were out. Federal control over Barry's budget was in.<P>
The politics Marion Barry had practiced so well over so many years had ground to a halt. The Mayor, who was used to solving a problem by giving someone a taxpayer supported job no matter what their skills or productivity, was now virtually powerless to act. He was presiding over a city with sharply increasing problems; a city which no longer could be run by the whims of its Mayor. It was run by tough regulators determined to bring spending under control.<P>
Marion Barry's total faith in government had brought him to this dead end. That is the making of a spiritual crisis. At such times, even people who have disregarded most of what the Bible teaches will turn to the Scriptures. I believe that what is causing at least some of the Mayor's problems is the realization that he has placed his faith in the wrong place. Bigger government did not bring salvation.<P>
Facing the ruins of what once was a well-ordered city, Marion Barry cannot come to grips with reality. Even after the Republicans took over the Congress and made it clear the city was going to have to shape up, Barry went on acting as if nothing had happened. Committee Chairmen and even the minority Democrats on Capitol Hill accused the Mayor of engaging in fantasy. He did not want to believe that the way things had been for decades was now at an end.<P>
The Mayor has come face to face with the real world and he doesn't like what he sees. It doesn't conform to the untruths he has sold himself and his followers. The world as it really exists, which Mayor Barry now confronts on a daily basis, is really an unpleasant place. The instant gratification solutions Barry has applied  all these years are no longer available. 
<P>I wish the Mayor well in reconnecting with God. I hope this time it is the true God and not the gods of liberalism who have been enshrined in Washington these many years. Meanwhile the Mayor would be well to heed the advice of  Rock Newman. The nation's capital could use new leadership that has the ability to cope with the new realities.<P>

"Republicans Should Stick to the Issues" 
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
There is no doubt that Bill Clinton is on a roll. His latest poll numbers show him with an unprecedented 21-point lead over presumed Republican nominee Bob Dole. That poll doesnt even take into account what will happen if, as is likely, Ross Perot runs again and splits the anti-Clinton vote.
<P>All of the dire predictions which many of us made about Clintons foreign policy adventures, especially our involvement in Bosnia, have thus far not come true. For a President who said that domestic issues would be his primary focus, Clinton seems to be making quite a name for himself in the Balkans, in the Middle East, in Russia and  elsewhere.
<P>And while the economy isnt exactly bustling along, growth is probably just adequate enough to prevent electoral problems for the President.
<P>Then there is Whitewater and associated problems. Whitewater was supposed to draw Clinton a primary opponent. It did not. He is the first Democrat since FDR not to have one. he President just made a three-and-a-half-hour videotaped interview for the criminal trial of James and Susan McDougal and Governor Jim Guy Tucker of Arkansas. They are the three charged with conspiracy and fraud in the Whitewater affair. The text of the tape will be released but not the tape itself because the White House believes that Clinton opponents would try to turn the tape into a 60-second commercial.
<P>Whitewater has been in the news since before Clinton took office and yet it has failed to effect the standing of this President. My co-hosts and I debated this on last nights Campaign 96 show with Mark Levine of Landmark Legal Foundation. Levine believes that Clinton is in for big-time trouble down the road on Whitewater. I disagree. I think if, as is probable, Gov. Tucker gets acquitted, Whitewater will be over and done with. To pursue it after such a verdict will simply appear too partisan. Republicans would run the risk of a significant backlash.
<P>The polls show that a majority of the people in the United States believe that the Clintons are hiding something. But the same polls show that the majority doesnt care. The question is why dont they care? Well, first off Whitewater is too complicated to understand. The public will not be interested in this case unless and until there is something simple which they can relate to. They understood Hillary and the cattle futures issue. They understood the Watergate break-in. They understood Chairman Rostenkowskis misdeeds. They dont understand this case. Secondly, whatever the Clintons did, it mostly took place before he was President. True, Vice President Spiro Agnew was driven from office by what he did as Governor of Maryland. But most voters want to know what Clinton has done while President, not something which happened a decade and a half ago. Thirdly, the voters today are cynical about politicians. There is no shock value to the notion that a politician and his wife might be in this game to get something for themselves. In fact the public believes that all politicians are similarly guilty.  Since it is presumed, guilt that is confirmed just doesnt have that much of an impact.<P>
Yes, of course, there is the media which made a national cause out of John Sununu getting dental work while on official business. But the media has not covered Whitewater with any intensity. Still, I cant fault the national media on this one as I have done on many other issues. After Clinton came into office, hundreds of Pulitzer Prize seeking reporters swarmed into Little Rock seeking to break the story that would bring this President down. They did that, not because they disliked Clinton, (most of them voted for him) but because it would bring them more power. Some journalists really worked at it for months going on years, and with unlimited expense accounts. They simply never found the smoking gun.
<P>Looking at Clintons standing with the voters, some Republicans are hoping against hope that Whitewater will turn into something to rescue their fortunes. They are foolish to count on it. If it comes at all, it could well be after this President is re-elected.
<P>I have said from the beginning of this case that I didnt think it would impact politically. Republicans, I suggested, would be well off to make the philosophical case against liberalism and the Clinton Presidency. If something does come of Whitewater they will get an added benefit but meanwhile the 1996 election would be about real issues which matter to the American people. They have not done so. And now they are reduced to hoping that one of Clintons friends will drop something sensational at the Whitewater hearings or that somehow the jury in Arkansas will find Governor Tucker guilty. Thus the reality is that Bob Dole cannot win the Presidency. Only Bill Clinton can lose it. That has never been a winning strategy to gain power in this country. Even if the Republicans do take power under these circumstances, they do so without any mandate to change anything.
<P>It is the ninth-hour and the sun is nearly setting on this election season. It is still not too late for this election to be about opposing philosophies and clear differences on issues. If that case is made, Whitewater wont be needed. If something substantive relating to Whitewater does break between now and the election, it will only underscore the philosophical case which has already been made. It remains to be seen now if, at least, conservatives will stick to the issues this year instead of waiting for the political equivalent of the lottery known as Whitewater.<P>

"Defending Caesar Against God"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>
The Capitol today is filled with believers who are praying for their country. Although the "Washington for Jesus" rally did not live up to the crowd expectations of its promoters, it is nevertheless impressive to see that thousands of people are willing to take time off to come to their nation's capital to ask God's blessing on this land. 
<P>Indeed, it will take the intervention of the Almighty if this nation is going to reverse its course. Yesterday's hearings on assisted suicide, chaired by Rep. Charles Canady of (R-FL), pointed to another tragedy for the nation which is coming at us with thunderous speed. Yet hardly a whimper is heard about it from the nation's religious leaders. <P>
Saving this nation will be up to ordinary people. History is replete with examples of religious leaders who were either silent in the face of great moral crises or who actually cooperated with those inflicting moral crimes on the nation. I am not indicting all religious leaders here. There were a few leaders who did stand up to be counted at the moment of truth and there are some today. But usually those leaders are bucking the trend.<P>
Yesterday some 30 so-called religious leaders from Protestant and Jewish denominations sent President Clinton a letter backing him on the partial birth abortion veto. They wanted to give the President cover for one of the worst decisions ever made by an American President. Clinton's decision even earned him a particular denunciation by the Pope, something which almost never happens. But these Church leaders, including the presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, have seen fit to tell the President he was right in vetoing the bill. They defend Caesar against God.
<P>White House staffers say that the President has actually profited from his stand. The latest Gallop poll, taken after the President's veto, shows that Bill Clinton is leading Bob Dole by the largest margin ever, 58% to 36%. Thus, they claim, the President has done the right thing because the people back him. 
<P>Well, as I said, the ordinary folks, including the generation-X contingent who raised their hands in prayer on the mall today, are the people who will help turn this nation around. They are speaking out against the moral outrages of our time. The "Washington For Jesus" rally held a mock trial with secular society and its deadly sins as defendants. One of the teenagers wore a T-shirt which read, "I fear no evil because He is with me." Indeed, it is evil which stalks the land.
<P>When a six-year-old boy kills a two-month-old child, it is the product of evil. Yet in our time, we scarcely acknowledge evil. In fact, we attempt to turn evil into good. A new movie called "The Craft" attempts to glorify witchcraft. One of the stars of this movie says that all she is trying to do is to show that there is power all around us of which we are unaware. Yes, the power of death. All of these events happening in todays society have something in common. They are all a part of the ancient struggle between life and death. This struggle dates back to when God put man on earth.
<P>Today, however, death has more advocates. Death has the apologists. Death, whether by killing the unborn, or killing the terminally ill, or killing innocent bystanders with guns, or seducing the innocent through witchcraft, or by a thousand other means, death is triumphing over life in contemporary society. But God is life. So what the cult of death really translates to is a rejection of God. 
<P>Don't expect this nation's government or religious leaders to give the principle of life the upper hand. That will depend on the prayers of not only those who could show up in Washington today, but the prayers of all believers, of all faiths, wherever they are in this nation.  In the end it will depend on those who are willing to stand up and intone that ancient refrain, "Choose Life. Choose Life."<P>

Revolution?
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<P>
Last year at this time the new Leadership in the House of Representatives spoke boldly of "revolution." Speaker Gingrich especially insisted that business-as-usual was out; fundamental changes in the way that Washington does business were in. When some of us suggested that the Senate and President Clinton were unlikely to go along with such changes, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston retorted, "President Clinton is irrelevant and the Senate doesn't matter. Not one dime can be spent on a single program unless the House of Representatives okays the spending." Known as the One-House Veto strategy, this was the way Republicans were going to force an end to programs which they considered bad for the country.
<P>What a difference a year makes. Speaker Gingrich may have fun cavorting with Jay Leno or acting as substitute host for "Larry King Live," but these days there is no talk of revolution. The rest of the Republican Leadership tries to put a happy face on what happened with the budget process, but it is hard for them to do. As for Chairman Livingston, he doesn't much like to answer questions on the One-House Veto strategy. 
<P>That is because on substance Bill Clinton won just about everything he fought for in the fiscal year 1996 budget which was finally approved by Congress. Americorps, which is a device to pay volunteers to be active in politics, supporting Clinton and his friends, is still with us. The National Endowment for the Arts, despite its subsidies for pornographic art, is in the budget. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, despite its ability to earn billions by marketing its own products, gets subsidized for a longer term than even budgets approved by Democratic Congresses. The Legal Services Corporation, which over the years has done more harm than any other single federal program I can think of, is alive and well. Goals 2000, which is an attempt to federalize education and to impose "outcome based" methods on local school districts survived because Bill Clinton fought for it and the Republicans were unwilling to stand up and fight against it. The Commerce Department, Department of Education, and even HUD are still with us.  
<P>I could go on and on, but you get the picture. It is true that this budget does cut more money from discretionary programs than even the Republicans had proposed when they first put forth their seven-year balanced budget. So in that sense, the Republicans have a right to some credit. They are actually ahead of where they said they would be in reducing the deficit and getting the budget into balance, which is a little-known fact completely lost in the national debate.
<P>The bad news is that the federal programs the Republicans sought to kill have been funded and will be funded again in the 1997 budget. If Bill Clinton is re-elected and if the Democrats take over Congress, as well they might, these programs will grow again and be right back where they were. True, most of them have been significantly reduced under the newly-approved budget, but the bureaucrats don't care. As long as they stay alive, as long as the infrastructure stays intact, they can survive to fight another day. That is why the freshmen Republicans wanted to pull these programs up by their roots. That is why they proposed eliminating three or four cabinet departments. 
<P>I am not faulting the Republicans because these things didn't happen. The fact is that one election simply isn't enough to turn a nation around which has been heading in the opposite direction for seventy years. What the Republicans should be blamed for is not waging an all-out fight to accomplish the ends which they originally sought. In the process of such a fight they probably would have managed to get half again as much as they got. But even if they didn't, the public would understand what the 1996 election is about.
<P>Elections are best for the country when there are clear-cut differences between the parties. Now everything is fuzzed up. Both sides are claiming credit for the budget. Under these circumstances Bill Clinton and Congressional Democrats win hands down. 
<P>It was said of Bill Clinton that he didn't really believe in anything. Indeed, if you follow his rhetoric, he is masterful in appropriating the themes of his opponents. "The era of big government is over," intoned the President in his "State of the Union" speech. But Bill Clinton fought, and fought hard, for liberal federal programs. He fought on principle. He got every single thing he fought for in one way or the other. I haven't even mentioned the wholesale Republican retreat on environmental issues. 
<P>The problem here is that one side was willing to go all out to win. The other side was embarrassed by what it was fighting for. The Republicans didn't want to defend killing the Endowment for the Arts because too many upper class suburban women gave them a hard time. They didn't want to defend killing the Legal Services Corporation because they heard from too many Republican lawyers who were afraid they would get stuck with more pro-bono work. They didn't want to defend cutting off the government subsidy for PBS lest they see one more bumper sticker proclaiming that Newt killed Barney. 
<P>In short, they didn't have the stomach to face down their opponents. Bob Livingston was right. If the House had stood its ground, none of this would have happened because not a penny can be spent by a President which doesn't get money from both houses of Congress.
<P>The voters are going to take it out on the Republicans for their cowardice because it was they who built up expectations to an unreasonable level. The sad thing is that the freshmen, most of whom fought the good fight even against the wishes of their own Leadership, are likely to get hit the hardest by the voter wrath. And when that happens, the assumption will be made that cutting back federal programs is anathema with the voters and cannot be attempted again. 
<P>No Greek drama or Middles Ages morality play ever had a more tragic ending. 
<P>

"Senator Cochrans Exemplary Actions"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<P>
On occasion, there is honor among politicians and it is worth our taking notice. Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi is Chairman of the Senate GOP Conference. It is one of the top leadership positions in the Senate. He is sort of the Chairman of the Board of all Republican Senators. He has a significant staff. He has occupied the position for six years and no one has even hinted about running against him for that leadership position in the next Congress. Cochran is a shoo-in for a fourth term in the Senate this November.<P> 
But Thad Cochran helped freshmen Senators engineer term limits for the Senate Leadership and Committee Chairmen. As part of a reform package, it was adopted by the majority at the beginning of the 104th Congress last year. Cochran was one of the very few senior Senators to have assisted the freshmen in getting the reforms they sought.<P>
The term limits for Leadership provision grandfathered Cochran and others so the six year time clock would not apply to them for another couple of Congresses. But Thad Cochran is an honorable man. Having been a chief proponent of six year term limits for the Leadership, and his six years as Leader being up at the end of this Congress, Cochran announced that he will not seek re-election as Chairman of the Conference.<P> 
Thus Cochran sets the sort of example inside the Senate which Senator Malcolm Wallop set in 1994 in Wyoming. Wallop was an ardent opponent of term limits. However, the people of Wyoming voted for term limits by more than 70% of the vote. Their vote also grandfathered Wallop, who didn't agree with the outcome, but he felt the people had spoken so he announced that he would abide by their will and retire. That forced the hand of his colleague Alan Simpson who also announced his retirement from the Senate, after three terms, at the end of this Congress. <P>
Cochran's announcement was a thunderbolt in the Senate. Here is a Senator who is actually putting into practice what he says he believes. Cochran's actions will likely effect what other Senators, who have been in the Leadership for many years, will do as well. <P>
One can only speculate what it will mean for Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. If Dole loses the Presidency, the question of his continued leadership in the Senate will be front and center. Dole was first elected Leader following the 1984 election. He has been either Majority Leader or Minority Leader ever since. 
<P>Cochran's principled actions will put Dole in a box. Even though the reforms passed by Senate Republicans specifically exempt the Majority Leader, will Bob Dole, should he lose the Presidency, dare to come back to his colleagues and say, "Others are leaving after six years, but I want my job back for the 13th and 14th year?" I frankly doubt, now that Cochran has done what he has done, Dole would get by with it. For Dateline Washington, I'm Paul Weyrich.

The Independent Council
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

When Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh was busy harassing witnesses over Iran-Contra during the Reagan Administration, Democrats cheered. As Independent Counsel Ken Starr conducts his Whitewater trial in Little Rock, Republicans cheer.<P>
What of the ordinary Americans who are not part of the established political parties? Well, in my opinion, they have little to cheer about when it comes to the way the Independent Counsel system functions. It is a system out of control.<P>
In reality, Independent Counsels are accountable to no one. Lawrence Walsh spent $40 million of taxpayers money, obligating his victims to spend millions of their own money defending themselves. For this he got a couple of forced convictions which probably would not have taken place had Walsh's targets not panicked and agreed to plead guilty. The Independent Counsel, investigating former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, went so far afield in his investigation that he even drew a rebuke from the federal judges who appointed him. <P>
I know that Republican partisans are hoping against hope that Independent Counsel Starr will get convictions in Arkansas. However, there is every indication that Governor Tucker, at least, will be found not guilty and that the Starr investigation may collapse thereafter. Meantime, Democratic Senators Harry Reid of Nevada and John Breaux of Louisiana have called on Starr to resign because of alleged conflicts of interest in his private law practice. Among the charges that these Senators and others make is that Starr represented the Bradley Foundation in a Milwaukee school choice case and the Bradley foundation has provided funds for, among other entities, NET. NET, after all, doesn't approve of much of what the Clinton Administration has done. What many think about the work of Independent Counsels depends upon whose ox is being gored.<P>
Against this background, Congressman Jay Dickey, a Democrat turned Republican from Arkansas, has introduced legislation which would require that after two years the Independent Counsel would be subject to the usual oversight process of the Congress. Such counsels would have to come to the Appropriations Committees to seek a renewal of their funding. Moreover, the Dickey legislation would require that Independent Counsels drop outside legal work while serving in that capacity.  This would prevent accusations of conflict of interest.<P>
Dickey's bill is getting a lot of favorable coverage in Arkansas because it is seen as a slap at Ken Starr. But, in fact, Dickey has made it clear that he has high regard for Starr and does not think the charges of conflict of interest against him are meritorious. Dickey is moving on a principle here. He believes, as do I, that no one should be above our system of checks and balances.
<P>Right now Independent Counsels have a blank check to spend as much as they want for as long as they wish. Their mandate is limitless so they often conduct fishing expeditions at the taxpayers expense. Those of us who believe in a rule of law know very well that our Founding Fathers would have a collective heart attack if they saw this system in operation. 
<P>Dickey's bill should be approved by this Republican Congress. The Democrats would have to vote for it. Senate Democrats certainly could not filibuster the legislation after what they have said about Ken Starr. President Clinton, thinking he will be re-elected, will eagerly sign the legislation.
Regardless of who is in power, this bill is necessary because it will end the highly dubious status of these Independent Counsels who have no accountability.
<P>Two years is enough time to pursue a valid investigation if there is substance to charges being made. In that case, an Independent Counsel will have no problem justifying his work and even a partisan Congress, under pressure from the media, will have to continue an appropriate level of funding. 
This legislation restores some badly needed balance to the system.
<P>The problem here is that some in the Republican Leadership rather enjoy seeing President Clinton and his associates twisting in the wind. They have forgotten what it was like to have Lawrence Walsh on his rampage. Now they've gotten their pay-back at the expense of Bill Clinton. But a pay-back in reverse may be coming with a vengeance if Bob Dole gets to be President. 
<P>No partisan advantage is worth the distortion to our constitutional system which the Independent Counsel system represents. This Congress should immediately pass the Dickey initiative. In fact, Dickey's bill doesn't go far enough for me. The whole system should be repealed. But since the votes aren't there to accomplish that, at least the Dickey bill is a step in the right direction. If the Republican leaders have any sense of integrity they will act on the Dickey measure forthwith. 
<P>

"Republicans Have Lost Their Vigor"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>These are dark days for the Republicans.<P>
<ul>
<LI> Speaker Newt Gingrich says his party is in a funk.
<LI> Former Cabinet Secretary Bill Bennett says that the campaign of GOP Presidential nominee Bob Dole is uninspiring and unfocused. Bennett suggests that Dole step down as Majority Leader. 
<LI> Liberal attacks on Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr have begun to take hold. The Democrats believe they can now blunt the effects of any convictions which might come out of the current Arkansas trial as well as any revelations from concurrent Senate hearings. 
<LI> Democrats in Congress unite to defeat any and all significant Republican initiatives on any legislation, leaving Bill Clinton in the driver's seat. 
<LI> The respected political analyst Charles Cook now says the Democrats have a one-in-three chance of recapturing the Congress, something which would have been unthinkable six months ago. 
<LI> Organized labor is spending huge sums of money targeting freshmen Republicans on the minimum wage through radio and TV commercials. No comparable spending is countering this from the Republican side.
<LI> Talk show host Rush Limbaugh, one of the most reliable parties supporting Republicans on the air, now says he may file for a trial separation from the Republican party because he doesn't want to be associated with people who are unwilling to stand up and fight for what they say they believe. 
<LI> All polls now show Bill Clinton leading Bob Dole by double digits. Polls also show Democrats in the lead for Congress. 
</UL>
<P>As I say, these are not happy times for Republicans. Rush Limbaugh is on to something. The problem here is not that the electorate has suddenly turned liberal. The problem is not that the so called mainstream media is more vicious than they were during the 1994 election season, for example. The problem is not that the liberals suddenly have a set of ideas which have captured the imaginations of the American people. The problem is not that times are so good that it is inevitable that the incumbent President will win. 
<P>The problem is simply this: The Republicans have lost all passion for their beliefs. A year ago, as they worked through the Contract with America, Republicans fought for their ideas with great conviction and the public was with them. They did so, it turns out, because they were dead certain that Bill Clinton would collapse from the momentum they had started. Republicans had but one battle plan: force Clinton to surrender, then declare victory and go on to the next triumph. 
<P>But Bill Clinton did not surrender. In fact, Bill Clinton rallied his troops. There seems to be a lot of passion left in those who believe in big government. The Republicans collapsed, not Bill Clinton. The Republicans began to compromise and compromise and compromise. The more they gave in, the more the Democrats united in the Senate to stop Republican initiatives. The more the initiatives died, the less the Republicans wanted to continue fighting for them. Now all the intensity is on the side of the Democrats who smell the chance to come back to power in a major way. 
<P>Republicans, meanwhile, are paying lip service to a host of good ideas in which they once insisted they really believed. These range from term limits to cutting out harmful federal programs to medical savings accounts. The problem is that there is no passion behind their rhetoric. They give their supporters little to get excited over. Compare what is happening today to the fight the Republicans waged against Bill and Hillary's health care plan in the 103rd Congress. The intensity back then was all with the Republicans. 
<P>So what happened? What happened is simply this. The mainstream media attacked the Republicans vigorously. Some among their ranks couldn't take the heat. They urged compromise. Republican leaders tried to appease this group through compromise. Democrats, upon hearing of proposed compromises, sensed weakness and decided to go for the jugular. 
<P>Then came the 1995 off-year elections. Republicans lost them. Fear and panic swept their ranks. They offered more compromise, emboldening the Democrats, who managed to get themselves together after having been badly split last year. Republicans, then, all but threw in the towel on a variety of issues, demoralizing their own troops. This, combined with a bruising Republican primary season where all the passion and excitement was with the losing candidates for President, brought us to where we are today. 
<P>Limbaugh is essentially correct. If the Republicans don't want to go all out to fight for their ideas, if they don't want to stand up and defend themselves, and if they don't want to be on the offensive instead of the defensive, then they do not deserve the blind loyalty of Limbaugh or anyone else. Defeat is not inevitable. But as any good coach knows, to win on the playing field you have to believe in your own team. If the Republicans don't believe in their own ideas enough to fight for them, then they shouldn't be surprised when people who believe in contrary ideas, no matter how wrong they may be, end up trouncing them for good. 
<P>If the Republicans keep going where they are going, they will give Limbaugh one more chance to say, "See, I told you so."

"Liberal Media Bias"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>

<P>
<P>
Speaker Newt Gingrich said yesterday that if the news media really believes so much in affirmative action, they should hire conservative Republicans. Gingrich was reacting to a Freedom Forum study, released by the Gannett-sponsored organization last week, which demonstrates that reporters covering politics and government are predominately liberal. 92% voted for President Clinton, as compared with 43% of the population as a whole. 
<P>
The study reveals something else, however, which is in my view, even more disturbing. It highlights the overwhelming cynicism of the national media toward anyone serving in office. This cynicism is especially pronounced, no doubt, when reporters cover politicians with whom they disagree.
<P>When I worked in the newsroom of a major metropolitan daily during the 1964 Presidential campaign, the reporters were overwhelmingly for the re-election of Lyndon Johnson. In fact, out of a staff of close to 100, I found only four supporters of the Republican nominee, Barry Goldwater. Editorially, the itself supported Goldwater, but the reporters who covered the campaign were against him. <P>

I have to say that, by and large, the professionalism of this group of reporters overcame their bias. Goldwater got fair coverage from the Milwaukee Sentinel despite the views of the reporters covering him.  When President Eisenhower got such a thunderous ovation at the 1964 GOP convention in San Francisco for criticizing the media, he was referring to columnists and editorial writers, not news reporters. Eisenhower suggested that lots of people were giving advice to the Republicans -- pundits who would, themselves, never vote for Republican candidates. The delegates roared their approval. 
<P>Today, the situation is reversed. In most papers the majority of columnists are from the center-right point of view. Even dedicated liberal papers such as the Washington Post and the New York Times have conservative columnists. Where those who believe in limited government, free enterprise, a strong national defense and traditional moral values take it on the chin is on the reportorial side of the equation. The people who cover the news are no longer taught, as they were when I was a reporter, that their personal opinions are not to show up in their reporting. <P>

The change came during Watergate. Prior to that time, there had been a small group of advocacy journalists who had made their way into America's newsrooms. They were in conflict with the traditional journalists who believed that their responsibility was to cover news, not to make news. When the Washington Post brought down the Nixon Administration, the advocacy journalists had won the day. Traditional journalists could no longer prevail because what the advocacy journalists had accomplished was to make the media a fourth and most powerful branch of government. 
<P>From that time to the present, the cynicism of journalists, many of whom do not hide their point of view, is overwhelming. They begin with the presumption that politicians, especially ones with whom they disagree, are guilty. All that remains is for them to identify the wrong the politicians have done. 
<P>
It is inconceivable, in the minds of these reporters, that the freshmen Republicans who got elected in 1994 actually believe in something and want the country to change. Rather, the reporters believe these freshmen have to be serving some special interests. They must be fronting for big money. Or at the very least they are serving their own interests. 
<P>It is not only a liberal bias, but this cynicism, which makes for the sort of coverage that has caused Speaker Gingrich to tell supporters that over the next six months they must become "personal radio stations" to overcome the bias of the media. The preference for liberal and Democratic politicians was in the newsrooms more than 30 years ago. What is different between now and then is that editors back then insisted that personal views be kept out of the news pages. This didn't always happen, of course, but the bias was subdued. Today the bias is blatant. 
<P>The only cure for this in the long run is the market place. Newspapers are in a state of steep decline. Each time new ratings come out, network television has lost some additional viewers to rival cable or direct broadcast channels. At some point, the owners of these media properties will stop being in a state of denial and will begin to examine their coverage. It is then that they may insist once again that advocacy journalism is for opinion columns and commentaries. 
<P>So when reading newspaper coverage makes you so angry you can't see straight, or when watching television news makes you want to smash the set, contribute to the growing market forces which will change the system. Don't buy the paper. And turn off that channel. There are other sources of news. The more you patronize the other sources instead of the ones which distort reality, the sooner the owners of the so-called mainstream media will be forced, for their own economic well being, either to change things or get out of the business.<P>

"Earth Day' its Own Religion"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>

<P>
Thirty-two years ago today, two momentous things happened. Our first
daughter, Dawn Ceol, was born and the first "Earth Day" was proclaimed.
There is no connection between the two, I can assure you, although Dawn has
shown a lot of interest in gardening of late. <P>
It is true enough that we human beings have been given custody of earth and
that we should take appropriate care of what has been entrusted to us. 
But it is also true that in the Book of Genesis, it is clear that man was
given dominion over the earth. There was not a word from God suggesting that
we should preserve everything just as it was created. Quite the contrary,
God gave man an intellect and the ability to develop the earth.<P> 
Rather than a call for us to be responsible, as we continue to make progress
in unlocking what God knows anyway, "Earth Day" has become an ideology or a
substitute religion. The underlying assumption behind this ideology is that
the earth was created in a pristine state and it is man who is the problem.
If only we didn't spoil the earth with our use of resources, then we could
live in the beauty of nature again.<P> 
No one defends the real polluters. No one suggests that all businesses or
individuals have been completely responsible or even efficient in the use of
natural resources. But the idea that we are the problem is a direct denial
of God's word in Genesis. And that is the heart of the conflict over "Earth
Day." <P>
While not all who celebrate this occasion have adopted that philosophy,
those who have created the occasion have a neo-Pantheism at the heart of
what they believe. They worship not the God of creation, but nature itself.
These views are hardly new. We have evidence of similar ideas going back to
ancient times. Since nature is to be elevated, and man is to be subject to
nature, of course private property becomes an outmoded concept.<P> 
Nature, so many of the "Earth Day" advocates believe, cannot be confined to
a single individual but belongs to us all. Private property flies in the
face of this ideology. So behind the niceties of celebrating the beauties of
the natural state of the earth is an attack on the individual and his
rights. Thus it is fair to say that most so-called "Greens" are only green
on the outside. At the core they are red or at least pink.<P> 
When all is said and done there is little difference between what the
radical elements of the "Earth Day" movement believe and what the Marxists
teach. I say teach, because if you have ever visited a Communist nation you
will note that the reality is in stark contrast to Marxist beliefs. This is
especially true about the environment. At all of the international meetings,
the Communists were always pushing the Green agenda. Yet they left their own
nations in environmental ruins. <P>
So on this "Earth Day," while mindful of the importance of taking good care
of what has been entrusted to us temporarily, I prefer to celebrate Dawn's
birthday instead. She has been an outstanding example of what it means to
develop one's God given talents. I'd rather trust Dawn and her good husband
Ed to do good things with the property they own, then to put my trust in an
ideology which defies not only the Scriptures but reality as well. So Happy
Birthday, Dawn. Now get busy in your garden.
<P>

"Another Off-Book Mistake"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>


Congressman Bud Shuster (R-Pennsylvania) led a successful effort in the House of Representatives to pass his Truth-in-Budgeting bill by a vote of 284-143. The Shuster measure takes the Transportation Trust Fund out of the budget. This presumably would release more of the money collected through transportation taxes to be spent on local roads and other projects. On the surface that seems fair enough. People pay taxes on gasoline and airline tickets and the money should be spent for projects relating to their taxation.
<P>
The problem is that the transportation trust funds are used to offset other spending in the federal budget. So, in effect, this move means that another $30 billion will have to be cut from discretionary domestic spending to balance the budget if the Shuster measure should become law. That is why Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich (R-Ohio) and Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston (R-Louisiana) strongly opposed the bill. "We will never eliminate the deficit if we give some programs exalted, protected status," Livingston said.
Another opponent, Rep. Chris Shays (R-Connecticut) said, "While some call it the Truth-in-Budgeting Act, I would call it the Unbalanced Budget Act of 1996 or frankly the Pork Barrel Bill of 1996."
<P>
Shays and Livingston are correct. Even this strongly conservative House of Representatives couldn't bring itself to eliminate the Legal Services Corporation, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, or the National Endowment for the Arts. That being the case, who is going to seriously suggest that this Congress or a subsequent Congress is going to come up with another $30 billion in domestic budget cuts to balance the budget?
<P>
This is just another attempt to hide spending off-book. As Harrison Fox of Citizens for Budget reform has pointed out, the off-book obligations of the federal government are greater than those of the federal budget and in many cases more dangerous because they are hidden from the public. I have complained about the Senate stopping most of the reforms which the House has passed in this Congress. Well, this is one time I hope the Senate doesn't go along with what the House has passed. 

<P>
In theory, Congressman Shuster is right. In practice, this measure would be a disaster and would move us that much further away from ever bringing our budget into balance.
<P>

<h2>Smut assault forces return to censorship</h2>     
<br>By <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
<dd>I remember the first time I saw a dirty picture as a child. I was babysitting a neighbor's kids in the apartment building where I lived and spied a pin-up calendar hung inside an open closet door. I recall being scared to close the door, lest anyone remember it had been left ajar, and too timid to take a closer look, in case either parent returned unexpectedly. Little impression of the picture itself remains: a buxom blonde in Li'l Abner costume, breasts partially exposed.
<dd>Such innocent times. I thought of that picture again recently on a trip to Manhattan. I was tired after a long day of meetings and speeches and decided to spend the evening in my room at the Yale Club, ordering in room service and mindlessly watching TV. Unlike most hotels these days, the Yale Club offers no in-room movies, just basic cable service. 
<dd>Too lazy to cross the room and examine the TV Guide, I used the remote to move from channel to channel looking for something to watch. Shortly after 10:00 PM, my channel surfing swept me into unchartered waters. Suddenly I was staring at writhing, naked bodies: three young men, black and white, one wearing only a studded dog-collar; another, a gold cross hanging between his pectorals. 
<dd>I saw more. Simulated sex acts, close ups of tumescent genitals and other body parts and most memorably, the faces of the men, boys really, barely older than my children. After a few minutes, I switched the channel, unable to watch anymore, not even to try to learn what program it was I had happened upon. 
<dd>As shocking as the experience was, I'll survive this unwanted brush with gay pornography. But what about children or adolescents who happen to tune in? And they will, especially those who are already most vulnerable, whose parents aren't around or don't care what their kids are up to at 10 o'clock at night. What effect will those pictures have on the young? 
<dd>After this episode I learned that the cable franchise in New York City has tried unsuccessfully to limit this channel to those customers who send in postcards requesting it, free of charge. A federal district court judge considered this imposition too onerous, stigmatizing those with pornographic tastes. Apparently the judge did not feel it too burdensome to require parents to learn to program their cable boxes if they wished to keep images of sodomy off the family TV. He issued an injunction prohibiting the franchise from blocking the channel, which now remains part of the basic service that
comes into every cable subscriber's home. 
<dd>In his new book Slouching Toward Gomorrah: Modern Liberalism and American Decline, Robert Bork suggests that maybe it is time to re-instate censorship in America. "From the earliest colonies on this continent over 300 years ago, and for about 175 years of our existence as a nation, we endorsed and lived with censorship," Bork argues. That changed dramatically in 1973 when the Supreme Court in Miller vs. California established new standards to determine what may be banned. Courts since then have been reluctant to ban any sexual material as long as it involves "consenting adults." 
<dd>Barely 50 years ago, Bork reminds us, the Supreme Court unanimously wrote: "There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem. These include the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or 'fighting' words." 
<dd>How far we've come since then. Now the First Amendment is regularly invoked to protect as "speech" forms of expression that include "snuff" films that depict the sexual torture and murder of women and children, photographs and videos of men and women having sex with animals, and other abominations too numerous to mention. 
<dd>It is unimaginable that our Founders would have sanctioned this interpretation of the First Amendment, which after all was intended originally to protect political speech deemed necessary for democracy to function, indeed thrive. Are we a freer society today by virtue of being exposed to all manner of filth and smut? Are our children more likely to grow up good, informed citizens ready to perform their democratic duties because they have listened to a steady stream of misogynist and hedonist rock and rap lyrics on the public airwaves? 
<dd>Unless the Supreme Court can see its way out of the morass it has created, maybe it is time to consider amending the First Amendment. Twenty-five years of radical First Amendment jurisprudence on pornography has turned much of the popular culture into a Styxian cesspool. And those of us who would like to avoid being drowned there are told we are anti-democratic. 
<dd>Why must I carefully avoid scanning television channels, or pretend I don't hear the suggestive words emanating from the radio when I take a taxi? Why must I look at sneering, crotch-clutching models in their underwear on the side of city buses? And how am I expected to protect my children if I choose? 
<dd>Surely liberty is not synonymous with licentiousness. And if judges cannot tell the difference, the people will have to show them the way, which is what real democracy is all about.

<title>Pete Du Pont-- Silence of the Lamm -- 08/14/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/">
<img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p>
<i>Wednesday, August 14, 1996</i><p>


<h2>Silence of the Lamm</h2><p>

<a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/dupont.html">Pete du Pont</a><p> 
<i>Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis</i><p>

So, is America ready for a third-party?  Ross Perot thinks so.  So 
does David Broder of the Washington Post, who writes that by 2000, a 
third party will be a major political force in America.
<p>
But if there were a third party, what would it stand for?  What would 
its policies be?  These are the questions bothering the third party we 
already have - Ross Perot's Reform Party - because to date it is a 
party of one man, not a party of ideas.  If it is going to have any 
impact on the American political process, the Reform Party must become 
a party of ideas.
<p>
Take the case of former three-term Colorado Governor Dick Lamm, who is 
trying to get his message out to members of the Reform Party in a 
effort to win the party's nomination for president.  So far, he has 
had only moderate success
<p>
Lamm contends that the Reform Party, founded and largely funded by 
Perot, has hampered his campaign by refusing to let him have members' 
addresses so that he could reach them by mail.  In addition, his 
repeated requests to debate Perot were declined.  Reform Party 
officials deny having done anything to hinder Lamm's campaign or his 
ability to reach party members.
<p>
Lamm stepped into the Reform Party process for two reasons:  He wanted 
a national platform on which to discuss the problems American is 
facing and he apparently believed Perot when for months the Reform 
Party founder denied having any desire to be nominated and run for 
president of the United States.
<p>
Unfortunately, the national media have focused almost entirely on the 
internal struggle for power rather than the issues Lamm and the Reform 
Party have been pushing.  As a result, Lamm's message has been 
silenced.
<p>
But were he able to get his message out he would warn Americans of a 
number of impending problems.  For example:
<p>
<b>Social Security reform</b> - The Social Security system is going bankrupt.  
At its current rate of growth, the trust fund will begin drawing on 
reserves by the year 2013 and will be broke by 2030.  Since our 
elderly population is growing much more rapidly than workers, there 
simply won't be enough workers to keep Social Security solvent.  The 
later we wait, the worse it will be, so we must develop a solution 
now.
<p>
<b>Medicare reform</b> - Medicare is going bankrupt even faster than Social 
Security.  According to Medicare's trustees' report, Medicare Part A 
(which pays hospital bills) will go into the red by 2000 and be broke 
just a year or so later.  Republicans passed a Medicare reform 
proposal, only to have it viciously attacked by the Democrats.  As a 
result, the notion that Medicare is politically untouchable is 
prevailing once again.  That's an attitude we can't financially 
maintain for long.
<p>
<b>Fiscal responsibility</b> - Reagan-era tax cuts increased federal revenues 
between 1981 and 1989 by an average of 1.8 percent per year, after 
inflation.  Unfortunately, the Democrat-led Congress increased 
spending by 2.3 percent.  That disparity explains the increased 
deficit spending during the Reagan years.  Bob Dole wants to cut 
taxes, but keep the budget balanced.  Would Lamm do the same?
<p>
The problem is that Dick Lamm has spoken out on these and a number of 
other issues over the years, but the media have focused so much on 
Lamm's political struggles, they have failed to give due attention to 
his solutions to our problems.
<p>
That's too bad, because Lamm is a serious politician with a message 
Americans need to hear and consider.  His may indeed be a "root-canal" 
vision of our future - all cuts and no gains - but it is a very 
definite political message that may force the Republicans and 
Democrats to deal with politically difficult issues that candidates 
might otherwise sweep under the table.
<p>
I don't believe Lamm's message will resonate.  Americans are 
optimists, believing, in Steve Forbes' words, in "hope, growth, and 
opportunity."  Lamm's pessimism will be a hard sell.  Further, I would 
disagree with those who say there is a political longing unfulfilled 
by the Democratic and Republican parties.
<p>
To have an impact, third-party candidates will need to debate the 
message, not the man.  So far all we've heard is Ross Perot.  Maybe 
it's time to see what Dick Lamm has to say.  
<p>

<i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.</i><br>

 <i> September 4, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2>Brown v. Board of Ed, Pt. II</h2><p>


<i>If you're sick and tired of judicial activism, take heart. It may not last much longer.</i><p>



"We are constrained by many rules and taxed for many costs that we as self-governing people did not choose for ourselves but were chosen for us by judges who thought they knew better," observes Richard Morgan, professor of Constitutional Law and Government at Bowdoin College. Writing in the Summer issue of the Manhattan Institute's City Journal, Morgan argues that the 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education "ushered in the modern era in constitutional law," an era in which the courts came to be viewed "as a source of governmental power that could force unpopular changes that could not be secured through representative institutions." Over the last three decades, the courts "have removed issue after issue from the arena of popular decision and subjected them to judicial control."<p>

Morgan laments the dramatic changes that have taken place in America since the 1960s, "when judicial social engineering based on the Brown model took hold. Huge new bodies of judge-made law constrain us on all sides," he observes. "New restrictions on what Americans can do in their communities, state legislatures, and the national Congress are being fabricated apace. It is no accident that this period of imperial expansion by the judiciary coincides with a period of precipitous increase in the American social problems and a decline in the quality of life, especially in our cities," says Morgan. "The courts did not cause the decline, but they often have made it more difficult for communities, through the processes of self-government, to cope with their problems. In the decades since Brown we have seen our churches and other voluntary institutions . . . increasingly isolated from the public square; we have seen our schools destabilized, our law enforcement enfeebled, the maintenance of order in our streets undermined, and major public-sector institutions taken over and run by judges."<p>

There was no popular support for such judicial abuse in the beginning, nor is there any now, and yet it continues. "After decades of conservative electoral outcomes and hundreds of state and federal judicial appointments intended to end 'judicial legislation,' and with public opinion sullenly resistant to much of the social engineering ordered from the bench, how is it that legally unjustified judicial interventions into policy making and administration still occur routinely?" asks Morgan. "Why does our sprawling 'rights industry' continue to grow and succeed so often in persuading judges to establish policies that cannot be put in place through the normal democratic processes of election and legislation?"<p>

Though leaving such questions unanswered, Richard Morgan insists that the days of judicial activism are numbered. He argues that "curtailing judicial legislation is an absolutely essential part of reinvigorating self-government and arresting social decline in America at the end of the century." The best way to begin, says Morgan, is by recognizing the error in Brown.<p>

<title>Defending Gingrich -- Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3>Defending Gingrich</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
January 23, 1997 <br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Where have all the great leaders gone?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	That's a question I've heard many times. My answer is: It's not that America no longer produces great men and women. It's that our political and media establishments no longer revere the qualities that make for greatness. They even turn on greatness when it threatens their complacency.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I would submit to you that no one poses a greater threat to the complacency of the Washington establishment than Newt Gingrich, narrowly re-elected Speaker of the House of Representatives, and leader of a noble campaign to get Washington off the backs of American families and workers. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Ever since young Congressman Gingrich had the temerity to challenge then-House Speaker Tip O'Neil in the 1980s, the Washington establishment has had it in for Gingrich. It comes as no surprise that the business-as-usual crowd eventually drew blood.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It's not just that Gingrich favors balancing Washington's checkbook, lessening the burden of taxes on American families, giving authority and autonomy back to states and localities, and giving all Americans greater economic independence by reforming welfare, Medicare and Social Security (three of Washington's biggest power-grabbing programs).  

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It's that he has forced President Clinton to sign on to all of these objectives, albeit in different forms, which cut at the heart of big government. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Say what you want about Gingrich. But he believes his ideas passionately, pursues them relentlessly, and is willing to take a beating for it. When all the smoke clears, he frequently comes out on top. By contrast, Americans still are trying to figure out what the occupants of the White House believe.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To the Washington establishment, Gingrich is clearly the devil. His 104th Congress eliminated 270 federal programs, agencies, offices and projects. It enacted farm and telecommunications reform, changing antiquated laws dating back to the Depression. The 104th Congress also reduced discretionary domestic spending by $53 billion. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	His revolution is rolling. It wasn't repudiated by the voters in 1996 as liberals believed it would be. The 105th Congress is on the brink of truly ending the era of big government and re-instituting the era of citizen-directed self-government. Bill Clinton was re-elected because he sang Gingrichisms like a canary: lower taxes, balanced budgets, family values.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	How did Gingrich pull off this victory? By being the lightning rod and taking the heat. Like any great leader, he recognized that since his cause was just, the only thing his opponents could attack was himself. Accepting this, he didn't buckle, and while his enemies attacked, the victory was being won.  And more victories lie ahead.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Heck, Newt Gingrich even admits and apologizes for his mistakes! By contrast, can you imagine hearing  an admission of guilt or an apology -- about far worse "ethical lapses" than anything even dreamed of by Gingrich -- from other key players in Washington? 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"We are at the end of a 60-year cycle of liberalism," he said recently before The Heritage Foundation President's Club. "We had to have at the national level a great debate about where we were going. And that debate was a confrontation with those on the left who still believe in redistribution of wealth, centralized bureaucracy, command-and-control planning."

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	With so much at stake, someone had to take the heat. According to some polls, Newt Gingrich is now one of the most unpopular men in America. But when was the last time you could look at a national leader and say, "Here is someone willing to suffer public humiliation for doing what is right?"

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This is one leader who deserves another look

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<title>Fumento:Crime Rate Decline Calls for Introspection--and Caution</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i>January 22, 1997</i><p>
<h2>Crime Rate Decline Calls for Introspection--and Caution</h2><p>     
<P>
<dd>
Hallelujah! Praise the lord and DON'T pass the ammunition!  Why?  Because across the
country, murder rates are plummeting. According to new FBI figures, the rate fell 7 percent
in the first half of 1996, continuing a three-year trend.
<br>
<dd>     
The down side of this is that next to other western countries, the United States is still 
comparable to a World War I battlefield. Whatever we may be doing right, we need to be doing
a lot more. But what ARE we doing, anyway?
<br>
<dd>     
First, let's make clear that anybody who says there's a simple or complete answer is either
lying to you or to themselves. That includes the claims of Sheriff Wild Bill Clinton that he
done rode them varmints outta town on a rail.
<br>
<dd>
"Crime has dropped in the last four years as we worked to put 100,000 police on the streets,"
he said in his January 4 radio address.  He has also repeatedly given credit to the Brady
Bill, which requires a waiting period and background check for handgun purchasers.
<br>
<dd>
But note Clinton's careful wording about those cops. He said he worked to put them there, not
that they actually exist. Indeed, for the most part they don't. Studies show that at most
the legislation has added about 17,000 new officers, and many of those would have been added
anyway but are now simply paid for out of federal funds instead of local ones.
<br>
<dd>
As to the Brady bill, Mrs. Brady humbly boasted at the Democratic National Convention that
her husband's namesake law "has helped keep more than 100,000 felons and other prohibited
purchasers from buying handguns."
<br>
<dd>     
Actually, the White House itself has only claimed 60,000, and a General Accounting Office
report last year found that half of those rejected were for administrative reasons--mostly
paperwork errors. Only 5 percent were rejected because of violent crime convictions and most
probably just proceeded to buy a gun on the streets.
<br>
<dd>
Thus, a University of Chicago study found recently that the Brady Bill was about as effective
as "The Brady Bunch" in preventing crime.
<br>
<dd>
The main way we know that neither Clinton nor anyone in the federal government deserves
credit for falling crime is that about 95 percent of crime is handled by state and local
agencies. That's easily measured, because about 95 percent of the criminals behind bars are
there on state charges, not federal ones.
<br>
<dd>
So what were some of those state and local initiatives that might have helped reduce violent
crime?
<br>
<dd>
One was pointed to in the aforementioned University of Chicago study, which found a direct
correlation between the increasing number of states allowing people to carry concealed
firearms and decreasing violent crimes in those states.  Apparently, many criminals start
rethinking their careers when they realize their next potential victim may exercise his or
her constitutional right to blow their attacker's head off.
<br>
<dd>
The Chicago study made gun control advocates so hot you could have fried eggs on their
heads. Nevertheless, they were unable to refute the data, which showed that when such laws
went into effect in a county, murders fell by 8.5 percent, and rapes and aggravated assaults
fell by 5 and 7 percent, respectively.
<br>
<dd>
On the other hand, the major city with the highest drop in murders, New York, has no such
provision for carrying concealed weapons.  New York may be reaping the benefits of what
criminologist James Q. Wilson has called the "broken glass" effect.
<br>
<dd>
Basically, this means officers take the time to follow up on and prevent even the little crimes
like vandalism that formerly they ignored in favor of concentrating on big crimes. By paying
attention to lesser infractions, the theory goes, the police instill respect for the law and
uphold values in neighborhoods. This then cuts down on the occurance of major crimes.
<br>
<dd>
Clearly something wonderful is happening in the Big Apple, and the broken glass theory
deserves continued application and observation.
<br>
<dd>     
A steady rise in prison capacity may also be helping to reduce violent crime rates.
Since 1980, the nation's prison population has tripled.  Just in the last two years, the
population of state and federal prisons has increased by almost 14 percent.  In the last
four years, the average time served for serious crimes increased by a half.
<br>
<dd>     
In 1994, of those seeking parole, almost 80 percent were denied.  By contrast, in 1990 80
percent who sought parole got it.
<br>
<dd>
But before we wear out our palms slapping ourselves on the back for the decreasing crime
rate, a little humility and caution are in order. Without doubt, one major factor has simply
been a decline in the portion of the populace that is at the age that commits violent
crimes.
<br>
<dd>
Further, to listen to highly respected criminologists like Dr. John Diulio at Princeton
University and David Kopel at the Independence Institute in Colorado, we may just be in the
eye of the storm.
<dd>
The reason?  "It's not just the age of the population, but the conditions under which
it was raised," Kopel explains.  And more and more of our kids are being raised without fathers. 
Without fathers, young men don't turn to Hillary Clinton's "village," to raise them; they
turn to gangs and criminal activity. 
<br>
<dd>
"In 2010 we may be reaping a whirlwind from the family-wrecking policies of the  70s, 80s,
and  90s," says Kopel.  I pray he's wrong.  I fear he may be right.

<h2>
The American President
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Kathleen Howley
</a>

<P>
Everyone needs a hobby. Mine is trying to figure out the way Liberals 
think. Every time I think I have it nailed down, though, the Liberals 
pitch a curve ball.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Take, for example, "The American President," the movie about a highly 
paid female lobbyist who has an affair with the widowed President of 
the United States.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To Liberals, she's an "old-fashioned girl," because, after all, she 
waits until the third date to spend the night at the White House. Not 
the first date, mind you -- she's no tramp, after all. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The president's young daughter gets wind of the ongoing affair. She 
approves, as it turns out. When the relationship becomes public and 
some Angry White Male Conservative senators object, they're dismissed 
as being "intolerant."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Of course, the simple solution to the controversy is for the president 
and his girlfriend to get married. It would shut up the big, bad 
Conservatives, and, since it's an election year, it would also give 
the president a boost in the polls. The whole country would fawn over 
the newlyweds. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But, it never comes up. The word "marriage" is never spoken -- not by 
the Conservatives, as they plot their election coup. Not by the happy 
couple, as they snuggle in front of the fire at Camp David. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Here's the part that's hard to understand: Liberals perceive the 
president -- a character modeled, obviously, on a spiffed up version 
of Bill Clinton -- as a man of integrity, despite the bad example he 
sets for his daughter. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That view becomes apparent in the final scene, when the president 
makes a dramatic stand in defense of Liberal environmental 
legislation. Yes, I could almost hear the Clintonites sobbing in 
admiration. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
How could a character with no moral backbone be portrayed as being 
honorable? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's the same question I was left with at the end of "Primary Colors," 
the anonymous account of the Clinton campaign.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sure, Gov. Jack Stanton (read: Clinton) sleeps with every female in 
sight. Sure, he impregnates the teenage daughter of a friend. Sure, 
he's a pathological lier.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
He really CARES about America, though. And that makes everything all 
right.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Meanwhile, Mrs. Stanton/Clinton is no slacker when it comes to 
extramarital affairs. According to the book, she sleeps with Henry 
Burton, alias George Stephanopoulos. But, that's dismissed as merely 
being "campaign sex."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At the end of "Primary Colors," Gov. Stanton/Clinton is presented with 
some under-cover dirt on his opponent. Leaking it to the press would 
secure the primary nomination. But, it's just dirt about sex and drugs 
-- nothing really bad, from a Liberal's perspective. Should he use it? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of his aides tells him, "We don't do this sort of thing. We're 
better than that." In the end, Stanton/Clinton decides to take the 
high road.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Once again, I could almost hear the Liberals weeping in admiration. 
What a man of courage! What a leader!  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It explained to me why there have been no denials forthcoming from the 
White House about the book -- no statements of shock or dismay. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You see, to Liberals, it's a relatively positive portrayal. Yes, the 
candidate has a fatal flaw in his inability to be faithful to his 
wife. But, that doesn't really count. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
He refused to engage in "dirty tricks." And that makes him a hero. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You might ask yourself: how could two groups of Americans -- Liberals 
and Conservatives -- view the same events with such a radically 
different interpretation? How can Liberals dismiss sexual morality 
from the mix, when deciding who has integrity and who doesn't? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More to the point, how can the Liberal-dominated media lionize 
characters who have such obvious flaws? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's because the Liberals are working from a different set of rules. 
And, as long a politician doesn't break the Liberal code of 
conduct, he's a man of integrity. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In short, they follow Ten Commandments, too. But, they're a bit 
different from the code that has guided Christians through the 
millenniums. The Liberal version is: 
<p>
<ol> 
<li>) Thou shalt be nice, except to people who are Conservatives. 
<li>) Thou shalt be inclusive, except to Conservative views. 
<li>) Thou shalt ignore the Lord's Day, unless you are a politician and 
need a "photo op" as you exit a church. 
<li>) Thou shalt blame thy mother and thy father. 
<li>) Thou shalt kill the old, the sick, and the unborn, but 
passionately defend the lives of death row criminals. (Unless you're 
an election-year politician who wants to look "tough on crime." In 
that case, kill them all, including the criminals.) 
<li>) Thou shalt commit adultery, and engage in any other mode of 
sexual expression, with any gender. But, thou shalt not feel guilty. 
<li>) Thou shalt steal, if it helps to re-distribute wealth. 
<li>) Thou shalt lie, if it furthers the Liberal cause. 
<li>) Thou shalt covet thy neighbors wife. 
<li>) Thou shalt covet thy neighbors goods. 
</ol>

<h2>Setting an Example</h2> 
<i>Jan. 3, 1997</i>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<p>

I usually refrain from commenting on people before they have been formally charged, but the recent news regarding Michael Irvin has me thinking -- Is there anyone in the public eye left that our children can look up too. 
<P>
It seems that wherever we look, another athlete or movie star has had another run-in with the law. Whether it is Irvin's cocaine problem and the latest rape incident, or the late Snoop Doggy-Dog with his gangster lifestyle, our children are witnessing the demoralization of America first hand.  Each time one of their favorite stars fall, a child must lose a bit of faith in humanity. It must be an incredibly confusing experience for a young child to see the man, who's image is plastered all over their bedroom walls, taken away in handcuffs.
<P>
Even I, as an adult, was affected a few years back, when I heard that Magic Johnson was living a lifestyle that exposed him to HIV.  Events such as these affect more than just the participants - they seem to cheapen our society piece by piece.  It has gotten so bad that most parents wouldn't want their children to grow up to be President.  For our society to be at the point where the office of the Presidency isn't highly respected is a sad commentary on our country.  
<P>
NBA player Charles Barkley, who often gets into trouble on the basketball court, likes to say that he doesn't have to be a role model.  Baloney.  Being a role model is not something one chooses, but being a good role model is.  As long as we inhabit this earth, children will look up to and emulate those they see on television.  Athletes and other celebrities must just accept this responsibility along with the millions that get paid by the parents of these children.
<P>
Some athletes have accepted this responsibility.  Jim Harbaugh, quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts, always starts every interview following a victory with the words "I want to thank my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ."  This is something that my children should be respecting - a man who has succeeded in sports and still understands his priorities.  The opposite, once again is exemplified by our favorite good Samaritan, Michael Irvin.  After winning the Super Bowl, he was on national television swearing and using the f-word with frequency.   I was completely embarrassed to be watching such a disregard for common courtesy.
<P>
Parents already have a difficult task in raising their  children.  They don't need to compete with Michael Irvine and his flamboyant lifestyle. The sad thing is that Irvin and the Cowboys might just win it all again this year.  Wouldn't that be a great lesson to teach our children?

<h2>Who are the True Liberals?</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>
<P>
<BR> 
 The word is: the word "liberal" is out. It won't even
be heard at the Democrat convention. Hardly anyone will admit to
being a liberal anymore, meaning a tax-and-spend, 
guilt-manipulating, counter-cultural statist out of touch with
the regular guy. Even left-wing activists prefer the term 
"progressive."<P>
Of course, the Democrats are as liberal as ever, as we've 
come to understand the term. That is, they identify more with the 
government than with the governed. But this approach is an 
electoral loser.<P>
People believe they are being governed--taxed, regulated,
and otherwise pushed around--to death. Never in the history of
American polling has the federal government been so unpopular.
If "liberalism" is about supporting and expanding this
system, liberals will indeed have to find a new ideological cover. <p>

May they succeed! For the word liberal really belongs to those who favor the free economy and society: the sense in which the word is now used in Eastern Europe. The authentic liberal tradition, dating from the 17th century, is properly identified
with the intellectuals and popular movements who struggled against government power.<p>
Liberalism was born in Spain, when the followers of St. 
Thomas Aquinas discovered how economic freedom works to build
a prosperous society. The writings of the late-scholastics, 
centered around the School of Salamanca, bloomed into a worldwide
movement of "los liberales".<p>
In France, the liberals included A.R.J. Turgot, Jean 
Baptiste Say, and Frric Bastiat. In Britain,
Richard Cobden, John Bright, and Herbert Spencer. In Austria, Carl Menger, Eugen von Bhm-Bawerk, and Ludwig von Mises. In America, Patrick
Henry, Thomas Jefferson, and William Sumner. <p>
Liberals in this classical tradition understand the connection between welfarism and tyranny, big government and empire, central planning and poverty. Their goal is to establish the rule of law, decentralize government, and let capitalism flourish. <p>
How liberalism came to mean the opposite in this country is a twisted tale. Unlike the Old World, where being on the right meant supporting tyrannous regimes and empires, the New World was conceived in liberty. When the centralists and egalitarians began to undo this, beginning in 1861 and continuing to this day, they
purloined the name liberal for themselves. <P>
Yet even as late as the 1920s, some people who called themselves liberals had no beef with capitalism and self-government. They wanted to protect individual rights from
government power. They would never have countenanced a government
that taxed 40 cents on the dollar, promised cradle-to-grave security,
or forbad freedom of association. <p>
But the New Deal changed that. In the name of liberalism, a northeastern elite fastened a vast coercive apparatus on the country, and took us away from liberty and toward the very tyranny the constitution's framers were hoping to prevent.<p>
The term &quot;conservative&quot; didn't come into common use
for another generation. The opponents of the New Deal had no name
for themselves. They liked the name liberal, but with the term stolen
by their opponents, they resorted to cumbersome names like 
"anti-collectivist," "individualist," and
"America firster."<p>
In the post-war period, liberalism has meant consolidating 
and expanding the New Deal framework, while conservatism came
to mean fighting the Cold War, and preferring tradition to ideology. The really serious opponents of collectivism--those who favored capitalism and peace, economic freedom and civil liberties, property rights and states rights--had no name for themselves.<p>
The right term for these political views is "liberal."
But it ' s very difficult for the rightful owners of a word to take
back its meaning while their opponents are using it. After the American Revolution, for example, the centralizers adopted the term "federalists" and called their Jeffersonian opponents "anti-federalists". To this day, the meaning of "federalism"
is ideologically ambiguous. <p>
Rightly defined, liberalism is the view that society should not be centrally controlled, managed, or shaped by government.
Society manages itself, from the bottom up. Consumers, workers, investors, entrepreneurs, parents, and volunteers form 
communities of enterprise and mutual support, while the central
government is not seen, or heard, or felt. <p>
Today the American political landscape is dominated by two 
anti-liberal parties. One loves the welfare state, the other 
loves the warfare state. One wants to stamp out tobacco, the 
other would use the military in the war on drugs.  &lt;p&gt;<BR>
The fullest defense of the liberal society ever penned came 
from Ludwig von Mises in 1927 as  Liberalismus . Only this 
tradition, he said, can save civilization from Nazism, fascism,
communism, socialism, and social democracy. His warning wasn't
heeded, but when the term is reclaimed, Mises's book should be
the platform. <p>
<i>Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr., is president of the Ludwig von Mises 
Institute in Auburn, Alabama.</i><p><br>

<h2>Why the District Is Different</h2>
By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><br>
President,<br><a href="/govt-waste/home.html">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> 
 <P></center><hr>
 <P>
Many taxpayers outside the District of Columbia are saying, "Why is D.C.
getting so much attention and what's all this talk about a flat rate
federal income tax of 15 percent?" After spending nearly two decades as a
District resident and half of that time as a critical observer of
government spending, I admit bias and more than a little pride in my
response, as well as good reasons to move ahead with D.C. Delegate Eleanor
Holmes Norton's plan.
<P>
This is, after all, the nation's capitol. Instead of being the butt of
late-night talk show jokes, every patriotic American should be demanding
that the District be the crown jewel of U.S. cities, and the envy of every
world capitol.
<P>
Just try walking the nearly four-mile round trip from the Capitol to the
Washington Monument. It's safe, it's beautiful, and there's nothing like it
in any other city. Tourists marvel at the sights, and despite rumors that
make the District sound like the Wild West, they still visit in droves.
<P>
Even with its inability to address bloated and inefficient government, D.C.
is not particularly large, nor are its problems insurmountable. Bold and
decisive leadership would do the trick. But progress along these lines
still would not address a fundamental fact: The city's population is
declining rapidly. In the first five years of the 1990s, the population
dropped as much as it did in the entire decade from 1980 to 1990. And many
of those leaving were African-American and middle class.
<P>
The Norton plan is simple -- lure people back into the District by lowering
federal taxes. Support for the bill includes House Speaker Newt Gingrich
(R-Ga.), Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) and Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott (R-Miss.). Bipartisan companion legislation has been introduced
in the Senate by Democrat Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and Senate Joint
Economic Committee Chairman Connie Mack (R-Fla.). Members of the Maryland
and Virginia delegations are also supportive: Rep. Roscoe Bartlett (R-Md.)
said it could help the entire region become more prosperous, and Rep. Tom
Davis (R-Va.) is moving forward quickly with hearings before his House
Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee on the District of Columbia.
<P>
The opposition to the proposal comes from the traditional proponents of
class warfare (the plan benefits the rich more than the poor), and people
in other cities who want the same deal. House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Bill Archer, seeking a more comprehensive tax reform plan, is not
yet in favor of the Norton bill.
<P>
But Washington is different, and it's well worth the projected annual $700
million in lost revenue to the Treasury. We only need to look at a small
portion of the $160 billion in annual federal spending that my organization
-- Citizens Against Government Waste -- identifies as wasteful spending to
find the necessary offsets.
<P>
For example, Congress could eliminate the Market Access Program ($90
million), the Economic Development Administration ($348 million), the
Advanced Technology Program ($300 million), the Appalachian Regional
Commission ($140 million), and the Strategic Petroleum Reserves ($109
million) and the National Biological Survey ($115 million). These
half-dozen programs total $1.1 billion, more than enough to meet the cost
of this new program.
<P>
The issue is not finding the savings, it's convincing skeptics on Capitol
Hill that it's OK to lose control over hundreds of millions of dollars and
that people in D.C. and people who would want to live in the District --
nearly two-thirds of whom are African-American -- really will know how to
spend the money they save from the tax cut.
<P>
The class warfare argument is specious: Individual taxpayers making $15,000
or less; single head of households at $25,000 or less, and joint filers at
$30,000 or less will pay NO federal tax. That means more than half of D.C.
taxpayers will simply be taken off the rolls. Is there any more direct
manner in which to help and reward hardworking lower income people than to
strengthen their ties to their community?
<P>
For those who continue to pay taxes, but at lower rates, the potential for
creating or expanding business is phenomenal. There are 31,000 sole
proprietorships in the District, meaning they pay the individual income tax
rate. Assuming that a tax of $28,000 (28 percent) on business income of
$100,000 would be reduced to $15,000, that $13,000 would no longer be
diffused throughout the national economy, but would be largely directed at
local spending and investment. The resulting savings is enough to hire a
full-time employee, purchase new equipment, or retire outstanding debt that
will lead to additional business opportunities.
<P>
The kicker in the tax reduction scheme is the elimination of capital gains
taxes for investments in D.C. by District residents. So what would a
<P>
logical person do with their savings? Invest it in local businesses.
<P>
That's what I plan to do -- in fact, I pledge that one-third of the savings
I will obtain from lower taxes will be invested in D.C. businesses, either
directly, or through market opportunities. If every D.C. taxpayer followed
this lead, there would be approximately $233 million (assuming one-third of
the $700 million in revenue lost to the federal government) available for
investment in D.C. Or, if only the richest taxpayers (1994 figures) -- the
4,396 whose income exceeds $200,000 and who paid $600 million, or 35.2
percent of D.C.'s $1.7 billion in taxes -- did the same, there would still
be more than $82 million for city business. Or take the 15,313 returns for
people making more than $100,000 annually. They paid $900 million, or 52.9
percent of 1994 taxes, meaning if they pledged one-third of their savings,
there would be more than $123 million to increase the city's employment and
business base.
<P>
Best of all, that money would not flow through the inefficient hands of the
federal bureaucracy, and it would remain where people know best how to use
it. With what's left over, charitable Washingtonians could support local
nonprofits, the arts, schools, and religion, all of which will be more
direct help to the needy than the federal or local government could ever
provide. And let's not forget what it would mean for this city to have
people wanting to move in, rather than out, of the District. Beyond the
obvious greater tax base, we would enhance the support of institutions that
are key to long-term urban health -- our neighborhoods and our schools.
<P>
All of this may be too logical for the bean counters and those ready to
write off the city's future. But most Americans have a vision of our
nation's Capitol that is rooted in the past and looking to tomorrow. The
Norton plan is the best way to get us all on this hopeful path.
<P>

<h2>            
Feminist Assault On Reasonableness
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
                    


     Now that women are attending law schools in greater numbers,
     feminists are turning up as law school professors, law review
     writers, state legislators, congressional staffers, prosecutors,
     law clerks, and even judges. The result is ominous for basic
     concepts of American law and justice, and an excellent policy
     analysis on "feminist jurisprudence" by the Cato Institute
     explains why.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The feminist goal is not fair treatment for women, but the
     redistribution of power from the "dominant class" (the male
     patriarchal system) to the "subordinate" class (nominally women,
     but actually only the feminists who know how to play by rules
     they have invented). They even want to establish a license for
     women to kill their allegedly abusive spouses.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     They have peddled the fiction that men are engaged in a vast
     conspiracy against women, that something like 85 percent of
     employed women are sexually harassed in the workplace, and that
     something on the order of 50 to 70 percent of wives are beaten by
     their husbands. They want to establish the rule that offenses
     against women should be defined (not objectively, but
     subjectively) on the basis of how the woman felt instead of what
     the defendant did.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Before the feminist movement burst on the scene in the 1970s,
     there were literally hundreds of laws that gave advantages or
     protections to women based on society's common sense recognition
     of the facts of life and human nature. These included the
     prohibition against statutory rape, the Mann Act, the obligation
     of the husband to support his wife and provide her with a home,
     special protections for widows (e.g., one state gave widows a
     little property tax exemption, another prescribed triple
     penalties against anyone who cheated a widow), and laws that made
     it a misdemeanor to use obscene or profane language in the
     presence of a woman.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The premier feminist lawyer in the 1970s, Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
     argued that all such differences of treatment based on gender
     were sex discriminatory and, therefore, should be abolished. She
     won several Supreme Court cases on that theory, and, in state
     after state as well as in Congress, feminist lawyers persuaded
     legislators to gender-neutralize their laws.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In theory, Ginsburg appeared to demand a doctrinaire equality,
     opposing the Mann Act because it "was meant to protect weak women
     from bad men" and that was demeaning to women. But in practice,
     she demanded affirmative action for women even in the military.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Now the feminists don't even pay lip service to a gender equality
     goal. They have launched a broadside attack on such basic
     precepts as equality under the law, judicial neutrality, a
     defendant is innocent until proven guilty, conviction requires
     proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and guilt or liability should be
     judged according to the traditional "reasonable man" theory.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Female plaintiffs had always been able to sue for unwanted sexual
     overtures in the workplace by using the common-law remedies of
     tort and contract. Feminists reject this remedy because they want
     sexual harassment cases to be based on the notion of a male
     conspiracy to victimize women and that a "hostile work
     environment" is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by Title
     VII of the Civil Rights Act.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The Supreme Court adopted this feminist theory in the 1986 case
     of Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, where the Court even went so
     far as to say that "'voluntariness' in the sense of consent" is
     not a defense. These notions had been invented by Michigan Law
     School professor Catharine MacKinnon, who was reported to have
     boasted, "What the decision means is that we made this law up
     from the beginning, and now we've won."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     A 1991 Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision replaced the
     common-law "reasonable man" standard with a "reasonable woman"
     test, embracing the feminist notion that men and women can't see
     the same events in the same way. The court declared that the old
     common-law standard "systematically ignores the experiences of
     women."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Now the feminists are demanding the "unreasonable woman" rule.
     The feminists want the victim rather than the law to define the
     offense.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In a 1991 Jacksonville, Florida case, a federal district court
     found an employer guilty of a "hostile work environment" even
     though there was no evidence of sexual language or demands
     directed at the plaintiff who claimed she felt sexually harassed.
     The other female workers said they did not feel sexually
     harassed, but the judge said that merely provided "additional
     evidence of victimization."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The feminists are actively promoting college speech codes to
     prohibit what they call discriminatory or harassing speech. They
     argue that it's just as actionable for a man to call a woman
     "honey" or "baby" as to call her a "bitch"; and, of course, jokes
     are not allowed. Nearly 400 colleges and universities have these
     anti-First Amendment speech regulations, about a third of which
     target mere "advocacy of offensive or outrageous viewpoints or
     biased ideas."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The feminists want the battered woman syndrome to free any woman
     from conviction of violent crime. The feminists are even pushing
     the Catharine MacKinnon notion that all heterosexual sex is rape
     unless an affirmative, sober, explicit verbal consent can be
     proven.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     They want the action of a battered woman who kills her husband to
     be considered as normal, and that killing a man in his sleep can
     be called self-defense.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     More lawyers, scholars and academics are badly needed to speak up
     and expose the feminist foolishness for what it is: a scurrilous
     attack on our Bill of Rights.

<H2>GUATEMALA Y SU BUROCRACIA</H2>
<p>
Manuel F. Ayau*
<p>
CIUDAD DE GUATEMALA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Cada da estamos ms a la cola en las listas de
pases segn su riqueza y (ser coincidencia?) tambin entre las naciones
que gozan de menos libertad.  Aqu el ciudadano no es libre de hacer nada
por derecho, pues todo requiere una ley que permite que algn brillante
funcionario del gobierno le d licencia o autorizacin.  El dictador no
tiene nombre y apellido; es el funcionario que sabe mejor que Ud. cmo
manejar su negocio.
<p>
Lo primero que debemos reconocer es que la pobreza es culpa
nuestra y slo la podemos curar desde adentro. Las ddivas del exterior que
tanto nos gustan solamente son unas gotas que ms bien sirven de soporfero
humillante y que contribuyen a agrandar la brecha entre los pases ricos y
nosotros porque nos da una falsa esperanza que pospone tomar las medidas
correctas. Y esa ayuda casi siempre viene acompaada de consejos
equivocados, pues los dispensadores de ddivas, debido a la misma filosofa
que los califica para su trabajo, tienen una visin poco realista del mundo
real.
<p> 
La preocupacin por la brecha entre ricos y pobres es uno de
los factores que no permiten eliminar la miseria porque cuando la riqueza
del pas aumenta, los pobres son menos pobres, pero los ricos son ms ricos.
Tenemos entonces que escoger qu es lo que queremos lograr: eliminar la
pobreza o eliminar las diferencias entre pobres y ricos?
<p>
Volando sobre la capital y observando cmo se ha rodeado de
cinturones de pobreza, me pregunto, cunta gente viene del interior porque
no hay telfonos y por ello no se establecen empresas ni se crean empleos.
Esos cinturones son parte del precio de haber prohibido que cualquiera
pudiera competir en el negocio telefnico en nuestra paternalista Guatemala.  
<p>
Nos tom muchos aos aprender que una tasa de cambio
artificial causaba crisis y, en consecuencia, retrocedimos una dcada.
Despus nos ha costado mucho aprender que haber elevado las tasas de inters
a niveles estratosfricos produce recesin. Cada vez que probamos una
"brillante" poltica incurrimos en el carsimo proceso de aprendizaje.
<p>
La prxima brillante idea es la de privatizar "con creatividad". En vez de simplemente
privatizar, es decir, proceder a vender por subasta pblica internacional las empresas
estatales y dejarlas que operen libremente bajo las leyes generales del pas, ya se
estn inventando ingeniosos modelos, avalados por "brillantes" asesores extranjeros
("empresarios" en recomendar polticas) para que el gobierno dirija la
industria elctrica, d concesiones, otorgue licencias, fije precios, etc.
Todo para que las empresas privadas "no hagan cosas inconvenientes".
Adems, se bautiz a los nuevos ministerios con otros nombres, como
Superintendencia de Comunicaciones o la Comisin Nacional de Electricidad.
Estos pequeos nuevos ministerios, al cabo de los aos, tendrn su propio
edificio, donde se puedan hacer trmites engorrosos. As mismo nacieron el
Inde, Guatel, Minera, Hidrocarburos y tantas otras superintendencias y
comisiones que nos han empobrecido, impidiendo el progreso nacional.  
<p>
La Corte de Constitucionalidad anul la Constitucin y nos
inform que Guatel no es un monopolio telefnico aunque est prohibido
competir con l. Tambin nos dijo que los precios de la energa se pueden
interferir por razones ideolgicas, aunque no cubran costos. Y el nuevo
proyecto de ley elctrica mantiene que los precios de la energa son libres,
siempre que no se usen las calles para distribuirla. Brillante!
Evidentemente seguiremos pobres porque en Guatemala seguimos confundiendo un
rgimen de legalidad con uno de derecho.

<H2>CHILE EN LAS GRANDES LIGAS</H2>
<p>
Carlos A. Ball*
<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Cuando en Amrica Latina hablbamos de empresas
multinacionales nos referamos a compaas como la Standard Oil, United
Fruit, US Steel o Anaconda. Esas han cambiado sus nombres, han perdido
importancia o fueron nacionalizadas durante nuestra mala racha de socialismo
nacionalista. Pero lo interesante es que hoy varias de las ms vigorosas
multinacionales, en plena expansin en pases como Argentina, Per y Brasil,
son empresas de capital chileno que hasta hace menos de una dcada eran
comatosas empresas estatales, con exceso de personal y que adems de dar
psimo servicio producan inmensas prdidas.
<p>
 Una de estas nuevas multinacionales, Enersis S.A., a fines de noviembre
coloc exitosamente, a travs de J. P. Morgan, Merril Lynch y Salomon
Brothers, $800 millones en bonos con vencimiento en los aos 2006, 2016 y
2026. Parte de esos fondos irn a Brasil, donde Enersis -en asociacin con
empresas elctricas de Espaa y Portugal- acaba de ganar la licitacin para
adquirir por $588 millones el 70% de la Compaa Elctrica de Ro de
Janeiro, una empresa estatal que durante los primeros nueve meses de este
ao logr perder $122 millones.
<p>
 Segn el Wall Street Journal, Enersis hoy en da controla empresas con
valor de mercado por unos $13.000 millones, habindose logrado convertir en
una de las favoritas de los inversionistas institucionales especializados en
mercados emergentes.
<p>
 Jos Yuraszeck, el presidente de 45 aos de Enersis S.A., era a principios
de los aos 70 uno de los valientes jvenes estudiantes que manifestaban su
oposicin al rgimen socialista de Salvador Allende. Luego del golpe
militar, el gobierno de Pinochet le asign la misin de desmantelar el
control estatal en la empresa elctrica de Santiago, Chilectra Metropolitana.
<p>
 Chilectra fue privatizada en 1987 y Yuraszeck logr convertirse en su
administrador con el apoyo de fondos de pensin privados y de los empleados
que adquirieron acciones de la empresa. Poco despus repetira la misma
estrategia para comprar la Empresa Nacional de Electricidad (Endesa), la ms
grande  generadora de energa elctrica en Chile. Bajo la visionaria
gerencia de Jos Yuraszeck, la capitalizacin de Enersis, la empresa matriz
duea tanto de Chilectra como Endesa, se ha multiplicado 57 veces desde
1988, hasta alcanzar unos $4.000 millones en la actualidad. 
<p>
 Su primera inversin extranjera la realiz el grupo en 1992, en la
Argentina, al adquirir el control de Edesur S.A., una de las empresas
distribuidoras de electricidad en Buenos Aires, a la vez que dos grandes
empresas generadoras: Central Costanera S.A. y El Chocn. En 1994, el grupo
Enersis hara lo mismo en Lima, al adquirir una importante participacin en
la empresa ms grande de energa elctrica del Per. El xito de Enersis en
el extranjero se basa en reducir drsticamente el robo de electricidad y
cambiar el tradicional letargo burocrtico de las empresas estatales de
energa por una vibrante cultura empresarial.
<p>
 Adems de una inversin inicial de $490 millones para la adquisicin de
Edesur, Enersis invirti otros $340 millones en modernizar las
instalaciones, convirtiendo a 360.000 personas que se aprovechaban de
energa gratuita en clientes de la empresa. Edesur pas de perder $62
millones en 1993 a producir utilidades por $59,5 millones el ao pasado.
<p>
 Enersis piensa repetir la misma historia con la Compaa de Electricidad de
Ro de Janeiro, la cual da servicio a 1,2 millones de clientes. El potencial
de crecimiento en el Brasil es inmenso.
<p>
 De todo esto, la primera leccin es que la produccin y distribucin de
energa elctrica nada tiene que ver con "soberana" ni con industrias
"bsicas y estratgicas reservadas al estado" sino, ms bien, con eficiencia
y productividad. La segunda es que hay amplio financiamiento privado en
respaldo de empresas exitosas y empresarios visionarios. Y la tercera es que
hombres como Yuraszeck los hay tambin en pases como Cuba y Venezuela, slo
que la falta de libertad bajo el socialismo los aplasta.

<H2>INFLACION: LA ESPECIALIDAD DE LA CASA</H2>
<p>
Alvaro Bardn*
<p>
SANTIAGO DE CHILE (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El nuevo presidente del Banco Central de Chile,
Carlos Massad, entreg recientemente unas cifras sobre la inflacin que
conviene consignar. Sostuvo que desde mediados de los aos 30 hasta la fecha
el nivel de precios se multiplic por un factor de 85 millones, de manera
tal que si alguien hubiera guardado o ahorrado en 1936 mil millones de
pesos, tendra hoy solamente once pesos. Naturalmente, la gente no es
estpida y para evitar en parte el robo inflacionario disminuy su demanda
de pesos y se fue a dlares, al ahorro en bienes durables y materias primas
y desde hace unos 30 aos al ahorro en ttulos reajustables, cuando el
gobierno lo permiti y lo legisl.
<p>
 En el intervalo Chile vivi en huelgas porque los trabajadores, con razn,
pedan reajustes de sus remuneraciones nominales.  Los jubilados, que no
podan hacer protestas efectivas, vean que sus pensiones se desvanecan y
todos los chilenos descubrieron, primero a fines de los 50 y luego a
mediados de los 70, que sus fondos previsionales haban desaparecido y que
las solidarias cajas estatales estaban en quiebra. No slo por la
inflacin-robo sino por mala administracin. En Chile, como se sabe,
cambiamos al sistema privado de pensiones y los fondos estn mejor
invertidos en ttulos reajustables, acciones y una amplia gama de valores en
moneda nacional y extranjera. Dems est decir que la inflacin derrib
varios gobiernos, mediante elecciones, y, por la fuerza a Salvador Allende,
en 1973, cuando el aumento de precios lleg a 1000% y la hiperinflacin nos
aplastaba.
<p>
 En 1996 la inflacin fue de 6,5% y en 1997 ser segn Massad, de 5,5%.
Asegura, adems, que hacia fines del siglo Chile tendr una inflacin como
la de los pases industrializados. Sin embargo, no ser fcil porque la
voracidad del gobierno chileno se est pareciendo a la del pasado. Su gasto
ha crecido al 7% real desde 1990 y en 1996 y 1997 se acerca peligrosamente a
los dos dgitos. El fisco mantiene supervit y ahorra porque los ingresos
tributarios han subido por el rpido crecimiento de la economa y por alzas
en impuestos como el IVA, a la renta y otros especficos. Pero el mayor
gasto estatal presiona la demanda interna y con ello la inflacin. 
El Banco Central  se hace cmplice de este mayor gasto manteniendo altas las
tasas de inters y limitando los crditos externos de corto plazo con otro
impuesto que denomina encaje. As se reprime el gasto privado en consumo e
inversin y se le hace espacio al estado para que siga despilfarrando el
dinero de todos en ineficiencia productiva, reajustes a empleados pblicos
que trabajan poco, fomentos intiles y un gasto social enorme que no ha
mejorado los servicios educacionales ni de salud y, se estima, que en ms de
un 60% va a parar a los bolsillos de los que no se clasifican como pobres.
Estos pagan impuestos, como todos, y reciben a cambio algo de lo que queda
despus de las filtraciones a otros sectores y del pago de una frondosa
burocracia.
<p>
 Como es natural, esta poltica terminar por perjudicar la tasa de
crecimiento de la economa chilena y del empleo que ayuda a los pobres
directamente. Esto ya se observa pero se le da poca importancia. Incluso el
premio Nobel Robert Lucas, de visita en el pas, sostuvo que con el vuelo
que agarr la economa chilena con los pasados cambios estructurales poda
seguir creciendo bien un buen rato. Yo, por el contrario, pienso que si no
se corrige la tendencia al alza del gasto pblico, la economa perder
dinamismo y le costar mucho alcanzar las tasas de inflacin de los pases
ms avanzados.

<H2>GANGSTERISMO POLITICO EN VENEZUELA</H2>
<p>
Hctor Betancourt*
<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- En la Venezuela actual, polticos poderosos utilizan a
policas y a jueces para despojar a ciudadanos de sus propiedades. Y no me
refiero a hechos aislados en remotas poblaciones del interior sino a lo que
me est sucediendo a mi, en mi hacienda El Encantado, la mayor extensin de
terreno privado, todava sin desarrollar, en el valle de Caracas.
<p>
 Durante doce aos, el diputado suplente al Congreso Nacional Alejandro
Kaufman ha utilizado el contrato que tiene de administracin del Cementerio
del Este para irse apoderando de los terrenos municipales que rodean al
cementerio, procediendo luego a desplazar linderos, tumbar cercas de los
vecinos y a enterrar muertos en terrenos ajenos. Cuando los propietarios se
vienen a dar cuenta, ya tienen varios cientos de muertos enterrados en sus
tierras, con todas las complicaciones humanas y legales que ello implica.
<p>
 En 1994, el diputado Kaufman se adue fraudulentamente de 100 mil metros
cuadrados de terrenos municipales en complicidad con la Oficina de Registro
del 5 Circuito. Esto fue denunciado al ayuntamiento y al gobierno central,
sin que las autoridades reaccionaran. A mi y a otros propietarios nos
preocupaba porque sabamos que una vez que se adueara de los terrenos
municipales colindantes, Kaufman procedera a invadir y a tratar de
despojarnos de nuestras propiedades, como en efecto ahora est sucediendo.
Kaufman es un personaje que se jacta pblicamente de no tener abogados a su
servicio sino a jueces. Armado de un oficio emitido por la Ingeniera
Municipal que ilegalmente determina que los caminos privados de mi hacienda
son de uso pblico, introduce tractores a mi propiedad para derribar cercas
y portones, respaldado con policas municipales y agentes de la Disip, la
polica poltica, de cuyo director es compadre. Durante la noche y por
varias horas, disparan contra mi casa, donde vivo con mi madre, esposa y
pequeos hijos, para tratar de amedrentarnos y que accedamos a dejarnos
robar. Tambin mantiene intervenidas mis lneas telefnicas y vigila todos
mis movimientos.
<p>
 Parte del problema se debe a la corrupcin rampante en los registros de
propiedad venezolanos. Con unos ttulos de propiedad falsos que incluyen 80
hectreas de mi hacienda, una empresa pirata consigui en 1986 un crdito
por $5 millones en el Banco Industrial, propiedad del estado. Esta hipoteca
fue luego traspasada al Banco Provincial, el banco ms grande del pas. A
pesar que le informamos a la Oficina de Registro y al propio banco que se
trataba de ttulos falsos, en base a la misma hipoteca le aumentaron el
crdito a ms de $20 millones. Cuando la empresa involucrada no pudo pagar
la deuda, el Banco Provincial ejecut la hipoteca y vendi los terrenos el
16 de agosto de este ao a Kaufman por slo $425.000, absorbiendo una
cuantiosa prdida, pero dejando constancia en el documento de venta que no
se responsabiliza del saneamiento de la propiedad. Cmo logra el Banco
Provincial registrar el traspaso de la propiedad cuando los documentos que
tiene son falsos? Pienso que la nica explicacin es que la esposa del
presidente del Banco Provincial es la directora nacional de los registros de
propiedad.
<p>
Cuando denunci estos hechos a la prensa venezolana, la respuesta del
diputado Kaufman fue ingresar a mi hacienda, la noche del 23 de septiembre,
acompaado de 20 hombres, entre ellos policas municipales y agentes de la
Disip uniformados, portando armas de guerra. Kaufman me agredi fsicamente,
rompindome a golpes cuatro costillas, mientras sus secuaces me sujetaban,
todo esto en presencia de mi abogado y del gerente de mi hacienda.
Esa noche ingres a la emergencia de la Clnica Metropolitana de Caracas y
con el informe mdico y las radiografas hice la denuncia ante la Polica
Tcnica Judicial al da siguiente, siendo examinado por funcionarios de la
medicatura forense. Seguidamente, el diputado Kaufman logra que mi denuncia
sea pasada a la jurisdiccin de la juez Mari Carmen La Riva Ron, quien me
llam a declarar y tambin a los mdicos forenses que haban elaborado el
informe. Ellos dijeron -bajo alguna presin- que sus firmas haban sido
falsificadas. La juez, entonces, procedi a emitir el 16 de diciembre una
orden de arresto en mi contra por calumnia agravada y por forjamiento de
documentos.
<p>
 Quien haya ledo el reportaje sobre las crceles de Caracas aparecido en la
primera pgina del Miami Herald el domingo 22 de diciembre, bajo el ttulo
de "Infierno en la Tierra", sabe que nadie en su sano juicio se entrega en
Venezuela y mucho menos durante vacaciones judiciales, cuando los ciudadanos
quedamos totalmente desamparados. Por ello me vi obligado a fugarme en una
avioneta a una isla del Caribe y de all me vine a Florida. Una vez
concluidas las festividades de ao nuevo, tengo todas las intenciones de
seguir en mi lucha por conservar intacta la propiedad que hered de mi padre.
<p>
 Comprendo que el sector poltico venezolano me considera una anomala. En
mi pas, quienes no tenemos padrinos polticos no estamos supuestos a
enfrentarnos a los poderosos sino a negociar con ellos, de manera que lo que
nos quitan sea compensado con alguno de los privilegios que polticos y
funcionarios graciosamente estn en capacidad de asignar. Yo no estoy
dispuesto a convertirme en cmplice del gangsterismo poltico venezolano y
tengo la intencin de dejarle a mis hijos la misma herencia limpia que
recib de mi padre.

<H2>PROPIEDAD PRIVADA Y DESARROLLO SOSTENIBLE</H2>
<p>
Julian Morris*
<p>
SANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA, BOLIVIA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Despus de la II Guerra Mundial,
polticos y  economistas se obsesionaron con el tema del desarrollo
econmico. Las naciones fueron clasificadas segn su producto per capita;
aquellas con un producto per capita mayor se designaron "desarrolladas" y
las dems "subdesarrolladas". Instituciones multilaterales como el Banco
Mundial y el FMI que se haban creado para revivir a Europa devastada por la
guerra, pronto se dedicaron a una nueva misin: fomentar el desarrollo
econmico en los pases atrasados. Miles de millones de dlares se gastaron
en proyectos que supuestamente lograran alcanzar la meta del desarrollo.
<p>
 Lamentablemente, los planes simplistas de polticos y burcratas
infrecuentemente alcanzan sus magnnimos propsitos. As sucedi, en parte
porque el dinero lo prestaron a gobiernos que sufren de corrupcin endmica
(se estima que la riqueza personal del presidente Mobutu es igual a la deuda
nacional de Zaire) y tambin porque los proyectos fueron mal concebidos. Por
ejemplo, inmensas obras hidroelctricas benefician a empresas de aluminio
pero poco hacen por eliminar la pobreza entre campesinos que viven en
tierras ridas.
<p>
 En los aos 80 comenz a surgir la preocupacin de que estos proyectos
grandiosos tenan un impacto negativo en el medio ambiente, especialmente
las represas que inundan la selva y obras de riego que salinizan las
tierras. Entonces, el primer ministro noruego, Gro Harlem Brundtland,
invent el trmino "desarrollo sostenible", reconociendo que el desarrollo
industrial no es en s mismo algo positivo, sino que debe lograrse dentro de
un marco legal que proteja el derecho de individuos a no ser perjudicados,
tanto ahora como en el futuro.
<p>
 En la compleja sociedad moderna, la mejor manera de asegurarse que el
desarrollo se lleve a cabo de manera sostenible es descentralizando lo ms
posible el poder de decisin. Esto conlleva a responsabilizar a individuos
por conservar los recursos naturales. Cuando una persona es duea de un
recurso tiene  la motivacin para conservarlo porque sabe que se beneficiar
de l maana, el ao que viene, dentro de una dcada y sus herederos dentro
de un siglo. Cuando los polticos controlan los recursos tienen un menor
incentivo de conservarlo porque su principal inters es ser reelecto.
<p>
 Un reciente estudio de Alex James de Cambridge University encontr que las
inversiones en reservas de animales depende de quien las administra. La
menor inversin se hace en las reservas que son administradas y que
pertenecen al estado; algo ms en las reservas que son del estado pero
administradas independientemente y la inversin es mucho mayor en aquellas
que pertenecen y son administradas por el sector privado.
<p>
 Otra condicin necesaria para el desarrollo sostenible es que los
individuos puedan intercambiar (vender) los derechos de propiedad. Es
deseable que cada recurso se utilice de la manera ms eficiente y ello slo
ocurre cuando cada recurso es utilizado por el individuo que lo valora ms,
para lo cual es necesario que se pueda traspasar libremente la propiedad.
<p>
 Tanto las naciones industrializadas como las naciones en desarrollo
comienzan a darse cuenta que las regulaciones ambientales son a menudo
exageradamente costosas. Adems, muchas regulaciones tienen consecuencias
dainas al medio ambiente. Un ejemplo clsico ocurri en Bolivia, donde se
prohibi la tala de ciertos rboles. Tan pronto la gente se enter de que
iba a salir el decreto, se cortaron muchsimos de esos rboles.
<p>
 Es ms efectivo el cuido del ambiente cuando se les permite a individuos
hacerlo. En Inglaterra, los pescadores han protegido a los ros de la
contaminacin demandando a industrias que los ensuciaban. Lamentablemente,
las regulaciones que estipulan un mximo de emisiones contaminantes de hecho
le dan a las industrias el derecho de contaminar hasta ese lmite. Si vamos
a avanzar hacia el desarrollo sostenible debemos revisar las bases en que se
fundamenta la regulacin ambiental.

<H2>LAS CUENTAS DEL GRAN CAPITAN</H2>

<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Las "Cuentas del Gran Capitn" son definidas por
el Diccionario de la Lengua Espaola como aquellas cuentas "exorbitantes y
formadas arbitrariamente y sin  justificacin". Algunos autores refieren que
el Gran Capitn Gonzalo de Crdoba present partidas de descargo ante el Rey
de Npoles, que venan a ser as:  "200.736 ducados y 9 reales para frailes,
monjas y pobres que rueguen a Dios por la prosperidad de las armas
espaolas; 100 millones en picos, palas y azadones; 100.000 ducados en
plvora y balas; 10.000 ducados en guantes perfumados para preservar del mal
olor de los cadveres de los enemigos tendidos en el campo de batalla;
170.000 ducados en poner y renovar campanas destruidas con el uso continuo
de repicar por nuevas victorias conseguidas sobre el enemigo; 50.000 ducados

al Todopoderoso; tres millones de sufragios por los muertos; 700.492 ducados
en espas y cien millones por mi paciencia en escuchar que el Rey peda
cuentas al que le ha regalado un reino".
<p>
 Cualquier semejanza de las cuentas anteriores con la campaa
presidencial mexicana en 1994 y en especial con los gastos electorales en la
ltima eleccin de gobernador en el Estado de Tabasco es pura coincidencia.
Como se ve, este asunto de las cuentas alegres es un recurso muy viejo y
desgastado. 
<p>
La nica innovacin que se advierte en la vetusta tecnologa del maquillaje
de las cifras oficiales es que en Mxico las Cuentas del Gran Capitn se
fabrican con anticipacin a las batallas electorales, como ocurre ahora ante
las cruciales elecciones de 1997, en que estarn en juego la renovacin
total de la Cmara de Diputados, parcial de la Cmara de Senadores, seis
gobernaciones estatales y la sede del Gran Capitn, la gran Ciudad de Mxico.
<p>
 Veamos un caso ejemplar de la tecnologa local en el manejo
de cifras: la milagrosa recuperacin de las reservas internacionales del
pas, proeza casi comparable con nuestra eficacia para perderlas en un
santiamn, en 1994. 
<p>
 Las Cuentas del Gran Capitn Don Miguel Mancera, presidente
del Banco de Mxico, son ms o menos las siguientes: Reservas
Internacionales al cierre: $17.509 millones, $1.768 millones ms que en
1995. Magnfico! Sin embargo, los $5.829 millones de activos netos no toman
en cuenta los pasivos con el Fondo Monetario Internacional por ms de
$13.260 millones. As, las presuntas reservas desaparecen y la falsedad de
las Cuentas del Gran Capitn queda en plena evidencia. Respaldar al Peso con
deuda externa (FMI) no es sano ni correcto ni ha sido una defensa efectiva
contra los ataques especulativos. Siempre terminamos ms endeudados.
<p>
 El artificio de convertir prstamos en reservas, como un
engao preelectoral no tendra mayor efecto si por el otro lado no
estuvieran aumentando la circulacin de dinero sin respaldo. En septiembre,
la Base Monetaria andaba en 47.806 millones de pesos y a finales de
diciembre estaba en 87.434 millones, un espectacular 83% de aumento. Por lo
menos necesitamos $11.000 millones propios, no prestados,  para darle un
respaldo  firme a los Pesos que andan circulando hoy en da. 
<p>
 Las Cuentas del Gran Capitn en las que el gobierno est
apostando para conservar la mayora de Congreso deben exhibirse, porque
constituye un engao premeditado con fines polticoelectorales. Ni la
fantasiosa macroeconoma est tan bien (ah vienen todos los dficits!) ni
mucho  menos ha mejorado la microeconoma real de los bolsillos y la boca de
los mexicanos. Arriesgar nuevamente al pas a una crisis recurrente mediante
gasto pblico, inflacin monetaria, ms impuestos y subsidios no slo pone
en evidencia esa incapacidad tcnica para gobernar que debe pronto terminar,
sino la inmoralidad de hacer poltica bajo la premisa de que el fin
justifica los medios.

<H2>GLOBALIZACION DE LA ECONOMIA</H2>
<p>
Luis Pazos*
<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Hace poco una periodista me present en Panam
como  partidario de la globalizacin. Es frecuente que cuando explicamos un
fenmeno econmico, que se da independientemente de que estemos de acuerdo
con l o no, inmediatamente nos adjudican etiquetas. Lo importante para
muchos intelectuales no es explicar el fenmeno sino ubicarlo dentro de
ciertas tendencias y con base en ello aplaudirlo o criticarlo. Esa actitud
es tan absurda como acusar de partidario de las tormentas a aquel que
explica porqu llueve.
<p>
 La globalizacin no es una moda ni corresponde a un esquema neoliberal; es
producto del avance tecnolgico, fruto de las innovaciones y descubrimientos
del siglo XX.
<p>
 Bajo el trmino globalizacin entendemos el intercambio generalizado de
bienes y servicios entre pases y continentes. Hace siglos, cuando el
principal transporte era el burro o el caballo, el comercio no poda llegar
ms all de unos cuantos kilmetros a la redonda; ahora que un avin recorre
en menos de un da los puntos ms distantes del planeta tambin las
mercancas lo pueden hacer. El fax, la comunicacin va satlite, el correo
electrnico y la transferencia de fondos en unos segundos de un punto de la
tierra a otro son instrumentos que han propiciado la globalizacin de la
economa.
<p>
 Ante las tormentas y la lluvia no es relevante ser de derecha o de
izquierda, sino salir con gabardina y paraguas. Ante la globalizacin, no se
trata de estar a favor o en contra, sino de prepararse para operar
eficientemente bajo esa nueva circunstancia. Si ignoramos la lluvia, nos
mojamos. Y si como profesionales, empresarios o nacin pasamos por la alto
la globalizacin, nos quedaremos atrasados, empobrecidos y seremos desplazados.
<p>
 Desde el punto de vista profesional, la globalizacin implica un esfuerzo
adicional  para capacitarse y conocer los adelantos tecnolgicos referentes
a nuestra especialidad, no tan slo en nuestra ciudad sino de todas partes.
Como empresario es necesario identificar las tcnicas que usan no slo
nuestros competidores de la misma regin, sino de todo el mundo, con quienes
tarde o temprano estaremos compitiendo tambin. Como gobernante y poltico
significa tener en cuenta que las leyes fiscales, laborales, ecolgicas,
comerciales, industriales, etc. sern comparadas y evaluadas con respecto a
las de otros pases, y seleccionando entre las naciones que brinden mejores
condiciones los inversionistas decidirn dnde invertirn, crear empresas,
empleos y, por lo tanto, mejores niveles de vida.
<p>
 La globalizacin es la internacionalizacin de las actividades econmicas
debido a la reduccin de las distancias, de los tiempos y la simultaneidad
de la informacin a nivel mundial. No es una moda, sino un fenmeno producto
de la tecnologa en las postrimeras del siglo XX.

<H2>EL TAMAO DEL BUEN GOBIERNO</H2>
<p>
Richard Rahn*
<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El presidente Clinton declar que haba terminado la era
del gobierno grande. Como los republicanos llevan aos argumentando que el
gobierno es demasiado grande, parece que ambos partidos ahora se pondrn de
acuerdo en reducirlo. La pregunta es cunto.
<p>
 La respuesta corta es que el gobierno debe ser entre 60% y 80% de su tamao
actual para maximizar el crecimiento econmico y el bienestar social. Las
propuestas presupuestarias de ambos partidos reconocen que el gobierno ha
crecido por encima de su tamao ptimo, pero ninguno de los dos partidos ha
hecho propuestas sobre cmo reducirlo hasta alcanzar ese tamao ptimo.
<p>
 Con el propsito de determinar ms exactamente el tamao ptimo de los
gobiernos, recientemente complet un estudio con los profesores Harrison y
Linn Fox, patrocinado por la Fundacin Krieble, que analiza la relacin
entre crecimiento econmico y el tamao del gobierno central en 57 pases,
desde 1951 hasta 1993. Incluimos todas las naciones que cuentan con
estadsticas razonablemente confiables y cuyo Producto Interno Bruto era de
ms de $5.000 millones, sin incluir aquellos cuya economa depende de
exportaciones petroleras. Utilizamos slo datos de los gobiernos centrales
porque los regionales y locales no son muy confiables en muchos pases.
<p>
 Debido a que los gobiernos locales gastan entre 5% y 15% del PIB, nuestros
resultados subestiman el tamao verdadero de los gobiernos. Por ejemplo, el
gobierno federal de Estados Unidos gast en 1996 21% del PIB, mientras que
los gobiernos locales gastaron 12%, para un total de 33%
<p>
 Encontramos que se maximiza el crecimiento econmico cuando los gastos del
gobierno central alcanzan entre 10% y 15%. Por encima de eso, la tasa de
crecimiento consistentemente se reduce a medida que crece el tamao relativo
del gobierno. Otras investigaciones recientes, utilizando cifras de Estados
Unidos, indican tambin que en este pas el tamao del gobierno est muy por
encima del ptimo que maximizara el bienestar general.
<p>
 Por ejemplo, un estudio de 1995 de la Universidad de Ohio concluye que "el
tamao ptimo del gobierno federal es alrededor de 17,6% del PIB".  La
investigacin del National Center for Policy Analysis concluye que para
"maximizar el crecimiento econmico, la combinacin de tasas de impuestos
federales, estadales y locales debe totalizar entre 21,5% y 22,9% del PIB.
Este estudio del profesor Gerald Scully implica un sector gubernamental
central de aproximadamente 15% del PIB y que el actual tamao de los
gobiernos locales son exagerados tambin.
<p>
 No es ningn misterio que los gobiernos han crecido demasiado. Los grupos
de presin siempre tendrn mayor motivacin en la exigencia de nuevos y ms
extensos programas gubernamentales que aquellos otros grupos que piden
moderacin. Los impuestos y la habilidad de endeudarse de los gobiernos
imponen costos significantes a la economa y reducen los incentivos para
trabajar, ahorrar e invertir. Los gastos gubernamentales raramente tienen
los mismos controles que caracterizan al sector privado y pocas veces estn
sujetos a rigurosos anlisis de costo/beneficio.
<p>
 El gobierno grande es un fenmeno relativamente nuevo, en gran parte
causado por la influencia de socialistas y keynesianos, quienes al contrario
de los prceres de nuestra independencia ven al gobierno como una panacea en
vez de como una amenaza. Histricamente, la participacin del gobierno en el
PIB era modesta en casi todos los pases. Un reciente estudio del FMI
muestra que en las naciones industriales ms avanzadas el gasto
gubernamental como proporcin del PIB aument de un promedio de 8,3% en 1870
a 47,2% en 1994. Para 1929, el gasto total del gobierno en Estados Unidos
era 10% del PIB y del gobierno federal un minsculo 2,6% del PIB.
<p>
 El nfasis de la accin poltica debe cambiar de la nivelacin del
presupuesto a ms bien maximizar el crecimiento econmico. La realidad es
que la clase poltica se opone a medidas en favor del crecimiento porque el
bienestar general que se lograra reduce la dependencia de aquellos que
reparten los beneficios que otros pagan. 
<p>
 Aunque podemos claramente afirmar que una reduccin significante del tamao
del gobierno aumentar substancialmente el crecimiento econmico, tambin
tenemos que estar conscientes que a muchos polticos les interesa que esto
no se sepa. Mientras los medios de comunicacin y los empresarios no estn
dispuestos a educar a la gente en este sentido, los polticos seguirn
insistiendo en perjudicarnos dndonos tanto gobierno.

<H2>PERU: APERTURA EDUCACIONAL</H2>
<p>
Jos Luis Sardn
<p>
LIMA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- En trminos polticos y econmicos, 1996 termin resultando un
mal ao para el Per. Es temprano para calcular el dao que la toma de la
residencia del embajador japons por guerrilleros del MRTA har a la
economa peruana, pero ya sabemos que en 1996 se redujo notoriamente el
impulso en los procesos de estabilizacin y reforma estructural.
<p>
 Por primera vez desde 1991, en 1996 la inflacin fue mayor a
la registrada en el ao anterior, al alcanzar alrededor de 12%. As, en el
campo fundamental de la estabilizacin macroeconmica se empieza a observar
un retroceso respecto de los notables logros obtenidos en la primera mitad
de la dcada.
<p>
En el campo de la reforma econmica es verdad que se llevaron adelante,
contra las presiones demaggicas tradicionales, algunas privatizaciones
claves, como la de PetroPer. Sin embargo, tambin es cierto que los agentes
econmicos han recibido seales confusas que desdibujan el claro perfil de
las libertades econmicas antes establecidas. Un ejemplo reciente de ello
son las marchas y contramarchas en la legislacin laboral.
<p>
 No obstante este turbio panorama, a fin del ao fue
promulgada una ley que permite alentar grandes esperanzas. Se trata del
Decreto Legislativo 882, Ley de Promocin de la Inversin en la Educacin,
la cual resumida en trminos telegrficos reintroduce los derechos de
propiedad en el sector y, por tanto, devuelve a la iniciativa privada la
responsabilidad de las decisiones bsicas del proceso educativo.
En el Per no existe sector ms intervenido por el Estado que el educativo.
A nivel de los colegios, el Ministerio de Educacin tiene todava poderes
infinitos, herencia de la dictadura militar. A nivel de las universidades,
la situacin era igualmente grave, desde que estaban sujetas a un nico y
rgido esquema legal la Ley 23733, de 1983, al que deban ajustar su
organizacin y su funcionamiento. 
<p>
 Desde tiempos del general Velasco Ibarra, el rgimen legal
de las universidades ha sido profundamente hostil a la iniciativa privada.
Siguiendo las ideas del movimiento de reforma universitaria de Crdova, de
1918, la dictadura militar instal en este mbito un modelo de organizacin
cooperativo, inspirado en el tab ideolgico segn el cual las actividades
acadmicas deben ser realizadas por instituciones no contaminadas por la
bsqueda de ganancias.
<p>
 Con decisin y coraje saludables, la nueva ley ha atacado el
problema de fondo del sector, al reconocer los derechos de propiedad de las
entidades promotoras de las instituciones educativas particulares. Al
hacerlo, les brinda una marco legal bsico que les asegura las libertades
indispensables para disponer la orientacin axiolgica, la organizacin
administrativa y el rgimen de gobierno de este tipo de instituciones.
As, pues, ya no sern los expertos reales o supuestos del Ministerio de
Educacin quienes tomen las decisiones claves vinculadas al proceso
educativo. Tampoco sern los cuerpos colectivos asamblesticos, con sus
tortuosos procedimientos de votacin annima, perfectamente irresponsables.
Ahora stas correspondern a quienes invierten y arriesgan sus recursos
personales o familiares en instituciones educativas particulares.
<p>
 Al atreverse a romper prejuicios viejos y profundamente
arraigados en la sociedad peruana, el actual rgimen ha dado muestras de una
importante capacidad para reinventarse a s mismo. Viendo la evolucin del
proceso poltico peruano en una amplia perspectiva, y recordando los muchos
sufrimientos y esfuerzos que ha costado llegar al punto en el que ahora
estamos, cabe desear que esta ley nos augure un mejor 1997.

<H2>DESARROLLO SOSTENIBLE</H2>
<p>
James M. Sheehan*
<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El "desarrollo sostenible" es la razn de ser de
numerosos tratados y convenciones de las Naciones Unidas. Se trata del
pretexto ambiental para ampliar el poder de las burocracias nacionales e
internacionales en controlar la economa. Este tipo de planificacin central
se considera esencial para evitar que se agoten los recursos naturales y
para prevenir la contaminacin y la destruccin de la diversidad biolgica.
Los defensores del desarrollo sostenible exigen el establecimiento de un
marco de restricciones generales a las libertades individuales y econmicas,
al comercio, al progreso econmico y tecnolgico, a la agricultura.
<p>
 El desarrollo sostenible se fundamente  en la idea de que la globalizacin
de la tecnologa y del crecimiento econmico son inherentemente destructivos
del medio ambiente. Sin embargo,  las habituales predicciones apocalpticas
sobre la extincin de recursos naturales nunca han resultado ciertas. Los
crticos del capitalismo no toman en cuenta sus poderosas fuerzas
innovadoras. En un mercado libre, los empresarios compiten en desarrollar
soluciones eficientes, a bajos costos, para enfrentar problemas de escasez
de recursos, permitiendo que la gente haga ms con menos. El capitalismo ha
producido mayor nmero de innovaciones beneficiosas al medio ambiente que
cualquier otro sistema econmico. Aunque tal dinmica no existe en las
economas socialistas, las propuestas para un desarrollo sostenible se
copian la planificacin central socialista.
<p>
 La influyente Cumbre de Ro de 1992 defini el desarrollo sostenible como
el principio fundamental de la poltica ambiental mundial. Desde entonces,
burcratas internacionales, activistas ambientales y funcionarios de
gobiernos nacionales han desarrollado un creciente cuerpo de leyes
internacionales que incluyen tratados y acuerdos como la Agenda 21, la
Convencin Climtica Mundial, la Convencin de Biodiversidad y el Tratado de
los Ocanos. Estos tratados imponen costosas regulaciones y mayores gastos
estatales en programas derrochadores de ayuda internacional. Tales
transferencias se canalizan a travs de la Agencia para Desarrollo
Internacional del Departamento de Estado, la Facilidad Ambiental del Banco
Mundial y varias agencias de la ONU. Se trata del comienzo de un plan
ambiental centralizado.
<p>
 Las iniciativas ambientales promulgadas bajo el pretexto del desarrollo
sostenible tambin amenazan el futuro econmico de las naciones en
desarrollo. "Ecoimperialismo" es una nueva tendencia bajo la cual las
naciones industrializadas imponen nuevas normas ambientales al resto del
mundo. Las naciones en desarrollo, con las poblaciones ms pobres, son las
que ms sufren por tales restricciones. Estos pases temen que sus esfuerzos
por salir de la pobreza sean proscritos como "ambientalmente insostenibles"
por los pases industrializados, los cuales no enfrentaron las mismas
prohibiciones cuando avanzaban en su propio desarrollo.
<p>
 Los patrocinadores del desarrollo sostenible no ven el papel que juega la
pobreza en la degradacin ambiental. Las sociedades ricas gastan recursos
voluntariamente en mejorar la calidad ambiental, sin coercin gubernamental,
pero las naciones pobres no pueden darse ese lujo. Los habitantes de
naciones pobres son ms vulnerables a enfermedades, desastres naturales y
deficiencias alimentarias; ms de dos millones de personas mueren cada ao
por falta de salubridad bsica. Por lo tanto, una poltica mundial que
restrinja el desarrollo econmico bajo el pretexto de la "sustentacin" har
dao tanto a la gente como al medio ambiente.
<p>
 La historia nos muestra que la planificacin central caus una severa
degradacin ambiental en la antigua Unin Sovitica. Y la calidad ambiental
es un asunto local, no global, por lo que una exagerada centralizacin hara
ms dao que bien. Lo lgico es que las naciones compitan entre s con
diferentes enfoques. Los pases que efectivamente desregulan sus economas
tienden a promover ms rpidamente su desarrollo econmico, instrumentan
tecnologas ms limpias y crean la riqueza que har luego posible mejorar el
medio ambiente.
<p>
La bsqueda del "desarrollo sostenible" a travs de la expansin de la
autoridad reguladora y de burocracias internacionales conducirn
inevitablemente a fracasos econmicos y ambientales. El verdadero desarrollo
sostenible puede ser alcanzado slo por medio de las instituciones del
mercado: derechos de propiedad, intercambio voluntario y seguridad jurdica.

<H2>REFORMAS INCOMPLETAS EN AMERICA LATINA</H2>
<p>
Alvaro Vargas-Llosa*
<p>
LONDRES (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- "El manual del perfecto idiota latinoamericano" ha sido un
xito de librera en toda Amrica Latina. All los autores, utilizando algo
de humor, tratamos de destacar la incapacidad de nuestra clase poltica e
intelectual de renunciar a viejos mitos que por muchos aos han dado
explicaciones erradas a nuestras miserias.
<p>
 Pero el libro tambin desafa ese nuevo y peligroso mito que sostiene que
en Amrica Latina se est viviendo una revolucin de libre mercado. Es un
peligro grave y latente que ese valeroso pero limitado experimento
reformista -reduciendo la inflacin y el nmero de empresas estatales, a la
vez que muestra cierta hospitalidad hacia el inversionista extranjero- est
reanimando la oposicin populista y debilitando la economa de mercado
precisamente porque se trata de reformas incompletas.
<p>
 Si menos empresas estatales, menor inflacin y mayor inversin extranjera
fuesen suficientes para lograr estabilidad y prosperidad -un vuelco al
capitalismo- entonces Amrica Latina sera ya prspera desde hace tiempo.
Tuvimos tiempos, antes de la ola estatista, cuando la poltica monetaria no
estuvo frenticamente fuera de control. En esa poca, la inversin
extranjera se vea por todas partes; tanto que todas nuestras revoluciones
socialistas -desde Mxico en 1910,  Bolivia en 1952, Cuba en 1959 y Per en
1968- llegaron al poder en nombre de la "soberana". Pero la miseria persisti.
<p>
 Si una eficiencia macroeconmica fuera suficiente para lograr una sociedad
libre y prspera, porqu sigue Amrica Latina atrasada a pesar de haber
crecido a un promedio de 5% anual desde 1940, un crecimiento superior al
europeo en el mismo perodo?
<p>
 La respuesta es que las reformas parciales, concentradas en el manejo
macroeconmico, sin un claro compromiso con los derechos de propiedad,
mercados competitivos y slidas instituciones judiciales y polticas
conducen a sistemas mercantilistas que le niegan a las mayoras las
oportunidades y los beneficios del crecimiento econmico.
<p>
 Dos grandes debilidades afectan el actual proceso de reforma
latinoamericano. La primera es que se confunde a la empresa privada con el
capitalismo de libre mercado. La segunda es que el nfasis es en el manejo
macroeconmico, sin tomar en consideracin el orden institucional. 
<p>
 Las privatizaciones no son panaceas. Privatizaciones mal concebidas han
reemplazado monopolios pblicos con monopolios privados, transfiriendo la
propiedad mientras se protege el mercado y se fomenta escandalosamente la
corrupcin. Un ejemplo son las telecomunicaciones. Por toda Amrica Latina
los usuarios sufren de altas tarifas y mal servicio porque las empresas
telefnicas se vendieron a monopolios privados. Esto resulta obvio en Per,
Mxico y Argentina. Entonces los usuarios concluyen que el capitalismo, no
su ausencia, es la causa de tales abusos. No comprenden que eso es lo que
sucede cada vez que se transfieren mercados cerrados del control pblico al
privado.
<p>
 Problemas similares ocurren en gran variedad de servicios. El transporte
pblico en Buenos Aires est en manos privadas, pero cada ruta es un
monopolio de alguna empresa, por lo cual los argentinos estn en contra de
la privatizacin.
<p>
 Esos desaciertos son utilizados por los enemigos de las reformas, como el
poderoso sindicato colombiano de las telecomunicaciones que controla a la
mayora de los 14 mil empleados de la compaa de telfonos colombiana. En
su oposicin a la privatizacin, el sindicato apunta los defectos del
monopolio telefnico privado en Per.
<p>
 Esta proteccin de monopolios tambin crea la percepcin que liberalizacin
significa conceder privilegios a los ricos. Los 15 mexicanos que aparecen
entre los hombres ms ricos del mundo se beneficiaron de privilegios
concedidos por el estado. A su vez, el pueblo mexicano tiene pocas razones
para apoyar un proceso que los ha empobrecido.
<p>
 Por todo el continente se mantienen sectores intocables, llamados
estratgicos. El mejor ejemplo es el petrleo. En Venezuela, a pesar de los
fenomenales $250 mil millones generados en los ltimos 20 aos por su
monopolio estatal petrolero, se estima que 80% de la poblacin vive por
debajo del nivel de pobreza. Sin embargo, sugerencias sobre la privatizacin
del petrleo es respondida histricamente, como sucede tambin en Mxico y
con Codelco en Chile.
<p>
 Amrica Latina ha ignorado olmpicamente la importancia de instituciones
tales como la justicia, la propiedad privada, monedas slidas y hasta la
misma democracia. El resultado es un proceso de reformas con bases dbiles
que invitan al desastre.
<p>
 La falta de reforma institucional est muy extendido. Los derechos de
propiedad no se toman en cuenta o son evadidos por el gobierno. Durante los
aos 80, en un proceso silencioso, los campesinos peruanos de hecho
privatizaron 60% de las tierras que haban sido colectivizadas por una
reforma agraria socialista en los aos 70. Sin embargo, cuatro millones de
parceleros andinos todava no tienen sus ttulos de propiedad.
<p>
 En Mxico, el derecho de propiedad difcilmente existe con el artculo 27
de la Constitucin que mantiene que "la nacin" es la duea de todas las
tierras. La muy mentada reforma del ejido no se ha traducido en derechos de
propiedad para los campesinos. No es posible confiar en las instituciones
peruanas luego que el presidente disolvi al Poder Judicial en 1992,
reemplazndolo por otro polticamente subordinado. Esa institucin no evit
que el Per, segn el informe de Amnista Internacional de 1996, se
convirtiera en el pas en Amrica Latina con ms presos polticos -unos
1.100- despus de Cuba. En Amrica Latina se aparta la libertad econmica de
su esencial base poltica e institucional.
<p>
 En Amrica Latina jams se ha intentado una reforma liberal. El idiota
latinoamericano   siempre atribuye nuestros fracasos a conspiraciones: la
Doctrina Monroe, la United Fruit, el FMI, el Banco Mundial. El ltimo
enemigo es el neoliberalismo, o sea las reformas de libre mercado.
Nuevamente se apunta donde no es.

<p>
FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Muchos ejecutivos de empresas se preguntan cmo
es que tantos de sus empleados que se han graduado de universidades no son
capaces de escribir un memorndum, hacer algunos clculos sencillos o pensar
y expresarse lgicamente. Aqu les doy una muy pequea parte de la
respuesta, contndoles sobre un reciente evento "educacional" en mi universidad.
<p>
 El Centro de Servicio Educacional y de Liderazgo Estudiantil de la
Universidad George Mason distribuy invitaciones para la "Cena del Hambre",
un evento promocionado como educacional "para la comunidad estudiantil
acerca del efecto dramtico del hambre a nivel mundial. La cena dramatiza la
desigual distribucin de recursos como elemento que contribuye al hambre" y
la velada prometa promover "el anlisis crtico, analtico e imaginativo
sobre los que basar decisiones ticas".
<p>
 Luego de donar dos latas de sopa o $3, a cada estudiante asistente a la
cena se le daba un boleto. El color del boleto que a cada uno, por suerte,
le tocaba indicaba su categora en la cena. A 16 estudiantes le tocaron
boletos del "Primer Mundo" y ellos fueron conducidos formalmente a una mesa
cubierta con un mantel de hilo y adornada con flores, donde disfrutaron de
una cena de cuatro deliciosos platos, mientras escuchaban msica clsica
interpretada por un do de flauta y oboe. Se les dijo que ellos
representaban al 15% de los habitantes de Estados Unidos, a los ricos.
<p>
 A otros 30 estudiantes le tocaron boletos del "Segundo Mundo". Comieron
hamburguesas con papitas fritas en platos de plstico y mesas sin mantel.
Les dijeron ser los representantes del 25% de la poblacin que apenas logra
cubrir sus necesidades bsicas.
<p>
 Los 140 estudiantes con boletos del "Tercer Mundo" recibieron un vaso de
agua y media taza de arroz, para que lo comieran con las manos, sentados en
el suelo. Se les inform que representaban a los pobres, 60% de la poblacin
de Estados Unidos. 
<p>
 Un conferencista de la Coalicin de los Sintecho expuso que el hambre y la
falta de viviendas se debe a la poca construccin a precios razonables que
hay, a falta de empleos que paguen salarios aceptables y a falta de
servicios de salud a precios asequibles. Tambin dijo a los estudiantes que
Estados Unidos tiene suficientes recursos para acabar con la pobreza, pero
prefiere dedicarlos a gastos de defensa.
<p>
 Este evento, tpico entre muchos otros que a diario se montan en nuestras
universidades, no fue ms que propaganda, indoctrinacin y mentiras
dirigidas a mentes jvenes ya repletas de falsos sentimentalismos. La parte
ms insidiosa fue la que fomenta la envidia. Darle agua y arroz al 60% de
los asistentes, con el mensaje de que ellos representaban a los pobres de
Estados Unidos, es repugnante.
<p>
 Los hechos son diferentes. Los pobres en este pas son 14%. La obesidad es
un mayor problema nutricional entre los estadounidenses pobres que la
flacura. Los pobres de Estados Unidos comen ms carne y tienen ms espacio

 Este centro propagandstico en mi universidad es apenas una pequea muestra

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America's tax system is a disgrace. It severely penalizes  productive
economic behavior, especially by savers and investors  whose capital income is
subjected to as many as four layers of taxation.  It is so bewildering that
complying with its increasingly  complex forms, regulations, and other documents
consumes billions  of hours each year. And it imposes staggering economic damage
 reducing economic output by hundreds of billions of dollars  each year. The
real cost, however, is measured in lost jobs,  foregone income, lower living
standards, and reduced economic security.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>But lost prosperity is only part of the story. For many  Americans the most
reprehensible aspect of the current system is the way  it allows special
interests to manipulate the tax code for their  own advantage. Lobbyists with
enough money and access tilt the  playing field, creating special preferences
for the politically  well-connected. With the tax burden at record levels, many
taxpayers  understandably want to protect their earnings, but today's system  of
loopholes, credits, exemptions, and deductions fosters a  pervasive sense of
unfairness and encourages lawmakers to impose  even higher tax rates on income
which does not enjoy special status.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The best way to solve America's tax problem is to adopt a flat  tax. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  No tax system is good for the
economy, but a flat tax would  allow significantly stronger economic growth by
replacing the  current tax code with a low rate, simple tax that removes the
bias  against savings and investment. Perhaps equally important, it would 
restore integrity to a tax system that has become synonymous  with
special-interest corruption. Under the flat tax, every taxpayer  plays by the
same rules. The multitude of forms required by today's  arcane tax law are
replaced by two simple postcards, one for  individuals' labor income and the
other for business and capital  income. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1995, the new Congress took a significant step in the right  direction by
delivering on its promise to pass badly needed  family tax relief to spur
economic growth. Taxpayers were  disappointed, however, when  just two years
after signing the largest tax  hike in U.S. history  President Clinton vetoed
the Balanced  Budget Act of 1995, which included about $220 billion in tax
relief over  a seven-year period. This relatively small package  which  amounts
to returning to the taxpayer just 2 cents of every dollar from  the $11.5
trillion in tax revenues the government expects to  collect over the next seven
years  included a $500-per-child tax credit,  a reduction in the capital gains
tax, and a modest expansion of  Individual Retirement Accounts. This legislation
marked the first  time since 1981 that Congress had voted to ease the tax
burden, but  it still did not come close to offsetting the negative impact of 
tax increases imposed by Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton  in 1990 and
1993; the 1995 tax cut was less than one-third the  combined size of these two
tax increases.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P> 
<P>As important as Congress's proposed tax cuts were to  taxpayers 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  and economic growth, they amounted
to using a Band-Aid  when what the situation really required was radical
surgery.  Serious, fundamental reform must be based on a recognition of two 
essential realities: Excessive taxation harms the economy, and the  liberal
notion that any problem can be solved by taxing the rich  is self-defeating.
Higher tax rates simply encourage wealthy  taxpayers, who already are
over-taxed, to hide, shelter, underreport,  and reduce their income. A much
better way to get the rich to  pay more, and one that will help lower - and
middle-income  workers by boosting savings and investment, is to cut tax rates.
The  attached <a href="tax_1.gif">chart</a> illustrates how lower tax rates in the 1980s  dramatically
increased the percentage of the income tax burden borne  by the rich. Even more
important, however, these reductions  triggered the longest peacetime economic
expansion in U.S. history and  led to the creation of 21 million new jobs.

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The conclusion is obvious: The tax system today is so  fundamentally flawed
that the only realistic solution is to scrap it and  begin again.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These flaws in the current tax code can be communicated by  emphasizing
three main themes:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1. Excessive tax rates.</B> The federal income tax has a top rate  of
39.6 percent. This means that successful entrepreneurs and  others with high
incomes receive barely 60 cents of benefit for every  dollar they contribute to
the nation's economy. The result is less  incentive to engage in productive
behavior, which leads in turn  to lower levels of work, saving, investment,
risk-taking, and  entrepreneurship. Added to this are state and local taxes,
which can  increase the total burden by as much as 11 percent, and the  Medicare
payroll tax, which adds another 2.9 percent. Moreover, while  those with lower
incomes may seem to be penalized less, usually  facing income tax rates of 15
percent and 28 percent, they also are  subjected to the full 15.3 percent
payroll tax, <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#1">1</A></B></TT> in
addition to state  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  local taxes. In other words,
almost all taxpayers are paying  about 40 percent of each additional dollar of
income they earn to  the government.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>According to the Tax Foundation, the average taxpayer in  1995 worked until
May 6 to satisfy the revenue demands of  federal, state, and local government.
This number could have dropped by  a day or two in 1996 if the President had
signed the legislation  approved by Congress in 1995. Nevertheless, the cost of
the tax  system remains the largest item in the average family's budget, 
exceeding the combined cost of food, clothing, shelter, and  transportation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Complexity.</B> Americans spend too much time deciphering  IRS forms,
regulations, and rulings. Several years ago, an  IRS-commissioned study
estimated that taxpayers spend 5.4 billion hours  on their federal tax returns 
more than all the man-hours used in  the entire automotive industry in America.
According to the  Tax Foundation, our tax system imposes $192 billion in 
compliance costs on the economy: not money sent to Washington, not  foregone
economic growth, but the cost of the lawyers,  accountants, lobbyists, tax
preparers, and man-hours needed to comply with  the current tax code. Of this
amount, three-quarters is due to the  federal income tax alone.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Bias against savings and investment.</B> The current system 
discourages Americans from saving and investing. Perhaps the  most pernicious
feature of the tax code is the way it subjects capital  income to discriminatory
treatment. If a taxpayer earns a dollar,  he can choose (after paying tax on the
money) to consume that  income or use it for savings and investment. If he
consumes the  dol
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  lar, he will pay very little, if
any, additional federal tax. If  he chooses to invest his earnings, he is
treated like a criminal.  Depending on the type of investment, the government
may  subject any returns to as many as four additional layers of tax; needless 
to say, however, it does not share in any losses if the investment  does not
perform as expected. Not only is this policy unfair, but it  has profoundly
adverse consequences for the economy since all  economic theories agree that the
only way to generate higher  wages and rising living standards is through
savings and investment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>How Taxes Slow the Economy and Cost Jobs </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The biggest long-term problem with the tax system is its impact  on income
and productivity. Although much has been made of a  supposed decline in
middle-class incomes over the last 20 years,  all income groups have seen their
incomes rise over time.  However, our current tax system has made this increase
smaller than it  could have been.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There is almost universal agreement among economists   even Marxists  that
incomes depend on productivity. Workers are  paid on the basis of what they
produce. Put another way, for incomes  to rise, productivity must increase, but
productivity increases  are closely linked to savings and to investment in
capital and  labor. Thus, the ability of workers to produce more is a function
of  increases in the quantity and quality of the machinery, tools,  equipment,
and technology with which they work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The only systematic way to increase living standards and  income over time
is through more savings and investment in capital  and labor; in other words, in
the language of economics,  increased 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  capital formation boosts the
productivity of labor. Capital and  labor are what economists call complementary
goods, because  the value of each increases when they are linked together. A 
citizen who invests money in a pension fund will get a good return on  that
money if it is put to work producing goods. Labor, conversely,  will receive
higher wages as a result of the new investment made  possible by those
retirement savings.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>This link between labor and capital explains why farmers  in America earn
more than farmers in Bangladesh. American  farmers do not work harder. They are
not smarter. They earn more  because they produce more, and they produce more
because they work  with sophisticated machinery, equipment, tools, technology,
and  production processes. This is also why factory workers in  America,
Germany, and Japan earn more than factory workers in  Brazil, Nigeria, and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, our tax code imposes particularly harsh penalties  on
so-called capital income. Consider, for example, a family that  decides to
sacrifice by setting aside 10 percent of its income in  order to build up a
retirement nest egg. It invests the money in a  new company, exposing itself to
the possible loss of all its savings.  One would assume the government would
want to reward this type  of entrepreneurial decision, but just the opposite is
the case. If  the family's investment turns out to be a wise one, the 
government imposes at least three, and sometimes four, levels of tax. First, 
any income of the new company is subject to the corporate income  tax; second,
when the money is paid out as a dividend to the  shareholder, the income is
subject to the personal income tax; third,  if the family ever decides to sell
its stock, it must pay a tax on  capital gains; and fourth, if this family
invested very wisely and  helped 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  create tomorrow's Microsoft, the
government will tax the value  of its assets through the estate tax as its
members die. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As bad as all this sounds, it gets even worse. Policies such as  the
alternative minimum tax and depreciation often force  businesses and individuals
to overstate their income, making the real tax  rate even higher than the
statutory top rate. Our hypothetical  family could try to avoid some of these
taxes by simply putting money  in the bank, but even this has high costs. First,
the rate of return  on their savings will be lower because excessive taxes lower
the  demand for credit. Second, the government double taxes  savings. With the
exception of strictly limited IRAs and a handful of  other savings plans like
401(k)s, the money put into savings accounts  is taxed when it is deposited and
taxed on any interest it earns.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Needless to say, this pernicious anti-savings, anti-investment  bias in the
tax code sharply reduces the level of capital  formation. Many taxpayers look at
how the government punishes  success, decide that the financial sacrifice is not
worth it, and  consume their income rather than save and invest it. Ironically,
many  of these tax policies are designed to punish the &quot;rich,&quot; since 
they naturally have more money available for savings and  investment. The main
effect, however, is to reduce the wages and salaries  of people with lower and
middle incomes. Most wealthy people  can use tax shelters like municipal bonds
or hide their money  offshore to avoid taxes targeted at the so-called rich.
What these taxes  really do is discourage those on the lower rungs of the 
economic ladder from trying to become rich.
</P>
<P>
</P> 
<P>By contrast, the tax cuts of the 1980s show what happens if  tax 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  policy reduces the burden on
working, saving, and investing.  Once the economy received an unambiguous tax
cut, everything  President Reagan said would happen if tax rates were reduced
began  to happen. The economy began its longest period of growth in  peacetime
history. Incomes began to rise, with the increase benefiting  all groups  rich,
middle-class, and lower-income (see <a href="tax_3.gif">chart</a>). And,  of course, the miraculous job
creation machine began: 21 million  new jobs were created during the Reagan
boom.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>How Washington has Hiked Taxes on  Children  </B><TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#2">2</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Federal taxation of families with children has increased  dramatically over
the past four decades. In 1948, the typical family of  four paid just 3 percent
of its income to the federal government in  direct taxes. In 1994, the
equivalent family paid 24.5 percent of  its income to the federal government. As
the <a href="tax_2.gif">chart</a> below  shows, when state and local and indirect federal taxes are
included, the  tax burden on that family equals 37.6 percent of its income.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Federal income taxes have risen much faster for families with  children than
for other groups of Americans in the last four  decades. The root cause of this
growing anti-family bias is the  eroding value of the personal exemption. The
personal exemption for  children was intended to offset part of the annual cost
of raising  a child by allowing families to deduct an amount of money  from
their taxable income. In 1948, the personal exemption was  $600. This was equal
to roughly 17 percent of the median income of  a family of four (then $3,468)
and shielded 68 percent of  that family's income from federal income tax.
Families could  protect most of the remaining 32 percent by itemizing deductions
or  by taking the standard deduction. The result: In the late 1940s  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  early 1950s, the average family
with children paid little or no  income tax.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the past four decades, however, increases in the personal  exemption have
lagged far behind the rise in incomes and  inflation. As the value of the
personal exemption has declined, the  income tax paid by families with children
has increased. For the  personal exemption today to have the same value relative
to family  income that it had in 1948, it would have to have risen to $7,000 in 
1992, and to $8,000 in 1996. Instead, it is worth only $2,250 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The second blow to family finances has been the increase in  Social Security
taxes, technically known as &quot;payroll taxes.&quot;  In  1948, workers paid a
2 percent Social Security tax on annual wages of  up to $3,000; 1 percent was
paid directly by the employee and 1  percent indirectly by the employer through
the so-called  employer share.<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#3">3</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By 1995, combined Social Security taxes have risen to 15.3  percent of wages
(7.65 percent each paid by employer and  employee) on incomes up to $61,200.
While all workers have suffered  from skyrocketing payroll taxes, the burden has
been most severe  for working families with children. Social Security taxes,
unlike  regular income taxes, are not adjusted for the number of dependents  in
the family, so a working parent trying to support a family of  four feels the
sting of this tax far more sharply than a single person  at the same wage level.
The effect of Social Security taxation is  particularly severe on lower-income
parents; a family with an  income of $25,000 per year, for instance, pays $3,825
in payroll taxes.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 --> 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The Government Assault on Family Income. Direct federal  taxes as a share of
median family income has increased  dramatically over the past four decades. In
1948, effective tax rates equaled  3 percent of income for the average family of
four. By 1970,  they had risen to 16 percent; by 1994, to 24.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The income loss due to increased taxation has seriously  strained American
family finances and profoundly affected American  family life. Chart 4 shows the
effects of increases in federal  income and Social Security taxes since 1948 on
the finances of the  average family. Total pre-tax income for the median family
of four in  1994 was $56,608. <B><TT><A HREF="ftnt2.htm">4</A></TT></B>
 After taxes, this family's income fell to $45,104.  If federal taxes as a
percentage of family income were restored  to 1948 levels, the family's post-tax
income would have  been $10,084 higher, or $55,188. In other words, the loss of
income  in 1992 because of the increase in federal taxes as a share of  family
income, due to the falling value of the personal exemption and  the rise in
Social Security taxes since the late 1940s, was $10,084.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This income loss severely affects the ability of families to  support
themselves. For example, the typical family of four has  monthly mortgage
payments of $664 and grocery bills of $332. Thus  the $10,084 in income lost to
this family due to the 45-year rise  in federal taxes costs this family 15
months worth of mortgage  payments, or 12 months mortgage combined with six
months worth  of groceries.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Solution: Tax Credits for Children</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are two practical ways to reduce the tax burden on  families with
children: by increasing the value of the personal exemption  or 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  by allowing for the use of tax
credits. Although many positive  arguments can be made for increasing the
personal exemption,  the tax credit is better in the long run because it is less
complex  and can be used more effectively to reduce the tax burden on 
lower-income working families.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>With an income tax exemption, income equal to the amount of  the exemption
is excluded from tax. However, the actual tax savings  a family receives from
such an exemption will depend upon the  tax rate to which it is subject. Thus,
for a family in the 15 percent  income tax bracket, a $500 increase in the
dependent exemption  decreases income taxes by $75. A $1,000 increase in the 
exemption, as some have proposed, decreases a family's tax burden by  $150. But
for a family in the 28 percent tax bracket, a $1,000 increase  in the personal
exemption reduces the income tax burden by $280   86 percent more tax relief
than for families in the 15  percent bracket.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By contrast, under a tax credit, the amount of the credit is  deducted from
taxes paid  below the line, so to speak  directly  reducing tax liability. Also,
unlike a tax exemption, a credit gives the  same amount of tax relief to every
taxpayer, regardless of income or  tax rate status. The two examples below, one
for a family of four  earning $30,000 per year and the other for the same family
 earning $75,000 per year, show clearly how the credit works.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Example #1:</B> Under current law, a family earning $30,000 per  year
(which puts it in the 15 percent income tax bracket) has an  income tax
liability of $1,988. Because this family has two children,  the $500 child tax
credit reduces the income tax bill by $1,000  leaving a net income tax bill of
$988. This is a 50 percent reduction in  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  family's tax burden.
</P>
<P>
</P> 
<P><B>Example #2:</B> Under current law, a family earning $75,000 per  year
(which puts it in the 28 percent income tax bracket) has a tax  liability of
$8,114. Deducting $1,000  $500 for each child   leaves this family with a net
income tax bill of $7,114. This is a 11  percent reduction in the family's tax
burden.

<P><B>The Crushing Burden of Social Security</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Much of this chapter has focused on the crushing burden of  taxes in general
and the anti-growth features of the income tax in  particular. No treatment of
federal taxation would be complete,  however, without some discussion of the
interrelated problems of  the payroll tax and the Social Security retirement
system. The need  for reform is critical. The Bipartisan Entitlement Commission 
estimates that Social Security faces an unfunded liability of $7.3  trillion.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The burden of financing Social
Security has reached crisis  proportions. First, the payroll tax rate has risen
dramatically over  time. As the attached chart illustrates, the payroll tax has
jumped from  2 percent in 1949 to 15.3 percent today (the government  promotes
the fiction that half is paid by the employer and half by the  employee; in
reality, of course, the full burden is borne by the  worker in the form of lower
take-home pay). Of the 15.3 percent  payroll tax, 12.4 percent is dedicated to
Social Security, and 2.9 percent  is used to finance Medicare spending.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The rapidly rising tax rate is only part of the
problem. When  Social Security was created in the 1930s, only the first $3,000
of  in
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  come was subject to tax. As the
graph demonstrates, however,  the amount of income subject to tax has
skyrocketed to more  than $60,000. The combination of these two effects  higher
tax  rates and an increase in the amount of wages that can be taxed   has caused
the payroll tax to become the biggest tax burden for  the majority of taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     In 1937, the maximum tax bill for the program
was $60.  Twenty years later, in 1957, the maximum tax bill was less than $170. 
By 1977, it had climbed to more than $1,600. Today, a worker's  Social Security
tax bill can reach more than $7,500. The 2.9  percent Medicare portion of the
payroll tax compounds the burden,  particularly because there is no limit on the
amount of income  subject to this additional levy. This spiraling tax bill has a
negative  economic impact. The payroll tax is an unambiguous hindrance to  job
creation, lowering take-home pay and reducing the level of  labor-force
participation.

<P>The other major flaw in the Social Security system is that it  is bankrupt.
Simply stated, the Social Security system has  promised benefits that cannot be

</P>
<P><B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1993, with nary a vote to spare in either the House or the  Senate,
President Clinton managed to obtain approval for the  largest tax increase in
history. In his second year, 1994, he proposed   but ultimately failed to get
enacted  an even larger tax increase  to pay for his government-run health care
scheme. Then, on  December 16, 1994, shortly after the mid-term elections that
put a  Republican majority in the House for the first time in 40 years, the 
President reversed himself and proposed a &quot;Middle-Class Bill  of Rights&quot;
which included modest tax cuts for families with  children, tax deductions for
education expenses, and an expansion of  Individual Retirement Accounts. This
effort was short-lived,  however, because the Administration spent much of the
rest of 1995  opposing the tax cuts proposed by the Republican Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton's record tax increase was a complete failure.  Tax
revenues are rising slower than they did during the  tax-cutting Reagan years.
The Clinton tax hike also hindered deficit  reduction. The following chart shows
CBO projections of annual budget  deficits after the Clinton tax increase. After
a modest decline, due  primarily to the economy's slow climb out of the early
1990s  slow
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  down, projected budget deficits
begin to climb rapidly,  reaching more than $400 billion after the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Higher taxes also slow income growth for American families.  The following
charts illustrate the strong relationship between  taxes and family incomes.
During the Reagan years, income rose,  reversing the dismal economic performance
of the Carter years  when payroll tax hikes and bracket creep resulted in major
tax  increases. Unfortunately, Ronald Reagan's pro-growth policies were 
reversed by the Bush and Clinton Administrations. The effect on  the economy was
both predictable and inevitable: Incomes again  began to fall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the 1980s, Reagan's opponents charged that the rich  were getting
richer and the poor were getting poorer. As the  numbers clearly show, however,
all income classes benefited from  the economy's performance. For the most part,
conversely, all  income classes suffer when the economy falters. The only
exception to  this trend has been during the Clinton Administration when, for 
the first time, the rich actually have become richer as the poor  have grown
poorer. The lesson from these statistics is clear:  Higher taxes slow the
economy, but the rich usually can adjust their  affairs to limit the damage,
leaving the poor most vulnerable to  the downturn.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Reagan Years</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some Americans have been seduced into thinking that the tax  burden is too
low. They have been told, often by the  establishment media, that &quot;Reagan
era&quot; tax cuts starved the government of  revenue and that higher taxes are
needed simply to offset the effect  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  these the massive cuts. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>As Chart 8 illustrates, however, there was no loss of tax  revenue during
the Reagan years. The effect is particularly  pronounced when one realizes that
the Reagan tax cuts were phased in, and  the economy did not actually receive a
net tax cut until January  1, 1983.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even using 1981 as the base year (and effectively blaming  Reagan for the
recession that began during Carter's last fiscal year),  tax revenues expanded
from $599 billion in 1981 to $991 billion  in 1989. Even after adjusting for
inflation, revenues grew by 20  percent. Compare this to the level of revenue
growth under the  high-tax regimes of Bush and Clinton. As the <a href="tax_8.gif">chart</a> shows, tax 
revenues grew faster under the Reagan tax cuts than they have in  recent years
under higher tax rates.<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#7">7</A></B></TT></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Critics claim that the Reagan tax cuts caused the deficit to  climb, but
this accusation does not withstand scrutiny. As the  following graph shows, the
deficit began to increase two fiscal years  before Ronald Reagan became
President and continued to rise during  his first two years in office, until the
economy received a  significant net tax cut on January 1, 1983. From that point
on, the deficit  began to shrink, falling to about $150 billion by the time
Reagan  left office.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps most important of all, the deficit would have continued  to fall had
Reagan's policies been left in place. In January 1989   the month Ronald Reagan
left office  the Democratically  controlled Congressional Budget Office
published estimates showing  what would happen to the deficit if Reagan's
policies were left in  place. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  As <a href=tax_10.gif">Chart 10</a> shows, the CBO
projected that the deficit would  continue to fall every year. Unfortunately,
both George Bush and  Bill Clinton raised taxes, causing economic growth to
falter and  discouraging taxpayers from earning and reporting more taxable 
income, and the deficit increased.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The evidence is clear. Notwithstanding all the Washington  rhetoric, the tax
burden is too high. The deficit is the result of  excessive spending, not low
tax rates. The evidence of the past 20 years  confirms that high tax rates and
rising tax burdens mean higher  deficits.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Abandoned Families</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Clinton campaigned for President by promising to give tax cuts  to working
families with children, but he did little to honor  this promise until after the
electorate brought new leadership to  Congress in 1994. Almost one year after
introducing his  &quot;Middle-Class Bill of Rights,&quot; Clinton again
abandoned families when he  vetoed the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which had as
its centerpiece  a $500-per-child tax credit for working families. Clinton 
claimed, among other things, that proposed reforms in the earned  income tax
credit (EITC) included in the plan would raise taxes on  families earning less
than $30,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Yet a comparison of President Clinton's &quot;Middle-Class Bill  of Rights&quot;
(with its $300-per-child tax credit for dependent  children below age 13 in
families with annual incomes below  $75,0008) and the Balanced Budget Act vetoed
by Clinton (with its  $500-per-child tax cut forall children in families earning
up to  $110,0009) shows that the congressional plan would benefit 5.4 million 
more 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  low-income working families with
children than the Clinton  plan, even after accounting for changes in the EITC
in the  Balanced Budget Act. Many families with children and annual incomes 
below $24,000 would be denied the $300 child credit under  the Clinton plan
(receiving only the EITC) but would be eligible  for both the $500 child credit
and the EITC under the  congressional plan.
</P>
<P>
</P> 
<P>Overall, Congress's $500-per-child tax credit would benefit  23 million more
children than the Administration's  $300-per-child credit. Congress would give
tax relief to 10.4 million families  with children who would receive no tax
relief under the Clinton plan.  In addition, there would be millions of families
under the  Clinton plan in which at least one sibling received tax relief but
others  did not. Taken together, the number of children not qualifying for  any
tax relief under Clinton would be 23 million less than under  the Balanced
Budget Act. These children would receive $15.4  billion in tax relief under the
BBA but nothing under the Clinton plan.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are three major reasons why the Clinton plan denies tax  relief to so
many families with children:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reason #1:</B> Clinton's tax cut benefits only families with  children
under age 13, denying tax relief to the families of at least 2.8  million other
children whose parents earn less than $30,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reason #2:</B> Clinton's tax cut phases out for families earning 
between $60,000 and $75,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reason #3:</B> The Clinton plan requires low-income families to  deduct
their EITC benefits from their income tax bill before  taking 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  the $300-per-child tax credit. By
contrast, the Balanced  Budget Act allows a low-income family to take the
$500-per-child  tax credit first, then receiving the full measure of the EITC on
top  of the child credit. <B><TT><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#10">10</A></TT></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These three elements of the Clinton plan make it substantially  inferior to
Congress's $500-per-child tax credit, even considering  the reforms in the EITC.

<P>THE 104TH CONGRESS
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The centerpiece of the new Congress's Contract With  America was a
commitment to pass a plan that balances the budget by  2002, provides
substantial tax relief to families with children and  seniors, creates jobs, and
spurs economic growth. The new House  leadership rightly understood that tax
cuts must be included in any  credible balanced budget plan for both economic
and political  reasons. First, cutting taxes gives the economy a needed boost
while  Washington curbs spending in order to balance the budget.  Economic
models show that cutting taxes while balancing the budget  produces higher
economic growth than balancing the budget  without tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There also is a political element to cutting taxes while  balancing the
budget. Tax cuts  especially broad-based cuts such as  the $500-per-child tax
credit and capital gains reform  build  powerful constituencies to counter the
entrenched interests who  survive by exploiting government programs. In the
absence of tax  cuts, these pro-spending lobbies would be the only voices heard 
during any debate over balancing the budget. So, too, tax cuts  &quot;sugar-coat&quot;
the political pain of spending cuts. For example, families  in the typical
congressional district would receive some $54  million per year from the
$500-per-child tax credit. It is difficult to  imagine that any single federal
spending project of similar  magnitude could benefit as many constituents at the
same time. Thus, the  political advantages of tax cuts more than outweigh the
political  disadvantages of cutting spending.

<P>The good news for hard-pressed families and businesses is that  tax cuts
were at the forefront of the agenda during the 1995-1996  budget debate and that
the new Congress fulfilled its promise to  deliver a balanced budget plan with
tax cuts to Bill Clinton. The  bad news is that Clinton vetoed the balanced
budget and tax cut plan   just two years after signing the largest tax increase
in history   and that the vision of taking taxpayers' money back from

to help families with  children and seniors and spur economic growth. Although 
many Washington insiders charged that the projected tax cut was  too large (some
$354 billion over seven years), it amounted to  returning to taxpayers only 3

closing special  tax breaks for certain corporations and industries. Though this

&quot;non-refundable,&quot; meaning the total  value of the credit may not
exceed a family's income tax bill. But it  does provide uniform tax relief to
all families with incomes up  to $110,000 per year, thereby reducing a
low-income family's  tax burden by a much greater proportion than an 
upper-income family's. For taxpayers filing jointly with incomes  above
$110,000, the credit phases out at a rate of $25 for each $1,000  in earnings
above the threshold (a range of $20,000), phasing  out fully at $130,000 in
income. For families with two children,  the two credits for which they are
eligible are phased out fully  at 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->  $150,000 in income. For single
filers, the credit begins to  phase out at $75,000 in income.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Families with children are overtaxed.</B> In 1948, the
average  American family with children paid only 3 percent of its income to 
Uncle Sam. Today, the same family pays 24.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Giving a family of four a $500-per-child tax credit is equivalent  to
giving that family one month's mortgage payment and  one month's groceries.</B>
The average family spends $644 per month  in mortgage payments and $332 per
month on groceries. Thus,  the $1,000 in tax relief the congressional plan would
give to a  family with two children would help this family pay one month's 
mortgage and groceries.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Millions of families stand to benefit.</B> The families of 51  million
American children (28 million taxpaying families) are eligible  for the
$500-per-child tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Family tax relief helps families in every state.</B> The typical 
congressional district has some 117,000 children in families eligible for  a
$500 tax credit. Thus, families in the typical district would  receive $54
million per year in tax relief. Tables showing the benefits  of family tax
relief by state and congressional district are included  in the appendix to this
chapter.

<P><B>Congress's $500-per-child tax credit would eliminate the  entire income
tax burden for 3.5 million taxpayers caring for 8.7  million 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->  children.</B> These 3.5 million
families would receive over $2.2  billion per year in tax relief. Families with
two children earning up  to $24,000 per year would see their entire income tax
burden  eliminated by a $500-per-child tax credit, and families with three 
children and incomes as high as $26,000 also would have their  income tax bill
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Most families are middle-class</B>. The $500 child credit directs  89
percent of all benefits to families with adjusted gross incomes  below $75,000
per year  middle-income by any standard   and over 96 percent to families with
incomes below $100,000.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Cutting taxes for all families  regardless of income  is  fair.</B>
Congress's plan would cut the income tax burden of a family  of four earning
$30,000 per year by 51 percent and the income  tax burden of a family earning
$40,000 per year by 30 percent.  Meanwhile, a family of four earning $75,000
would see their tax  burden reduced by 12 percent, and a family earning $100,000
per  year would receive a tax cut of just 7.4 percent.

<P><B>2. Higher Standard Deduction to Reduce the Marriage Penalty.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under current law, dual-income married couples who file a  joint return can
end up paying more taxes than two single  taxpayers filing individually. The BBA
takes a small step toward  reducing this &quot;marriage penalty&quot; by
increasing the value of the  standard deduction for these working couples
relative to the value of  the same deduction for singles. In 1996, for instance,
the ratio of  the standard deduction for married couples would be 1.68 of the 
value of the individual deduction. By 2005 and beyond, the ratio  would 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  be 2.00.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Tax Credit for Adoption.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The estimated two million families ready to adopt children  face huge
expenses during the adoption process, but current tax  law does not allow them
to deduct adoption costs from their tax  bill. The BBA plan makes a substantial
commitment to  encouraging adoption by giving adoptive families a tax credit of
$5,000 to  offset such expenses as adoption fees, court costs, attorneys' fees, 
and other related expenses. This credit is available in full to  families
earning up to $75,000 per year and phased out gradually for  families earning up
to $115,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4. Tax Deduction for Dependent Parents.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The current tax code provides little relief for the care of  elderly parents
or grandparents. The standard personal exemption  of $2,500 is available, but,
as with the dependent child  exemption, the value of the credit is greater for
middle - and  upper-income families than for modest-income families in the 15
percent  income bracket. For example, while the standard deduction of $2,500 
allows a family in the 15 percent bracket to lower its income tax  by $375, the
same deduction allows a family in the 28 percent  bracket to lower its tax by
$700.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The BBA plan offers additional tax relief for the care of  parents and
grandparents in the form of an &quot;above-the-line&quot; deduction  of $1,000
per family member. Such a credit could help many  families 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  that prefer to care for elderly
relatives at home but cannot  afford the expense.

</P>
<P><B>5. Favorable Tax Treatment for Private Long-Term Care.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Although medical expenses are deductible from federal taxes  when they
exceed a certain percentage of income, long-term care  expenses today generally
are not tax-deductible. Under the  BBA, starting in 1996, long-term care
insurance generally would  be treated the same as accident and health insurance,
and  employers would be allowed to provide their employees with tax-free 
long-term care insurance just as they now often provide medical  benefits.
Eligible long-term care premiums and expenses for  qualified long-term care
services would be treated the same as other  medical expenses, and benefits
received under a long-term care  insurance policy would be tax-free (up to $175
per day).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Placing long-term care benefits on the same basis as health  care and
financing them under tax provisions similar to those for  medical insurance
could lead to substantial savings for state and  federal programs supporting
nursing home care.

<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>6. Accelerated Payment of Life Insurance Benefits for the  Terminally
Ill.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under current law, life insurance benefits are not taxed, but  insured
individuals and their families have no way to obtain  benefits prior to death
without a severe income tax liability  even  though many insurance companies are
willing to offer such  &quot;accelerated 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  benefits.&quot;  The BBA tax cut
plan would facilitate the practice  by which some insurance providers pay
benefits prior to death if  the insured person is terminally or chronically ill.
The plan would  allow such payments to be excluded from a taxpayer's gross 
income, just as payments to a surviving beneficiary now are. In addition,  it
would allow similar tax-exempt treatment for amounts  received from the sale or
assignment of a life insurance contract to a  qualified settlement provider.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>7. Reduction in Capital Gains Tax.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S. tax code punishes capital investment by taxing  investment income
more than once: twice by taxing corporate and  individual income, and then a
third time by taxing capital gains.  The current maximum tax rate on capital
gains is 28 percent for  individuals and 35 percent for corporations, and these
gains are  not indexed to the inflation rate. By contrast, most of America's 
major economic competitors, such as Japan or Germany, either  exempt capital
gains from taxation or tax them at a greatly reduced  rate, often indexing the
basis of the gains to inflation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The BBA lessens this penalty in two ways. First, it lowers the  effective
maximum capital gains rate to 19.8 percent for  individuals and 28 percent for
corporations. Second, starting January 1,  2001, it permits individuals to index
the value of assets to ensure  that they are not being taxed on purely
inflationary gains. The bill  also includes a 14 percent maximum rate for the
sale of small  business stock by a taxpayer other than a corporation. A
qualifying  small business may not have gross assets of more than $50 million at
 the time the stock is issued. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As will be seen below, these measures would have a  substantial impact on
the long-term growth of the economy while the  budget is being balanced.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>8. New Individual Retirement Accounts.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition to Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), the bill  offers
another way for taxpayers to preserve the value of this  retirement savings by
creating a new American Dream IRA (AD  IRA). Contributions would be made from
post-tax income, but the  interest from such savings would not be taxed upon
withdrawal if  contributions have remained in the account for at least five
years  and the retiree has reached age 59 1/2. This is why the  American Dream
Savings account is sometimes known as a  &quot;back-ended&quot; IRA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Initially, contributions to the new ADS account would be  limited to $2,000
per taxpayer per year ($4,000 for a married couple),  but this amount would be
indexed to the rate of inflation in  subsequent years. The plan also allows
penalty-free withdrawals for a  first-time home purchase or to pay certain
educational or medical  expenses.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>9. Alternative Minimum Tax. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Current tax law imposes an alternative minimum tax (AMT)  on certain
individuals and corporations whose tax liability, after  deductions and credits,
falls below the level specified by the  alternative minimum tax rate. For
individuals, the minimum tax is  im
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  posed at graduated rates of 26
and 28 percent; for corporations,  it is imposed at 20 percent. In computing
their AMT, individuals  and corporations must adjust the annual amount they
deduct for  depreciated assets so that their tax liability does not fall below
the  AMT amount. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The bill modifies the AMT for both individual and corporate  taxpayers by
repealing the depreciation adjustment for  property placed in service after
1995, thereby conforming AMT  depreciation methods with the method used for
regular tax  purposes. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#11">11</A></B></TT>

<P><B>10. Estate and Gift Tax Reform
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The BBA makes several important changes in the estate and  gift tax code to
reduce the punishing effects of this tax on estates,  especially the estates of
small businesses and farms. The bill  gradually increases the current effective
exemption of $600,000  to $750,000 in $25,000 increments through 2001, after
which  the effective exemption amount is indexed to inflation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For the estates of small businesses, which do not have special  tax rules,
the bil effectively excludes an amount equal to $1.75  million of the business's
value from the decedent's  estate. <TT><B><A

<P><B>Economic Benefits of the Tax Cuts</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Washington insiders, especially those within the White House  and some in
Congress, argued throughout 1995 that cutting taxes  was inconsistent with the
goal of balancing the budget. They  claimed, for instance, that Washington &quot;could
not afford&quot; to reduce  taxes 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  while so much spending was being
cut to balance the  budget. These criticisms ignore the economic benefits that
would be  realized from combining tax cuts with a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To demonstrate this point, economists at The Heritage  Foundation used one
of the principal econometric models of the U.S.  economy to project the economic
effects of the tax cut elements of the  Balanced Budget Act. This analysis
showed that:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The Balanced Budget Act with tax

<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The reduction in taxes on capital (including
capital gains tax  relief) accounts for $86.3 billion of this additional GDP and

<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     Many individual industries would benefit. For
example, a  balanced budget with tax cuts would result in the production of an

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>While balancing the budget is good for long-term  economic growth, even more
growth is generated by the tax cuts in the  Balanced Budget Act. The tax cuts on
family income  primarily  the $500-per-child tax credit  would allow more
households to  save or spend their hard-earned money instead of sending it to 
Wash
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  ington, and this increased
private savings and spending would  help offset reductions in government
spending. In the long run,  increased private-sector activity with less
government  spending means a more efficient economy, more well-paying jobs, and 
a lower rate of inflation.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>During the early years of any reduction in government  spending, the economy
must adjust to a lower level of government  intervention. Businesses that
previously produced goods and services  for the government now must produce for
the private sector,  and workers previously employed by the government must find
 new jobs in the private sector. Analogously, there must be a  transition in
savings and investment. Money that would have been  invested in United States
bonds must be re-directed toward  private-sector securities, bonds, or other
vehicles. The transition from  government spending to private savings and
spending is necessary  and valuable, but it also takes time. In the short term,
returning  money to the private sector by means of the $500-per-child tax credit
 will help to offset these negative effects.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The tax cuts on capital income  especially the capital gains  tax reductions
 are necessary to ensure a stronger economy.  There are two reasons for this:
First, reducing the tax on capital  gains lowers the cost of moving an
investment from an average  company to one that is exceptionally productive and
well-run. This  lowering of the &quot;switching&quot; costs means that investors
will play a larger  role in promoting well-run, productive companies. Thus, the 
economy as a whole is likely to be more efficient. Second, lower taxes  on
capital cause the cost of capital to fall. Lenders, for example,  do not need to
charge quite as much interest on capital loans to  recoup the taxes they paid
when making the capital available to a  bor
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  rower. Lower capital costs
usually mean more investment by  businesses in labor-saving equipment, which
commonly results in  increased labor productivity. This increased productivity 
translates into higher wages and, through the division of labor, more jobs.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Individual Benefits of the Tax Cuts</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As the 1995-1996 budget debate wore on, the &quot;green  eyeshade&quot;
negotiations over how to balance the budget overshadowed  the benefits of tax
cuts to families and individual taxpayers.  President Clinton often charged that
the $245 billion tax cut package  was &quot;extreme,&quot; given how much
spending had to be reduced in order  to balance the budget. But the plan
actually is relatively modest:  It amounts to returning just 2 cents of every
dollar of the $11.5  trillion the federal government expects to collect in tax
revenues  over the next seven years. At the same time, the Washington elite 
often dismissed the $500-per-child tax cut as insignificant. For  most
hard-working American families, however, $500 is not only a  significant amount
of money, but could mean the difference  between paying and not paying the
mortgage.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For instance, the $500-per-child tax credit would eliminate  100 percent of
the income tax liability for families of four earning  up to $24,000 a year and
more than 50 percent of the income tax  liability for a family of four earning
$30,000 a year.  Moreover, while $500 may buy only a hammer in Washington, it
would  buy much more for the average family with two children. For  example, the
$500-per-child tax credit would cover any of the  following expenses for an
average family with two children:

<P>Critics of the tax cut package claim that spending on education  and medical
security for the elderly would have to be compromised  to &quot;pay&quot; for
the tax cut. This short-sighted view ignores the  benefits that flow from
allowing families and retirees to keep and  spend their own money. It is the
view of those who cannot imagine  solving a problem without a government program
or handout.  However, consider the following:

enactment of a flat tax.

<P>Americans are suffering from an income tax system that  punishes hard work,
penalizes thrift, and retards investment. To make  matters worse, the payroll

<P>Each of the income tax code's many shortcomings can be  addressed by

existing system with a flat tax. Whether the goal  is to address the major flaws
outlined earlier in this chapter or to  fix

specific problems, the flat  tax does the job.

<P>

<P>There have been many flat tax proposals over the years, but  they all share
certain key features. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>One low tax rate -</B> All flat tax proposals have a single
tax rate  that applies to all income subject to tax. The actual rate imposed 
varies, but the upper limit would be about 20 percent. The  Armey/Shelby flat
tax legislation, for instance, begins with a 20 percent  rate which phases down
to 17 percent after a couple of years.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Elimination of deductions, credits, and exemptions -</B>
All pure  flat tax proposals eliminate provisions of the tax code that bestow 
preferential tax treatment on certain behaviors and activities.  Included in
this would be special tax breaks for businesses and  corporations and, for
individual taxpayers, the home mortgage interest  deduction, the charitable
contributions deduction, and the state and  local income and property tax
deductions. The combination of no  preferences, one low rate, and a generous
family allowance would  allow taxpayers to file their tax returns on a
postcard-size form.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>One-time taxation of income  -</B> Flat tax proposals are designed  to
eliminate the tax code's bias against capital formation by  ending the double
(and sometimes triple and quadruple) taxation of  income generated through
savings and investment. This is  achieved by ensuring that all income,
regardless of how it is earned or  how it is spent, is treated equally. Several
important tax policy  decisions flow from this principle, including repeal of
the estate  and gift tax, elimination of the double taxation of capital gains 
and dividend income, and neutral treatment of savings, either  through

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Faster economic growth -</B> A flat tax would spur
increased  work, saving, and investment. According to many economists, the rise 
in productive behavior would likely add one percentage point to  the annual rate
of economic growth. How significant is this?  An  increase in the growth rate of
just one-half of one percentage  point would boost an average family of four's
yearly income by  more than $5,000 after ten years.

<P><B>Instant wealth creation -</B> The value of financial assets is 
determined by the after-tax income they generate over time. By  eliminating the
second, third, and fourth layers of taxation on  capital income, a flat tax
therefore would significantly boost the value  of all income-producing assets.

of today's tax code.

<P>In addition to rescuing Americans' retirement income, this  package also
would solve one of the major economic problems of  the current system  its
negative effect on savings. Because  taxpayers are under the illusion that the
government will take care of  their retirement, they have reduced their savings
significantly.  This means fewer resources with which to finance future 
economic growth. Lower levels of saving mean less money for consumers  to borrow
to buy cars and fewer funds available to families looking  to buy their first
home. Perhaps most important, a low level of  savings means that businesses and
entrepreneurs will not have  as much access to the capital they need to invest
in the future  productivity  and wages  of American workers.

<P><B>Q. How much faster will the economy grow with a flat tax?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Estimates vary, but reliable projections indicate the  economy's
growth rate will be somewhere between one-half of one  percent and one percent
higher for several years following the  enactment of a flat tax. What does this
mean?  If the economy grows just  one-half of one percent faster each year, the
average family of four  will enjoy more than $5,000 of additional income by the
tenth year.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Will the elimination of the home mortgage interest  deduction hurt
the housing industry?
</B></P>
<P>
</P> 
<P><B>A.</B> Washington lobbyists representing real estate agents paid a 
consulting group to do a study of the flat tax. Not surprisingly,  the
consulting group concluded that a flat tax would lower  housing values by 15
percent. Independent research, however, has  found 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 -->  this result to be completely
unfounded. Indeed, if the itemized  deduction is so critical, why did the
housing market do so well in  the 1980s when lower tax rates increased the
after-tax cost of  home mortgage interest payments by as much as 135 percent? 
As  the above <a href="tax_14.gif">chart</a> illustrates, there appears to be no correlation  whatsoever
between the value of the itemized reduction and either  home sales or home
values. Instead, the key to strong real estate  markets is a growing economy.
This is why realtors, homebuilders,  and homeowners will benefit from a flat
tax.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Would charities be harmed if the charitable contributions  deduction
was eliminated?</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> As is the case with housing, the evidence from the  1980s clearly
shows that charities have nothing to fear from a flat  tax. The graphs
demonstrate that charitable contributions more  than doubled during the 1980s
even though the tax benefit of giving  fell sharply. Likewise, the numbers show
that charitable giving  rises with income; thus, since a flat tax will boost
income, charities  will benefit.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Are there any groups that would pay more under a flat tax?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The flat tax is not a free lunch. Aggressive users of tax 
shelters could face higher tax bills. Wealthy wage earners who create  business
losses to cancel out their tax liabilities will lose that  gimmick under a flat
tax. Many businesses could see their tax bills go up  as well. Needless to say,
the political prospects for a flat tax  increase to the extent that the number
of &quot;losers&quot; is minimized. This is  a strong argument for maximizing
the size of the tax cut that  accompanies tax reform.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do some opponents say dividends and interest would  not be taxed
with a flat tax?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Probably because they do not understand how the  proposal works.
Under the flat tax, capital income is taxed at the  business level. What changes
is that corporate profits are no longer  subject to a second layer of tax at the
individual level. In a flat tax  system, a dividend check becomes analogous to a
worker's paycheck   an amount of money left after taxes already have been paid. 
Similarly, interest income is taxed by making it non-deductible to  the
borrower. A company with $1 million in interest payments,  for instance, would
pay $170,000 in taxes on that amount. To tax  this income a second time by
including it in the taxable income of  the recipient would be double taxation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What happens to the capital gains tax?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Like all other provisions which double or triple tax income,  the
capital gains tax disappears. Individual taxpayers who buy  assets have paid
taxes on that income already. Whether that asset goes  up or down in value after
the purchase does not matter, since the  tax already has been paid. Businesses,
because they are able to  deduct the cost of purchasing assets, would pay tax on
asset sales.  This taxes the capital gain (if any exists), but avoids double
taxation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Will the estate tax disappear with a flat tax?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Estate and gift taxes are one of the clearest examples of  double
and triple taxation in the current tax code and will be  eliminated under the
flat tax. In addition to protecting the taxpayer from  hav
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 -->  ing to pay additional taxes on
income that already has been  taxed, abolishing the estate tax prevents family
businesses and  farms from being sold off for tax purposes. Another argument for
 elimination is that the estate tax drains private capital from the  economy
that is needed to finance future economic growth.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What happens to the IRS?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No tax reform proposal will eliminate the IRS. As long as  the
government intends to claim $1.4 trillion of tax revenue,  some level of tax
collection authority will be required. By radically  simplifying the tax code
and eliminating the provisions that cause  the most conflict (alternative
minimum tax, depreciation,  capital gains, itemized deductions, etc.), the flat
tax will significantly  reduce IRS abuses. For individual taxpayers, the only
things the  IRS will be able to question are total income and number of
children.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Will a flat tax encourage job creation?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> A flat tax will encourage more jobs and higher wages by  boosting
incentives to work, save, and invest. In the long run, the  elimination of most
of the tax code's bias against savings and  investment will have the biggest
effect. As studies show, a flat tax  will encourage capital formation, leading
over time to higher levels  of productivity, increased wages, and more jobs. A
flat tax also  will have a more immediate impact on job creation, however, by 
making work more attractive. High tax rates drive a wedge  between what it costs
a business to employ a worker and how much  the worker receives in take-home
pay. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#15">15</A></B></TT>  By
increasing the cost  of labor, taxes lower the number of workers a company is
willing  to hire. Businesses do not exist to pay workers more than they  are 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 46 -->  worth. They exist to make money
and will hire only as long as  the value of each new worker's additional output
exceeds the total  cost of employing that worker.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>When politicians enact policies that raise the cost of  employment, the
total cost of some workers will rise above the value they  bring their
employers. In the long run, a business has only two  options when faced with
this predicament: close its doors or lay off  workers who are net money losers.
Even workers who retain their  jobs pay a price. Taxes on labor income, whether
paid by employee  or employer, dollar for dollar, unavoidably reduce the amount 
that finds its way into their paychecks. Politicians may pretend  otherwise, but
every time the tax burden climbs, workers' after-tax  income declines. <TT><B><A

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Would a flat tax reduce the budget deficit?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> This depends on which flat tax is implemented. More 
specifically, it depends on the tax rate and whether the proposal  includes
limits on government spending. Even though lower rates  generally stimulate
economic growth and expand the tax base, at some  point they translate into less
revenue. A flat tax of 20 percent, for  instance, almost certainly would raise
more money than a flat tax  of 10 percent. The size of the personal
exemption/family  allowance also plays a key role, since the decision to protect
a certain  amount of income ($36,800 for a family of four in last year's Armey 
bill) generally means the rate on taxable income must be higher.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to a Treasury Department analysis leaked to the  media before the
1994 elections, the Administration estimates that  the Armey flat tax would
result in a $244 billion revenue loss to  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 -->  federal government in 1995. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#17">17</A></B></TT>  But this study contained
a  $500 billion error, as the Department later  admitted, <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#18">18</A></B></TT> and used the 17 percent
rate to analyze 1995 revenues even though the Armey  bill calls explicitly for
an initial rate of 20 percent (which would  be phased down to 17 percent). The
Treasury Department now  claims that, once fully phased in, the Armey flat tax
would &quot;cost&quot;  the government as much as $186 billion per year. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#19">19</A></B></TT> Because it  is based on
static analysis, however, this figure assumes that  reduced tax rates and
simplification would have no positive effect on  the economy. Hence, it ignores
the additional revenues produced  by income growth (as well as the binding caps
on federal  spending that the Armey bill would impose). <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#20">20</A>
</B></TT></P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>A flat tax almost certainly would reduce long-term  government borrowing
since its reduced rates and lower taxes on savings  and investment would boost
economic growth. Each year, the  result would be an expanding tax base and at
least some reduction  in outlays for certain means-tested programs and the 
unemployment compensation system. According to one relatively modest  estimate
of supply-side impact, a flat tax would increase the  economy's long-run annual
growth rate by just 0.5 percent. By the tenth  year, national economic output
would be $578 billion higher than  it would have been without a flat tax. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#21">21</A>
</B></TT> Government's &quot;share&quot;  of this production of additional goods
and services would be $86  billion in tax revenue. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#22">22</A></B></TT>  By the twentieth year,
added growth of  0.5 percent would mean an increase of more than $2 trillion in 
GDP and additional tax revenues in excess of $300 billion.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The revenue feedback from higher growth, however,  probably would not be
enough in the short term to offset the revenue  lost from lower tax rates and
elimination of the multiple taxation  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 -->  capital income. Achieving a
deficit-neutral flat tax (at least  the Armey version) would require some
restraints on  government spending. And if lawmakers were forced to balance the
budget  by 2002, the limit on spending increases would have to be even  more
stringent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What would happen to the price of other assets?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> While the potentially negative impact on housing markets  and
charity appears negligible, the positive impact on  income-producing assets
would be large. Assets such as stocks, bonds, and  rental properties produce a
stream of income over time. Their  market price is determined by calculating how
much income an asset  will produce over time, after taxes, adjusted to reflect
the fact that  income today is worth more than the same amount of nominal 
income in the future. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#23">23</A></B></TT>
 By lowering tax rates and removing  the double and sometimes triple taxation of
capital income, a flat  tax can increase dramatically the after-tax income
stream an asset  will generate. Thus, a low-rate flat tax would be a boon to
asset  holders, offsetting any theoretical fall in housing prices, and  would
stimulate a surge of new investment in the economy. Harvard  professor and tax
economist Dale Jorgenson estimates that a flat  tax would increase national
wealth by $1  trillion. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#24">24</A></B></TT>
 While this may seem high, it should be remembered that the mere  announcement
in Israel that a capital gains tax was being imposed caused the  Israeli stock
market to drop by 10 percent in just one  day.<TT><B>
<A HREF="ftnt2.htm#25">25</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Would a flat tax benefit everybody?
</B></P>
<P>
</P> 
<P><B>A.</B> If the question is considered narrowly (will anyone's tax  bill
rise?) it depends on how a flat tax is structured. If it is designed  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  give the government as much money
as it receives under the  current system, and if there is no consideration of
the increased  revenue that would accrue from new job creation and higher 
economic growth, then it is impossible to avoid having winners  and losers. In
the long run, a flat tax presumably would generate  higher incomes and living
standards, raising after-tax income even  for those who suffered a short-term
tax increase. At the same time,  it doubtless would have an adverse impact on
the lawyers,  accountants, and lobbyists who profit from the current law's
complexity.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many flat tax proposals are structured so that few taxpayers,  if any, would
have higher tax bills. This is because they are  designed to go beyond
simplification and rate reduction to include  significant tax cuts for the
American economy. The Armey plan is  a good example. Using static estimating
techniques, it  probably would save taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars
over a  five-year period. While the combination of a 17 percent tax rate  and
generous family exemption would not necessarily guarantee  lower tax bills for
everyone, few would face higher taxes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Is there a way to stop politicians from raising tax rates in  the
future?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> There is no guarantee that a future Congress would not turn  a
simple flat tax back into a complicated &quot;progressive&quot; tax. This  is
the Achilles' Heel of tax reform. The sweeping reform enacted  in 1986 expanded
the tax base by eliminating many deductions  while simultaneously reducing tax
rates to keep the total tax burden  from climbing. Skeptics warned that
politicians could not be trusted  to honor this arrangement and that eventually
they would raise  rates while failing to restore deductions. This is exactly
what  happened 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  under Presidents Bush and
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Could this happen with a flat tax?  Using the promise of low  tax rates,
could politicians take away the home mortgage interest  deduction, the
charitable contributions deduction, and other tax  preferences but then raise
tax rates in the future?  It is to reduce  this danger that most proponents of a
flat tax include an ironclad  provision to make raising tax rates difficult or
impossible. One way  to accomplish this would be by amending the Constitution to
 require that no increase in tax rates can be approved without the votes  of at
least three-fifths or two-thirds (in other words, a  &quot;super-majority&quot;)
of both the House and  Senate. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#26">26</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Should the income tax be abolished instead?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Proponents of a flat tax note that the current &quot;progressive&quot;
 income tax penalizes growth, discourages savings and  investment, imposes heavy
compliance costs, destroys jobs, and  reduces America's international
competitiveness. It has been pointed  out, moreover, that a flat rate income tax
reduces but does not  eliminate these negative effects. Thus, the question for
some  becomes whether it would be better to replace the income tax with a sales 
or &quot;consumption&quot; tax. Proponents of this view, including  House Ways
and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-TX)  and Senator Richard Lugar
(R-IN), usually suggest that the  foregone revenue could be offset by spending
cuts, consumption taxes,  or some combination of the two.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Most advocates of a flat tax recognize that this argument is  sound, at
least in theory. Abolishing the income tax, closing down  the Internal Revenue
Service, and repealing the 16th  Amendment 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 -->  clearly would be in the national
interest. Eliminating the  income tax would lead to even more economic growth
and job  creation than would occur under a flat tax. The real question is how 
that goal can be achieved.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Supporters of the flat tax have decided that eliminating the  income tax is
unlikely, especially in the short run. Because so many  interest groups benefit
from the current tax system, enacting a flat  tax will be difficult by itself.
Moreover, there is some concern  that proposals to abolish the income tax could
play into the hands  of those who want a national sales tax, or value added tax
(VAT),  as an add-on tax. If implemented as a replacement for the income  tax,
either of these would be less destructive to the economy. The  experiences of
other countries, however, suggest that, while a  VAT would be implemented with
the promise to eliminate other  taxes, politicians would never take that second
step. The country  then would have the worst of both worlds: income and direct 
consumption taxes. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#27">27</A> 
</B></TT>In any event, enacting a flat tax is probably  necessary as an interim
measure for those who favor eliminating the  income tax.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Would a flat tax eliminate the marriage penalty?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Probably, but it depends on how the flat tax is structured.  The
marriage penalty refers to the increased tax faced by a  married couple compared
to two single people with similar incomes.  This penalty is most severe for
couples with similar earnings. A flat  tax automatically solves part of this
problem by making it no  longer possible for one spouse's income to push a
couple into a higher  tax bracket. But the marriage penalty also arises if the
personal  exemption for a married couple is not twice the size of the  exemption

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 52 -->  for those filing singly. The
Armey proposal solves this part of  the problem by giving a married couple twice
the exemption of  a single filer. Nevertheless, a flat tax could be constructed
that  retains this penalty.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How would a flat tax affect business and payroll taxes?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> It would be possible to reform the personal income tax 
dramatically while leaving the corporate income tax untouched. As  mentioned
earlier, many businesses file using the personal tax code,  so many of their
problems would be solved by a flat tax that left  the corporate tax code
untouched. All flat taxes based on the  Hall/Rabushka model, however, reform
both the personal and  corporate income tax codes. Under the Armey proposal, for
instance,  the business rate would fall to 17 percent, the same as the  personal
rate, and the code would be reformed to eliminate the excess  taxation of
capital.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A flat tax can be designed to include substantial reform of  Social Security
and Medicare payroll taxes. Under current law,  payroll taxes totaling 15.3
percent are levied on the first $61,600 of  income (7.65 percent each from
employer and employee,  though economists agree that the entire tax is borne by
the  worker). <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#28">28</A></B></TT>
 Although none has reached legislative form, some flat tax plans  incorporate
the payroll tax, making the total marginal tax rate a  fixed percentage
regardless of income.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Would a flat tax help America compete?
</B></P>
<P>
</P> 
<P><B>A.</B> The historic tax rate reductions launched by Ronald Reagan  in
the 1980s caused a chain reaction around the world. Many  nations 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 53 -->  followed America's example and
have made similarly  dramatic reductions in marginal tax rates in recent years.
In large part,  this worldwide shift in tax policy was driven by competition as 
investors avoided nations with high tax rates. Unfortunately,  America seems to
be one of the few nations that have not learned from  the experience of the
1980s. While the rest of the world has been  cutting taxes, the United States
stands alone as the only major  nation to impose sharply higher tax rates in
recent years. Investors  have reacted accordingly, and the amount of new
investment in  American jobs and business from overseas has dropped from an 
average of $175 billion per year during the low tax years of the 1980s to  an
average of only $108 billion in 1990. <TT><B><A

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What happens to capital gains taxes and estate taxes under a  flat
tax?</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> They are all eliminated. One of the key principles of a flat tax 
is that income is taxed only once. A capital gain for a financial  asset is
simply a reflection that the market's expectation of the  after-tax streams of
income from that asset has risen. Under a flat tax,  that income is taxed at the
business level when it is realized. To tax  the capital gain is double taxation.
Similarly, the estate tax is a  second layer of tax on earning which, under the
current system,  already has been taxed at least once.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under the leadership of President Ronald Reagan, the 1980s were "the most prosperous decade in American history. That means the vast majority of Americans lived at a higher standard of living than they, or anyone else, ever had before, anywhere on the globe."<sup>1</sup>  Yet critics in the media and elsewhere persist in spreading such myths as the notion that the 1980s were a "decade of greed" in which the rich got richer and the poor got poorer.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Imagine what they would have said if the economic policy of the Reagan Administration had been a failure.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ronald Reagan did more than engineer sweeping economic policy changes that produced the longest peacetime economic boom in American history. He inherited an economic crisis of disastrous proportions that had been developing for over a decade and, in just a few years, reversed it to produce an economic triumph:<blockquote>

	Lest we forget, in 1979 the world stood on an economic precipice. Inflation ran 13.5 percent in 1980, real production dipped and the prime rate reached 21.5 percent. And economics as conventionally understood provided no intellectual tools for understanding this crisis, let alone curbing it. Worse, the affliction had struck the whole world, and threatened more damage to come.<sup>2</sup></blockquote><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the late 1970s, few believed the persistent inflation that had been building for more than ten years could be stopped, or at least stopped without creating another depression. Interest rates were at a crisis level, unemployment was rising, real incomes were falling, poverty was rising, productivity was stagnant, real economic growth had ceased, and both the dollar and the stock market were on the verge of collapse.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Reagan reversed each and every one of these trends. How did he do it?  The Reagan economic policy consisted of four basic components:
<ul>
<p><li>Deep across-the-board tax cuts.

<p><li>Across-the-board domestic spending cuts.

<p><li>Deregulation.

<p><li>Sound monetary policies to restrain inflation.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Reagan implemented these policies quickly, and the results were the largest peacetime economic boom in American history and nearly 20 million new jobs. To listen to many in the press today, however, it was a time of misery. The liberal establishment could not abide Reagan's policies of allowing people to keep more of their own money through real tax cuts and generally shifting power from the government to the people, so they have set out to tell us why the boom was a bust and the greatest of successes the greatest of failures.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This is hardly surprising. Liberals must attack Reagan's success if they are to build popular support for higher taxes, more regulation, and higher government spending. But their attack can be countered. The following pages provide the evidence, point by point, with which conservative candidates can refute this attempt to rewrite history.
<p>

<b>What Happened to Federal Revenues?</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There has been a great deal of rhetoric about Reagan tax cuts draining the federal Treasury. The reality is that revenues increased significantly.
<ul>
<p><li>Total federal revenues doubled, rising from $517.1 billion in 1980 to $1,031.3 billion, or just over $1 trillion, in 1990. In constant inflation-adjusted dollars, this was an increase of 26 percent.

<p><li>As a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), federal revenues declined only slightly, from 19.6 percent in 1980 to 18.8 percent in 1990 (see <a href="1980st1.gif">Table 1</a>).

<p><li>Revenues from individual income taxes climbed from $244.1 billion in 1980 to $466.9 billion in 1990 (see <a href="1980st1.gif">Table 1</a>). In inflation-adjusted dollars, this amounted to an increase of about 25 percent.
</ul>

<p>
<b>What Happened to Federal Spending?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Much also is made of the Reagan budget cuts, but the truth is that federal spending also rose significantly during the 1980s.
<ul>
<p><li>Federal spending more than doubled, growing from $590.9 billion in 1980 to $1,252.7 billion, or $1.25 trillion, in 1990 (see <a href="1980st2.gif">Table 2</a>). In constant inflation-adjusted dollars, this was an increase of 33.4 percent.

<p><li>As a percentage of GDP, federal expenditures grew slightly, climbing from 22.3 percent in 1980 to 22.9 percent in 1990 (see <a href="1980st2.gif">Table 2</a>).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As discussed in detail in Chapter 7, government spending to aid the poor also climbed steeply throughout the 1980s and is now at record levels by every measure. The same is true of education, discussed in detail in Chapter 9.

<p>
<b>What Happened to Federal Deficits?</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With federal revenues doubling in the 1980s, the cause of the deficit during that period is clear: runaway federal spending, which more than doubled (see <a href="1980st2.gif">Table 2</a>). Federal taxes in 1990 amounted to about 19 percent of GDP, which is approximately where they had been for 40 years, since the early 1950s. Federal spending in 1990 was about 23 percent of GDP, having fluctuated around 19 percent to 20 percent of GDP during most of the postwar era until the late 1970s. During the 1980s, taxes were maintained at historic levels as spending surpassed well-established historic levels, creating the deficit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In Reagan's last budget year, however, the federal deficit actually had been <i>reduced</i> to $152.5 billion (see <a href="1980st3.gif">Table 3</a>). As a percentage of GDP, this was about the same as the deficit for 1980.<ul>

<p><li>The deficit in fiscal 1989 was 2.9 percent of GDP, compared to 2.8 percent in 1980. Reagan had cut the deficit as a percentage of GDP by more than half from 1983, when it was 6.3 percent.

<p><li>This was accomplished by reducing federal spending from over 24 percent of GDP to about 22 percent of GDP. The problem is that federal spending started to escalate again after Reagan left office. By 1992, the deficit had leaped to a record $290.4 billion, about one-third higher than its highest level under Reagan.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Total federal debt held by the public was 44 percent of GDP in 1990 (see <a href="1980st5.gif">Table 5</a>). This was the same level as in 1940 during the liberal-supported New Deal. It was also less than publicly held federal debt as a percentage of GDP during the Kennedy Administration in the early 1960s. Publicly held debt totaled 113.8 percent of GDP in 1946, as a result of World War II, and remained higher than the peak achieved during the Reagan years until 1964; but it did not prevent an American economic boom during the postwar period.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Critics have argued that the 1980s deficits were financed by a massive influx of foreign investment which bought up federal debt and left America vulnerable to economic calamity if foreign investors decided to withdraw. In fact, foreign interests held 16.7 percent of public federal debt at the end of fiscal 1990, compared to 17.5 percent at the end of fiscal 1980.<sup>3</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another perspective is gained by comparing U.S. budget deficits in the 1980s with the average budget deficits in the same years for the seven leading industrial countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Calculating deficits as a percentage of GDP for all levels of government within each country, the OECD reports that the total U.S. government deficit (federal, state, and local) was close to the average deficit as a percentage of GDP for all of the G-7 countries throughout the Reagan years (see <a href="1980st6.gif">Table 6</a>).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Finally, interest rates fell sharply and consistently throughout the Reagan years despite deficits, as shown below. The academic literature shows no correlation between federal budget deficits and interest rates.<sup>4</sup>  By 1992, when the federal deficit hit a record $290.4 billion, interest rates were at their lowest levels since before 1980 (see <a href="1980st10.gif">Table 10</a>).
<p>

<b>What Happened to Inflation?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many Americans seem to have forgotten that inflation threatened the very foundations of the economy in 1980. Inflation soared during the late 1970s, reaching 11.3 percent in 1979 and 13.5 percent in 1980 -- a 25 percent rise in prices in just two years (see <a href="1980st7.gif">Table 7</a>). Many experts doubted that this problem, which had been gathering steam since the mid-1960s, could be cured without causing a deep recession or even a depression. Others doubted that it could be cured at all.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives argued that this inflation was caused by loose, "easy money" Federal Reserve policies which allowed the money supply to grow too rapidly. Thus, a central plank of the Reagan economic platform was a restrained monetary policy that would hold growth in the money supply to the level necessary to maintain real economic growth. Reagan pursued this policy vigorously and faithfully. The result: inflation was reduced by more than half, to 6.2 percent, by 1982 (see <a href="1980st7.gif">Table 7</a>), dropping to 3.2 percent in 1983 and remaining near that level for the rest of Reagan's term.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To this day, the inflation problem that seemed so threatening and unsolvable 15 years ago has not returned, but this overwhelmingly important achievement somehow has been all but forgotten in the debate over Reagan's economic policies and the 1980s.
<p>

<b>What Happened to Economic Growth?</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By 1983, despite a steep recession in 1982 caused by the tight money policies needed to squeeze out the historic inflation level of the late 1970s, the Reagan policies of reduced taxes, spending, regulation, and inflation were in place. The result was an economic boom.
<ul>
<p><li>This boom lasted 92 months without a recession, from November 1982 to July 1990, the longest period of sustained peacetime growth in U.S. history and the second-longest period of sustained growth, including even wartime. It was also more than twice the average period of expansions since World War II.<sup>5</sup><p><li>The American economy grew by about one-third in real inflation-adjusted terms. This was the equivalent of adding the entire economy of Germany, East and West, or two-thirds of the economy of Japan, to the U.S. economy.<sup>6</sup><p><li>From 1950 to 1973, real economic growth in the U.S. economy averaged 3.6 percent per year. From 1973 to 1982, it averaged only 1.6 percent. The Reagan economic boom restored the more usual growth rate as the economy averaged 3.5 percent in real growth from the beginning of 1983 to the end of 1990.<sup>7</sup></ul><p><b>What Happened to Jobs?</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A central feature of the 1980s was a boom in jobs and employment. The figures are impressive.<ul><p><li>From 1980 to 1990, 18.6 million new jobs were created, increasing U.S. civilian employment by almost 20 percent. Almost 23 percent -- about 4.2 million -- of these jobs went to black workers.<sup>8</sup>

<p><li>By 1989, unemployment for the year had fallen to 5.3 percent, the lowest since 1973 and down from 7.1 percent in 1980 (see <a href="1980st8.gif">Table 8</a>).

<p><li>In 1989, labor force participation reached a record 66.5 percent, and a record 63 percent of the population was employed. Black labor force participation also hit a record 64.2 percent in 1989, with female labor force participation reaching an all-time record of 57.5 percent in 1990.<sup>9</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition, contrary to the myth makers' claims, most jobs created during the 1980s were good jobs.
<ul>
<p><li>About 82 percent were in the higher-paying, higher-skilled (technical, precision production, managerial and professional) occupations. Only 12 percent were in the lowest-paid, low-skilled service occupations, such as retailing and fast-food restaurants.<sup>10</sup><p><li>Data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that during Ronald Reagan's first term, 48.7 percent of new jobs were in the best-paid managerial and professional category.<sup>11</sup>  This trend continued into his second term.</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This represented a dramatic turnaround from the Carter years, when most new jobs were low-paid (defined as under $7,000 per year) and the number of high-paid jobs (more than $28,000 per year) actually declined.<ul><p><li>From 1977 to 1980, 41.77 percent of the new jobs paid under $7,000 per year in real 1984 dollars, while the number of jobs paying over $28,000 per year declined by 10 percent (see <a href="1980st9.gif">Table 9</a>).

<p><li>During Reagan's first term, only 6 percent of the new jobs paid under $7,000 and 46.7 percent paid more than $28,000 per year, both in constant 1984 dollars (see <a href="1980st9.gif">Table 9</a>). This was also a dramatic improvement over the 1973-1977 Nixon/Ford term, when 37.6 percent of the new jobs were in the low-paid category and only 11.2 percent were in the high-paid category (see Table 9).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Critics often claim the period from 1979 to 1984 produced more lower-paying jobs, but this is misleading because it includes two terrible Carter years, 1979 and 1980. In the words of <i>The Washington Post</i> and <i>Newsweek</i> columnist Robert Samuelson, "Welcome to Economics Propaganda 101. The notion that the U.S. economy is producing mostly low-paying, unskilled jobs is an economic fiction."<sup>12</sup><p><b>What Happened to Interest Rates?</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;President Clinton likes to claim that he reduced interest rates to their lowest levels in 15 years. The truth is that they have been falling steadily ever since Ronald Reagan took office in 1981 (see <a href="1980st10.gif">Table 10</a>).
<ul>
<p><li><b>The prime rate</b> declined from an average of 18.87 percent in 1981 to 6.25 percent in 1992 and was down to 6 percent in December 1992 from a peak of 21.5 percent at the end of 1980.<sup>13</sup><p><li><b>New home mortgage rates</b> declined from an average of 14.7 percent in 1982 to 8.07 percent in November 1992.<p><li><b>AAA corporate bonds</b> declined from an average of 14.17 percent in 1981 to 8.14 percent in 1992. In December 1992, the yield dropped to 7.98 percent.

<p><li><b>The yield on new three-month Treasury bills</b> declined from an average of 14.029 percent in 1981 to 3.45 percent in 1992. In December 1992, it fell to 3.25 percent.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Clearly, today's low interest rates are a product of the Reagan and Bush years, not the Clinton years.

<p>
<b>What Happened to Incomes?</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Reagan economic boom also boosted family incomes across the board.
<ul>
<p><li><b>Real median family income</b>, adjusted for inflation, began to decline during the Carter years, falling almost 10 percent from 1978 to 1982. The Reagan recovery reversed this trend. Median family incomes started to rise again in 1983 and had increased by 11.3 percent by 1989.<sup>14</sup><p><li><b>Real average income</b> of U.S. households rose by 15.2 percent from 1980 to 1989, and by 16.8 percent from 1982 to 1989, compared to a 0.8 percent decline from 1970 to 1980.<sup>15</sup><p><LI><B>Real, per capita, disposable income</b> increased by 18 percent from 1982 to 1990. In other words, American living standards increased by almost 20 percent during the Reagan economic boom.<sup>16</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Critics often cite a decline in income from 1979 to 1989 among families in the lowest 20 percent of incomes. This, too, is thoroughly misleading. Average real household income for the bottom quintile declined by 14.2 percent from 1979 to 1983. The Reagan boom reversed this trend, increasing this group's average real income by 12.2 percent from 1983 to 1989. Average real income was still lower in 1989 than in 1979, but the problem was the precipitous decline in such incomes during the Carter years. Reagan engineered a major recovery in the lowest group's incomes (see <a href="1980st9.gif">Table 9</a>).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Real household incomes also rose for every other 20 percent of income distribution during the Reagan recovery from 1983 to 1989:
<ul>
<p><li>For the second-lowest quintile, by 10.1 percent.

<p><li>For the middle quintile, by 10.7 percent.

<p><LI>For the second-highest quintile, by 11.6 percent.

<p><li>For the highest quintile, by 18.8 percent.<sup>17</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Real incomes rose for every quintile from 1980 to 1989, and from 1980 to 1990 as well, but declined for every quintile during the Carter years from 1977 to 1980.<sup>18</sup>  A study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that real, per capita, before-tax income rose substantially for every quintile of income distribution from 1984 to 1989:
<ul>
<p><li>For the lowest quintile, by a stunning 68 percent.

<p><li>For the second-lowest quintile, by 18.7 percent.

<p><li>For the middle quintile, by 9 percent.

<p><li>For the second-highest quintile, by 12.1 percent.

<p><li>For the highest quintile, by 19.2 percent.<sup>19</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, there is broad movement of people among quintiles in income distribution over time. This is clearly demonstrated in a Treasury study which found that 85.8 percent of those in the bottom 20 percent of income distribution in 1979 had climbed to a higher quintile by 1988, and 65 percent had moved up at least 2 quintiles.
<ul>
<p><li>Only 14.2 percent remained in the bottom 20 percent, and 14.7 percent of those who were in the bottom 20 percent in 1979 were in the top 20 percent by 1988. Thus, people in the bottom quintile in 1979 were more likely to be in the top quintile than in the bottom quintile by 1988.

<p><li>60 percent of those in the second-lowest 20 percent in 1979 had moved into a higher quintile by 1988.

<p><li>Of those in the middle 20 percent in 1979, 47 percent had moved up to a higher-income quintile by 1988 while fewer than 20 percent had moved down to a lower quintile.

<p><li>By contrast, a third of those in the top 20 percent in 1979 had fallen to a lower-income quintile by 1988, and over half (52.7 percent) of those in the top 1 percent in 1979 had fallen to a lower-income category by 1988.<sup>20</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The results of another study by Isabel Sawhill and Mark Condon of the liberal Urban Institute are similarly instructive.<ul><p><li>The average family income of those who were in the lowest quintile of income distribution in 1977 had increased 77 percent in real inflation-adjusted terms by 1986 when many had moved to higher quintiles.<p><li>The average for those in the second-lowest quintile in 1977 had increased 37 percent in real terms by 1986.

<p><li>The average for those in the middle quintile in 1977 had increased 20 percent in real terms by 1986.

<p><li>The average for those in the second-highest quintile in 1977 had increased only 10 percent in real terms by 1986.

<p><li>The average for those in the top quintile in 1977 had increased only 5 percent in real terms by 1986.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

According to Sawhill and Condon, "when one follows individuals instead of statistical groups defined by income, one finds that, on average, the rich got a little richer and the poor got much richer."  The reason:
<blockquote>
	People who start at the bottom have nowhere to move but up, and are likely to do so as they become older, gain more seniority, and earn higher incomes. People who start at the top, some of whom may be there because of temporary sources of income like capital gains, have nowhere to go but down. This pattern, however, may be surprising to the general public, which has been led to believe that the poor were literally getting poorer over the past decade or two, and that the incomes of the rich were skyrocketing. This is simply not true.<sup>21</sup></blockquote>A widely cited study by the Democrat-controlled Congressional Budget Office erroneously contended that the top 1 percent of income earners received 60 percent of the income gains in the 1980s, but this study was filled with faulty calculations.<ul><p><li>Capital gains income was not adjusted for inflation.<p><li>Most capital losses and partnership losses were not counted.

<p><li>Appreciation of pension fund assets and homes was not counted, understating the gains of the middle and working classes.

<p><li>Incomes of the bottom 60 percent of earners were substantially undercounted, compared to incomes for those groups reported by the Census Bureau.

<p><li>Families were assigned to income quintiles with an adjustment for family size, but incomes in the study were not adjusted for family size.

<p><li>Most shocking of all, using this same flawed methodology, the real era of greed would have been the Carter years of 1977-1980 when, calculating income distribution in the same way, 100 percent of the income gains went to the top 1 percent.<sup>22</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In his careful book <i>What Went Right in the 1980s</i>, on the other hand, University of California Professor Richard McKenzie presents the actual distribution of income gains based on data collected and reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. He shows the percentages of the increase in real, before-tax, per capita income actually earned by each quintile from 1984 to 1989:
<ul>
<p><li>For the lowest quintile, 15.4 percent.

<p><li>For the second-lowest quintile, 11.9 percent.

<p><li>For the middle quintile, 9.0 percent.

<p><li>For the second-highest quintile, 16.7 percent.

<p><li>For the highest quintile, 46.9 percent.<sup>23</sup><p></ul>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The impression conveyed by these Tables, which show that the top 20 percent earned less than 47 percent of the income gains, stands in stark contrast to the picture painted by the Congressional Budget Office, with its top 1 percent earning 60 percent of the gains.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Another widely cited article, "The Incredible Shrinking Middle Class," published in <i>American Demographics</i> for May 1992, argued that the middle class shrank in the 1980s as the number of families earning between $15,000 and $50,000 in constant 1990 dollars fell from 58 percent of all families in 1980 to under 53 percent in 1990. According to the article's own data, however, this occurred because the incomes of so many families grew above $50,000, not because middle-class incomes fell.
<ul>
<p><li>The percentage of families earning less than $15,000 in 1990 dollars fell from 17.5 in 1980 to 16.9 in 1990.

<p><li>The percentage of families earning more than $50,000 in 1990 dollars rose from 24.5 in 1980 to nearly 31 in 1990.

<p><li>During the 1970s, while the percentage of families earning $15,000 to $50,000 in constant dollars fell from 60.5 to 58, the percentage earning less than $15,000 rose from 16 to 17.5, while the percentage earning over $50,000 rose only from 23.5 to 24.5.<sup>24</sup></ul>Statistics on income growth for different percentages of the population will always show a somewhat larger income gain for the top group studied, whether it is 1, 5, 20, or some other percentage. There are two reasons for this.<ul><p><li>Income gains for the lower groups will be reduced because the fastest gainers from each group will climb to a higher group and be counted in that group's average incomes in later periods. For example, assume the income of a person in the bottom 20 percent rises from $5,000 in the first period to $20,000 in the second period. Because this puts him in the second-lowest quintile, his income will not be among those counted in the bottom quintile in the second period. Therefore, it cannot push up the bottom quintile's average for that period. On the other hand, all income gains for those in the top group will still be counted in that group's income in the second period, simply because there is no higher group into which the fastest income gainers can rise.

<p><li>Also, as incomes rise over time, the cut-off necessary to be in the top 1, 5, 20, or other percent will rise. This means the average income needed to qualify for the top group also will rise. For example, it may take $100,000 to be in the top 1 percent in the first year; in the second year, if the incomes of the next 9 percent rise rapidly during the year, it may take $110,000 to qualify for the top 1 percent. Many in the next 9 percent may climb over some in the top 1 percent to form a new top 1 percent with a higher average income.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Another device often used to distort income or other economic statistics for the 1980s is to include some of the Carter years or other bad years from the 1970s in the calculation. Periods cited may start with 1979, 1977, or even 1973. Shifting the starting point to years before 1981, when Ronald Reagan took office, lumps declining incomes or other declining economic performance from the 1970s with rising incomes or other economic performance from the Reagan years, leaving a distorted impression.

<p>
<b>What Happened to the Federal Tax Burden?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Probably the greatest myth about the 1980s is that Ronald Reagan slashed taxes dramatically for the rich, the result being that they no longer pay their fare share. The flaw in this claim is that it mixes tax rates with taxes actually paid and ignores the real trend of taxation.
<ul>
<p><li>In 1991 (the last year for which data are available), the top 1 percent of taxpayers in income paid 25 percent of all income taxes, the top 5 percent paid 43 percent, and the bottom 50 percent paid only 5 percent (see <a href="1980st11.gif">Table 11</a>). To suggest that this distribution is unfair because it is too easy on upper-income groups is nothing less than absurd.

<p><LI>The proportion of total income taxes paid by the top 1 percent rose sharply under Reagan from 18 percent in 1981 to 28 percent in 1988 (see Table 11).

<p><li>Average effective income tax rates were cut even more for lower-income groups than for higher-income groups. While the average effective tax rate for the top 1 percent fell by 30 percent between 1980 and 1992 -- and by 35 percent for the top 20 percent  of income earners -- it was reduced by 44 percent for the second-highest quintile, 46 percent for the middle quintile, 64 percent for the second-lowest quintile, and 263 percent for the bottom quintile (see <a href="1980st12.gif">Table 12</a>).

<p><li>The reductions for the lowest-income groups were so large because Reagan doubled the personal exemption, increased the standard deduction, and tripled the earned income tax credit (EITC), which provides net cash for single-parent families with children at the lowest income levels. These changes eliminated income tax liability altogether for over 4 million lower-income families.<sup>25</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Critics often add the Social Security payroll tax and argue that the total federal tax burden shifted more to lower-income groups and away from upper-income groups, but Reagan's changes were in the income tax, not in the Social Security payroll tax. The payroll tax was imposed by liberal members of Congress over the last 50 years, and it is they, not Ronald Reagan, who should be held accountable for its distributional effects.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Even if one counts the Social Security payroll tax, the share of total federal taxes increased for the following:
<ul>
<p><li>For the top 1 percent of taxpayers, from 12.9 percent in 1980 to 15.4 percent in 1989.

<p><li>For the top 5 percent of taxpayers, from 27.3 percent in 1980 to 30.4 percent in 1989.

<p><li>For the top 20 percent of taxpayers, from 56.1 percent in 1980 to 58.6 percent in 1989.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Similarly, even if one includes the Social Security payroll tax, the share of total federal taxes declined for four groups:
<ul>
<p><li>For the second-highest 20 percent of taxpayers, from 22.2 percent in 1980 to 20.8 percent in 1989.

<p><li>For the middle 20 percent of taxpayers, from 13.2 percent in 1980 to 12.5 percent in 1989.

<p><li>For the second-lowest 20 percent of taxpayers, from 6.9 percent in 1980 to 6.4 percent in 1989.

<p><li></ul>For the lowest 20 percent of taxpayers, from 1.6 percent in 1980 to 1.5 percent in 1989.<sup>26</sup><p><b>What Happened to Poverty?</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite claims to the contrary, the Reagan economic recovery was effective in reducing poverty.
<ul>
<p><li>The poverty rate actually started to increase rapidly during the Carter years, rising by one-third from 1978 to 1983, when it climbed from 11.4 percent to 15.2 percent. It fell every year from 1984 to 1989, however, dropping by one-sixth from its 1983 peak to 12.8 percent in 1989.<sup>27</sup><p><li>The black poverty rate fell to 30.6 percent in 1989, the lowest on record except for 30.6 percent in 1978 and 30.3 percent in 1974.<sup>28</sup><p><li>From 1978 to 1983, the number of people in poverty increased by about 40 percent, from 24.7 million to 35.3 million. The Reagan recovery again reversed this trend, reducing the poverty population to 31.5 million -- a drop of 3.8 million -- in 1989.<sup>29</sup></ul><p><b>What Happened to the Misery Index?</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A popular indicator of the economic performance of Presidents has been the so-called misery index, defined as the total of inflation and unemployment each year. Ronald Reagan engineered the largest reduction in the misery index in history. From 1980 to 1988 (Reagan's last year in office), the index fell by over 50 percent. At 9.6, the index in 1988 was lower than in any other year since 1970, except for 1972 (see <a href="1980sc1.gif">Chart 1</a>). The Presidency of Jimmy Carter, who invented the term, still holds the record for the highest misery indices.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Harvard University economist Robert Barro has developed a different index of Presidential economic performance. His Economic Report Card for Presidents includes the change each year in inflation, unemployment, interest rates, and growth in Gross National Product (GNP) under each President.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Of all eleven Presidents since 1949, Reagan ranks both highest (first term, 1981-1985) and second-highest (second term, 1985-1989) in economic performance under Barro's index. Jimmy Carter ranks lowest, and George Bush ranks fifth (see <a href="1980st13.gif">Table 13</a>).

<p>

<b>The Boom in Charity</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The 1980s has been labeled by some as the decade of greed. The truth is that total giving to charitable causes in the United States grew at a record pace.
<ul>
<p><li>Between 1980 and 1989, charitable giving in real terms increased by 5.1 percent per year, compared to 3.3 percent per year from 1955 through 1979.<sup>30</sup><p><LI>Charitable giving per capita in real terms grew at a rate of 4 percent per year, double the rate of 2 percent per year from 1955 to 1979.<sup>31</sup><p><li>Between 1980 and 1989, charitable giving in real dollars rose by 56 percent to $121 billion.<sup>32</sup></ul><p><b>The Surge in Manufacturing</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another myth holds that during the 1980s, the U.S. economy was deindustrializing as manufacturing became uncompetitive and fell into decline. The facts tell a vastly different story.<ul><p><li>Manufacturing output rose by 38 percent in real inflation-adjusted dollars between 1980 and 1989. This left output at 23 percent of GNP in 1989, compared to 21 percent in 1980, and higher as a percentage of GNP in 1988 and 1989 than in any other year since World War II.<sup>33</sup><p><Li>The total industrial production index rose by about 30 percent from 1980 to 1990 and by about one-third during the Reagan recovery years of 1983 through 1990, about the same as total real economic growth. The more narrow manufacturing production index rose even faster, climbing by 39.5 percent from 1980 to 1990 and by 43.5 percent from 1983 to 1990.<sup>34</sup><p><li>Manufacturing productivity tripled, climbing almost 42 percent from 1980 to 1990 at a rate of 3.5 percent per year.<sup>35</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As a result of this sharp rise in productivity, U.S. manufacturing employment fell from 20 percent of total employment in 1980 to 16 percent in 1990, even though manufacturing output was near its highest-ever levels of GNP.<sup>36</sup>  Producing more and more with fewer workers is a sign of economic health and efficiency, not of failure.<p><b>Understanding the Trade Deficit</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Critics have made much of the fact that our trade deficit climbed from $19.4 billion in 1980 to $109.1 billion in 1984 and $145.4 billion in 1987 (see <a href="1980st14.gif">Table 14</a>). This is among the most meaningless economic statistics collected, however, and in no way indicates economic weakness during the Reagan years.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Deficits in the international trade in goods and services inevitably are balanced by surpluses in international capital transactions. A dollar earned overseas by selling to the United States ultimately can be used only to buy U.S. goods and services or to invest in the U.S. Therefore, dollars sent overseas for imports must be used to buy U.S. exports or to invest in the U.S., and total transactions must always balance. Even if the money is held overseas, the foreigner is investing in dollars, which is also a form of investment in the U.S.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

An inflow of capital investment means generally that foreign interests, instead of buying U.S. goods and services with money made by selling imports to the United States, are using it to buy capital assets in the U.S. The result is a deficit in trade, but a surplus in capital transactions. This is not a sign of economic deterioration, however; it is a sign of economic strength. It means the U.S. economy is strong enough to attract foreign capital investment to fuel still more economic growth.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This was the chief cause of the rising U.S. trade deficit during the 1980s. President Reagan's reductions in taxes, regulation, and inflation made the U.S. economy very attractive to foreign investors. The results:
<ul>
<p><li>Foreign private investment in the U.S. more than doubled in just two years, from $42.6billion in 1980 to $88.8 billion in 1982.

<p><li>By 1986, it had more than doubled again to $187.5 billion; by 1989, it had climbed to $205 billion (see <a href="1980st14.gif">Table 14</a>).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The effect is similar when U.S. citizens who have been investing abroad bring their capital home. Foreign interests, because they no longer are receiving dollars from those investments, also cannot use these dollars to buy U.S. goods and services, offsetting U.S. purchases of goods and services overseas. Everything else being equal, the trade deficit will rise when U.S. capital investment overseas falls and U.S. investors put their money in the U.S.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This was another cause of our rising trade deficit; but like the inflow of capital investment from abroad, it is a sign of strength, not deterioration. It means the economy is attracting the increased investment that leads to still more economic growth. Under Ronald Reagan, the net outflow of U.S. investment abroad collapsed in just two years, from $111.2 billion in 1982 to $20.6 billion in 1984 (see <a href="1980st14.gif">Table 14</a>). Reductions in taxes, regulation, and inflation appealed to U.S. investors just as they did to foreign investors, leading them to bring their capital home to invest in the booming U.S. economy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Booming economies also tend to run trade deficits, however. They import increased inputs from around the world to fuel their rapidly increasing production, which may be sold to their increasingly rich citizens rather than abroad, leaving a net trade deficit.<sup>37</sup>  This happened in the U.S. as the Reagan economy boomed from the end of 1982 to the middle of 1990, as discussed above.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The 1980s trade deficit certainly did not come about because U.S. goods and services were not competitive.
<ul>
<p><li>U.S. exports of manufactured goods rose by 90 percent from 1986 to 1992, compared to an increase of only 25 percent for the other leading industrial countries in the OECD. Our share of world manufacturing exports consequently increased from 14 percent in 1987 to 18 percent in 1991.<sup>38</sup><p><li>U.S. services are recognized as the best in the world, and net exports of those services multiplied by several times from 1986 to 1992.<sup>39</sup>  Exports accounted for 15.2 percent of GNP by 1990, up from 12.2 percent in 1980.<sup>40</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The U.S. ran a trade deficit for almost all of its first 100 years as it attracted tidal waves of foreign investment and its economy boomed, bringing in goods and services from around the world to fuel production and create the mightiest economic machine in world history. Trade deficits were an indication not of economic weakness, but of the skyrocketing economic strength of the new, free-market nation. During the Great Depression, by contrast, the U.S. ran trade surpluses.<sup>41</sup> Similarly, during the 100 years from Waterloo in 1815 to World War I in 1914, Britain dominated the world economically but also ran chronic trade deficits. As Wall Street financier Evan Galbraith has written, "America in the 1980s should be compared to Britain in its glory years, and not to a country that shows a trade deficit because its products are not competitive."<sup>42</sup>
<ul>
<p><li>By 1990, the trade deficit was falling rapidly, declining to $76.8 billion in that year (see <a href="1980st14.gif">Table 14</a>). Of course, U.S. economic growth all but disappeared during these years as well, as the Reagan boom ended in 1990. Just as the 1980s trade deficit was not a sign of economic weakness, its decline around the turn of the decade clearly was not a sign of economic strength.

<p><li>In line with the decline in the trade deficit, foreign investment in the U.S. dropped precipitously, from $205.2 billion in 1989 to $65.5 billion in 1990 and $48.6 billion in 1991 (see Table 14).

<p><li>Private U.S. investment abroad also had climbed back up to $71.4 billion in 1991, and the weak U.S. economy no longer was pulling imported inputs to fuel booming growth. These factors accounted for the decline in the trade deficit, just as their reverse accounted for its earlier increase.

</uL>
<p>
<b>Understanding Debt and Wealth</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The claim that the U.S. economy was burdened with excessive debt during the 1980s also is erroneous. Wealth soared, creating the capacity for additional debt, but debt generally increased no faster than the trends of earlier decades.
<ul>
<p><li>Real personal assets rose by nearly $6 trillion, from $15.5 trillion in 1980 to $21.1 trillion in 1990, an increase of 36 percent. Because the increase in real personal assets was three times the increase in personal debt (which rose by $1.8 trillion), personal real net worth rose by $3.8 trillion, or 29 percent.<sup>43</sup>

<p><li>The stock market more than tripled in value from 1980 to 1990, a larger increase than in any previous postwar decade. The ratio of corporate debt to market value of corporate assets was the same in 1989 as in 1969.<sup>44</sup><p><li>Total debt liabilities of all private, non-financial sectors rose at a rate of 5.4 percent, compared to 6.15 percent for the 1950s and 5.01 percent for the 1960s.<sup>45</sup>  This hardly seems excessive when compared to previous years.<p><li>Total real private net worth rose by $4.3 trillion from 1980 to 1989, at which time it totaled $17.1 trillion in constant 1987 dollars, an increase of about one-third over 1980.<sup>46</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another popular complaint has been that the United States became a "debtor nation" in the 1980s. The value of foreign investment in the United States exceeded the value of U.S. investment overseas for the first time in 1988, we are told, and the "investment deficit" has grown every year since then.<sup>47</sup>  This actually is another sign of economic strength, however, because it means the United States became more attractive to the world's investors.
<ul>
<p><li>U.S. investment income from overseas continued to exceed income to foreign interests from U.S. investments over this period by close to $20 billion per year.<sup>48</sup>  This indicates that a true valuation would show that U.S. investments overseas still are worth more than foreign investments in the U.S.<p><li>U.S. investments overseas are older on average, and their historical costs,upon which "debtor nation" statistics are based, underestimate their current market value even more as a result. The government has yet to find a way to account fully for the current market value of investments.

<p><li>Much foreign investment is equity investment, which represents no burden of repayment by the American people. It simply will earn the value of what it produces, with no guarantee of profits, as the increased capital invested enhances overall economic growth, jobs, and incomes.<sup>49</sup></ul><b>The Bottom Line: International Comparisons</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The United States today remains the wealthiest society on earth.<ul><p><li>Adjusting exchange rates for purchasing power parity, which compares what goods and services families in each country can buy, the U.S. standard of living is easily the highest in the world, exceeding West Germany's by about 25 percent and Japan's by about 40 percent.<sup>50</sup><p><li>Measured by actual physical conditions, the United States has much more and newer housing space, more cars per capita, more appliances, and more comforts generally than Western Europe, Japan, or any other nation or region.<sup>51</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some have argued that America is declining because the U.S. economy has fallen as a percentage of the world economy during the years since World War II. This decline stopped in about 1975, however, with the U.S. economy remaining through the 1980s about 34 percent as large as the rest of the world's economies combined.<sup>52</sup>  Moreover, after World War II, with most of the world's other major economies devastated by the war, the U.S. economy accounted for a huge percentage of the world economy.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One should hardly be surprised to find that our share of the world economy has declined as these other economies have rebuilt; nor should one be surprised or alarmed that it has declined further as some of the world's underdeveloped countries have learned to prosper. Far from indicating a problem with U.S. economic strength, these developments benefit the U.S. as well as the rest of the world. It would have been unrealistic indeed to expect our unusual postwar position relative to 
other countries not to decline as a result of the mutually beneficial and hoped-for economic development of those countries.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Virtually from the beginning of government in human society, death and taxes have been closely linked as well as inevitable. The passing of well-to-do individuals has been a lucrative moment for tax collectors. Most nations today impose death, estate, and inheritance taxes, and the United States is no exception.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This ancient practice, however, is beginning to change. Motivated by mounting evidence that death-related taxes may hold back the economic well-being of the living, several countries and American states recently have repealed their taxes on estates or significantly scaled them down. The U.S. Congress also is reexamining the wisdom of these taxes. Two bills, one in the House and another in the Senate, call for outright repeal of the estate and gift tax,<sup>1</sup> and dozens of others in both chambers propose significant modifications that give taxpayer relief.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Support for these proposals still comes primarily from advocates of limited government. But a growing number of liberals recently have shown a keen interest in repeal. Like so many critics of the estate tax, these new critics are disturbed by the growing evidence that this tax:
<ul>
<p><li>Reduces economic growth, hurting the jobs and incomes of the very people that wealth redistribution was intended to aid;

<p><li>Increases the cost of capital, slowing down research and development and the use of machines that would increase worker productivity -- and thus wages;

<p><li>Keeps interest rates on home loans and other major purchases higher than they should be; and

<p><li>Raises very little money -- in fact, it may cost the government and the taxpayers more in administrative and compliance fees than it raises in revenue.
</ul><p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Current wealth taxation policy stems from the mistaken view that redistributing income leads to the redistribution of economic power. Nearly a century of wealth taxation, however, shows that well-to-do Americans (including a great number of middle-class families) simply find ways of legally avoiding the tax collector. Not only do they save less and consume more of their income, thus benefiting from the lower taxes on consumption, but they also make less productive investments, such as large life insurance policies and substantial charitable contributions, thus reducing the chances that their death will leave a large taxable estate. The policy of using the estate tax to redistribute economic power actually leads to a distorted distribution of consumption and a less productive economy. Both of these unexpected outcomes worsen the economic condition of the less economically powerful.
<p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Founders understood the critical importance of reducing legal barriers to economic opportunity as the best public means of allowing every citizen to achieve economic fulfillment. This understanding found a home in the original U.S. Constitution, where direct taxes on wealth and income were prohibited except in time of national emergency. But soon after the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment (which lifted the ban on federal income taxation) in 1913, the federal government began a 60-year effort to create a more democratic economy through the forcible redistribution of wealth. That policy has imposed costs on economic growth as well as fundamental liberties.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is time to repeal the estate, gift, and generation-skipping tax. The case for this turns on three factors: the diminishing importance of the estate tax as a federal revenue stream; the failure of the tax to achieve its public policy objectives, principally the creation of economic benefits for lower-income Americans; and the continuing damage the tax exacts on the economy in terms of jobs, output, and growth. Transcending all of these factors is the growing appreciation that wealth taxation infringes on fundamental liberties and is inconsistent with the principle of limited government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the estate tax were repealed, the effect on the economy would be significant. According to an econometric study conducted by Professor Richard Wagner of George Mason University, the effect of the estate tax on the cost of capital is so great that within eight years, a U.S. economy without an estate tax would be producing $80 billion more in annual output and would have created 250,000 additional jobs and a $640 billion larger capital stock.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;An analysis by The Heritage Foundation using two leading econometric models also found that repealing the estate tax would have a large and beneficial effect on the economy. Specifically, the Heritage analysis found that if the tax were repealed this year, over the next nine years:
<ul>
<p><li>The nation's economy would average as much as $11 billion per year in extra output;

<p><li>An average of 145,000 additional new jobs could be created;

<p><li>Personal income could rise by an average of $8 billion per year above current projections; and

<p><li>The deficit actually would decline, since revenues generated by extra growth would more than compensate for the meager revenues currently raised by the inefficient estate tax.
The estate tax has few friends, other than tax attorneys, and raises very little revenue at a heavy cost to the economy. It generates complex tax avoidance schemes. The hardest hit by the tax are small businesspeople who work hard to pass on an enterprise of value to their children. And its bias against saving and wealth generation is the antithesis of the American dream.
</ul><p>

<b>HOW WEALTH TAXES BEGAN IN AMERICA</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Current public policy on the taxation of intergenerational wealth stems from roots laid down in the American Revolution and, oddly enough, in the Revolutionaries' efforts to create a society in which all citizens would be free to become as wealthy as their talents allow. As with so many principles that trace back to the Revolutionary period, the liberty to acquire and dispose of personal property became, by the 20th century, subsidiary to another element of the country's founding: the drive to create democratic equality of economic opportunity.<sup>2</sup><p><b>The Early Years</b><p>Alexis de Tocqueville paid considerable attention to the views Americans held about wealth and economic opportunity when he made his famous tour of the early Republic in 1831. On the one hand, Americans had a nearly universal disdain for aristocracy and any non-republican show of wealth. But on the other hand, nearly everyone with whom Tocqueville became acquainted wanted desperately to be rich:
<blockquote>
	I do not mean that there is any lack of wealthy individuals in the United States; I know of no country, indeed, where the love of money has taken stronger hold on the affections of men and where a profounder contempt is expressed for the theory of the permanent equality of property. But wealth circulates with inconceivable rapidity, and experience shows that it is rare to find two succeeding generations in the full enjoyment of it.<sup>3</sup></blockquote><b>Removing Barriers to Wealth.</b> The democratization of acquiring wealth constituted the touchstone of the new civilization that the Revolutionaries sought to build. Theirs was a battle against barriers erected in the Old World to prevent the rise of the common man. For centuries, laws had been applied differently to rich and poor people. The Revolutionaries overturned this by embracing the legal principle of equality before the law, extending it to all free Americans, and giving it the sharp legal teeth of natural liberty in one's life and property. They freed labor and capital from taxes, turned over to communities virtually all regulation of commerce, and tried in many other ways to remove government from everyday life. This truly was the age of the individual. Liberated from the oppressive economic and social networks that had surrounded the Crown and that prevented ordinary people from rising, the Revolutionaries emphasized the importance of allowing the marketplace rather than birth and influence to be the measure of personal worth. As Gordon Wood writes in his Pulitzer Prize-winning history of this period,
<blockquote>
	A man was now praised for having arrived and risen "without friends," for having been "the architect of his own fortune," or for never having been "borne on the shoulders of patronage."  For many Americans the ability to make money -- not whom one knew, or who one's father was, or where one went to college -- now became the only proper democratic means for distinguishing one man from another.<sup>4</sup></blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Nothing epitomizes the zeal of the Revolutionaries for fundamentally altering the process of acquiring wealth better than the rapid abolition of primogeniture and the narrowing of entail. The ancient practice of primogeniture settled the entirety of an estate on the first-born male, thus leaving the remaining male children and all female children without inheritance. Primogeniture made birth order rather than merit the principal cause of wealth. Thus, dullards were as likely as commercial geniuses to end up ruling vast properties and exercising immense social and political influence. Entail nicely complemented primogeniture by making it all but impossible for real estate to leave a family, no matter how desirous a family one day might be to part with the property or how badly they managed their estate. Together, primogeniture and entail put a gigantic weight around the neck of economic progress and reduced the rate of commercial improvement to an obese creep.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Thomas Jefferson, himself initially a victim of primogeniture and then its beneficiary upon the death of his older brother, vigorously opposed both practices and saw legislation that he had written in 1777 abolishing primogeniture passed by the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1785. Within a few years, every new state government had followed Virginia's lead, and no subsequent state ever seriously considered allowing it. For Jefferson, the reform of entail and abolition of primogeniture were two of the most important actions taken in the early Republic to create "a system by which every fibre would be eradicated of ancient or future aristocracy, and a foundation laid for a government truly republican."<sup>5</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even a cursory reading of the Revolutionary texts underscores this unrelenting focus of the Founders on removing barriers to the wealth-creating process. Early American public policy was not aimed at redistributing wealth or at restraining its growth. Rather, the early Republic pursued a public policy of removing obstacles to entrepreneurship and economic self-improvement. If an egalitarian theme was present in early American public policy, it was the theme of equality before the law, which often meant the elimination of legal privileges that gave one class an economic advantage over another.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This attitude to wealth creation can be found in the Constitution of the United States. A straightforward reading of the following paragraph from Article I, Section 9 appears to prohibit all direct taxes, which would include a prohibition against taxes on income and wealth: "No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken."<sup>6</sup><p><b>Changing Attitudes Toward Wealth and Taxation</b><p><b>National Emergencies.</b> It was generally accepted during the 19th century that Congress had extensive authority to bend the Constitution during times of national emergency. For example, the writ of <I>habeas corpus</i> could be suspended in times of war or rebellion in order to advance the public good. Thus, it appeared well within Congress's emergency powers to impose taxes on wealth and inheritance to meet the wholly unexpected revenue requirements of the federal government during dangerous times.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Congress wasted no time in testing its expansive wartime authority: Taxes on estates were imposed first during the Quasi-War with France (1797-1799), but repealed in 1802. Still, had it not been for the Civil War, it is possible that after 1802, the 19th century would have been an uninterrupted period of no estate or intergenerational wealth taxation. But the expenses of the Union government exhausted its revenue sources so quickly that President Lincoln and the war Congresses employed the emergency clauses of the Constitution to enact the first modern intergenerational wealth tax. The Revenue Act of 1862 revived the death tax of the Quasi-War Congress and recrafted it into a true inheritance tax. Congress repealed the tax on wealth in 1870.<sup>7</sup><p><b>Wealth Seen As an Obstacle to Economic Opportunity.</b> While costly national emergencies occasionally challenged the idea of unrestricted wealth creation and ownership, more important in the long run was a change of attitude in some circles toward the relationship between wealth and economic opportunity. Between 1880 and 1916, the party of Lincoln overflowed with political warriors who saw no American problem that could not be solved by righteous citizens wielding the policy tools of the newly powerful federal government. Just as they had overcome the Southern assertion of states' rights, they would be victorious over the growing concentrations of private economic power that they viewed as fundamentally threatening the bedrock American value of equal economic opportunity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reform Republicans created many tools for achieving their "new economic democracy," but perhaps none was so important to this project as the income tax. If the principal post-war threat to the Republic came from the great wealth that industrialization created for a few privileged people, and from the opportunities this wealth provided for corrupting political institutions, reformers needed above all else a legal means of redistributing wealth, thus diffusing the political power that great wealth provided. In 1894, Congress took its first tentative step in this direction by passing the Income Tax Act. Significantly, the heart of the Act was a definition of gifts and inheritances as income.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Supreme Court wasted little time in striking down the Income Tax Act. In 1895, the Court ruled<sup>8</sup> that the Act constituted a direct tax on certain forms of income that did not meet the Constitution's requirement of apportioning such a tax according to population. Without a change in the Constitution, the Court concluded, all such efforts at taxing income would fail to pass constitutional review.<p>The constitutional obstacle was removed in 1913 with ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment.<sup>9</sup>  Congress quickly passed an income tax in 1914 that levied a 3 percent rate on all incomes above $30,000 (about $900,000 in 1996 dollars).<sup>10</sup>  It then launched the modern period of estate and gift taxation through the Revenue Act of 1916.<p>The Revenue Act of 1916 established rules for valuing a decedent's estate, for capturing taxable lifetime transfers into the estate, and for determining those transfers made for inadequate consideration and those that became effective only upon death. It created exemptions and deductions that continue to be a part of estate tax law today. Most important, the Act introduced progressive taxation into estate tax policy.<sup>11</sup>  This element clearly distinguished its public policy objective from earlier death taxes: The central mission of federal estate and gift taxation would be the redistribution of wealth.<sup>12</sup><p>After 1916, and despite a few efforts to retreat from estate and gift taxation immediately following World War I, taxes on intergenerational wealth transfers became a permanent feature of U.S. tax policy.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The history of wealth transfer taxation between 1920 and 1976 consisted largely of expanding the tax base for estate and gift taxes and increasing the tax rates. Congress raised the top marginal rate for estate taxes to 40 percent in 1924. In 1932, the top rate rose to 45 percent and the gift tax became permanent. The imminence of hostilities in 1941 caused Congress to search for additional revenues and led to a further increase in the top rate on estates to 77 percent.<sup>13</sup><p>Figure 1 shows the rapid increase in estate and gift tax collections after the end of World War II. Intergenerational taxes grew significantly in both amount and rate, even when adjusted for inflation. This growth probably stemmed as much from the demographics of the transfer taxes as from high tax rates: The late 1960s saw the beginning of generational transfers from those Americans who had weathered the storms of depression and world war. Transfers increasingly consisted of small businesses and farms as well as stocks, bonds, and liquid assets. And as the number of taxable estates containing businesses grew, so did the pressure for estate tax relief.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Congress recognized in 1976 that a tax intended to diminish the power of great wealth more frequently ended up taxing ordinary Americans who had accumulated taxable estates through nothing more than frugality, entrepreneurship, and plain hard work. The Tax Reform Act of 1976 addressed the concerns of these people through a number of policy changes. Specifically, the Act:
<ul>
<p><li>Unified the estate and gift tax, enabling taxpayers to apply unused gift tax allowances as deductions against their taxable estates;

<p><li>Lowered the top marginal rate to 70 percent and expanded the marital deductions for estates of moderate size; and

<p><li>Created special rules for estates consisting primarily of small businesses and family farms that allowed more of these entities to escape estate taxes altogether.<sup>14</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Congress's eagerness in 1976 to address problems with intergenerational taxation coincided with a growing understanding among many academics and politicians that high tax rates retard economic growth.<sup>15</sup>  This growing awareness led the Congresses of the 1980s to reduce the economic influence of intergenerational taxes, largely through tax cuts and more generous deductions. The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 in particular reflected this redirection in public policy. For example, the Act created the unified credit that currently exempts the first $600,000 in an otherwise taxable estate from any tax liability,<sup>16</sup> and it cut the top marginal rate from 70 percent to 50 percent. In addition, the Act further liberalized the rules governing the tax valuation of closely held businesses and farms, and lengthened the period of time for the payment of estate taxes by estates that contain such businesses.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With few exceptions, tax and budget bills passed between 1981 and 1992 adhered to the policy changes contained in the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981.<sup>17</sup>  Even in the largest tax increase in U.S. history -- the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993 -- it was apparent that revenue goals and not class warfare was the basis of the wealth tax provision. While Congress added two new rates (53 percent and 55 percent) to the estate and gift tax, these still did not go above Ronald Reagan's top rate. And while two new income tax rates (35 percent and 39.6 percent) were enacted, they still were just over half as high as the nearly confiscatory rates that prevailed during the administration of Dwight Eisenhower. In fact, without notice, wealth transfer tax policy has lost its ideological thrust. Its philosophical justification is disappearing; its roots in public policy are growing shorter every year; and its retention depends on its value as a revenue-raiser. But as we shall see later, besides its damaging impact on wealth creation and economic well-being, as a source of revenue it is more trouble than it is worth.<sup>18</sup><p><b>THE ESTATE AND GIFT TAX TODAY</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Current federal wealth transfer law is a confusing maze through which only the bravest taxpayers will travel without an experienced guide. The federal government taxes intergenerational wealth transfers through the estate, gift, and generation-skipping tax systems.<sup>19</sup><p>

<b>The Estate Tax</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The largest component of the federal government's three-part wealth taxation system is the estate tax. Current estate tax law itself has three basic elements: 1) definition of the estate tax base, or the gross estate of a decedent; 2) deductions that can be made from the gross estate to arrive at the taxable estate; and 3) the computation of estate tax liability.
<ol>
	<p><li><b>The Tax Base</b><p><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Estate tax law defines the gross estate of a decedent as the "fair market value"<sup>20</sup> of all personal or real property, wherever situated and however tangible, at the time of the decedent's death.<sup>21</sup>  This valuation of an estate's property attempts to quantify such property at its "highest and best use."  However, the valuation of a business or a farm on a "fair market value" standard may actually result in an artificially low value of an ongoing enterprise. For example, consider a start-up business in a good part of town. The owner suddenly dies, and his son wants to continue the business. If the estate tax value is determined by recent sales of other businesses located near it, then it may be valued at an amount well above its actual worth based on the cash generated by the business (which may even be operating at a loss in this early phase). This makes a big difference to an estate, since the business may have to be sold in order to pay the estate tax because the son is unable to raise a loan to pay the tax. In 1976, Congress recognized this negative potential of the "fair market value" rule and permitted estates containing small businesses and farms to be valued at their present use rather than at their "market value."<sup>22</sup><ul><p><li><b>Insurance Policies.</b> Special rules apply to the value of insurance policies contained in the decedent's estate. If the life insurance policy is paid out to benefit the estate, of if the decedent either held a property right in the policy or conveyed this property right within three years of death, then the value of the policy is added to the gross estate. A similar rule applies to annuities.<sup>23</sup><p><li><b>Joint Property.</b> A property rights rule also applies to property owned jointly by the decedent and someone other than the decedent's spouse: Such jointly owned property is included in the gross estate to the extent of the ratio of consideration furnished. With respect to property owned jointly with a surviving spouse, only 50 perc
ent of such property becomes a part of the gross estate.<sup>24</sup><p><li><b>Gifts.</b> Gifts and other transfers of property made by the decedent well before death also may be included in the gross estate if the decedent retained the ability to influence the disposition and use of such property. Similar inclusion in the gross estate applies to gifts that occur only upon death. However, sales of property and other alienation of property from the decedent's control made throughout his or her life are not included in gross estate.</ul>	

<p><li><b>Deductions</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Once the total value of an estate has been calculated, numerous deductions may be applied. The result of these subtractions from the gross estate is the taxable estate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	
The first category of deductions relates to direct expenses of the estate: All costs of the funeral, of legal claims against the estate, of the executor's administration of the estate, and of mortgages paid by the estate may be deducted.<sup>25</sup>  Second, the value of property passing to the decedent's surviving spouse may be deducted. Finally, the estate may deduct the value of all charitable bequests to organizations recognized by the federal government as tax-exempt.

<p><li><b>Tax Liability</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The taxable estate that results from the application of these gross estate deductions is taxed according to a somewhat cumbersome four-step process. First, the value of all taxable gifts made over the decedent's lifetime is added to the net estate. Second, a before-credits tax is calculated by multiplying this "grossed up" estate by the relevant tax rate. Third, this before-credits tax is reduced by subtracting the tax on all gifts made after 1976. And fourth, various credits are applied to the remaining sum.<sup>26</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are four credits available for estate tax reduction, but by far the most significant is the unified transfer tax credit.<sup>27</sup>  This credit is a flat $192,800, which equates to a $600,000 net taxable estate. Thus, the unified transfer tax credit means that current law exempts from taxation all otherwise taxable estates up to $600,000 in value.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Above $600,000, estates face a tax rate table that contains no fewer than 17 different rates, ranging from 18 percent to 55 percent. There is a 5 percent surcharge for estates between $10,000,000 and $21,040,000, intended to phase out the unified transfer credit. Thus, estates up to $21 million in value face a 60 percent marginal rate.<sup>28</sup></ol><p><b>The Gift Tax</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second layer of federal wealth transfer taxation is the levy made on lifetime property gifts. Like the definition of gross estate, current law contains a host of decisions that the courts and executors must make in determining the value of taxable gifts.<ol>	<p><li><b>The Tax Base.</b> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the most difficult decision of all is the one that must be made first: determining the value of the decedent's lifetime giving. This difficulty arises on two fronts:
<ul><p><li>
<b>First,</b> a gift is the transfer of property for something less than full legal consideration to a party generally within the donor's family. On the one hand, the executor must determine which gift transfers meet the test of insufficient legal consideration. On the other hand, the executor must distinguish gifts made for income tax purposes that require "detached and disinterested generosity" from those that qualify for the gift tax.<sup>29</sup><p><li><b>Second,</b> the executor or the court must wrestle with the question of "fair market value."  The federal gift tax requires that <i>all</i> wealth transfers made as gifts over the decedent's entire life be valued for taxation. That means, incredibly, that appraisals of value must be made for gifts made decades before the decedent's death. Moreover, these gifts must be appraised in terms of their "fair market value" at the time they were made, which is a task that often stretches the frontiers of property appraisal to its breaking point.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Such extraordinary efforts at valuation and record reconstruction must be made in order to determine whether the annual level of gift giving exceeded the allowed limits. An estate may exclude from the gift tax base all annual present interest gift transfers of $10,000 or less per donee.<sup>30</sup>  But if the donor made the gift to meet the donee's tuition or medical expenses, the limit does not apply. Furthermore, if the donor's spouse elects to make a similar gift to the same donee (a practice known as gift-splitting), the annual limit rises to $20,000. All gifts above these limits become part of the gift tax base.

	<p><li><b>Deductions.</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 

Like the estate tax base, the gift tax base can be reduced by certain deductions. Besides gift-splitting, certain gifts to one's spouse may be deducted. Also, gifts to charities recognized by the IRS as tax-exempt organizations can be deducted from the gift tax base.<sup>31</sup>  Finally, special rules apply to the division of property in a divorce or separation, and this leads to more gift tax deductions.<sup>32</sup>	<p><li><b>Tax Liability.</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Computing the amount of gift tax is relatively simple. First, taxable gifts for the current and all previous calendar years are summed and taxed using the tax rate table for estates. Second, this total amount of gift tax then is reduced by any unused unified transfer tax credit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To illustrate, suppose that a married couple gave their only child $10,000 a year for a period of 20 years, for a cumulative total of $200,000. These gifts equal the maximum annual amount that taxpayers may exclude from the federal gift tax base. However, for four years this couple made additional gifts to their child of $100,000 a year, for a total of $400,000. This latter amount is above the limit and is taxable. Now suppose that the gross taxable estate of this couple equals $1,000,000, which includes the taxable gifts. The executor of the estate will use the unified credit of $600,000 to reduce the taxable amount and will pay taxes on the remaining $400,000, or the additional gifts the couple gave their child.
</ol><p>

<b>The Generation-Skipping Tax</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Wealth transfer taxes have been so consistently high throughout this century that a substantial cottage industry devoted to estate tax avoidance has blossomed within the legal and financial communities. One of their cleverest inventions was a trust established by a parent for the lifetime benefit of his or her children that passed tax-free to the parent's grandchildren upon the parent's death (or bypassed the children completely and went directly to the grandchildren). The trust avoided estate taxes altogether because such taxes are never levied on amounts that cannot be controlled by the taxpayer. However, some trusts were designed to pay out to the grandchildren upon the death of the taxpayer's children. Thus, the taxpayer could target specific individuals to receive benefits from the estate if the taxpayer could skip a generation through the creative use of a tax-free trust.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress enacted a cumbersome tax law change in 1976 to close the indirect generation-skipping transfer, but it left unaddressed the trust or bequest that directly skipped the parent's children. Both of these loopholes were addressed by Congress in 1986. As part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Congress established a flat-rate tax of 55 percent on all generation-skipping transfers. Transfers subject to the tax are those made from a trust to a "skip person" (someone two or more generations removed from the donor); those made by a donor directly to a "skip person" without going through a trust; and those that result from termination of an interest in a property or trust, which usually happens upon the death of the donor.<sup>33</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As with the estate tax and the gift tax, several exclusions and exemptions apply. The same $10,000 annual exclusion and tuition and medical exemptions found in the gift tax law apply to generation-skipping taxes. A total lifetime exclusion of $1,000,000 ($2,000,000 for married couples) is allowed. Finally, transfers made prior to January 1, 1990, are exempt up to $2,000,000 ($4,000,000 for married couples).<sup>34</sup><p><b>THE LIBERAL CASE FOR REPEALING THE ESTATE TAX</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This complex tax edifice rests on the foundation that taxing intergenerational wealth transfers results in less concentrated wealth holdings and that this leads in turn to greater economic opportunity and a more democratic society. Certainly simplicity cannot be raised in support of this tax policy, as the above discussion indicates. And, as Figures 1 and 2 show, the estate and gift tax cannot be justified as playing an important role in financing government: The unified estate and gift tax now brings in less than 1.7 percent of total federal revenues.
<p>

<b>The Liberal Egalitarian Argument for Intergenerational Wealth Taxation</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The case for the estate tax turns on the tax's effectiveness in achieving greater economic democracy through the redistribution of wealth. If its supporters cannot sustain the argument that the estate tax improves equality of economic opportunity, then there exists little else (except perhaps inertia) to recommend continuation of this part of U.S. tax policy. Other, simpler taxes could meet revenue objectives far more efficiently.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Academic support for intergenerational wealth taxation remains warm, in large part because of the role it plays in the most important theoretical treatise on liberal egalitarianism, John Rawls's <i>A Theory of Justice.</i><sup>35</sup>  Since its publication in 1971, this careful, magisterial presentation of the case for liberal democracy infused with just institutions has permeated thinking on most issues in social and political theory. It is fair to say that no stronger theoretical case for intergenerational wealth taxation exists.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

At the center of Rawls's case for wealth taxation is the principle that "[a]ll social primary goods -- liberty and opportunity, income and wealth, and the bases of self-respect -- are to be distributed equally unless an unequal distribution of any or all of these goods is to the advantage of the least favored."<sup>36</sup>  While at first blush this principle would appear to suggest radical egalitarianism in economic and political life, Rawls recognizes the superiority of "free" over socialized markets to produce benefits for the least advantaged citizens, which leads him and many like-minded political theorists to support significant differences in the economic conditions of individuals within a generation. After a century of economic experimentation, there can be little doubt that everyone achieves greater economic benefit when individuals are allowed to discover their own comparative advantage and focus their labor in the area where they can make the greatest economic difference.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This tolerance for intragenerational differences leads Rawls to oppose all income taxes, since economic income stems from natural differences in talent and from differing propensities of individuals to apply themselves to hard work.<sup>37</sup>  However, two principled considerations compel Rawls to take substantial exception to intergenerational differences in economic condition.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>First,</b> Rawls opposes the transfer of accumulated property to succeeding generations because it undermines the first principle of a just society: that everyone has "an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all."<sup>38</sup>  Those who begin with a significant unearned endowment of property resources place others not so advantaged in a less equal condition, and this undermines the principle that everyone should have access to the same system of equal basic liberties.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>Second,</b> this difference might be tolerated if it produced greater benefits for the least advantaged than for the advantaged. However, intergenerational wealth transfers create benefits that flow in the opposite direction: Over time, they enhance the advantages of inheriting generations and generally degrade the liberties of the unbenefitted. Thus, "[t]he taxation of inheritance and income at progressive rates (when necessary), and the legal definition of property rights, are to secure the institutions of equal liberty in a property-owning democracy and the fair value of the rights they establish."<sup>39</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While Rawls does not advance confiscatory taxation of intergenerational wealth transfers, his argument does imply substantial taxing discretion by the state. In his universe, the state guides the institutions of distribution; should government determine that wealth transfers constitute significant barriers to the equal enjoyment of liberties (as defined by Rawls), it clearly has the power to tax away as much of the wealth that moves between generations as it deems necessary to restore justice.

<p>
<b>Objections to the Liberal Egalitarian Case for the Estate Tax</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A number of objections could be raised against the Rawlsian case for wealth transfer taxation, not the least of them being the questionable assertion of government authority over the intergenerational disposition of private property. If wealth is acquired legally and transferred peacefully (that is, in some non-tortious fashion that breaches no contract pertaining to the property), government has no ethical standing to interfere with its disposition.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Of course, liberal egalitarians claim a more expansive role for government, a principal element of which is the progressive enhancement of equality of condition among citizens. Thus, it is important first to consider the estate tax within the context of the argument that justifies the tax's existence. If it can be shown that the estate tax does not advance the ethical program of the liberal egalitarians, then other objections to this tax that can be raised without assuming this ethical and moral framework become more compelling.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This approach to analyzing the estate tax was taken in a seminal monograph by Edward J. McCaffery published in <i>The Yale Law Journal</i> in 1994.<sup>40</sup>  Professor McCaffery comes to the debate over the estate tax with impeccable political credentials. Unlike many critics of intergenerational taxation who frame their objections within a larger, politically conservative analysis of contemporary government, MaCaffery formulated his critique of the estate tax within a liberal framework. As he stated last year before the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance:<blockquote>	I am an unrequited liberal, in both the classical and contemporary political senses of that word, whose views on social and distributive justice might best be described as progressive. I used to believe in the gift and estate tax as a vehicle for obtaining justice. As to the latter belief, only, I am now prepared to confess that I "was blind, but now can see."<sup>41</sup></blockquote><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;McCaffery raises five general objections to the liberal egalitarian argument supporting intergenerational wealth taxation. Each of them assumes the ethical and moral objectives of the liberal political program.
<ol>
<p><li><b>The currently combined income and estate tax system encourages large <i>inter vivos</i> gift transfers, which have the effect of creating a greater inequality of starting points or a less level economic playing field.</b> This predictable effect of the estate tax law is aggravated further by the fact that high estate tax rates encourage the consumption rather than the transfer of wealth. Purchasing goods and services instead of saving the funds that support that consumption produces larger differences between rich and poor people. Thus, the estate tax is illiberal because it undermines rather than advances the liberal egalitarian objective of equality of economic opportunity.

<p><li><b>While higher wealth transfer taxes might reduce the level of <i>inter vivos</i> gifts, and other tax law changes could be made to penalize the spending behavior of rich families, it currently is both practically and politically impossible to do so.</b> On the one hand, analysts are becoming increasingly aware of the intergenerational focus of much current saving behavior at all income levels. Liberals should promote the creation of transferable wealth among the less advantaged. On the other hand, politicians are becoming increasingly aware of how much voters want taxes to fall, not rise. The estate or inheritance tax has been repealed in Australia, Canada, Israel, and California; and the movement for tax reform is a spreading, worldwide movement.
<p>
<p><li><b>There will always be differences between the starting conditions of people in a non-ideal world.</b> If liberal egalitarians attempted to eliminate all the differences that stem from intergenerational wealth transfers, they would risk leaving the least advantaged even worse off than they were before. Not only would confiscatory taxation reduce the consumption behavior of wealthy people, thereby also reducing employment and incomes among poorer citizens, but it would depress the amount of economic capital as well, thereby reducing economic expansion and income growth, both of which are central to improving the conditions of the least advantaged.
<p>
<p><li><b>"[It] is the use and not the mere concentration of wealth that threatens reasonable liberal values."</b><sup>42</sup>  Generally speaking, the accumulation of savings and the promotion of earnings that underlie the growth of savings are "goods" that liberals like. Earnings and savings create a "common pool" of resources that can be used to promote improvements in the general welfare through public and private means. Liberals generally regard the consumption behavior of the wealthy as objectionable; thus, wealth transfer taxation, which attacks savings and promotes wanton consumption, is wholly ill-suited to the attainment of an ideal liberal society.

<p><li><b>The best tax policy that liberal egalitarians could pursue, if attaining liberal social and political objectives truly motivates the liberal program, is one that taxes consumption, not savings.</b> McCaffery writes that:<blockquote>

	[b]y getting our reasonable political judgments wrong -- by taxing work and savings while condoning, even encouraging large-scale use [consumption] -- the status quo impedes the liberal project....  The real threats to liberty and equality from private possession alone turn out, on closer scrutiny, to relate to possession <i>qua</i> potential or actual use, each of which can be addressed -- indeed, can <i>best</i> be addressed -- in a tax system without an estate tax.<sup>43</sup>
</ol><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Not only, then, is the estate tax inconsistent with a liberal program of promoting equality of economic condition, but it encourages behavior that works against liberal objectives. It supports consumption and depletion by penalizing savings and earnings. It encourages the kind of strange world where it costs less for a millionaire like Steve Forbes to spend $30 million of his own money on a presidential campaign than to save $30 million for his children's future -- an investment upon which he will pay a 55 percent transfer tax as opposed to a campaign expenditure upon which no additional taxes are ever levied. How many new jobs and new businesses did Mr. Forbes's campaign create as opposed to the same amount saved in a bank that lends the funds to entrepreneurs and business managers?  Liberals and conservatives are beginning to answer this question in precisely the same way.
</ol>
<b>Few Friends.</b> The weaknesses of the estate and income tax system as a tool for redistribution long have been known, even to its academic friends. Joseph Stiglitz, who now serves as the Chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, concluded in 1978 that the estate tax effectively transfers resources from the saver to the spender, which, absent any offsetting tax policy change, reduces the stock of capital and leads to lower levels of national wealth.<sup>44</sup>  Furthermore, wrote Stiglitz,
<blockquote>
	because of capital accumulation effects, the estate tax may not achieve the objective to which it is presumably directed, that is, equalizing the distribution of income; if the government takes actions to offset these accumulation effects, the tax will lead to an increase in equality of income and wealth. The desirability of the estate tax may still be questioned, not only because of the distortions which it introduces but also because it may actually increase inequality in the distribution of consumption.<sup>45</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Alan Blinder, another member of the President's initial Council of Economic Advisers and subsequently Vice-Chairman of the Federal Reserve System's Board of Governors, also has raised serious doubts about the redistributional promises of the estate tax.<sup>46</sup>  He has been joined by Michael Boskin, Martin Feldstein, Gary Becker, Laurence Kotlikoff, Lawrence Summers, and many other economists with prominent connections to mainstream economics.<sup>47</sup>


<p><b>THE ECONOMIC CASE AGAINST THE ESTATE TAX</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In addition to the Left's declining enthusiasm for the ideology of wealth taxes, two economic issues have added to the momentum for repeal. One is the mounting weight of economic and financial evidence against the estate and gift tax as such. The other is the rapidly spreading general view that income taxes and the multiple taxation of savings reduce economic growth, which in turn slows the rate of economic improvement by the least advantaged. Among the economic problems associated with the tax:
<ul>
<p><li><b>The estate tax raises little money and encourages inefficient tax-avoidance schemes.</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
Bolstering the skepticism about the efficiency of the estate and gift tax is the striking fact of how little revenue it raises for the federal government. Despite the tax's broad reach, theoretically touching upon nearly all transferable wealth, the unified tax raised only $14.7 billion in 1995.<sup>48</sup>  As Figure 1 shows, the estate and gift tax consistently has fallen as a percentage of total federal revenues, while at the same time the total amount of wealth has risen dramatically.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

When a tax raises significantly less than the estimate of its potential, it is often because taxpayers have discovered ways to avoid the tax and have changed their economic behavior in ways that reduce the pool of funds from which the tax is drawn. To understand the extent to which this happens, it is necessary to estimate just what estate tax collections theoretically should look like.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Public finance economists have struggled for a long time with this question. Producing an adequate answer, however, requires knowing a great deal more than we now do about the size of legal tax avoidance and the degree to which taxpayers change their economic behavior in order to reduce their estate tax liabilities. Moreover, economists do not know the size of the wealth pool within which estates are formed. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis periodically estimates household net worth, or the sum of durables, savings, and equities held by households.<sup>49</sup>  The Bureau currently estimates this net worth to be about $26.4 trillion, of which $8.4 trillion is in equities. While this amount by no means constitutes the tax base for the estate tax, a portion of this enormous sum most certainly does. For example, Laurence J. Kotlikoff estimates that slightly more than 50 percent of household wealth is held as intergenerational savings.<sup>50</sup>  If one assumes that this 50 percent (or $13.2 trillion) is transferred in equal amounts over two generations, or 46 years, then about $290 billion annually is moving to the next generation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Even this figure probably overstates the tax base for the estate tax. Many economists argue that taxpayers who believe they will pay estate taxes will change their economic behavior in ways that result in a huge shrinkage of the estate tax base.<sup>51</sup>  B. Douglas Bernheim argues that high estate tax rates lead taxpayers to make far more cash gifts to their children than they otherwise would, in large part because their children pay taxes at lower rates than they do. Bernheim estimates that 50 percent to 75 percent of all intergenerational gifts are made because of the estate tax. Charitable gifts and other revenue losses are between 70 percent and 80 percent of total estate tax revenue. Put another way, indirect revenue losses in 1995 might have been $11 billion on revenues of $14.7 billion.<sup>52</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The revenue data strongly imply significant tax avoidance and other economic behavior that responds to high tax rates by moving national wealth (and thus taxable estates) from savings to consumption. It is exceptionally difficult, however, for analysts to go from implication to quantification. Recent breakthroughs in the economic understanding of household savings may lead ultimately to convincing estimates of how much savings behavior stems from income and estate tax policy. Even so, economists can offer a number of important insights about the deleterious economic effects of tax policy on economic performance.
<p>
<li><b>The estate tax discourages savings.</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Savings take many different forms -- cash reserves in a bank, stock in a corporation, art, land, housing, ownership of a business, and so forth -- that serve many different purposes. Households hold cash in a bank largely to finance future consumption, like the purchase of a house, or as a hedge against unanticipated household expenses like costly medical care. Similarly, the equity component of a mortgage is designed to be used to purchase future housing. These two forms of savings are largely liquid and thus earn relatively low rates of return. Households put money in a bank with the understanding that their funds can be withdrawn virtually at any time the household prefers. The bank, in turn, lends these savings with this same understanding in mind, and therefore prefers relatively short-term, low-risk loans that contain significant liquidity for the bank. So if a household saves in a long-term time deposit (for example, a 10-year certificate of deposit), it will demand a higher rate of return as compensation for not having these funds available for consumption. The bank, in turn, is freer to invest in riskier ventures for which it also can demand a higher rate of return. The bank's cost of a loan failure also falls when it is working with longer-term savings: It knows it has a certain period of time to make successful loans that cover its contract with the saver and yield the bank a profit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The decision to save largely follows this simple story. When households consume most of their income, any long-term investment must earn a high return. However, when they increase their savings relative to their consumption of income, they require less compensation for foregone consumption, and the required rate of return falls. Economists are divided between those who believe that households have a relatively fixed savings percentage over their lifetimes (which implies relatively fixed time preferences) and those who see the percentage of savings as something that fluctuates as certain preferences (including time or consumption) and costs (particularly taxes) change. It is this latter viewpoint that is particularly relevant to estate tax analysis.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Taxes play a role in savings decisions because they increase the cost of saving relative to consuming income. For example, if a household invests 25 percent of its income after taxes in a bank account that earns interest, it will pay additional taxes on any interest it takes as income. If another household decides to invest its 25 percent in corporate stocks, it will pay additional taxes on any capital gains it takes as income. However, if both households take that same 25 percent of after-tax income and buy expensive shoes, no additional income taxes will be collected. No doubt sales taxes will be collected on the shoe purchases, but sales tax rates are almost always less than the income tax rate one would pay on the same amount of money. Thus, taxes discourage saving by increasing its cost relative to consumption. If the household saves anyway, it will demand a higher rate of return to compensate it for the taxes it must pay on interest earnings. Likewise, a household purchasing stocks will demand a higher and more secure rate of return on its stocks. In both cases, the cost of capital to the borrower -- to the bank or to the corporation -- has risen because of taxes.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One way for a household to save and avoid additional taxation is to purchase an asset like art or land that appreciates slowly over a very long period of time. This kind of purchase, however, also increases the economy-wide cost of capital by reducing the fund of money available to banks and businesses. Still another way to reduce the tax cost of saving is to invest in tax-advantaged funds, such as IRAs or 403(b) and 401(k) plans. These types of funds annuitize savings, which means essentially that only low-risk, long-term, low-yield to medium-yield investments will be supported by them. While they do reduce current tax liabilities, they are especially costly for the saver in two ways: In addition to shrouding these plans in penalties and taxes should they be liquidated before the saver reaches a certain age, the government has significantly discounted the future value of these savings by delaying taxes on earnings until they are at their highest level.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The unified estate and gift tax adds yet another layer of taxes on any savings decision a household makes. Successful saving always raises the possibility of creating a taxable estate, at which point the tax cost of a dollar saved increases by an amount somewhere between 7.4 cents and 55 cents. So if the household persists in its decision to save, it will require some long-term premium return on its investments roughly equal to its estimate that estate taxes will not be avoided. Naturally, this premium further increases the cost of capital.

<p><li><b>The estate tax hurts small business.</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Investing in a business is one of the many forms of saving -- for some families, the only form. For most small firms, every available dollar goes into the family business -- the dry-cleaning business, the restaurant, the trucking company -- because the business creates an asset for the children and incomes for the owners. Women re-entering the work force after raising children often find self-employment the only entry-level employment open to them. Minorities know the reasons for self-employment only too well.
</ul><p><b>
Minorities Hit Hard.</b> All of the financial security provided by these businesses is put at risk if the owner dies with a taxable estate. In an important 1995 study of how minority businesses perceive the estate tax,<sup>53</sup> Joseph Astrachan and Craig Aronoff found that:
<ul>
<p><li>Some 90 percent of the surveyed minority businesses knew that they might be subject to the federal estate tax;

<p><li>About 67 percent of these businesses had taken steps (including gifts of stock, ownership restructuring, life insurance purchases, and buy/sell agreements) to shelter their assets from taxation;

<p><li>Over 50 percent of these same businesses indicated that they would not have taken these steps had there been no estate tax; and

<p><li>Some 58 percent of all the businesses in the survey anticipated failure or great difficulty surviving after determining their estate taxes.<sup>54</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Astrachan/Aronoff study echoes findings in a 1994 study by Patrick Fleenor and J. D. Foster of the Tax Foundation, a Washington-based tax policy organization,<sup>55</sup> who presented estimates of lifetime effective tax rates for a taxable corporation, a non-corporate business, an individual earning high amounts of labor income, and a large business. In each case, Fleenor and Foster found that the presence of the estate tax raised the lifetime tax rate to a figure above 65 percent. The large business simulation determined a tax rate of 72 percent. Nearly every public finance economist of the last 50 years has concluded that tax rates of this magnitude significantly reduce the taxpayer's willingness to earn more and take entrepreneurial risk. And these two effects -- reductions in labor and in new business formation -- directly depress the rate of general economic growth, which should deeply concern everyone interested in improving economic welfare in the United States.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While Professor McCaffery appears unaware of the Fleenor/Foster study, it includes precisely the kind of evidence he has marshaled to assail the estate tax as inimical to the expansion of economic opportunity. He is not, however, unaware of Richard E. Wagner's important 1993 monograph, <i>Federal Transfer Taxation: A Study in Social Cost,</i> which ties together the many threads of this emerging theoretical canon on estate taxation.<sup>56</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Professor Wagner's study stands virtually alone in presenting macroeconomic estimates of the estate tax's effects on individual decisions to work and save. Using a model that trades labor for capital according to their relative costs and that represents this dynamic interaction through key indicators of macroeconomic activity, Wagner found that the tax premiums created by the estate tax raise the cost of capital sufficiently to reduce national output, employment, and capital stock by measurable amounts. In a simulation that modeled the U.S. economy without the current estate tax, Wagner found that:
<ul>
<p><li>Nominal gross domestic product (GDP) would have been $80 billion higher after eight years than in an economy without the estate tax;

<p><li>228,000 more jobs would have been created;

<p><li>The capital stock would have been $640 billion larger;<sup>57</sup> and

<p><li>The larger economy resulting from the repeal of estate taxes produced increases in all other taxes over the eight-year simulation period, though not quite by an amount equal to the loss of the estate tax.<sup>58</sup>
</ul><p>

<b>THE IMPACT OF REPEALING THE ESTATE TAX</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While analysts have made significant progress in understanding the microeconomic effects of intergenerational taxation, the dearth of studies similar to Wagner's shows that much work still needs to be done on measuring the tax's macroeconomic effects. It is little wonder, however, that such studies are not more numerous. As Stiglitz noted, there are many remaining questions about the tax's effects on wealth accumulation. And without a good knowledge of these effects, economists cannot create that most elementary but crucial of concepts in any tax analysis: the tax base.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Bearing in mind these limitations, the author and Heritage Foundation analysts have estimated the economic impact of repealing the estate and gift tax beginning in 1997. The Heritage analysis made certain assumptions about the effect of repeal. Each of these assumptions was introduced into two leading models of the U.S. economy: the Washington University Macro Model (WUMM) and the Mark 11 macroeconomic model of Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates.<sup>59</sup>  These two statistical models of U.S. economic activity are highly regarded, exceptionally accurate tools for estimating the effects of public policy changes on the general economy and are widely used for this purpose by America's leading corporations and government agencies.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Given the substantial doubt that annual estate tax filings fully reflect the size of the tax base,<sup>60</sup> estimates of the tax's economic effects must start from another foundation. The macroeconomic estimates presented here were built from estimates of changes in the U.S. labor force and domestic capital stocks associated with removing the estate tax portion of the after-tax cost of labor and capital. These estimates then were introduced into the macroeconomic models to compute the effects.

<p>
<b>Cost of Capital Assumptions</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
The cost of capital (the so-called rental price of investment) results from at least three factors: 1) the cost of attracting investors to supply capital funds and not do something else with their money, 2) the ratio of a capital good's depreciation relative to the value of output it produces, and 3) taxes. If a business or a household borrows money, it must pay the lender or investor enough to attract that lender or investor away from other opportunities. A portion of this "opportunity cost" payment is the tax that the lender expects to owe on the loan's earnings. Under current law, a business may offset some of this tax premium by deducting its annual depreciation and interest payments. In some cases, businesses also may claim various investment tax credits that further reduce the tax premiums they have had to pay to lenders. However, a substantial portion of the cost of operating a business is not tax deductible, and this results in a positive, residual tax premium in real-world capital costs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Of course, taxes on ordinary income constitute a substantial percentage of the tax premium in the cost of capital. Every investor attempts to earn the highest possible return on every investment so that his earnings cover the income taxes the investment incurs. The estate tax, however, also is a part of this premium. Just as households are the source of all investment funds, they also are the source of all estate taxes. When individuals begin to see that their income and investment efforts will produce a future taxable estate, they generally do two things: see a financial advisor or estate planner, and increase their earnings requirements to build the funds needed to pay the wealth transfer taxes.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Using data associating incomes with tax liabilities and holdings of corporate paper and equities, Heritage analysts estimated that the present value of future estate tax liabilities for the class of households that holds most corporate debt is slightly more than 3 percent of the average yield on corporate bonds. Thus, if corporate bonds currently yield 10 percent, eliminating wealth transfer taxes would reduce the required yield to 9.7 percent. This estimate of the estate tax component of the tax premium was used to adjust projected corporate bond yields over the period 1997 through 2005.

<p>
<b>Labor Effect Assumptions</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Economists also argue that high taxes reduce the supply of labor. At a certain point, when faced with rising taxes, workers decide to consume more leisure and produce less labor. Wealth transfer taxes are widely assumed to produce this effect, particularly among a class of individuals who clearly perceive the adverse tax consequences of working harder and building greater taxable net worth.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To capture this effect of estate taxes and introduce it into the U.S. macroeconomic model, Heritage analysts estimated the number of wage or salaried workers and self-employed individuals in this same class of households that hold most of America's corporate debt. Eliminating the estate tax would be equivalent to increasing after-tax lifetime earnings by the average effective estate tax rate, or by 18 percent. This percentage, of course, is the minimum amount of earnings change that estate tax repeal would cause: A significant but unknown amount of time and income now is devoted to positioning assets and paying accountants in order to avoid significant estate tax liabilities. This estimate also fails to capture the substantial costs borne by taxpayers and relatives when businesses fail because of estate tax liabilities. In any event, multiplying a standard labor supply elasticity of 0.3 percent by this percentage reduction in taxes, and then multiplying this product times the 18 million individuals in this class of households, yields a labor supply effect of 97,200. This number was used to adjust upwards all estimates of the civilian labor force for the period 1997 through 2005.
<p>
<b>Budget Assumptions</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Besides introducing new labor force and capital cost settings into the macroeconomic model, Heritage also made two adjustments in the federal government's budget for the period 1997 through 2005. First, the total amount of federal revenues was reduced by the forecasted amount of the estate tax. Second, expenditures for non-defense purchases were reduced by an amount exactly equal to the "lost" estate tax revenue. Thus, repealing the estate tax is assumed to be offset by spending reductions, so there is no net contribution to the deficit because of lost estate tax revenue.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is highly likely that eliminating the estate tax would result in slightly greater federal income tax receipts. Without an estate tax, taxpayers would make fewer gift transfers to their children, who commonly pay income taxes at rates lower than their parents. However, estimating the size of this effect on income tax revenues involves overcoming a host of problems raised by incomplete estate tax data. The IRS simply is unwilling to disclose important details on intergenerational giving. Thus, the following analysis does not contain estimates of the positive effects of estate tax repeal on income tax receipts. If we had made these estimates, the macroeconomic effects of repeal would have been even more positive.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By adapting the macroeconomic models in the manner described above, the resulting estate tax simulation measures the economic effects of repealing this tax on December 31, 1996. That is, it shows how differently the economy would have behaved had taxpayers not faced the prospect of estate taxes beginning in 1997. This simulated economy is compared to a "baseline" economy in which the current estate tax is still present. The differences between the baseline and simulated economies are the dynamic impacts of estate tax repeal. Again, these estimates should be viewed as a minimum assessment of the tax's economic effects.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Table 2 indicates that a stronger economy would result from the repeal of wealth transfer taxes.
<ul><p><li>
The most general measurement of economic health (GDP adjusted for inflation) quickly jumps above baseline by as much as 0.4 percent in the Heritage analysis using the WUMM. The increase in real GDP averages $11.2 billion per year over the nine-year period between 1997 and 2005. Figure 3 shows the effects on GDP caused by estate tax repeal. When the Heritage assumptions are fed into the WEFA model, the economy grows above baseline by an average of $2.83 billion over this period.<sup>61</sup>
<p><li>
Behind the growth in GDP is a strong increase in investment. A drop in the cost of capital caused by estate tax repeal leads to increased business purchases of buildings and machines. Investment in the goods that make labor more productive grows 2 percent faster between 1997 and 2005 than it otherwise would. Using the WEFA model, investment grows 0.9 percent faster over this same time period. Economists widely believe that growth in capital goods is closely related to economic growth, and that this helps explain the higher growth in GDP.
<p><li>
In addition to stimulating the growth of private investment, repealing the estate tax reduces the tax costs that workers face. Lower taxes on income are widely believed to result in a larger labor force. The Heritage estate tax simulation results in a significant growth in non-farm private employment, whichever model is used. Total non-farm employment grows by an average of 145,000 above baseline during the nine-year period using the WUMM. This growth subsides in subsequent years as wages rise to reflect the greater productivity of labor caused by the greater amount of capital per laborer. By 2003, total non-farm employment has returned to its long-term growth trend. The Heritage analysis using the WEFA model estimates average employment growth to be 86,000 over this period.
<p><li>
Not only do businesses take advantage of lower capital costs to buy new plant and equipment, but families increase their purchases of new homes. Housing starts jump sharply during the first two years after repeal. The Heritage simulation using the WUMM model predicts that estate tax repeal would lead to a first-year increase of 49,000 in housing starts. This effect is caused by a significant drop in the mortgage interest rate. The fact that it does not drop more in subsequent years explains why housing starts return to baseline after the third year following repeal.
<p><li>
The boost in housing and the growth in business investment expenditures reflect the lower capital costs that result from removing the estate tax premium on capital. The cost of corporate capital and the secondary mortgage rate fall by an average of 21 and 27 basis points, respectively, in the Heritage analysis using the WUMM. While this decline is less dramatic in the WEFA model, the user cost of capital remains solidly below baseline throughout the nine-year period. As economic activity builds following repeal of the estate tax, demand for capital rises, leading to small increases in both the long bond rate and the federal funds rate. Subtle elevations in these market lending rates would be the expected result in an economy that is adding more jobs and creating more capital goods than an economy still burdened by high tax rates.
<p><li>
The growth in household income also supports the increase in housing starts. Between 1997 and 2005, inflation-adjusted household disposable income (broadly, what is left after taxes) grows by an average of $12 billion per year in the Heritage analysis using the WUMM model. Similar growth also occurs in total personal income, which increases by an average of $8 billion per year. Both of these income indicators rise because of higher levels of employment, greater worker productivity, and stronger household and business consumption. The WEFA model shows inflation-adjusted disposable income rising by an average of $9 billion per year and personal income growing by an average of $5 billion per year over this nine-year period.
<p><li>
Despite the loss of $15 billion in annual revenue and $15 billion less in government spending, the federal deficit does not worsen over this nine-year period. In fact, the WUMM simulation shows that a stronger economy leads to deficit improvement. For each of the first seven years in the estate tax simulation, the deficit is slightly less after estate tax repeal than in an economy with an estate tax. During the last two years of the simulation, higher interest rates cause a gentle rise in federal expenditures. Te WEFA simulation indicates minor deficit changes throughout the nine-year period. Both simulations, however, point to the same conclusion: The economic benefits from estate tax repeal should not be sacrificed because of concerns about a federal deficit.
</ul><p><b>
CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is easy in this season of big tax reform proposals to overlook the federal estate tax. This tax, after all, is a relatively minor source of federal revenue that has been declining for the past 20 years. Indeed, many of those involved in the ongoing tax policy debate simply ignore it.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This is a mistake. As this study has shown, the economic cost of the estate tax is many times greater than the revenue it produces, and its reach into American households extends far beyond those few which pay it. Every day, social and economic decisions are made with the estate tax in mind. Minority businesspeople suffer anxious moments wondering whether the savings they have built in their businesses, and that they plan to hand to their children, will be destroyed by the estate tax bill. Poor people, for whom the estate tax has no immediacy, wonder at the scarcity of entry-level jobs or the absence of low-cost educational loans. Factories drone on with worn-out equipment that would be replaced if capital costs fell. Women who have raised their children struggle to find ways to re-enter the work force without upsetting the family's estate tax avoidance plan. Rich people buy vacations in Vail and fine art in Lisbon, rather than new businesses that create jobs and incomes, because the government has a claim on more than half of everything they cannot spend.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The estate and gift tax does much to perpetuate the social and economic distortions produced generally by taxes on income. Should Congress repeal this tax, however, the result would be a growing economy, more abundant jobs, and offices and factories with the kind of new equipment that elevates productivity and supports higher wages. Lower capital costs also would mean new small businesses, which traditionally have served as economic havens for minority families and launching pads for young workers. By repealing the estate and gift tax, Congress would be making significant progress toward creating a tax policy that complements rather than undermines other efforts to expand economic opportunity by creating a growing economy.

    There is little foundation for a claim that the U.S. government levied taxes on incomes in 1914 because it needed additional revenues.

    However, the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (DFRA) extended until 1988 a 55 percent top tax rate that had been scheduled to fall to 50 percent in 1985. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 introduced a tougher penalty on generation-skipping wealth transfers by taxing all such transfers at the top marginal rate of 55 percent. And the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 further forestalled the fall in the top tax rate until the end of 1992.

    "Fair market value" apparently means the value of an asset that a fully informed buyer would pay in a market for the asset. The concept implies the existence of a willing seller and able buyer, which is rarely the case when an estate is valued for tax purposes. Thus, executors must rely on various proxy prices for an estate's assets, such as recent closing prices for stocks and bonds and property sales of similar assets that are contemporary with the death of the decedent. The value of "good will" is a particularly vexing problem in estate tax valuation. Due to the numerous artifices that executors and courts must employ to place a value on estates, the resulting "gross estate" frequently bears little relationship to its market value. For example, an estate consisting solely of art that has been held for many years may have little market value if the tastes of the art-buying public have changed dramatically during the holding period.
<p><li>
    While "fair market value" at the time of death is the most common method of quantifying a decedent's death, an executor of an estate paying tax can elect an alternative valuation date that is somewhat earlier or six months after the date of death. This alternative date method applies particularly to estates dominated by bonds or stocks in companies whose value is significantly affected by the death of the decedent. See 26 U.S.C. Secs. 2031(a) and 2032(a).

    This Study was prepared by The Heritage Foundation using tax simulation models developed by The Heritage Foundation and the Washington University Macro Model and the Mark 11 U.S. Macro Model of Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates. The methodologies, assumptions, conclusions, and opinions herein are entirely those of The Heritage Foundation. They have not been endorsed by, and do not necessarily reflect the views of, the owners of these two macroeconomic models.
<p><li>
    From an economic standpoint, a tax's base is composed of some quantifiable behavior that is being affected by the tax. The estate tax base could be viewed as the sum of all those dollars that are managed annually so as to avoid paying the tax, plus those that end up on a tax form.
<p><li>
     Even though these two estimates of additional GDP are different, the two models indicate the same general result: The economy grows more without the estate tax. The outputs of econometric models often differ, even when employing the very same assumptions, because of subtle differences in the theoretical viewpoints upon which the models are constructed. After all, such models are intended to give analysts insight into how changes in specific economic relationships affect the macroeconomy. The differences between the two models used in this study stem largely from WUMM's greater emphasis on the rental price of investment as a driver of economic activity.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress is now considering repealing the 4.3 cent federal tax imposed under the 1993 budget plan championed by the Clinton Administration.  Gasoline prices at service stations across the country have risen sharply over the last few months, raising concerns over the impact of these rising prices on already strained family budgets.  Nationally, since the beginning of the year, gas prices have risen approximately 16 cents.  In California, where prices have risen even more dramatically, gasoline now costs more than $2 a gallon in some areas.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While recent gas price hikes are an unwelcome added cost to family budgets, they actually are far exceeded by the total gas taxes paid by Americans.  Combined federal and state gas taxes per gallon of gasoline now average 37.7 cents, more than twice the recent short-term spike caused by market conditions.  These taxes raise the cost of driving a car an average of $310 per year.  In response to the growing public concern over prices and the economic impact of the tax burden, Senator Phil Gramm (R-TX) introduced a <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:S.1727:">bill</a> on May 2 which would repeal the 1993 federal fuel tax of 4.3 cents applying to gasoline and diesel.  Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) also is expected soon to offer a bill that will repeal the gas and diesel tax and possibly may roll back the 4.3 cent tax on jet fuel as well.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Eliminating the 1993 gas tax is a good start.  While gasoline would still be subject to a 14 cent federal tax, as well as substantial state taxes, repealing the 4.3 cent tax would benefit the economy by reducing transportation costs.  It also would help family budgets.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Unlike the rest of the federal gasoline tax, the 4.3 cent levy is not earmarked for transportation costs.  It flows instead into general revenues.  As Senator Dole has said, at least the previous gasoline taxes "helped build highways and bridges, but this tax was just for deficit reduction.  It doesn't do a thing for highways or bridges.... If we repeal this tax, it'll be 4 cents cheaper at the pump.  If we can find an offset, then we should repeal this tax."  Melvin Sherbert, Chairman of the Legislative Committee of the National Service Station Dealers and owner of two service stations himself, confirmed that tax savings would be passed on directly to consumers.  Sherbert testified on May 3 before theSenate Finance Committee that "We would pass the savings on because we are just waiting to lower prices [because] that helps us sell more gas while still making the same profit [per gallon]."<sup>1</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The poor and lower middle class would be the biggest beneficiaries of this repeal.  Susan Perry, Senior Vice President of the American Bus Association, testified on May 3 before the Senate Finance Committee that as the result of higher fuel costs since the imposition of the fuel tax, "there are fewer bus stops [and] the very poor, very elderly and very rural are mostly affected" because they disproportionately ride buses and fuel costs are passed on to passengers.<sup>2</sup>  Moreover, since the fuel tax is a flat 4.3 cents per gallon, it is regressive.  Because three-quarters of those Americans earning less than $10,000 per year commute to work in privately owned autos, a flat tax rate falls disproportionately on these poor as a percent of their income.<sup>3</sup>  Indeed, 1987 Bureau of Labor statistics data show that the poorest 20 percent of Americans devote 8.8 percent of their expenditures to gasoline and motor oil while the wealthiest 20 percent devote only 3.1 percent of their expenditures to gasoline and motor oil.<sup>4</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The benefit to the economy of repealing the fuel tax would be significant.  Carol Hallett, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Air Transport Association of America, testified that the airline "industry estimates that passing on this [4.3 cents per gallon tax] cost results in five million fewer passengers a year [due to higher ticket prices.  This] correlates to a loss of 1 passenger per flight.  This statistic alone is enough to drop many flights into the loss column, and will surely result in airlines cutting back."<sup>5</sup>  And according to the trucking industry, the 4.3 cent tax adds about $600 per truck annually to the cost of operations.<sup>6</sup>  These costs in turn are largely passed on to consumers in the form of higher priced products.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The burden of this tax for 1996 is $5.3 billion for gasoline alone and $7.4 billion total, based on Department of Energy daily use estimates.<sup>7</sup>  Too often ignored, however, is the regional and state disparity in the impact of this tax.  To assess the state-by-state impact of the 4.3 cent tax on motor, distillate, and jet fuel, we calculated the tax for each state based on Department of Energy state summaries of usage patterns for 1993, the most recent year for which complete data are available.<sup>8</sup>  While the pattern among states may have changed slightly between 1993 and today, the estimates of the tax burden in general would be higher than our state-by-state figures because of increases in consumption.<sup>9</sup>  According to this calculation, the drain on California alone is $772 million based on 1993 usage, while New York and Pennsylvania combined, with about the same number of people, have a cost of $586 million.

April 8, 1996<br>
<p>
<b>WALTER WILLIAMS:</b> I'm going to talk about the morality of taxation and, of course, the flat tax. While we're talking about taxation, I am going to spend most of my time raising some moral issues involved with taxation in general. Whether we like to think of it as such, our fiscal problems, as well as many other problems in our country, are rooted in immoral government conduct.
<p>

Let me start by referring to the United States Constitution, what I prefer to call the "citizen's rule book."  To say something meaningful about taxation, one must also say something about expenditures, and Article 1, Section 8 of our Constitution is very relevant to today's discussion. Article 1, Section 8 begins by granting Congress authority to lay and collect taxes. In the passages that follow, if you read carefully, Article 1, Section 8 enumerates a broad range of about 19 activities for which Congress can use its taxing authority. These 19 activities, for those of us who have not bothered to read the Constitution lately, include a common defense, the coining of money, and the establishment of post offices and courts, among other things.
<p>
I have not done the numbers on this, but I am guessing that the amount of money necessary for Congress to pay for these constitutionally authorized functions of the federal government would come to no more than $400 billion or so at the most. Obviously, that amount differs significantly from today's expenditure level of $1.6 trillion, and even that $1.6 trillion does not capture the total spending because we have the underground federal government, the so-called off-budget expenditures, as well as government-mandated spending by citizens, such as Americans with Disabilities Act, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and Environmental Protection Agency dictates.
<p>

I do not believe that we can restore government to its proper role in a free society by focusing our energies only on the taxation part of the equation. In saying this, I in no way wish to demean the yeoman-like efforts of all those who have worked to come up with a better method of taxation. But I see much of the debate between the flat tax and the national sales tax or our current tax code as boiling down to a question of which is the best way for government to subjugate its citizens (although this is not a meaningless question, because if we have to accept subjugation, I suppose some forms are better than others).
<p>

The debate over what form of taxation we should have somewhat legitimates the level of government spending; and I have always argued, as a number of colleagues have, that it is spending, not taxation, that is the true measure of the burden of government. You see this by recognizing that there is no necessary reason why government has to tax in the first place. At one extreme, Congress could raise all the resources it needed simply by printing currency, or could borrow and require its citizens and other entities to hold a portion of their holdings in government securities, as is done in some countries. Of course, there would be severe problems associated with either one of these methods of taxation, but the bottom-line point is that government spending, not taxation, is the proper measure of government activity, and that is the major problem that needs to be addressed.
<p>

Throughout most of our nation's history, up to the beginning of the 20th century, the federal government spent no more than 3 or 4 percent of GNP, except during wartime. It did not make much difference what form of taxation supported federal government activity. In fact, excise taxes carried the burden. But even during this interval, and even if we had had today's income tax code, there would not have been much of a problem raising 3 or 4 percent of GNP. Almost any kind of tax system would not have much of a problem raising 3 or 4 percent of GNP. I am sure that if that were still the case, we would not be gathered here today to discuss substituting a flat tax for the current code.
<p>

Some people might ask, and some Congressmen might ask, what forms of congressional spending should be cut so that we would not have to worry about the form of taxation. A French philosopher, Frederic Bastiat, gave us the best guide in a little book called <I>The Law</I>, wherein he suggested a way of identifying legal plunder. Bastiat said -- and you can think about our government while I am reading this quote -- "See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them and gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong. See if the law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what that citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime."
<p>

Clearly, at least two-thirds of federal spending fits Bastiat's description of legal plunder, what I prefer to call legalized theft. If we eliminated legal plunder from the scope of congressional activity, the form of taxation could easily be a non-issue; that is, getting us back to 3 or 4 percent of the GNP. Some may wish to quarrel with my description of Congress's business as being that of legal plunder, but just ask yourself: How does Congress get the money for farm subsidy programs, the savings and loan bailout, food stamps, and the like?  Clearly, it uses intimidation, threats, and coercion to take what rightfully belongs to one citizen and give it to another to whom it does not belong.
<p>

If you think I'm being too loose with terminology about intimidation, threats, and coercion, think about April 15. The mission of virtually every Cabinet department in this city is to distribute the loot that Congress collects. There is neither moral nor constitutional authority for Congress to commit plunder. That is the moral issue that we need to address.
<p>

Turning to the Armey-Shelby flat tax proposal, notwithstanding what I have argued so far, there are some benefits to its enactment. First, it would reduce Congress's ability to grant one group of Americans special tax privileges that are denied to another group of Americans. The House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee are two of the most powerful committees in Congress. Their members have the largest political war chest, and the reason is that they are the focus of Washington's lobbying groups, who pay handsomely and work diligently to have favors bestowed upon them. The Armey-Shelby flat tax plan would go a long way toward eliminating privilege-granting by the United States Congress, and that may explain some of the political resistance to having a flat tax.
<p>

Another benefit of the Armey-Shelby flat tax is lower compliance costs. According to various estimates, the compliance costs of our current code include the 5.5 billion to 6 billion hours Americans spend on such activity as recordkeeping, filling out tax forms, going to court, and seeking ways to avoid taxes. The Armey-Shelby flat tax would create a GNP windfall because if Americans were spending those tax compliance hours in productive activity, the country would be considerably richer. Current tax compliance costs are estimated to be equal to the entire annual output of the automobile and truck and aircraft industries combined.
<p>

As evidenced by my remarks, I am a purist -- what the news media, and maybe even some of you, might call an extremist. But I am not such a purist that I cannot see that a flat tax is a major improvement over the status quo.
<p>

If a flat tax is enacted, however, there should be an additional paragraph in the law requiring a supermajority, say four-fifths, to raise it and a simple majority to decrease it. Like the Framers of our Constitution, I do not trust the Congress of the United States. With the current complex tax code, there are numerous legal ways to hide our money from the revenuers. With a simple flat tax, those hideaways would be eliminated. Then, if Congress raised taxes, we would be up that proverbial creek without a paddle.
<p>

<b>J. KENNETH BLACKWELL:</b> <I>The New York Times</I>, in a 1909 editorial opposing the very first income tax, predicted that when men get in the habit of helping themselves to the property of others, they cannot easily be cured of it. The history of our tax code, in economic terms, mirrors the course of most addictions: first, advancing dependence; second, diminished returns; and third, deteriorating health of the afflicted. <p>

The 1.9 percent rate of economic growth experienced by the U.S. economy is not an accident. It is caused in large measure by a tax code that is impossibly complex, overly intrusive, manifestly unfair, and economically destructive. While some people oppose tax increases or favor tax reductions simply because they want to maintain or enhance their disposable income, I favor constraining government taxation because of the negative impact it has on economic growth.
<p>

Higher taxes mean lower rates of growth in income and jobs over time. This has been amply demonstrated in dozens of scholarly studies. Perhaps the most exhaustive recent study was performed by Dr. Richard Vedder of Ohio University for the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. Looking at the tax history and economic performance of 50 American states for the period 1960 to 1993, Professor Vedder concluded that relatively low-tax states grew nearly one-third faster than high-tax states.
<p>

Income taxes have a particularly adverse impact on income growth. Flat rate income taxes are significantly more favorable to economic growth than progressive taxes. Perhaps income in flat rate income tax states grew about 25 percent faster than did personal income in states with progressive tax structures. Professor Vedder lists over 50 other studies that similarly conclude that taxes adversely impact economic performance, whether measured by income growth, job creation, new business startups, or population change. These studies look at areas within the U.S. during a given period of time or, in many cases, at other countries. <p>


For example, one study of 107 nations by researchers at the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded, "We find that a balanced budget increase in government spending and taxation is predicted to reduce output growth rates."  Given that, it is desirable to provide a legal framework for fiscal policymaking in Washington that removes the bias that exists in the current system in favor of relatively large government and, thus, high taxation. Special-interest groups can and do use their concentrated financial and political power to overcome the general interest on a continuous basis, leading to spending in excess of desirable levels, as Walter has just demonstrated. By making it more difficult to tax the populace, we can reduce the fiscal drag on our long-term economic performance that high federal taxation imposes. This is a strong argument for a supermajority requirement for legislative approval of tax increases.
<p>

The current federal tax system provides perverse economic incentives to states and local governments. Because state and local income tax payments are deductible against federal adjusted income, state governments are encouraged to levy income rather than other forms of taxes or no taxes at all. Consider two otherwise identical families, both making $75,000 in income, one living in New York and the other living in Texas or Florida. The New York family probably pays $4,000 or more in state and local income taxes, while the Florida or Texas counterpart pays nothing. Because of federal tax deductibility, the New York family probably will pay close to $1,000 less in federal income taxes.
<p>

This is terribly unfair. It violates the concept of horizontal equity, a concept that says that people of similar economic circumstances should pay similar taxes. Beyond that, however, the federal government is subsidizing the citizens of states that engage in very high-tax policies, shown by Professor Vedder and many others to be so destructive of economic growth. The elimination or reduction of that federal deductibility, such as would occur with a pure flat tax, would increase pressures on high-tax states to reduce their income taxes, which would spur economic growth, something that most states in this union desperately need and desire. This, in addition to the economic stimulus that would come from lowering the federal marginal income tax rates, would be a tremendous boon to our nation's economy.
<p>

Moreover, the move to a lower, flat rate federal income tax fits with another theme that virtually everyone in both political parties is supporting, at least rhetorically: the devolution of power back to the states. The current tax code says, in effect, that Washington knows best. States that have high income taxes are considered good, progressive jurisdictions, so Washington rewards their citizens with lower taxes. States that raise revenues more by sales taxes, excise taxes, or user fees are punished relative to states that use high income or property levies. Rather than being neutral on state fiscal policy, Washington is trying to use financial incentives to dictate the nature of taxation.
<p>

What is particularly perverse about this is that the form of taxation Washington is trying to dictate has a particularly adverse impact on growth. Washington is telling the states to tax the production of goods, or the resources used to produce goods, rather than the consumption of income. That is economically wrong; it is inconsistent with empowering states and local governments to do what they feel is best for their citizens. We have an opportunity in this public policy-defining year to set the record straight: to junk the present tax code and replace it with a tax code that positions us for the 21st century.
<p>

When I was 14, I thought I was God's gift to amateur boxing. I won my first four bouts with relative ease. The fifth bout, I got hit so hard in the nose that I had to go home and tell my father that I was going to find a more scholarly career to pursue. I stayed away from the boxing arena until I was a freshman at Xavier University, where Father E. J. O'Connor, a 72-year-old Jesuit, would ask me and a friend of mine, Benji, if we would go to the amateur bouts with him at the old Cincinnati Gardens. We went out and watched 10 bouts. The 11th bout, a young boy from the western side of Cincinnati, also of Irish-Catholic heritage, came out and, before his fight, made the sign of the cross. Benji leaned over and said, "Father, what's the significance of that?"  Father said, "Tiger, it ain't enough if you can't fight."
<p>

I would suggest to you that it is time for us, as the revolutionaries at the grass roots, to move beyond lip service and get into action, put some muscle behind our rhetoric, and make sure that the Congress of the United States creates a tax code and a tax structure that spur economic growth, create jobs, and promote hope and opportunity.
<p>

<b>JOHN FUND:</b> Two dates are very significant to Americans every spring. One, of course, is April 15, when Americans have to wade through all of their tax forms and fill them out. The other one is May 6, which is Tax Freedom Day. That is the day when the average American family will have earned enough to pay its federal, state, and local taxes and begin keeping money for food, clothing, shelter, and all of the things that keep body and soul together.
<p>

The two dates are linked because we have the tax system that we have, because it is overly complex, and because it raises far too much money. Right now, only 29 percent of Americans fill out the tax form that requires itemization; 52 percent of Americans actually have to go and pay someone, a professional, to fill out those forms for them. If you fill out the form 1040, 66 percent of Americans have to pay a professional. There is something wrong with a tax system which requires people to get somebody with an accountant's training to fill out a tax form for them.
<p>

If you go further and look at its intrusiveness, the IRS employs 111,000 people. That is more people than work for the FBI; that is more people than work for the Border Patrol; that is more people than work for the Drug Enforcement Administration, the CIA, and the National Security Agency all combined. It is an enormous apparatus. It is said that perhaps the least believable thing you can say in this country is "I'm from the government, and I'm here to help you."  Well, perhaps the most believable thing someone can say in this country is "I'm from the IRS, and I'm here to hurt you."
<p>

Everyone across both political parties recognizes that this system is broken, cannot be fixed, and is irredeemable. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt put it, I think, better than anyone: The tax system has become a test of legal brainpower and the ability of accountants to conduct a treasure hunt for hidden deductions and tax breaks. Our tax code has become a dense fog of incentives, inducements, and penalties that distort the most basic economic decisions, constrain the free market, and make it hard for Americans to run their own lives.
<p>

The IRS has become the very symbol of what is wrong with the American government. In order to clean it up, proposals are laid on the table like the flat tax. The flat tax is a way to shrink the IRS from the monolithic and intractable bureau it is today to a simple clearinghouse of information.
<p>

The flat tax as a concept, of course, is enormously popular. The flat tax was attacked mercilessly by almost every candidate in the Republican Party because it was the proposal by Steve Forbes that was most identified with his candidacy. In order to attack Steve Forbes and slow his momentum, you had to attack the flat tax. But the exit polls which were taken as Republican primary voters left the polling booth found that in 18 out of 22 primary states, the flat tax was still supported by a majority or plurality of people voting in those primaries. It received the equivalent of a political mugging, but it is still standing and walking around.
<p>

There are a lot of people who say the flat tax is a far distant goal. Well, not if you look in contemporary political terms. The flat tax was introduced to the American people on the editorial page of <I>The Wall Street Journal</I> on March 25, 1981, just over 15 years ago, in a famous essay by Bob Hall and Alvin Rabushka called "The Attraction of a Flat Rate System."  It has picked up adherents ever since. There are now two books on the bestseller list that discuss the flat tax, one by House Majority Leader Dick Armey. It is gathering momentum.
<p>

It is not surprising that it has taken us 15 years to get this far. I think Mr. Blackwell mentioned the first income tax. That was not really the first income tax; that was the first income tax that actually stuck. The first income tax was a peacetime income tax that came about in 1894. It was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, which said that you had to have a constitutional amendment to have such a tax. That effort took from 1894 to 1913, when we passed the Sixteenth Amendment -- 19 years; that is about how long it takes an idea that has irresistible political support behind it to come to realization in America. So I'm not surprised it has taken us 15 years to get this far. At the same time, I also would not be surprised if it takes us only four or five more years to achieve something like the flat tax, because this system is broken and is reaching a critical state of collapse.
<p>

There is another proposal on the table which I think is as significant as the flat tax, and which will be voted on in the House of Representatives on April 15. It has been referred to as the supermajority for raising taxes. This would mean that, as 10 or 11 states now do, you would require two-thirds of the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate to pass a general tax increase. This is an insurance policy to make certain that, once again, the Constitution will have shape and form and will carry with it the force of law. As it is right now, the Constitution has been interpreted virtually into nothingness, as I think Walter Williams indicates.
<p>

We need something more dramatic than what the Founding Fathers envisioned. We need the supermajority, the two-thirds, to raise taxes. Couple that with a simple flat rate system and I think you will have a powerful engine for economic growth, a powerful engine for simplifying people's lives, and a powerful blow for civil liberties in this country. If we achieve either or both of these goals, the supermajority or the flat tax, I think there will come a day when the American people can say that April 15, more or less, is just like any other day -- and wouldn't that be a blessed relief?
<p>

<b>STEVE FORBES:</b> It is good to be here today, to see the flat tax discussed in an environment where you are seeking after truth rather than sound bites.
 I hope it is a theme that others will be picking up in the fall.

Everything we proposed in this year's presidential campaign, particularly the flat tax, had as its purpose -- it sounds like a clich, but it's the truth -- to help realize the American dream, which in its essence allows all of us the chance to discover and develop to the fullest our God-given talents. Anything that stands in the way of that, we resisted. Anything that promotes it, we supported. The flat tax is the first of many critical issues that came out of the campaign that will make it possible for America to realize its full potential -- as a people and as a nation.
<p>

One of the things that pundits occasionally do, and historians will do forever, is discuss why Americans were in a sour mood in the 1990s. After all, the standard of living, by any objective measure, is a bit higher than it was in the 1970s or even parts of the 1980s; we did win the 40-year Cold War; we are living longer; the world is looking to the U.S. for leadership. So why are we in a sour mood?
<p>

The answer is simple: We are not fulfilling our potential as a people and as a nation. One of the dangers of this era is that it will be known as the era of missed opportunities. Never in history, and certainly in the 20th century for this country, has a nation had a chance to do more things of a positive nature at home and to be an example of good overseas. Even in 1914, before the first World War, we were simply one of a number of powers in the world. People did look to us, but they looked to other nations and empires as well.
<p>

When the 20th century began, people felt that in spite of all of the problems in the world, this would be an age of material abundance. The rule of law would advance. Even autocratic Russia was beginning to lumber -- haltingly, fitfully, but in the right direction -- toward a constitutional monarchy. Then came the First World War. The devastation of that seemingly senseless loss of life undermined, in the minds of many, the foundations of Western civilization. The rise of communism in Russia, fascism in Italy, and Nazism in Germany following the First World War helped plant the seeds of the Great Depression and, of course, the Second World War. Now, with the Cold War over, we once again have a chance, at least in spirit, to go back to the optimism that began this century.
<p>

In America today is this mindset that we can't grow economically more than 2 percent or 2.5 percent, which is absolutely preposterous. Overseas, countries are looking to us. They want to know: How do we make the transition to a free-market economy?  How do we make it possible for liberty to sink real roots and not be uprooted as happened in the aftermath of World War I?
<p>

We should keep in mind, for example, that in the 1920s and early 1930s democracy was the prevalent form of government in much of the world. Yet, without external aggression, simply because of internal weakness and because the world did not create an environment to make it possible for democracy to sink real roots, democracy in Europe collapsed almost everywhere -- Central Europe, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Greece, Turkey, and Italy. Everywhere you looked, most ominously in Germany and then in Asia because of Japan, democracy quickly collapsed.
<p>

Today we have an opportunity, not for a New World Order where we have direction from above, but to liberate the imagination and energies of people around the world. They are looking for guidance on how to do it, and we have so far failed abysmally in being an example of good -- not only at home but also overseas.
<p>

So the flat tax is a means to an end. This is something that I think our brethren on Capitol Hill have to get used to: that when they explain the issues, such as balancing the budget, they must never forget that the balanced budget is not simply a goal unto itself. It is a means to an end. Otherwise, we sound like accountants looking at numbers as numbers and not as representing real people dealing with real-life problems. That is why the Republicans lost the moral high ground last fall in the confrontation with the White House, and now we have to get that moral high ground back again.
<p>

The flat tax is the first means to revitalizing the American dream. It is no secret to most of you in this room that the tax code today is a monstrous deadweight on American life. It is the principal reason why two incomes in the family can't do the job that one income did in previous generations. As many of you know, a typical family today pays eight times as much in federal income tax on each dollar of income as a typical family did 40 years ago.
<p>

You see the effects of this deadweight in our slow-growth economy. It's not just because the Federal Reserve believes in the crazy Phillips curve that we can't grow more than 2.5 percent without triggering inflation. It is because taxes are not only a means of collecting revenue; taxes are also a price we pay: A tax on income, a tax on profit, a tax on capital gains is a price we pay for working; a price we pay for being innovative, imaginative, and successful. And as we know, when the price of those good things is too high, we are going to get less of them; when the price is lower, we get more of them.
<p>

Yet that seemingly simple insight is lost in policymaking circles in this town. When the Republicans took control of Congress a little over a year ago, they had a chance to get a dynamic model in place in the Congressional Budget Office, but instead they let the opportunity pass by. I remember before I got into the race, when I was with Empower America, I asked one of my opponents, "Why aren't you going for some form of dynamic model?"  "Well, Steve," he said in a tone that only a professor could adopt with a wayward student, "if we keep this old model, that means in order to get tax cuts, we're gonna have to cut spending even more."  He didn't realize that without a dynamic model, you'll get the tax cuts, but at the end of the day you won't get the spending changes as well.
<p>

What the Republicans must remember -- if they ever knew it -- is that if you are going to get long-term changes in Washington, if you're ever going to get serious cuts in spending, serious downsizing and reorganization of government, you must have an environment where fear is not prevalent, where people see that their lives are dramatically improving, that opportunities are there. Then voters will give you the political capital if you wish to use that capital to make those difficult long-term changes. That simple insight is seemingly lost in too many quarters of our party: You will not get economic growth unless you get rid of these high tax rates, and the most effective, dramatic way to get rid of them is with the flat tax.
<p>

But the tax code is also the principal source of power in Washington. For a couple of generations now the favorite activity has been trading loopholes, trading favors for political support and contributions. All you have to do is look at those graphs in Dan Mitchell's book to see what members of tax-writing committees get in contributions versus what their brethren on other committees in Congress get.<sup>1</sup>  The same thing is true of the state legislatures. The current tax code is the principal source of political pollution and corruption in Washington.
<p>

Today, as we all know, even the tax collector doesn't understand what's in the tax code. Half the time, if you call the IRS, even the IRS doesn't know what's in there; but if you take the IRS's advice and it's wrong, you're held responsible for it.
<p>

I liked to point out in my campaign that the Gettysburg Address is a little over 200 words; the American Declaration of Independence, 1,300 words; the Holy Bible, 773,000 words: the federal income tax code, 7 million words and rising. That puts the tax code in perspective. There's no way to "ER" this thing. You can't reform it. You really can't cut around the edges. The only thing you can do with this monstrosity is to scrap it, drive a stake through it, bury it, and hope it never rises again to terrorize the American taxpayer. There is no other way.
<p>

Let me briefly outline what my flat tax plan is. One of the most astonishing things that came out of this campaign was what people thought my plan was or what it was reported to be -- not what it actually was. <p>


The great virtue of the flat tax, in addition to its simplicity, is that it has generous exemptions for adults and children. An adult, for example, would get a $13,000 tax deduction; each child, $5,000. Also, the flat tax is a tax cut; I'll state that up front. When you're on the campaign trail, reporters expect you to say this isn't revenue neutral. No, my plan is not revenue neutral. And they ask with horror, "Why isn't it revenue neutral?"
<p>

"Revenue neutral" gets to the heart of the problem: the attitude that the nation exists to feed the appetite of Washington. What I tried to make clear on the campaign trail was that there are occasions when Washington should have to adjust to the needs of the nation, and under my flat tax plan, it would do just that. With generous exemptions -- $13,000 for an adult, $5,000 for each child -- for the first time since withholding was invented in 1942, millions of Americans would be removed from the federal income tax rolls.
<p>

With those exemptions, for example, a couple would pay no tax on their first $26,000 of income. For a family of four with two kids, it would be the first $36,000. With three kids, it would be $41,000. There are not many families of four in America, outside of a few major centers, that would have $36,000 of tax deductions under the current system. So the flat tax would remove millions of people.
<p>

Any income above those exemptions would be taxed at a simple flat rate of 17 percent. There would be no tax on the personal level -- on your pension, Social Security, personal savings, capital gains, or inheritance. For business, it would be equally simple. Obviously, the transition issues are much more complicated; it would take several years to phase in, especially on the business side. But once it was phased in, you would have a 17 percent rate on the net, and then investments would be written off, expensed in year one: no more ever-changing, complicated depreciation schedules. It makes no sense in this high-tech, information, micro-chip age for Congress, the IRS, the tax courts, or the government as a whole to dictate to entrepreneurs and executives the life of an asset -- to put an arbitrary life on an asset. That should be a business decision, not the government's.
<p>

That is, in essence, the flat tax, or my version of it. The good points of it I thought were self-evident. With that 17 percent rate, we'd get a true boom in the economy -- one that would dwarf even that of the early 1960s when we had growth rates that people today would say are impossible to achieve. In the early 1960s through the mid-1960s up to the Vietnam War, the economy grew almost 5 percent in real terms. That is the kind of growth rate, given the fundamentals of America today, that I think we can achieve again, not forever, but for several years as we begin to bring our new technologies on-line.
<p>

The flat tax is also a fair system because if you make more, you pay more. It is also postcard simple, which was, I thought, a very attractive feature. It is also honest; it rips away the principal source of political pollution and corruption in the nation's capital; and if we can do that in D.C., I guarantee you, you'll quickly do it in most of the 50 states.
<p>

What, then, were the arguments against something that would do so much good for America?  I hate to repeat them here, because many of you know that they are not really valid, but we will be hit with these arguments as this debate heats up.
<p>

First, critics said the flat tax would hurt or clobber housing. Only in Washington would people believe that a pro-growth overhaul of the tax code would somehow be a disaster for housing. After all, you get to keep more of what you earn, you don't have your personal savings taxed, so it's easier to put together a downpayment for a house. Even the Clinton Treasury Department acknowledges that the flat tax would mean lower interest rates, which would translate into lower mortgage rates. And realtors know that the principal determinant of a person's or couple's buying a house is the monthly payment. That is the key factor, and with lower interest rates you would have even lower monthly payments.
<p>

Put these three factors together -- more money in the pocket (not to mention the opportunity for better-paying jobs in the future), an easier-to-put-together downpayment, and lower monthly mortgage payments. How is that a disaster for housing?  No one ever explained it to me, certainly not the realtors. The bogus study they drew on came from one of Forbes magazine's competitors. I will admit I have a vested interest in downgrading DRI/McGraw-Hill, but, in the study they assumed a flat tax rate of 22 percent to 25 percent, not the 17 percent I was talking about.
<p>

Critics said it would be bad for charities. The blunt fact of the matter is that in America, when people have more, they give more. With a flat tax, we'd have more and would be persuaded to give more. The United States is known as a charitable, generous nation; Alexis de Tocqueville talked about it 160 years ago, long before we had a federal income tax.
<p>

Nay-sayers said it would be bad for municipal bond holders because other forms of debt would not be taxed directly to individuals and this would be bad for municipal bonds. No, it would not hurt the price of municipal bonds. When the general level of interest rates goes down, it does not hurt the principle value of municipal bonds.
<p>

What it would mean -- and this is what the issuers of municipal bonds hated -- is more accountability. You know and I know that when you buy a munibond, the only thing you want to know about is does it have a good rating, does it have insurance. Then you buy it. You don't look very hard at what's behind that bond. Well, the issuers of munibonds would not have that advantage anymore, and those products would get the same kind of examination that other forms of debt get -- not a bad thing in terms of political accountability. But in terms of hurting the principle value of the bonds, it wouldn't. If anything, once the flat tax was in place, the price of municipal bonds would probably go up a little bit. What's wrong with that?
<p>

Then the carpers said it would hurt the middle class. Somebody just showed me an item from Sunday's <I>Washington Times.</I> Dick Gephardt is flogging that crazy notion again. He says Dick Armey's plan, which is not much different from mine, will hurt the middle class, raise its taxes several thousand dollars. You know how they can make that statement?  They assume that it will be a flat 17 percent rate on all your income. No exemptions; they leave out the $36,000 of exemptions (in Armey's case, the first $31,000 or $33,000 of exemptions). They leave that out. So a family of four making $45,000 a year, according to Dick Gephardt, would owe a tax of $7,000. You know what the real tax would be under my variation of the flat tax?  About $1,600. Under Dick Armey's, $2,000. Millions of people would be removed from the tax rolls, but that fact also got lost in the shuffle during the campaign.
<p>

Critics said the flat tax would give advantages to rich people, because investment income would not be taxed. As you know, investment income would be taxed, only it would be taxed at the source, at the corporate level. Now, why it was considered populist to say that businesses should not write the checks to the government, that individuals should write the checks to the government, I have not been able to figure out. To give business the tax break, but not the individual, somehow was seen as liberal. Even Pat Buchanan was talking about lounge lizards in Miami getting these breaks.
<p>

For those of you not familiar with the arguments, let me reassure you: Investment income is taxed, only it's taxed at the business level. Businesses write the checks to the IRS, which means the IRS gets the money sooner. Because it's taxed at the source, it also means you get it more efficiently and faster. 
<p>

It's like withholding on your paycheck. When you get a paycheck, your employer takes out, or withholds, all of your taxes, all your payroll taxes, and you get the remainder. The rest is siphoned off, sent to the IRS. The same thing is true for investment income, only in this case the business withholds the 17 percent and writes the check to the IRS. Whatever the company decides to give its shareholders, the taxes on that amount already have been paid. It's taxed at the source, taxed once, taxed more efficiently.
<p>

During the campaign, this was made to sound as if it were going to be a giveaway to the rich, a disaster that would destroy the middle class. Actually, it would revive the so-called middle class, which, thankfully, in America is not static; its members are changing all the time.
<p>

The final argument has great resonance within my party, the Republican Party: that a flat tax would hurt the deficit. Again, you have to remember that the flat tax is a means to an end, just as deficit reduction is a means to an end. My own view is that the flat tax is the only way we're ever going to get Washington's finances reformed, because only if you have a vibrant, growing economy, as I said earlier, will you have the political capital to make those difficult changes.
<p>

The deficit would be eliminated, even by the way Washington keeps its books -- which is a disaster -- because you would have great growth. I think we could get 5 percent growth for several years. You would have more compliance. Even with the convoluted tax code today, whenever tax rates are reduced, compliance goes up.
<p>

There would be the efficiency factor: We spend, depending on whose numbers you use, $100 billion to $103 billion a year just complying with the tax code. We spend up to 6 billion hours a year just filling out tax forms. Already, at least in quality of life, our lives would improve. We would have a couple of extra billion hours a year for doing other things. You would have that efficiency factor in the economy as well, with people able to do more productive things -- at least more satisfying things -- than coping with tax forms.
<p>

And finally, with lower interest rates, you would pay less on the national debt. Not only would people have lower mortgage payments, but also there would be less owed on the national debt, which would also take some pressure off the federal deficit.
<p>

So whatever the arguments are -- whether it's housing, charities, munibonds, the middle class, deficits, or something else -- there are good answers to them. It was remarkable during the campaign that, despite the drumbeat of criticism, exit polls showed that in the primaries a plurality or majority of the voters were still in favor of the flat tax. That shows that information can get through some very distorted or polluted filters.
<p>

Let me close by quickly touching on how we got this tax monstrosity and what a unique opportunity we have to fundamentally overhaul the tax code. The background is very simple. Today's government is primarily a result of the wars that we had to fight in this century. Warfare is a centralizing force. In order to face the external threat, a country has to mobilize the resources of its society. And, with very few exceptions, for the last 80 years, America has faced a major external threat of one sort or another.
<p>

When the income tax was introduced in 1913, what was the top rate?  Six percent?  When did you hit the first 1 percent bracket?  I think you had to earn the equivalent of today's six-figure income before you became even eligible for the income tax. Yet five to six years later, because of World War I, what was the top rate?   Over 70 percent. After World War I lawmakers said, "We can't reduce these rates because it would hurt the budget deficit."
<p>

Fortunately, in the 1920s we got Republican Presidents, Harding and Coolidge and a Treasury Secretary, all vilified by the history books, who reduced tax rates to a top rate of 25 percent. But we got a piece of economic warfare: The Smoot-Hawley tariff. It and other policies waged trade and currency war against the rest of the world, and that led to the massive tax increases of 1932.
<p>

No sooner did the New Deal wind down than we had the Second World War, which, of course, was a great centralizing event in this nation's history. And along came tax withholding. And no sooner was World War II over than we found ourselves in a 40-year Cold War.
<p>

By the early 1960s, even though John Kennedy was reducing tax rates, it was accepted economic thinking that you needed high tax rates because if you didn't have them, the government could not spend money, and people might save too much. They really thought saving was a problem in the 1930s, and even in the 1950s: If we saved too much, the economy would stagnate. Without high tax rates, people would keep their money and might not invest it, might not spend it. And the economy would stagnate. In other words, if people won't use their money, the government will take it away and spend it for them.
<p>

That part of things was true: The government has spent it, and then some. By the early 1960s -- and this is important to understand -- a lot of people in America believed that if a government could win two World Wars, alleviate the distress of the Great Depression, put a man on the Moon, and be in the forefront of the civil rights movement, it could be used as an instrument to solve all of the nation's other problems, at home and overseas. 
<p>

 We have learned some very painful lessons in the last 30 years. We have learned the limitations of government in real-life experiences. Now, with the end of the Cold War, we don't have a centralizing trend. We have learned that at home, government is no more successful than it has ever been in creating utopias here on Earth. We do have a situation overseas, at least for a while, of relative peace. I say relative peace: This administration seems to be doing its best to revive bad forces in the world. We still have a window of opportunity, though.
<p>

We are in the midst of a technology age that is pro-individual, machines recentralizing events in and of themselves, big cities, big corporations, big unions, big government. Personal computers are almost Jeffersonian in their characteristics -- anti-hierarchy, anti-authoritarian; they let anyone roam around the world at will. You have the new age of the economy; you have the end of the Cold War. This is a good time to make fundamental reforms and get away from the debris that grew from the travesties, the errors, and the tragedies of the 20th century.
<p>

Why, then, is there so much opposition?  Why did it take this campaign for people to begin discussing making changes in Social Security, to push medical savings accounts?  And why is it that something so basic as the flat tax -- whether it's my version, Dick Armey's version, or somebody else's version, the concept is the same -- why is there so much opposition to it?
<p>

I think the reason is a basic one: A flat tax strikes at the heart of the power and culture of Washington, even as much as term limits does. That's why it will be furiously resisted. But public opinion -- if you nurture it, if you get out there and explain the flat tax, come out with books like Dan's or Dick Armey's books, go on the talk shows, do some little agitprops, as they used to say -- it can triumph.
<p>

And if that kind of tax reform triumphs, then all of our other reforms will be able to triumph as well. We're not talking about devolving power from Washington to the state municipalities; we're taking a more direct route, directly back to "We the people."  Whether it's parental control of education, term limits, a new Social Security system for younger people, medical savings accounts, and especially the flat tax, it's giving power back to us. If you allow people to keep more of the resources they create, they create more resources. It's that simple, as another would-be businessman-politician likes to say. It is that simple.
<p>

So the flat tax is more than an economic argument. It's more than a pressure-on-two-income-families argument. It gets to the essence of the wonderful potential and opportunities we have in America today. And if we take positive advantage of these opportunities, then the basic thrust of American civilization -- which is inclusive, glued together by a shared set of ideas and ideals; not by race, religion, or common ancestry, but by people sharing a set of ideas and ideals -- can triumph and revive, not only here but overseas as well.
<p>

Will this be an age of realized opportunities?  From my experience on the campaign trail -- even though I didn't go as far as I would have liked -- the answer is a resounding "yes."  You here today are proof of it, and as more people understand the possibilities, it is going to happen.
<p>

The history of ideas is never a smooth one, as some of the textbooks would suggest, and it is never one of inevitability. We have to make ideas happen; but in this new age, with the new tools available, and with people ripe for this kind of reform, we can make ideas become reality.
<p>

I hope that we can work together and can get others to work with us to make these reforms happen. When we do, this generation will be seen as doing what previous generations of Americans have done: as having faced opportunities, faced challenges, and risen to the occasion so that future generations can build on what we bequeath them.

<p>
<a href="fyi93.gif">Table 1</a>: How Supermajority States Compare in Gross State Product and Per Capita Tax Revenue
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On April 15th, the House of Representatives will vote on a <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:h.j.res.00159:">Constitutional Amendment</a> requiring a two-thirds supermajority for Congress to raise taxes. In favor of the amendment are those who believe that lawmakers will be more fiscally responsible and the economy will grow faster if it becomes more difficult for Congress to raise taxes. On the other side are those who believe restricting tax increases would interfere with the majority's ability to determine economic policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To be fair, opponents are correct. The proposed amendment would restrict the rights of the majority. But that is precisely the point. Just as the First Amendment is supposed to prohibit the majority from passing laws to infringe upon the rights of free speech and the Second Amendment is supposed to prohibit the majority from passing laws to infringe on the right to keep and bear arms, the supermajority amendment is designed to place limits on the power of the majority to take money from the minority. More specifically, taxpayers are presumed to have a right to their earnings and that only tax increases with very broad support -- as measured by the ability to attract a two-thirds supermajority -- are permissible.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is little doubt that a supermajority will make it harder for politicians to take more money from taxpayers. That is why lawmakers who believe taxes should be higher oppose it. Had a supermajority been in place, some major tax increases from recent years would not have become law. Consider:
<p><ul>
<li> The record tax increase pushed through Congress in 1993 by President Clinton was approved by 51-50 in the Senate and 218-216 in the House. Since a single vote-switch in either body would have killed the legislation, a supermajority requirement easily would have saved the economy from the largest tax increase in American history.
<p>
<li> The large tax increase signed into law in 1990 by President Bush was approved by 54-45 in the Senate and 228-200 in the House. Had a supermajority been required, this ill-fated measure would have fallen 12 votes short in the Senate and 58 votes shy in the House.
<p>
<li> Other major tax increases in recent years, including the tax hikes of 1982, 1984, and 1987, also would have been blocked by a supermajority provision.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Needless to say, these tax increases might never even have come up for a vote had supermajority approval been required. Or at the very least, supporters of the tax increases would have had to reduce the size of the hikes and probably make much-needed reforms to spending programs to attract the needed votes. This helps explain why the lawmakers who oppose this in Congress are those who traditionally favor raising taxes -- they fear the supermajority would restrict them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A supermajority requirement would not, of course, block all tax increases. The 1983 Social Security bailout legislation, for instance, imposed a huge tax increase on workers and allowed incumbents at the time to avoid taking needed steps to fix a fundamentally broken system. That legislation did receive more than two-thirds support in both chambers of Congress. Likewise, it is clear that Congress would be able to increase spending, whether financed by taxes or debt, if there was a genuine national emergency. A supermajority requirement during World War II, for instance, would not have impeded the conduct of fiscal policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nonetheless, some critics say that such a requirement would be disruptive, or even disastrous, if it were imposed on Congress. But seven states worked under such a limit for at least 15 years and there is no indication that it has caused any problem. Significantly, not a single state has repealed the provision. Moreover, the seven states which have lived for quite some time under some form of supermajority -- Arkansas, California, Delaware, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Dakota -- have been joined recently by Arizona, Oklahoma, and Colorado. Nevada and Ohio may soon join the list.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ultimately, the debate over the supermajority boils down to a fight about the size of government and the effect of taxes on economic performance. Proponents of smaller government want to use the balanced budget amendment and the supermajority together to slowly shrink the size and power of the federal government. Further, they want to put a brake on higher taxes, which undermine the goals of fiscal responsibility and economic performance. For instance:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Higher taxes typically are followed by bigger deficits.</b> Tax increases in 1982, 1983, 1984, 1987, 1990, and 1993 have not balanced the budget. Indeed, current CBO projections show the deficit climbing to more than $300 billion within ten years if current policies are left in place.
<p>
<li><b>Higher taxes are associated with higher spending.</b> A 1991 study by the Joint Economic Committee showed that every dollar of higher taxes is associated with more than $1.59 of new spending.<sup>1</sup>  Tax increases are virtually guaranteed to trigger new spending if there is a balanced budget requirement since any new revenues simply allow politicians to satisfy the balanced budget requirement at a higher level of spending.
<P>
<li><b> Higher taxes hurt the economy.</b> Lower taxes in the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s helped trigger economic booms. Higher taxes in the 1930s, 1970s, and 1990s, by contrast, are associated with very mediocre economic performances. The evidence linking taxes and economic performance is powerful. Numerous studies show that nations with low taxes grow faster than countries with high taxes and also that countries can improve their performance by reducing taxes on productive economic behavior.<sup>2</sup>  Similar studies show taxes have the same effect in and among states.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
<li><b> Higher taxes do not collect the promised revenues.</b> Fewer jobs means fewer taxpayers. Lower profits means lower tax collections. Falling incomes mean falling tax revenues. Understanding these simple relationships helps explain why individual income tax revenues have fallen as a percent of GDP since Ronald Reagan left office even though Americans have suffered through two major tax increases.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A supermajority rule is a necessary component of any strategy to shrink the size and power of the federal government, and to limit the power of Congress to tax. High taxes hurt the economy. Not only are five supermajority states below the national average in growth of taxes, but also five are above the national average in overall economic growth (see <a href="fyi93.gif">Table 1</a>). This may be why more and more states have adopted the rule. There is every reason to believe it would have a positive effect on fiscal policy in Washington. Requiring supermajority votes to raise taxes ensures that politicians cannot continue to spend other people's money and evade fiscal responsibility by imposing a higher tax bill on the nation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A wide range of economic studies demonstrates that states will be better off if they keep their tax burdens low. Curbing taxes limits the growth of government and boosts economic performance. By making it harder to raise taxes, supermajority rule would have a desirable effect on the nation's fiscal policy and overall economic performance. To be sure, a supermajority does not guarantee sound economic policy. The record tax increase approved in California several years ago, for instance, happened in spite of a two-thirds supermajority requirement. And many states without supermajorities, such as Tennessee and Nevada, have scored well in most categories of economic performance (this may be due to these states not having an income tax). When all factors are examined, however, there is no escaping the logical relationship between supermajorities and superior state performance. America would be well served if this lesson were applied to the federal budget.

<a href="fyi90t2.gif">Table 2</a>: How Armey-Shelby Flat Tax Affects Households if Withheld Corporate Taxes on Dividends and Interest Payments Are Included with Labor and Small Business Taxes<br>
<a href="fyi90c1.gif">Chart 1</a>: Average Tax Rates Rise With Income under Armey-Shelby Flat Tax 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The presidential campaign has focused national attention on the flat tax. Some candidates in the Republican primary favor the flat tax, and even President Clinton, who currently does not support a single-rate tax system, advocates a fairer, simpler system.<sup>1</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This growing support for the flat tax and fundamental tax reform has enlivened critics who claim that a flat tax system will raise taxes on the middle class. To explore this argument, The Heritage Foundation analyzed the <a href="gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/7waissrc%3A/USHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th?bill=(H ADJ R ADJ 2060)">flat tax proposal</a> put forward by Representative Richard Armey (R-TX) and Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL), which includes a 17 percent tax, the same rate as proposed by Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes.<sup>2</sup> The analysis used the Internal Revenue Service Public Use File for 1991, the most detailed and complete publicly available database of individual income tax returns.<sup>3</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This analysis of the Armey-Shelby plan shows no increase in the taxes paid by the vast majority of middle-class Americans when compared with their current tax burden. In fact, on average, a 17 percent flat tax would lower taxes on all income groups (see <a href="fyi90t1.gif">Table 1</a><sup>4</sup>). Among the key findings:<P>

<b>Question:</b> Does a 17 percent flat tax raise taxes on the middle class?  
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> No. The majority of taxpayers in every income bracket enjoys a tax cut under an Armey-Shelby flat tax with a 17 percent rate.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> If a married couple gross $60,000 in wages, how much will they save in taxes under a 17 percent flat tax?  
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> If they also have two children, they will save $2,488 in taxes. That is a 35 percent lower tax bill.<sup>6</sup>
<P>
<b>Question:</b> Does everyone pay the same flat tax rate, even the very rich?  
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> Yes and no. Everyone faces the same 17 percent rate. However, the flat tax taxes only the difference of total income minus the generous family deduction ($33,300 for a family of four). Because the 17 percent tax is levied on the difference, families with incomes of $50,000 to $75,000 pay only 10 percent of their income, while families with incomes between $200,000 and $500,000 pay 16 percent of their income in taxes.
<P>
<b>Question:</b> If everyone gets a tax cut with a 17 percent flat tax, won't that mean lower tax revenues and higher deficits?  
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> While nearly all individuals pay less tax, many medium- and large-size businesses will pay more. Also, many prominent economists believe that a flat tax will produce a bigger economy, which should result in more federal tax revenues.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Since the Armey-Shelby flat tax proposal eliminates the Earned Income Tax Credit, what happens to low-income taxpayers?  
<P>
<b>Answer:</b> The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) allows low-income taxpayers to claim a credit that generally eliminates their income tax liability and restores some of the income taxed away by the Social Security tax (clearly the largest tax most low-income families pay). The Armey-Shelby bill replaces the EITC with a family deduction that more than doubles current family deductions. While details are unclear, the proposal intends to continue other aspects of the EITC under the government's welfare programs. About 24 million families who pay federal income taxes now will pay no income taxes under the fully implemented Armey-Shelby flat tax.
<p>

<b>What Is a Flat Tax?</b><sup>8</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A flat tax would repeal the current income tax code and replace it with a system based on the following principles:
<p>
1. Tax all income with no deductions except a generous allowance based on family size. Today's complex system could be replaced by two simple, postcard-size forms, one for business and one for individuals.
<p>
2. Tax all income at one rate, applying the law equally to all taxpayers. Everyone faces the same 17 percent rate, and the government would not punish or subsidize taxpayers on the basis of how they earn or spend income.
<p>
3. Tax all income just once, ending the bias against savings and investment. Capital income would be taxed on the business form to ensure compliance, and labor income would be taxed on the individual form.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Armey-Shelby flat tax proposal follows each of these principles. For individuals, only the income from wages, salaries, and pensions is taxed. Individual taxpayers add up income from these sources and then deduct generous personal and dependent exemptions. What is left after these deductions is taxed at 17 percent (after a two-year phase-in period). For businesses, taxes are paid on income from the sale of goods or services. The business first adds up all of its income and then subtracts what it paid out in wages and salaries, what it purchased in order to make its products or provide its services, and the cost of all buildings, land, and other "capital structures" purchased during the tax year. The income that is left after these subtractions is taxed at 17 percent.

<P>
<b>Distribution of Tax Payments</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a href="fyi90t1.gif">Table 1</a> shows the dollar and percentage reduction in average household tax payments under a 17 percent flat tax.<sup>8</sup> These estimates combine so-called labor income (wages and salaries) with all of the small business income currently reported on IRS Form 1040, Schedules C, E, and F.<sup>9</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The most striking feature of this flat tax distribution table is how much taxes are reduced for very low and very high incomes. At the low end, millions of households see their tax payments disappear as a result of the generous family deduction. Specifically:
About 24 million families who pay federal income taxes now will pay no federal income taxes under the fully implemented Armey-Shelby flat tax.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nearly everyone else below $30,000 will see their taxes fall.<sup>10</sup>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Taxpayers at the high end of the income scale also see a substantial reduction in income taxes. These tax cuts result from two factors: the lower tax rate (a drop from an average effective rate of 33 percent to about 17 percent) and an end to the practice of double or triple taxation of so-called passive income (dividends, interest, and capital gains). Dividends and interest actually are payments made by companies to stockholders and depositors out of company income that already has been taxed. Furthermore, individuals buy company stock and make time deposits in savings accounts with after-tax income. Thus, all of the cash transactions associated with, say, a dividend are based on income that already has been taxed. To collect additional tax on dividends, interest, and capital gains constitutes double taxation, thus violating the principle of taxing all income only once and at its source. This double taxation would be ended under the Armey-Shelby flat tax.
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Taxing income only once at its source results in a tax cut at the upper end of the income scale, just as it results in a tax cut for lower- and middle-income households with income from interest, capital gains, and dividends. While nearly 34 percent of all dividends claimed as income goes to households with total incomes below $50,000 (largely households with retired taxpayers), the average dividend income reported by upper-income households is much greater: $37,695 for incomes of $200,000 and above as opposed to $2,050 for incomes of $50,000 or below.<sup>11</sup> Thus, the exclusion of this income from taxes paid by individuals has a greater effect on taxes paid by wealthy people than on taxes paid by people of more limited means.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Because businesses under Armey-Shelby would pay taxes on the income from which they make dividend and interest payments, it is correct to say that the taxes on these payments are withheld at the business level in much the same way that income taxes on wages and salaries currently are withheld at the business level. <a href="fyi90t2.gif">Table 2</a> shows the effects of this withholding on the tax liabilities of households.<sup>12</sup> The dividend and interest payments received by households in <a href="fyi90t2.gif">Table 2</a> have been taxed at the business level, and these taxes are added to the 17 percent Armey-Shelby taxes of <a href="fyi90t1.gif">Table 1</a>. A quick comparison of Tables 1 and 2 shows who shoulders the burden of dividend and interest taxes. As income rises, the implicit burden of taxes on these forms of income also increases.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is worth noting in this regard that corporate income taxes increase under an Armey-Shelby flat tax. This increase largely offsets decreases in individual tax payments during the tax's two-year implementation period; Heritage's tax models currently estimate that taxes from individuals will fall by $51 billion, while taxes from corporations will rise by $52 billion.
<P>

<b>Progressive Nature of the Flat Tax</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While it is certainly true that the flat tax as proposed by Representative Armey and Senator Shelby taxes income at one rate, the taxpayer and dependent exemption causes the actual rates paid by taxpayers to increase as incomes rise. For example, a single taxpayer without children and making $25,000 would be exempt from income tax on the first $11,350 and would pay a 17 percent tax on the remaining $13,650. The tax would be $2,321, or 9.3 percent of $25,000. If part of the $25,000 was dividend income, of course, tax already would have been taken out at the corporate level. A single taxpayer making $250,000 would pay a 17 percent tax on $238,650 under the Armey-Shelby bill. The tax would be $40,571, or 16.2 percent of total income. It is the presence of the exemption that makes the flat tax "progressive."<sup>13</sup>
<p>
<b>Technical Note</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The data shown in Tables <a href="fyi90t1.gif">1</a> and <a href="fyi90t2.gif">2</a> and <a href="fyi90c1.gif">Chart 1</a> are based on income tax records contained in the IRS Public Use File for 1991, a statistically accurate sample of all individual income tax returns for that year. The file contains 115,000 taxpaying households and 178 tax variables per household. When a variable is multiplied by its weight, the value of the variable equals its national total. Thus, the value of wage and salary income for a family earning $35,000 equals the national total for families in that income class when it is multiplied by its national weight. These are the same data the IRS's own Statistics of Income Division uses when preparing its annual analysis of taxpayers. They are the most accurate and complete tax data available for public use.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The tax payments shown in Tables 1 and 2 include all of the kinds of taxable income that individuals now report on their annual 1040 tax form. Individuals currently report labor income (for example, wages and salaries) as well as business income from self-employment, trusts, partnerships, farming operations, and other business activities. However, the more prominent flat tax proposals make an important change in the way small business income is reported. Proposals similar to the Armey-Shelby bill separate labor income from business income and allow businesses to deduct from their gross income the costs of operations, the value of land and capital structures purchased during the year, and the wages and salaries paid to their employees.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This separation of labor income from business income makes comparing the current tax system with a flat tax system difficult. In order to compare current taxes fairly with those collected under a flat tax, we added together the flat taxes individuals would pay on their labor income and on their small business income. This combination is reported in the flat tax columns of Tables 1 and 2. Thus, both sets of numbers include taxes paid on labor and business income.
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, with respect to the effect higher business taxes might have on low- and middle-income families, many tax analysts believe that higher business taxes mean higher prices for consumers. Low- and middle-income households have more difficulty paying higher prices than do wealthier households. Thus, these analysts argue that increases in business taxes that produce higher consumer prices really amount to regressive "tax" increases on those families least able to pay for them.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While there maybe some truth to this view, the measurement of the relationship between tax changes and price changes is very difficult. First, the flat tax is expected to reduce many of the costs business faces, most particularly the cost of capital. Thus, firms may decide not to pass along tax increases to consumers. Second, more than half of all businesses will see a tax decrease under the Armey-Shelby bill, which could result in lower consumer prices. Third, history shows that firms in competitive markets are less likely to charge consumers for tax increases than firms in regulated, uncompetitive markets. The Heritage Foundation will address this issue in a future paper.

<li>    While the tax reform proposal offered by Mr. Forbes uses the same tax rate as the fully implemented Armey-Shelby plan, the proposals are not identical. The Forbes plan, for instance, has a larger personal allowance.<P>
<li>    For a detailed description of our analysis, see the Technical Note at the end of this paper.<p>
<li>   Tables <a href="fyi90t1.gif">1</a> and <a href="fyi90t2.gif">2</a> do not show the effect of any special rules to ease the transition from the current tax system to the Armey-Shelby flat tax. Thus, these tables probably overstate the amount of additional taxes some businesses would pay under a flat tax. For example, current tax policy requires businesses to depreciate their equipment purchases over a fixed period of time, often 15 years. Thus, many businesses have a large amount of unused depreciation that they have been carrying on their books as an asset. However, the Armey-Shelby flat tax does away with tax depreciation for capital equipment and replaces this policy with one that permits businesses to expense their purchases of land, structures, and equipment in the year that these items are purchased. To move from the current system to the Armey-Shelby flat tax means either writing off billions of dollars in accumulated depreciation or enacting a "transition rule" that would allow businesses to use accumulated depreciation for a few years as a deduction from gross sales. The Heritage Foundation is engaged in developing and analyzing such rules and will provide commentary on transition issues at a future date.<p>
<li>    Economists and sociologists for decades have been trying to reach agreement about what constitutes the middle class. We certainly will not attempt to enter that debate in this paper. However, broadly defining the middle class as single- and multi-person households with incomes between $30,000 and $100,000 probably includes what most analysts view as middle-class.<p>
<li>   For estimates of how much average tax bills are reduced by a 17 percent flat tax in each state, see William W. Beach and Daniel J. Mitchell, "The Flat Tax Cuts Individual Income Taxes in Every State," Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi86.html"><I>F.Y.I.</I> No. 86</a>, February 7, 1996.<p>
<li>    Economists are beginning to publish analyses of how a flat tax would effect economic activity. One of the most important essays to appear so far is by Alan J. Auerbach of the University of California, Berkeley, and the National Bureau of Economic Research. See Auerbach, "Tax Reform, Capital Allocation, Efficiency and Growth," paper presented at Brookings Conference on Fundamental Tax Reform, February 15-16, 1996.<p>
<li>   The Heritage Foundation has published a number of other papers on tax reform and on the flat tax specifically. See Daniel J. Mitchell, "Jobs, Growth, Freedom, and Fairness: Why America Needs a Flat Tax," Heritage Foundation <I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1035, May 25, 1995, and Daniel J. Mitchell, "Which Tax Reform Plan Is Best for America?," Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1055.html"><I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1055</a>, September 26, 1995.<p>
<li>    The Heritage Foundation used the largest publicly available tax database to construct these estimates. The Internal Revenue Service Public Use File for 1991 is a statistically significant sample of all of the individual income tax returns filed in 1991. Estimates of current average tax payments were calculated by applying the 1996 tax rates and bracket amounts to net taxable income. The estimates of flat tax liabilities were calculated using the provisions of the tax reform proposal advanced by the Majority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, Representative Richard Armey (R-TX), and Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL). See <a
href="gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/7waissrc%3A/USHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th?bill=(H ADJ R ADJ 2060)">H.R. 2060</a> and S. 1050.<p>
<li>    See Technical Note.<p>
<li>   For example, the family deduction for a single taxpayer is $11,350; for a married family of four, it is $33,300; and for a head of household with two children, it is $25,450. Only incomes greater than these amounts are taxable under the Armey-Shelby flat tax.<p>
<li>    See Internal Revenue Service, <I>Individual Income Tax Returns 1991</I>, Publication 1304 (Rev. 3/94), p. 28, Table 1.4, cols. 9 and 10.<p>
<li>    It is possible also to view taxes on capital gains as "withheld" taxes: The net present value of corporations is connected intimately to their ability to remain profitable while paying all of their taxes. However, households rather than businesses control the timing of capital gains realizations, which makes the analyst's job of estimating the business tax liabilities for capital gains exceptionally difficult. Thus, taxes on capital gains are not shown in Table 2. If they could be shown, the total tax liabilities of high-income households under a fully phased 17 percent flat tax would be even greater.<p>
<li>    Some advocates of the flat tax say that a taxpayer with 10 times the income pays 10 times more tax. Actually, the flat tax requires wealthier taxpayers to pay somewhat more than that, since the taxpayer and dependent deductions remain the same regardless of income level. In the above example, the richer taxpayer, who has 10 times more income, pays 17.2 times more tax than the poorer taxpayer.

<title>A Republican Agenda to Reverse the Clinton Crunch - Heritage</title>

<h3>A REPUBLICAN AGENDA TO REVERSE THE CLINTON CRUNCH</h3>

<b>By <a href="http://www.house.gov/armey/welcome.html">Dick Armey</a></b>
<P>Dick Armey is Majority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives and represents the 26th district of Texas.  He spoke at <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>, on February 27, 1996.

<P>
Can you believe that, in his State of the Union speech, President Clinton actually said "our economy is the healthiest it has been in three decades"? I have to say, President Clinton is the Herald of Happy Talk, but this is what my wife Susan calls denial.
<table border=0 align=left>
<tr><td><img src="flnrarmy.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><th>Majority Leader Armey and Heritage<br> President Edwin Feulner</th></tr></table><p>
Only last week Alan Greenspan called the current economy "dismal." The Administration admitted as much when it announced that the economy grew less than 1 percent annually last quarter. This White House is quickly bringing back Jimmy Carter's economic malaise, but now they're calling it a funk.
<p>
The last two years of the Carter presidency were the worst for family incomes since the Great Depression. Ronald Reagan brought families back to prosperity with tax cuts, deregulation, good humor, and optimism. But Bill Clinton is bringing us a return of the middle-class squeeze.
<p>
Millions of working American families gather around their kitchen tables at the end of a hard work week and wonder why it is they can't seem to make ends meet. They work longer and longer hours, they take second jobs, but they feel they are just running in place. They are losing their faith in the American Dream: that their sons and daughters will achieve a higher living standard than their parents and grandparents.
<P>


I lay the blame for America's anxiety at the feet of this Administration. Here's the evidence:
<ol><p>
<li> In each and every year of the Clinton presidency, the typical American family had less real income than when President Clinton took office. Last year alone, the typical family earned $790 less than in 1992.
<P>
<li> The President enacted the largest tax increase in history, and the result is that the typical family now devotes 24.5 percent of its income to federal taxes -- a greater share of income than at any time in America's peacetime history.
</ol><p>

<b>Higher Taxes, Lower Incomes</b>
<p>
These two factors combine to make up the Clinton Crunch: taxes going up and incomes going down. If, instead, families had continued to prosper as they did during the Reagan expansion, the average family would have had $1,274 more last year.
<p>
Republicans want to reverse the Clinton Crunch. We want incomes to go up while taxes go down. Republicans want you to earn more and keep more of what you earn.
<p>
But this Administration would rather feel your pain than deal with it. Secretary Reich, for example, recites the Democrat mantra that real wages for the median worker have fallen 4.6 percent since 1979. He's just reciting the time-worn Democrat party line.
<p>
Income certainly hasn't fallen steadily since 1979. As President Carter completed his term, the nation plunged into recession and wages plummeted. But wages and incomes rebounded during the Reagan expansion years. Tragically, just as families had nearly regained their pre-Carter standard of living, the Democrat Congress and the Bush Administration stalled their forward progress, and now the Clinton Crunch has knocked families backwards.
<p>
What's the lesson here? The only period of sustained wage growth in the last 17 years came as government was cutting taxes and paring back red tape.
<p>
President Clinton didn't just ignore the lessons of history; he defied them. He enacted the largest tax increase in the nation's history and piled on new regulations. It's no wonder that more than half of the wage decline since 1979 occurred under Clinton's watch.
<p>
This Administration and the Democrats think the answer is more government, higher taxes, and more regulation. The President even wants to add new obstacles like a minimum wage hike -- putting the bottom rung of the economic ladder of success out of reach for millions of unskilled workers. The President says he wants to decrease the number of working poor. The trouble is he would do it by making the working poor the non-working poor.
<p>
<b>Bill Clinton: Last Defender of the Welfare State</b>
<p>
In a classic Clinton disconnect, Bill Clinton said that the "era of big government is over," but his actions make it clear that he is the last defender of the welfare state. He stands alone against the tide of reform and renewal rising throughout America.
<p>
More jobs were created in the last six months of the Bush Administration than in these past six months of the Clinton Administration. Bill Clinton inherited a growing economy and quickly trampled prosperity. But that's not all.
<p><ul>
<li>He vetoed the first balanced budget in 26 years.
<li> He vetoed tax cuts for working America and for economic growth.
<li> He vetoed regulatory relief that would have eliminated excess red tape that stifles wages. 
<li>He vetoed legal reform that would have stopped expensive, frivolous lawsuits. 
<li>He vetoed welfare reform that required work and discouraged illegitimacy.
</ul><p>
 Bill Clinton desperately wants to preserve the status quo. He and too many technocrats in Washington are willing to resign this nation to sluggish growth and limited opportunity. We can't settle for that kind of mediocrity.
<p>
But I'm here to bring you good news. Congressional Republicans have an Agenda to Reverse the Clinton Crunch. We must revive prosperity so that working people can once again earn more and keep more of what they earn.
<p>
I have a favorite saying that makes a serious point about the American Dream and why economic growth is the most important goal of Republican policy. Very simply put, every parent knows, deep down, that the American Dream isn't just owning your own home; it's getting your kids out of it.
<p>
Think about it. We struggle through parenthood, sharing our children's hopes and joys and getting them through their disappointments. We're rewarded for all our hard work on that magic day when they burst through the door and say, "Mom, Dad, I got the job." It takes economic growth to create those jobs for our kids so they can start their lives, get married, and finally give us old folks the grandkids we so desperately want to spoil.
<p>
<b>Reversing the Clinton Crunch</b><p>
This is the American Dream, imperiled by the Clinton Crunch. House Republicans have a 9-point <b>Agenda to Reverse the Clinton Crunch</b>:
<p><ol>
<li> Cutting taxes on investment to create jobs; 
<li> Tax relief for working farnilies with children; 
<li> Protecting pensions for working Americans; 
<li> Streamlining regulations that stifle wages and increase prices; 
<li> Reforming the health insurance market to eliminate job lock; 
<li> Putting power in the hands of workers, not bureaucrats, by consolidating worker training programs;
 <li>Enforcing the <i>Beck</I> decision to end the coercive hidden tax that forces union workers to support partisan politics; 
<li> Voting on a tax limitation constitutional amendment to let you keep more of what you earn; and
<li>Continuing our success in eliminating wasteful government spending to use tax dollars wisely and move power back to the states.
</ol><p>
<b>Step 1: The first major step in restoring growth and easing the Clinton Crunch is tax relief.</b> We must cut taxes on investment to get the economy moving again. <b>This year, I am confident we can and will develop a capital gains tax cut that this President can sign</b>. We need capital gains  tax relief so that investment can flow from the stagnant industries of yesterday to the start-up firms of tomorrow, so that a person with a great idea today becomes an employer tomorrow.

<p>
<b>Step 2:</b> We will continue to pursue a child tax credit. When Democrats started their 40-year run as the majority in Congress, the average family paid $1 to the federal government for every $50 they earned. Today, the average family pays $12 to the federal government for every $50 earned. It's time to turn that trend around.
<p>
To  appreciate fully how big the federal tax bite is, I propose that you take the Armey Challenge. Look at your paystub every month, for as many months as it takes, and see if you are paying more for taxes than for food, clothing, and shelter combined. Too many of you will find that government-costs you more than the necessities of life. And that is wrong! <b>We will, again this year, give the President an opportunity to fulfill his campaign promise of a middle-class tax cut.</b>
<p>
<b>Step 3:</b> One of the largest sources of investment funds today is the pension and retirement savings millions of Americans set aside each year. Pension managers, wanting to get their investors the highest return, seek out the best investments. It's a win for savers, who earn a higher return; for borrowers, who can start or expand their businesses; and for workers, when new jobs are created. But Secretary Reich wants to pre-empt that synergy. He wants the government to choose "winners" and "losers" by redirecting pension funds into "social investment.'' That means lower returns for future retirees, and less investment funds available to start real, productive businesses that create jobs and opportunities. <b>The House passed Jim Saxton's H.R. 1594 last vear to stop Reich's pension grab. I'll ask Senator Dole to move this bill through the Senate so we can send it to the President this year.</b>
<P>
<b>Step 4:</b> Outdated regulations force employers to spend money investing in Washington paperwork instead of productive equipment -- and paying lawyers instead of giving raises to workers. We'll restore wage growth by eliminating unnecessary and job-destroying government regulation. Cutting excess red tape creates more jobs and higher wages, and lowers prices for consumers. <b>In March. the House will pass a regulatory reform bill H.R. 994, designed by Representatives Bill Clinger and Henry Hyde, updating the Regulatory Flexibility Act and requiring Administration review of old regulations</b>. We expect the legislation to be on the President's desk this spring.
<p>
<b>Step 5: In April, the House will vote to end health insurance job lock</b>. Today, too many working parents are afraid to pursue new opportunities, start a new career, or become an entrepreneur because they don't want to lose the health insurance they now have. This year we will bring up legislation centered around Representative Bill Thomas's H.R. 1610 to increase the availability, affordability, and accountability of health care coverage for working families.
<p>
<b>Step 6:</b> Federal job training programs today train workers for jobs that no longer exist. They erect barriers rather than bridges between aspiring workers and the jobs they seek. <b>The House and Senate this year will complete work on Representative Bill Goodling's CAREERS bill (H.R. 1617)</b>, which takes control away from bureaucrats, who are in no position to know where the jobs are, and puts it in the hands of workers searching for training.
<p>
<b>Step 7:</b> The Supreme Court's 1988 <I>Beck</I> decision, which declared that union members cannot be forced to pay dues to pay for anything other than collective bargaining costs, today remains unenforced. As a result, union households are forced to pay dues to support partisan advocacy that violates their core political beliefs. In the <I>Beck</I> case, 79 percent of union dues funded activities other than collective bargaining, including overt partisan political activity. As Thomas Jefferson said, "To compel a man to furnish funds for the propagation of ideas he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical." <b>This year, the House will bring legislation to the floor to end this hidden tax</b>. We must give union families control over how their hard-earned income is spent and restore their right to advocate their own political beliefs.
<p>
<b>Step 8:  On April 15, the House will vote on a constitutional amendment to limit tax increases</b>. The tax limitation amendment puts an end to the cycle of the past 40 years -- special interests in Washington demanding more spending, and Congress raising taxes to pay for it.
<p>
The American people know that cutting spending is the only way to get our fiscal house in order and balance the budget. Economists from all parts of the political spectrum agree that balancing the budget would bring interest rates down by nearly 25 percent -- or 2 percentage points. That means entrepreneurs and small businesspeople can better afford to start and expand firms, hire more workers, and invest in new equipment to boost productivity and wages. And a 2 percentage point reduction in interest rates translates into $1,300 per year in interest savings for a typical family with a home mortgage, a car loan, and student loans.
<p>
<b>Step 9:</b> Finally, we will continue this year to cut wasteful government spending. Two economists I hold in very high regard, Lowell Galloway and Richard Vedder of Ohio University, have done extensive work on the optimal size of government. Their research confirmed what I like to call the Armey Curve. It showed that government spending, up to about 18 percent of the economy, can have a positive impact. But beyond that point, Keynes is wrong -- more government isn't a stimulus; it's an obstacle to growth.
<p>
Today, federal spending approaches 22 percent of the economy. Clearly, there's ample
room to cut. In fact, Vedder and Galloway estimate that each dollar of federal spending restraint
increases private sector spending by $1.38. <b>In plain English, cutting wasteful government
stimulates growth and creates jobs</b>. Since Republicans became the majority in Congress, we put
government on track to cut federal spending by $50 billion this year and last. But that's only a
beginning. This year, we will again cut spending and return power to the states to give the
taxpayers more bang for their buck.
<p>
<b>A New Vitality for America</b>
<p>
This Republican Agenda to Reverse the Clinton Crunch will create a new vitality in our nation. Every family once again will have the opportunity and the freedom to pursue the American Dream so that our sons and daughters can always achieve a higher standard of living than their parents and grandparents. A rising tide of prosperity will lift the fortunes of all Americans --  unless President Clinton keeps us tied to the moorings of big government, as he did last year.
<p>
America faces a momentous choice this year as we decide which of two paths this nation will follow into the next century. Republicans believe we must pursue freedom so that families can earn more and keep more of what they earn. We must put our faith in the ingenuity and goodness of the American people, rather than the guile of the government, to get this country back on track. Ronald Reagan's return to freedom ushered in an era of historic prosperity in this nation. The President would take us down the other path -- the path of the stifling, big-government status quo.
<P>
It is outrageous for an Administration that stifled job creation by hiking taxes to lament joblessness. It is outrageous for those whose red tape choked off raises for working men and women to decry falling wages. The President and other liberals in Washington have the gall to blame Americans for the Clinton Crunch. <b>And it is wrong</b>.
<p>
The "blame Americans" strategy will not work. False promises won't alleviate anxiety about what the future holds. Public hand-wringing will not rekindle our national optimism. Angry words will not create jobs. And class warfare demagoguery will not relieve the Clinton Crunch. 
<p>
America's anxiety will ease only as individual families witness and experience success. Republicans have an agenda to rekindle that success, while the President has only empty rhetoric. It's not enough to say "I feel your pain" when you're the one causing it. The President must accept responsibility for his actions.
<p>
Congressional Republicans have an Agenda to Reverse the Clinton Crunch by relieving the burden of taxes and big government.  Our program will restore faith in the American Dream as families, one by one, prosper through freedom.

<p><hr width=50%></center>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	American taxpayers, disgusted with today's flawed 
tax system, increasingly support efforts to scrap it for something entirely new. With the exception 
of the White House, there is almost universal agreement that America's tax system is anti-growth 
and anti-family. And to add insult to injury, tax laws are mind-numbingly complex, simultaneously 
punishing average taxpayers while creating special preferences for those with the right lawyers, 
accountants, and lobbyists.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		But what should replace the current system?  
Should America have a flat tax?  If so, which flat tax?  Or is the answer a sales tax or value-added 
tax?  Should a new tax system punish success by imposing higher tax rates as income rises?  With 
so many different tax reform plans being proposed, taxpayers understandably need some objective 
way of measuring which plan will generate the most benefits. The following table, based on nine 
criteria, gives an overall grade to each of the major tax reform plans.<sup>1 </sup>
<P><center>
<table border=0>
<caption><b>TAXPAYERS AND THE ECONOMY</b><br>
Grading Tax Reform Proposals</caption>

<tr>
<th>Armey/Shelby flat tax</th><td>A</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>National sales tax</th><td>B</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>Forbes flat tax</th><td>A</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>Buchanan flat tax</th><td>B-</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>Specter flat tax</th><td>A-</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>Gramm flat tax</th><td>B</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>Value-added tax</th><td>B+</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>Gephardt tax reform plan</th><td>C</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>Nunn-Domenici USA tax</th><td>C+</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>Kemp Commission</th><td>Not a specific plan, but the commission report outlines the 
features of a pro-growth tax system and probably would be ranked in the top tier.</td>
</tr></table>
</center><p>
<b>The Nine Criteria:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>One Low Rate -- because work, saving, and investment should be rewarded, not punished;
<p>
<li>Simplicity --  because the pain of paying taxes should not be compounded by complexity;
<p>
<li>Savings and Investment --  because the tax code should not penalize these activities needed to 
increase growth;
<p>
<li>Social Engineering -- because people, not politicians, should be in charge of how their money 
is spent;
<p>
<li>Intrusiveness/Civil Liberties --  because a tax code granting the government too much power is 
not part of the American ideal;
<p>
<li>Fairness -- because the law should apply equally to all;
<p>
<li>Risk --  because a new tax plan should not contain pitfalls;
<p>
<li>Evasion --  because everyone should pay his fair share;
<p>
<li>International Competitiveness -- because American workers deserve the highest wages and 
living standards.
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On these and other criteria, "pure" flat tax plans score 
the highest. Direct consumption taxes also fare well, with their only significant liability being the 
risk that politicians would use them as an additional source of revenue rather than as a replacement 
for the current system. Modified flat tax plans score higher than the current system, but they do 
maintain significant amounts of double taxation and are not graded as high as pure flat taxes. Tax 
reform proposals which resemble the current system, needless to say, fare poorly.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Since no tax system is perfect, any grading scale is 
somewhat subjective. If a reform, or a particular feature of a plan, moves as close to the ideal as 
possible, it earns a grade of "A."  Proposals or parts of proposals that reflect a significant 
improvement over current law receive "B" grades. A grade of "C" means the tax plan or the 
particular feature of the plan was no better or worse than the tax code is today, while "D" and "F" 
grades reflect substantially worsening and worst case, respectively.
<p>

<b>THE NEW TAX PLANS</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Several major proposals have been introduced since 
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1055.html">"Which Tax Reform Plan is Best 
for America?"</a>  was published by <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a> in 
September 1995. This analysis updates that publication with detailed analysis of the plan put 
forward by the <a href="/taxcom/reptoc.html">National Commission on Economic Growth and 
Tax Reform</a> (the Kemp Commission) as well as plans prepared by Senator Phil Gramm (R-
TX) and presidential candidates Steve Forbes and Pat Buchanan.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The following are the key features of the tax reform 
proposals released in recent months:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Kemp Commission</b> -- The report issued by 
the <a href="/taxcom/reptoc.html">National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax 
Reform</a> cannot be graded on the same scale as the other plans because it is not a legislative 
proposal.<sup> 2</sup>  The report, for instance, does not specify a rate and is largely silent on the 
issue of itemized deductions. Instead, the commission's report outlines the key principles of a sound 
tax system and makes several recommendations as to how any acceptable reform package could be 
structured. Many of the general recommendations -- such as tax all income at one rate, but one 
time, and require a supermajority to increase the rate -- are very desirable and will be judged, to the 
extent possible, against the nine criteria.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Forbes flat tax</b> -- Very similar to the 
Armey/Shelby proposal, the <a href="http://www.forbes96.com/html/is_flat.html">Forbes flat 
tax</a> would replace the current personal and corporate income tax systems with a simple 17 
percent tax on all income. All labor income, with the exception of a generous personal allowance 
($36,000 for a family of four), would be taxed at the individual level. Taxes on business and capital 
income (interest, dividends, profits, capital gains, and rents) would be withheld and paid at the 
business level. Unlike the current system, no income would be subjected to more than one layer of 
tax. Both businesses and individuals would be able to use postcard-size tax returns.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Gramm flat tax</b> --  Senator <a 
href="http://www.gramm96.org/cato11796.shtml">Phil Gramm</a> favors a 16 percent tax rate, 
but his flat tax is substantially different from many of the existing proposals. He keeps deductions 
for home mortgage interest and charitable deductions, but the biggest difference is the continued 
double taxation of many forms of income. Capital gains taxes would not be abolished, while 
income used for savings would continue to be taxed twice and the bias against business investment 
would be reduced, but it would not be eliminated. By making these modifications, and also by 
choosing to tax corporate profits at the individual rather than business level, the Gramm plan would 
not achieve the same level of simplicity as a "pure" flat tax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Buchanan flat tax</b> -- Similar in many ways to 
the Gramm proposal, the <a href="http://www.buchanan.org/reveal.html">Buchanan plan</a> 
contains a low 15 percent rate, but many types of income are double-taxed. Corporate profits would 
continue to be taxed at both the individual and business level. Savings would be taxed twice. There 
would be a flat 17 percent rate on corporations, but provisions biasing the current system against 
investment, such as the alternative minimum tax and depreciation, would remain. On the individual 
side, the plan also continues deductions for such items as home mortgage interest and charitable 
contributions, thus adding considerable complexity when compared to traditional flat tax plans.
<p>


<b>GRADING THE TAX PLANS</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While each reform has an overall grade, it is 
particularly useful to see how the different proposals address specific flaws in the current system. 
The grades in the following section indicate the extent to which different plans reflect nine 
important principles of sound tax policy.
<p>

<b>LOW RATES</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	A low, single rate treats all citizens equally under the 
law and ensures that taxpayers have little incentive to hide, shelter, and underreport income. 
Because willingness to work, save, invest, and take risks is tied to the expected rewards of such 
behavior, the lower the tax rate(s), the higher the level of economic growth.
<p>
Kemp Commission report: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The report does not specify a rate, but makes clear 
that the rate should be as low as possible.
<p>
Forbes flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 		A
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	With a rate of 17 percent, the Forbes plan earns high 
marks.
<P>
Gramm flat tax	: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	B+
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The low 16 percent rate ranks highly, but the double 
taxation of certain income (discussed in the savings and investment section) is a problem.
<P>
Buchanan flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		B+
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Like Gramm's plan, Buchanan's deserves credit for 
one low rate. It also suffers, however, from the same flaw.
<p>
<b>SIMPLICITY</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The current income tax requires hundreds of forms 
and consumes more than 5 billion hours of taxpayer time each year. Business compliance costs are 
particularly large.
<P>
Kemp Commission report: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	N/A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Any plan calling for one rate and taxing income only 
one time will automatically generate substantially greater simplicity. A specific grade, however, is 
difficult without knowing the specific structure of the flat tax and whether deductions would 
remain.
<p>
Forbes flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Like Armey/Shelby, the entire tax code is 
compressed down to postcard size. All taxpayers need to calculate is their total income and family 
size.
<p>
Gramm flat tax	:&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	B
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The plan would have some level of simplification, but 
capital gains, depreciation, itemized deductions, and other provisions limit the scope of benefits. 
Taxing dividends and interest on the individual form will also necessitate continued use of more 
than one billion 1099 forms.
<p>
Buchanan flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		B-
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The business side of the tax code, which generates 
the most compliance costs, remains largely untouched. The Buchanan plan also continues the estate 
tax, thus missing an opportunity to remove a source of considerable complexity.

<p>

<b>SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Having one low rate is a necessary feature of a pro-
growth tax system, but it is not the only piece of the puzzle. Equally important is that the tax code 
be designed so that income is taxed only one time. The current system hinders the growth of 
incomes and living standards by the multiple taxing of savings and investment.
<p>
Kemp Commission report: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The panel makes clear that no income should be 
taxed more than one time. Combined with the low rate, this would generate significantly higher 
levels of capital formation.
<p>
Forbes flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Like other pure flat tax proposals, the Forbes plan 
does not discriminate against income used for savings and investment.
<p>
Gramm flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 			B
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some double taxation is eliminated, but the treatment of 
capital gains, savings, and depreciation will leave continued bias against capital formation.
<p>
Buchanan flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			B-
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Like Gramm, Buchanan errs by not fully addressing 
the bias against savings and investment. In addition to double-taxing capital gains, savings, and 
depreciation, Buchanan retains the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax.

<P>
<b>SOCIAL ENGINEERING</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The tax code today rewards some types of activity, 
everything from putting a child in day care to buying a home. Other behaviors, however, such as 
savings and investment, are penalized harshly. Once a tax system strays from the concept of 
treating all income equally, regardless of how it is earned or how it is spent, the door is open for 
special interests to add special preferences to the tax code on behalf of wealthy clients.
<p>
Kemp Commission report: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		A-
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The report clearly states that the tax system should 
apply neutrally. It does not, however, completely rule out deductions that would shift behavior.
<P>
Forbes flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			A
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Other than a family allowance, there is no preference, 
loophole, or exclusion in the Forbes plan.
<p>
Gramm flat tax	: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		B
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In addition to the bias against savings and 
investment, the Texas Senator's plan retains deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable 
contributions.
<p>
Buchanan flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			B
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Shortcomings are similar to the Gramm proposal.

<p>

<b>INTRUSIVENESS/CIVIL LIBERTIES</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In part because of the Internal Revenue Code's mind-
numbing complexity, but also because of legislative directives, the IRS engages in tax collection 
activities that many believe are abusive. Moreover, complexity invites government intrusion to 
verify many tax returns. A simple tax code, with easily understood rules that apply to everyone, 
would solve much of this problem. Thus, the highest grades are given to proposals that minimize 
the scope of and opportunity for intrusion.
<p>
Kemp Commission report: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		A
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even without details, it is hard to see how a tax 
system based on the commission's report could fail to eliminate the vast majority of problems. 
Indeed, its very first recommendation is to repeal the entire Internal Revenue Code.
<p>
Forbes flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The only possible source of conflict between an 
individual taxpayer and the IRS under a flat tax are total income earned and the size of one's family. 
Whatever other problems remain, such as deductions for the self-employed, would be a fraction of 
those that exist now. Businesses will benefit even more dramatically because of the simplicity.
<P>
Gramm flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			B
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Continued double taxation of some forms of capital 
income preserves opportunities for tax avoidance behavior that would necessitate the attention of 
the tax authorities and the maintenance of a layer of enforcement bureaucracy.
<p>
Buchanan flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			B
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Like the Gramm plan, the Buchanan flat tax is an 
improvement, but many potential conflicts in the tax code will remain.

<P>
<b>FAIRNESS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fairness in the tax system should mean equal 
treatment. Any special provision, whether to punish or reward, violates the principle that the law 
should apply equally.
<p>
Kemp Commission report: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The recommendations and tone of the commission's 
report clearly indicate strong support for treating all taxpayers and all income equally. Declares the 
report: "[I]f one taxpayer earns ten times as much as his neighbor, he should pay ten times as much 
in taxes."<sup>3 </sup>
<p>
Forbes flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	All taxpayers pay the same rate, and all income is 
taxed one time.
<p>
Gramm flat tax	: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		B
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The single rate is a dramatic improvement over 
today's code, but the double taxation of savings and investment and itemized deductions undermine 
the goal of equality.
<p>
Buchanan flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 			B
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Better than current law, but suffers from the same 
problems as the Gramm flat tax.

<p>

<b>DOWNSIDE RISK</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While many tax reform proposals are conceptually 
attractive and would help the economy if enacted, they should not be examined in a vacuum. The 
political process causes any plan to evolve over time, generally in an undesirable direction. Thus, 
the probability of a plan that will retain its beneficial design features should be considered.
<P>
Kemp Commission report: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		N/A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As long as no itemized deductions are allowed, a tax 
plan based on the commission's report should be stable and long-lasting. Without clear guidance on 
the use of deductions, however, it is difficult to assign a grade. The supermajority requirement to 
raise taxes, if enacted, would help considerably.
<p>
Forbes flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			B
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The single rate and purity of the Forbes plan, 
combined with support for a supermajority, provide a significant margin of safety. As with any 
proposal, it is difficult to bind the hands of future politicians completely.
<p>
Gramm flat tax	: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		C+
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One rate is a big improvement, but with double 
taxation and deductions retained, political pressure to include further distortions would soon 
develop. The influence of lobbyists might be curtailed, but not by much.
<p>
Buchanan flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 			C+
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Once again, the plan mirrors both the good and the bad 
features of the Gramm proposal. Government would have the ability to discriminate on the basis of 
how income is earned and how it is spent.
<P>

<b>EVASION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To maintain public support, a tax system must ensure 
that everyone plays by the same rules. If the public views the law as corrupt or unenforcable, there 
will be pressure to return to the old system. This means that the new tax must not create 
opportunities or incentives for taxpayers either legally or illegally to shift behavior just to avoid 
taxes.
<P>
Kemp Commission report: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			A-
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Assuming a tax system faithfully follows the report's 
recommendations, it is hard to see how a new tax system could offer many chances to evade taxes. 
It is not clear, however, whether capital income would be collected at the source.
<p>
Forbes flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;				A
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Because of the single low rate, this plan would offer 
minimal incentives to evade. Taxing all income at the source eliminates more than one billion 1099 
forms and simplifies enforcement considerably.
<P>
Gramm flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;				B
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While better than current law, some forms of income 
are double taxed and others maintain a preference. This will encourage taxpayers to arrange their 
affairs in ways to minimize or avoid taxes.
<p>
Buchanan flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;				B
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Like the Gramm plan, one low rate will reduce incentives 
to avoid, but differential treatment based on sources and uses of income will create opportunities 
for evasive behavior.

<p>
<b>INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In a world where capital can react quickly to changes 
in a nation's business climate, a tax system which minimizes the tax burden will attract increased 
investment. This will translate into more jobs and higher incomes. Unfortunately, America has been 
moving in the wrong direction.
<p>
Kemp Commission report: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		A
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One of the panel's recommendations is to eliminate 
the foreign tax provisions of the current code which do so much to drive jobs offshore and hinder 
the competitiveness of U.S. firms. Combined with the other features -- tax at a low rate and tax only 
one time -- this would benefit America immensely.
<P>
Forbes flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Eliminating the double tax on income earned 
overseas and fixing all the problems imposed on income earned in the U.S. will increase 
competitiveness and boost job creation substantially.
<p>
Gramm flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			B
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One low rate will help, but the multiple taxation of 
capital will prevent complete realization of possible benefits. 
<p>
Buchanan flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 			C
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Has the same pluses as the Gramm plan, but the threat of 
higher taxes on trade will have a sharply negative effect on U.S. competitiveness.

<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The current income tax system demands 
comprehensive reform. High rates punish success, excessive complexity drains productive 
resources, and punitive taxation of capital income retards savings and investment. Of the many 
proposals that have been offered to correct these flaws, reforms based on the pure flat tax are the 
best. Direct consumption taxes, assuming no loopholes and complete repeal of the income tax (16th 
Amendment and all), are very attractive, with modified flat taxes generally next in desirability. The 
closer a plan resembles the current system, needless to say, the more limited its benefits.

<a href="fyi87c1.gif">Chart 1</a>: Economic Growth Boosts Housing Values<br>
<a href="fyi87c2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Home Values and Income: Closely Linked; Tax Deduction and Home Values: No Relationship <P>
	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Last year, the National Association of Realtors 
hired Data Resources Inc./McGraw-Hill, a leading econometric firm, to analyze the economic 
effects of a flat tax. The resulting study concluded that the enactment of this tax, which would 
treat all taxpayers and all income equally, would result in a 15 percent drop in housing 
values,<sup>1 </sup>due largely to the elimination of the home mortgage interest deduction. This 
study is now being used by opponents of the flat tax. Yet numerous experts have pointed out that 
the DRI/McGraw-Hill study has serious methodological flaws that make its conclusions highly 
suspect.<sup> 2</sup> A more reasonable method of analysis -- one that looks at the historical 
relationship between personal income growth and the value of owner-occupied housing, 
combined with the range of estimates showing faster economic growth under a flat tax -- shows 
that home values actually would rise by as much as 7 to 14 percent by the fifth year after 
enactment of a flat tax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These results should come as no surprise.  As <a href="fyi87c2.gif">Chart 2</a> illustrates, home values consistently have mirrored changes in personal income. When the 
economy is strong and incomes rise, consumers spend more on almost all goods and services. As 
a major component of family budgets, housing has followed this pattern. Although projecting the 
value of housing into the future involves a level of uncertainty, a wide range of studies indicate 
that adoption of a flat tax would boost the annual rate of growth in gross domestic product (GDP) 
by at least 1 percentage point for a period of five or more years.<sup>3 </sup> Because personal 
income would rise with increases in GDP, it is possible to use the strong historical relationship 
between income and house values to generate estimates of how home values will change under 
the flat tax.<sup>4 </sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Critics of the flat tax argue that it is improper to use 
historical data to predict the future value of homes under a flat tax because, they say, the 
relationship between home values and personal income exists only in a world where mortgage 
interest is deductible. Yet if the deduction were indeed the critical variable, there should be a 
strong relationship between housing values in the past and the tax value of the deduction. In 
1980, before the Reagan marginal tax rate cuts, for instance, a dollar of home mortgage interest 
cost an upper-income taxpayer only 30 cents. In 1988, that same taxpayer paid 72 cents out of 
pocket for every dollar in interest payments. As <a href="fyi87c2.gif">Chart 2</a> indicates, however, the tax value of the 
deduction had no discernible impact on the value of housing over the period.
<p>


<b>Why the Realtors' Study Is Flawed</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If the historical evidence and economic projections 
suggest that a flat tax will increase home values, why did the realtors' study predict a sharp 
decline? The reason is that it used several very questionable assumptions. For example:
<p>
<b>1. DRI/McGraw-Hill analyzed a flat tax with an initial rate of 25 percent, gradually 
phasing down to 21 percent.</b> The DRI/McGraw-Hill study used a much higher tax rate 
than is used in existing flat tax plans. Crucially, the lower the rate, the larger the economic gains 
under a flat tax, and the higher the positive impact on home values. Even the Clinton 
Administration's Treasury Department, no friend of the flat tax, refused to use a rate higher than 
21 percent when estimating the effects of a flat tax on the economy.
<p>
<b>2. DRI/McGraw-Hill did not properly estimate the drop in interest rates under a flat 
tax.</b> According to the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, interest rates would drop by 25 
percent to 35 percent under a flat tax.<sup>5 </sup> Other experts have similar estimates.<sup>6 </sup> DRI/McGraw-Hill stands alone in basing its estimate of likely interest rate declines -- and 
thus the positive effect on home values -- on the comparison between municipal bond rates and 
10-year federal bonds, rather than interest-bearing assets of equal risk such as high-grade 
corporate bonds.
<p>
<b>3. DRI/McGraw-Hill overestimated by 30 percent the average marginal tax rate which 
applies to homeowners.</b> Doing so significantly overstates the tax benefits of the deduction 
and exaggerates the change in a taxpayer's cost of mortgage interest under a flat tax.
<p>
<b>4. The study assumed that financial assets would lose value under a flat tax.</b> This 
assumption is at odds with academic analyses of the flat tax and defies common sense. Lower 
taxes on savings and investment actually would boost the value of financial assets by increasing 
the after-tax stream of income they produce.
<p>
<b>5. DRI/McGraw-Hill failed to include the impact of higher disposable incomes on home 
values.</b> The study does conclude that the flat tax would increase economic growth but fails 
to factor back in the effects on house prices. This is inexplicable.
<p>
	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The flat tax represents a direct threat to 
powerful vested interests that feel they benefit from today's deductions. Unfortunately, many of 
these special interests are willing to disseminate erroneous information to Americans in an effort 
to preserve the tax breaks they now enjoy. The DRI/McGraw-Hill study is based on an unsound 
methodology which leaves it alone in its dire predictions that housing values will fall. Historical 
evidence on the relationship between performance of the economy and house prices, however, 
clearly shows us that a flat tax would be a bonanza for homeowners.

<title>Why Liberals Should Support the Flat Tax -- Heritage</title>

<center>
<h3>WHY LIBERALS SHOULD SUPPORT THE FLAT TAX</h3><br>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/mitchell.htm">Daniel J. Mitchell</a><br>
McKenna Senior Fellow in Political Economy<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 85<br>
February 7, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The flat tax continues to gain support across the country as more and more Americans realize that the existing tax code cannot be fixed and should be replaced by a fair and simple tax code. Polls show that workers, investors, savers, entrepreneurs, farmers, small business owners, and the elderly are among the groups of Americans drawn to the proposal because they feel they will pay less in taxes, benefit from a faster growing economy, or simply avoid the hassle of today's mind-numbing tax code.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There is one group, however, which should support the flat tax but has yet to do so: liberals. Consider the following eight features and consequences of a flat tax which one would expect to appeal specifically to this group:
<p><ul>
<li> The key philosophical principle of the flat tax is equality. All taxpayers play by the same rules, no matter how wealthy they are.
<p>
<li> Lower rates result in the rich shouldering more of the tax burden. This happened in the 1920s, the 1960s, and the 1980s.
<p>
<li> Deductions disproportionately benefit the wealthy and others able to exploit loopholes. Eliminating them with a flat tax allows for a lower rate for those with lower incomes.
<p>
<li> Radically simplifying the code with a flat tax will help end the corrupting effect of tax lobbyists and prevent politicians from exploiting the tax system to generate campaign contributions.
<p>
<li> Because of a generous family-based allowance, the poor are shielded from the income tax burden. A family of four pays no income tax on their first $33,000.
<p>
<li> The flat tax will boost wages and income for lower-income and middle-income workers by eliminating the double, triple, and sometimes quadruple taxation of capital.
<p>
<li> A pro-growth tax system will reduce the budget deficit by increasing the tax base and reducing demands for government spending.
<p>
<li> Lower-income and middle-income taxpayers will enjoy a more financially secure retirement if they are not forced to pay a double tax on their savings.
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;History illustrates that a flat tax will generate immense benefits for Americans of all backgrounds and incomes.<sup>1</sup>  Honest liberals -- those who are genuinely concerned about helping the less fortunate and who favor eliminating special advantages for the rich and powerful -- should be among the strongest supporters of sweeping tax reform. There are some on the left, however, who oppose the flat tax in the belief that some short-term political advantage can be gained from fomenting class warfare -- even if the ultimate victims are those who have the most to gain from a more rapidly growing economy.

<p>
<b>EIGHT REASONS FOR LIBERALS TO SUPPORT A FLAT TAX</b>
<P>
<b>1. A flat tax promotes equality.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Liberals often say they are fighting for equality. No other word better describes the flat tax, whose key principle is that the law should apply equally to all taxpayers and all income. More specifically, supporters of the flat tax believe all taxpayers should play by the same rules and that government should not grant special preferences or impose special penalties based on how income is earned or spent. Equality under the law means a tax system with just one rate for all levels of income. Anything else explicitly allows the government to discriminate among taxpayers and ultimately is self-defeating.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a href="fyi85c1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows how the principle of equality applies to taxpayers with different taxable incomes. Under a system that treats citizens equally, a taxpayer with twice as much taxable income as his neighbor pays twice as much in taxes.
<p>
<b>2. The rich pay more.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Liberals often equate a fair tax system with one that results in the rich paying more. If so, the flat tax is the answer to their prayers. Why?  While the flat tax is designed to treat all taxpayers equally, history strongly suggests that one effect of moving to a flat tax is that the share of the income tax burden borne by the rich actually will increase. America has had three major episodes of tax rate reduction -- in the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s. In each case, lower tax rates removed incentives to hide income, shelter income, reduce earnings, and transfer money overseas. The result: Upper-income taxpayers were willing to earn and report more taxable income, and the amount of tax they paid increased. The evidence speaks for itself.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the 1920s, tax rates were reduced from a high of 73 percent to 25 percent between 1921 and 1926. Did the rich get a free ride?  Hardly: The share of the tax burden paid by those making more than $50,000 -- a great deal of money back then -- rose dramatically, climbing from 44.2 percent in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the 1960s, the Kennedy tax cuts lowered the top rate from 91 percent to 70 percent. The result: Tax collections from those making over $50,000 per year climbed by 57 percent between 1963 and 1966, while tax collections from those earning below $50,000 rose 11 percent. As a result, the rich saw their portion of the income tax burden climb from 11.6 percent to 15.1 percent.<sup>3</sup>

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan reduced the top rate from 70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent in 1988. The share of income taxes paid by the top 10 percent of earners jumped significantly, climbing from 48 percent in 1981 to 57 percent in 1988 (see <a href="fyi85c2.gif">Chart 2</a>).<sup>4</sup>
<p><b>3. Deductions help the rich.</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Liberals presumably do not favor laws that confer special advantages on those with more income. Thus, the elimination of all loopholes, preferences, credits, exclusions, subsidies, and deductions under the flat tax should be particularly attractive to them. As <a href="fyi85c3.gif">Chart 3</a> illustrates, the three best-known deductions offer almost no benefit to the poor and middle class. Upper-income and wealthy taxpayers, by contrast, benefit immensely.

<p>
<b>4. A flat tax ends special-interest tax lobbying.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are 12,609 special interests officially registered to lobby in Washington, and the tax code is one of their chief targets.<sup>5</sup>  Former Members of Congress, former legislative staff members, consulting firm employees, and law firm partners are among those who can earn up to $500 an hour wielding influence in the tax-writing committees of Congress. It is precisely this process that has caused America's tax system, which began in 1913 with one simple form, to turn into a monstrosity encompassing more than 600 forms in which even the simplest -- the 1040EZ -- is accompanied by 33 pages of fine-print instructions.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While lobbyists are very well compensated for their efforts (and not all of them are looking for special loopholes; some are fighting to keep their tax bills from increasing), the biggest winners from the convoluted tax code are the politicians. <a href="fyi85c4.gif">Chart 4</a> shows the average contribution levels for members of the House tax-writing committee compared with the average for other House members. This is one reason why the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees are considered the plum assignments for new Members of Congress.
<p>
<b>5. The poor pay no tax.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The only loophole in the flat tax is the one that protects the poor. Under the Armey-Shelby proposal (H.R. 2060, S. 1050), a family of four does not pay the 17 percent rate until its annual income reaches $33,300. This personal allowance, which is indexed to inflation to prevent bracket creep, is considerably above the poverty level and will ensure that even the low rate of a flat tax is not an impediment to those trying to climb the economic ladder.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As <a href="fyi85c5.gif">Chart 5</a> illustrates, the personal allowance also has the effect of making the tax system progressive. The tax rate on a family of four with $30,000 of income would be zero compared to an effective rate of 2.8 percent for a family with $40,000 of income and 5.7 percent for a family with earnings of $50,000. The effective rate continues to rise with income, reaching 9.5 percent on $75,000 of income, 11.3 percent on $100,000 of income, and 14.2 percent for a family with income of $200,000. For the well-to-do, the effective rate approaches 17 percent, as families with $500,000 of income pay 15.9 percent and a millionaire's household would pay 16.4 percent.
<p>
<b>6. A flat tax promotes higher wages.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Considerable discussion has been devoted to the plight of the middle class. While some assertions are false (for example, middle-class incomes have not fallen over the last 20 years), there is no question that earnings could and should be rising at a faster rate. Fortunately, there is widespread agreement among all economists that the way to increase incomes is to make workers more productive by giving them more and better tools with which to produce. As liberal economist Paul Samuelson has written:
<p><blockquote>

	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What happens to the wage rate now that each person works with more capital goods?  Because each worker has more capital to work with, his or her marginal product rises. Therefore, the competitive real wage rises as workers become worth more to capitalists and meet with spirited bidding up of their market wage rates.<sup>6</sup></blockquote><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Or consider the views of the White House. In the 1994 Economic Report of the President, the Administration noted that:<P><blockquote>	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The reasons for wanting to raise the investment share of the GDP [gross domestic product] are straightforward: Workers are more productive when they are equipped with more and better capital, more productive workers earn higher real wages, and higher real wages are the mainspring of higher living standards. Few economic propositions are better supported than these -- or more important.
</blockquote><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;History shows a very close relationship between worker income and productivity, indicating the importance of capital formation. Since the flat tax eliminates the multiple taxation of capital income, levels of savings and investment will climb, worker productivity will increase, and wages will rise.<sup>7</sup><P><b>7. Budget deficits are reduced.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another desirable feature of the flat tax, at least for liberals, is that government <a href="fyi85c6.gif">revenues will rise</a>. As discussed earlier, the United States has had three major periods of tax rate reduction -- the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s. In addition to the fact that the rich paid a greater share of the tax burden and the economy boomed, these reductions resulted in dramatic increases in tax revenues.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the 1920s, the top tax rate was slashed from 73 percent in 1921 to 25 percent by 1926. Because of improved incentives to work, save, and invest, income tax revenues increased substantially, rising from $719 million in 1921 to nearly $1.2 billion in 1928, an increase of more than 61 percent during a period of virtually no inflation.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The White House today would do well to heed the words of then Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, who wrote that "The history of taxation shows that taxes which are inherently excessive are not paid. The high rates inevitably put pressure upon the taxpayer to withdraw his capital from productive business and invest it in tax-exempt securities or to find other lawful methods of avoiding the realization of taxable income. The result is that the sources of taxation are drying up; wealth is failing to carry its share of the tax burden; and capital is being diverted into channels which yield neither revenue to the Government nor profit to the people."<sup>8</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the 1960s, President John F. Kennedy proposed a series of tax rate reductions that resulted in legislation which reduced the maximum rate from 91 percent in 1963 to 70 percent by 1965. Just as happened in the 1920s, tax revenues again grew significantly, rising by more than 16 percent between 1963 and 1966.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As President Kennedy remarked in 1962, "an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenues to balance our budget just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits.... In short, it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now."<sup>10</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan presided over two major pieces of tax legislation which together reduced the top tax rate from 70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent by 1988. As supporters predicted, the tax cuts triggered the longest peacetime expansion of the economy in the nation's history. Critics charge, however, that Reagan's program caused big deficits.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These accusations may resonate politically in some quarters, but they are false. Reagan's critics conveniently forget that the first tax rate reductions, in 1981 and 1982, were offset by bracket creep and previously legislated payroll tax increases. Once the economy received an unambiguous tax cut, beginning in January 1983, income tax revenues climbed dramatically, increasing by more than 54 percent (28 percent after adjusting for inflation) by 1989.<sup>11</sup><p><b>8. Americans will have a more secure retirement.</b><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;America's Social Security system is in deep trouble. The bipartisan entitlement commission estimates the system's unfunded liability (the differences between how much is promised and how much will be available) at a staggering $7.3 trillion. With the baby boom generation approaching retirement, the Social Security Administration projects that the system will begin to run a deficit in less than 15 years. While there are ways to avert this upcoming catastrophe (the best option would be to follow the Chilean example of privatization),<sup>12</sup> it is widely expected that lawmakers will be reluctant to address such a politically charged issue.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This approach, unfortunately, means that the so-called baby boomers will face significant benefit reductions compared with what they are being promised and will be forced to augment their retirement income with private savings. The current tax system, however, punishes those who attempt to save and invest by imposing double, triple, and even quadruple taxation of savings and investment income. Even if income is "only" double-taxed, the effect on savings is dramatic. Chart 7 shows the difference in the nest eggs of someone who saves $1,000 a year under the current system and someone who saves the same amount in a flat tax world in which income is taxed just once. As shown, the double tax on interest income imposed by today's code dramatically redu
ces the amount which can be saved for retirement. By taxing income only once, the flat tax would allow interest earnings to compound, resulting in a nest egg almost 92 percent larger than the same amount of savings would generate under current law. See <a href="fyi85c7.gif">Chart 7</a> for the comparison between private savings with and without a flat tax.  
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. tax system ostensibly is designed to make the rich pay more and improve living standards for those with lower incomes. Even a cursory examination of the facts, however, underscores that the biggest victims of a progressive income tax which punishes success are precisely those who are on the bottom rungs of the economic ladder. By achieving the effects outlined above, a flat tax therefore should attract the support of well-meaning people of all ideological persuasions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This is a particularly important test for liberals. They must decide which is more important: maintaining lobbying power in Washington and keeping a tax system that may satisfy an ideological impulse to punish success, or adopting a system that ends special-interest corruption and helps boost the living standards of the less fortunate.

<title>Why Combining Kidsave with a Child Tax Credit Makes Good 
Sense -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3>WHY COMBINING "KIDSAVE" WITH A CHILD TAX CREDIT 
MAKES GOOD SENSE</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Stuart M. Butler</a><br> 
Vice President and Director of Domestic Policy Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 444<br>
February 6, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As congressional leaders and the 
White House continue to argue over a balanced budget plan, a proposal 
known as "KidSave" has resurfaced. First unveiled last October by Senators 
Joseph Lieberman (D-CT) and Robert Kerrey (D-NE), KidSave would enable 
parents eligible for any new child tax credit created in tax legislation to place 
that credit in an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) in their child's name. 
This is a valuable and important proposal. If congressional supporters of the 
$500-per-child tax credit were to include this feature in their plan, it would 
help build Democratic support for the tax plan. And if adopted as an option 
for parents in a final compromise tax bill, this innovation would help provide 
financial security for children while significantly improving the tax code.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;KidSave would work as follows. If a 
parent was eligible for a child tax credit of $500 per year (the amount in the 
vetoed Balanced Budget Act), the parent could place that amount of money 
into an IRA in the child's name. As that account grew over the years, taxes 
would be deferred on the principal and earnings while the funds remained in 
the account -- just like a conventional IRA.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The rules governing KidSave IRAs 
would be exactly the same as those for conventional IRAs, with one 
exception:  The child could take funds out of the account temporarily in the 
form of a ten-year loan (much as certain life insurance and pension plans 
allow loans against equity), without incurring taxes at the time, to help pay for 
higher education. Otherwise, as with conventional IRAs, after-tax funds could 
be withdrawn without tax penalty by the child when he or she reached age 59 
1/2, or withdrawn earlier with a penalty.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The original Lieberman-Kerrey 
proposal would have required the child tax credit to be placed in a KidSave 
IRA. Such a restriction understandably found little support among lawmakers, 
especially conservatives. Besides introducing unacceptable restrictions on the 
right of parents to decide how best to use the money for their children, the 
requirement would have had the effect of denying immediate help to children 
in many low-income families, where basic day-to-day needs are a higher 
priority than a more secure retirement. In the discussions now taking place 
over KidSave, the consensus is that placing tax credit money in a special IRA 
should be an option. Such an option would be a welcome reform of the tax 
code, since it would reduce the double-taxation bias against savings, making it 
more likely that working parents would set aside funds to help secure their 
children's future. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Allowing parents to set up IRAs for 
their children would help children in two particularly important ways.
<P>
1.) The KidSave option would give children a large financial cushion against 
the doubtful ability of Medicare and Social Security to deliver adequate 
benefits in the future. The Medicare trustees warned the nation last year that 
the Medicare hospital trust fund will run out of money by 2002. Congress 
passed reforms that would help delay the exhaustion of the fund, but President 
Clinton vetoed that legislation. Even if the congressional reforms became law, 
however, they could not guarantee solvency of the program when today's 
newborns reach retirement, only delay the eventual collapse. Similarly, the 
baby boom generation will impose such heavy burdens on the Social Security 
retirement program that the following generation will have little or no 
prospect of getting back even the money they pay into the system, let alone 
any return on their contributions.
<p>
2.) KidSave would make it easier for today's worried parents to establish a 
retirement fund for their children as a cushion against the probability that 
Medicare and Social Security will be inadequate. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although $500 per year into an IRA 
may seem a trivial investment in a child's retirement, compounding would 
lead to a substantial nest egg. For example, consider the case of parents 
deciding to take advantage of the KidSave option for their newborn and 
placing $500 per year into an IRA for 18 years (the maximum under the 
vetoed congressional tax credit plan). Assume a real rate of return of five 
percent. Even if the child, as an adult, added nothing to the IRA, it would be 
worth $140,000 in today's dollars when he or she reached 65 (the Clinton-
proposed credit, which is smaller, available for only 13 years, and more 
restricted, would be worth $100,000 -- assuming the child was eligible).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;KidSave would give the child an 
additional means of financing his or her higher education. With the cost of 
college an enormous barrier to higher education for the children of many 
working families, permitting these families to invest in a KidSave IRA would 
provide a means of shouldering the burden. Under the proposal, children at 
college could borrow against their KidSave IRAs, paying back the loan (into 
their own retirement accounts) over the next ten years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Again, compounding leads to 
significant funds for such a loan. Assuming the same case described above, 
the child would have just over $14,000 in his or her account at age 18, in 
today's dollars. This compares with an average cost (tuition and required fees) 
of $10,500 for four years at a public college (by contrast, an eligible child 
would have a maximum of $10,400 under the Clinton proposal).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The KidSave proposal, combined 
with the tax credit for families with children, thus would be a significant 
savings vehicle to help families deal with the cost of college and the future 
uncertainty of Medicare and Social Security. And it is good tax policy, since it 
moves closer to a proper treatment of savings in the tax code. But placing 
their child tax credit in a KidSave IRA should be an option for families, not a 
requirement (as under the original proposal), so families can decide for 
themselves whether the credit should be used for urgent immediate needs or 
future security. As an option, KidSave would be a very welcome 
improvement to legislation to provide much-needed tax relief to families with 
children.

<title>Why Tax Relief Is Necessary in a Balanced Budget -- Heritage</title>

<a href="tax_relf.gif">Table</a>: A Balanced Budget With Tax Relief Would Add $142 Billion to GDP...
<p>
Some policymakers maintain that tax relief is out of place in the quest for a balanced budget. They 
argue that tax cuts cannot be justified because they make the goal of a balanced budget even harder 
to reach.
<p>
But contrary to this view, the inclusion of tax cuts should be viewed as a critical component of any 
balanced budget plan. The reason is that reducing or eliminating tax relief on income from capital 
would lower potential economic growth significantly and would not in fact make room for new 
spending.
<p>
Economists at The Heritage Foundation recently used one of the principal econometric models of 
the U.S. economy to project the economic and fiscal effects of eliminating the tax relief elements of 
the congressional balanced budget act. This analysis shows:
<p><ul>
<li>The congressional balanced budget plan with tax cuts, as vetoed by President Clinton, would 
add $112 billion more to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over the next seven years than the same 
congressional plan <i>without</i> tax cuts.
<p>
<li>The reductions in taxes on capital (including the capital gains tax relief) accounts for $66 
billion of this additional GDP and leads to a stronger economy in the long run.
</ul><p>
Heritage Foundation economists conducted this analysis of the congressional balanced budget plan 
using the econometric model developed by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates. Laurence H. Meyer 
& Associates is a nationally recognized consulting firm specializing in economic 
analysis.<sup>1 </sup>  The Meyer model is used by many major public agencies and private firms, 
including the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the Office of Management and Budget, 
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Congressional Budget Office, the National 
Association of Realtors, and the National Association of Home Builders.<sup>2 </sup>
<p>
The congressional tax relief plan includes a reduction of taxes on families and on capital. The lower 
taxes on family income include primarily the $500-per-child tax credit, a reduction in the marriage 
penalty, and the adoption tax credit. The lower tax rates on income from capital include tax changes 
affecting capital gains, individual retirement accounts, the alternative minimum tax, and the estate 
and gift tax provisions.
<p>

<b>The Benefits of Reducing Taxes on Family Income</b>
<p>
The cornerstone of the reductions in taxes on family income is the $500-per-child tax credit. The 
immediate benefit of the $500-per-child tax credit included in the congressional balanced budget is 
an increase in household disposable income. Although $500 may seem insignificant in light of the 
entire federal budget, it is a substantial benefit to individual families. As demonstrated by previous 
Heritage analysis, a family with a newborn baby could save the entire $500 each year for eighteen 
years and afford the tuition costs at an average public university.<sup>3 </sup>  Alternatively, an 
average family with two children could use the $1,000 credit to purchase one month's supply of 
food and mortgage.<sup>4 </sup>  This additional private sector savings and consumption made 
possible by the $500-per-child tax credit and other reductions in family income taxes will benefit 
the economy.
<p>
<b>The Benefits of Reducing Taxes on Capital</b>
<p>
The cornerstone of the reductions in taxes on capital is the capital gains tax relief. Owners of 
appreciated assets sell those assets largely for one of two reasons: either to meet extraordinary 
expenses (educational, medical, or other large and non-recurring costs) or to move their money 
from an inferior to a superior investment. When government takes less of this income, household 
spending stimulates economic activity and more efficient investment fuels economic growth. 
<p>
Not surprisingly, the impact of a capital gains tax cut on investment and economic growth is more 
important in the long run than its role in allowing households to pay big bills. Two reasons for this 
relative importance stand out. First, reducing the tax on capital gains lowers the cost of moving an 
investment from an average company to one that is exceptionally productive and well run. This 
lowering of the "switching" costs means that investors will play a larger role in promoting well run, 
productive companies. Thus, the economy as a whole is likely to be more efficient. Second, lower 
taxes on capital cause the cost of capital to fall. Lenders, for example, do not require quite as much 
interest on their capital loans in order to recoup the taxes they paid when they made the capital 
available to a borrower. Lower capital costs usually mean more investment by businesses in labor-
saving equipment, which commonly results in increased labor productivity. This increased 
productivity gets translated into higher wages and, through the wonders of the division of labor, 
more jobs.
<p>
The following <a href="tax_relf.gif">table</a> compares the level of various economic indicators that result from the 
congressional balanced budget plan with tax relief and the congressional balanced budget plan 
without tax relief. Specifically,
<p><ul>
<li>Gross Domestic Product would be $13.7 billion more in the year 2002 as a result of the 
congressional plan <i>with</i> tax relief compared to the same plan <i>without</i> tax relief.
<p>
<li>Real disposable income would be $23.1 billion more in the year 2002 as a result of the 
congressional plan <I>with</i> tax relief compared to the same plan <i>without</i> tax relief.
</ul><p>
Removing capital gains tax relief from the congressional balanced budget will not allow increased 
federal spending. The capital gains tax relief element of the congressional balanced budget plan 
actually <i>reduces</i> the deficit in every year through 2002. There are two reasons for this. 
First, a reduction in the capital gains tax rate will produce more declarations of capital gains and 
thus increase government revenue from the capital gains tax. Second, the capital gains tax reduction 
creates a stronger economy, thus increasing the federal tax base. 
<p>
Economists estimate that trillions of dollars in unrealized capital gains (perhaps as high as $7.5 
trillion) exist in the portfolios of American taxpayers.<sup>5</sup> Some economists have 
estimated that significant capital gains rate changes could produce substantial economic benefits 
and create revenue windfalls for federal and state governments. In an article last year for the 
<i>American Economic Review</i>, Leonard Burman and William Randolph, two leading tax 
economists on the staff of the Congressional Budget Office, estimated the response of taxpayers to 
rate reductions as being on the order of 6 to 1. That is, for every one percent drop in the rate, capital 
gains realizations would rise by 6 percent.<sup>6 </sup>  The federal government would collect tax 
revenues on these "windfall" capital gains that under the current tax rate would not have been 
declared.
<p>
The congressional tax relief proposal, including the capital gains tax reduction, would allow 
individuals and owners of capital to keep more of the money they otherwise would have paid in 
taxes. This additional private sector savings and spending would be allocated more efficiently than 
had the federal government spent the money and thus will lead to a stronger economy. A stronger 
economy, in turn, means a larger tax base from which the federal government can draw revenue.
<p>
The important complement to this analysis is that, contrary to popular belief, additional spending 
opportunities for the federal government would not be available if the capital gains tax relief 
element of the congressional balanced budget plan is eliminated. In fact, additional spending 
reductions would be necessary in the future to offset the potential revenue foregone by elimination 
of the capital gains tax reduction.
<p>
<b>TECHNICAL ASSUMPTIONS</b>
<p>
To conduct the simulation of the congressional budget plan, Heritage economists adjusted only 
those elements of the Laurence H. Meyer & Associates baseline forecast that deal with federal 
spending and federal tax policy. 
<p>
The analysis is based on spending reductions specified in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, passed 
by Congress and vetoed by President Clinton on December 6. For specific assumptions concerning 
these spending reductions see, William W. Beach and John S. Barry, <a href="fyi69.html">"What 
a Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to the Economy,"</a> Heritage Foundation 
F.Y.I. No. 69, November 14, 1995.
<p>
The major components of the congressional tax relief package were accounted for in the following 
manner:
<p><ul>
<li>A 50 percent exemption of individual capital gains was assumed for taxation purposes through 
2004. The maximum corporate capital gains tax rate was reduced from 35 percent to 28 percent.
<p>
<li>The average effective tax rate on individuals was reduced according to the annual value of the 
$500-per-child tax credit.
<P>
<li>Other provisions of the congressional tax relief package were accounted for by changing the 
effective tax rates on wages, dividends, and individuals.
</ul><p>
The analysis in this paper is based on the November economic forecast and projection of Laurence 
H. Meyer & Associates. This is the most recent economic forecast available from Laurence H. 
Meyer & Associates.
<p>
Note: Reduction in tax on income includes: family tax relief, the reduction in the marriage penalty; 
and the adoption tax credit. Reduction in tax on capital includes: tax changes affecting capital gains, 
IRAs, the alternative minimum tax, and the estate and gift tax provisions.

<title>How A Capital Gains Tax Cut Would Boost State Revenue -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>BALANCED BUDGET TALKING POINTS #8: 
HOW A CAPITAL GAINS TAX CUT WOULD BOOST STATE REVENUES</h3>

<a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William W. Beach</a><br>
Visiting Fellow in Tax Analysis<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 82<br>
December 29, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>
<a href="gain1.gif">Chart</a>: Estimated One-Time State Revenue Windfall...
<p>
The vetoed congressional budget plan would significantly cut effective taxes on capital gains, both 
for individuals and for businesses. The Heritage Foundation estimates that this important tax cut 
could cause millions of taxpayers to declare billions of dollars in capital gains during the first year 
of the lower effective rates. Because 40 states require taxpayers to report all capital gains declared 
on their federal tax forms, this sudden growth in capital gains may create a one-year state income 
tax windfall of $9.5 billion.
<P>
If taxpayers were to "unlock" appreciated assets during the first year of lower capital gains taxes 
under the congressional budget plan, states that tax capital gains would likely see their income tax 
revenues increase by an average of 11.6 percent.
<p>
Some states might experience an especially high one-time percentage increase in their income tax 
receipts. For example:
<p>
<a href="gain1.gif">Chart</a>: Estimated One-Time State Revenue Windfall...
<p>
The reason for this state tax "windfall" actually is quite simple. Reducing the tax rate for capital 
gains actually increases tax revenues from taxpayers who own appreciated assets. Experience over 
the last 25 years with changes in capital gains tax rates strongly indicates that rate decreases 
produce more declarations of capital gains and more capital gains taxes. Owners of appreciated 
assets who face high tax rates generally hold on to or "lock up" their assets in anticipation of lower 
future rates. When the rates come down, the amount of capital gains declarations goes up.
<p>
Economists estimate that trillions of dollars in unrealized or "locked up" capital gains (perhaps has 
high as $7.5 trillion) exists in the portfolios of American taxpayers.<sup>1 </sup>  Some 
economists have estimated that significant capital gains rate changes could produce substantial 
economic benefits and create revenue windfalls for federal and state governments.<sup>2 </sup> In 
an article last year for the <i>American Economic Review</i>, Leonard Burman and William 
Randolph, two leading tax economists on the staff of the Congressional Budget Office, estimated 
the response of taxpayers to rate reductions as being in the order of 6 to 1. That is, for every one 
percent drop in the rate, capital gains realizations rose by 6 percent.<sup>3 </sup>
<p>
The accompanying table shows three different state "windfall" scenarios, representing the range of 
expert opinion on how declarations are affected by a change in the rate. Each scenario uses the 
actual capital gains declarations by individuals as reported in the IRS's Public Use File for 
1991.<sup>4 </sup> The first set of columns shows the low estimate, which is calculated by 
multiplying the drop in the effective tax rate by 0.17. This means a 50 percent decrease in the 
effective capital gains tax rate results in a 51 percent increase in capital gains declarations. The third 
set of columns shows the high estimate, which multiplies the 50 percent decrease by the "transitory 
tax elasticity" estimated by Burman and Randolph: 6.42. While Burman and Randolph offer solid 
evidence for this strong level of taxpayer response to a change in the capital gains tax rate (which in 
the table leads to a 321 percent increase in declarations), it is probably imprudent for states to 
budget on this optimistic outcome. Thus, the second set of columns shows the midpoint between 
the low and high responses. The midpoint estimates reflect an increase in declarations of 156 
percent for a 50 percent drop in the tax rate.
<p>
As always, the difficult part of estimating tax revenues from capital gains is forecasting the value of 
the appreciated assets taxpayers will liquidate and the time of their liquidation. No particularly good 
and reliable revenue model exists for this purpose. Thus tax analysts are left with calculating 
historical responses to tax changes and assuming that the future will be very much like the past. 
<p>
Thus, these Heritage "mid-point" estimates, based as they are on data from a slow economic year 
and a mid-range level of taxpayer response, should give state revenue officers a reasonable number 
for incorporating into their state income tax forecasts. These middle estimates also illustrate 
conservatively that what happens to capital gains at the federal level has important implications for 
the revenues of 40 states. Besides the good economic effects on state economies resulting from a 
balanced budget with tax cuts, the congressional budget plan actually supplies the states with 
additional revenue that they can use to meet their additional responsibilities. If, on the other hand, 
the capital gains cut were to be pared back or eliminated in the negotiations over a budget, that 
would reduce or eliminate the revenue benefit to states with a capital gains tax.

information extracted from actual tax returns. The Public Use File for 1992 was not available at the 
time Heritage performed this analysis. Thus, Heritage is using the most recent, detailed tax data 
supplied to the general public by the IRS.

<h3>BALANCED BUDGET TALKING POINTS #7:  
WHAT CONGRESS'S BALANCED BUDGET WITH TAX CUTS WOULD MEAN FOR HOUSING</h3>

<a href="chart4.gif">Additional Housing Starts with a Balanced Budget and Tax Cuts</a><br>
<a href="chart9.gif">Conventional Mortgage Rates: Current Law vs. a Balanced Budget</a>

<p>
Congress's plan to balance the budget over seven years with tax cuts, vetoed on December 6 by President Clinton, would significantly improve the housing of many renters and homeowners while lowering their housing costs. According to an econometric analysis by The Heritage Foundation, adopting the spending and tax policy changes contained in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would likely lead to:
<p><ul>
<li>104,000 additional housing starts worth $11 billion over the period 1996 through 2002;
<p>
<li>New or improved housing for 1.8 million Americans;
<p>
<li>A drop in mortgage interest rates, with total payments on a $100,000 mortgage about $10,000 less in today's dollars over 30 years than a mortgage purchased under current budget and tax law; and
<p>
<li>A 4 percent drop in the cost of housing by 2002 (principally through decreases in the cost of capital and lower interest rates), with the value of existing housing maintained at or near current levels by the growing demand for new homes.
</ul><p>
This good news on housing reflects the stronger economy that economists at The Heritage Foundation predict would result from the vetoed Balanced Budget Act of 1995.<sup>1</sup>  Incomes and output would rise, inflation and interest rates would fall, and the spending and tax cuts proposed by Congress would lead to significant growth in productivity and investment. Each has a positive effect on housing. Specifically, the boost in new home construction would produce widespread benefits, and the tax policy provisions of the Act would lead simultaneously to lower housing costs.
<p>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> conducted this analysis of the congressional budget plan using an economic model of the U.S. economy developed by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, a nationally recognized economics consulting firm whose model is used routinely by major private firms and by such public agencies as the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the White House Office of Management and Budget, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Congressional Budget Office.
<p>

<b>Growth in New Home Construction</b>
<p>
For a graphical representation, see <a href="chart4.gif">Additional Housing Starts with a Balanced Budget and Tax Cuts</a>
<p>
The healthier economy that flows from Congress's tax and spending cuts produces two important effects on family housing.
<p>
First, the tax reductions, particularly the cuts in capital gains taxes, would jump start a boom in new investments by households and businesses.<sup>2</sup>  The Meyer model indicates that investors would pour an additional $11 billion (adjusted for inflation) into the housing sector as a result of the congressional budget plan. Without the tax and spending cuts, these new investments in family housing likely would not be made.<p>Home builders would use these new funds to construct an estimated 51,200 new single-family homes and 52,800 new multi-family dwellings over the seven-year period from 1996 through 2002.
<p>
This construction activity would mean employment and income growth in the housing industry, in the banking and real estate sectors, and in thousands of other companies that sell new homeowners everything from telephones to tabletops.
<p>
Second, these new investment dollars would provide improved housing for nearly 700,000 families. The model projects 7,200 starts of 2-to-4-unit dwellings and 45,600 starts of 5-or-more-unit dwellings. Assuming that all dwellings in the 2-to-4 category are actually 2-unit dwellings and all in the 5-or-more category are only 5-unit buildings, then the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 could provide new apartments for 288,000 families. Add to this number the 51,200 families who would be moving into single-family housing, and it becomes apparent that Congress's budget plan will significantly improve the housing of many Americans. Specifically: 
<p><ul>
<li>An additional 339,200 families could move into new housing over the next seven years as a result of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. Assuming a national average family size of 2.63, this means 892,100 people could enjoy new housing over this period.<sup>3</sup><P><li>Assuming that the 339,200 dwellings vacated by these families who are moving up in housing are purchased or rented by another 339,200 families looking to improve their own housing, the total number of people affected by these new housing starts could be 1,784,200.</ul><p>
<b>Reduced Housing Costs</b>
<p>
While the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would contribute significantly to the welfare of Americans through its salutary influence on housing, the legislation's benefits for homeowners and renters would not end there. The Act's role in stimulating the growth of investment and reducing the after-tax cost of capital (largely through reductions in the effective tax rate on capital gains) reduces the cost of housing. The Meyer model projects that the cost of housing will be 4 percent lower by 2002 than it otherwise would be under current law. Two factors explain this drop in the relative price of housing.
<p>
First, Congress's budget plan would reduce the costs of capital directly by reducing the effective tax rate on capital gains. For example, if Jones is thinking about cashing out an appreciated asset (say, a company stock) and loaning the proceeds to Smith, who is building an apartment building, Jones will consider the taxes he or she must pay on the capital gain as an important part of making the loan. If Jones paid a high capital gain tax, then he or she will demand a higher rate of return on the investment. Thus, dropping the effective tax rate on capital gains works to lower the cost of capital for those who borrow. The Meyer model predicts that the after-tax cost of capital by 2002 would be a full percentage point lower than it would be under current law.
<p>
Because capital costs are an important part of the costs landlords must cover by the rents they receive, one highly possible outcome of tax cuts is lower than expected rental payments by families in apartments or single-family rental property.
<p>
Similarly, the prices of new single-family homes will rise less rapidly in a world with tax cuts than in a world without them for the very same reason:  Homebuilders will be paying less for the capital they need for home construction.
<p>
Second, the relative price of housing would drop under the vetoed plan because mortgages would be less costly. The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 not only would cut the effective rate on capital gains, but also would permit middle and lower income families with children to keep $23 billion more of their income each year through the child tax credit. The Meyer model indicates that families would use a portion of this money to buy stocks and bonds and to increase their personal savings accounts. These actions would increase the supply of funds available for investment. Thus, the mortgage interest rate (like all of the major interest rates in the Meyer model) would fall because the after-tax cost of capital would decline and the supply of investment dollars rise.
<p>
For a graphical representation, see <a href="chart9.gif">Conventional Mortgage Rates: Current Law vs. a Balanced Budget</a>
<p>
The 0.4 percent drop in the mortgage interest rate from what it otherwise would be means that a $100,000 home loan would cost about $10,000 less in today's dollars over a typical 30-year loan repayment period.
<p>
Lower borrowing costs would allow more families to enter the housing market, which would contribute to price stability in housing and the preservation of household net wealth.
<p>
This important role of lower interest rates -- preserving the value of all homes through the competitive price bidding of home buyers -- explains in part the impressive growth in household net worth by 2002:  The Meyer model projects that, at the end of the seven-year balancing period, households will be worth nearly $200 billion more than they otherwise would have been under current law. 
<p>
It is benefits of this magnitude that President Clinton has foregone through his veto. Not only does the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 inadvertently create a "housing program" of significant proportions; it also contributes to a general improvement in family financial well-being.

<h3><I>BALANCED BUDGET TALKING POINTS #6:
WHAT A BALANCED FEDERAL BUDGET WITH TAX CUTS WOULD MEAN FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE RETIREES</i></h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/barry.html">John S. Barry</a><br>

F.Y.I. No. 79<br>
December 11, 1995<br>
<hr width=-50%></center><p>
Congress's balanced budget plan with tax relief, vetoed on December 6 by President Clinton, would expand the purchasing power of today's seniors and allow younger Americans to save more money for their retirement. These are the findings of an analysis by The Heritage Foundation using one of the principal econometric models of the U.S. economy.<sup>1</sup>  According to this statistical analysis, the congressional plan would mean:<p><b>For Current Retirees</b><p>A retiree showing $2,150 in capital gains for 1995 would realize $245 in additional after-tax income from a reduction in the capital gains tax.<p>A senior citizen with only $25,000 per year in nominal dollars for retirement could see an increase of $1,125 in real purchasing power over the next ten years due to decreased inflation.<p><b>For Future Retirees</b>
<p>
A worker saving $500 annually before taxes in the proposed "super IRA" for 40 years would realize an additional $3,070 in today's dollars compared with putting the same amount in a conventional IRA.
<p>
A 25-year-old couple raising one newborn child could save $41,150 in today's dollars for their retirement by saving the $500-per-child annual tax credit.
<p>
A young couple buying a home with a $100,000 mortgage could save $33,890 in today's dollars for their retirement from decreased monthly mortgage payments.
<p>
Economists at The Heritage Foundation conducted an interim econometric analysis of the congressional balanced budget plan using the economic model developed by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates,<sup>2</sup> a nationally recognized economic consulting firm. The Meyer model is used by many major public agencies and private firms, such as the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the Office of Management and Budget, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and the Congressional Budget Office.<sup>3</sup><p>The positive benefits to current and future retirees from the congressional balanced budget plan are discussed below. These include increased after-tax income from lower capital gains tax rates; expanded purchasing power from lower inflation; and increased potential retirement income from super IRAs, the $500-per-child tax credit, and lower mortgage rates.<p><b>Benefits to Current Retirees</b><p>Increased After-Tax Income from Lower Capital Gains Taxes. The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 lowers the effective tax rate on capital gains by 50 percent for individual tax filers through a deduction of half the net taxable gain. Thus, an individual in the 28 percent tax bracket would see his effective tax rate on capital gains drop to 14 percent.<sup>4</sup>  Contrary to popular belief, the capital gains tax reduction is not a tax break enjoyed primarily by the rich. The typical household declaring a capital gain in 1991 had income from sources <i>other than capital gains</i> of $58,729.<sup>5</sup>  For seniors claiming a capital gain in 1991, the average income from sources <i>other than capital gains</i> was $43,637, with an average gain of $2,151.<p>A reduction in the capital gains tax is particularly important for today's retirees who have invested in capital assets as a means of saving for their retirement. There are two major reasons why the capital gains tax cut is so important to seniors:<p><ul><li>Senior citizens claim a disproportionate amount of capital gains. Households containing taxpayers 
who are over the age of 65 or blind constituted only 3.5 percent of all returns in 1991 but accounted for more than 27 percent of taxpaying households declaring capital gains. 
<p>
<li>Current law imposes a surtax on Social Security benefits. For example, a retiree facing a base marginal tax rate of 15 percent also must pay a surtax of 7.5 percent. This is why many individuals face higher marginal tax rates during their retirement than over the rest of their lifetime.<sup>6</sup>  Thus, the 50 percent exclusion may be more valuable during a taxpayer's retirement years than during his working years.
</ul><p>
To understand the benefits of the capital gains exclusion for seniors, consider a newly retired couple realizing $2,150 in capital gains during 1995. If this couple faces the lowest marginal tax rate of 15 percent and the Social Security surtax of 7.5 percent, they will receive only $1,665 in after-tax income from these gains. Under the congressional balanced budget plan, however, this same retired couple would realize $1,910, an increase of $245 over current law.
<p>
To put this in perspective, an additional $245 amounts to:
<p><ul>
<li>One month of groceries for the average retired household, or
<p>
<li>Six months of housekeeping supplies for the average retired household.
</ul><p>
<b>Increased Purchasing Power from Lower Inflation.</b> Many senior citizens have saved a fixed amount of money for their retirement years. Seniors living on a fixed income are affected directly by inflation because it changes the purchasing power of their money. As inflation increases the prices of goods, consumers are able to purchase less:  Inflation eats away at purchasing power. Because retirees, as a rule, are more likely to be restricted to a fixed income, they will benefit disproportionately from a slower rate of inflation.
<p>
The economic simulation conducted by analysts at The Heritage Foundation indicates that prices likely will increase more slowly in the future because of a more efficient economy spurred by a balanced federal budget and tax relief. By 2002, inflation rates are projected by this analysis to be 0.7 percent below what is expected under current law. This means consumers will be able to purchase more goods with the same amount of money. For example, a retired household living on a fixed income of $25,000 per year will see their purchasing power increase by $1,125 in today's dollars over the course of the next ten years.
<p>
To put this in perspective, an additional $1,125 amounts to:
<p><ul>
<li>The amount an average retired household will spend on laundry and household cleaning over the next ten years,
<p>
<li>The amount an average retired household will spend on fresh milk and cream over the next ten years, or
<p>
<li>One-half the amount an average retired household will spend on furniture over the next ten years.<sup>7</sup></ul><p><b>Benefits to Future Retirees</b><p><b>Benefits from Super IRAs.</b> Current laws allow tax-free deposits of up to $2,000 per year in contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). However, withdrawals from these IRAs made during retirement years are taxable. The tax provisions of the congressional balanced budget plan would create a new kind of IRA, known as a super IRA. Contributions to a super IRA would be taxable; however, withdrawals could be made tax-free. As Bruce Bartlett, an economist at the National Center for Policy Analysis, notes, "If the tax rate is the same at the time of deposit and the time of withdrawal, taxpayers would be indifferent between the two types of IRAs. However, most middle-income workers will face higher tax rates during the years of their retirement, because of the Social Security benefits tax."<sup>8</sup>  Therefore, retired workers will not face the higher tax rates associated with retirement when making withdrawals from super IRAs.<p>The <a href="fyi_79.gif">table</a> below shows the advantage of the congressional super-IRA provision. Suppose a young worker decides to invest $500 annually in a conventional IRA. Because these annual contributions are tax-exempt under current law, this worker can dedicate the entire $500 in personal savings. After 40 years of $500 annual contributions, this worker's IRA will have accumulated $129,528 in future dollars. However, under current law, this worker must pay taxes on withdrawals from the IRA. If this now-retired worker faces a base marginal tax rate of 15 percent and the surtax of 7.5 percent, he will pay 22.5 percent of the accumulated $129,528 in taxes, leaving him with an after-tax income of $100,384 in future dollars.
<p>
Now suppose this same worker was able to invest the $500 per year in a super IRA. This worker, facing a marginal tax rate of 15 percent, would be able to dedicate only $425 to the IRA because contributions to super IRAs are not tax-free. Every year he would pay $75 in taxes and deposit $425 in the super IRA. After 40 years of $425 annual contributions, this worker's super IRA will have accumulated $110,099. However, this entire amount can be withdrawn tax-free. Thus, by investing in a super IRA he will have $9,715 more after 40 years in after-tax income for his retirement years. This additional future income is equal to $3,070 in today's dollars.
<p>
<b>Extra Potential Retirement Savings from $500-per-Child Tax Credit.</b> The $500-per-child tax credit included in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would benefit 28 million families raising some 51 million children. A 25-year-old couple that has just had a child and decides to dedicate the entire $500-per-child tax credit every year for 18 years to savings for their retirement, and then leaves the balance to continue earning interest for an additional 22 years, could accumulate $41,150 in today's dollars ($101,820 in future dollars) after the 40 years of savings.<sup>9</sup><p>This additional savings amounts to:<p><ul><li>The total amount an average retired couple will spend on groceries over ten years of retirement, or<li>The total amount an average retired homeowner will spend on mortgage payments, property taxes, and home maintenance costs over ten years of retirement.<sup>10</sup></ul><p><b>Extra Potential Retirement Income from Lower Home-Mortgage Rates.</b> The economic simulation conducted by analysts at The Heritage Foundation indicates that households and businesses would face lower interest rates as a result of a stronger economy spurred by a balanced budget and tax relief. Specifically, the simulation projects mortgage interest rates in 2002 will be 0.4 percent below what they are expected to be under current law. This 0.4 percentage point decrease below baseline means that a new home borrower of $100,000 will save $25 per month in mortgage payments.
<p>
A homeowner who chooses to dedicate the extra $25 per month to retirement savings for every month over the 30-year life of the mortgage, and then leaves the balance to continue earning interest for an additional ten years, will accumulate $33,890 in today's dollars ($80,440 in future dollars) after the 40 years of savings.<sup>11</sup> <p>This additional savings amounts to:
<p><ul>
<li>The total amount an average senior citizen will spend on utility payments over 15 years of retirement,
<p>
<li>The total amount an average senior couple will spend on dining away from home over 20 years of retirement, or
<p>
<li>The total amount an average senior couple will spend on gasoline and motor oil over ten years of retirement plus a modest vacation every year for ten years.<sup>12</sup></ul><p><b>Technical Assumptions</b><p>For assumptions that underlie the econometric simulation of the congressional balanced budget legislation, see William W. Beach and John S. Barry, <a href="fyi69.html">"What a Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to the Economy</a>," Heritage Foundation <i>F.Y.I.</i> No. 69, November 14, 1995.
<p>
For calculations of accumulated savings from the $500-per-child tax credit, it was assumed that the entire $500 was contributed to a super-IRA (as defined by the Congressional Budget Resolution of 1995) earning an annual rate of return of 8 percent. It was further assumed that this accumulated amount was saved for an additional 22 years at an annual rate of return of 8 percent. Inflation was assumed to be 3 percent annually.
<p>
The 0.4 percent decline in mortgage interest rates was projected in the above-cited econometric simulation. It was assumed that the savings from this decline were placed in a super-IRA (as defined by the Congressional Budget Resolution of 1995) earning an annual rate of return of 8 percent. Contributions to the IRA were made over the life of a 30-year mortgage. It was further assumed that this accumulated amount was saved for an additional 10 years at an annual rate of return of 8 percent. Inflation was assumed to be 3 percent annually.
<p>
Middle-income seniors typically face a higher tax rate because of the Social Security surtax on "provisional income."<sup>13</sup>  The effect of this surtax is to place America's middle-income elderly in a special, higher bracket by virtue of their age. For instance, if an individual younger than the retirement age receives $1 from savings, the income tax will take 15 cents in the lowest tax bracket. But some Americans must also pay the Social Security surtax, and a second 7.5 cents on the same $1 of savings could be due under the surtax.

CLINTON'S $300-PER-CHILD TAX CUT PLAN
DENIES TAX RELIEF TO 23 MILLION CHILDREN</h3>

December 11, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%><br>

<bq><i> Now, what the Congress wants to do is to roll back that working family's [Earned Income Tax Credit], in a way that will impose a tax increase averaging $500 a family on families least able to pay it.  This is a tax hike that literally will push many working families back into poverty.<br>
 President Bill Clinton, October 7, 1995</i></bq></center>

<P>
	The White House charged in October that Congress's balanced budget and tax cut plan would raise taxes on families earning below $30,000, because of the proposed congressional reforms in the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Yet a comparison of President Clinton's just-released budget (with its provision for a $300-per-child tax credit for dependent children below age 13 in families with annual incomes below $75,000<sup>1</sup>) and the Balanced Budget Act vetoed by Clinton on Wednesday (with its $500-per-child tax cut for all children in families earning up to $110,000<sup>2</sup>) shows that the congressional plan would benefit 5.4 million more low-income working families with children than the Clinton plan. This is so even after accounting for the changes in the EITC in the Balanced Budget Act. The group especially hit under the Clinton budget are many families with children earning below $24,000 per year, who would be denied the $300 child credit under the Clinton plan (receiving only the EITC) and who would be eligible for both the $500 child credit and the EITC under the congressional plan.
<p>
	Overall, the $500-per-child tax credit in Congress's balanced budget and tax cut plan would benefit 23 million more children than the Administration's $300-per-child credit. Congress's plan would give tax relief to 10.4 million families with children who would receive no tax relief under the Clinton plan. In addition, there would be millions of families in which at least one sibling would receive tax relief under Clinton but other siblings would not. Taken together, the total number of children not qualifying for any tax relief under Clinton would be 23 million less than under Congress's plan. These children would receive $15.4 billion in tax relief under Congress's plan but nothing under Clinton's plan.
<p>
	There are three major reasons why the Clinton tax cut plan ends up denying tax relief to so many families with children:


<p>
<b>Reason #1: Clinton's tax cut only benefits families with children under age 13.</b>  Since roughly 25 percent of all children are over age 12, millions of families are denied a tax cut just when the cost of raising that child becomes more expensive. This provision alone denies tax relief to the families of at least 2.8 million children earning under $30,000 per year. This restriction also reduces the average tax cut per family because many families have children below age 13 and children age 13 or older. Indeed, the average tax cut per family under the Clinton plan is $442, but the average tax cut under Congress's plan is $856 per family.
<p>
<b>Reason #2: Clinton's tax cut only benefits families earning up to $75,000 per year.</b> While some 88 percent of all children live in families earning below $75,000 per year, this income restriction denies $2.6 billion in tax relief to nearly 6 million families with children, compared with Congress's plan. Many of these families would by no means consider themselves "rich." For example, a federal worker earning $40,000 per year and his school teacher spouse earning $35,000 could easily find themselves denied tax relief under the Clinton plan.  
<p>
<b>Reason #3: The Clinton plan requires low-income families to deduct their EITC benefits from their income tax bill before they can take the $300-per-child tax credit.</b> By contrast, Congress's plan allows a low-income family to take the $500-per-child tax credit first, and then receive the full measure of the EITC on top of the child credit. As the following table shows, as a result of this difference in which the tax credit is taken versus the EITC, a family with two children would have to earn $24,000 annually before becoming eligible for the Clinton credit. By contrast, under the Balanced Budget Act this family would become eligible for the credit at roughly $17,000 in annual income.
<p><bq>




<b>Example:</b> Say a married couple with two children earning $23,000 per year pays $908 in income taxes. To calculate how much of a tax cut they would receive under the Clinton plan, this family must first deduct roughly $1,170 in EITC benefits from their $908 income tax bill, which results in zero available income taxes from which to deduct the $600 tax credit they might otherwise be eligible to receive. However, under Congress's $500-per-child tax credit plan, this family would first take a tax deduction of $908 (although their two children would otherwise give them $1,000 tax credit, the value of the tax deduction cannot exceed their income tax liability). Then they would receive, in addition, their full $1,170 in EITC benefits ($1,514 after the congressional reforms).
</bq><p>
See Chart 1: <a href="fyi78_2.gif">Tax Savings: Married Couple with Two Children</a>
<p> 
	Combined, these three elements of the Clinton plan make it substantially inferior to Congress's $500-per-child tax credit, even considering the reforms in the EITC. Specifically:
<p><ul>
<li>Clinton's $300-per-child tax credit plan would benefit 23 million fewer children, than Congress's $500-per-child tax credit plan. Some 10.4 million families would get no tax relief under Clinton but would under Congress's plan. Millions of other families would receive reduced tax relief because some of their children would qualify under Congress's plan but not under Clinton's. Taken together, these families would be denied $15 billion per year in tax cuts.
<p>
<li>Compared with Congress's $500-per-child tax cut plan, the Clinton plan would deny tax relief to 5.4 million children in families earning below $30,000 per year in income. Under Congress's plan, these same families would receive $2.3 billion in tax cuts.
<p>
<li>Under the Clinton plan, a single parent with one child would have to earn over $18,500 per year to become eligible for the $300-per-child tax cut. Under Congress's plan, this parent would begin getting tax relief with just over $11,500 in annual income. See Chart 2: <a href="fyi78_3.gif">Tax Savings: Single Parent with One Child</a>.
<p>
<li>Under the Clinton plan, a married couple with two children would have to make $24,000 per year to become eligible for the $300-per-child tax cut. Under Congress's plan, this family would begin getting tax relief at $17,000 in annual income.
See Table 1: <a href="fyi78_1.gif">Income at Which Family Becomes Eligible for Tax Cut</a><p></ul><p>
Even after accounting for reforms in the Earned Income Tax Credit, families with two children earning below $30,000 per year would, on average, receive $132 more each year in tax cuts than under the Clinton plan. Single parents with one child earning below $30,000 annually would receive $187 more tax relief on average than under the Clinton plan. Even this assumes that both of these families have children under age 13 (and thus eligible for the Clinton credit). Since 25 percent of all children are above the age of 12, many of these families would receive far less tax relief on average under the Clinton plan. Congress's plan gives an average of $856 in tax relief per family, whereas the Clinton plan gives an average of $442 per family.
<p>
<b>Endnotes:</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>The Administration's $300 per-child credit begins phasing out for families with incomes above $60,000 and reaches zero at $75,000 in family income. The credit increases in value to $500 per child after 1998.

<li>For taxpayers filing jointly with incomes above $110,000 the credit phases out at a rate of $25 for each $1,000 above the threshold (a range of $20,000), thus fully phasing out at $130,000 in income. For families with two children, the two credits this family is eligible for are fully phased out at $150,000 in income. For single filers, the credit begins to phase out at $75,000 in income.

<bq><i>
"If you take the $500 a year tax credit, and I figure, you know,
$5 for a bottle of wine, that is 100 bottles of wine for a family...."<sup>1</sup></i><br> Congressman Jim McDermott (D-WA)<br></center></bq><p>	Contrary to what elitists in Washington would have the public believe, for most hard-working American families raising children a $500 tax cut for each child is not an insignificant amount of money. This is especially true as many families no doubt are wondering how they will be able to afford the $432 some surveys report each household expects to spend this holiday season.<sup>2</sup> Yet the families of 51 million children, or over 28 million families in all, were denied relief from their financial worries when President Bill Clinton recently vetoed Congress's seven year balanced budget and tax cut plan, which had as its centerpiece a $500-per-child tax credit. This tax cut would pump over $22 billion per year into family budgets across the country so that working parents can provide for their children in a way no government program can.
<p>
	As congressional Republicans negotiate with the White House on a compromise plan to balance the budget by 2002 and provide tax cuts, they should resist pressure to scale back the $500-per-child tax credit as a price for cutting a deal. Those who argue that Washington cannot "afford" such generous tax cuts while the government is trying to balance the budget are, in effect, arguing for higher spending. The budget will not be balanced any faster if the amount of the per-child credit is reduced below $500 or if the income for which families are eligible is lowered from its current level of $110,000 for joint filers.<sup>3</sup> Any money not put back in the checkbooks of working families with children through tax cuts, is more money in the checkbook for politicians and bureaucrats to spend while the budget is moving toward balance.
<p>
	Congressional and White House negotiators should keep in mind that for parents with two children, the $1,000 tax cut they would receive under this plan could mean the difference between paying the mortgage and not. Indeed, as the table below shows, a $1,000 tax cut for the typical family with two children is enough to pay one month's mortgage and grocery bills, or 11 months worth of electric bills, or nearly 20 months worth of clothing for the children. In other words, a $1,000 tax cut is a significant amount of money for most families' household budgets. 

<p>
	There are also sound policy reasons to cut taxes for families with children:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Families with children are overtaxed.</b> In 1948, the average American family with children paid only 3 percent of its income to Uncle Sam. Today the same family pays 24.5 percent.
<p>
<li><b>Giving a family of four a $500-per-child tax credit is equivalent to giving them one month's mortgage payment.</b> The average family now loses $10,060 per year of its income due to the 45-year increase in federal taxes as a share of family income. This tax loss exceeds the annual mortgage payment on the average family home. The $1,000 in tax relief the congressional tax-cut plan would give to a family with two children would help this family pay one month's mortgage payment.
<p>
<li><b>Millions of families stand to benefit.</b> The families of 51 million American children, or 28 million taxpaying families, are eligible for the $500-per-child tax cut. 
<p>
<li><b>Family tax relief helps families in every state. </b>The typical congressional district has some 117,000 children in families eligible for a $500 tax credit. Thus families in the typical district would receive $54 million per year in tax relief.
<p>
<li><b>Congress's $500-per-child tax credit would eliminate the entire income tax burden for 3.5 million taxpayers caring for 8.7 million children.</b> These 3.5 million families will receive over $2.2 billion per year in tax relief. Families with two children earning up to $24,000 per year would see their entire income tax burden eliminated by a $500-per-child tax credit, and families with three children earning up to $26,000 also would have their income tax bill eliminated.
<p>
<li><b>Most families are middle-class.</b> The $500 child credit plan will direct 89 percent of all benefits to families with adjusted gross incomes below $75,000 per year --  middle-income by any standard --  and over 96 percent to families with incomes below $100,000.
<p>
<li><b>Cutting taxes for all families --  regardless of income --  is fair.</b> Congress's plan will cut    the income tax burden of a family of four earning $30,000 per year by 51 percent and the income tax burden of a family earning $40,000 per year by 30 percent. Meanwhile, a family of four earning $75,000 would see their tax burden reduced by 12 percent, and a family earning $100,000 per year would receive a tax cut of just 7.4 percent.


</ul><P>
















<center><b>TECHNICAL NOTES ON TABLES</b></center>
<P>
	The following tables represent the best available means of estimating the amount of family tax relief that will go to each state and congressional district from a $500-per-child tax credit. It should be noted that not every eligible family will be able to subtract the full $500 for each child from its tax bill. We have tried to take the following exceptions into account:
<p><ul>
<li><b>The $500 credit is non-refundable.</b>This means that a family cannot get more in tax relief than it pays in income taxes. Example: a family of four earning $20,000 per year owes about $458 in income taxes. Though the $500-per-child tax credit might otherwise get them $1,000 in total tax relief because of their two children, the fact that this credit is not refundable allows them to deduct only what they owe  $458  from their income tax bill.

<li><b>The $500 credit is phased out for joint filers with incomes above $110,000 per year and single filers with incomes above $75,000 per year.</b> For taxpayers filing jointly with incomes above $110,000 the credit phases out at a rate of $25 for each $1,000 above the threshold (a range of $20,000), thus fully phasing out at $130,000 in income. For families with two children, the two credits this family is eligible for are fully phased out at $150,000 in income. For single filers, the credit begins to phase out at $75,000 in income and is fully phased out at $95,000 in income.
</ul><p>
	The first two tables, showing the number of households and children by state, were calculated using the 1991 IRS Public Use File.  This data is derived from income tax return forms and the number of dependents claimed on those forms.
<P>
	The tables listing family tax relief by congressional district were calculated using the 1990 Census.
<p>
	Because the sources for the two tables are different, the tax relief calculated for each state will not necessarily equal the sum of tax relief for that state's individual counties. In each case, the source is the most accurate data available for that specific level of analysis.  The differences may be caused by the following facts:
<p><ol>
<li>The IRS data are based on tax returns filed with the federal government.  Not every household files a tax return, however.  For some groups this is by law; Native Americans are not required to file a tax return.  Other individuals do not file because they do not have an income to report.  Finally, some people simply do not file for personal reasons.  These same groups may be counted by the Census Bureau but will not be accounted for by the IRS.

<li>Many people maintain a permanent residence in one county or state but live in another.  These people pay taxes in a different county or state  than where they live.  Again the Census and IRS will account for these people in different locations.

<li>Many people file their tax returns late.  Thus, the data from the 1991 IRS files may not include certain families that would be included in the Census count. Alternatively, the IRS records may include more families (because of people filing from past years) than the Census Bureau count

<title>What A Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean for Family College Costs -- Heritage</title>

<h3><i>BALANCED BUDGET TALKING POINTS #3:  
WHAT A BALANCED FEDERAL BUDGET WITH TAX CUTS 
WOULD MEAN FOR FAMILY COLLEGE COSTS</i></h3>

<a href="/heritage/staff/barry.html">John S. Barry</a><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 77<br>
December 4, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
Congress's balanced budget with tax relief legislation will allow families with children to save more money for higher education. A balanced budget with tax cuts also will lead to lower interest rates which will benefit students by lowering the cost of student loans. Both of these consequences of balancing the budget over seven years with tax relief mean more highly skilled Americans for future workforces. These are the findings of an analysis by The Heritage Foundation using one of the principal econometric models of the U.S. economy. 
<p>
According to this statistical analysis, the Balanced Budget Act developed by Congress would mean: 
<p><ul>
<li> American families, over time, could save an additional $14,066 per child in today's dollars to fund college education costs as a result of the $500-per-child tax credit. This would cover the full tuition costs at a typical public university today.
<p>
<li> An average student could save more than $414 over the life of a 10-year student loan as a result of lower interest rates.
</ul><p>
Economists at The Heritage Foundation conducted an interim econometric analysis of the congressional balanced budget plan using the economic model developed by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, a nationally recognized economic consulting firm.<sup>1</sup>  The Meyer model is used by many major public agencies and private firms, such as the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the Office of Management and Budget, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and the Congressional Budget Office.<sup>2</sup><p><b>INCREASED FAMILY SAVINGS FROM $500-PER-CHILD TAX CREDIT</b><p>The high cost of a college education prices many families out of the higher education market or forces students and parents to incur large amounts of debt to cover the costs of college.<p>The $500-per-child tax credit included in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would benefit more than 28 million families raising some 51 million children and could allow many families to save enough money to send their children to college. A family that chooses to dedicate the entire $500-per-child tax credit to savings for higher education would accumulate about $14,066 in today's dollars over 18 years for each child's education. Thus, a family with two children would be able to save an additional $28,132 for college expenses. In today's dollars, an additional $14,066 per child in family savings for education amounts to:
<p><ul>
<li> Five full years' tuition and fees at an average public university; 
<p>
<li> One full year's tuition and fees at an average private university; or
<p>
<li> More than the difference between the four-year cost of an average public university and the two-year cost of an average public community college.
</ul>
<p>
<b>LOWER STUDENT LOAN INTEREST RATES</b>
<p>
The economic simulation conducted by analysts at The Heritage Foundation indicates that households and businesses would face lower interest rates under the congressional balanced budget and tax cut plan than under current budget and tax policy. Lower interest rates also would benefit students with student loans. A student beginning his or her education in 1996 would face interest rates that averaged half a percentage point below what is expected under current law:  a savings of $414 over the life of an average ten-year student loan.<sup>3</sup>  More young Americans will be able to afford a college education as a result of these savings. In addition, some students who otherwise would have to defer their education plans could enter college earlier, thus increasing their lifetime earnings.
<p>
Alternatively, lower interest rates would allow students to borrow more money for education at the same effective cost. In essence, students would be able to purchase more education for the same price. The additional $414 might be used for such things as:
<p>
<ul>
<li> One full year of books and supplies;

<li> Two additional courses at an average public university; or

<li> About one-third the cost of a personal computer. 
</ul><p>

<b>TECHNICAL ASSUMPTIONS</b>
<p>
For assumptions that underlie the econometric simulation of the congressional balanced budget legislation, see William W. Beach and John S. Barry, "What a Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to the Economy," Heritage Foundation <i>F.Y.I.</i> No. 69, November 14, 1995.
<p>
For purposes of calculating the amount of savings from a $500-per-child tax credit, it was assumed that the money was placed in a super-IRA (as defined by the Congressional Budget Resolution of 1995) earning a real rate of return of 5 percent per year.
<p>
The initial rate of interest charged for a student loan was assumed to be 8.25 percent. The 0.5 percent figure is an average decrease below baseline for the life of a ten-year student loan. This 0.5 percent decrease was projected in the above-cited econometric simulation.

<p>
<li>Laurence H. Meyer & Associates long has earned top honors for forecasting accuracy when compared against similar firms. In 1993, it won the "Blue Chip" forecasting award for the years 1989-1992. Laurence H. Meyer & Associates was ineligible for the award in 1994, but again was rated the most accurate forecasting firm in the United States.
<p>
<li>This is based on a student loan of $13,044, the average cost of a public university, at an initial interest rate of 8.25 percent. The Heritage Foundation econometric analysis assumes that the Federal Reserve System makes no change in the reserve requirements of its member banks and refrains from stimulating the economy by increasing the growth of monetary reserves. This assumption means a relatively smaller decrease in interest rates. Thus, the 0.5 percent decrease can be viewed as a conservative estimate of the potential savings to a student from lower interest rates.

<title>Who Will Benefit From Cuts in Capital Gains Taxes -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3><i>BALANCED BUDGET TALKING POINTS #2:
WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM CUTS IN CAPITAL GAINS TAXES?</i></h3>

<a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William W. Beach</a><br>
Visiting Fellow in Tax Analysis<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 76<br>
December 4, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>

The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 contains important changes in capital gains tax policy. Specifically, the bill lowers the effective tax rate by 50 percent for individual tax filers through a deduction for half of net taxable gain. Thus, an individual in the 28 percent tax bracket would see his effective tax rate on gains drop to 14 percent. For corporations, the bill decreases the capital gains tax rate from a maximum of 35 percent to 28 percent. Both changes are effective after December 31, 1994.<sup>1</sup><p>Proponents of these tax policy changes argue that lower capital gains tax rates will stimulate economic growth, improve the fairness of the tax code, and increase federal revenue from the capital gains tax by encouraging individuals to "unlock" gains that they have been unwilling to realize at the currently high tax rate. Critics of these changes argue that lower effective tax rates on capital gains disproportionately benefit wealthy Americans, thus rendering the federal tax system more unfair. The critics also suggest that the "economic stimulus" produced by the reduction in rates will improve principally the fortunes of the owners of capital, not the incomes of other Americans.<sup>2</sup> <p>The work of most economists who have analyzed capital gains taxes and publicly available government data on who pays these taxes all indicate that the proponents are right and the critics are wrong. There are three major reasons why adopting capital gains tax changes as defined in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 will benefit nearly every American.
<p>
<B>First</B>, the benefits of cutting capital gains taxes go mostly to lower and middle income taxpayers rather than to the wealthy. When critics claim that capital gains go mainly to the wealthy, they mislead the public by including the gain when citing a person's income. In this way, a retiree living on a $12,000 Social Security check who realizes a $30,000 capital gain one year on the sale of his house is classified as a "person with a $42,000 income who receives a capital gain." 
<p>
Contrary to what opponents suggest about who will benefit from these tax cuts, the typical household declaring a capital gain had income from sources <i>other than capital gains</i> of $58,729 in 1991.<sup>3</sup>  The typical capital gain for this household was $973. About 11 percent of all taxpaying households declared a capital gain in 1991.
<p>
About 19 percent of taxpaying households with capital gains in 1991 contained more than one child. These households had an average income of $87,448 and an average capital gain of $1,178. 
<p>
Another 27 percent of taxpaying households with capital gains contained taxpayers over the age of 65 or blind. These taxpayers had an average income of $43,637 and an average capital gain of $2,151. It is particularly important that households containing children and elderly taxpayers be able to liquidate appreciated assets and realize as much after-tax income as possible if they are to pay for increasingly expensive educational and medical services.
<p>
As Table 1 shows, half of all capital gains were earned by households with incomes from other sources under $100,000, which also accounted for 52 percent of all non-capital gain income. 
<p>
<B>Second</B>, economists who have analyzed the economic effects of balancing the federal budget while simultaneously cutting taxes (including the capital gains tax) have all concluded that these policy changes result in widespread economic benefits through a stronger, more productive economy. One of the nation's most independent and celebrated models of the U.S. economy, the University of Michigan's Quarterly Model, found that balancing the budget with tax cuts produced immediate reductions in interest rates and inflation and higher long-term economic activity.<sup>4</sup>  Each of this country's leading private economic consulting firms (DRI/McGraw-Hill, Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, and Laurence H. Meyer & Associates) recently predicted that balancing the budget with these tax cuts would lead to a much stronger economy with higher wages and more spendable household income.<sup>5</sup><p>The Heritage Foundation recently used the U.S. Macroeconomic Model developed and maintained by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates to determine the economic impact of the balanced budget plan.<sup>6</sup>  While this analysis found that the entire package of budget and tax cuts should result in generally higher economic activity, it also found that most of the economic benefits of the balanced budget plan disappear without cuts in capital gains taxes.
<p>
A Heritage simulation of the U.S. Macroeconomic Model that contained all of the spending and tax cuts for the period 1996 through 2002, except those for capital gains taxes, would result in consistently lower Gross Domestic Product in each of these seven years when compared with a simulation that included cuts in capital gains taxes. A little more than $80.2 billion in potential GDP is lost over seven years without capital gains tax relief.
<p>
According to the same simulation, in addition to lower GDP, the absence of cuts in capital gains taxes would lead to higher unemployment rates and slower household income growth. 
<p>
Critics of the bill should note that without the stimulus to new business activity provided by the capital gains tax cut, the other changes in tax policy are simply not great enough to offset the economic effects of reductions in the rate of government spending leading to a balanced federal budget.
<p>
<B>Third</B>, reducing the tax rate for capital gains actually would increase tax revenues from taxpayers who own most of the appreciated assets. Experience over the last 25 years with changes in capital gains tax rates strongly indicates that rate decreases produce more declarations of capital gains and more capital gains taxes. Owners of appreciated assets who face high tax rates generally hold on to their assets in anticipation of lower future rates. When the rates come down, the amount of capital gains goes up.
<p>
Economists estimate that trillions of dollars in unrealized capital gains (perhaps has high as $7.5 trillion) exist in the portfolios of American taxpayers.<sup>7</sup>  Some economists have estimated that significant capital gains rate changes could produce substantial economic benefits and create revenue windfalls for federal and state governments. Many politicians agree. In an article last year for the <i>American Economic Review</i>, Leonard Burman and William Randolph, the two leading tax economists on the staff of the Congressional Budget Office, estimated the response of taxpayers to rate reductions as being on the order of 6 to 1. That is, for every one percent drop in the rate, capital gains realizations would rise by 6 percent.<sup>8</sup><p>Who would pay most of the additional capital gains taxes?  As Table 1 shows, these new government revenues would come principally from taxpayers with incomes above $200,000. If, indeed, the federal government wants to draw more tax revenue from wealthy Americans, lowering the capital gains tax rate is one of the most effective ways possible to attain this objective.
<P>

<b>Technical Assumptions</b>
<p>
The data about average incomes and capital gains declarations contained in this paper come from the IRS's Public Use File for 1991. This file contains about 115,000 composite tax returns that the IRS has constructed to reflect all 114 million returns filed in 1991. When these returns are multiplied by their statistical weights, the resulting number equals the total national number for a particular tax variable, e.g. capital gains declarations.
<p>
The income numbers contained in this paper were constructed by subtracting all capital gains declarations from adjusted gross income. What remains as income after this subtraction are such things as wages, interest and dividend payments, proprietorship and partnership income, and tax refunds from the previous tax year.

<a href="fyi69c1.gif">Chart 1</a>: Real Gross Domestic Product, Current Law vs. Balanced Budget<br>
<a href="fyi69c2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Additional Non-Residential Fixed Investment From A Balanced Budget<br><p>


Congress's balanced budget plan with tax cuts will lead over the next seven years to greater business investment, higher earnings per hour, and faster economic growth than under current law. The following are the findings of an analysis by <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> using one of the principal econometric models of the U.S. economy. According to the model, the balanced budget plan with tax relief would mean:
<p><ul>
<li>An additional $32.1 billion in real disposable income over the period 1995 through 2002.
<p>
<li>An additional $66.2 billion in consumption expenditures over the period 1995 through 2002.
<p>
<li>An additional $88.2 billion in real non-residential fixed investment over the period 1995 through 2002. 
<p>
<li>An additional 103,700 housing starts over the period 1995 through 2002.
<p></ul>
The analysis is important because many critics of the budget plan have expressed the concern that slowing the growth of federal spending to balance the budget in seven years will cause an economic downturn, if not a recession. Many supporters of the plan, on the other hand, claim that a balanced budget will reduce interest rates and spur productive, private-sector investment and economic activity. The Heritage analysis indicates the supporters are correct.
<p>
Economists at The Heritage Foundation conducted an interim econometric analysis of the plan using the econometric model developed by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates. The analysis is based on the Congressional Budget Resolution, as passed by Congress in May, which forms the overall structure of budget legislation now moving through Congress, and the Senate Finance Committee's description of tax policy changes.1  The Meyer model was used to gauge the general effects that key components of the budget would have on the economy. The Heritage Foundation's simulation of the budget plan strongly indicates that the general trend of economic activity will improve significantly during the "glide path" to a balanced budget as compared with a baseline of continued deficits under current law.
<p>
Laurence H. Meyer & Associates is a nationally recognized economic consulting firm. The Meyer model is used by many major public agencies and private firms. Among them:  the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the Office of Management and Budget, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Congressional Budget Office, the National Association of Realtors, the National Association of Home Builders, and the Ford Motor Company.2 
<p>

<b>The Baseline Projection</b>
<p>
Heritage used projections of economic activity under current budget and tax policy prepared by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates as the economic baseline against which the Congress's budget and tax plan is compared. This baseline forecast (dated August 1995) projects that under current law the federal deficit continuously worsens during the projection period, from a fiscal year 1995 level of $162.1 billion to a fiscal year 2002 level of $257.4 billion. According to the baseline forecast and projection, the average annual growth in inflation-adjusted gross domestic product associated with these continuing deficits is 2.48 percent.3
<p>

<b>The Balanced Budget Simulation</b>
<p>
To conduct the simulation of the congressional budget plan, Heritage economists adjusted only those elements of the Meyer baseline that deal with federal spending and federal tax policy. The spending levels embodied in the Congressional Balanced Budget Resolution were introduced into the model in such a way that the resulting simulation mirrored the priorities defined in the resolution. For instance, the growth rates for both Medicare transfers and Medicaid grants were limited to levels called for within the budget resolution. Similarly, welfare spending was limited to a growth rate of 3.5 percent per year after 1997. Increases in national defense spending were applied primarily to Department of Defense procurement programs. And spending decreases in government purchases and transfer payments were assumed until a balanced budget was reached in 2002.4
<p>
With respect to changes in tax policy, the model was adjusted to reflect the new average tax rates that individuals and businesses would face if Congress enacted the changes in tax deductions and allowances defined by the Senate Finance Committee in the Chairman's Mark of October 16, 1995. Heritage calculated the changes in average effective federal tax rates that would result from adoption of family tax relief and various changes in the tax treatment of IRAs, health care costs, and estate taxes. These tax policy changes were used to adjust the model's average rate for individuals. Also incorporated were proposed changes in the taxation of individual and corporate capital gains, principally the exclusion of 50 percent of capital gains for individuals, the capping of the corporate tax rate on capital gains at 28 percent, and other major tax policy changes in the Chairman's Mark that would affect businesses.5
<p>
<a href="fyi69t1.gif">Table 1</a> indicates how balancing the federal budget in seven years while cutting taxes would affect the U.S. economy. Critics of balancing the budget and simultaneously cutting taxes argue that these changes will send the economy into a recession. As <a href="fyi69t1.gif">Table 1</a> shows, the simulation not only results in no such recession, but indicates that the economy would generally grow slightly faster with the proposed budget and tax changes than without them. Over the seven-year forecast horizon, inflation-adjusted gross domestic product grows by $10.8 billion more with these public policy changes than without them, and at no time during this period does the economy become recessionary (see <a href="fyi69c1.gif">Chart 1</a>).
<p>
There appear to be three principal forces behind this growth in economic activity.
<p>
<b>First, the tax cuts add $32.1 billion above baseline to real household disposable income during the period 1995-2002. </b>
<p>
This growth in the real purchasing power of average Americans explains the higher levels of consumption expenditures under the policy of a balanced budget with tax cuts than under the baseline of continuing deficits and high taxes.
<p>
Total real consumption expenditures are above baseline every year after 1996.
<p>
<b>Second, balancing the budget and cutting taxes leads to greater investment in plant and equipment that, in turn, leads to higher levels of productivity (see <a href="fyi69c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). </b>
<p>
The simulation indicates that households and businesses will face lower interest rates under the balanced budget and tax cut plan than under current budget and tax policy.
<p>
For example, the federal funds rate would fall from 5.8 percent in 1995 to 4.1 percent by 2002 in the simulation, which is 0.5 percentage points lower than the baseline. 
<p>
10-year and 30-year government notes would have significantly lower yields by 2002 than in the baseline of continued deficits. 
<p>
The contract rate for first-time mortgages would drop faster under a balanced budget with tax cuts than in the baseline, to 6.1 percent in 2002 rather than 6.5 percent. This means that the budget and tax plan will save a home borrower of $100,000 about $10,000 over the life of a 30-year mortgage.
<p>
All of these downward interest rate movements when combined with lower taxes support higher growth in household and business purchases of durable goods, homes, and factories.
<p>
Total housing starts would be 2.1 percent higher than in the baseline by 2002, according to the simulation.
<p>
Investment in business machinery would be 2.7 percent higher than in the baseline, with the computers component of business durable equipment outgrowing the baseline by 2.3 percent and all other equipment purchases ending 2.9 percent higher in 2002 than in the baseline.
<p>
The increase in capital investment denotes a movement in savings from cash-based accounts to capital-based assets. In other words, households and businesses are increasing their purchases of more productive and longer-term investments. These investments would have several positive effects. In particular: 
<p>
Real compensation per hour for workers would increase faster (and be the same or higher in every year) than the baseline, and industrial production for businesses would be higher. 
<p>
The simulation shows slightly slower growth in GDP than the baseline in 1996. This temporary slower growth is due to reduced federal government purchases. However, the shift in savings from cash-based accounts to capital-based assets generally supports greater economic growth after 1996. The continued purchases of durable goods and equipment by households and businesses more than offsets reductions in government spending.
<p>
<b>Third, the reduction of federal government spending in the private economy leads not only to a stronger macroeconomy, but to one with less inflation.</b>
<p>
Both the Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index would grow more slowly with a balanced budget plan and tax cuts than without them. For example:
<p>
The average growth in the CPI, according to the simulation, would be 1.94 percent per year, while the baseline forecast projects an annual average growth rate of 2.29 percent. 
<p>
It should be noted that the simulation also shows a slightly higher unemployment rate than the baseline in each year after 1995. This slight growth in projected unemployment stems from two factors, one of them a normal feature of economic change and the other based on an assumption about monetary policy.
<p>
First, the reduction in government spending would mean layoffs in the public sector and in firms supplying goods and services to the government. Second, the simulation performed by Heritage assumes that the Federal Reserve System makes no change in the reserve requirements of its member banks and refrains from stimulating the economy by increasing the growth of monetary reserves. This assumption means relatively lower levels of growth in consumption expenditures and employment when compared with a simulation, also performed by Heritage and using the Meyer model, that assumes the Federal Reserve reacts to the slowdown in government spending by easing constraints on banks. It is worth noting that this second simulation (where the Fed stimulates short-term economic activity by expanding the supplies of money and credit) yields unemployment rates that are the same or better than the baseline. The unemployment numbers shown are a worst-case scenario when compared to model simulations which assume a reaction by the central bank.
<p>
This interim analysis of Congress's budget and tax plan may surprise both its supporters and its critics. On the one hand, supporters may have expected the economy to respond to a balanced budget with tax cuts more immediately than the analysis shows. But the plan's supporters should take note that, while these changes over the seven-year forecast period are significant, the major impact of these policy changes occurs not immediately, but steadily -- over the period in which the budget is balanced and thereafter. Further, the tax changes, while significant, are only a small adjustment in today's code. Congress would need to enact major reforms of the code to spur the level of capital formation and growth that proponents of, say, a flat tax predict. If Congress were to make pro-growth reforms in federal tax policy (such as enacting a flat tax), the future pattern of the economy likely would improve much more than it would as the result of the relatively modest tax changes now being considered. 
<p>
Critics of the balanced budget plan, on the other hand, should recognize that the plan generally supports their objective of economic growth at lower interest rates and lower inflation.
<p>
<b>Technical Notes</b>
<p>
The following policy assumptions were accounted for:
<ul><p>
<li>Military spending--90% of the spending increases over the next seven years was applied to the procurement account. The other 10% was applied to Department of Defense civilian employment increases. Zero percent real growth was assumed in 2003 and 2004.
<p>
<li>Agriculture--The $13.4 billion savings from decreased agriculture subsidies called for in the budget resolution was spread over seven years in the following distribution:  1996 ($0.6), 1997 ($1), 1998 ($1.6), 1999 and 2000 ($2), 2001 ($2.6), 2002 ($3.6). A reduction of $3.6 billion was assumed in 2003 and 2004.
<p>
<li>Medicare--Reductions in the rate of growth for Medicare follow those in the budget resolution. A growth rate of 7.63 percent was assumed for 2003 and 2004.
<p>
<li>Welfare--Cash aid welfare spending growth rates were capped at 3.5 percent.
<p>
<li>Foreign aid--Transfer payments to foreigners were decreased according to the reductions called for in the budget resolution for account number 150 (international affairs).
<p>
<li>Medicaid--The growth rate in Medicaid was held to the levels called for in the budget reconciliation:  7.2 percent in 1996, 6.8 in 1997, and 4 percent thereafter.
<p>
<li>Civilian and military compensation per person was held constant after 1998.
<p>
<li>Non-defense federal civilian employment was decreased by 20 percent, spread evenly between 1996 and 2000. 
<p>
<li>All other spending-- for government purchases and transfer payments -- was reduced in the same proportion called for in the budget resolution until balance was reached in 2002.
<p>
<li>Capital gains taxes--A 50 percent exemption of capital gains was assumed for taxation purposes through 2004.
<p>
<li>Family tax relief--Federal receipts from individual income taxes were reduced according to the yearly levels in the Joint Tax Committee's score of the Senate's tax package.
</ul><p>
Other provisions of the Senate tax relief package were accounted for by changing the effective tax rates on wages, dividends, and individuals.

<title>What A Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to the Economy -- Heritage</title>

Presentation to Senate Republican Conference<br>
November 15, 1995<br>

<p>
<a href="#graphs">Graphs and Charts</a>
<p>
Using a generally accepted and widely regarded model of the U.S. economy, we found that balancing the federal budget between 1996 and 2002 while cutting taxes caused the economy generally to grow more than not balancing the budget and cutting taxes.
<p>
<i>Specifically, according to the simulation, the balanced budget plan with tax relief would mean:</i>
<p><ul>
<li>Gross Domestic Product grows by $10.8 billion more than under current law in the year 2002.
<p>
<li>An additional $32.1 billion in real disposable income over the period 1995 through 2002.
<p>
<li>An additional $66.2 billion in consumption expenditures over the period 1995 though 2002.
<p>
<li>An additional $88.2 billion in real non-residential fixed investment over the period 1995 through 2002.
<p>
<li>A decrease of 0.4 percent in the conventional mortgage rate.  This means that a balanced budget with tax relief would save a home borrower of $100,000 about $10,000 over the life of a 30-year mortgage.
<P>
<li>The additional construction of 104,000 new family homes over the next seven years.
<p>
<li>The additional sales of 600,000 automobiles over the next seven years worth $10 billion.
<p>
<li>A decrease of 0.7 percent in the growth rate of the Consumer Price Index.
<p></ul>
	The Heritage Foundation used the U.S. economic model developed by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, a nationally recognized economic consulting company, to reach these conclusions. Laurence H. Meyer & Associates are consultants to many government agencies including the Office of Management & Budget, the Federal Reserve Board, the Department of Labor, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Council of Economic Advisors.
<p>
	Heritage made no changes to the Meyer model except to reset federal spending levels to mirror those contained in the Congressional Budget Resolution of May and to reduce tax rates that capture tax policy changes defined by the Senate Finance Committee.  We explicitly continued the assumption of the Meyer model that the Federal Reserve would not act to stimulate the economy in the face of slower than expected growth.  Had we allowed the model to use the assumption of a more active Federal Reserve, all of the numbers reported below would have been significantly higher.
<p>
Specifically, we assumed:
<p><ul>
<li>Reductions in the rate of growth for Medicare and Medicaid follow those in the budget resolution.
<p>
<li>Cash aid welfare spending growth rates were capped at 3.5 percent.
<P>
<li>Increases in national defense spending were applied primarily to Department of Defense procurement programs.
<p>
<li>All other spending -- for government purchases and transfer payments -- was reduced in the same proportion called for in the budget resolution until balance was reached in 2002.
<p>
<li>A 50 percent exemption of capital gains was assumed through 2004.
<p>
<li>Family tax relief and other provisions of the Senate tax package were accounted for by changing the effective tax rates on wages, dividends, and individuals.

<title>How Congress's $245 Billion Tax Cut Repeals Just One-Third of '90 and '93 Tax Hikes -- Heritage</title>

<b>"I think I raised [your taxes] too much, too."</b><p>
<blockquote>		--President Clinton, October 17, 1995</blockquote>
<p>
<a href="tax-cut2.gif">Chart 1: Tax Cut Only One-Third of Combined 1990 and 1993 Tax Increases</a><br>
<a href="tax-cut1.gif">Chart 2: Government Will Still Get Too Much Revenue After Tax Cut</a><br>
<p>
President Clinton claims that the $245 billion seven-year tax cut supported by Congress is excessive. But it actually does not come close to eliminating the huge tax increase levied by the last Congress and is dwarfed by the level of tax hikes approved since Ronald Reagan left office. (See <a href="tax-cut2.gif">Chart 1</a>) Consider:
<p><ul>
<li> The increased tax burden caused by the 1990 and 1993 tax bills totals three times more than this year's proposed tax cut. Taxpayers will still be worse off compared with their tax burden in 1989. <p>

<li> This year's tax cut will reduce federal tax collections by less than 2.2 cents on the dollar. And that is the "worst-case" estimate that assumes no revenue feedback from higher growth stimulated by such things as the proposed capital gains tax cut.
<p>
<li> Even with the tax cut, tax revenues are projected to rise from $1.357 trillion this year to $1.820 trillion in 2002, an increase of $463 billion (an average of $66 billion per year).
</ul><p>
	By any objective measure, the Administration's claim that the tax cut is too big cannot be justified. Set in proper context, these figures instead make a persuasive case that this year's tax cut should be considered a first step. Indeed, when lawmakers next year begin considering a flat tax, they should take whatever steps are needed -- including further limits on the growth of federal spending -- to ensure that tax reform is accompanied by tax reduction.
<p>
	<b>Undoing Damage from 1990 and 1993 Tax Hikes.</b> According to Congressional Budget Office figures, the 1990 tax increase was projected to increase revenues by 0.54 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). The 1993 tax hike, America's biggest, was projected to raise revenues by a further 0.73 percent of GDP. The tax cut now being discussed, by contrast, is estimated to reduce tax collections by a scant 0.4 percent of GDP. Thus, CBO projections suggest that this comparatively modest tax cut at best will reverse only one-third of the damage inflicted by higher taxes in 1990 and 1993.<P>

	<b>No Revenue Shortfall.</b> As <a href="tax-cut1.gif">Chart 2</a> illustrates, the CBO projects that federal tax collections will expand by more than $460 billion if the tax cuts are enacted. These estimates, incidentally, assume that there is no positive effect on the economy from lowering the tax burden. Needless to say, several measures in the proposal, such as reductions in the tax on capital gains, expansion of Individual Retirement Accounts, and partial relief for those subject to the alternative minimum tax, will boost incentives to save and invest and therefore trigger higher wages for American workers. This increase in taxable income will offset some of the projected $245 billion tax cut.
<p>
	Even with the implausible assumption that the economy receives no benefit from lower taxes, the proposed tax cut will have only a tiny effect on revenues. Tax revenues still are projected by the CBO to rise by an average of $66 billion annually between 1995 and 2002. And of the $11.373 trillion in tax revenue the government is projected to collect over that period, the $245 billion tax cut will reduce that amount by less than 2.2 cents for every dollar.
<P>
	<b>The High-Tax Approach Has Failed.</b> The White House claims that lower taxes will be counterproductive. Before criticizing tax cuts, however, the Administration would be well advised to see how the redistributionist goal of higher taxes has backfired.
Tax rates on the "rich" were raised in 1990 and 1993. The result:  As opponents warned, upper-income taxpayers reduced the amount of income they reported.
<P><ul>
<li> The higher taxes from the "rich" from increased income tax rates in 1990 and 1993 were supposed to help boost total income taxes as a proportion of GDP. The result:  Income tax collections actually have fallen from 8.6 percent of GDP in 1989 to 8.2 percent of GDP in 1994.
<p>
<li> Revenues grew by an average of 6.6 percent annually in the "tax-cutting" Reagan years, a rate of growth one-fourth higher than the 5.3 percent annual revenue increases under Presidents Bush and Clinton.
<p>
<li> The budget deficit was less than $155 billion in 1989 and was projected by the Congressional Budget Office in January 1989 to fall every year into the future if Reagan's policies were left untouched. Lawmakers instead imposed large tax hikes in 1990 and 1993. The result:  The deficit this year is $161 billion and now projected by the CBO to rise in future years.
<p>
<li> The tax increases in 1990 and 1993 were intended to spur the economy. The result:  A recession in 1990-1991 was followed by recovery and expansion well below historical averages for job creation and economic growth.
</ul><p>
	In the last five years, taxpayers have been burdened by two major tax increases. These tax hikes have failed to achieve their economic and income redistribution objectives. The result has been lackluster economic growth and persistent budget deficits. To help reverse this failed approach, Congress is preparing what is, in reality, a modest tax cut. The tax relief is only a fraction of the 1990 and 1993 tax increases, and taxpayers will see their tax bills decline by less than 2.2 percent compared to current law. But the proposed changes are at least a welcome step in the right direction of a tax code that would stimulate the economy.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
Later this month, members of the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee will begin filling in the details of the $245 billion package of tax relief approved in the FY 1996 budget resolution. In addition to finding the savings needed to balance the federal budget by fiscal 2002, the budget resolution requires an additional $75 billion in savings, which combined with the estimated $170 billion "fiscal dividend" produced by the balanced budget plan, is sufficient to finance a substantial package of tax relief to help families with children and to stimulate economic growth.
<p>
Congress must now determine how to allocate a limited pool of $245 billion in tax relief. The committees should begin this process by using the $354 billion House plan as a menu from which to craft a tax relief package. Because the House plan contains roughly $110 billion more tax relief than is now available under the conference agreement, the committees must use some criteria for narrowing their choices. While each of the tax relief proposals in the House-passed plan addresses particular inequities in the tax code or specific weaknesses in the economy, some of the proposals have additional qualities that should make them top priorities for inclusion in the final package.
<p>
The cornerstones of the House-passed plan, which also should form the cornerstones of the new tax relief package, are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>$500 per child tax credit, 

<li>Reduction of the capital gains tax, and 

<li>An IRA-Plus plan. 
</ul><p>
These tax relief proposals have been the core of the House plan because they provide direct tax relief to American families and they would do most to spur economic growth. The other tax cuts in the House plan are far more targeted in their impact on various taxpayers or far more limited in their impact on the economy. To be sure, these other tax cuts are important, but their inclusion in the final tax cut package will rest on the relative merits of each proposal. 
<p>
In the final analysis, however, the answer involves an important and fundamental decision by Congress about who should control spending -- the government or taxpayers. That is why both tax and spending reductions are needed to effectively move control of spending out of Washington and into the hands of ordinary citizens. By including tax relief in this year's budget, Congress is allowing American taxpayers, rather than the government, to keep and spend more of the money they earn.
<p>
<b>Relief for Families.</b> Most important, American families must share in the savings from reduced government spending. Families also are more likely to support such reductions, for example, if they know they can keep $500 for each dependent child. This is especially true as Congress is considering substantial reforms in welfare. For working families earning between $17,000 and $24,000 per year, the $500 per child tax credit (giving a family of four a $1,000 tax cut) will eliminate their entire income tax burden. Indeed, these families would need less government assistance if they did not have to send so much of the money they earn to Washington in taxes. 
<p>
These overtaxed families can also be turned into a powerful constituency for smaller government if Congress directly links the benefits of balancing the budget to family tax relief. The families of 52 million children, or 35 million working families, would be eligible for the $500 per child tax credit. Taking money away from wasteful government programs and placing it in the pockets of working families gives these taxpayers a stake in the budget process and the incentive to stand up to the advocates of big government.
<p>
Overall, the House-passed plan is very "family-friendly," since some 65 percent of all tax relief will go to families or seniors. About 35 percent of the tax relief will benefit the business or investment communities, contributing to economic growth through job creation. Some of the tax relief targeted to "business," such as reductions in estate and gift taxes, also will benefit owners of family businesses and farms. As they craft a new tax relief plan, the House and Senate committees would be wise to maintain the "family-friendly" nature of the House plan by keeping the relative ratio of tax relief targeted to families and to economic growth and businesses.
<p>
Other tax relief proposals contained in the House-passed plan would improve the fairness of the tax system for senior citizens and businesses, too. For instance, seniors will be more likely to accept Medicare reforms if they no longer have to pay today's surtax on their Social Security benefits; and businesses will be more likely to accept losses in corporate welfare programs if they know the tax code will not punish them for capital investments and risk-taking.
<p>
<b>Relieving the Pressure on Spending.</b> Members should also keep in mind that certain tax relief can change the behavior of some taxpaying groups in ways that ultimately reduce federal outlays for specific programs. Two examples in the House-passed plan are the tax credits for adoption and the improved tax treatment of long-term health care expenditures. Studies show that in many states, putting one child in foster care can cost taxpayers $10,000 to $30,000 per year. This cost could be reduced substantially to the extent that the adoption credit encourages more families to adopt foster children. Similarly, Medicaid's nursing home costs are exploding as many seniors are "divesting" themselves of their assets in order to become eligible for this taxpayer financed program. These public costs could be substantially reduced by the improved tax treatment of long-term care insurance and out-of-pocket expenses.
<p>
Members of Congress should understand how different elements of tax relief benefit their states. Many Members opposing tax relief choose to look only at the impact of reduced federal spending on their states or districts. They forget that if Washington does not spend the money, families will have more to buy necessities for their children, seniors will have more to pay for their own medical services, and businesses will have more to invest in their workers. While this private spending is not as politically visible as unveiling a new pork-barrel project, it does far more to improve the lives of citizens back home. 
<p>
The <a href="/heritage/">Heritage Foundation</a> has estimated the benefits of some of these tax relief proposals -- in some cases, as much as $10 billion to $20 billion over seven years -- for each state (see Appendix). Taxpayers do not need more government spending or new social programs to improve their well-being. Shifting the resources from Washington bureaucrats to families, seniors, and businesses should be viewed as a prudent way to reduce future government spending and encourage work saving and investment.
<p>
As Members negotiate over how to allocate the $245 billion in agreed-upon tax relief, they must remember the importance of putting families first. Working families have borne the largest burden for the rampant growth of government spending and stand to feel the greatest pinch as the rate of spending declines. Furthermore, family incomes have been declining since 1989 thanks to large tax increases imposed on them in 1990 and 1993.
<p>

<b>FAMILY TAX RELIEF</b>
<p>
	The House-passed balanced budget plan contains a substantial package of "family-friendly" tax cuts, including a $500 per child tax credit, expanded Individual Retirement Accounts, and tax credits for families who adopt and those caring for elderly relatives. Over seven years, these family tax cut provisions total $184 billion, comprising 50 percent of the overall tax cut plan. Families, especially families with children, will benefit more than any other group of taxpayers from cutting more wasteful government spending. 
<p>

<b>#1) $500 per Child Tax Credit</b>
<p>
The centerpiece of the Republican Contract with America and the centerpiece of the House-passed plan is a $500 per child tax credit benefiting 35 million working families raising some 52 million children. Such tax relief for working families is long overdue. In 1948, the average American family with two children paid only 3 percent of its income to the federal government in taxes. Today the same family pays 24.5 percent. The family income lost in taxes over the past 45 years exceeds the annual mortgage payment on the average family home. Giving the typical family of four a $500 per child tax credit is equivalent to giving them one month's mortgage payment.
<p>
The House plan's $500 per child credit is "non-refundable," meaning the total value of the credit may not exceed a family's income tax bill. But it does provide uniform tax relief to all families with up to $200,000 per year in income, thereby reducing a low-income family's tax burden by a much greater proportion than an upper-income family's. 
<p>
Example:  A $500 per child tax credit would eliminate the entire federal income tax liability for families of four earning between $17,000 and $24,000 per year; cut by 50 percent the income tax burden of a family earning $30,000 per year; and cut by 30 percent the income tax burden of a family earning $40,000 per year. Meanwhile, the same credit would reduce the income tax burden of a family earning $100,000 per year by only 6.8 percent and the income tax burden of a family earning $200,000 per year by just 2.6 percent.
<p>
Based on Census Bureau data, Heritage Foundation analysts have calculated that the typical congressional district has some 117,000 children in families eligible for a $500 credit. This means families in the typical district would receive $59 million per year in tax relief. The Appendix shows the amount of family tax relief by state. It is difficult to imagine that any single federal spending project of similar magnitude could benefit as many constituents at the same time. Thus, the political advantages of family tax relief would more than outweigh the political disadvantages of cutting the federal spending needed to pay for it.
<p>

<b>#2) Tax Credit to Reduce the Marriage Penalty</b>
<p>
Under current law, dual-income married couples who file a joint return can end up paying more taxes than two single taxpayers filing individually. The House-passed bill takes a small step toward reducing this "marriage penalty" by giving these working couples a tax credit with a maximum value of $145 per year. The size of this credit would be determined by Treasury Department tax tables comparing the tax liability of a married couple filing jointly with their liability if they filed as unmarried workers. While the size of this tax credit is relatively small, it is a first step toward removing the tax code's bias against marriage and intact families.
<p>

<b>#3) New Individual Retirement Accounts</b>
<p>
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) reduce the tax bias against savings by deferring taxes on income (up to $2,000 per year) placed into these special accounts. However, this income and the interest generated by these savings are taxed when retirees begin to withdraw their money. 
<p>
The House-passed plan offers another way for taxpayers to avoid punishing taxes on retirement savings by creating a new IRA called the "American Dream Savings Account" ("ADS account"). Contributions to this account would be made from post-tax income, but the interest from such savings would not be taxed upon withdrawal if the contributions remain in the account for at least five years and the retiree has reached age  59<over>1/2</under>. This new form of IRA would give workers the incentive to save taxed income today in order to reap tax savings in retirement. That is why the ADS account is sometimes known as a "back-ended" IRA. 
<p>
Initially, contributions to the new ADS account would be limited to $2,000 per taxpayer per year ($4,000 for a married couple), but this amount would be indexed to the rate of inflation in subsequent years. The plan also allows penalty-free withdrawals for a first-time home purchase or to pay certain educational or medical expenses.
<p>
The House-passed plan also modifies current restrictions on the amount married spouses may contribute jointly to an IRA. Under current law, and subject to certain restrictions on workers with other retirement plans, individuals may place up to $2,000 into an IRA. However, spouses filing jointly are allowed to contribute only a combined $2,250 to their IRA, not $2,000 for each spouse. The new ADS account allows this same couple to contribute $2,000 for each spouse for a full $4,000, even if one spouse is not working. This provision would greatly assist the retirement plans of families in which one parent chose to stay home with the children. This change also would encourage lower-income taxpayers to save more for their retirement and rely less on Social Security.
<p>

<b>#4) Tax Credit for Adoption</b>
<p>
The estimated two million families ready to adopt children face huge expenses during the adoption process, but current tax law does not allow them to deduct adoption costs from their tax bill. The House-passed plan makes a substantial commitment to encouraging adoption by giving adoptive families a tax credit of $5,000 to offset such expenses as adoption fees, court costs, attorneys' fees, and other related expenses. This credit is available in full to families earning up to $60,000 per year and gradually phased out for families earning up to $100,000 per year.
<p>
This credit could go a long way toward encouraging families who want to adopt less fortunate children but are prevented from doing so by the enormous cost. By encouraging more adoptions by solid middle-class families, this credit could lead to a long-term reduction in the cost of taxpayer-supported social service and foster care programs at both the federal and state levels. According to the American Public Welfare Association, close to 500,000 children were in the foster care system in 1992. Studies show that taxpayers pay an average of $10,000 per child per year for foster care programs and as much as $30,000 per child per year for more intensive shelter care programs.<sup>1</sup>  And while many couples want to adopt, they often are discouraged by the initial costs of the adoption process, especially if they have only a modest income. Thus, to the extent that the credit encourages additional parents to adopt, reductions in state and federal outlays to maintain these children in foster care or institutions would offset the revenue cost.

<p>
<b>#5) Tax Credit for Dependent Parents</b>
<p>
	The current tax code provides little relief to families who choose to care for an elderly parent or grandparent. The standard personal exemption of $2,500 is available for these families, but, as with the dependent child exemption, the value of the credit is greater for middle- and upper-income families than for modest-income families in the 15 percent income bracket. For example, while the standard deduction of $2,500 allows a family in the 15 percent bracket to lower their income tax by $375, the same deduction allows a family in the 28 percent bracket to lower their tax by $700.
<p>
The House plan offers additional -- and more equitable -- tax relief to families who care for their parents and grandparents in the form of a uniform $500 tax credit. Such a credit could help many families who prefer to care for their elderly relatives at home but cannot afford the expense. To avoid burdening their children and grandchildren with this expense, many seniors are divesting themselves of their wealth in order to become eligible for the long-term program funded by Medicaid. This program, which pays for nursing home care for seniors, is quickly becoming the fastest growing program in the federal budget. The $500 tax credit could help reduce this cost by encouraging more families to take an active role in caring for their elderly relatives.
<p>

<b>TAX RELIEF FOR SENIORS</b>
<p>
The House budget proposal contains provisions that are especially important to many retired or terminally ill Americans with particular financial needs. It repeals the "elderly surtax" provisions of President Clinton's 1993 tax increase, which imposed a high tax rate on income from savings, investments, and pensions.<sup>2</sup>  In addition, it provides tax incentives for the purchase of private long-term care insurance, allows terminally and chronically ill people to receive insurance benefits before their death without an income tax penalty, and increases the amount individuals between age 65 and 69 may continue to earn from employment without losing their Social Security benefits.

<p>
<b>#6) Repeal of the Tax Increase on Social Security Benefits</b>
<p>
	Over four million retired Americans were shocked to discover a severe penalty in their 1994 federal taxes, imposed by the 1993 tax bill on their income from savings for retirement. The penalty imposed by Section 86 of the Internal Revenue Code creates a higher marginal tax rate for all Americans over age 65 who supplemented their Social Security pensions with personal savings and pensions earned during their working years. Withdrawals from IRA savings accounts are particularly hard hit, and these withdrawals are mandatory after age 701/2. Retired people above that age cannot avoid turning over significant portions of their retirement savings to the tax collectors.
<p>
The House plan gradually repeals the 1993 increase in this tax on savings over a five-year period but does not eliminate it entirely. It cuts the maximum tax to 75 percent in 1996, 65 percent in 1997, 60 percent in 1998, 55 percent in 1999, and 50 percent in 2000 and later years. The complete elimination of this highly complex section of the tax code should be a top priority in Congress, since it is a direct attack on responsible individuals' ability to prepare for retirement by saving. House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) has identified this tax as a priority for repeal:  "punishing people who work and save all their life...is not only morally wrong, it is bad social policy."<sup>3</sup><p>All Social Security recipients must fill out a complicated worksheet just to calculate whether they are subject to the higher tax rate, which adds to the complexity of the tax code for these senior citizens. The tax computation also obscures the higher rates, since the method of figuring whether it is due has been made extremely confusing and depends on how much income anyone receives from savings. For most Social Security recipients, the additional complicated paperwork this April 15 was simply bothersome, because their calculations placed them below an exempt threshold. But the higher rates hit hard those taxpayers with retirement income greater than $25,000 ($32,000 for married taxpayers) from private pensions, withdrawals from an IRA or 401(k) savings plan, and dividends or interest from investments. Although incomes below the exemption are not subject to the higher rates, the tax threshold amounts are not indexed for inflation, so in a few years most if not all retired Americans with income from savings will be penalized.
<p>
The elderly surtax has two brackets. The first increases the taxpayer's marginal rate by 50 percent (for example, from 15 to 22.5 percent); the second, by 85 percent (from 28 to 51.8 percent). The second bracket applies to individuals with incomes above $34,000 and married taxpayers above $44,000. As the table on the following page illustrates, for taxpayers in the top income tax bracket of 39.6 percent, the elderly surtax imposes an effective marginal tax rate of 73 percent on any funds they withdraw from IRA savings. These high rates begin to wipe out mandatory IRA withdrawals at age 701/2.
<p>
The low savings rate for retirement among middle-income Americans in the prime of life is one of the most serious policy concerns in Congress today. Yet the surtax on savings for Social Security recipients, of which many seniors often are unaware until they start withdrawing their IRA savings, makes a mockery of the incentives to save. It is a cruel joke because the tax rates are higher, not lower as most savers were promised. Repealing this vicious surtax on the savings of elderly Americans is not just good social policy. It is the right thing to do.
<p>

<b>#7) Modify the Social Security Earnings Test	</b>
<p>
	Approximately two million Americans over age 65 supplement their Social Security benefits with income earned through part-time jobs. For many elderly people, retirement is out of the question because it would mean economic hardship. They simply have inadequate savings or no private pension benefits. The Social Security law has cut benefits severely for retirees who continue to work and earn more than $11,280. This limitation applies to those between the ages of 65 and 70 and is indexed annually for inflation. Those who earn more lose $1 in Social Security benefits for every $3 of wages earned. The House of Representatives budget proposal would raise the annual earnings limit to $30,000. The increases would be phased in over five years:  from $15,000 in 1996 to $19,000 in 1997; $23,000 in 1998; $27,000 in 1999; and $30,000 in the year 2000. The earnings limit thereafter would be indexed for inflation.
<p>
The earnings limit requires the Social Security Administration (SSA) to recalculate pension benefits and attempt to collect amounts paid to retired people who earned more than the law permits. Retirees must forecast their year's earnings in advance and have their Social Security cut, but if their estimated income is too low, they must fill out application forms to recover their lost benefits. The SSA estimates that 60 percent of all overpayments and 45 percent of all underpayments occur because of the earnings limit. This limit costs over $200 million per year in administrative paperwork, most of which would be saved by expanding the earnings limit as proposed in the House budget resolution.
<p>
In the next few decades, the generation approaching retirement generally will have inadequate savings to enjoy leisure without supplemental earnings. In addition, the lower birthrate in the past two decades will have tightened the labor market, so many elderly workers may find their experience and skills still very much in demand. The U.S. economy will enjoy higher economic growth and semi-retired workers will have a more adequate standard of living with the proposed modification in the Social Security earnings test.
<P>

<b>#8) Provide an Incentive for Private Long-Term Care</b>
<p>
	As the health of elderly Americans improves and more people live to very old age, the financial burden of providing care for this increasingly dependent group has become a challenge for public policy. Increasingly, middle-class Americans discover later in life that despite the prudent decisions they have made to cover their income and health care needs during retirement, they face unanticipated and staggering costs for nursing home care. Many see the savings and other assets assembled during their working lives disappear rapidly when they become chronically sick or frail and need institutional care. One response to this threat has been for elderly Americans to transfer assets to their children so that they can qualify for nursing home assistance under the Medicaid program. States and the federal government are concerned about the rising cost of the long-term portion of Medicaid, partly because of this "gaming" of Medicaid. 
<p>
In an attempt to control future budget outlays for health and welfare benefits, people should be given effective incentives to provide for their own long-term care. The House budget resolution provides several new tax provisions to encourage individuals and employers to provide long-term care insurance. Starting in 1996, long-term care insurance generally would be treated the same as accident and health insurance, and employers would be allowed to provide their employees with tax-free long-term care insurance just as they now often provide medical benefits. Individuals would be allowed to exchange existing life insurance policies or annuity contracts for long-term care policies without incurring any income tax liability. They also would be permitted to withdraw funds from IRAs and other tax-sheltered retirement plans to purchase long-term care insurance.
<p>
Although medical expenses are deductible from federal taxes when they exceed a certain percentage of income, long-term care expenses today generally are not tax-deductible. Under the House budget resolution, eligible long-term care premiums and expenses for qualified long-term care services would be treated the same as other medical expenses, and benefits received under a long-term care insurance policy would be tax-free (up to $200 per day).
<p>
Placing long-term care benefits on the same basis as health care and financing them under tax provisions similar to those for medical insurance makes good sense, especially in view of the growing elderly population. Delaying the incentives to prepare for an easily foreseen future problem would be shortsighted, making more likely even heavier state and federal spending on nursing home care.
<p>

<b>#9) Accelerated Payment of Life Insurance Benefits for the Terminally Ill</b>
<p>
	Under current law, life insurance benefits are not taxed, but insured individuals and their families have no way to obtain benefits prior to death without a severe income tax liability -- even though many insurance companies are willing to offer such "accelerated benefits."  In the case of lingering illness with no prospect of recovery, an elderly person could exhaust all his savings and apply for Medicaid, unable to claim potentially huge life insurance benefits. And if the elderly person no longer has the means to make premium payments, his policies may be allowed to lapse.
<p>
The House budget includes a provision to facilitate the practice by which some insurance providers pay benefits prior to death if the insured person is terminally or chronically ill. Such payments would be excluded from a taxpayer's gross income, just as payments to a surviving beneficiary now are. In addition, similar tax-exempt treatment is allowed for amounts received from the sale or assignment of a life insurance contract to a qualified settlement provider. In these cases, the insured would receive a payment comparable to the value of insurance benefits, and the settlement provider eventually would collect the insurance. As in the case of long-term care benefits, the tax-exempt amount for someone who is chronically but not terminally ill would be subject to the $200 per day exclusion limit.
<p>
The tragedy of terminal illness and the financial burden of chronic illness ought to be sufficient misery for anyone, but the federal tax code adds a degree of bureaucratic hostility. Life insurance is offered with benefits payable under these circumstances, and older policies can be sold or converted to obtain benefits before death. The income tax code should be made more consistent with this humane and increasingly common practice.

<p>
<b>TAX RELIEF TO PROMOTE JOBS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH</b>
<p>
	In addition to family tax relief provisions, the House-passed budget resolution includes a number of reforms designed to reduce the tax burden on savings and investment. Included in this category are:
<p>
<b>#10) Reduction in Capital Gains Tax</b>
<p>
	The U.S. tax code unfairly and unwisely punishes capital investment by taxing investment income more than once:  twice through the corporate and individual income taxes and again by taxing capital gains. The current maximum tax rate on capital gains is 28 percent, and these gains are not indexed to the inflation rate. By contrast, most of America's major economic competitors, such as Japan or Germany, exempt capital gains from taxation entirely or tax them at a greatly reduced rate while often indexing the basis of the gains to inflation.
<p>
The House bill lessens this penalty in two ways. First, it lowers the maximum capital gains rate to slightly below 20 percent. Second, it permits individuals to index the value of assets to ensure that they are not being taxed on purely inflationary gains. This rewards new investment and risk-taking. As the Appendix illustrates, this provision will reduce the tax burden on investment by an estimated $63.2 billion between 1995 and 2002.<sup>4</sup>  It is a positive, albeit limited, step toward the goal of eliminating capital gains taxes.<p><b>#11) Neutral Cost Recovery </b><p>Under current law, businesses must write off capital investments from their tax liability over a number of years. This is different from all other business expenses that can be deducted in the year of purchase, or "fully expensed."  However, the value of a long-term write-off is less than the original cost of the investment because the amounts deducted in later years lose their value.
<p>
The House plan corrects these penalties in the tax code by indexing the depreciation schedules for business investments to inflation and the time value of money. The House bill adjusts depreciation schedules (which determine how fast businesses can deduct the cost of new investments) to protect investors from inflation and otherwise remove biases against investment, particularly for long-term projects. The provision is designed to approximate the ideal tax policy of immediate expensing of capital investment (as found in the flat tax). By correcting this flaw in the tax code, Congress would help encourage businesses to invest more heavily in America's future economic growth.

<p>
<b>#12) Alternative Minimum Tax </b>
<p>
	 The House bill repeals the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax and modifies the individual AMT. These provisions impose some of the heaviest compliance costs and raise limited revenues. Combined with the Neutral Cost Recovery provision, AMT relief would ease the tax burden on American business by about $42 billion over seven years (see Appendix for state totals).
<p>

<b>#13) Expensing for Small Business</b>
<p>
In addition to neutral cost recovery, the House bill increases the amount of investment which can be immediately expensed. Along with other modest reforms, small business will realize $11.4 billion of tax relief (see Appendix for state totals).
<p>
The House tax provisions are a positive first step on the road to pro-growth tax reform. Adoption would boost incentives to save and invest, thereby ensuring faster growth for the economy and higher incomes for American workers.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
The dilemma facing the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee is how to allocate among families, businesses, and seniors the $245 billion in tax relief provided in the fiscal 1996 budget resolution. The priorities established in the $354 billion House-passed tax relief package are the place to start. 	 Family tax relief, capital gains cuts, and expanded IRAs should be the centerpiece of the new package, as they were for the House-passed plan, because of their widespread benefits to taxpayers and the economy. In particular, the $500 per child tax credit will benefit some 35 million working families, more taxpayers than any other measure. Further, the halving of the capital gains tax and the expansion of IRAs will generate more investment and savings than any of the more targeted measures in the House plan. And as Members add other elements to the new plan, they should also keep in mind the impact that certain tax relief proposals may have on federal outlays. Tax relief that returns money to Americans, and gives them an incentive to make provision for such things as nursing home care for their parents or themselves, also can reduce the cost of federal and state programs.

"The flat tax has some serious hurdles to overcome<br> 
before it can go from tax concept to tax code."</i><br>
-- J.D. Foster<br>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
<br>
The flat tax is the vanguard of tax reform, and for good reason. It is  
sound economically and easy to explain. It corrects some long-standing  
problems with the current tax system: complexity, high costs of  
administration and compliance, a depressing effect on the economy, and  
the unfairness of double taxation of income from capital. Its strengths  
have gained the flat tax many ardent fans and have brought it from an  
obscure oddity debated by economists to the forefront of the tax-policy  
debate.   
<p> 	  
Flat-tax advocates are nearly evangelistic in their drive to replace the  
current tax system, often as an integral part of their broader agenda to  
reshape government. They are also often unwilling to acknowledge that,  
despite its strengths, the flat tax also has some weaknesses and some  
serious obstacles to overcome before it can go from tax concept to tax  
code.

<b><a name="Flat Tax">WHAT IS A FLAT TAX?</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
Any tax with a single tax rate could be considered a flat tax. A flat tax on  
labor and business income has been popularized by professors Robert E.  
Hall and Alvin Rabushka of the Hoover Institution. A flat tax on labor  
and business income is also embodied in legislative proposals advanced  
by Congressman Dick Armey, the majority leader in the House of  
Representatives, and Senator Arlen Specter, a presidential contender.  
These flat-tax proposals do not tax income from saving; they are  
therefore a form of consumption tax.  
<p> 	  
One of the great advantages of a flat tax is its neutrality. It taxes all forms  
of income only once and does so at a single rate. It taxes individuals'  
labor income at a single rate after allowing for personal exemptions, and  
it taxes business's net cash flow at the same rate that applies to  
individuals. The flat tax thus gives no relative advantage to any means of  
earning income. It favors neither capital nor labor, neither physical nor  
intellectual capital, neither manufacturing nor real estate. By contrast,  
under current law, the federal government uses the tax code to  
micromanage the economy, distorting the allocation of resources such as   
capital and labor, and thereby diminishing both the level of economic  
activity and the standard of living.  
<p>	  
The flat tax is also vastly simpler than the current system and thus  
virtually transparent to taxpayers -- that is, taxpayers need not become  
lawyers or CPAs to understand the intent and application of the tax  
system. Such transparency is important for individuals and businesses   
making economic decisions, for taxpayers' confidence in the fairness of  
the system, and for assuring taxpayers that the tax code will not become a  
tool of deliberate or accidental oppression by government. Much of the  
distrust bred by the federal tax system derives from a suspicion that it  
conceals traps to snare the unwary taxpayer and torture him with tax  
penalties, interest charges, tax liens, and possibly jail. The flat tax aims to  
be so simple and transparent that taxpayers could shelve their fear of the  
tax man.  
<p>	  
<b>Individuals under a flat tax.</b> Taxable income under a flat tax includes all  
wages and salary, and excludes all capital income such as dividends,  
interest, rental income, and capital gains. In addition, all nonwage forms  
of labor compensation are also excluded, such as employer-provided  
health insurance and subsidized parking. The tax on individuals,  
therefore, is essentially a payroll tax collected at the employee level.  
Most flat-tax proposals also allow the taxpayer to take personal  
exemptions and an additional exemption for each child in the household,  
effectively creating a zero tax rate for low-income filers. Under the   
Armey version of the flat tax, for example, a single filer is allowed a  
$13,100 exemption ($26,200 for married, filing jointly), and the plan  
allows for a $5,300 exemption per dependent. Having calculated taxable  
income net of the personal and child exemptions, a flat tax imposes a  
single tax rate on any remaining taxable income.  
<p>	  
The most striking feature of a flat tax is that it eliminates the special  
deductions, phase-outs, and credits in the federal income tax, ensuring  
that most individuals could calculate their tax liability easily -- hence the  
claims by flat-tax advocates that a tax return could be filed on a postcard.   
(In his plan, Specter retains the two most popular individual deductions,  
the home-mortgage interest and charitable deductions.)  
<p>	  
Simplicity for the individual is indeed one of the flat tax's best selling  
points. It is a point that is often oversold, however. Under the flat tax,  
there are two tax rates -- zero and approximately 20 percent. No doubt a  
reduction in the number of tax rates would make tax planning easier, but  
for most individuals the number of rates is irrelevant to their   
actual tax filing.  
<p>  
The simplification of the calculation of taxable income may also be  
oversold. For the approximately 80 million tax filers who take the  
standard deduction, the difference in tax computation between the flat tax  
and current law is that taxpayers today must add their interest, dividends,   
and capital gains to the tax base. They do not suffer the complexities of  
tax deductions because they opt for the standard deduction. For the  
approximately 32 million itemizers, the flat tax offers a clearly simpler  
system. But taxpayers who itemize do so voluntarily. They itemize   
because it lowers their tax liability. Thus, for itemizing taxpayers, the flat  
tax represents a loss of a preferred option in the way they file their taxes.  
Flat-tax advocates assume that most itemizing taxpayers would happily  
give up their credits and deductions in exchange for a simpler tax system.  
<p>	  
<b>Businesses under a flat tax.</b> The taxation of businesses under a flat tax  
makes even greater strides towards simplicity and neutrality. All  
businesses are treated the same; no distinction is made between  
partnerships, sole proprietorships, corporations, and any other business  
form. There is a single tax rate. And businesses are taxed on their net  
cash flow, not on their net income as under current law, thereby  
eliminating all the complications of attempting to match the timing of  
income and expenses.   
<p>	  
Under a flat tax, a business calculates its net cash flow for the year by  
totaling its receipts from all sources and subtracting all payments made  
to its employees and all payments made to other businesses for such  
things as plant and equipment and inventory. Businesses would deduct  
from income the full cost of their investments at the time of purchase,  
instead of stretching out these expenses according to complicated  
depreciation schedules. Employee fringe benefits would not be  
deductible. Nor would interest payments. The business then calculates its  
tax liability by applying a single tax rate to its net cash flow.  
<p>	  
<b>More than just a tax system.</b> In the current political environment, the flat  
tax is far more than an alternative tax system. The flat tax is also a strong  
political and philosophical statement about the role of tax policy in   
society, as seen most clearly in the strong preference of flat-tax advocates  
for a single tax rate for all taxpayers.   
<p>	  
For decades, the prevailing doctrine of "tax fairness" has dictated a highly  
progressive income-tax system. This means that, as a family's income  
rises, so do its average and marginal tax rates. Under current law,  
progressivity is achieved through a combination of deductions,  
exclusions, phase-outs, and rising tax rates imposed on a comprehensive  
measure of income. For example, in 1994 a married couple with $50,000  
in Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and two children, taking the standard  
deduction, would pay 10.1 percent in federal income tax, whereas the  
same family with $100,000 in AGI would pay tax at an 18.5 percent rate.  
<p>	  
Under a flat 20 percent tax rate, a family would be subject to a 20 percent  
rate however high its labor income above a certain threshold. Having  
exempted lower-income taxpayers from the tax, many flat-tax advocates  
believe that proportionality, not progressivity, reflects the prevailing   
sense of fairness in America: Taxpayers should pay more tax as their  
incomes rise, but the amount of tax should not increase more than  
proportionally.  
<p>	  
Flat-tax proposals actually include two tax rates -- zero (by virtue of the  
personal exemptions) and about 20 percent. Some critics worry that the  
inclusion of a zero tax rate in the flat tax will maintain a large  
constituency for expanded government. The dangers are apparent in any   
general system of taxation that allows any but the poorest of the poor to  
escape paying at least some tax when they have taxable income. Taxes  
reflect a price we pay for government. Whenever someone escapes  
paying tax to finance government services, the direct cost of those  
services is zero and the amount of services demanded is high. Even a   
minimal tax of a few dollars a month would remind taxpayers                                                                   
that government services are not free.  
<p>	  
Many advocates of the flat tax are using the tax reform debate as a means  
of reshaping the political debate. By directly challenging the doctrine of  
tax progressivity in the federal tax system, they seek to change not only   
established ideas about desired tax burdens, but also the very notion of  
using the state as an instrument of incomes policy. Nor does the challenge  
stop there.   
<p>	  
Armey has included as part of his proposal the elimination of income-tax  
withholding. To many, withholding is simply a convenience whereby  
their employers subtract a certain amount from their paychecks each pay  
period based on an estimate of the total tax due for the year. To Armey  
and others, however, tax withholding disguises the true magnitude of the  
taxpayer's federal individual income-tax liability. By clouding the amount  
paid, they argue, taxpayers object less to the tax burden and to the  
amount of government spending that tax receipts make possible. By  
replacing the withholding mechanism with a monthly payment directly  
from the taxpayer to the Treasury, Armey believes he will bring powerful  
new forces to bear on the size of the tax burden and the size of  
government.

<b><a name="Economic Benefits">ECONOMIC BENEFITS</a></b><br> 

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
Tax reform is a long and difficult process. Even the adoption of an ideal  
tax system creates transition costs for taxpayers, economic dislocation,  
and uncertainty. What benefits would justify these costs?  
<p>	  
<b>Saving, investment, and economic growth.</b> The net national savings rate  
in the U.S. has averaged 2.7 percent per year in the 1990s, less than one  
third the rate of the 1950s and 1960s. The savings rate is a prime  
determinant of the growth of incomes and wealth, so a low savings rate  
obviously does not bode well for future growth in standards of living.   
Certainly one contributing factor to the low savings rate is the high tax  
rate on saving and investment, due in part to the double taxation of  
income from capital. The flat tax would tax income from capital only  
once -- in the form of a tax on business income. Dividends, capital gains,  
interest payments, and other forms of capital income received by  
individuals would not be taxed, because they had already been taxed  
before. The flat tax would thereby reduce the tax burden on saving,  
which means, everything else held constant, that a flat tax would increase  
the rate of private saving.  
<p>	  
The flat tax may also reduce the tax burden on investment by eliminating  
the double taxation of corporate income and allowing businesses to  
deduct in full the cost of their plant and equipment purchases. However,  
the flat tax also appears to increase the overall tax burden of businesses   
(more on this later) so the net effect on investment incentives   
may be muted.   
<p>	  
The purpose of  encouraging saving and investment is, of course, to  
promote faster non-inflationary economic growth, boost real wages, and  
raise the nation's standard of living. At a recent conference sponsored by  
the Hoover Institution, Dale W. Jorgenson of Harvard presented a paper,   
"The Economic Impact of Fundamental Tax Reform," showing that the  
adoption of a consumption tax such as the flat tax would increase the  
discounted value of Americans' future income by about $1.3 trillion.  
<p>	  
Such increases certainly justify considering a change in tax systems.  
Projecting increases in economic activity is risky business, however,  
since the projections always depend on the underlying assumptions. At  
the same conference, Laurence J. Kotlikoff of Boston University  
presented results based on a different type of economic model indicating  
that a switch to a consumption tax would eventually increase real wages  
by 7 percent and GDP per capita by 8 percent. These two studies are  
impressive and, because they are based on different types of models,  
credibly imply that the economy would perform significantly better under  
a flat tax or another consumption tax than it would under the current  
income tax.	  
<p> 
It is important to recognize that accelerated economic growth also means  
accelerated tax collections for federal, state, and local governments.  
While congressional and Treasury Department analysts persist in  
ignoring these additional revenues, policymakers should understand that   
additional economic growth will mean additional tax revenue. Using  
Jorgenson's estimates of economic growth, in present-value terms a flat  
tax could eventually raise well over $200 billion in additional federal  
revenues and $150 billion in additional state and local revenues.  
<p>	  
<b>Compliance and administrative-cost savings.</b> According to an analysis by  
the Tax Foundation, the annual compliance costs associated with the  
federal personal and corporate income taxes are roughly $200 billion.  
These costs result from recordkeeping, tax filing, litigation and appeals,   
and so forth. In addition, the federal government spends almost $14  
billion administering the system, for a total annual cost of well over $800  
per person.   
<p>	  
Most compliance costs are borne by the business sector, and most of  
these costs can be attributed to those areas of the tax code dealing with  
the timing of income and expense, and with the taxation of foreign- 
source income. The flat tax is a tax on cash flow, and so at a stroke it  
eliminates the issue of timing. It also exempts from U.S. tax the foreign-  
source income of U.S. citizens, so it eliminates this compliance cost as  
well. And, at the individual level, most compliance costs arise in relation  
to capital income, which would no longer be taxed, so these costs, too,  
disappear. While every tax system imposes some administrative and   
compliance costs, there is good reason to believe the flat tax eventually  
would dramatically reduce this burden on the taxpayer and on the  
economy.  
<p>	  
<b>Thoughts of lower interest rates.</b> Proponents of the flat tax (and of many  
other tax reform proposals) often suggest that lower (nominal, after-tax)  
interest rates would ensue. If a flat tax raises saving levels as promised,  
the amount of capital available for domestic and foreign investment  
would increase and, if everything else were held constant, this could  
reduce interest rates under certain circumstances. Everything else is not  
held equal, however. 
<p>
The flat tax may also improve investment  
opportunities by reducing the marginal tax burden on capital income.  
Recall that the double taxation of corporate income would cease and   
that businesses could, for example, expense their capital purchases. Thus,  
the domestic demand for new investment in plant and equipment may  
also increase. At this point, we cannot say whether saving would increase  
more or less rapidly than investment. 
<p>
However, as the modern mantra  
runs, we live in a global economy, and no markets are more completely  
integrated than the capital markets. This means that, to the extent   
domestic saving exceeds the demands of the economy for capital, the  
excess saving finds its way overseas in search of more profitable  
investments. And, when domestic saving is insufficient to meet domestic  
investment demands, we import capital from abroad. Thus, whether  
domestic saving increases more rapidly than investment following a flat  
tax, or vice versa, no significant effect on after-tax interest rates should   
be anticipated on this score. 
<p>
Pre-tax interest rates are nevertheless sure to  
decline following a flat tax. Interest rates reflect many factors, including  
expected inflation, a real, after-tax required rate of  return, a degree of  
uncertainty and, possibly, a degree of credit-market tightness. Interest  
rates also reflect the taxes the interest income recipient must pay, which  
explains, for example, why there is a significant difference in the interest   
rates paid to taxable and tax-exempt bond holders. Under a flat tax,  
interest income is tax-exempt, so pre-tax interest rates would fall to about  
what are currently the rates paid on tax-exempt bonds. 
<p>
On the flip side,  
interest expense is not deductible under a flat tax, so there would be no  
net reduction in after-tax interest costs to borrowers and hence little or no  
stimulation of growth from lower interest rates.  
<p>
<center>  
<b><a name="Middle-Class">PROBLEM #1: A MIDDLE-CLASS TAX BURDEN</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	  
At the tax rates currently discussed, the flat tax appears to impose a  
higher share of the total federal tax burden on middle-class taxpayers and  
appears to raise their taxes in dollar terms as well. Each of these  
represents an enormous political problem for flat-tax advocates.  
<p>	  
A progressive rate structure means that upper-income taxpayers pay a  
higher proportion of their labor income in taxes than do all other  
taxpayers. A revenue-neutral flat tax would shift some of the tax burden  
on labor income from upper-income taxpayers onto the middle class. This  
shift of tax burden to the middle class is exacerbated by the exclusion   
of capital income from the tax base, which on a per-capita basis is a  
larger fraction of a typical upper-income individual's taxable income than  
that of a middle-income individual. Finally, large personal exemptions  
would remove millions of lower-income individuals from the tax rolls.   
Consequently, the middle class would be forced to bear a greater share  
yet of the total tax burden.  
<p>	  
Flat-tax advocates take the fairness issue head on by advocating only one  
(or two) tax rates. Where the flat tax really attempts to redefine tax  
fairness, however, is in the exclusion of capital income from the tax base.  
Justice and tax neutrality are both served by excluding capital income  
since the capital has already been subject to tax at least once, if not   
many times over. Nevertheless, a clear problem of perceptions must be  
admitted.  
<p>	  
Consider two families. The Joneses have a combined salary of $50,000 in  
wages and salary. Under the Armey plan with a 20 percent tax rate, this  
family of four would owe $3,700 in tax. Now consider the Smiths, who  
in retirement consume every dollar of their $1 million in dividend  
income. Under the flat tax, the Smiths owe no tax at all because capital  
income is excluded from the tax base. This is appropriate, because their  
dividend income was taxed at least once before the Smith family received  
it. But the perception would persist that a wealthy family is paying no tax.  
<p>	  
When capital income, which would not be subject to personal income tax,  
is considered along with wage

<hr width="50%">
<Font Size="2"><b>Less progressive.</b>  One potential criticism of the flat tax is that high-income groups appear to pay a lower percentage of their personal income in taxes than middle-income groups.  This occurs because higher-income groups receive a greater share of their earnings from capital income, which is exempt under the flat tax.  <b>Source:</b>  The Tax Foundation.<br>

<p>
income, average tax rates for higher- 
income groups are lower than for middle-income groups under the  
individual side of the flat tax (see chart below). And so this may be the  
Achilles' heel of a flat tax: Are the majority of the American people  
willing to define tax fairness entirely in terms of labor income? Can tax  
fairness be defined in such a way that individuals who consume 
significant  
amounts of capital income would be allowed to pay little or no tax? If so,  
then the flat tax has overcome its biggest hurdle. If not, then a flat tax  
solely on labor income probably cannot succeed.   
<p>	  
Flat-tax advocates can overcome this hurdle through careful analysis. As  
we shall soon see, a flat tax will shift the incidence of taxation sharply  
from individuals to business. While individuals will pay no tax on their  
own capital income, the businesses from which they earn capital income   
will pay higher taxes. The crucial point is this: The burden of business  
taxes is ultimately borne not by the entities that pay them but, one way or  
another, by workers (in the form of lower compensation) or by business  
owners (in the form of lower profits), who tend to belong to the higher- 
income group.  
<p>	  
The chart on page 29 shows the average tax paid at different income  
levels under a flat tax when business taxes are imputed to individuals.  
Following procedures adopted by the Congressional Budget Office, the  
Tax Foundation assumes that half of the business tax is ultimately paid by   
business owners and half is paid through reduced labor compensation.  
The imputation of the business tax shows a disproportionate share of the  
business-tax burden falling on upper-income taxpayers.  
<p>	  
The chart shows the distribution of the tax burden when we account for  
both the individual and business taxes under current law, under the  
Armey proposal with a 20 percent rate (which Armey argues reduces  
revenues by $40 billion annually relative to current law), and under a  
revenue-neutral version of the Armey proposal which the Tax   
Foundation calculates would require a 21.1 percent rate. (The lower rate  
claimed by Armey probably arises because his plan, by design, loses  
revenue relative to current law.) As the chart shows, when income is  
measured comprehensively and both labor and business income are taxed,  
the flat tax imposes a remarkably proportional tax burden (once  
individuals earn enough to pay tax).   
<p>	  
Analysis of the likely distribution of the tax burden also reveals some  
disturbing news for flat-tax advocates, however: At the proposed rates,  
the flat tax would impose a tax increase on middle-income taxpayers.  
This obviously creates an enormous political problem for flat-tax  
proponents. Many middle-income voters may object to a significant tax   
increase in exchange for a simpler tax system and the   
promise of a stronger economy. One solution is, of course, to   
cut spending to reduce the tax rate below 17 percent. This is   
Armey's solution. As noted below, however, this is far easier   
said than done.   
<p>
<center> 
<b><a name="Business End">PROBLEM #2:  THE BUSINESS END</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Successful tax reform must always originate in the barber shops and  
bingo parlors outside the Washington Beltway. Without sustained popular  
support, the enormous effort of fundamental reform will fall short. A new  
tax principle, having gained the necessary popular support, must then  
gain the support, or at least the acquiescence, of the bulk of the business  
community. Tax reform that fails employers will fail their employees as  
well.   
<p>	 
The simplicity of the flat tax would eventually benefit the business sector  
by reducing both compliance costs and the uncertainty that a complex tax  
code imposes on business decisions. On the other hand, the business  
sector, at least under the Armey flat tax, appears to bear a much higher  
share of the total federal tax burden. Currently, the business sector bears  
about 31 percent of the burden. Under the Armey flat tax, according to  
Tax Foundation analysis, the business sector would bear about 50 percent  
of the burden, an increase of about two thirds. In other words, under the  
Armey plan about 19 percent of the total tax collection is shifted from  
individuals to businesses. The higher burden on businesses is due to  such  
things as the loss of the deductions for state and local taxes and for  
employee fringe benefits. (Some of this burden would eventually be  
shifted back to individuals, as companies convert fringe benefits into  
labor income on which individuals would have to pay taxes.)  
<p> 	 
It is, of course, true that businesses only collect taxes; individuals  
ultimately bear the tax burden. Nevertheless, business leaders are very  
aware of their average tax rate and the after-tax earnings they report to  
their owners. The business community in the aggregate suffered a hefty  
tax increase as part of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, though much smaller  
than that apparent in the Armey flat tax. Many of today's CEOs and chief  
financial officers were tax directors and tax vice-presidents in 1986, and  
they remember how a laudatory tax principle eventually boomeranged to  
their firms' detriment. Business owners are likely to resist any tax  
proposal that would raise their effective tax rates, even if it promised to  
accelerate economic growth.   
<p>	 
At the very least, successful tax reform should probably avoid increasing  
the net tax burden on America's businesses. Even so, such reform would  
still create lists of winners, losers, and uncertains. Traditionally, the  
uncertains oppose tax reform while projected losers fight harder against   
their losses than winners will fight for their gains, so even a revenue- 
neutral tax reform between individuals and businesses is likely to create  
important opposition to a flat tax.  
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="Other Obstacles">OTHER OBSTACLES</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Aside from the basic tax-burden questions, there is a long list of obstacles  
for the flat tax to overcome:  
<p>	 
<b>Charitable contributions.</b> Under the current income tax, itemizing  
taxpayers can deduct amounts contributed to charitable organizations  
(churches, certain civic groups, educational institutions, research  
organizations, etc.) in calculating their taxable income. The charitable  
deduction is defended by politically powerful organizations from Harvard   
University and the Boy Scouts to the Catholic Church and the American  
Association of Retired Persons. For itemizers, contributions to these  
groups under current law are made in pre-tax dollars. Under a flat tax, the  
tax incentive to make a contribution is eliminated, so all such  
contributions must be made in after-tax dollars. Some decline in  
charitable giving should be expected for virtually all charities, at least  
initially, following the enactment of the tax. Over the long run, of   
course, the higher incomes and capital accumulation produced by a flat  
tax will lead to increases in giving that will offset the initial decline. Even  
so, charitable groups, recognizing the immediate threat to their funding,  
will surely lobby to keep the charitable deduction in the tax base.   
<p>	 
<b>Tax receipts under the Armey plan.</b> Flat-tax advocates also often strongly  
favor a smaller federal government, and the arguments in favor of one  
occasionally intermingle with arguments in favor of the other. However,  
a flat tax implies little or nothing about the desired level of government   
spending or taxation. It is a revenue system capable of raising a wide  
range of tax revenue levels depending on the tax rate chosen. Without  
question, a flat tax would be easier to enact and implement if the federal  
government

<hr width="50%">
<Font Size="2"><b>More proportional.</b>  When income is defined comprehensively to include business income, taxes on higher-income groups remain remarkably proportional.  That's because the flat tax appears to shift some of the overall tax burden to businesses, whose taxes are borne disproportionately by (higher-income) business owners.  <b>Source:</b>  The Tax Foundation.<br>

needed less revenue. General tax cuts would help avoid the  
contest of winners and losers that typically impede tax reforms. Also,   
all tax reforms impose adjustment costs on the economy as resources are  
re-allocated and re-priced. These costs would be easier to bear in the  
context of reduced overall tax burdens.   
<p>	 
The initial tax rate under the Armey flat tax is set at 20 percent, which  
Armey argues would reduce federal collections by about $40 billion  
annually; the tax rate drops two years later to 17 percent. The Armey plan  
argues forcefully for funding these cuts with spending cuts. Over the   
traditional five-year budget window, setting the flat rate at 20 percent  
means cutting spending by about $250 billion. To put it in perspective,  
the budget passed by the House Budget Committee in May to eliminate  
the deficit called for spending cuts of $459 billion over five years.   
<p>	 
The spending cuts needed to fund the Armey flat tax would be in addition  
to those in the Fiscal Year 1996 Budget Resolution. For advocates of a  
dramatically smaller government, a call for additional spending cuts to  
fund flat-tax reform is more of an opportunity than a problem. But,   
given the difficulties of achieving the cuts in the budget resolution, it is  
fair to question whether additional cuts of this size are possible. At this  
stage, the possible responses of the flat-tax advocates would seem to be  
either that the revenue scoring must include revenue gains from projected   
accelerated economic growth or that the extra spending cuts are possible  
and desirable.  
<p>	 
<b>The flat tax and the health care debate.</b> Under a flat tax, the employer  
would no longer be allowed to deduct the cost of employee health- 
insurance coverage. This arrangement eliminates a serious distortion in  
the current system -- the tax advantage of employer-provided health   
insurance. Denying employers the ability to deduct the cost of health  
insurance will discourage them from continuing to provide insurance as a  
benefit. Instead, they are likely to raise wage and salary income, and  
families would have to buy their own insurance. Eventually, such a  
family-based system should work as well for health insurance as it does  
for any other form of insurance.  
<p>	 
At the outset, the flat tax could expose individuals to much higher  
insurance premiums if they no longer receive the benefit of group rates.  
This is a serious transition issue for the flat tax for which no good  
solution seems available. One could, for example, require employers to  
continue to offer insurance for a specified period following tax reform.   
Another solution would be to require insurers to continue coverage  
indefinitely for previously covered employees, and set insurance  
premiums at the levels applicable to the employee's previous group.   
<p> 
<b>Double taxation and state and local taxes.</b> Alongside tax neutrality,  
avoiding double taxation between tax jurisdictions is a fundamental goal  
of good tax policy. Double taxation occurs when an individual pays tax to  
one entity and must pay tax to another jurisdiction on the tax paid to the  
first. For example, when a taxpayer pays $100 in state tax ad the federal  
government includes that $100 in the taxpayer's income for federal  
income-tax purposes, then the individual is effectively paying tax on  
taxes received by the state. This is unfair to the taxpayer.  
<p>	 
With the exception of sales taxes, state and local taxes are currently  
deductible for itemizers at the individual level and for all corporate  
taxpayers, thereby avoiding double taxation. This deduction is typically  
eliminated under a flat tax, thereby assuring double taxation and bringing  
new pressures on state and local government finances. A flat tax would  
disproportionately raise the costs of living and doing business in high-tax  
states and localities. Recognizing the threat, state and local government  
officials would strenuously oppose this change in policy. On the other  
hand, many advocates of smaller government would applaud the  
additional fiscal pressures on government under a flat tax, even at the  
price of a measure of unfairness.   
<p>	 
<b>Transition issues.</b> They say the Devil is in the details, and that is certainly  
true of tax reform. But the Devil is in his Heaven when dealing with  
transition issues. A complicated economy subject to a complex tax  
system produces extraordinary business and contractual arrangements. A   
simpler tax system may eliminate the need for some of these  
complications going forward, but the old arrangements would still be in  
force and must be addressed. The limited space available here precludes a  
discussion of these issues, but they would include the depreciation of  
previously purchased plant and equipment, the taxation of deferred  
foreign-source income, the use of accumulated Alternative Minimum Tax   
Credits, etc.

<p>	 
Tax reform, and the flat tax in particular, is intended to replace a very  
poor tax system with a simpler tax promising better economic  
performance. Once such a system has been designed, the level of  
collections demanded of it is a matter of choosing the tax rate.  
<p>	 
The federal government, however, collects a wide variety of other taxes,  
including sales taxes on gasoline and other items, payroll taxes, and user  
fees which should also be considered for replacement. For example,  
federal sales taxes are highly distortionary, require separate and costly  
collection mechanisms, and are generally thought to be regressive.   
<p>	 
Once a new tax base has been established, strong arguments should be  
required in favor of keeping any of the other existing components of the  
federal tax system. Failing such arguments, we should give serious  
consideration to replacing these other, inferior tax systems, making up the   
revenue with a higher flat tax rate. A flat-tax rate of between 38 and 40  
percent would likely raise enough revenue to allow the elimination of the  
payroll tax and all other federal taxes.  
<p>	 
The nation faces many serious economic problems, including Social  
Security and Medicare systems racing towards bankruptcy, a costly  
private health-care system, and high regulatory burdens. So tax reform  
has some steep competition for national attention. It is all the more   
impressive, therefore, that the flat tax's advocates have succeeded in  
moving tax reform to the forefront so quickly. Replacing the current tax  
system with something significantly better, whether a flat tax or an  
alternative, will not solve all our economic ills. But the more rapid  
economic growth it promises may make finding the other solutions a   
little easier.

<h3><a name="Addendum">Taking on the Mortgage-Interest Deduction</a></h3>
<hr width="60%">

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
If the flat tax is to gain the support of the public, its advocates will have to confront defenders of existing 
deductions head on. The most important deduction for most itemizing individuals is the mortgage-interest deduction. Many observers defend this deduction as encouraging home ownership; some argue that it is necessary for tax neutrality. Under the Armey flat tax, the deduction disappears.
<p>
Many groups believe they would be injured by the elimination of the mortgage-interest deduction. They 
argue, for example, that the loss of the deduction would raise the cost of home ownership, reduce the value of existing homes, and generally cripple the home building industry. In combination, the realtors, the home-builders, the mortgage lenders, and the construction-workers unions make a very powerful lobby, particularly when millions of homeowners are added to the mix.
<p>
The concerns of the mortgage-interest deduction lobby are generally misplaced. As noted above in the 
discussion on interest rates, the tax a saver must pay on interest income is recovered by demanding a higher interest rate. Since a flat tax does not tax individual interest income, pretax market interest rates will fall significantly, just as tax-exempt bonds now pay interest more than 2 percentage points below the rate paid to taxable bonds. Mortgage lenders, seeing their cost of funds fall, will be driven by competition to pass these savings along to mortgage borrowers in the form of lower mortgage rates.
<p>
In after-tax terms, the elimination of the home-mortgage deduction will neither raise nor lower the interest
cost of home-mortgage borrowing. Therefore, that reform should have no affect on the demand for homes or on property values.
<p>
The benefit of lower mortgage rates does not extend to current mortgage holders unless they refinance their mortgages. Thus a legitimate problem is the treatment of mortgages underwritten prior to the enactment of a flat tax. Most of these borrowers assumed they would be able to deduct mortgage interest paid, thereby producing a lower after-tax interest rate and a lower tax burden. Since an estimated 27.4 million taxpayers will claim this deduction in 1995 to the tune of about $238 billion, a potentially huge bloc of voters stand ready to join the ranks of flat-tax opponents. While many or most may be able-to refinance, refinancing may be impractical for many current mortgage holders if, for example, they expect to sell the property in the following year or two.
<p>
A fair (and politically sensible) solution to the old mortgages problem might be to allow homeowners to 
deduct the interest on mortgages taken before the flat tax is enacted. While fairness demands 
grandfathering pre-existing mortgages, the consequence would be a slightly more complicated tax system and a short and medium-term erosion of the tax base, which would have to be offset with initially higher tax rates.
<p>
A loss in the battle over the mortgage interest deduction would not derail the essential effort to develop a flatter, simpler, more saver-friendly tax system. It would, however, require a much higher tax rate initially, and it would make it harder to repeal other popular deductions, like that for charitable contributions.

<i>"Any sales tax will inevitably become a<br> 
complex, pervasive, multi-rate value-added tax."</i><br>
 -- Dick Armey<br>
</center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<br>
One of the most refreshing feelings in the new Washington is the growing  
sense that our current tax system is not long for this world.  
<p>	 
Only days after the November election, Congressman Bill Archer, the  
chairman of the House tax-writing committee, boldly declared his desire  
to "tear out the income tax by its roots." House Speaker Newt Gingrich  
and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole have since formed a commission   
to consider entirely new alternatives. Presidential candidates Phil Gramm,  
Richard Lugar, and Arlen Specter want to scrap the system. A half dozen  
congressional panels are holding hearings on the subject. Even  
Congressman Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, has  
floated a major rewrite (albeit without details).   
<p> 
The question is no longer whether America will get rid of its burdensome  
tax system; the question is, what new system should we replace it with? It  
is a question that will likely dominate our politics through the next  
election.  
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="The Contenders">THE CONTENDERS</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
There are three main contenders: One is a plan advanced by Senators  
Sam Nunn and Pete Domenici. They were among the earliest to call  
attention to the most economically lunatic feature of the current tax code  
-- the highly destructive double taxation of savings -- and develop a   
way to fix it. Called the "USA Tax," their proposal, while fairly  
complicated, defers taxation on income that is saved, while taxing income  
that is used for consumption. It is a sincere and innovative effort to  
encourage the savings necessary for continued economic growth.  
<p>	 
The second contender, which I strongly favor, is the flat tax. Designed to  
make the tax system as neutral and simple as possible, the flat tax would  
sweep away all loopholes, deductions, and exemptions, and replace them   
with a single generous personal allowance. All other income would be  
taxed at one low rate of 17 percent. As the plan's authors, economists  
Robert E. Hall and Alvin Rabushka, have pointed out, a flat tax would  
allow Americans to figure their taxes on a form the size of a postcard.  
The use of the tax code by would-be social engineers would end. Like the  
USA Tax, the flat tax would also end the double taxation of saving.  
<p>	 
While support for the flat tax is soaring -- almost 60 percent of  
Americans appear to favor a version of it, if polls are to be believed -- the  
Nunn-Domenici plan may have been overtaken by events. Conceived at a  
time when it appeared to many that the redistributionist Democratic Party  
would control Congress indefinitely, the plan contains sharply  
progressive tax rates that would kick in at surprisingly low income levels.  
It addresses the disincentive to save quite well, but it may make the other  
problems in the code, high rates and complexity, even worse than the  
current system. With the new politics in Washington and across the  
country, superior alternatives are now clearly within political reach.  
<p>	 
Then there's choice number three: the national sales tax. This is a  
sweeping plan to wipe away the current system and replace it with an  
unprecedented federal tax on retail purchases. Although it's not as widely  
discussed as the flat tax, it has substantial support among many far- 
thinking conservatives, including Archer and Lugar. Indeed, there are   
few conservative hearts that could not be at least a little warmed by its  
central promise to end the income tax altogether.   
<p>	 
This last choice demands serious examination at the moment. Although  
well-intentioned, the sales-tax option has several serious flaws. Before  
getting into that, though, we must remember that supporters of all these  
plans are allies in a fight to end America's single greatest impediment to  
achieving its possibilities: the IRS code, circa 1995.  
<p>	 
Any American tax system should meet three basic criteria. It should be  
fair, simple, and pro-growth. The current system fails miserably on all  
three counts.   
<p>	 
Is it simple? Not by a long shot. In 1990, American workers and  
businesses spent 5.4 billion hours preparing their taxes for the  
government. That's more time than it takes to build every car, truck, and  
van manufactured in the United States each year. After seven decades of  
amendments, revisions, exemptions, loopholes, and extensions, the code  
has become an incoherent mess. The IRS now sends out eight billion  
pages of forms and instructions each year. Laid end to end, they would  
stretch 28 times around the circumference of the earth.  
<p>	 
Is it fair? Hardly. The tax system is as much an exercise in social  
engineering as it is a way of raising government revenue efficiently.  
Through its exemptions and loopholes, the government tries to guide the  
economic decisions of free Americans in the misguided belief that the   
government knows best. Among other things, the code tells us that it is  
better to invest in a municipal sewer system than the next Microsoft, that  
buying rather than renting a home is a better choice for everyone  
everywhere, that purchasing air compressors is better than buying  
computer software. Government has neither the competence nor the right  
to make those decisions for us. The pretense that "government knows   
best" is an insult to our citizens.  
<p>	 
Is it pro-growth? As written, the tax code actually punishes savings and  
investment, by placing double or even triple tax burdens on capital. This  
lowers wages, destroys jobs, and depresses the living standards of all  
Americans. At the same time, it burdens American workers with  
punishingly high tax rates and overall tax burdens. With state and local   
taxes and other federal taxes, Americans now pay more in taxes than they  
spend on food, clothing, and shelter combined.  
<p>	 
All who have worked to end this system, no matter what plan they  
currently favor, should be welcomed as members of the tax-reform  
movement.   
<p>	 
Now for a closer look at option number three. What follows is my  
assessment of the major arguments advanced in favor of the national sales  
tax:  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax is not an income tax.</b> The case for a sales tax begins with one  
highly appealing applause line. It will allow us, supporters argue, to  
eliminate the income tax altogether, possibly even repealing the 16th  
Amendment, which authorized it and made Big Government possible in   
the first place.   
<p>	 
Even if that goal were politically feasible -- and I don't think it is -- the  
exchange would come at a high price. We would give up the income tax  
for a more intrusive and pervasive tax system.  
<p>	 
The reason is simple. If the government sets out to collect a new tax at  
the cash register, it will soon have no choice but to extend that tax  
beyond the retailer to every level of production, as it desperately tries to  
stop inevitable and massive tax evasion. Any sales tax will become a  
complex, pervasive, multi-rate, value-added tax. We will soon be living   
under a VAT -- possibly the most insidious tax scheme ever devised.  
<p>	 
Sales-tax backers often oppose a VAT. But that's what they'll get. To  
generate sufficient revenue by taxing goods only at the retail level, the  
government would need to impose a sales tax of at least 20 percent,  
which means that consumers would suddenly find that everything they  
buy appears to be 20 percent more expensive. But people will not pay  
such a high tax. They will either find ways to label their consumer goods  
tax-exempt wholesale items, they will purchase goods in a cash black  
market, or they will evade it some other way. A sales tax, in other words,  
will be immediately undermined by a silent tax revolt, and the  
government -- following the pattern of European countries -- will respond  
by imposing a VAT.  
<p>	 
A VAT is assessed at each stage of production and is much easier to  
collect and enforce for a host of reasons. You can hear the bureaucratic  
lament in a 1993 report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation  
and Development, which noted: "Governments have gone on record as  
saying that an RST [retail sales tax] of more than 10 percent to 12 percent  
is too fragile to tax evasion possibilities, and it is probably not entirely  
accidental that in OECD counties, VAT rates are nearly always above 12  
percent and that, except in Canada and Iceland, RST rates have always  
been well below 12 percent."   
<p>	 
These unhappy governments were speaking from sad experience. In  
1967, 21 developed countries had retail, wholesale, manufacturer, or  
multi-stage sales taxes. Today, 20 out of 21 of these sales taxes have  
become value-added taxes. Every developed country except Australia  
that has had a sales tax now has a VAT. (Even Canada and Iceland,   
mentioned as exceptions when the OECD report was written, have since  
replaced their retail-tax-only systems with VATs.)  
<p>	 
Whether or not the sales tax evolves into a VAT, the government would  
become intimately involved in almost every economic transaction  
between consenting adults. The simplest exchange, from a vegetable  
farmer selling his produce to the corner grocer selling a loaf of bread,  
would be under the shadow of a government tax collector taking his cut.  
In fact, every businessperson in America would become a tax collector  
for the government.  
<p>	 
"But businesses already collect taxes for the government," sales-tax  
supporters counter. There's a big difference. Today, businesses collect a  
relatively small share of the income tax, since three quarters of the  
income in the economy is labor income, paid by individuals. But under a  
sales tax, there is no direct tax on individuals, so businesses will be  
responsible for collecting several times what they collect today. That  
means IRS scrutiny of American businesses could be expected to rise  
proportionately. Since the 10-12 million businesses in America have  
fewer rights under law than individuals, we can expect IRS abuses to rise   
exponentially as well.  
<p>	 
It would be an administrative mess. A national sales tax may well exempt  
many basic necessities from tax --beginning with food and clothing.  
This would lead to bitter disputes over the difference between food and  
candy, between real clothes and costume accessories. Congress and   
the courts would likely find themselves debating the nutritional value of  
Twinkies, the body coverage of sportswear, and much else, just as state  
governments do today, but on a larger scale.  
<p>	 
Worse, the federal sales tax and the dozens of different state sales taxes --  
aside from having different tax rates -- would likely exempt different  
items. That means a small businessperson would need to look up the  
correct state sales-tax rate, apply the federal rate, subtract the state tax  
rate from items exempted only by the state, or subtract only the federal  
rate from items federal-only exempted. Then he would need to do  
separate calculations for each of the states in which he does business.  
(And he would need to catch any mistakes before the tax enforcer  
appears.)  
<p>	 
The likely consequence would be a slowdown in business activity -- and  
a loss of jobs and drop in wages for millions of American workers.   
<p>	 
<b>We could eliminate the IRS.</b> Ignoring or dismissing this inevitable  
tendency for a sales tax to become an all-pervasive VAT -- with a huge  
accompanying bureaucracy -- some sales-tax advocates nevertheless  
argue that the sales tax would allow us to eliminate the IRS altogether.  
<p>	 
The argument is presented with an interesting federalist twist. The states,  
they say, could collect the new federal sales tax through their existing  
sales-tax systems. The federal government, then, could do without its  
own revenue collection agency. We could bring about the ultimate   
devolution of federal authority.  
<p>	 
One immediate problem, however, is that five states do not have a sales  
tax and would not take kindly to enforcing one for Washington. Even  
those that do would consider the costs of collecting a huge federal sales  
tax (the main source of federal revenue) an unbearable federal   
mandate.  
<p>
The enforcement costs for current sales taxes, currently about 5 percent,  
are manageable. However, if you add a 20 percent federal sales tax on top  
of that, the compliance problems grow exponentially. It makes little   
sense for a state government to pay the enforcement costs for a 25  
percent tax when it only gets one fifth of the revenue. Many states would  
simply eliminate their sales taxes.  
<p>	 
But the point is purely academic. For reasons dating back to the unhappy  
years of the Articles of Confederation, the federal government will never  
rely on state governments for its prime source of revenue. It will not  
happen.  
<p>	 
In truth, a sales tax would not eliminate any federal agency. It will  
actually allow a huge increase in the size of the federal government by  
allowing politicians to raise taxes with relative impunity. Why? Because  
sales taxes are hidden from the taxpayers, concealed in the price of the  
goods they buy.  
<p>	 
Try this experiment. Stand outside a grocery store and ask shoppers as  
they leave how much they just paid in sales tax. You'll find that virtually  
no one knows. Can you guess how much you paid in sales tax last month,  
or last year? The problem is, if people don't appreciate how much they  
pay in taxes, it is a lot easier for politicians to raise them.  
<p>	 
<b>Individuals would no longer need to file tax forms with the government.</b>
Since people would pay their taxes whenever they purchase an item,  
some sales-tax advocates argue, the government will never need to know  
a taxpayer's name. There would be no filing of any tax papers at all by an   
individual.  
<p>	 
That's not quite right. Under almost any sales-tax plan, individuals would  
still file with the government -- but for entirely different reasons than  
they do today.  
<p>	 
It's almost certain that one way or another, any federal sales tax would  
need to exempt certain basic necessities in order to make it progressive.  
One way to do this, as I've mentioned above, would be to order retailers  
not to charge tax on food and clothing and whatever else the government   
selects.   
<p>	 
But exempting a handful of items isn't enough. Absent a generous rebate,  
most Americans would face a stiff tax increase under a sales tax. That's  
why most sales-tax proposals provide for a rebate. The truth is, the   
overwhelming majority of Americans would still need to file with the IRS  
to claim their rebate (or else face a substantial tax increase).   
<p>	 
Some have suggested the IRS could simply send out checks to every  
American by Social Security number, obviating the need for taxpayers to  
file with the IRS. This is a fantasy. It wouldn't be long before there were  
more Social Security numbers than citizens. Whether or not Americans   
file directly with the IRS, the potential for fraud is staggering. Even under  
the current Earned Income Tax Credit program, fraud levels are as high  
as 30 to 40 percent. How much fraud would there be if the federal  
government were cutting thousand-dollar checks to every American?  
<p>	  
Of even greater concern is the political dynamic that would develop once  
we couple a hidden sales tax with a highly visible tax rebate. Americans  
would be quietly nickel-and-dimed to death by a sales tax they may  
hardly notice, but every year a very noticeable and generous check would  
arrive from Washington like manna from heaven. Government, and even  
the tax bureaucracy, might become highly popular after all. And in my  
judgment, if there could be anything worse then people hating the IRS, it  
would be for people to love the IRS.	  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax will tax the underground economy.</b> The notion here is that a  
sales tax will more effectively tax illicit trade in both legal and illegal  
goods and services than any income tax. If true, this would bring in tens  
of billions of dollars in revenue to the government as we collect revenue   
from people who are currently outside the system.  
<p>	 
The neighborhood drug dealer almost always serves as the illustration.  
Since the drug dealer declines to file a 1040 form, the argument runs,  
maybe we could at least recoup some of his income through a sales tax.  
The government may have no record that he exists, but when he uses his  
blood money to buy a sports car, the government will collect tax from  
him.  
<p>	 
That sounds compelling at first, but if we think it through, it doesn't hold  
together. Look at it this way: Both systems will equally fail to tax the  
drug trade for the simple reason that the drug dealer will not play along in  
either one. If there's an income tax in place, he won't report his income. If  
there's a sales tax in place, he won't collect tax from his customers. Either  
way, the government loses exactly the same amount of money.  
<p>	 
Consider the following example. Suppose there is a drug dealer who  
makes $50,000 in sales to his customers every year and then turns around  
and spends it. Under an income tax system, we wish to tax the income of  
the dealer and his customers, while under a sales tax we wish to tax all of  
their purchases.  
<p>	 
Under the income tax, we tax the income of the drug consumers  
(assuming they are law-abiding citizens besides their drug use), but we  
can't tax the income of the drug dealer. Thus we lose $50,000 from the  
tax base. Under the sales tax, we tax the purchases of the drug dealer, but  
we don't tax the purchases of the drug consumers. Loss to the tax   
base: $50,000.  
<p>	 
It has to be the case that neither system taxes the value of the drug trade  
because the amount people spend on drugs must equal the income of the  
drug dealer. And since the drug dealer will not report sales or income tax,  
neither system will capture the value of the drug trade.   
<p>	 
The same would hold true for the underground economy in legal goods  
and services as well -- which, of course, is much larger. The proverbial  
plumber who doesn't report his house-call income today would not report  
it for sales-tax purposes either. At best, it will be a wash.  
<p> 	 
Actually, economic reasoning aside, the whole "underground economy"  
argument for a sales tax is flawed. It's obvious that if we try to impose a  
national sales tax of 20 percent or more on the public, the underground  
economy will explode. The "contraband" involved, though, will not be  
just crack cocaine, but virtually any sort of consumer good. That's   
exactly what happened in Canada when the government imposed its  
goods-and-services tax. The tax raised much less than projected.  
Coincidentally, the Canadian Treasury soon noticed a dramatic increase  
in the amount of real currency flowing through the economy. Why were  
Canadians suddenly using so much cash? Guess.  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax will reduce the trade deficit.</b> Supporters say that a sales tax  
will increase U.S. competitiveness by taxing imports and not taxing  
exports. As tax-policy people put it, a sales tax is "border adjustable."  
Since exports aren't sold in the U.S., they would escape a domestic sales  
tax; since foreign imports are sold here, they will get hit. This way,  
American firms receive a significant tax advantage over foreign firms,  
and that will favorably alter our trade balance.  
<p> 
There are very few economists who hold this view, however. An  
immutable law of economics holds that trade surpluses and deficits are  
linked to the amount a nation lends or borrows. When savings are low,  
the trade deficit must be high, but if we substituted a tax on imports for  
some other tax, it will not affect the amount Americans save. That means   
the trade deficit not only will stay the same, it must stay the same, as a  
basic principle of economics.  
<p>	 
Economists might explain it this way (simplifying, of course): If there is  
more investment occurring in our economy than can be financed by our  
savings, then foreign investors must be accounting for the difference. In  
effect, they are taking the money we pay them for their cars and VCRs  
and using it to buy our stocks and bonds, thus supplying the investment  
capital that we don't supply ourselves. This difference is the "trade  
deficit."   
<p>	 
The only way to change the trade deficit, then, is to change our savings  
rate. If we increase our savings relative to our domestic investment, we  
will have less need for foreign cash. The trade deficit will then drop, as  
we spend relatively less money buying foreign goods and relatively more   
investing at home.  
<p>	 
But anything we do to tax incoming foreign goods -- including slapping  
them with a sales tax -- will have no effect on the amount of money  
Americans are putting into domestic stocks and bonds or even their own  
bank accounts. There is simply no relationship between them.  
<p>	 
What will happen instead is this: Our exports will increase at first because  
of the new tax advantage. But since our savings will remain the same, the  
dollar will be artificially strengthened. This will make our exports more   
expensive, and the original balance of trade will be gradually restored --  
along with the original trade deficit. The policy will be self-defeating.  
<p>	 
Even if a border adjustment were to work as its proponents claim, it  
would still be a bad idea. It would make the goods Americans buy --  
whether produced here in America or abroad -- more expensive, while  
foreigners could purchase American-made goods more cheaply. It's hard  
to see how Americans benefit from paying higher prices than foreigners  
do to purchase American products.  
<p>	 
Adam Smith makes a relevant point in The Wealth of Nations. Smith  
reminds us, "Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production;  
and the interest of the producer bought to be attended to, only so far as it  
may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer."  
<p>	 
In a border-adjustable system, however, to borrow from Smith again, "the  
interest of the consumer is almost constantly sacrificed to that of the  
producer; and it seems to consider production, and not consumption, as  
the ultimate end and object of all industry and commerce."   
<p>

<p>
All of the above assumes, of course, that we really could replace the  
income-tax system with a national sales tax. But could we? The roots of  
the income tax go back to the 16th Amendment, passed in 1916 to  
authorize the government to levy a tax on individual incomes. In my  
view, repealing the amendment and ending the income tax for good   
is, politically, not in the cards. Conservatives in Congress have tried for  
years to pass a balanced-budget amendment without success. I believe we  
will eventually succeed, but in the midst of that grueling fight, I believe  
the notion of getting 290 members of the House, 67 members of the  
Senate, and three quarters of the states to repeal the 16th Amendment is a   
dream.  
<p>	 
And that is perhaps the best argument against the sales tax. If we try to  
exchange an income tax for a sales tax, we could easily end up with both.  
It would be a tragic irony if conservatives who favor a smaller  
government unwittingly provide the liberals with a comprehensive new  
taxing authority without eliminating the old one.  
<p>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
We must not lose sight of the commendable motives behind the sales tax.  
Its supporters want a tax code that does not interfere with economic  
decisionmaking, minimizes the paperwork burdens on the taxpayers,  
limits the size of the federal government, avoids excessive taxes on  
savings and investment, and is straightforward and fair.  
<p>	 
For all the above reasons, however, the sales tax is not likely to achieve  
those goals. The flat tax, however, will do so. By placing a single tax rate  
on all income, it will not distort economic decisions. Citizens will be free  
to spend and invest their money as they see fit without taking tax  
considerations into account. The paperwork burden, for most taxpayers,  
will be reduced to filling out a postcard-sized tax return. Americans will  
get an honest bill and know how much their government costs them.  
Savings and investment income will be taxed, but only once. The  
punitive double taxation of savings in the current code will be gone. The  
flat tax meets the tax-reform criteria -- it is simple, fair, and pro-growth.

<H2> June/July Insider -- Flat Tax Fever </H2>
<HR>
<P>Although
it was a largely unknown academic concept just one year ago, the
flat tax today is one of the most talked about policy reforms
in Washington, in large part due to the efforts of House Majority
Leader Richard Armey of Texas. It now looks increasingly possible
that the current income tax system will be junked in favor of
this simple, fair, pro-growth plan. The present system suffers
from three major problems, each of which would be solved by the
flat tax:<P>
<ul>
<li>Problem #1: High tax rates that discourage work, savings,
and investment.Flat Tax Solution: The Armey flat tax replaces
the current discriminatory system of tax rates with a simple,
low rate that treats all taxpayers equally.<P>
<li>Problem #2: Needless
complexity that imposes $200 billion of compliance costs.Flat
Tax Solution: The Armey flat tax allows all taxpayers to fill
out their taxes on a postcardsized form.<P>
<li>Problem #3: Multiple taxation
of capital income that penalizes economic growth.Flat Tax Solution:
Not only are all individuals treated equally, so is all income.
No longer would some income escape taxation while other types
of income are subject to as many as four levels of taxation.
</ul><P>
The
flat tax solves all these problems by creating a tax system that
treats all citizens equally, rewards productive behavior, and
gets the government out of the business of using tax law to micromanage
the economy. The key benefits of the flat tax are:
<ul>
<li>Faster economic
growth: By reducing tax penalties against savings and investment,
a flat tax would spur increased work, saving, and investment.
If enactment of a flat tax boosted longterm annual growth by as
little as 0.5 percent, the income of an average family of four
after 10 years would be as much as $5,000 higher than if current
tax laws remained in place.<p>
<li>Instant wealth creation: According to
Harvard economist Dale Jorgenson, adoption of the flat tax would
boost national wealth by some $1 trillion. All incomeproducing
assets would rise in value since the flat tax would increase the
aftertax stream of income they generate.<p>
<li>Simplicity: One business
in 1992 had a tax return 21,000 pages long requiring 30 volumes.
Individual taxpayers are slightly better off, but the system still
imposes needless costs. Under a flat tax, all taxpayers, from
General Motors to John Doe, would be able to fill out their tax
return on a postcardsized form. Current compliance costs would
drop by tens of billions of dollars. <p>
<li>Fairness:  A flat tax would
treat people equally. A very wealthy taxpayer with 1,000 times
the income of another taxpayer would pay 1,000 times more in taxes.
No longer would the tax code penalize success and discriminate
on the basis of income.<p>
<li>End to micromanaging and political favoritism:
 The flat tax gets rid of all deductions, loopholes, credits,
and exemptions. Politicians would lose all ability to pick winners
and losers, reward friends and punish enemies, and use the tax
code to impose their values on the economy. According to Professor
Alvin Rabushka of Stanford, $100 billion of uneconomical investments
are made for tax purposes, funds that would be used to boost economic
growth under a flat tax.<p>
<li> Increased civil liberties: Under current
laws, those charged with murder have more rights than taxpayers
dealing with the IRS. With a simpler, fairer tax code, however,
infringements on freedoms and privacy would fall dramatically. <P>
<li>Political
feasibility: Unlike the national sales tax or value added tax, the
flat tax does not require either repealing the 16th amendment
or running the risk of creating an entirely new revenue source
for tax hungry politicians.The Heritage Foundation has published
two papers on the flat tax: Jobs, Growth, Freedom, and
Fairness: Why America Needs a Flat Tax (Backgrounder #1035) and
A Brief Guide to the Flat Tax (Talking Points). Heritage
is also leading a flat tax working group comprised of more than
100 representatives of think tanks, congressional offices, trade
associations, citizens groups, and businesses. In addition to
broad discussions about status and strategy, the working group
has subcommittees designed to address key issues involving the
media, public awareness, transition problems, and Capitol Hill.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole
have founded a "Tax Reform and Economic Growth" commission
charged with developing a fair and simple tax system. Heritage
President <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Ed Feulner</a> will serve as one of 13 appointees, as well
as the vice-chairman of the commission.<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There has been a surge in support for a flat tax in recent months, thanks largely to the efforts of House Majority Leader Richard Armey (R-TX). Many Americans see the current tax system as a complicated failure that hinders the nation's growth while allowing the politically well-connected to manipulate the system to get special breaks not available to average workers and businesses. The flat tax, on the other hand, is simple, treats all taxpayers equally, and greatly increases incentives to work, save, and invest.
<p>
<b>WHAT IS A FLAT TAX? </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There have been several flat tax proposals over the years. While they differ in important ways, almost invariably they contain three features, each designed to fix a major problem with the current tax code. The major features of a flat tax are:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Single flat rate.</b> All flat tax proposals have a single tax rate that applies to all income subject to tax. Flat taxes also usually include provisions to ensure that all income is taxed just once. The actual tax imposed varies, with rates in some plans as low as 10 percent and in others approaching 20 percent. The low, flat rate solves the problem of high marginal tax rates by reducing penalties against working, saving, investing, and entrepreneurship.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Elimination of deductions, credits, and exemptions.</b> Flat tax proposals eliminate provisions of the code that bestow preferential tax treatment on certain behaviors and activities. Examples of such preferential treatment include deductions for home mortgage interest, charitable contributions, and state and local taxes. Eliminating these special provisions solves the problem of complexity, allowing taxpayers to file their tax returns on a postcard-sized form.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>No double taxation of savings and investment.</b> Flat tax proposals are designed to reduce or eliminate the tax code's bias against capital formation by ending the double taxation of income used for savings and investment. Simply stated, these plans often have the equivalent of a "super-IRA," which basically means that taxpayers would be taxed only on the portion of income that is consumed. This reform to ensure that income is not subject to a second level of taxation is needed since today's tax code penalizes future economic growth by discouraging capital formation.
<p>
<b>ADVANTAGES OF A FLAT TAX</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are two principal arguments for a flat tax -- growth and simplicity. Many economists are attracted to the idea because the current tax system, with its high rates and multiple taxation of savings and investment, reduces growth, destroys jobs, and lowers incomes. A flat tax would not eliminate the damaging impact of taxes altogether. But by dramatically lowering rates and ending the tax code's bias against savings and investment, it would boost the economy's performance when compared with the present tax code. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For many Americans, however, the most persuasive feature of a flat tax is its simplicity. The complicated documents and instruction manuals taxpayers struggle to decipher every April would be replaced by a brief set of instructions and the lengthy forms by a simple postcard-sized return. This radical reform appeals to citizens who not only resent the time and expense consumed by their own tax forms, but also suspect that the existing maze of credits, deductions, and exemptions gives a special advantage to those who wield political power and can afford expert tax advisers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If enacted, a flat tax would yield major benefits to the nation, including: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Faster economic growth.</b> A flat tax would spur increased work, saving, and investment. By increasing incentives to engage in productive economic behavior, it also would boost the economy's long-term growth rate. Even if a flat tax boosted long-term growth by as little as 0.5 percent, the income of the average family of four after ten years would still be as much as $5,000 higher than it would be if current tax laws remained in effect.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Instant wealth creation.</b> According to Harvard economist Dale Jorgenson, a flat tax would boost national wealth by some $1 trillion.<sup>1</sup>  The reason:  all income-producing assets would rise in value since the flat tax would increase the after-tax stream of income they generate.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Simplicity.</b> All taxpayers, from General Motors to a teenager flipping hamburgers, would be able to fill out their tax return on a postcard-sized form, and compliance costs would drop by tens of billions of dollars. According to a study conducted for the IRS, the current tax code requires taxpayers to devote 5.4 billion hours each year to their tax returns.<sup>2</sup>  Yet even this commitment of time is no guarantee of accuracy. The code is so complex that even tax experts and the Internal Revenue Service often make mistakes.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Fairness.</b> A flat tax would treat people equally. A very wealthy taxpayer with 1,000 times the taxable income of another taxpayer would pay 1,000 times more in taxes. No longer, however, would the tax code penalize success and discriminate against citizens on the basis of income.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>An end to micromanaging and political favoritism.</b> The flat tax gets rid of all deductions, loopholes, credits, and exemptions. Politicians would lose all ability to pick winners and losers, reward friends and punish enemies, and use the tax code to impose their values on the economy. According to Professor Alvin Rabushka of Stanford, co-author of <i>The Flat Tax</i>, $100 billion of uneconomical investments are made for tax purposes.<sup>3</sup>  Under a flat tax, those funds would be used to boost economic growth.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Increased civil liberties.</b> Under current law, people charged with murder have more rights than taxpayers dealing with the Internal Revenue Service. With a simpler, fairer tax code, infringements on freedom and privacy would fall dramatically.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Friendliness toward families.</b> Under the Armey proposal, a family of four would be able to shelter the first $36,800 of income from taxes. Other proposals include similar family allowances.
<p>
<b>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</b>
<p>
Q:  Should the rich pay more?
<p>
A:  Under a flat tax, the rich do pay more than the poor. A wealthy taxpayer with 100 times more taxable income than his neighbor will pay 100 times more in taxes. A flat tax, however, does not impose special penalties on those who contribute most to the nation's prosperity by subjecting them to punitive and discriminatory tax rates. For those who think the "rich" should pay a higher percentage of their income, the generous family allowance in, say, the Armey bill and others effectively creates a modest level of "progressivity." 
<p>
 Q:  Would a flat tax reduce the budget deficit?
<p>
A:  It depends on the tax rate, what happens to spending, and how much faster the economy grows under a flat tax. Even taking supply-side effects into consideration, at some point lower rates do translate into less revenue. The size of the personal exemption or family allowance also plays a key role since the decision to protect a certain amount of income generally means the rate on income above that level has to be higher. The Armey proposal probably would cause tax revenues to be lower, particularly in the short term. It also includes spending provisions that would cap the growth of government, however, so the long-term effect would be to reduce government borrowing.
<p>
Q:  What would happen to charitable contributions and housing markets?
<p>
A:  Some worry that the transition from the current system to a new one would create problems for charities and homeowners. History suggests these fears are exaggerated. During the 1980s, the top tax rate was reduced dramatically, falling from 70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent in 1988. The effect was to reduce the value of itemized deductions by the same amount, yet the value of housing did not drop. Similarly, charitable contributions actually rose sharply during the 1980s. This does not mean itemized deductions have no importance; it simply indicates that the benefits generated by a robust economy more than offset any costs associated with lost deductions. 
<p>
 Q:  Is there not a risk that politicians will raise tax rates in the future?
<p>
A:  As recent events demonstrate -- base broadening in 1986 followed by tax rate increases in 1990 and 1993 -- this is a real danger. But this is not an argument against the flat tax. It is further evidence of the need for a constitutional amendment that requires a supermajority to raise taxes.
<p>
Q:  Should the income tax simply be abolished and replaced by a sales tax?
<p>
A:  A flat tax does not eliminate the harmful aspects of income taxation; it only reduces them. Some have suggested that the better approach is to replace the income tax with a national tax on consumption. While attractive in theory, however, the danger is that Americans could end up not with a sales tax replacing the income tax but with a sales tax <i>and</i> an income tax. A sales tax should be considered only as part of a campaign to repeal the 16th Amendment (which allowed the income tax). Otherwise, such an effort could play into the hands of those who want to impose a national sales tax or value-added tax (VAT) as one more way for politicians to get new money to spend.
<p>
Q:  Does a flat tax eliminate the marriage penalty?
<p>
A:  It all depends on how the flat tax is structured. The marriage penalty refers to the increased tax a couple face if they choose to get married. A flat tax automatically solves part of this problem since it would no longer be possible for one spouse's income to push a couple into a higher tax bracket. The penalty also arises, however, if the personal exemption for a married couple is not twice the size of the exemption for those filing singly. By giving a married couple twice the exemption of a single filer, the Armey proposal solves this problem. 
<p>
 Q:  What counts as taxable income under a flat tax?  Fringe benefits?  Capital gains?
<p>
A:  A key principle of most flat tax proposals is that all income be taxed, but only once. Capital gains would be taxed at the business level, but the tax would not be applied a second time at the individual level. Dividend income would be taxed in similar fashion. Fringe benefits are not taxed at all under the current system, but they would be subject to tax, typically on the business level, under most flat tax proposals.
<p>
Q:  How does a flat tax affect business and payroll taxes?
<p>
A:  Most flat tax proposals, including the Armey plan, reform the corporate income tax as well as the personal income tax. Most, however, do not address payroll taxes. Both Social Security and Medicare face significant long-term structural problems. But while flat taxes could be designed to include substantial reform of Social Security and Medicare financing mechanisms, most lawmakers believe that problems of the income tax code should be addressed separately from those faced by retirement programs.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The current income tax system punishes the economy, imposes heavy compliance costs on taxpayers, rewards special interests, and makes America less competitive. A flat tax would reduce these ill effects dramatically. Perhaps more important, it would reduce the federal government's power over the lives of taxpayers and get the government out of the business of trying to micromanage the economy. There will never be a tax that is good for the economy, but the flat tax moves the system much closer to where it should be- raising the revenues government demands, but in the least destructive and least intrusive way possible.

<B> INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
     Overtaxed American families finally have reason to cheer. There
is growing bipartisan sentiment in favor of passing tax cuts for
families with dependent children as part of next year's budget.
Congressional Republicans recently announced their commitment to
reintroducing next year the $500-per-child tax cut they proposed in
this year's Republican budget alternative. Also, reports now indicate
that there is renewed White House interest ("Clinton Still Favors
Middle-Class Tax Cut Despite Broken Vow," The Washington Times,
September 7, 1994. See also David Wessel, "For Clinton, the Politics
of a Tax Cut Are Sure to Clash With the Economics," The Wall Street
Journal, September 6, 1994; Hobart Rowen, "Economic, Political
Advisers Collide Over Clinton's Middle-Class Tax Cut," The Washington
Post, September 11, 1994.) in fulfilling Bill Clinton's campaign
promise to "grant additional tax relief to families with children."
(Bill Clinton and Al Gore, Putting People First (New York: Times
Books, 1992), p. 100.) Though skeptical voters may see such reports as
merely election year politics, there seems to be sufficient common
ground to give struggling families hope that tax cuts could move to
the top of Washington's agenda next year.<P>
     There are sound reasons why Washington should quit talking about
cutting taxes for families and take the necessary action to make it a
reality:
<P>
Families with children are overtaxed. In 1948, the average American
     family with children paid only 3 percent of its income to Uncle
     Sam. Today the same family pays 24.5 percent. (This figure
     includes federal income and Social Security payroll taxes.)
<P>
Families have been taxed out of house and home. The average family now
     loses $10,060 per year of its income due to the 45-year increase
     in federal taxes as a share of family income. This tax loss
     exceeds the annual cost of the average family home. (For more
     information, see Robert Rector, "Reducing the Crushing Tax Burden
     on America's Families," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 981,
     March 7, 1994.)
<P>
Millions of families stand to benefit. The families of 52 million
     American children, or 60 million families, are eligible for a
     $500-per-child tax credit.
<P>
Tax cuts are good for low-income families. A $500-per-child tax credit
     would eliminate the entire federal tax burden for 4.7 million
     working families.
<P>
Most families are middle-class. Nearly 86 percent of all children live
     in families with incomes below $75,000 per year -- middle-income
     by any standard -- and some 94 percent live in families with
     incomes below $100,000.
<P>
Cutting taxes for all families -- regardless of income -- is fair. A
     $500-per-child tax credit would give a family of four earning
     $18,000 per year a 33 percent tax cut and a family earning
     $40,000 per year a 10 percent tax cut, while giving a family
     earning $200,000 per year a cut of only 1.5 percent.
<P>
Family tax relief is good politics. The typical congressional district
     has some 117,000 children eligible for a $500 tax credit. This
     means families in the typical district would receive $59 million
     per year in tax relief.
<P>
     The family is the core of American society. It is the principal
mechanism through which values, knowledge, discipline, and motivation
are passed from one generation to the next. If the family is weakened,
government programs cannot repair the damage. But government policies,
especially tax policies, are undermining the American family. The
ever-increasing tax burden on families with children must be reversed
if American society is to regain its health and vitality.
<P>
<B> BIPARTISAN TALK OF TAX CUTS </B><P>
     During the presidential campaign, candidate Clinton promised to
reduce the taxes paid by families with children. "Virtually every
industrialized nation recognizes the importance of strong families in
its tax code; we should too," declared Clinton. "We will lower the tax
burden on middle class Americans.... " ("Putting People First: A
National Economic Strategy for America," Clinton campaign document,
1992, p. 9.)<P>
     Until recently, President Clinton has ignored that pledge to
relieve Washington's tax burden on working families with children. On
the contrary, Clinton last year signed the largest tax increase in
American history. As a result, taxpayers this year will send some $35
billion in extra taxes to Washington.<P>
     Families with children could have been spared this new burden. In
March, the Democrat-controlled Congress rejected the $500-per-child
tax credit plan contained in the fiscal 1995 budget alternative
proposed by House and Senate Republicans. Had it passed, some 60
million American families could have deducted $500 per year from their
tax bill for each child.<P>
     The Republican tax cut plan was financed through cuts in
government spending and thus would have had no impact on the federal
budget deficit. Over five years, implementing a $500-per-child tax
credit would reduce federal tax revenues by some $108 billion. This
revenue loss, however, would be fully matched by reductions in federal
spending. Thus, the deficit would neither increase nor decrease.
     House Republicans recently announced that they will reintroduce
this plan in next year's budget. Coincidentally, perhaps, the White
House reportedly is considering tax cuts for families with children
"when the time is right." (Steven Pearlstein, "Election Year Has White
House Pondering Tax Cut Politics," The Washington Post, September 9,
1994.)<P>
     The time is right for families who have seen their income tax
burden grow by over 300 percent during the past 45 years. Since there
is growing bipartisan sentiment for family tax cuts, now would be the
time for the White House and Members of Congress to promise American
families that they will include, at a minimum, a $500-per-child tax
credit in next year's budget.
<P>
<B> HOW WASHINGTON HAS HIKED TAXES ON CHILDREN </B><P>
<I>(This section is derived largely from Robert Rector, "How to
Strengthen America's Crumbling Families," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No. 894, April 28, 1992.)
</I><P>
     Federal taxation of families with children has increased
dramatically over the past four decades. In 1948, the typical family
of four paid just 3 percent of its income to the federal government in
direct taxes. In 1992, the equivalent family paid nearly 24.5 percent
of its income to the federal government. As Chart 1 shows, when state
and local and indirect federal taxes are included, the tax burden on
that family equals 37.6 percent of its income.<P>
     Federal income taxes have risen much faster for families with
children in the last four decades than for other groups of Americans.
The root cause of this growing anti-family bias in the federal income
tax code is the eroding value of the personal exemption. The personal
exemption for children was intended to offset part of the annual costs
of raising a child by allowing families to deduct an amount of money
from their taxable income. In 1948, the personal exemption was $600.
This was equal to roughly 17 percent of the median income of a family
of four, then $3,468. This shielded 68 percent of that family's income
from federal income tax. Families could protect most of the remaining
32 percent by itemizing deductions or by taking the standard
deduction. The result: in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the average
family with children paid little or no income tax.<P>
     In the past four decades, however, increases in the personal
exemption have lagged far behind the rise in incomes and inflation. As
the value of the personal exemption has declined, the income tax paid
by families with children has increased. For the personal exemption
today to have the same value relative to family income that it had in
1948, it would have to had been $7,000 in 1992 and would have to rise
to $8,000 in 1996.<P>
     The second tax blow to family finances has been the increase in
Social Security taxes, technically known as "payroll taxes." In 1948,
workers paid a two percent Social Security tax on annual wages of up
to $3,000; one percent was paid directly by the employee and one
percent indirectly by the employer through the so-called employer
share. (Liberal and conservative economists agree that both shares of
the Social Security tax are in fact taxes on workers' wages. See
Joseph A. Pechman and Benjamin A. Okner, Who Bears the Tax Burden?
(Washington, D.C.: The Brookings Institution, 1974), pp. 25-43.)<P>
     By 1992, combined Social Security taxes had risen to 15 percent
of wages on incomes up to $55,500. While all workers have suffered
from skyrocketing payroll taxes, the burden has been most severe for
working families with children. The reason for this is that Social
Security taxes, unlike regular income taxes, are not adjusted for the
number of dependents in the family. So a working parent trying to
support a family of four feels the sting of this tax far more sharply
than a single person at the same wage level. The effect of Social
Security taxation is particularly severe on lower-income parents; a
family with an income of $25,000 per year, for instance, pays $3,750
in payroll taxes.<P>
     The Government Assault on Family Income. Chart 2 shows the growth
in direct federal taxes as a share of median family income. In 1948,
effective tax rates equaled 3 percent of income for the average family
of four. By 1970, they had risen to 16 percent; by 1992, to 24.5
percent.<P>
     The income loss due to increased taxation has seriously strained
American family finances and profoundly affected American family life.
Chart 3 shows the effects of increases in federal income and Social
Security taxes since 1948 on the finances of the average family. Total
pre-tax income for the median family of four in 1992 was $47,787.
(Data from the U.S. Bureau of the Census. Total pre-tax income
includes the employer share of Social Security tax deduction from the
worker's wages.) After taxes, this family's income fell to $36,915. If
federal taxes as a percentage of family income were restored to 1948
levels, the family's post-tax income would have been $10,060 higher,
or $46,975. In other words, the loss of income in 1992 because of the
increase in federal taxes as a share of family income, due to the
falling value of the personal exemption and the rise in Social
Security taxes since the late 1940s, was $10,060.<P>
     This income loss severely affects the ability of families to
support themselves. The median price of a single-family home purchased
in 1992, for instance, was $103,700. The average annual mortgage
payment on such a home (including principal and interest) was $7,380.
Thus, the annual family income loss due to increased federal tax rates
for the average family in the last four decades actually exceeds the
annual cost of an average home mortgage by 36 percent.
<P>
<B> THE SOLUTION: TAX CREDITS FOR CHILDREN</B>
 <P>    There are two practical ways to reduce the tax burden on families
with children: first, by increasing the value of the personal
exemption and, second, through the use of tax credits. Although many
positive arguments can be made for increasing the personal exemption,
the tax credit is better policy in the long run because it is less
complex and because it can be used more effectively to reduce the tax
burden on lower-income working families.
  <P>   With an income tax exemption, income equal to the amount of the
exemption is excluded from tax. Thus, for a family in the 15 percent
income tax bracket, a $500 increase in the personal exemption
decreases income taxes owed by $75. A $1,000 increase in the
exemption, as some have proposed, decreases a family's tax burden by
$150. 
   <P>  By contrast, under a tax credit, the amount of the credit is
deducted from taxes paid, directly reducing tax liability. Thus, for
the same family in the 15 percent income tax bracket, a $500 credit
decreases net taxes by $500. Another important difference between the
credit and the increased exemption is that a tax credit can be applied
to both income and Social Security taxes (both the employer's and
employee's share). Because the current personal exemption, now set at
$2,350, is already sufficient to eliminate most or all of the income
tax liability for many low-income families, increasing its value will
protect no more of their income from the IRS. A credit, though, could
relieve this family's income tax liability and offset a portion of its
Social Security taxes.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Example: A family of four with a gross earned income of $20,000 has a
     total federal tax liability of $3,615: $555 in income taxes and
     $3,060 in payroll taxes (both shares). A $1,000 increase in the
     personal exemption for children would reduce this family's tax
     burden by only $300 ($150 for each child), a tax cut of less than
     10 percent. However, a $500-per-child tax credit would reduce the
     family's total tax bill by $1,000, enough to eliminate their
     income tax burden and reduce their Social Security taxes by an
     additional $445. Overall, they would see their total federal tax
     burden reduced by over 27 percent. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<B> The $500-per-child Tax Credit is Not Refundable</B>
  <P>   When Republicans proposed the $500-per-child tax credit during
this spring's budget debate, the White House and congressional
Democrats argued that such a credit was not needed because they had
expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the 1993 tax bill.
This expanded EITC, they said, delivered tax cuts to millions of
working families with children. Such a claim is misleading and ignores
the difference between a wage subsidy and a tax cut.
  <P>   The EITC is a wage supplement for working families with children
with incomes up to $26,000 per year. It is intended to offset the
Social Security tax burden on these families and increase their wages
through a cash subsidy. As shown in Chart 4, the amount of cash
returned to some families through the EITC can exceed their entire tax
burden. Technically, this means the EITC is "refundable."
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Example: A family of four earning $14,000 (slightly below the official
     poverty level) will pay no income taxes but will bear a Social
     Security tax burden of roughly $2,140. This family is eligible to
     receive, however, some $2,400 from the EITC, nearly $260 more
     than their entire tax burden. For some working families, the cash
     value of the EITC can exceed their entire federal tax liability
     by as much as 60 percent. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
     By contrast, the $500-per-child tax credit is not refundable.
This means that the value of a family's tax relief may not exceed
their tax burden. However, as Chart 4 shows, low - and modest-income
families still would have a large share of their total tax burden
eased by such a credit.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Example: A family of four earning $17,000 per year may still have a
     total tax burden of roughly $840 after deductions and after
     receiving the EITC wage subsidy. Though a $500-per-child tax
     credit might otherwise give them $1,000 in total tax relief
     because of their two children, the fact that this credit is not
     refundable allows them to deduct only what they owe -- $840 --
     from their tax bill.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<B> Millions of Families Shielded from the IRS</B>
<P>     Some Democrats argued during last spring's budget debate that the
$500-per-child tax credit was not "fair" because families earning
below $16,000 per year would not get a tax cut. This argument is
ridiculous, as the preceding examples demonstrate. It is clearly
impossible to give a tax cut to families who not only do not pay in
federal taxes, but also stand to receive a substantial cash wage
subsidy from the federal government.
    <P> But for many low-income working families who do pay taxes, a $500
per-child tax credit would bring badly needed relief. Indeed,
according to The Heritage Foundation's tax simulation model, based
upon the U.S. Bureau of the Census 1992 Current Population Survey,
some 4.7 million working families would have their entire federal tax
liability eliminated if Congress enacted a $500-per-child tax credit.
  <P>   Millions of other low - or modest-income families might not have
their entire tax burden eliminated by such a credit, but they
certainly would see a dramatic decline in their tax bill, and thus a
dramatic increase in their take-home pay.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Example: A family earning $28,000 per year -- and not eligible for the
     EITC -- would have 57 percent of their income tax bill and 17
     percent of their total federal tax bill (income and payroll taxes
     totaling over $6,000) erased by a $500-per-child tax credit.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B> Tax Cuts for 60 Million Families</B>
  <P>   Nationwide, the families of some 52 million American children,
some 60 million families in all, would be eligible for such a $500-
per-child tax credit. Most of the families affected by such a tax cut
fall within what can be considered the middle class. Indeed, nearly 86
percent of all children in America live in families with gross annual
incomes below $75,000 per year -- middle-class by any standard. In
fact, some 94 percent of all children live in families with gross
annual incomes below $100,000. 
   <P>  Tax cuts would bring badly needed stability to many families'
finances. As Chart 5 shows, for the typical family of four earning
$40,000 per year, a $500-per-child tax cut would cut their $9,500
total tax bill by some 10.4 percent, enough to pay one month's
mortgage on the average home.
  <P>   Upper-middle-class families will receive more modest relief. A
family earning $75,000 per year loses nearly $20,000 (approximately 27
percent of their income) to the IRS each year. A $500 tax credit for
each child would mean only a 5 percent tax cut for this family.
<P>
<B> Family Tax Relief Should Not Be Means-Tested</B>
  <P>   Every working family raising the next generation of Americans is
overtaxed. Thus, every working family, regardless of income, should be
eligible for the $500-per-child tax credit. Many Democrat Members of
Congress have argued that giving the same amount of tax relief to
middle-income families as upper-income families is not "fair." They
argue that such a credit should be "means-tested," meaning that
eligibility for the credit should be limited to families within
specified income levels, such as families earning below $75,000 per
year.
 <P>    Means-testing the family tax credit would be a serious mistake.
The tax code should not penalize children simply because of the income
of their parents. (The Dependent Care Tax Credit (DCTC) is not means-
tested. The credit is used by working families -- many of whom are
dual-income and prosperous -- who place their children in day care.)
Because of the nature of most working careers, very few children live
in upper-income families. In fact, fewer than 83,000 live in families
with annual incomes above $200,000 per year, just 0.17 percent of all
American families. (U. S. Bureau of the Census 1992 Current Population
Survey.) Most upper-income parents hit their full earning potential
well after their children become adults themselves.
  <P>   Because of this country's progressive tax system, in which
wealthier taxpayers face higher income tax rates and stingier
deductions, the IRS punishes upper-income families far more severely
than middle-income families. Chart 5 shows, for example, that a family
of four earning $200,000 per year loses 33 percent of its income to
Uncle Sam, almost 10 percent more than is paid by the typical American
family. 
  <P>   Even within this country's progressive tax structure, these
families should still be allowed to take a $500-per-child tax credit.
The reason: the credit is a progressive tax cut by definition. The
value of a $500 credit is greater for low-income families than for
upper-income families. As Chart 5 shows, such a credit for the typical
family of four amounts to a 10.4 percent cut in taxes. But the same
credit for a family earning $200,000 per year amounts to a cut of only
1.5 percent. Members of Congress who believe in a progressive tax
system, should agree that this is "fair."
<P>
<B> Use Spending Cuts to Finance Tax Cuts</B>
  <P>   Washington's budget rules require that revenues lost to the
Treasury from tax cuts must be matched or offset by some combination
of reductions in spending or by increases in other tax revenues.
Recent reports indicate that if the White House does introduce a
family tax cut plan, those cuts would be financed primarily through
higher taxes on other taxpayers. Such a strategy would be wrong.
   <P> There are two important reasons why tax cuts should be financed
by cuts in spending. First, federal spending has grown massively over
the past 45 years, resulting in a greater share of family income lost
to federal taxes. The federal government now spends about $1.5
trillion per year, six times as much as it did in 1948, after
adjusting for inflation. Indeed, in 1993, Washington consumed 22.4
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) compared to just 12.1
percent in 1948, an 85 percent increase. Over the next five years,
this trend will continue.
 <P>    According to the Congressional Budget Office, federal spending
will grow by nearly $400 billion by fiscal 1999, far outpacing the
projected $367 billion growth in tax revenues. (Congressional Budget
Office, An Economic and Budget Outlook, August 1994, p. 31.) This
means that the federal deficit, after dipping slightly next year to
$162 billion, will again begin to climb. By fiscal 1999, projects CBO,
the deficit will hit $231 billion and reach nearly $400 billion by
fiscal 2004. If last year's deficit reduction plan -- which contained
the largest tax increase in history -- worked as its supporters have
claimed, this should not be happening. This upward trend certainly
makes it likely that politicians once again will have to ask taxpayers
to bear higher taxes in order to meet Washington's insatiable appetite
for spending.
   <P>  The persistent growth of government should be reversed by using
the savings achieved by substantial cuts in government spending to
finance tax cuts for families with children. Such a strategy would
shift resources away from government and back to taxpayers, not from
one group of taxpayers to another.
 <P>    Second, linking cuts in spending directly to cuts in family taxes
gives taxpayers a financial stake in the budget process and, thus, an
incentive to counter the advocates of government programs. Such a
strategy can sugar-coat the political "pain" of spending cuts,
lessening the opposition of special interests who benefit from federal
largess. Absent the reward of a $500-per-child tax cut, few taxpayers
would bother to lobby for spending cuts because, under normal
circumstances, few perceive any tangible benefit from cuts in federal
spending. However, the advocates of, say, a $1 billion federal program
do have a serious financial interest in maintaining that spending and
are willing to invest considerable resources in lobbying to convince
Members of Congress not to cut the program.
  <P>   But these political dynamics change when spending cuts are linked
to tax cuts. Politicians who are accustomed to viewing spending cuts
only in terms of the pain they inflict on certain interest groups can
now see them in terms of the large number of families helped by those
cuts. For example, the savings achieved by eliminating a $1 billion
federal program are sufficient to finance a $500-per-child tax cut for
2 million American families. Thus, the constituency that stands to
benefit from elimination of the program is far larger than the number
of those who stand to lose. If Members of Congress enacted a $500-per-
child tax cut for every working family in America, they would empower
60 million advocates of spending cuts to stand up to Washington's
special interests.
<P>
<B> All Tax Cuts Are Local</B>
 <P>    Even the most pro-family Member of Congress may be reluctant to
cut spending in order to finance tax cuts. This is because Members
like to take political credit for "bringing home the bacon,"
demonstrating to voters back home how effective they are in looking
out for the interests of their congressional districts. With every
federal road project, research grant, and construction contract,
Members issue press releases announcing how many jobs will be created
or how many constituents will benefit from this infusion of federal
funds. For many Members of Congress, cutting taxes for families may
not appear to lend itself to such credit-taking.
   <P>  This impression is mistaken. Based on Census Bureau data,
Heritage Foundation analysts have calculated the total dollar value of
a $500-per-child tax credit for every state and congressional
district. These figures are contained in the Appendix to this paper
(county data are available upon request). While the number in each
congressional district varies greatly, the average district has
117,000 children. At $500 per child, this means the average district
will receive nearly $59 million in family tax relief each year.
   <P>  It is difficult to imagine that any single federal spending
project of similar magnitude could benefit as many constituents at the
same time. Thus, the political advantages of family tax relief would
more than seem to outweigh the political disadvantages of cutting
federal spending.
<P>
<B> CONCLUSION</B>
 <P>    The good news for millions of hard-working American families is
that there is growing bipartisan talk of cutting taxes for families
with dependent children. The bad news for the same families is that
this talk may not turn into action. Congress and the White House
should commit themselves now to enacting a $500-per-child tax credit
in next year's budget. 
 <P>    Such a measure would bring financial stability to the parents of
52 million American children, eliminating the entire federal tax
burden for 4.7 million working families. Nearly 86 percent of the
children eligible for this credit live in families with gross annual
incomes below $75,000, middle-class by any standard. For the typical
family of four, a $500-per-child tax credit would mean a 10 percent
cut in the overall federal tax burden. Finally, family tax relief is
good politics. Families in the typical congressional district would
receive roughly $59 million per year in tax relief, effectively
creating a powerful constituency for cutting wasteful government
spending. 
   <P>  Embattled American families do not need "investment" spending or
new social programs to improve their well-being. Such government
assistance has done little or nothing to help families, and paying for
more government programs only increases their tax burden. The best way
for the federal government to strengthen families and assist parents
in their vital role of raising the next generation of Americans is to
reduce their tax burden.

 <B> APPENDIX </B><P>
     Based on Census Bureau data, Heritage Foundation scholars have
calculated the total value of a $500-per-child tax credit for each
state and congressional district.
<P>     Nationally, there are nearly 51 million children eligible for
such a credit. Thus, in the first year of the plan, nearly $25.5
billion would be returned to American families. These results are
summarized in the first table in this appendix.
  <P>   While the number of children in each congressional district
varies greatly, the average district has 117,000 children. At $500 per
child, this means the average district will receive some $58.7 million
in family tax relief each year. The second table lists the
congressional districts by state. Included in the table are: the
number of eligible children in the district, the total amount of money
the district will receive in family tax relief, and the name of the
member representing the district.
<P>     Heritage analysts also have calculated the value of the $500-per-
child tax credit for every county in the U.S. These data are available

<P>

<hr>
<P>
 After you finally completed your income tax return last April
and mailed it off, you may have needed to get away for a few days.
 So you may have decided to spend a few nights at your favorite
getaway.  What you probably didn't realize was how much you were
<a href="/atr/tax-presentation/hotloped.html">paying in taxes again</a> when you paid your hotel bill.
<P>
 The consumer generally must pay a state sales and use tax on
the hotel room of about 7%.  Local occupancy taxes charge another
6%.  This means the consumer directly pays at least 13% of the
cost of a hotel room in taxes.
<P>
 But that is just the beginning.  Out of the amount the consumer
pays to the hotel, the hotel must pay Federal income taxes, state
income taxes, Federal payroll taxes, sales taxes, capital gains
taxes, unemployment insurance taxes, workmen's compensation taxes,
business license taxes and fees, utility taxes, local property
taxes, and any local income taxes.  The hotel must also pay Federal
and state excise taxes on its telephones.
<P>
 Altogether, these taxes average about 30% of the price of a hotel
room.  Counting the taxes paid directly by the consumer, this
means about 43% of what you pay for a hotel room goes to the government
in taxes rather than for the room.  Out of an average price for
hotel rooms of $80 per night, this means about $34.40 goes for
taxes.  Everything that goes into building and maintaining the
hotel room is paid for by the 57% of the rate charged to the consumer,
or about $45.60 on average, remaining after taxes are paid.
<P>
 A number of jurisdictions impose additional taxes on hotel guests
as well.  This includes a nightly utility tax, a liquor excise
tax, and a food and beverage tax.  A telephone excise tax is also
charged on the use of all phones.
<P>
 These taxes are unfair to workers.  In a democracy, taxes should
not be hidden in the prices of products people buy.  They should
be explicit and clear, so that voters can determine whether they
think those taxes are worth what they are getting from their government.
<P>
 Thomas Jefferson wrote, &quot;Government should not take out
of the mouth of labor the bread that it has earned.&quot;  But
that is exactly what our greedy and overreaching government does
today.  It taxes you on your income when you earn it, and taxes
it again when you spend it, and taxes you over and over again
along the way.  As a result, the average family today actually
pays more in taxes than on food, clothing, and shelter combined.
<P>
 Tax relief for working people is long overdue.  Such tax reduction
would give workers more control over their own incomes and economic
future.  A major tax reduction would also greatly stimulate the
economy, leading to more jobs, higher wages, and expanded economic
opportunity and prosperity.
<P>

<LI>Cut capital gains tax rate from 28% to 14%.  In 1992, 56%
of capital gains were from households with incomes of $50,000
or less.  Households with less than $100,000 income accounted
for 83% of the returns reporting capital gains.
<LI>Repeal the 1993 tax hike on Social Security benefits.  Due
to the 1993 Clinton tax increase on Social Security, 85% of Social
Security benefits became subject to federal taxation.  Retiree
incomes as low as $34,000 saw their taxes on Social Security benefits
rise.
<LI>American Dream Savings Accounts.  These accounts would expand
IRA's.  They would allow after-tax contributions and earn interest tax-free.
 They would also allow penalty-free withdrawals to help finance a first home, pay for
college expenses, or defray medical costs.  
<LI>IRA's for spouses who choose to stay at home.  A $2,000 per
year contribution can be 
put into an IRA on behalf of a spouse who works at home.
<LI>Education Investment Accounts.  These accounts allow up to
$500 per child per year to be put into tax-free account.  Parents who placed $500 per
year into the account would accrue $18,689 tax-free after 18 years.

<UL>
<LI>America is experiencing the slowest expansion in 100 years.
 The Clinton expansion is averaging 2.4% growth - not exactly
the best economy in the last 30 years.  The last five expansions
produced average growth rates of 4.4%.  The Reagan expansion during
the 1980's averaged over 5% growth.
<LI>Tax Freedom Day is now the latest ever.  The day Americans
work until to pay their share of federal taxes is now May 7, the
latest it's ever been.
<LI>Cost of Government day now July 3.  In 1996 Americans worked
until July 3 to earn enough money to pay off all direct and
hidden taxes (total federal, state, local government spending
plus the cost of regulation).
<LI>Real Median Household Income lower during Clinton than the
previous decade.  From 1983 to 1992, real median household income
was $33,119.  Under Clinton, it shrunk to $32,153.
<LI>Federal, State, and Local taxes account for 38% of a family's
budget (more than food, clothing, and health care combined). 
Today 26% of a family's budget goes to federal taxes, 12% to state
and local taxes, while 9% goes to food, 4% is spent on clothing,
and 10% goes for medical care.
<LI>Worker's real hourly wages have gone down under Clinton.  Bill
Clinton, the alleged protector of the working man, has presided
over a .4% drop in real hourly wages.  Wages went up 5.6% during
the decade before Clinton.  <BR>

<CENTER><B>How to Balance the Budget with the Dole Tax Cut</B></CENTER>
<P>
The economic plan of Republican Presidential nominee Robert
Dole promises to enact a major tax reduction plan and to balance
the Federal budget by 2002.  Some have argued that the lost revenue
from the tax cut plan would make balancing the budget by 2002
impossible.  The following facts show that this is untrue.
<UL>
<LI>Even counting the reduced tax revenues from the Dole tax cut
plan, the budget can be  balanced by 2002 by holding the growth
in government spending to 2.1% per year.  This is only slightly
less than the rate of increase in Federal spending since 1992,
which has been 2.4%.
<LI>Between now and 2002, the Federal government would spend $10.8
trillion overall under current law.  Counting the reduced revenue
from the Dole tax cut plan, the Federal budget can be balanced
by 2002 while still spending $10.2 trillion between now and then.
<LI>Counting the reduced revenue from the Dole tax cut plan, the
budget can be balanced by 2002 if the government spends just 4%
less than it now plans to spend between now and then.
<LI>Counting the reduced revenue from the Dole tax cut plan, the
budget can be balanced by 2002 while increasing annual Federal
spending by 14% by that year compared to this year.  Under current
law, annual Federal spending will be 20% larger by 2002 compared
to today.

	Cost of Government Day is the date of the calendar year, counting from January  1, that Americans have earned enough money to pay off the  total financial burden of government, including all state and federal spending and  regulatory costs.<P>
	The money we send to the government on April 15th is only the visible tip of a much larger iceberg.  Politicians have learned to circumvent the watchful eye of anti-tax voters by enacting hidden taxes--regulationsand government mandates.  Costly government programs, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and family leave legislation, do not show up in the federal or state budgets.  But they do cost money.<P>
 	This year, every American taxpayer will work until July 3rd--more than half way through the  year--to pay off his or  her share of government imposed financial costs. The total cost of government in 1996 is estimated at
 $3.38 trillion. That's $13,000 for every man, woman and child in 
America. Of this total, nearly $1 trillion results from federal and
state regulation. The federal government is responsible for more than
 $739 million in hidden regulatory taxes this year alone. That's more
 than $2,800 for every man, woman and child in America.<P>

*Leap Year makes TFD, SFD, and COGD appear one day earlier
<UL>
<LI>1  Based on Tax Foundation figures
<LI>2  SFD measures the cost of total government outlays (taxes plus borrowing)
<LI>3  COGD incorporates total (federal, state, and local) government expenditures, federal regulatory costs, and state workers' compensation and tort law costs.  COGD data is based on information compiled by Americans for Tax Reform Foundation from data in the President's January 1996 budget baseline; Thomas D. Hopkins, "Costs of Regulation:  Filling the Gaps" (report prepared for the Regulatory Information Service Center, Washington, D.C.), August 1992; "Tort Cost Trends; An International Perspective" (report prepared by the Tillinghast Company), 1992; and independent data provided by the Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis.</UL><P>






<FONT SIZE=+1><BOLD><a name="DEFINITION">Introduction to Cost of Government Day
</a></BOLD></FONT><P>
<BOLD>Definition</BOLD><BR>
Cost of Government Day is the day of the calendar year, counting form January 1, on which the average American worker has earned enough in gross income to pay off his or her federal, state, and local government-imposed financial obligations--total spending plus the cost of regulation.<P>

<BOLD>Methodology</BOLD><BR>
The cost of government is determined by adding the figures for government spending (all federal, state, and local outlays) and an estimate of the cost of government regulations.  A 1992 report prepared for the Regulatory Information Service Center by Rochester Institute of Technology Professor Thomas D. Hopkins provided the framework for determining the cost of regulations.  His figures were updated to include the cost of new regulations from information provided by economist Dr. Robert Genetski and estimates by Cost of Government Day director Alan Philp.  State workers' compensation and tort costs were included in the COGD figure as well, from information provided in a report produced by the Tillinghast Company.

<BOLD>What COGD Does/Does Not Include:</BOLD><BR>
<UL>
<LI>  All federal, state, and local outlays (taxes plus borrowing) are included in COGD.
<LI>  Most federal regulations are incorporated.  Exceptions include costs associated with minimum wage laws and anti-trust laws.
<LI> At the state level, only workers' compensation and tort costs  are incorporated.  Costs associated with state and local environmental protection, worker safety, and consumer protection are not included.  These costs, which are not included because the measurements cannot readily be quantified and broken out, can be substantial.
<LI> Indirect costs of regulation--resources diverted from other activities (e.g., decreased time with families, less leisure time) -- are not included.  Compliance costs, paperwork costs, and transfer costs are included.</UL></p>




<BOLD>Overview of the Cost of Government</BOLD><BR>
 
<P>
 <UL>
<LI> Cost of Government Day has moved forward for three straight years due to (1)sharp cuts in defense spending, (2)the defeat of Bill Clinton's government take-over of the health care system, and (3)a lessening in the number of major new regulations.  Had the Clinton health care plan passed, Cost of Government Day would have moved back approximately 30 days.  Americans would be working for the government an additional month.
<LI>  Because the 1996 House Republican budget became law, at least in 
part , Cost of Government Day came earlier than in 1995.  By 2000, Cost of Government Day will arrive at least 11 days earlier than scheduled under the Clinton plan.
<LI>  By 2002, the GOP budget will make Cost of Government Day arrive at least 17 days earlier than scheduled under the Clinton plan.  (This figure does not include additional savings from proposed Republican regulatory and legal reforms.)
<LI>  Republican legal reforms, if passed, will help rein in soaring civil justice costs, which now consume $300 billion per year, according to Citizens for a Sound Economy.<P></ul>





<A NAME="Facts About Regulation"><bold><font size=+1>Facts About Regulation</font><br>
Quantifying the Costs<bold><p>

<bold>Regulation Costs Jobs.</bold>  Economists Michael Hazilla and Raymond J. Kopp concluded that environmental regulations alone had by 1990 reduced the overall employment level by 1.18 percent.  According to economist Bill Laffer, that translates into 1.1 million to 1.4 million fewer jobs.  Laffer estimates the cost of all federal regulations numbers between 3.6 million and 9.6 million jobs.<br>

Kopp, "Social Cost of Environmental Quality Regulations:  A General Equilibrium Analysis," Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 98, No. 4 (1990), p.869; and William G. Laffer, "How Regulation is Destroying American Jobs," The Heritage Foundation:  16 February 1993, pp.6-7.</ADDRESS><p>

<bold>The Costs of Affirmative Action:</bold><br>
A projection based on a Forbes magazine model finds that the direct compliance costs of affirmative action programs cost the nation $25 billion per year.  But indirect costs -- paperwork, loss of efficiency, etc. -- could exceed $100 billion per year, according to the study.  According to the Congressional Research Service, about 160 federal programs, statutes, regulations, and executive orders grant some measure of "preference" to women or minorities in the areas of hiring, federal contracts, educational opportunities and grants.<br>

<bold>Losses to Farmers:</bold></br>
The American Farm Bureau  Federation estimates that U.S. agricultural interests spend between $18 billion and $20 billion per year complying with federal regulations.  To put things in perspective, that figure is roughly 35 percent of total net farm income in the United States.  If this estimate is in the ballpark, farmers spend $2 complying with government-mandated regulations for every $1 they receive in price supports.<br>
<ADDRESS>Source:  Thad Cochran, "Regulatory Relief for Farmers," The Washington Times, April 4, 1995.</ADDRESS><p>

<bold>The Cost of Cleanliness:</bold><br>
According to the U.S. Commerce Department, pollution abatement and control expenditures consumed more than 18 percent of gross private domestic nonresidential investment in 1992, or $102 billion.  Over the past 20 years, U.S. businesses have been forced to divert almost 15 percent of their total fixed investment to nonproductive equipment.<br>
<ADDRESS>Source:  Bruce Bartlett, "The High Cost of Turning Green," The Wall Street Journal, September 14, 1994.</ADDRESS><p>

<bold>Automobile Prices:</bold><br>
The cost of emissions-control equipment added to a new car through the 1994 model year averages $2010, according to data supplied by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and corrected to 1993 dollars.  Californians face a major dilemma in the coming years.  Regulators there have issued quotas of zero-emissions cars that they must build and sell, starting with 2 percent of the vehicles sold in California in 1998, then rising to five percent in 2001, and to 10 percent in 2003 and beyond.  This regulation promises almost no discernible benefits.  Every new car sold in the state today is 97% clean.  Most smog is produced by the dirtiest 10% of cars.  The 100 percent clean cars will replace the 97 percent clean cars, not the worst polluters.<br>

<bold>The Price Tag:</bold><br>
Government regulators regularly under-estimate the true cost of their proposed regulations.  The <ADDRESS>Federal Register</ADDRESS>  estimated that obtaining a stormwater discharge permit under the Clean Water Act would cost $76,681.  Gregory S. Lashutka, mayor of Columbus, Ohio, reports that his city's actual cost was $1.5 million.<br>

Smoking Regulations:</bold><br>
In what is estimated will cost $8.1 billion in the first year alone, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has marching order to go out and require restaurants, retailers, office buildings owners, and others to inspect and maintain their indoor ventilation systems and ban cigarette smoking unless it takes place in separately ventillated rooms.  Government regulators have launched a crusade to stamp out smoking, based on "studies" showing secondhand smoke to be a health menace.  But the 1.19 risk ration for intensive, 40 year, day-in-day-out, pack-a-day exposure to secondhand smoke is by virtually all measures insignificant.<br><ADDRESS>Source:  Susan Eckerly, "Seeking a Regulatory Respite," The Washington Times, February 12, 1995; and Jerry Taylor, "Cancer Risks for Thee, but Not for Me," The Wall Street Journal, January 3, 1995.</ADDRESS><p>

<bold>Water Quality Standards:</bold><br>
In March, the EPA's Great Lakes Initiative imposed uniform standards for water quality on eight different states (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin).  A study conducted for the Council of Great Lakes Governors says this will cost more than $2 billion per year and destroy up to 33,000 jobs.<br>
<ADDRESS>Source:  Susan Eckerly, "Seeking a Regulatory Respite," The Washington Times, February 12, 1995.</ADDRESS><p>

<bold>Air Pollution Standards:</bold><br>
Californians face $4 to $6 billion more to federal air quality regulatory costs each year.  Environmental Protection Agency regulators are marching into Los Angeles, Sacramento, and Ventura to enforce compliance with the 1977 Clean Air Act.  The state of California estimates that by 2010, "losses will total at least $8.4 billion in direct costs, $17.2 billion in output, and 165,000 jobs."<br>
<ADDRESS>Source:  Susan Eckerly, "Seeking a Regulatory Respite," The Washington Times, February 12, 1995.</ADDRESS><p>

<bold>Ethanol:</bold><br>
Bill Clinton frequently chooses to use regulatory dictates to reward favorite industries and constituencies.  Bowing to the powerful corn lobby, Clinton last year adopted the so-called ethanol rule, guaranteeing ethanol a 30 percent share of the oxygenate market for the reformulated gasoline program.  Ethanol is typically more expensive than its alternative, an ether known as MTBE.  Clinton's ethanol mandate was on track to cost consumers as much as $350 million per year at the gasoline pump (on top of his gas tax) and would have deprived the National Highway Trust Fund of millions of dollars of revenues because ethanol is partially tax exempt.  In April, 1995, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals delivered Clinton at least a temporary setback, ruling Clinton exceeded his authority with the ethanol mandate.<br>

<bold>The ADA's Legal Quagmire:</bold><br>
By December, 1994, nearly 40,000 complaints were filed under the Americans with Disabilities Act.  But mounting evidence suggests massive abuse.  Eighty-five percent of complaints came from people who had jobs, one-fifth of complaints came from people with back trouble, and nearly 12 percent from those with emotional or psychiatric impairments.  These figures suggest a large amount of administrative and legal activity for an apparently modest return, considering that Congress intended to design an incentive-based approach to broadening opportunities for the disabled.<br><ADDRESS>Source:  Claudia Winkler, "Reality Check on ADA's Results," The Washington Times, April 20, 1995.</ADDRESS><p>
<bold>FDA Tyranny:</bold><br>The Food and Drug Administration will soon require food manufacturers to notify the FDA before marketing foods manufactured with new biotech techniques -- high precision recombinant DNA, or gene splicing techniques.  This move reflects a two-year trend at the FDA toward stricter scrutiny of biotech products, relying more on "risk considerations" than real science.<br><ADDRESS>Source:  Henry Miller, "Dr. Kessler's Regulatory Obsessions," The Washington Times, December 15, 1994.</ADDRESS><p>

<bold>Banks Lose:</bold><br>
The American Bankers Association estimates that Bill Clinton's new "community reinvestment" requirements for banks will add more than $150 million in administrative costs to the industry.<br><ADDRESS>Source:  John Merline, "How Clinton Will Regulate U.S.," Investor's Business Daily, April 19, 1994.</ADDRESS></p>

In Sacramento, California, residents are reeling over a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ruling last fall which added three varieties of the fairy shrimp to th endangered species list.  The agency relied upon a one-paragraph petition submitted by a Davis, Calif., botanist in 1990, even though millions of the hardy shrimp can be found in California, Europe, Asia, Australia and Africa.  The decision has shut down a pony ranch that housed a Sacramento program for needy and disabled children and could cost the Sacramento-area housing industry $550 million.<br>

Pushing forward with the next stage of the 1990 Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has created a new paperwork nightmare for companies in high smog urban areas called the Employee Commute Option (ECO).  Employers in these regions are forced to find ways to cajole a designated percentage of their workers into carpools -- or face devastating financial penalties that can reach as high as $25,000 per violation.  Eric Peters, an automotive writer for <ADDRESS>The Washington Times</ADDRESS> observes that "the real genius of the ECO mandate is that it turns employers -- not the government or the EPA -- into the bullyboy."

The EPA also announced new emissions standards for marine engines, one of the last unregulated emissions sources.  Since marine engines are responsible for only about three percent of total emissions, the new standards are unlikely to have any noticeable effect on air quality.  But consumers will notice.  The high-performance, fuel-injected marine engines necessary to comply with the mandate can cost $1,200 (15%) more than conventional engines, a nationwide cost of as much as $300 million per year.<br>

Food and Drug Administration rules implemented by FDA head David Kessler are costing lives.  In 1991, Dr. Kessler prohibited pharmaceutical companies from informing doctors of new uses for approved drugs.  In one instance, the FDA stopped a pharmaceutical company from distributing free copies of "The Chemotherapy Source Book"--even though the company had already received FDA approval to give away thousands of copies.  The FDA claims that when a drug company gives doctors free textbooks that mention an off-label use of its products, the drugs become subject to seizure.<br><ADDRESS>Source:  James Bovard, "First Step to an FDA Cure:  Dump Kessler,"  The Wall Street Journal, December 8, 1994.</ADDRESS><p>

Bob Floyd of Muncie, Ind., had a "wetland" mysteriously appear on his property when a local business accidentally cut a drainage pipe.  Federal regulators swooped in to protect this "wetland" and forced the 80-year-old farmer to stop farming.  The so-called wetland has since dried up, but Mr. Floyd may have to sell the land his family has farmed for a half century.

Bob Lindberg, president of Young Co. in Seattle, thought his small metal firm had a decent diversity record -- with a work force that included about 35 percent women and minorities -- until the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) came knocking on his door.  The agency accused the firm, which is a subcontractor for a company that supplies anchors to the Navy, of a number of charges including failing to hire qualified Asian applicants.  Young opened his books to the auditors, spent thousands of dollars on a consultant, and finally settled in part by paying $47,000 in back wages to some minority workers.<br>

John Thorpe's plans to build on his own property were thwarted by the Fish and Wildlife Service, which demanded to know what steps he had taken to preserve the salt marsh harvest mouse.  Though Mr. Thorpe only wanted to develop mostly on the dry, upland portion of his propery, an agency of the U.S. government theorized that when golboal warming melts the polar ice-caps, the Pacific will rise and inundate the habitat of the salt marsh harvest mouse on his lowlands, forcing it to seek refuge on Thorpe's highlands.  For this science fiction story, Thorpe was denied permission to develope his land.<br>

Richard Enthoven's family-owned Kwik Wash Laundries Inc. in Dallas says it is facing damage claims totaling more than $2 million in two suits.  In a high-crime neighborhood in San Antonio three years ago, a man was murdered near the entrance of one apartment building launderette, where he was washing a friend's clothes at about 2 a.m.  E.B. Barretto, the attorney representing the victim's father, alleges that Kwik Wash failed to provide adequate security at its launderette.  He further claims a security light was out and Kwik Wash violated the apartment building's safety guidelines, which called for closing the launderette at 10 p.m.<br>

In an example of the lawsuit frenzy borne of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act, in July, 1992, GTE Data Services in Tampa discovered that one of its computer programmers had been stealing money from other employees and had brought a loaded derringer to work.  When he was fired for having the gun, he sued for reinstatement under the ADA.  He said he was the victim of a mental illness aggravated by improper medication , and thus disabled under the language of the act.  The first court ruling - later overturned -- went in the programmer's favor:  "When poor judgment is a sympton of a mental or psychological disorder, it is defined as an impairment that would qualify as a disability under the ADA," the court said.

David and Florence Isbell -- well known in activist legal circles in Washington -- teamed up with the Washington Lawyers' Committee to force Washington area theaters to install special assistive listening devices.  Cineplex theaters, the unfortunate target of the Isbell's crusade, had been installing the equipment in theaters around the nation when the Isbell's filed suit.  In response, Cineplex accelerated the installation plan for the Washington area and had all theaters equipped by August 31.  Thinking the problem had been solved, Cineplex asked the U.S. District court to dismiss the suit.  The lead attorney for the Washington Lawyers' Committee refused to back down.  Cineplex ageed to pay $60,000 in attorneys' fees and accept the supervision of a court appointed monitor.  Howard Lichtman, executive vice president of the Cineplex chain, says the rate of requests for the devices "is infinitesimal."

When a club at the East Brunswick Condominium Association in New Jersey set aside some swimming pool hours exclusively for adults, the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department swept in, alleging a violation of the Fair Housing Act for discrimination against children.  For this transgression, the association was obligated to pay $3,000 in compensatory damages, enroll its employees in nondiscrimination training, and report its policies to the Justice Department for the next four years.<br>

The Republican Congress should set specific goals for the movement of Cost of Government Day.  Specifically, legislators should target a Cost of Government Day 1996 on or before July 4th, so that Americans can truly enjoy their liberation from the government on Independence Day.  Likewise, Congress should aim for a Cost of Government Day 2005 on or before April 15th so Americans can truly enjoy the fruits of the labor by the time they file their taxes.<p>

Heighten public attention about "bureaucratic tyranny" by establishing a monthly "Corrections Day" and holding public "show trials" of wasteful government programs and abusive regulations.  "Corrections Day," as dubbed by Speaker Gingrich, would help stem "self-evidently stupid," "profoundly dumb," "stupidly legal" and "silly" regulations flowing from federal agencies.
<address><br>Source:  Kenneth Cooper, "Speaker is planning a Bash for Bureaucratic Boondoggles, "The Washington Post, May 3, 1995.</address><p>

Bar unelected federal bureaucrats from making laws.  Ultimately, no law should go into effect without the consent of a majority of the House, a majority of the Senate, and the signature of the President.  Lawmakers should take direct responsibility for laws by enacting them themselves.  Agency bureaucrats can make recommendations, conduct risk assessment, and propose legal language, but should not be allowed to make laws themselves.<br>

Reduce the number of government regulators.  From 1985 to 1992, staffing of federal regulatory agencies increased by over 20 percent.  By 1992, the federal government employed almost 125,000 regulatory employees, and that total has increased under Bill Clinton.  One way Congress can reduce "bureaucratic tyranny," as Speaker Gingrich has described it, is by reducing the number of government regulators.  Too often, regulators seek to justify their own existence by implementing time consuming and overly bureaucratic mandates on state and local governments and private businesses. <p> Congress should send regulators a message:  Overzealous regulatory behavior will be punished, not rewarded.  State and local governments must follow suit.  During the 1980's, state-level bureaucracies increased by almost 20 percent.  Whereas the federal government employes about two million civilian employees, state and local governments employ more than six times that amount.<br>
<address>Source:  Jonathan Adler, "On a High Regulatory Roll,"  The Washington Times, April 4, 1994.</address><p> 

Demand proper risk assessment of all proposed regulations.  Government regulators are notorious for devoting huge resources to relatively insignificant risks -- like asbestos exposure in schools -- at tremendous cost to companies and consumers.  For example, look at EPA's risk assessment for a Superfund site.  You will learn about hypothetical children who eat dirt 250 days a year from the bottom of contaminated brooks and ponds.  Likewise, the Safe Drinking Water Act mandates that local governments get rid of virtually all chloroform in their water, even though the best available science suggests that chloroform does not pose a danger in the biological mechanisms associated with drinking tap water.  Risk assessment should quantify the cost of all proposed regulations and rank risks in order of priority.  Target risks should be compared to several ordinary risks that people confront in their daily lives.  In addition, regulators should be required to consider competing risks -- dangers induced by regulators.  For example, Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards requiring "fuel efficient" automobiles are resulting in smaller, less safe cars and more deaths and injuries on the road.<br>

Enact a federal regulatory budget.  Such a budget would establish a maximum total regulatory burden that government could impose on the economy.  Any new regulations that would exceed the budget based on risk assessment reports would require the repeal or modification of some other regulations to ensure regulatory burden neutrality.<br>

Overhaul the Clean Air Act and allow states to use remote-sensing detectors to identify high-emission vehicles.  Just 10 percent of the cars on the road produce half of all hydrocarbons.  But current law subjects the 90 percent of clean auto owners to cumbersome, expensive, time-consuming, bureaucracy-intensive mandates such as inspections, reformulated gasolines, car-pooling requirements, alternative fuels, and even soon-to-be mandated production of inefficient electric cars in California.  Remote-sensing technology can identify dirt cars, reducing the role of government and freeing most auto-owners from bureaucratic harassment.<br>

Reform the 1974 Clean Water Act to specifically and reasonably define what constitutes a wetland.  Under current rules, federal regulators have construed the Clean Water Act to classify huge tracts of land as wetlands for protection from development, even though the 1974 statute says nothing about welands protection.  Bipartisan legislation sponsored by Rep. Bud Shuster calling on the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Agriculture to classify all existing welands based on function and environmental importance into categoies A (high priority), B (modest priority) and C (low priority)  would put an end to egregious bureaucratic regulatory "takings" from private land-owners.<br>

Provide for proper enforcement of the Fifth Amendment's "takings" clause.  Landowners should be compensated for all substantial reductions in their property values which result from enforcement of federal, state, or local regulatory statutes.<br>

Repeal the Delaney Clause, a provision of the 1958 Food Drug and Cosmetic Act that allows only additives deemed to have zero risk of causing cancer to be used on processed foods.  Passed at a time when cancer risks were far more difficult to determine, the statute is grossly outdated at best and an example of hyper-regulatory overkill at worst.<br>

Enact Long-awaited Banking Reform.  Existing banking laws -- largely incorporated in the 1930's-era Glass-Seagall Act -- are woefully outdated, sharply restricting or prohibiting the ability of banks to expand across state lines, sell insurance, or provide investment underwriting.  As a result, American banks are at a tremendous disadvantage in the world market.  Congress should repeal antiquated laws such as the Glass-Seagall Act and promote competition in the American banking industry.  A recent McKinsey & Co. study found that the annual costs of interstate banking under today's cumbersome regulatory structure can range from .5 percent to almost one percent of a company's noninterest expenses -- a total in the billions of dollars.  And these savings are dwarfed by those that will come from the nationwide consolidations of operations.

Repeal market regulations on telecommunications providers.  The long distance and local telephone markets, as well as the cable television market, should be opened up to competition.  Current law, based on the 1934 Communications Act based on 19th century railroad regulation, imposes restrictions which ensure virtual monopolies in existing phone and cable markets.  These antiquated regulations should come to an end, and the cable-telco ban, which prevents telephone and cable firms from competing against each other, should be repealed.  Competition between long distance and local phone companies and cable television providers will reduce prices and ensure better service for consumers.  The 1992 Cable Act should be repealed.

Enact Civil Justice Refomr.  The more than 70,000 product liability lawsuits filed in the United States each year cost Americans $300 billion per year, according to Citizens for a Sound Economy.  It's no wonder 47 percent of U.S. firms in a recent survey said they had withdrawn products from the market over fear of lawsuits.  Congress must pass comprehensive legal reform, including partial institution of a "loser-pays" rule to encourage settlements, a cap on "pain-and-suffering" awards in all civil suits, higher standards of proof for punitive damages in all civil suits, and limits on the liability of manufacturers.<br>

States around the country have been forced to reform their budgeting and tax policies due to their deficit spending.  Many states have been successful in trimming their deficits without raising taxes.  The method used by the most successful states has been supermajority tax limitation laws and spending limitation laws. <b>One third of all Americans live in a state withe supermajority constitutional tax limitations.  In most of the states supermajority requirements, the idea of requiring a greater than fifty percent vote of the legislature to increase taxes grew out of the tax revolt movement and the initiative process.</b>  These states offer a successful model for the Federal Government's budget and tax reform efforts.  The following states have supermajority tax limitation requirements:

The Framers' decision not to impose additional constitutional supermajority requirements does not mean that they opposed extending the concept. It simply means that at the time of ratification they did not see a need for other supermajority requirements. However, they did recognize that circumstances change and that the Constitution would need to be flexible to change with the passage of time. Consequently, they provided a mechanism to amend the Constitutionan amendment mechanism that itself requires two supermajority voting requirements: Congressional adoption of the proposed amendment by a 2/3 supermajority and then approval by three-fourths of the states for ratification.
<p>
	Finally, a supermajority requirement for increasing the U.S. tax burden is not unprecedented. The 16th Amendment to the Constitution, which provides for the income tax, had to be approved by a vote of two-thirds of Congress and three-fourths of the states. It is only logical that we should extend this protection to increases of the tax burden that are far in excess of the small burden first imposed in 1913.airness Restoration Act" introduced by Texas Congressman and House Majority Leader Dick Armey.  Most people call it "the flat tax" for short.<P>

<P>

<DD>Candidates and elected officials began taking the pledge in 1986. After President Reagan's Tax Reform Act of 1986 was passed,
many taxpayers feared that some politicians would raise income tax rates. With President Reagan's support and endorsement,
Americans for Tax Reform and a broad-based coalition of groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National
Federation of Independent Businesses and hundreds of taxpayer groups throughout the nation began to ask all candidates for
public office to "take the pledge." Every year, all Members of Congress are asked to take the pledge by Americans for Tax
Reform, and all challengers are asked to take the pledge during each election cycle.

<h2><center><I><B>Individuals Who Save Get Third-Class 
Treatment Under The Ordinary Income Tax</h2></center></B></I>
<hr>
<P>
Our government rather freely provides loans to many foreign governments,
some of whom are (or were) communist, socialist, big government
central planners, dictators, or scoundrels.  Not infrequently,
these loans carry a zero rate of interest or a rate that's far
below market.  No collateral is required.
<P>
Many, if not most, of these loans are eventually written off as
defaults, severely written down, or rolled over with little prospect
for repayment.  In aggregate, these loans (and gifts or subsidies)
from our taxpayers' pockets amount to mega-billions of dollars
every year.
<P>
Contrast these loans, gifts, or subsidies to foreigners with the
refusal of our government to properly consider its own taxpayers'
IRA assets as representing private saving that will enhance the
government's tax revenues, not reduce them!
<P>
Rather than considering IRAs as an asset, the government treats
IRA tax deferrals as wasted spending; not unlike the writing off
of a governmental loan to, or subsidized trade with, Iraq, or
some socialist/communist country.
<P>
Completely ignored by the government are the facts that IRA assets:
 (a) are held in trust (by law) for the future payment of taxes;
(b) are invested in income-producing assets (not some foreign
government's and bureaucracy's boondoggle); (c) provide growing
amounts of capital for business enterprises and other productive
private uses, including jobs; (d) create ever-growing gains that
contribute to the economic growth of our nation; and (e) provide
tax revenue gains for our government.
<P>
It's amazing and most distressing to recognize how our government
freely gives away taxpayer money to foreigners (and then cavalierly
writes it off), while denying its taxpayers the eminently sound
financial structure of universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs,
so that all taxpayers will save more to produce more!  Taxing
saving &quot;twice&quot; or more is bad enough, but then giving
away those diminished tax receipts to fund foreign boondoggles
equals third-class or &quot;steerage&quot; treatment for U.S.
taxpayers who save and invest!
<P>
<I>It's time for all savers and investors to stand up and fight
for tax sanity and their financial well-being.</I>

<h1>With Liberty and Justice for All</h1>
<h2><i>Redefining the Educational Choice Debate</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>E</font>ducation is a so-called mixed good. It offers both 
public and private benefits. Thus, the debate over education policy in 
America is often cast as a clash between public and private interests,
a conflict between equity and liberty. In the words of social
scientist James Coleman:

<p><blockquote>

<i>[C]ontradictions . . . arise out of two simultaneously-held values
that are very relevant to most Americans. The first is the autonomy
and choice of parents to do all they can to raise their children
to adulthood. The second is the value we place on having a society
that is not fragmented by divisions imposed by segregated or exclusive
upbringing.</i>[1]

</blockquote><p>

Liberty and equity are not mutually-exclusive concepts. But if
their proper relationship is to be achieved, policymakers must
develop a new understanding of equal opportunity based on liberty.
Education policy in America today often fails to pay respect to
the need for parents to direct their children's upbringing. Indeed,
calls for parental choice in education typically run headlong
into the myth of the &quot;common school&quot; and the rhetoric
of &quot;equal opportunity&quot; -- outmoded ideas which the education
establishment successfully employs to protect its vested interest.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Paine believed that most poor<br>
parents were well aware of the<br>
benefits of education and that<br>
heavy taxation was the chief<br>
cause of their under-investment<br>
in education.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Thus, a gradual &quot;demythologizing&quot; of the common school
as the bulwark of democracy and the ultimate expression of equal
opportunity will be necessary to sustain any hope of expanding
private liberty (and improving student performance) through parental
choice in education. Otherwise, the political power of the teacher
unions and the philosophical tensions inherent in education will
continue to render choice an elusive goal.

<p>

<center><h3>No Paine, No Gain</h3></center>

<p>

Political theorists have long debated whether government should
be involved in education in any capacity. More than two centuries
ago, Thomas Jefferson made an eloquent case for a state role in
education in a letter to George Wythe:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Preach, my dear Sir, a crusade against ignorance, establish and
improve the law for educating the common people. Let our countrymen
know that the people alone can protect us against these evils,
and that the tax which will be paid for this purpose is not more
than the thousandth part of what will be paid to kings, priests
and nobles who will rise up among us if we leave the people in
ignorance.</i>[2]

</blockquote><p>

Interestingly, many of the classical economists who were busy
ardently defending laissez-faire economic policies in Jefferson's
day were also forceful advocates of a state role in education.
Adam Smith argued in <I>The Wealth of Nations</I> that the market
would fail to capture the social benefits of education because
of the divergence between public and private interests.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Mill's sympathy for government<br>
paternalism did not extend to<br>
justifying inefficient and<br>
inferior education in the name<br>
of broad public purposes.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

But Smith stopped short of issuing an unqualified endorsement
of state-sponsored education. Contrasting the quality of education
under public and private arrangement, Smith argued that private
schools were more successful in cultivating skills in reading,
writing and arithmetic.[3] While eager to promote the education of
all students, Smith did not share the conviction of Jeremy Bentham
and other utilitarians that government could successfully administer
education. Instead, he argued for a wide dispersal of educational
expenditure and decision-making to prevent teacher compensation
from being made independent of effort.

<p>

Similarly, Thomas Paine believed that most poor parents were well
aware of the benefits of education and that heavy taxation was
the chief cause of their underinvestment in education. Paine proposed
a much more far-reaching decentralization of authority that would
further increase parental freedom of choice and competition among
schools. In <I>The Rights of Man</I>, he proposed &quot;to make
a remission of taxes to every poor family out of the surplus taxes
. . . enjoining the parents of such children to send them to 
school.&quot;[4]

<p>

John Stuart Mill's writings on the question of state education
are ambiguous and at times self-contradictory because he, too,
was acutely aware of the tension between personal liberty and
the public purposes of education. On the one hand, Mill differed
from Paine. Mill believed that government must control education
because parents were incompetent to judge their children's best
interests. But in a moment of supreme doubt, he wrote: &quot;A
general State education is a mere contrivance for moulding [sic]
people to be exactly like one another. . . it establishes a despotism
over the mind.&quot;[5] Mill's enthusiasm for state schools, moreover,
depended on the assumption that the public schools would always
be superior to private institutions. He wrote in <I>On Liberty</I>
that a state school should exist, &quot;if it exist at all, as
one among many competing experiments, carried on for the purpose
of example and stimulus, to keep the others up to a certain standard
of excellence.&quot;[6] Mill's sympathy for government paternalism
did not extend to justifying inefficient and inferior education
in the name of broad public purposes.

<p>

In the earliest years of the Republic, parental fees provided
the majority of funding for schools, as Adam Smith and Thomas
Paine had recommended. As parents exercised their freedom to determine
the shape of their children's education, the great heterogeneity
of the nation expressed itself in the diversity and autonomy of
its local schools.

<p>

Nineteenth century reformers, however, launched a campaign to
redefine education as the means to restore morality, justice and
social conformity. A public-purpose rationale began to triumph
over respect for the private benefits afforded parents by the
freedom and genuine diversity in the schools. Under Horace Mann's
leadership, reformers succeeded in creating a system that was
&quot;bureaucratic and professional, designed to ensure, so the
story goes, that education would be taken out of politics and
placed in the hands of impartial experts devoted to the public
interest.&quot; It was the &quot;one best system,&quot; also referred
to as the &quot;common school.&quot;[7]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Over the last three decades,<br>
it has become increasingly<br>
evident that the public school<br>
is failing to fulfill its high-<br>
minded egalitarian purpose.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Egalitarian democracy was now operationally-defined as centrally-planned
uniformity, secured through bureaucratic arrangements. According
to education historian E.G. West, however, it was teachers and
government officials, not discontented parents, who brought about
the change.[8] And, as economist Milton Friedman has observed, it
was hardly an apolitical enterprise: &quot;Though the arguments
were all pitched in terms of the public interest, much of the
support of teachers and administrators for the public school movement
derived from a narrow self-interest,&quot; including greater control
over the schools and almost guaranteed salaries now that government
was the paymaster.[9] Friedman notes that reformers simply capitalized
on public sympathy for the concept of equal opportunity to succeed
in establishing universal, &quot;free&quot; and compulsory education.[10]
That same egalitarian impulse had already found private expression
in the form of charity schools and the adjustment of school fees
according to means, as West and other historians report.[11]

<p>

<center><h3>From Equity to Liberty</h3></center>

<p>

Over the last three decades, it has become increasingly evident
that the public school is failing to fulfill its high-minded egalitarian
purpose. Equity &quot;based on homogeneity has occurred only by
discriminating against some, segregating others, and denying the
possibilities of alternative ways of life.&quot;[12] Historian David
Cohen explains:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Education has long been seen as both the chief antidote to
poverty and the principal means for assimilating ethnic and racial
minorities. . . . Since [the late 1960s], however, events have
cast serious doubt on these two venerable articles of faith .
. . that education is the high road to equality or social 
integration.</i>[13]

</blockquote><p>

In 1966, Coleman released his now-famous Equality of Educational
Opportunity report, concluding that differences in the quality
of the nation's schools bear only a trivial relationship to differences
in the educational achievement of the nation's students. Coleman's
report posed a fundamental question: If schools have little effect
on differences in children's achievement, is state-controlled
public education the key to social justice?

<p>

At about the same time, empirical evidence of low academic performance
in the public schools caused Friedman to start repopularizing
criticisms of the &quot;common school&quot; first made by Smith,
Paine, and Mill. As an alternative, Friedman began calling for
educational vouchers that would give parents freedom of choice,
thereby increasing competitive supply. Given the ineffectiveness
of the present education system, he asked rhetorically, &quot;Wherein
are the 'neighborhood effects' that justify such use of tax 
money?&quot;[14]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

To broaden the base of potential support for vouchers, Friedman
took pains to argue that his proposal would actually enhance equality
of opportunity. Under the current system, he noted, wealthy families
have significantly more freedom of choice than low-income families.
Poor families are trapped in poor school districts. They lack
the resources to move or to choose private schools. &quot;Under
present arrangements, stratification of residential areas effectively
restricts the intermingling of children from decidedly different
backgrounds. . . . Our present system, far from equalizing opportunity,
very likely does the opposite.&quot;[15]

<p>

While Friedman questioned the practical interpretation of the
public purposes of education, he appealed primarily to a philosophical
commitment to individual liberty. &quot;Persuasive as [the] argument
[for achieving a common core of values] is, . . . [o]n grounds
of principle, it conflicts with the preservation of freedom itself,&quot;
he wrote.[16] Friedman suggested that the circumstances that justified
the definition of education as a predominantly public good in
the Progressive Era were eclipsed by circumstances that now favor
the definition of education as a private good.

<p>

While vouchers appealed to Friedman as a means to introduce the
efficiency of the market into education, liberal social analyst
Christopher Jencks embraced vouchers as a means to equalize opportunity
by improving the education of low-income and minority children.
Favoring egalitarian over libertarian goals, he designed a voucher
experiment for the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) in the
1960s that included heavy regulatory burdens governing admissions
policies, fiscal incentives for schools to accept poor students,
and the creation of an educational voucher agency to oversee the
program. The OEO voucher experiment demonstrated the problems
of policy design and political opposition that would hamper implementation
of educational choice even after changing philosophical definitions
had begun to broaden its appeal.

<p>

In most of the prospective test sites, local educators and grass-roots
organizations blocked Jencks' proposal. &quot;In effect, there
was no constituency for a plan that threatened the job security
of teachers [and] compromised the independence of private schools.&quot;[17]
Finally, the Alum Rock school district in California agreed to
the voucher demonstration; but, &quot;the process of negotiation
between federal sponsors and local interest groups resulted in
a dramatic alteration of the voucher plan. Ultimately, no private
schools participated . . . [and] [n]o teachers in unpopular programs
lost their jobs. In fact, none of the incentives usually thought
to spur initiative in the private sector were present in Alum
Rock.&quot;[18] Interestingly, Jencks and his associates concluded
that, &quot;if restrictions are too rigid, a voucher system is
likely to be indistinguishable from the present public school
system.&quot;[19] Conservatives argued that the regulations Jencks
himself proposed to satisfy equity requirements emasculated the
voucher concept, precluding an adequate test of educational choice.

<p>

The unregulated character of Friedman's proposals, however, still
posed too great a risk to liberal policymakers to win passage.
Writing at the time, education analyst Dennis Doyle observed:

<p><blockquote>

<i>The basic reason that policymakers will not support either
Jencks or Friedman vouchers is that the dimension of vouchers
that makes them interesting -- choice -- still threatens an egalitarian
society. At the present time only one important interest group
might change this, and that group is minorities in general, especially
[black Americans]. . . . [T]here is a growing body of minority
and black opinion which holds that choice itself is the key to
equality -- and that without choice, equal educational opportunity
will remain unfulfilled.</i>[20]

</blockquote><p>

Alum Rock proved to be an early sign of increasing national interest
in the concept of educational choice -- coupled with persistently
dubious prospects for political passage of any far-reaching voucher
proposal.

<p>

<center><h3>Toward a Philosophical Redefinition</h3></center>

<p>

As the limitations of the common school have grown increasingly
obvious and the case for educational choice more plausible, choice
opponents have clung more desperately to the &quot;myth of the
common school&quot; as a pluralist and apolitical institution.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>

families trapped in poor<br>
school districts.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

From the outset, a primary objective of the common school was
the socialization of all children in an overtly religious, yet
non-sectarian environment. Educator Charles Glenn's book <I>The
Myth of the Common School</I> portrays the movement toward state
education as a mission to acculturate immigrants into the predominantly
Protestant culture of 19th-century America. The religion of the
early common school was a least-common-denominator Christianity
tending toward the Unitarianism of the schools' founding fathers.
Central Protestant doctrines like sin, and salvation by faith
in Christ were expunged as committee review of curriculum and
teaching took hold, implanting a more muted religion of good and
evil, along with a hefty dose of strictly civic morality. Catholics,
Jews, and Lutherans, often the alien target of the common school
movement, found their beliefs discouraged and discounted as 
&quot;sectarian&quot; in the new schools. So began the tradition of 
&quot;publicly-sponsored orthodoxy,&quot; as long-time education observer 
Stephen Arons calls it, in which the government defines through the 
public schools a set of &quot;normative&quot; values and beliefs.[21]

<p>

But even genuine efforts to find common ground are of little avail,
for education is the very enterprise of discovering and defending
first principles. It cannot be replaced by some &quot;value-neutral&quot;
process. As Aristotle said, education is about teaching the young
to lead the good life. Since men disagree about what the good
life is, men disagree about education. Glenn muses that &quot;we
may have set ourselves an impossible task in seeking to provide
a single model of education that is to be at once capable of nurturing
character and civic virtue and yet inoffensive to the conviction
of any parent.&quot;[22] Reformers eager to employ the common school
as an agent of social change offend parents' beliefs all the more.

<p>

The socialization mission is a flat violation of families' First
Amendment freedoms of belief and expression, argues Arons. The
First Amendment, he believes, not only protects parents' freedom
to express their beliefs, but also to pass on those beliefs to
their children.[23] Yet, compulsory public education forces parents
to surrender these tender matters of conscience to the political
majority. Aron continues, &quot;The level of coercion required
to resolve these value conflicts would be inconsistent with personal
liberty and political democracy.&quot;[24] While some argue that private
schools provide an adequate escape hatch from the public schools,
Arons argues that requiring parents to purchase their First Amendment
freedoms is as crass as taxing voters to enter the polls.

<p>

Thus, he concludes: &quot;[T]he present structure of public education
is unconstitutional because the primary victims of the unequal
distribution of liberty are the poor, working people and racial
minorities.&quot;[25] The comment reflects a subtle but critically
important reframing of the equity debate. By defining equity as
more nearly an &quot;equality of liberty,&quot; Arons offers a
fledgling strategy to help temper sharp oscillations between liberty
and equity, or private and public purposes, in education.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>

as a predominantly public<br>
good in the Progressive era<br>

favor the definition of<br>
education as a predominantly<br>
private good.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

But Arons also casts specific doubt on the priority of the public
benefits of education: &quot;The legitimacy of the political consensus,
however weak, may be eliminated by government interference in
the process of belief and value formation.&quot;[26] Arons' searching
concern echoes the early 20th-century cautions of Princeton theologian
J. Gresham Machen that monopolistic state education would be &quot;the
most effective engine of tyranny and intellectual stagnation that
has yet been devised.&quot;[27] Machen argued that only competition
with private schools would keep the state schools healthy and
thus admonished a group of Christian school educators, &quot;May
the distinctiveness of your Christian schools never be lost; may
it never give place, by a false 'Americanization,' to a drab uniformity
which is the most un-American thing that could possibly be 
conceived!&quot;[28]

<p>

If coercion on matters of conscience results in further splintering
of communities, Arons seems to suggest government monopoly of
education may negate its public benefits altogether.

<p>

<center><h3>Are Vouchers the Right Mechanism?</h3></center>

<p>

If the argument for parental choice in education is based on the
philosophy of freedom from coercion, then the mechanism for choice
cannot be permitted to increase state coercion of parents or the
private sector.

<p>

Funding and regulation are the two defining characteristics of
public agencies, nearly always appearing hand in hand. The unhappy
results are dramatically evident in Canada, where some provinces'
religious and private schools are a part of the public school
system and receive state funding. Today many religious schools
depend heavily on subsidies from the Canadian government and have
subsequently lost their defining character.[29]

<p>

While voucher proponents originally made little distinction, today
they are careful to specify that voucher payments must flow directly
to parents or students -- not to private institutions. First Amendment
attorney William Bentley Ball argues that such precision is necessary
to sidestep potential entanglement problems.[30]

<p>

Nevertheless, many perceive the difference between aid to religious
institutions and aid to individuals to be only semantic and believe
vouchers do pose a threat to religious schools.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The threat of future tinkering with the language of such laws
should not be dismissed, according to education researcher Chester
Finn. &quot;Some [private schools] to be sure, like to think they...can
obtain aid without saddling themselves with unacceptable forms
of regulation. But most...are more or less resigned to amalgamating
or choosing between assistance and autonomy.&quot;[31]

<p>

In the current federal political landscape, the compromises necessary
to achieve a winning voucher proposal come at too dear a price
for many would-be supporters. In the recent debate over vouchers
for the District of Columbia, the political payoff for the key
support of centrist Sen. Jim Jeffords (R-Vt.) was the surrender
of the basic principle for which every true religious school exists:
the fusion of faith and learning. Jeffords demanded and won the
addition of two provisions regarding religion. The first established
a religious opt-in provision requiring written consent from parents
for students to participate in religious courses or activities.
The second was even more worrisome to friends of religious liberty,
mandating that no school could use the voucher money to pay for
its religious courses or activities. Given such provisions, James
Cardinal Hickey made it clear that schools of the Archiocese of
Washington, D.C. would not participate in the voucher program.
With Catholic schools totalling some 80 percent of the private
schools in the city, the D.C. voucher scenario was nearly a re-run
of Alum Rock.

<p>

<center><h3>Concerns Specific to Means-Tested Vouchers</h3></center>

<p>

Means-tested vouchers, in particular, suffer from several potentially
fatal flaws. Assessing social reforms in the 1970s, Irving Kristol
comments that &quot;[p]ractically all social reforms 'work' in
that they do distribute some benefits to the people whom they
aim to help.&quot;[32] Means-tested vouchers would very likely 
&quot;work&quot; to improve the educational prospects of a few low-income 
children -- perhaps even helping to mold the next Clarence Thomas. Kristol
quickly notes, however, that there are two problems inherent in
giving money only to the poor.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Today many religious schools in<br>
Canada have come to depend heavily<br>
on subsidies from the government<br>
and have subsequently lost their<br>
defining character.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The primary difficulty is that means-tested benefits always establish
a huge disincentive for families on the margin to escape the poverty
trap.

<p>

Moreover, Kristol argues that means-tested benefits do a
grave disservice to a society by establishing an arbitrary definition
of &quot;poor.&quot;

<p>

Social reform, in other words, should actively seek to minimize
class conflict by advancing low- and middle-income interests in
tandem. A recent column by William Raspberry of <I>The Washington
Post</I> confirms the perspicacity of Kristol's insight. &quot;The
recent political trend,&quot; Raspberry observes, &quot;is to
legislate luck for entire classes of people. Some get the breaks,
and some get suckered. . . .It isn't that Americans no longer
care about the common good, but that they have lost faith in mutuality.
They're afraid of being played for suckers.&quot;[33]

<p>

Both survey and anecdotal evidence suggest that school voucher
proposals may indeed be falling prey to class resentment over
policies that tax Reagan voters to bestow benefits on Clinton
backers. In the wake of the school choice defeat in California,
pollster Frank Luntz found that seven out of 10 Californians said
they do not favor exclusive targeting of lower-income students.
On the other hand, two-thirds of all California voters said that
they would be willing to support choice in education in the future
if it did not cost any additional tax money.[34]

<p>

Gene Piccolo of the Choice in Education League in Minnesota reports
voter concern over the potential of the pending voucher initiative
in his state to create a new entitlement. He also reports a subtle
but distinctive undertone of middle-class suburbanite resentment
among voucher opponents -- perhaps, he believes, because Minnesota
already boasts one of the highest levels of public welfare spending
in the country.

<p>

&quot;Publicly-funded compassion fatigue&quot; may render means-tested
vouchers a political non-starter in other parts of the country
as well. The success of the privately- funded voucher (or scholarship)
movement, by contrast, suggests that Americans are beginning to
draw a sharp distinction between &quot;compassion&quot; and government
solutions -- and between &quot;compassion&quot; and equality in
the egalitarian sense.

<p>

<center><h3>A New Look at Tax Credits</h3></center>

<p>

Given the failure to establish a full educational choice program
anywhere in the U.S. after nearly a quarter century, choice proponents
must challenge themselves to develop a new scheme. The proposal
should place a premium on liberty and on the private benefits
of education while reformulating the public-purpose rhetoric employed
by the education establishment. A new proposal should also avoid
the weaknesses associated with vouchers, including the menace
of government regulation, consistent challenges to their constitutionality,
dim prospects for political passage, the danger of expanding an
entitlement mentality and a narrow coalition of beneficiaries
to support passage. A refundable tax credit scheme is more likely
to overleap these hurdles than means-tested voucher demonstration
projects.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The more universal the private benefits, the more likely the U.S.
Supreme Court will be to uphold the proposal. In the 1983 case
<I>Mueller v. Allen</I>, the court held that a program &quot;that
neutrally provides state assistance to a broad spectrum of citizens
is not readily subject to challenge under the Establishment 
Clause.&quot;[35] The program in question was a Minnesota tax deduction 
for tuition, transportation and textbooks, which had been broadly defined 
to include extra educational benefits for even public school students.

<p>

However, by defining &quot;allowable uses&quot; or &quot;eligible
institutions,&quot; tax benefits linked to tuition may carry the
same threat of regulation as vouchers. Or they might exclude religious
institutions altogether. But a refundable tax credit for the &quot;non-use
of the public school&quot; would avoid such meddling, eliminating
the need to define allowable uses of the tax credit. Since 
&quot;non-users&quot; of the public schools already exist, there would be 
no further need to define or regulate recipients. Recently proposed in 
Idaho, the tax credit for the non-use of the public school received a
favorable review from the state attorney general, who cited it
as fundamentally different from both the tuition tax credits and
the vouchers which the state's strict definition of separation
of church and state would prohibit. &quot;[T]he proposed initiative's
grant of the tax credit to parents of all non-public school students
-- home-schooled, private non-sectarian, and private parochial
-- coupled with the absence of a direct financial benefit to parochial
schools, makes it probable this proposal will be upheld under
the U.S. Constitution.&quot;[36]

<p>

A two-tiered mediating proposal might offer a small, &quot;standard&quot;
educational tax credit of perhaps $500 to all parents of school-aged
children, and a larger tax credit of up to $3,000 for &quot;itemized&quot;
educational expenditures, broadly defined to include everything
from enrichment experiences for the public school student to private
school tuition to home school expenses. (As a general rule, tax
credits should be no higher than the average cost of local private
school tuition -- which is generally $2,500 to $3,000.[37] If keyed
to the average public school per-pupil expenditure -- as some
voucher plans propose -- the efficiency of the marketplace is
undermined by artificial inflation.)

<p>

This would limit the threat of regulation while expanding the
coalition of beneficiaries.[38]

Any proposal, however, must be considered in light of state constitutions.
Given the variance among state constitutions, as exemplified by
Idaho and Minnesota, educational choice proposals are probably
best handled at the state level. State action will be increasingly
viable as grass-roots sentiment mounts to eliminate the federal
role in education.

<p>

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>

In <I>Perspectives on the Reagan Years</I>, political analyst
John Palmer argues that the Reagan Administration heightened public
awareness of an inevitable tension among political values that
decades of economic prosperity had obscured. Palmer refers to
the tensions among efficiency, social equity, and individual liberty
-- the reconciliation of which John Maynard Keynes identified
as &quot;the political problem of mankind.&quot; Just as education
was one component of the Great Society poverty programs, educational
choice was a key component of the Reagan Administration's efforts
to remake the welfare state in the image of its own philosophy.
The Reagan Administration argued that the American version of
the welfare state unduly sacrificed both individual liberty and
efficiency in the pursuit of social justice and that more diligent
concern for the former would inevitably promote the latter.

<p>

Reagan officials trumpeted educational choice as a means to mediate
between the competing values of liberty and equality -- a role
that could not have been claimed for choice without a substantial
redefinition of equality in the wake of Great Society failures.
In the words of former Secretary of Education Lauro Cavazos, appointed
by Reagan, &quot;[e]vidence shows that the growing demand for
parental choice in the United States derives not simply from a
desire for improved test scores, but from changing perspectives
on liberty and equity. It flows from an urgent reconsideration
of the role of the family and of other institutions and associations
that mediate between the individual and the State.&quot;[39]

<p>

Conservative advocates of choice must move quickly to popularize
a definition of social justice that reserves respect for individual
liberty and the primacy of the family. A more thorough attempt
at reconciling &quot;equality&quot; with &quot;liberty&quot; is
beyond the scope of the present paper. Suffice it to say that
the central issue is human dignity; that the phrase &quot;all
men are created equal&quot; promises no more -- and no less --
than equal moral worth, and that freedom is the air that true
equality must breathe to survive.

<BR><FONT SIZE=7>Clinton seeks to please<BR>gays and moderates</FONT>
<HR WIDTH=50%>By Paul Bedard<BR><font size=1>
The Washington Times</font><HR WIDTH=30%></center>


<BR><DD>President Clinton is wooing homosexual voters and AIDS activists, who were angered by his handling of their issues earlier in his term, by making new promises to consider expanded civil rights - including same-sex &quot;marriages.&quot;

<BR><DD>Capitalizing on a top issue in the community, Marsha Scott, Mr. Clinton's liaison to homosexual activists, is seeking suggestions on what position the president should take on same-sex marriages.

<BR><DD>In Boston recently, Miss Scott told a homosexual group, &quot;We [need] to find ways to ensure that those of you in these loving, long-term and committed relationships can enjoy all the same benefits that [heterosexual couples] are entitled to under the law.&quot;

<BR><DD>She added that using same-sex marriages may not be the right &quot;vehicle&quot; now but said, &quot;I'm going to argue that we broaden the context and look at the rights that gays and lesbians have ... and where those rights are denied.&quot;

<BR><DD>Asked about Miss Scott's little-noticed statements, a senior administration official said homosexual marriage is &quot;not something we intend to espouse.&quot;

<BR><DD>The official said that the White House will leave it to states to decide the issue, and that Mr. Clinton wants to do &quot;everything we can to support&quot; traditional marriages between heterosexuals.

<BR><DD>But the aide added: &quot;The president is aware that many communities and institutions are considering whether certain basic benefits can be provided outside the context of traditional marriage. The challenge in addressing these issues is to remain sensitive to the traditional values of our communities while preserving the fundamental right to live free from unjustified discrimination.&quot;

<BR><DD>Mr. Clinton, said the official, is &quot;personally&quot; opposed to homosexual marriages.

<BR><DD>Opponents of Mr. Clinton, however, noted that he also &quot;objected&quot; to late-term partial-birth abortions but vetoed a ban on the procedure.

<BR><DD>Conservative and liberal critics of the president complained about the aide's comments, which they said were designed merely to solicit support for the president. Miss Scott did not return a reporter's phone call.

<BR><DD>Steve Michael, a third-party presidential candidate supported by ACT UP, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, said &quot;they're making more empty promises.&quot;

<BR><DD>Robert Knight of the conservative Family Research Council said, &quot;The president is between a rock and a hard place, because he knows embracing same-sex marriage would alienate most voters who view him as a moderate.&quot;

<BR><DD>In an interview with Windows, New England's largest homosexual newspaper, Miss Scott said that in a Dole-Clinton race, &quot;I think you have extremely clear choices. You are either at the political table with a Clinton administration, or there is not even a door for you to get to the table.&quot;

<title>The Senate Faces Term Limits - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>THE SENATE FACES TERM LIMITS</h3>

By Kenneth R. Weinstein<br>
Director, Government Reform Project<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
<p>
Backgrounder Update No. 274<br>
April 19, 1996<br>
<p>
(Updating David M. Mason, "House Term Limit Options: Good, Better, Best," Heritage Foundation <I>Executive Memorandum</I> No. 406, March 22, 1995.)
<p><hr width=50%></center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Next week, the U.S. Senate will make history as it begins consideration of  <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:s.j.res.00021:">S.J. Res. 21</a>, a constitutional amendment to limit the number of terms members of the House and Senate may serve. The amendment provides a uniform term limit of 12 years for House members and Senators.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Term limits are needed because long-term congressional incumbency tends to distort the character of representation. By becoming overly oriented toward the federal government and insulated from the public, Members of Congress can develop a set of interests and sympathies at odds with those held by their constituents. Term limits therefore would work to keep elected officials more in touch with voters. In addition, frequent rotation in office would help assure a continuous flow of new energy and innovative thinking in Congress.
<p>
<b>THE PUBLIC JUDGMENT </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Among major public policy issues, term limits enjoys virtually unrivaled public support. As far back as 1964, a Gallup poll recorded a 49 percent plurality of Americans favoring term limits; since then, support has swelled to 64 percent in 1990 and 73 percent in 1995. Moreover, even though a reform-minded Congress was elected in 1994, support for term limits continued to grow to 77 percent in 1996.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, unlike other "hot-button" issues whose support withers in the heat of public debate, support for term limits remains firm. Between 1990 and 1995, initiatives were approved in 23 states, with support averaging 66 percent.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yet, despite this overwhelming public support, in May 1995, the Supreme Court declared in <I>U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton</I> that state-imposed term limits on federal lawmakers are unconstitutional. Thus, if federal term limits are to be enacted, the only remaining course appears to be adoption of a constitutional amendment such as S.J. Res. 21.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The electoral tsunami of 1994 was due in no small part to public support for term limits, so the new majority in Congress has a special obligation to deliver on this issue. Indeed, ten of the 12 freshman senators already have announced their support for term limits. As public support continues to grow, long-term incumbents opposed to term limitsespecially those from states that already place term limits on their state and local officialsmust explain why they continue to ignore the public will.
<p>
<b>TEN LEADING MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT TERM LIMITS</b>
<p><ol>
<b><li>Claim: Term limits are an untested innovation. 
<p>
Fact: Along with the President, 37 governors are subject to term limits.</b> Term limits were contained in America's first governing document, the Articles of Confederation of 1781, but were not written into the Constitution, primarily because its authors saw them as "entering into too much detail" for a short document.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
<b><li>Claim: The election of scores of new Senators and Representatives in 1994 disproves the need for term limits.
<p>
Fact: 314 of the 348 incumbent House members who sought re-election won -- a re-election rate of 90 percent.</b> Fully 92 percent of incumbent Senators -- 24 of 26 candidates -- won re-election.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
<b><li>Claim: Campaign finance reform will render term limits obsolete. 
<p>
Fact: Senator Fred Thompson (R-TN) has called term limits "the ultimate campaign finance reform vehicle."</b>  Term limits create open seats, which lead to contested races. These races are more competitive because they are less costly: Challengers do not have to compensate for the fundraising advantage held by incumbents, who nearly always win.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: Term limits will deprive the nation of talented legislators. 
<p>
Fact: Self-governance is the basic supposition of democracy. </b>It is sheer arrogance to maintain that only one person in a half-million is qualified to be in Congress. Furthermore, while term-limited Senators and Representatives could serve in different capacities, other talented individuals would be given opportunity for advancement.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: Term limits are undemocratic because they restrict voter choice. 
<p>
Fact: Incumbents enjoy electoral advantages franking, staff, and travel allowances that present huge barriers to entry by challengers.</b> Moreover, experience at the state level suggests that term limits actually increase voter choice. In California, for instance, the imposition of state-level term limits in 1990 led to an increase of over 25 percent in campaign filings for the Senate and a similar increase of over 50 percent in filings for the Assembly by 1992.<sup>5</sup>  During the past half-century, gubernatorial races have been more competitive in term-limited states -- even in years when governors can run for re-election.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: The limited-government agenda of the 104th Congress means that term limits are no longer needed to fight pork-barrel politics. 
<p>
Fact: The longer individuals serve in Congress, the greater their propensity to support new spending initiatives.</b><sup>7</sup>  The frequent rotation imposed by term limits, on the other hand, would help to institutionalize the 104th Congress's bias against big spending.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: Conservatives should avoid amending the Constitution at all costs. 
<p>
Fact: As George Will, a former opponent of term limits, argues, term limits offer a necessary constitutional corrective to the profound extraconstitutional metamorphosis of the federal government.</b> The Founders envisioned a citizen legislature as the backbone of limited government; as the interventionist state arose, however, politicians began to view public office as a career.<sup>8</sup>  Term limits would work to restore the Founders' intent by diminishing the tendency of Members of Congress to exploit their legally acquired powers to remain in office.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: As Senators find their terms limited, the Senate's capacity for deliberation and independent judgment likewise will be restricted. 
<p>
Fact: Term limits enhance the capacity for independence</b> by discouraging excessive concentration on fund-raising, re-election, and catering to special interests.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: If term limits are such a good idea, they should be imposed retroactively. 
<p>
Fact: Rather than openly oppose term limits, opponents have pursued a shrewd strategy of calling for retroactive application.</b> This argument is a red herring. Term limits represent principle, not retribution, and the public has rejected retribution. Only one retroactive congressional term limits measure has been offered to the voters (in Washington State in 1991), and it was rejected. It is not surprising that opponents of term limits are the only ones pushing for retroactive application.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: Under term limits, unelected individuals will run Congress. 
<p>
Fact: This argument assumes that the departure of senior incumbents will create a vacuum in which more and more decisions are made by lobbyists and staff.</b> Lobbyists thrive because they cultivate relationships with long-term incumbents; rapid turnover would greatly diminish the value of such contacts. As for staff, anyone who has seen a congressional office knows that Congressmen give assignments rather than take them. The specter of career staff manipulating freshman Members has little support in reality. In a non-term-limited Congress, staff employees work on average between five and six years.<sup>9</sup>  Under term limits, new Members would likely replace aides to former Congressmen with employees of their own choosing.
</ol><p>
<b>THE SENATE VOTE AND THE THREAT OF A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

One of the few reforms devised and implemented by people who live beyond the Beltway, term limits are a tribute to public involvement in politics. Yet, despite powerful grassroots support, term-limit laws in 23 states were overturned in May 1995 by the U.S. Supreme Court -- after the U.S. House of Representatives had failed to muster the two-thirds majority needed to ratify a federal constitutional amendment.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Frustrated by the Court's ruling and skeptical of Congress's desire to pass a constitutional amendment, some activists are pursuing a radical approach: calling for two-thirds of America's 50 state legislatures to approve an unprecedented constitutional convention to impose term limits. State legislatures in North Dakota and Utah already have called for such a convention. This year, 11 states will offer ballot measures to instruct state legislators to vote for a constitutional convention on term limits. Activists hope to garner the support of 34 state legislatures by the year 1999.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Term limits will remain a potent issue in 1996. President Clinton has decided to ignore the continued groundswell by opposing term limits. By contrast, Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) deserves credit for assuring that they will be considered by the U.S. Senate. Whether members of the Senate will continue to ignore public opinion -- thereby fueling the drive for a term limits constitutional convention -- remains to be seen.

<title>Spirit of '96 - Policy Review - May-June 96 - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h2>Spirit of '96</h2>
<b>By Grover Norquist</b>
<P>
<b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</b><br> May-June 1996, Number 77</i><hr width=50%></center>
<p>
Sidebar: <a href="#rector">In Welfare Reform, Governors Miss the Point</a> by Robert Rector.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Since the Republican victories of November 8, 1994, the press has focused on the dramatic changes in Congress. With a net gain of 52 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and eight seats in the U.S. Senate, the Republicans took control of both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years. Party-switching and special elections have since left the partisan balance in the House of Representatives at 236 Republicans to 198 Democrats (with one independent); in the Senate, it is 53 Republicans to 47 Democrats.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This shift in party control certainly changed the direction of the national policy debate in Washington. Less than two years ago, Congress was seriously debating President Clinton's attempt to nationalize the entire health-care industry. And just a year earlier, Congress passed and Clinton signed a budget that contained what Democratic senator Pat Moynihan called the largest tax increase in the history of the world. Since the elections of 1994, however, the debate in Washington has centered on how to cut taxes and balance the budget in a way that would, over time, cut the size of the federal government from 21.2 percent of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product to roughly 17 percent. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	
Yet the intense focus on Washington, D.C., has obscured the conservative revolution within the states. In some ways, the changes occurring in state capitals across the country are even more important than those inside the Beltway. Conservative reforms at the state level make similar efforts in Washington both more likely and, oddly, less important. The states have led the way so far, and they are quite prepared to march ahead, even if the revolution in Washington stalls.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Although less visible, the 1994 shift in partisan control was more pronounced at the state and local levels than in Washington. Republicans won 24 of 36 gubernatorial races to increase the number of statehouses in their column from 19 to 30. With Mike Foster's victory in last year's gubernatorial election in Louisiana, Republicans now occupy 31 statehouses. More than 72 percent of the American people now live in states with Republican governors. Within state legislatures, the GOP gained 105 senate seats and 367 house seats in 1994 to gain control of seven upper chambers and 10 lower chambers. Since that election, 50 state legislators have switched to the GOP. 
<p>
<img src="norq.gif" align=center>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These gains have historic consequences. Prior to the 1994 elections, Democrats controlled the governorship and both legislative chambers in 17 states. In these states, all labor law, election law, budgeting and taxes, redistricting, and judicial appointments were fully controlled by the Democratic Party. Republicans exercised similar control in just four states: Utah, Arizona, New Hampshire, and New Jersey. Today, the Democratic Party controls the governorship and the legislature only in Hawaii, Georgia, Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Maryland, while Republicans reign supreme in 15 states, including Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The nationwide shift to Republican governors affects the content of the policy debate in at least two ways. First, it intensifies the pressure from the states for more autonomy. In fact, strong lobbying by governors such as Bill Weld of Massachusetts, George Voinovich of Ohio, Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, and John Engler of Michigan was crucial to Republicans' efforts in the fall of 1995 to pass their historic budget, designed to give states unprecedented power over welfare and Medicaid programs.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Second, a Republican Congress is more likely to fulfill its commitment to "devolution" knowing that ideologically sympathetic governors are at the helm in many key states. Despite the Republican Party's dedication to federalism, is it plausible that Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole would have fought so hard to send billions of dollars with few conditions over the next seven years to Ann Richards or Mario Cuomo to run Medicaid, welfare, and other programs? Liberal governors would have gladly spent the money, then denounced Republican policies for ending entitlements. And a conservative party would have been irresponsible to hand billions in unrestricted federal dollars to its political enemies, who could use the money to hire Democratic precinct workers and build political machines to destroy Republican congressmen and senators. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The historic shift was not just a matter of <I>more</i> Republican governors. The high quality of these governors was also critical. A conservative Congress would have been rightly wary of handing power and money over to yesteryear's generation of Republicans -- including Nelson Rockefeller of New York, Bob Ray of Iowa, Bill Milliken of Michigan, and James Rhodes of Ohio-whose records on spending, taxes, and the role of government were indistinguishable from that of Cuomo or Richards. Newt Gingrich is to Bob Michel as Michigan's John Engler is to Milliken, as New York's George Pataki is to Rockefeller. This profound ideological shift among governors and state legislators has occurred in more than 25 states.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The emergence of conservative Republican leadership simultaneously at the national and state levels was no coincidence. In the 1980s, Newt Gingrich learned from John Engler, then majority leader of the Michigan state senate, that many state legislators drove to attend legislative sessions. By sending them Republican audio tapes to listen to on these drives, Gingrich began to coordinate a conservative political message across the nation. The reforms that Engler and Tommy Thompson later pushed through their respective legislatures revealed what Republican governance could achieve. Their ideas for welfare reform, which predated the 1994 election, served as a national model for Republicans. The press attacked Engler savagely for ending general welfare for some 80,000 able-bodied men. But his recovery and the victories of Republican state senators running only six months later proved again that voters value effective policy over partisan polemics.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Washington, political reform has been frustrated by a recalcitrant Senate and Bill Clinton's veto pen. Of the Contract With America's 10 specific items, Congress has passed only the line-item veto, procedural reforms in the House of Representatives, and the Congressional Accountability Act, which brings Congress somewhat under the same laws it imposes upon business. The House has passed the Balanced Budget Amendment, regulatory reform, and other legislation, only to see them watered down or stopped in the Senate. Bill Clinton has twice vetoed welfare reform, and a relatively narrow tort-reform bill was passed over his veto.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the meantime, the states have not stood still. The new generation of Republican governors and state legislators is advancing the Republican reform agenda -- from tax cuts to tort reform. Here are a few of the critical issues raised by the Contract With America and addressed by the states. They provide a blueprint for future work in Washington:<p><b>Taxes</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1993, Clinton campaign strategist James Carville announced that the off-year governor's race in New Jersey between incumbent Democrat Jim Florio -- who had raised taxes in 1989 -- and his challenger Christine Todd Whitman -- who called for a 30 percent across-the-board income-tax cut -- would be the burial ground of Republican advocacy of tax reduction.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Carville misidentified the cadaver. Whitman made the last month of the campaign a clear referendum on her tax-cut proposals, and it worked. Whitman's victory was critical in ensuring that tax cuts would be prominent in the Contract With America a year later.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1995, while Republicans in Congress were debating a $500-per-child tax credit and cutting the capital-gains tax in half, 17 states with Republican governors cut taxes. In addition, Bill Weld in Massachusetts and Kirk Fordice in Mississippi pushed for tax cuts but faced overwhelming opposition by Democratic legislatures. Arizona governor Fife Symington won an income-tax reduction of $130 million in 1994 and $200 million in 1995, and plans to phase out the income tax over the next four years.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And in New Hampshire, Governor Steve Merrill demonstrated that taking the no-income-tax pledge remains a powerful campaign weapon and effective tool for governing. The Taxpayer-Protection Pledge -- made famous when George Bush won the Republican nomination and presidency because he took the pledge and then lost re-election when he broke it -- was born in New Hampshire in 1972. Since then, no one who has not taken the pledge has ever won the governorship of the state.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the 1994 elections, Merrill had the happy idea of extending the pledge against a sales or income tax increase to the campaigns for the state senate. Before the election, there were 13 Republicans in the state senate and 11 Democrats. Merrill led a slate of 23 Republicans who took the pledge as a team (foreshadowing the Contract With America); as a result, the Republicans seized 18 of 25 state senate seats and drove from office two Republicans known in New Hampshire as RINOs, or Republicans in Name Only, who had voted with the other party. In 1996, all 395 members of New Hampshire's house of representatives will be asked to take the pledge, separating the RINOs from the Merrill low-tax Republicans. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Taxpayer activists in 40 states are now pushing state legislators, governors, and candidates for those offices to take a state taxpayer-protection pledge. Mike Foster won the governorship of Louisiana as a pledge-taker, and Alabama's Fob James signed the pledge in early 1996 to highlight his consistent opposition to tax increases.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This state emphasis on holding down taxes has already produced results. In Kansas, Governor Bill Graves passed legislation cutting the automobile tax in half over five years and repealing a 2.5 percent sales tax on labor used in new construction and on utilities used in manufacturing. Graves also enacted a two-year moratorium on the collection of unemployment taxes from many Kansas businesses, saving them nearly $275 million. Iowa governor Terry Branstad is pushing legislation to phase out over six years the property tax on machinery and equipment, which is now taxed at 30 percent of its original cost. In New Hampshire, Merrill reduced the tax rate on business profits to its lowest level in 14 years, cut the telecommunications tax and the real estate tax, and abolished the savings-bank tax and the corporate-franchise tax.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Massachusetts, Bill Weld has achieved nine tax cuts, including the abolition of the inheritance tax, a rollback of Michael Dukakis's increases in income taxes and sales taxes and-despite an overwhelmingly Democratic legislature -- a cut in the capital-gains tax.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Weld's position on taxes illuminates the national debate over the flat tax. Massachusetts's constitution requires a single income-tax rate, now set at 5.95 percent. In 1994, the public-employee unions financed an initiative campaign to repeal this tax provision and establish a graduated, or "progressive," income tax. Weld and Citizens for Limited Taxation defeated the campaign, pointing out that a multiple-rate system allows politicians to separate voters into income groups and play them against each other.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On April 15, 1996, and again on April 15, 1997, the U.S. House of Representatives will vote on a constitutional amendment to require a two-thirds supermajority vote for any federal tax increase. This idea, too, is drawn from the states. The two-thirds supermajority was part of California's Proposition 13 in 1978, and in 1994, Fife Symington and Arizona taxpayer groups backed a successful ballot initiative that amended the state constitution to require a two-thirds vote of the legislature for tax hikes.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The federal and state constitutions require supermajorities for any legislative actions that depend on widespread support for their legitimacy (like overriding vetoes). Tax increases also demand that level of scrutiny. Taxpayer activists in Arizona are now circulating another initiative to require a two-thirds supermajority for any tax hike approved by the voters directly. They fear that public-employee unions will swamp low-turnout elections and force local or state tax hikes. George Voinovich in Ohio is working with taxpayer advocates on a ballot proposal to require a two-thirds supermajority vote for major tax hikes. Just as term limits swept through 23 states and became part of the Contract With America, the drive for supermajority requirements for tax increases has also been moving on parallel paths at the national and state level.<p><b>School Choice</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Washington, Republicans tried to provide parental choice in education for several thousand of the poorest families in Washington, D.C. Led by Republican congressman Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin, the House of Representatives approved the measure in the 1996 appropriations bill for the District. But as of March, the measure was stymied in the Senate by a Democratic filibuster.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As with many issues, parental choice in education reached the national political agenda via the states. Tommy Thompson led the way in 1990 with a model school-choice program for poor Milwaukee parents. More than 1,000 children have qualified to receive vouchers for tuition at secular private schools. The teachers unions maintained that only public schools could provide good education, but studies have shown that Milwaukee public schools suffer a 79 percent attendance rate and a 48 percent graduation rate. By comparison, the city's private schools boast rates of 96 percent and 88 percent respectively.Growing public support for school choice led Thompson to sign legislation last July that expanded the number of eligible children to 7,000 in the current school year and to 15,000 next year. This expanded program -- now being challenged in court -- would give parents the freedom to send their children to parochial or other religious schools. Pending a court decision, the Bradley Foundation and other private funders are financing vouchers for low-income students accepted to private schools.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In Pennsylvania, Governor Tom Ridge put school choice at the top of his agenda. Although Republicans controlled both houses of the legislature, the governor's KID I program failed last year by six votes. Ridge returned last fall with a more modest program to provide $132 million for scholarships for as many as 50,000 students. To reassure skeptics, this version was designed to expire if not reauthorized and was limited to certain cities and counties. Ridge also added a provision ensuring that no school district in Pennsylvania would lose money as a result of school choice. As of this writing, the legislature has once more refused to follow the governor's lead, but key legislators vow that the battle is far from over.In Minnesota, Governor Arne Carlson wants to provide 65,000 low-income students in Minneapolis-St. Paul and a rural district yet to be named with vouchers of up to $3,000, valid at any school. Governor Carlson does not yet have a Republican majority in both houses, but is moving school choice forward by organizing a Republican Task Force for School Choice to put political muscle behind his vision.By promoting school choice, Carlson unites economic conservatives in the business community --who know that school choice will reduce education costs and raise the quality of high-school graduates -- with social conservatives who want parents, rather than bureaucrats, to control their children's education.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Arizona last year, Governor Fife Symington backed a statewide school-choice plan to give all Arizona students up to $1,500 to attend any private school of their choice. Many national figures in the GOP lobbied legislators on behalf of Symington's platform, yet the measure fell three votes short in the state senate, thanks to a handful of Republicans with ties to the National Education Association.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In California, teachers unions  spent $15 million of their members' dues in the fall of 1993 to defeat a school-choice ballot initiative. In his 1996 State of the State address, however, Governor Pete Wilson endorsed a targeted pilot program for school choice. Wilson's proposal would provide 250,000 children in the poorest 5 percent of California's public schools with up to $4,500 each to attend the public, private, or religious school of their choice. Connecticut's Governor John Rowland is also supporting a pilot school-choice program.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Massachusetts, Michigan, and Arizona have all embarked on extensive charter-school programs, allowing individuals and teachers to create their own public schools, free of many existing regulations. While charter schools are not school choice, they do offer a real opportunity for many teachers and students to scale the wall the NEA has erected to keep "its" children from escaping bad schools.<p><b>Tort Reform</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1995, 12 Republican governors took on one of the fiercest Democratic special-interest groups -- the trial lawyers -- and won. While Congress was only able to enact a very limited reform of frivolous stockholder lawsuits, Republican governors made significant strides. Walter Olson, the author of <I>The Litigation Explosion</I>, cites tort-reform initiatives by George Bush Jr. in Texas and Jim Edgar in Illinois as two of the most far-reaching.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Texas now limits punitive damages, requires "clear and convincing" evidence to prove malice, raises the qualifications for expert witnesses, and eliminates joint liability for defendants less than 51 percent at fault.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The new Illinois law bars any plaintiff found to be more than 50 percent at fault from recovering damages (which should stop drunks from suing after falling in front of trains), prohibits punitive-damage awards except where defendants behave "with an evil motive or with a reckless indifference to the rights of others," abolishes joint liability for economic and noneconomic damages (thus protecting "deep pocket" defendants from the liability of others), and provides the stiffest reform of product liability in the nation. The Illinois law also protects landowners from being sued by trespassers in most cases.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	North Dakota governor Edward T. Schafer passed a product-liability reform package aimed at luring airplane manufacturers to North Dakota. Schafer has pointed out that states need not compete for business by offering subsidies or special tax breaks; instead, they can all lower regulatory and liability costs, and everyone wins.<p><b>Crime</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The latest Republican anti-crime agenda has made little headway in Washington, where the Senate has failed to act on a package of bills passed by the House. Meanwhile, Republican governors led the way in enacting "truth-in-sentencing" laws that require violent criminals to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences, with time off for good behavior but not parole. Governor Fob James of Alabama reintroduced chain gangs -- although the new chains are made of sturdy plastic. He also instituted work and education requirements for inmates to earn television and recreation privileges and banned inmate access to pornography. Mississippi's Kirk Fordice has reestablished the state prison farm, and taken a thousand television sets away from prisoners. Under Pete Wilson, California has carried out its first two executions in 25 years. In New York, after 19 vetoes by Mario Cuomo, Governor George Pataki signed legislation restoring the death penalty and honored Oklahoma's extradition request for murderer Thomas Grasso, who was subsequently executed for murder. Connecticut's John Rowland restored the death penalty there.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Bucking the pro-gun control trend in Washington, D.C., that as recently as the fall of 1993 saw the "Brady Bill" passed and the so-called assault-weapon ban included in Bill Clinton's "crime" bill, 28 states have passed "concealed-carry" laws that require local officials to grant licenses to qualified adults who wish to carry concealed handguns. Ten states passed concealed-carry laws in 1995, including Oklahoma, which did not blink at liberal efforts to blame gun owners, taxpayers, and/or radio talk show hosts for the terrorist bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City. Mike Foster, Louisiana's new Republican governor, campaigned on a commitment to sign a concealed-carry law that his Democratic predecessor had vetoed. Ohio, too, with its new Republican majorities, has the votes to pass a concealed-carry law.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Crime is always a thorny issue for Republicans in Washington, caught between their federalist belief in local responsibility for law enforcement and public pressure for federal action on crime. The success of Republicans at the state level at implementing tough anti-crime measures has the added benefit of taking national Republicans off the hook.<p><b>Welfare</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Although Bill Clinton has vetoed the Republican welfare-reform bill (which embodies concepts that he once embraced), Republican governors continue to experiment with efforts to free individuals from the dependency of welfare. Tommy Thompson began a series of reforms in 1987 that have reduced Wisconsin's welfare caseload by 32 percent while welfare rolls nationwide were increasing by 25 percent. Pete Wilson suspended cost-of-living adjustments for welfare payments, saving taxpayers $6.3 billion over the past four years and keeping welfare costs 27 percent below where they would otherwise have been.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fife Symington has cut Arizona welfare rolls by 10 percent. His new "Empower" welfare reform limits able-bodied recipients to no more than 24 months of welfare benefits in a five-year period, ends additional payments for welfare recipients who have additional children, and requires minors to live at home to receive any benefits. Between 1992 and 1995, George Voinovich phased out Ohio's generous general-assistance program, which was paying benefits to 142,000 able-bodied Buckeyes. Bill Weld has pushed a series of reforms that have reduced the Massachusetts welfare caseload for 25 straight months. Almost every Republican governor has passed, introduced, or requested a federal waiver for welfare reform in their state. New Hampshire alone has requested 65 waivers from federal welfare requirements. Faced with a stone wall in Washington, Steve Merrill is now prepared to institute his reforms anyway.Spending Restraint
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The conflict between Congress and the president over the size and cost of government has already shut down the federal government repeatedly. This fight has played itself out in the states as well. Steve Merrill had to fight his own Republican legislature to lower spending, and finally won a budget lower than that passed by either chamber of the legislature. Merrill's veto of legislation that would have doubled state aid to education was upheld. Merrill, George Pataki of New York, and Bill Weld of Massachusetts are the only three governors who have actually shrunk their budgets since the previous year.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Ohio, George Voinovich won legislation eliminating two state cabinet agencies. He plans to privatize 78 state liquor stores, saving Ohio taxpayers $20 million annually. Cabinet agencies under the governor's control had 3,162 fewer employees in 1995 than in 1991, a reduction of 8.3 percent. Pete Wilson is asking for an amendment to the California constitution requiring a two-thirds supermajority vote for any new and costly regulation. Kansas governor Bill Graves enacted a six-month moratorium on new government regulations, and then eliminated 530 obsolete rules.<p><b>Medical Savings Accounts</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This centerpiece of the Republican reform of Medicare was blocked by Clinton's veto pen, but in 1995, five Republican governors (Fife Symington, Kirk Fordice, Jim Edgar, John Engler, and Idaho's Philip Batt) shepherded medical savings accounts through their state legislatures. These forays into market-based health care will have a significant effect on overall medical costs and insurance premiums, contributing substantially to the debate in Washington, and perhaps eventually ending the impasse. And, when Congress does finally enact reforms in Medicare, the states will already have in place the mechanisms to take full advantage of it.<p><b>Property Rights</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In March 1995, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation recognizing that the Takings Clause of the Constitution is invoked when government actions destroy or reduce the value of private property, not just when the property is physically occupied by government. That legislation has not seen final action, of course. The pressures that produced it are growing throughout the country, however, and governors and state legislatures are responding to them.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Beginning in 1992, the states began passing legislation protecting the property rights of their citizens. To date, 23 states have enacted legislation of varying strength, and more efforts are under way. Most of these involve some form of compensation for land values affected by state restrictions on its use. In 1995, every state but Kentucky and Georgia was considering some form of property-rights legislation.<p><b>Color-Blind Society</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	California and Pete Wilson give a textbook example of how a state can force action that has been avoided for decades at the national level. Citizens have filed an initiative petition in California, the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI), that would prohibit the state from discriminating based on race or sex. It is a ban on racial preferences or quotas. For two decades, Washington politicians were able to say "I oppose quotas, but favor affirmative action," while supporting laws and court decisions that require racial preferences and quotas. The California initiative may force all national politicians, during an election year, to answer the following questions: "Are you for or against the CCRI as written?" They could no longer fudge or evade discussions of affirmative action.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Meanwhile, a dozen other states are considering measures similar to the California initiative. And on January 15, 1996 -- Martin Luther King Day --the newly elected Louisiana governor, Mike Foster, issued an executive order abolishing all racial preferences as abhorrent to King's vision of a color-blind society.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As a result, Republican leaders in the Congress have all stated their opposition to quotas and racial preferences. Bob Dole and Representative Charles Canady have introduced federal legislation mirroring California's. Black congressman Gary Franks, a Connecticut Republican was ready to push an amendment to an appropriations bill immediately eliminating contract set-asides for minorities. House leaders persuaded him to postpone it, but this is clearly an issue that will continue to surface at the federal level. There could hardly be a clearer example of state politics forcing an unwanted issue onto the Washington agenda.<p><b>Federalism</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Alabama governor Fob James took his oath of office standing under a banner carrying the words of the Tenth Amendment: "The Powers not delegated to the United States nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." Texas Governor George W. Bush has made a mantra of his call to "let Texans run Texas." Arizona's Fife Symington forced the federal government to reopen the Grand Canyon by threatening to operate it with state workers. He has since called on the federal government to cede control of the Grand Canyon to his state, and is working with Newt Gingrich to speed a transfer of power. Symington has also socked away $1 million to finance lawsuits that may be necessary to defend the state's Tenth Amendment rights.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Utah Governor Mike Leavitt has begun to organize a national movement to promote an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would give states the right to block national laws passed by Congress that violate their autonomy. For instance, two-thirds of the governors or perhaps two-thirds of state legislatures would have the power to overturn a federal law by passing resolutions of disapproval. As with a presidential veto, a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress would reinstate the law.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It may not be necessary to wait for an amendment. Leavitt is trying to get a commitment from Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole that they will force a second vote on any law or part of a law that draws written opposition from two-thirds of the governors. That would give America an opportunity to get used to the way the amendment would operate.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Some commentators ask which of the Republican governors is the best or most effective. In fact, the breadth of quality and activism is amazing. Certainly, John Engler of Michigan and Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin were early revolutionaries. Bill Weld of Massachusetts and Kirk Fordice of Mississippi demonstrated how much one can accomplish in the face of overwhelming Democratic legislatures. Arne Carlson of Minnesota and Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania have bravely challenged the teachers unions in their states, and George Bush of Texas and Jim Edgar of Illinois have taken on the trial-lawyer beast.	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;All the Republican governors are traveling in the same direction and showing real courage in tackling the special interests of the old establishment order. This is important in each state, but it is also critical nationally. Republican governors and state legislators are to the new Republican majority in Congress and any future Republican president what the labor unions and corrupt big-city machines are to the Democratic Party: its nationwide infrastructure. They are a second front arrayed against the liberal welfare state. In the last five years -- and most intensely in 1995 -- they have followed Lenin's advice to probe with bayonets, looking for weaknesses. Their triumphs guarantee the ultimate success of the Gingrich Revolution-no matter what happens in Washington.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<I><b>Grover Norquist</b> is the president of <a href="/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a> and the national political correspondent for the</I> American Spectator.

<h2>In Welfare Reform, Governors Miss the Point</h2>
<b>by Robert Rector</b>
</center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Congress is now considering a welfare-reform plan recently proposed by the nation's governors. Unfortunately, this plan ignores America's biggest social problem: the catastrophic rise of illegitimacy. 

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nearly a third of the children born in America last year were born out of wedlock. The illegitimacy rate is rising by a percentage point every year. And among blacks the out-of-wedlock birthrate has reached 69 percent. This figure astounds even New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who warned us in the early 1960s of the threat posed to the black community by the collapse of marriage. Moynihan's admonition was dismissed then, but the breakup of the black family and the calamities that have accompanied it are outstripping his most frightful predictions. 

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Ominously, the illegitimacy rate for whites is now edging toward 25 percent, almost exactly the rate for blacks when Moynihan first sounded his alarm. The white family now faces the same breakdown that has devastated black communities in the last 30 years. 

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Family collapse is the root cause of a host of social problems, including poverty, crime, drug abuse, and academic underachievement. Children born out of wedlock are seven times more likely to be poor than children born to couples who are married. Girls raised in single-parent homes on welfare are five times more likely to give birth out of wedlock than girls from intact, independent families. And a boy from a single-parent household in the inner city is twice as likely to become involved in crime as a similarly poor boy who lives with a father and a mother.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The nation's governors have responded to this grim reality by ignoring it. In unveiling their welfare reform plan, they have declared that there are three "key elements" to real welfare reform: (1) providing more government-funded day care; (2) increasing child support payments from absent fathers; (3) imposing time limits and work requirements on welfare recipients. Rising illegitimacy and the collapse of marriage do not receive even passing comment. 

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This plan represents a radical shift in the focus of the welfare debate -- from combating illegitimacy to providing public-support services to an ever-expanding population of single mothers. Dodging the illegitimacy issue entirely, the governors' plan promises a future in which marriage collapses further and the government must meet the needs of a burgeoning population of single-parent families. The triumph of the Left is complete: Fighting illegitimacy is "out," and funding government-run day care is "in."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Some argue that federal action on illegitimacy is not needed, that the governors will tackle the problem. But the governors' silence speaks volumes. Few have made reducing illegitimacy a priority; most are reluctant even to mention the topic. But by refusing to acknowledge the dangers of collapsing marriages and rising illegitimacy, they implicitly condone and ultimately promote illegitimacy. The result: Soon, half of all American children will be born out of wedlock and reared in government-run day-care centers. This is not reform -- this is a national disaster.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The governors' plan borrows heavily from the "reform" schemes of President Clinton and other liberal proposals. It also dovetails with the interests of America's huge welfare bureaucracy, which thrives on social decay. Although the plan will trim the growth rate of welfare spending slightly in the near term, it will lead to an explosion in welfare and social-service spending. In other words, we will have to pay the price for illegitimacy sooner or later.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Congress seems too willing to join the governors in ignoring illegitimacy. Under recent legislation, Congress will spend nearly a half trillion dollars over the next seven years to subsidize illegitimacy through welfare benefits, day care, job training, and other services. For every dollar spent to reduce illegitimacy, the federal government will spend about a thousand dollars on programs that contribute to it.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Marriage in America is dying, and the governors have prepared the coffin. Many in Congress seem willing to serve as pall bearers. But "welfare reform" is nonsense so long as the illegitimacy rate continues to rise. Vision and leadership are sorely needed -- and the governors especially seem unable to provide either.<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
discusses a critical issue which is sweeping our country, making 
headlines nationwide, and causing a stir in American families:  the 
possible redefining of marriage to include homosexual unions.

<p>

We will be talking to Robert Knight of the Family Research Council, 
who has thoroughly researched the homosexual activist movement and their 
attempts to dramatically change family life as we know it. And we will
also bring you Anthony Falzarano, who, as a former homosexual,
knows well the inside story on homosexual culture and the attempts
to increase its influence by changing our laws.  These attempts
to redefine marriage will affect all of us, from the filing of
our taxes to our schools, to our workplaces, and beyond.  You
need to understand this phenomenon.

<p>

But first, let's hear from the Family Research Council's president, 
Gary Bauer.  Yesterday, Gary and I talked about a pivotal decision which 
may be made this very evening by President Clinton, whether to veto the 
Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act or to align himself with the majority of
Americans and majority of House and Senate members, who have clearly
stated that they strongly support the lifesaving act.

<p>

You will hear a lot of stories on this veto, but first, <i>Straight 
Talk</i> will take you Behind the Headlines.

<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, thanks so much for being with us today.

<p>

Just last week, on Good Friday, the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act
was finally sent to the President.  It was passed overwhelmingly
in both the House and the Senate.  It is a piece of legislation
that deals with a procedure in which the child is delivered into
the birth canal; moments from birth, a scissors stabbed into the
base of his skull; living brain tissue suctioned out; and this
is an abortion procedure that would be banned except to save the
life of the mother.

<p>

The President has been very clear that he intends to veto this bill. 
What do you think this says about the state of the abortion debate 
today?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  We probably should have given a disclaimer to the viewer 
who might not have wanted to hear that description.  It's incredible 
to think that in America we are actually aborting babies in the 
seventh, eighth, and ninth month of pregnancy using that procedure.

<p>

The country is deeply divided over abortion.  We all know that, Kristi. 
But every poll that I have seen shows that the American people 
overwhelmingly find this procedure to be reprehensible, to be grotesque; 
in fact, most Americans react in disbelief when they hear that it is 
something that goes on in clinics today.

<p>

So, for me, to hear the President of the United States say basically 
that he is going to fall on his sword over this; that he is so committed 
to abortion on demand that even these third-trimester abortions will 
continue under his Presidency is something that, in my mind, makes him 
an extremist on this issue.  I just don't know any other way to describe 
it. And it just seems sort of unusual, because he has really tried
in the last year or so to picture himself as being middle-of-the-road,
and I think he has been quite convincing with some Americans.

<p>

But here is an issue that gets past the rhetoric, goes right to
the heart of the debate in America about our liberty and how it
should be used, and the President has made it clear he is going
to stand with the National Organization for Women and the radicals
on this issue, and I think it is going to hurt him politically.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  One of the interesting things about this particular
abortion debate was that people who had never cast a pro-life
vote in their entire history voted for this particular ban.  What
do you think this says about the President's statement and his
advisors' statements that this particular abortion bill will work
for him?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, I don't know.  You know, the White
House does polling every night.  It is the first White House in
American history to do that, so you would expect them to have
a finely tuned sense of American public opinion.  I can't imagine
how in the world this issue would work for him, and quite frankly,
on an issue involving life and death, I would hope politicians
of all stripes would stop looking at these issues about what helps
them and what hurts them and start making judgments that are filled
with some sense of compassion and some sense of the sanctity of
life.  It just seems amazing to me that anyone would try to make
a political calculation over something this important.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Now, this bill does deal with the life-of-the-mother 
exception. If this procedure would be needed to save the mother's 
life, it would be available, but not for some of the other reasons,
not for elective abortion, for example.

<p>

This is the first time since <i>Roe v. Wade</i> that any abortion 
restriction at all has been made possible.  Why do you think that 
there has been a kind of restriction available now?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, you know, when you really think about it, people say 
that we have been debating abortion too much. Actually, we really 
don't as a society get to debate it really at all in any meaningful 
sense of the word.  The courts have driven this issue for over 20 
years, and no matter where you stand on the issue, the courts have had 
the trump cards. They keep throwing down their aces and stopping the 
American people from doing much about abortion one way or the other. 

<p>

This was the first time in a long, long time that the Congress of the 
United States actually had a real bill dealing with a real abortion 
issue that they had to debate and then vote on the record about.  I
think that is the important thing here.  These politicians in
the Congress knew that the whole country would see their vote
and would be able to ponder the meaning of those votes, and I
think that is why the final vote was so overwhelming.

<p>

Every once in a while, I tune in to C-SPAN that often will allow 
callers to comment on what is going on on the floor of the Congress, 
and what struck me was the just almost endless numbers of calls coming
in from people who would say, &quot;I'm pro-choice, but I can't
possibly support something like this.&quot;

<p>

So I think that is why this vote was so significant, and I think it 
reflects where the American people are on the abortion issue.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, you pointed out to me a poll out just this week 
which indicates that the majority of Americans in fact are actually 
pro-life or leaning toward pro-life.  What do the numbers tell us 
about people's sentiments toward abortions?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Yes, this is an area where there is great misunderstanding. 
The media generally says almost without question that Americans are 
&quot;pro-choice,&quot; which generally is interpreted to mean they 
favor abortion on demand.

<p>

What the polling data has shown for over 25 years and continues to 
show in 1996 is that about one-third of the country believes that 
abortion should be unrestricted totally. The other two-thirds of 
the country either wants abortion severely restricted
or doesn't want any abortions at all.  So to the extent that there
is a consensus in America, it is much more toward the pro-life
side.

<p>

Now, people get confused about what words like &quot;pro-choice&quot;
mean. That's why I always look at polls that get very specific:
Would you be in favor of abortion in this case or that case?
And when you ask that kind of question, it is clear that Americans,
two to one, take a generally pro-life position.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: This particular debate has been surrounded by a lot of 
powerful symbolism, first-time symbolism.  For example, the leaders of
the Catholic Church in America met in the park outside the White
House in pouring rain to pray and to ask the President not to
veto this particular bill.

<p>

Politically speaking, how do you think American Catholics will 
respond to a veto of the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, I think that what happened outside the White 
House just a few days ago was an incredible moral statement by the 
church that on this issue they would stand up to the President, 
even though they have some issues that they are in agreement with 
him on.

<p>

I think the interesting thing will be what will the average American 
Catholic -- and, for that matter, the average American evangelical -- 
do when they go to the voting booth in November on this kind of issue. 
There are a lot of issues that voters weigh, but presumably, men and 
women of faith are going to weigh issues that go directly to their 
faith first and foremost when they vote.

<p>

And so I think the President does run the risk of losing a lot of 
evangelical and Catholic votes if he follows through with his threat 
to veto this bill.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Do you think, Gary, that President Clinton will veto 
this bill, or is it possible that he might change his mind?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I think that the signals over the last couple of weeks 
have been so clear and so pronounced that he almost would look foolish 
at this point. He really has backed himself into a corner.

<p>

The other thing is, there are some very important groups that the 
President has to have the support of, some of the radical feminist 
groups, groups like Planned Parenthood, the National Organization for
Women, and so forth.  These groups are important parts of the
liberal coalition in the United States, and I think the President
is afraid that if he vetoes the bill, he will get criticism from
groups he is going to be counting on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The pro-life story can be put up against the Unabomber 
story right now, ironically enough. We have seen some very unfortunate 
and horrible shootings at abortion clinics and, after 30 peaceful years, 
an attempt to smear a lot of pro-life Americans, saying that these shooters
are representative; and then a man who by news accounts is a radical
environmentalist bombs quite a few people and in fact was involved,
they say, with Earth First, even killing people on an Earth First
hit list.

<p>

It has been interesting the way in which these two stories
have been handled and how people on both sides have been characterized.
What is your take on the way these pro-life and environmentalist
issues have been played?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, there clearly is a double standard, but first of all, 
let's make clear that everybody understands that we condemn, obviously, 
the abortion clinic shootings. Those have been terrible, terrible events, 
and the people responsible for them ought to be punished and sentenced 
to the full extent of the law.

<p>

What has been unfortunate, however, is the effort
of the pro-abortion side to take these incidents and blame them
or try to hang them on everyone who is pro-life.  I travel all
around the country, and I see tens of thousands of people sacrificing
financially and otherwise to help women in crisis pregnancy.
You've got crisis pregnancy clinics all over the country.  These
abortion murderers don't represent the pro-life movement.

<p>

But as you point out, here we have the Unabomber, who appears to be
an environmentalist, a radical environmentalist, associated in
some way with the group Earth First -- more investigation will
have to be done about that -- and yet the media is generally silent
about that connection.  The same media that wants to try to hang
a deranged killer at an abortion clinic and use him to smear the
whole pro-life movement is relatively silent when it comes to
using the Unabomber to raise questions about whether radical 
environmentalism has gone too far.

<p>

So I guess I would just ask that the standards be the same here. If 
pro-life rhetoric can be held to be responsible for a deranged 
individual, then I don't see how radical pro-environmental
rhetoric can't be held to the same standard when it comes to somebody
like the man that has been alleged to do these bombings.  Clearly,
the liberal bias of the media comes through time and time again,
and it is certainly pronounced in this case.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One last question, Gary.  As you know, President Clinton 
has tended to veto pro-life measures or to deal with abortion-related 
bills in the dead of night or on the weekend or sometimes in the middle
of, even once, a bombing that the United States was involved with.

<p>

What is your analysis on when this particular Partial Birth Abortion
Ban Act will be handled?

<p>

MR. BAUER: I think the best prediction is that it will happen late 
on a Friday when most of the media is already focused on other things, 
or it will happen on a day when there is big news someplace else, 
either foreign policy news and so forth.

<p>

This White House has shown a very clear pattern
of doing things it doesn't want the public to focus on at times
when the media is not going to be watching very closely, and I
suspect the same thing will happen on this.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you so much, Gary, for being with us.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Thank you, Kristi.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, we will begin our
discussion regarding same-sex marriage and how it could dramatically
influence society both today and forever.  Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as
the state of being united to a person of the opposite sex as husband
or wife, one woman and one man.  As basic and familiar as the
definition may sound, the literal and fundamental meaning of marriage
may undergo a drastic change if homosexual activists have their
way.  Currently across the nation, the battle to redefine marriage
and family is being waged.  Studies, statistics, and basic common
sense tell us that marriage between a man and a woman stabilizes
sexuality and provides the best environment in which to procreate
and raise children.  This has been found true both in research
and in all of recorded history.  The family, based on a committed
man and woman, exists as the foundation of society before recorded
time.

<p>

Yet homosexual activists seek to legitimize their relationships
by forcing acceptance of same-sex couples under the law.  It has
become clear that the mere tolerance of homosexual relationships
is no longer enough.

<p>

Some may question whether the decision to allow same-sex marriage 
would really do that much damage.  But those people may want to ask 
themselves whether they are willing to have businesses required to 
have family health benefits for homosexual couples, to have their 
children taught in school that homosexual sex is the moral equivalent 
of marital love, and to endorse adoption of children by homosexual 
couples.

<p>

Marriage has been revered and protected throughout the world because 
that specific and special relationship benefitted not only the people in 
them but the societies as well.  Legally destroying the exclusive territory
of marriage to achieve a political end will not provide the real
benefits of marriage to homosexuals, but it may be the blow that
the shattered American family does not survive.

<p>

To help us understand just how much a decision to redefine marriage to 
include same-sex relationships could change all of society, I am joined 
by two special guests:  Robert Knight, Director of Cultural Studies for
the Family Research Council, who has been one of the most influential
pro-family leaders in bringing this issue to light in research
and analysis; and Anthony Falzarano, Executive Director of Transformations
Ex-Gay Ministry, who works daily with men and women trying to
free themselves from the gay lifestyle.  Both are the most eloquent
experts on these issues today.

<p>

Welcome to the show.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Great to be here.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Thanks for the introduction, too.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You're welcome.  Most of the time you're one amongst
many anti; it is only fair that you're acknowledged for the 
contributions that you both have made.

<p>

I wanted to start -- as I talk about this issue, as you all both 
do very eloquently, so many people do not understand why we should 
care.  You know, look, they're already out there. There are already 
homosexuals and lesbians in relationships.  So they have a marriage 
ceremony.  What does it hurt?  And I ask you, what does it hurt?

<p>

Bob, I will start with you, and then Anthony.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, a lot of people don't realize that what they're 
seeking is not so much acceptance for individual relationships as a 
larger goal, which is acceptance within the law, which forces it on 
everybody else.

<p>

See, when you have a couple homosexuals who say, &quot;Well, we want to
commit to ourselves,&quot; and then they go have a ceremony, they've
got that right in this country.  It's a free country.  But when
they bring the law into it, they bring us all into it.  They tell
us all that this marriage license is now the same as mom and dad
over here, and that cheapens mom and dad's marriage license, because
suddenly that marriage, the word &quot;marriage&quot; doesn't
mean what it used to mean.  It's not a very specific, defined
thing.

<p>

When you do that, when you bring a counterfeit version
in, that hurts the original.  It hurts support for the original
within the law.  People have worked very hard over the years to
support marriage within the law by setting aside specific benefits
for it, protections.  You know, spouses can't testify against
each other in trials, and all kinds of things.

<p>

Support for these kinds of special set-asides would erode if the 
institution itself suddenly ceases to be that special man-woman 
unique relationship that is the heart of civilization.

<p>

We can't do without it, and that's the bottom line.  The state knows 
that. Even if the state didn't believe that any religion was valid -- 
Christianity, Judaism, Islam, anything -- they would still support 
marriage because it has such a wide array of social benefits.  There 
is no society on Earth that has functioned without marriage, and there 
are many that have gone into the dust bin of history as soon as they 
cheapened marriage:  Rome, Greece, some of the middle Chinese dynasties.
When marriage became cheapened, the social fabric began to unravel.

<p>

And we're seeing that in this country.  We have already cheapened
marriage with easy divorce.  We have prenuptial agreements, we
have people living together.  It has already hurt marriage.  But
this would be the final blow, to say that it doesn't even have
to be a man and a woman.  It could be two guys.  And if you're
at that point, why not three guys or four guys?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There are so many interesting countervailing trends right 
now. You have a move to get rid of no-fault divorce because we say
divorce has unraveled our society.  You have men's movements saying
we need fathers involved with their children.  And then you have
this whole homosexual activist movement saying, Oh, all of that
is null and void; we really just need to expand and have it mean
even less than it does today.

<p>

Anthony, you understand this very well.  Why do you think it matters 
whether or not we legally change the definition of marriage?

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: This is extremely important. I would obviously agree 
with Bob.  Basically, the homosexual, let's say the political gay 
community, is out to destroy the traditional marriage, heterosexual 
marriage, that God has designed for us. God deemed that the male 
would leave his parents and cling onto the female and the two would 
become one.

<p>

Basically, our country was founded on those Judeo-Christian 
values, and God has blessed our country because we have stood for 
those values. But over the last 25 years we have seen an incredible 
deterioration of those values.

<p>

What the gays are up to is, they can't change the church in our 
country.  They can't change the mainline church. They can't change 
the Roman Catholic church.  They can't change the mainline Protestant 
church's view of homosexuality:  it is sinful behavior.

<p>

So, basically, what they started with in 1973 was going to the 
next most important authority, which was the
American Psychological Association, and they pushed homosexuality
out of the <i>APA Journal</i>, and when the APA decided that they would
take homosexuality out of the DSM-III, which is the official digest
of mental illnesses in this country, with that they now had permission
from an authority to go to our Federal Government and go to our
state government and say, &quot;See, these professionals do not
consider this to be a mental illness; therefore, you are discriminating
against us, and you are going to have to give us our rights.&quot;

<p>

And now they are trying to get gay marriage pushed onto our country,
because then they can now go after the church, and they can say,
&quot;Well, the American Psychiatric Association says we're normal,
the Federal Government, the state government says we're normal;
therefore, if you don't start hiring us in that local Catholic
church or that local Protestant church or in that Christian day
school, we're going to sue you, and if you don't conform, the
Federal Government is going to take your 501(c)(3) status away
and is going to take your full tax-exempt status away; therefore,
many of these churches will not be able to survive.&quot;

<p>

It's just like Georgetown University was forced to have a pro-gay group
on their campus, and it's against Catholic teaching.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Georgetown, a Catholic University that we have to mention.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  Yes, and they get federal funding from the government.
And if you take that $40 or $50 million away, whatever that figure
is, Georgetown University will be out of business tomorrow.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think it is interesting to note not only how accurate
that prediction is for future society but present society.  A
gentleman in Seattle, for example, that called Family Research
Council not too long ago.  He was a business owner, had hired
a gentleman who was a homosexual as an accountant.  They did not
have the business to keep him employed, and so they had to lay
him off, and a suit was filed that it was homosexual discrimination
because this gentleman played Christian music in the business
that he owned.  Because of that, he is fighting an expensive lawsuit
on antidiscrimination grounds saying that his faith is the problem,
and it's an extraordinary case.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes. Here are some other cases.  Shell Oil Company on the 
West Coast, there was a homosexual higher level executive who used the 
company fax machine and the xerox machine to make fliers advertising a 
gay orgy. You know, it was a very explicit flier.  Well, that's not 
conduct suitable for a high executive at Shell Oil Company, so they fired
him.

<p>

He came back and said, &quot;Well, you fired me because I'm
gay.&quot;  So under California's gay rights law, he sued; he
won millions from Shell Oil Company.

<p>

That's what we're talking about whenever you're talking about gay 
rights. You're talking about giving somebody a gun to put at the head 
of anybody who disagrees with them, whether it's the Boy Scouts, whether 
it's a local dry-cleaning establishment or a giant corporation like
Shell Oil.

<p>

That's another reason we're fighting this whole gay
marriage idea, because when you create something that's immoral,
which gay marriage certainly is, by any stretch, by any religious
value system and tradition, and then you put it into the law,
you make everybody who disagrees a moral outlaw.  You make people
who disagree find themselves the target of civil suits, harassment
at work.

<p>

I just got a call today from a guy who works for a federal
contractor, and he has been fired from his job by a homosexual
supervisor who had been hiring homosexuals, and they found out
he was Christian and harassed him and finally fired him.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Amazing. And it's only the beginning.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: It's just the beginning.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  This is only the beginning.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And we're going to have to hear more
about this after the break.  Please join us after the commercial
break as we continue to discuss the homosexual agenda regarding
marriage and family. Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Tonight we are discussing the drastic ramifications of 
changing marriage to including same-sex relationships, and I am joined
again by Robert Knight, Director of Cultural Studies for the Family
Research Council, and Anthony Falzarano, Executive Director of
Transformations Ex-Gay Christian Ministries.  Thank you so much
again for being with us.

<p>

There is a lot of activity going on in Hawaii right now, and, Bob, 
we are going to get to you on that in a second, where the law is 
being a frontal attack.

<p>

But, Anthony, one thing that has been interesting to me in a lot of 
the homosexual activist literature is there's this myth out there that 
most homosexual relationships are two men, two women that have been 
together for 30 years and that we're merely going to legalize with this 
change something that is already taking place.  And yet the gay literature
is very clear that not only do they want to call the relationships
marriage; they don't want their marriages to be the same as what
we would call good marriages.  Could you explain that?

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Yes.  Well, basically, it is all propaganda.  They cannot 
sell short-term marriages to the American public.  They cannot sell
a marriage where there are three guys living in sin together.
So, basically, they choose, a certain amount of gays -- and there
are a certain percentage that are together in monogamous relationships,
but I can assure you, they are an extreme minimum.  Most homosexuals
are still highly promiscuous, even in the age of AIDS.  And, basically,
they get these people, they look all scrubbed, all American, they
have a house with a white picket fence in Falls Church, Virginia,
and you just think, Wow, they're just wonderful people; how can
we discriminate against these people?  And, basically, they are
pushing this pro-gay agenda onto the American public.  If they
can get --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  But the gay literature -- one thing
that has been interesting to me is the gay literature has come
right out and said we can't keep monogamy in our definition of
marriage.  We may have a significant relationship we'll call marriage,
but things like monogamy and fidelity, faithfulness, and lifetime
kind of till-death-do-us-part commitments are a little unrealistic.
So we want it to be marriage, but we don't want it to be monogamous.

<p>

It has been a strange delinking of monogamy.  But why do you think
that has --

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  Well, it's political.  Basically, they want to be 
able to get, if they have a boyfriend and they
work at AT&amp;T, which is a very pro-gay organization right now,
they want to be able to have that boyfriend have insurance benefits.
I mean, you can hook up with a guy who is your friend who has
AIDS and he has no health insurance, and that's very sad, but
in our country he would never be denied health care, but with
certain corporations you're going to get better health care, so
they can claim that they are in a monogamous relationship, and
therefore, you have to extend benefits to my boyfriend.

<p>

I mean, there are a lot of reasons why they are doing this, but what we
really have to focus in on is this is an attack on Judeo-Christian
values in this country.  This is an assault on traditional Judeo-Christian
marriage, and if the American public falls for this and allows
homosexual marriage to be officially recognized in the courts,
you are opening up a whole can of worms.  You are opening up the
insurance industry, the wills.  A lot of times if someone has
--

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Education.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  -- education -- you know, this is my boyfriend. He 
can bring this boyfriend into class and introduce him to 12-year-old 
children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Sure.

<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  It's a whole can of worms, and it's so
beautifully packaged by organizations like the Human Rights Campaign
Fund.  I mean, I was on a show with the director of that organization,
and she was quoting -- I don't know where she got her statistics
from, but she was quoting a study that says that America really
is for gay marriage.  And when she started giving off her data,
she said, &quot;Well, in this study, 48 percent are undecided.&quot;
I said, &quot;Well, where are you getting this propaganda from?&quot;
I said, &quot;What kind of study would have credibility where
48 percent of the study is undecided?&quot;

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Is &quot;I don't know,&quot; right.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  America is against gay marriage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Oh, yes.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  And, hopefully, they will never accept it, or the 
wrath of God will come upon this country.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Well, interestingly enough, Hawaii has been the 
spearpoint state for driving gay marriage into the country, and 
yet, apparently, the spear point got a little blunted this week. 
Bob, what happened?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Boy, did it!  Well, it started last week. They released 
the latest poll of Hawaiians, and what had been a 71 percent figure 
opposing same-sex marriage rose to 74 percent.  That was reported 
in the major Honolulu newspapers. The percentage just keeps rising 
as people understand the threat that gay marriage, so called, poses.

<p>

But yesterday there was a major victory in the Senate.  There was a 
bill that went through the Senate unanimously, 24 to nothing, banning 
same-sex marriage, reaffirming the state's commitment to one man-one 
woman marriage, and stating the reasons for it.  This was all done 
because a court case is coming up in Hawaii in a circuit court, sent 
down from the Supreme Court, expected to be heard in August, in which 
three couples have challenged the marriage license law.

<p>

The Supreme Court had told the state of Hawaii, find a compelling 
interest to preserve one man-one woman marriage or we are going to 
open it up to same-sex relationships.

<p>

So now the Senate has moved. Liberal Hawaii, liberal Democrats and 
moderate Republicans and some conservatives, all voting to preserve 
marriage.  That has got to send a signal to the courts, and it should 
send a signal to the rest of America that you don't want this, folks.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: People don't, I think, understand [that] to redefine 
marriage is to open -- some things we are going to talk about in the 
next segment, adoption of children, to change our educational system,
to say that any kind of sex practice is morally neutral.  Here
we are struggling with rising STD rates and you have a growing
abstinence movement and just plain an attempt to decrease sexually
transmitted diseases among kids and a crippling infertility rate,
and then we are going to say that all sex practices, despite these
horrible figures, the sex that you have is insignificant.

<p>

There are all these strange counter-trends going on, but I think one
of the interesting significances of Hawaii is, if Hawaii, that
one state, changes their law, the rest of the nation is changed.
Bob, could you explain that for the viewers?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes. Because of the full faith and credit clause of the 
Constitution, states are supposed to recognize licenses from out of 
state, like a driver's license.  If a gay couple from, say, Ohio flies 
to Honolulu, gets married under a brand-new gay marriage law in Hawaii
and goes back to Ohio, they can present their marriage license
and say, &quot;Look, you have to recognize it with all the benefits
and status and privileges it brings.&quot;  That gives Ohio a
huge problem under the full faith and credit clause.  If they
don't recognize it, the gay couple is going to haul them into
court and say, &quot;You're denying us our basic human rights.&quot;

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Based on the Constitution, even.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Based on the Constitution.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  And what is incredible about
that is that a lot of states are adopting anti-gay marriage laws
right now, but, you see, the gays aren't concerned about that.
They are going to go up to the Supreme Court, which will override
the state laws, and that is what they are really up to, taking
this up to the Supreme Court.  They are assaulting the American
public right now.  They are extremely organized, and if they don't
win in Hawaii, they are going to hit California; they are going
to hit another liberal state; and eventually, they are going to
try to break through.  That is what they are up to.

<p>

If the American public doesn't wise up to this, then evil thrives 
when good men and women do nothing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Absolutely. 

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: I can tell you one thing about the --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You're going to have to tell me this after the break, 
because we are going to hear more about this.  When <i>Straight Talk</i> 
returns, we will hear more about how same-sex marriage affects the family 
and America's children.  Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>.

<p>

Legalizing same-sex marriage not only touches the lives of those
involved in the relationships; it also affects America's children
by opening the door to gay adoption and much more.

<p>

To shed light on this, back again are Bob Knight and Anthony Falzarano.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Again.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Again.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Are we eloquent still?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Eloquent and continuing to be eloquent.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But I wanted to let you wrap up one point before we
get into the real reason why so many of us are fighting this,
which is for today's children.  But why is it, Anthony, homosexuals
and lesbians have made tremendous gains in societies?  I mean,
Hollywood and really in the job and a lot of different settings.
Why do they keep coming?  Why now gay marriage?

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: I am the director of an ex-gay ministry.  I am a former 
homosexual myself.  I was gay for nine years before I got saved and 
became a Christian and the blood of Jesus Christ washed over me.

<p>

Basically, I had no problem getting an apartment if I made enough money,
just like anybody else.  No one ever turned me down for an apartment.
There are certain gays out there that just want to push into
the landlord's face that I'm a homosexual and you can't keep me
out.

<p>

Basically, homosexuality is a neurosis.  It's healable, it's
treatable.  We are ministering to 6,000 former homosexuals in
the Exodus network.  Basically, homosexuality is a stunting of
psychosexual growth.  They are children inside, and any parents
out there -- you know, when your kid is spoiled, he'll keep coming
at you and keep coming at you and keep coming at you until you
give him a whack on the bottom and say, &quot;Enough!&quot; and
then the child will stop.

<p>

The American public has got to start treating the homosexual community 
in that way. They've got to say, &quot;Enough is enough.  You have 
enough benefits. You can live in your subculture, but please do not 
push this on our Judeo-Christian values.&quot;

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And the reason why they're stunted, I think you need 
to bring that up.  A lot of people were molested; there were some 
serious events in their lives.  We know from psychological
research that powerful and crushing events do stunt growth.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Of course. Eighty percent of the people that have
come to Transformation in Washington have been sexually abused
as children.  Ninety-eight percent of them did not bond with their
same-sex parent.  And, basically, that is the main cause of homosexuality.
And when we treat those symptoms with the love of the Christian
church, people start to recover from homosexuality.

<p>

We see people go on to heterosexual marriage.  We put marriages back 
together. We see people go on to seminary.  These people don't necessarily
want to be gay.  They are being sold a bill of goods by the political
pro-gay factions that are in this country, and we need to get
the word out that you don't have to be gay and that there are
options, and I believe that many homosexuals, if they knew that
they had an option, would take that option to become ex-gay.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, one of the things that you have been studying has
been the sexualizing of children and the way in which children
have become a political football.  But they are the real goal
here.

<p>

It was interesting, during the gay march here in Washington,
D.C., one of the constant chants was, &quot;Ten percent is not
enough; recruit, recruit, recruit,&quot; which kind of flies in
the face of their biological argument.

<p>

Why are children the key issue here with the gay marriage debate?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, because when you legitimatize gay marriage, you 
really can't say no to adoption of children in same-sex households, 
because you have destroyed the gender distinction, the idea that men 
and women are different, complementary, have something special to offer
each other and to their children.

<p>

It is kind of the Equal Rights Amendment. It is creeping in through the 
back door saying men and women are interchangeable; there is no 
difference, so let's not make any distinctions at all.  That's what 
it's all about. That's why it's not just live and let live, have a gay 
couple down the street get a marriage license.  It's so much bigger than
that. I think what has not been said often enough is that children
really do need a mother and a father.  A little boy needs to have
a father to learn what it is to be a man and to have his growing
masculinity affirmed, and he needs to have a mother for that mother
love, and to watch both parents interact and see how men should
treat women, women should treat men, how they both treat each
other as husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, and their relationship
with their children.

<p>

In a gay household, these same-sex households that are now adopting 
children, the child immediately doesn't have a father or a mother, 
one or the other, so the kid is already at a disadvantage. Then the 
child sees a distorted view of sexuality because of the homosexuality 
going on, and then that child is intensely curious about what men 
and women do together, what relationships they have.

<p>

I know a guy who has just entered jail, tragically,
because he grew up in a lesbian household.  He still loves his
mother and doesn't really blame her, but he said, &quot;You know,
as a boy in a lesbian environment where it was intensely anti-male&quot;
-- that's all he heard, this bitterness toward men -- he said
that he felt totally disenfranchised, began having sexual problems.
He eventually became a voyeur, and he is in on a peeping Tom
charge.  He was so curious about how normal people have sex. We
have other people that are cases like this.

<p>

One case will not a principle make, but this guy is a symptom, and it 
shows that without a dad in the house to set him straight, he really 
ran into a lot of problems.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  That is right.  There is a case in the Rhode Island 
court system right now.  This poor father called me, and he says, 
&quot;I need help.&quot;  Basically, his wife left him for a woman, 
and basically, there is a custody fight over the two girls, two young 
girls in the family.

<p>

Basically, the judge said to this young father, &quot;Look, I'm not 
concerned if your wife is a lesbian.  I want to find out who is the most
suitable parent to take custody over these children.&quot;  And
he describes how unstable his former wife's girlfriend is, and
to expose two pure young girls to a lesbian relationship -- it's
child abuse, and I can't believe the courts would even consider
giving custody to this woman.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  But if you get same-sex marriage, the courts are going 
to have no choice.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: They'll have no options.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Because marriage is a privilege,
and it's a benefit, and the state really does set a big fence
around it to protect it.  So if the state thinks enough of that
relationship to give it all these special benefits and says this
is okay, you will have no defense against homosexuals saying,
&quot;We want children, too.  We're going to have them, and by
the way, we're going to teach them that homosexuality is okay
in the schools.&quot;

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  But the reason why we benefit [from] marriage is 
because marriages benefit society.  It is not a random social gift. 
People fare better, children fare better.

<p>

I want to thank my guests.  I want to encourage people to call
and write these different organizations for more about this. 
When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> will show you some video clips 
highlighting the homosexual marriage and adoption issues. Don't go 
away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council></i>.

<p>

Robert Knight has appeared on many confrontational
television shows, and tonight we will share a couple of those
with you as Bob discussed some same-sex marriage and homosexual
adoption issues.  Let's take a look at clips from ABC's 
<i>Nightline</i> and <i>Oprah</i> as we bring you Homefront News.

<p>

[Segment from ABC <i>Nightline</i>, September 25, 1995, follows:]

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Marriage is the uniting of the two sexes.
That's the definition.  So when homosexuals say, &quot;We want
the right to marry,&quot; they've already got it, but they don't
meet the requirements.  The requirements are --

<p>

MR. KOPPEL: Defined by whom?  Defined by whom?  Requirements as 
defined by whom?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Every major culture on the planet, all major religions. 
I mean, Ted, come on.  You're talking as if marriage hadn't existed, 
something we invented to oppress homosexuals, and that's nonsense.  
It is the building block.

<p>

MR. KOPPEL:  No, no, no.  What I am doing, Mr. Knight --
and forgive me; we should let our other guests have a chance to
get in here, too -- but what I am saying is that marriage -- you
refer to marriage as though it was some unchanging institution
that has not in any manner been modified over the years, and clearly,
it has.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, it has not been modified to the extent
that the homosexuals are asking, which is to eliminate an entire
gender from it.  It's the bringing together of the two sexes.
Once you don't do that, you leave an entire gender out, that
makes it something else entirely.  It's not the same psychological
dynamics, emotional dynamics.  Homosexuals do not do what mom
and dad do in the bedroom.  They don't provide children the role
models that mom and dad do.  It's an entirely different animal
and doesn't deserve the same benefits that society gives marriages.

<p>

[Segment from Oprah, January 26, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: -- and that is why kids ought to be in marriages, not in 
gay households.  They need mothers and fathers.  Okay?

<p>

I want to ask the viewers.  I want to ask the viewers, do they really 
think their mom could be replaced by two gay men; or their dad, their
father, by two women?  Sexuality is not a small thing.  Boys need
fathers.  Girls do, too, so they understand men.

<p>

GUEST: People need loving parents.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Love is great, okay?  Love is great, but sexuality is 
important.  There are two different, complementary
sexes.  You guys are pretending people are interchangeable and
there's no difference.

<p>

GUEST: There's no pretending anywhere.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  There are a lot of people who are screwed up with
their gender identity because they didn't bond with their fathers
or their mothers.

<p>

GUEST: The question here is we're talking about
protecting children.  Lesbian and gay families do exist, and the
question is, are we going to protect the children here?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes, we should.

<p>

GUEST: Are we going to entitle the children to child support?

<p>

MS. WINFREY:  I will tell you this.  May I just
interrupt this?  I've done this show before.  I've been down this
road, and years ago we did this show and I was so moved by the
children.  If you ask the children, the children will tell you
they want to be in a family where people love them, whether they
are two men, two women, a woman and a man.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

If you ask the children, that's what the children will tell you. 
The children just want people -- want to be loved and nurtured and
guided.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Okay, if a child told you, &quot;I'd rather
have three or four parents than two,&quot; would you say, &quot;Oh,
that's okay.  The kid wants it, so it must be right&quot;?  Who
do we decide?  Aren't we adults?  Come on, parents know better
than children know what they need.

<p>

GUEST: Listen. Look at society --

<p>

MS. WINFREY:  I'm just saying, ask the children.  Ask the
children, if they have a choice between being in a home with a
man and a woman who did not care for them or a man and woman who
had all these problems, divorce and fighting, arguing, abuse and
all that --

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  You can't compare a worst-case scenario
with something that's totally different.  You could say, well,
is a kid better off in a burning house or over here in a safe
gay household?  I mean, you could invent thousands of scenarios
like that.  Let's not be absurd.  There's a mountain of evidence.

<p>

MS. WINFREY:  Robert, I wasn't trying to be absurd, you know.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, I'm sorry.  That's how it came across to me.
There are mountains of evidence that show that kids do best in
mom-and-dad families.  You can't deny it.

<p>

<I><p>20 March, 2006.</I>
<p>

My cryptagent made the discovery.  It sure looked like a break-in:  the wreckage of 512bit crypto code, address shreds from bolted folders, a corrupted cache. I sure hope the CC boys found what they were looking for.
<P>
How did it happen that the Government now routinely reads what we write and say in the ether?  That sure wasn't the intention, back when the Telecommunications Act of 1996 passed.  The idea then was that very restricted language would be inserted that would protect our children.  I even remember the scene at a certain Wednesday meeting:  The "Family" alliance was making a big stink about "smut on the internet," and when we barely whispered, "censorship," they got even angrier.<I>  "See this language," they </i>and their conference committee champions said,<i> "this does nothing to inhibit free speech.  We're just taking the Pacifica definition of obscenity that everyone agrees with.  And look!  We even put in a paragraph that tells the FCC it has no power to enforce any of this!"</i>
<P>
How could you argue with that, especially when that particular staffer's hands were shaking with righteousness?  We all had similar run-ins.  We didn't want to alienate our friends on the side of the angels, so we let it pass.
<P>
We forgot the great truth about government in the last century:  legislation to do good for all ends up as government's authority to control us.  The Income Tax, Prohibition, the Draft, Citizens with Disabilities, the Clean Air Act, the Tobacco Control Act of '02;  all were designed to help people, boost the general welfare, promote civic virtue.  
<P>
But they were designed to achieve all these good things by fiat from above.  Today, so many of us think these laws pure tyranny, but the laws themselves did not enslave us.  We need to look elsewhere for that, to the ethos of rule.
<P>
The late-lamented twentieth century saw the maturation and old age of an industrial world.  It was a world of pyramids run from the top down, where those who made it to the top were called "the best and the brightest."  Law and Ivy credentials gave them the authority to call themselves<i> managers </i> (the equestrian rank of those days).  But they were not content to use this authority merely to rule.  They wanted to<i> help</I> people;  and they knew,
<i>O best and brightest,</I> that they had the smarts and the heart to do it.
<P>
They were<i> Progressives.</I>  The whole of the last century was informed by the urgent need for smart people to uplift everyone else.  And only they knew how.  And only they could do it.
<P>
This ethos of rule naturally inclined toward laws that would let the best and brightest do their good work right away.  But to do this, progressives needed not just authority;  they needed control.  Their reasoning:  <i>People will never do right on their own:  just look at the chaos and abuse of an open system.  People have to be told what to do.  The more they do what we say, the better things will be.</I>       
<P>
No, this was not Stalin's kind of control.  Not exactly.
<P>
Even now it is hard for us to believe that people who called themselves <i>Liberal and Progressive </I>for so long longed only to bring us a kinder and gentler Gulag.  But look at what they have done:
<P>
It's true, the language in the Telecom Act of '96 was careful.  FCC enforcement of the censorship provision <i>(what else can I call it!)</I> was forbidden.  The problem was, it was there in the first place.  We failed because we were worrying about the wrong problem.
<P>
We worried about "porn on the internet;"  or we were vulnerable, in some celestial way, to entreaties for the welfare of our children.  So we let a bill pass that gave progressive government still more authority over our lives.  The "Family" alliance was thinking,<i> Save our Children!,</I> but someone else was thinking,<i> I can do the protecting!</I>    
<P>
We then gave the Fed the implicit charge to go out and protect us some more.  Not the FCC.  Oh no.  The law said they could not enforce.  But there were scads of Federal agencies aching to enforce.  And enforce they did.  If the FCC was barred from enforcement, it was not denied the right of assistance.  And assist they did.
<P>
And those NSA geeks (don't tell me it was just CC boys) busting into my cache?  I knew it would happen eventually.  My encryption engine exceeded the Federal legal rating  and it was in use.  Like the old radar detectors, we all have them;  they're only illegal if you use them.  And since they're too hard to crack in volume, we get by.  We need 512 bits, for plain old privacy.
<P>
So that was how the Telecom language intended to protect us become our scourge:  All porn has to be encrypted, but encryption that works is illegal to use!  Since the porn guys have been giving away 512b engines and keys for free, the Feds say this means most kids can get it<i> (if you ignore the '000s of parental control products!). </I> So our Protectors have their probable cause <i>and</I> their slogan:<i>  For the children!</I>
<P>
I just hope it took them a nice long time to break in.  I left them a nice <i>.gif </I>of Manet's <i>Olympia.</I>  Good thing I've got the latest 1024b kernel on my hand-held.  At least they haven't started search and seizure
<P>
Yet.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This year's presidential campaign has raised once again the issue of free trade versus protectionism, with protectionists arguing that reducing foreign imports protects American jobs and benefits the overall U.S. economy. What are the facts?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is no evidence that protectionism produces economic benefits that outweigh its costs, but there is plenty of evidence that it does more harm than good. There is near unanimity among economists, for example, that free and unrestricted trade benefits economies while protectionism hurts them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
America has a long history of advocating free trade, and, despite the claims of many, has been a free trade country throughout most of its history. When America has strayed from the path of free trade, the result has been economic hardship. Yet America today is on the brink of reviving protectionist policies that have failed in the past. The consequences would be all too predictable: lower living standards for all Americans, higher levels of unemployment, more business bankruptcies, and lingering economic decay.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The policies advanced by opponents of free trade ultimately are based on a number of myths: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #1: Free trade has destroyed America's manufacturing base. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not true. Today manufacturing measured as a percentage of the U.S. economy is about the same today as it was in 1967.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #2: High manufacturing wages must be protected from foreign competition regardless of the cost to the overall economy. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not true. The cost of saving jobs from foreign competition is higher consumer prices, which harm the economy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #3: Free trade is causing America to lose its technological edge. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not true. America today is the most technologically advanced country in the world, recapturing the lead in many high-tech industries like semiconductors.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #4: Trade deficits are harmful while trade surpluses are beneficial.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Not true. Trade deficits are more a sign of strength than they are of weakness. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #5: Trade deficits cost jobs. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not true. The data show that as the trade deficit increases, unemployment decreases. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #6: Japan's prosperity is based on trade surpluses generated by managed trade policies.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Not true. Japan is suffering economically because of its managed trade policies.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #7: American companies will go bankrupt unless the U.S. government limits import competition and forces foreign countries to purchase more U.S. goods. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not true. Many industries once thought to be in danger of bankruptcy are making record profits.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #8: Countries like Japan are called protectionist simply because the U.S. has experienced difficulty penetrating their markets. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not true. American companies sell almost $70 billion a year in Japan, America's largest market besides Canada.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #9: Trade surpluses are always the result of government policy.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Not true. Some countries are likely to run a trade deficit because they import cheaper raw materials and export more expensive finished goods. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #10: Trade retaliation is the most effective way to open foreign markets. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not true. Trade retaliation most often fails to open foreign markets.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #11: International trade arrangements like the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Area violate American sovereignty. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not true. No international organization has final policy-making authority over the United States. In all cases, the U.S. Congress and the President have final authority.
<P>

<b>THE MYTHS OF TRADE PROTECTIONISM</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The protectionist approach to settling trade disputes with Japan, China, and other countries rests on a number of myths about free trade and trade deficits. These myths are the intellectual foundation of protectionism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #1</b>: Free trade has destroyed America's manufacturing base. Opponents of free trade argue that cheaper labor in foreign countries forces American companies to move their operations overseas. They contend that in the long run, America is being de-industrialized. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. First of all, labor is not the only factor in producing manufactured goods. Other factors such as capital, natural resources, and infrastructure also must be considered. If labor was the only or even the most important factor, all the world's manufacturers would be located in such low-wage countries as Haiti, Somalia, and the Dominican Republic. Manufacturers avoid these poor countries because of the many problems that add to the cost of doing business there. For example, port facilities or roads may be inadequate or non-existent, driving up the costs of transporting goods to market; there may be no telephone or fax service; and local and federal taxes may be so high that they cancel out any savings from cheap labor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>America's Manufacturing Might.</b> Even more important, America is not de-industrializing. Manufacturing as a percentage of the U.S. economy is essentially the same today -- about 21 percent of GDP -- as it was in 1967.<sup>1</sup>  Moreover, employment in manufacturing has remained relatively stable over the last three decades. The number of Americans working in manufacturing jobs today (about 10.5 million) is about the same as in the early 1960s.<sup>2</sup>  Thus, even though these jobs represent a smaller percentage of the growing U.S. population, these Americans now are building computers and advanced medical devices instead of working in assembly lines sewing clothes or soldering circuit boards. If it is true that manufacturing is about the same percent of the U.S. economy as it was nearly 30 years ago, and that there are fewer workers as a percentage of the total U.S. population performing those tasks, then it is also true that the American worker is becoming more productive. This is a sign of strength, not weakness.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #2</b>: High manufacturing wages must be protected regardless of the cost to the overall economy. Protectionists believe that American manufacturing wages must be protected from foreign competition regardless of the costs to the rest of the country. They also argue that foreign competition causes Americans to lose their jobs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. The cost of saving jobs from foreign competition is higher consumer prices, which harm the economy. For example, when trade quotas were imposed on imported cars in the early 1980s, prices for domestic and imported cars rose by $2,000.<sup>3</sup>  While these quotas may have preserved some auto workers' jobs, they also passed the cost on to the American consumer. Instead of being able to use this money to send their children to college, pay their mortgages, or put food on the table, American consumers are forced to subsidize the jobs of other Americans who cannot compete internationally. In short, protectionism takes money from the many to support the high wages or jobs of the few.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, trying to save a few jobs through protectionism may cause a net loss of many more jobs. When the U.S. imposed import quotas on the auto industry in the 1980s, the price of a new U.S. automobile increased by an average of 41 percent from 1981 to 1984. This was nearly twice the average rate of increase for all consumer prices during that time. While the auto industry can claim that these price hikes saved up to 22,000 jobs, they also prevented many consumers from buying new cars.<sup>4</sup>  In fact, U.S. consumers bought around 1 million fewer U.S. cars after the U.S. imposed import quotas,<sup>5</sup> and the drop in sales forced the auto industry to lay off 50,000 workers in the late 1980s.<sup>6</sup>  Thus, even though 22,000 jobs apparently were saved, the layoffs caused by the price increase actually produced a net loss of 30,000 jobs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What is more, the price increases cost the American consumers $17 billion in higher auto prices. To save just one of those 22,000 auto jobs, American consumers had to pay $772,727. It would have been cheaper if the American taxpayer, through the U.S. government, could have given these auto workers a one-time check for $500,000 and then laid them off. Either way, whether by imposing tariffs or by paying laid-off workers directly, the U.S. government would be subsidizing relatively few workers at great expense to Americans generally.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Similarly, the number of retail jobs destroyed by years of import restrictions on textile and apparel products is far greater than the number of jobs created or saved in the textile manufacturing industry. Americans pay 58 percent higher prices for textile and apparel products because of U.S. trade restrictions. This amounts to $11 billion to $15 billion a year.<sup>7</sup>  Thus, while protectionism saved 22,390 U.S. textile and apparel jobs in the 1980s, it cost the U.S. consumer $550,916 per job saved. However, once job losses in other industries, like the retail sector, are added to the equation, the cost of each job saved increases to well over $4 million.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It should be up to individual Americans, not government, to determine how much they pay for consumer goods. It is unfair to ask a school teacher making $26,000 a year to pay $2,000 more for a car to subsidize an auto worker who makes $50,000 a year.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #3</b>: Free trade is causing America to lose its technological edge. Advocates of protectionism argue that the United States is losing its technological edge to countries like Japan, mainly as a result of the U.S. dedication to free trade. These advocates argue that foreign competition has forced many U.S. high-tech firms into bankruptcy or out of the business of producing certain goods. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. America today is the most technologically advanced country in the world, a leader in the production of such high-tech products as advanced audio and video equipment, air conditioners, building and construction hardware, computers and computer software, environmental technology equipment, medical equipment and chemicals, navigational and surveying equipment, and telecommunications equipment. Moreover, American firms are recapturing the lead in many technological fields in which they had fallen behind during the 1980s. 
<p>
Two examples:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Example 1: Semiconductors.</b> Semiconductors are electrical components used to conduct electricity. They are used not only in the most basic of electrical products, such as toasters, but in the most advanced devices, such as supercomputers or orbital satellites. All electrical products incorporate some type of semiconductor, so this industry obviously is vital to the economic well-being of any country.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Today, America is the world's largest manufacturer and seller of semiconductors. Many argue that an aggressive U.S. protectionist policy has raised the industry to its present status. In fact, however, it was U.S. private-sector joint ventures and sound business decisions by the U.S. semiconductor industry that resulted in this current prosperity. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By the 1980s, Japan had become America's biggest rival in semiconductors. Japanese firms began to invest aggressively in computer memory chips, trying to beat out the remaining U.S. producers in this area. Sensing an impending downturn in demand, many U.S. firms abandoned production of these relatively low-tech items in favor of more profitable higher-tech products. One such product was the microprocessor. While the downturn in demand for memory chips did occur in the mid-1980s, and the Japanese endured major losses, American semiconductor manufacturers profited because they focused on producing microprocessors, not memory chips.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
However, after U.S. industry had walked away from the memory chip, sales in Japan dropped. The U.S. responded to this problem in 1986 by seeking a U.S.-Japan agreement that would force the Japanese to buy more semiconductors from the United States. But this agreement had little, if any impact on increased U.S. semiconductor sales in Japan. What did increase American semiconductor sales in Japan was a series of private-sector U.S. joint ventures with Japanese companies. These ventures gave U.S. companies access to crucial Japanese manufacturing techniques and distribution channels, in addition to shared research and development costs. In 1990, there was just a handful of U.S./Japan semiconductor partnerships; by 1994, there where over four dozen. It was these partnerships that enabled American companies to sell more semiconductors in Japan.<sup>10</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Example 2: Steel.</b> In the 1970s and 1980s, America's steel industry was unable to compete with cheaper, foreign made steel. Many steel workers were laid off, some permanently. Today, the U.S. steel industry is stronger, with growing sales and more profitability. Many advocates of protectionism argue that U.S. steel was saved by trade restrictions. In fact, however, protectionism in steel harmed the U.S. economy while failing to help the U.S. steel industry. What did help the U.S. steel industry?  Joint ventures with foreign firms and massive foreign investment.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To help the U.S. steel industry cope with shrinking competitiveness in the 1970s, the Nixon Administration imposed relief from imports for a period of three years, during which the industry was supposed to modernize. In 1971, these import restraints were extended for another three years. From 1974 until 1993, the U.S. steel industry was under some kind of government protection. Wages rose from $9.90 per hour in 1970 to $17.46 per hour in 1980, an increase more than 60 percent higher than wage increases in the rest of the U.S. manufacturing sector.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The combination of higher steel wages and 20 years of protectionism cost more jobs among users of steel than were saved in the steel industry.<sup>11</sup>  Moreover, Americans paid some $5 billion a year in higher prices. Thus, while protection may have saved jobs in the steel industry, it destroyed jobs in other industries that use steel to manufacture their products. For example, from 1969 to 1980, U.S. manufacturers using U.S.-made steel paid 20 to 25 percent more for their steel than was paid by their foreign competitors.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Still, the U.S. steel industry did manage to make a tremendous comeback.<sup>12</sup>  The industry once again is making profits and, after years of modernization, is prepared to compete with foreign steel producers. The reason: Japanese foreign investment poured into the U.S. in the 1980s and gave U.S. steel companies the money they needed to build new plants and adopt more advanced manufacturing techniques. Moreover, private sector joint ventures between U.S. and Japanese steel companies taught U.S. firms how to manufacture steel more efficiently.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #4</b>: Trade deficits are harmful and trade surpluses are beneficial. This is the core idea behind protectionism and managed trade. Advocates of this view argue that trade deficits harm the economy, destroy jobs, and reflect weakness in the economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. Trade deficits are more a sign of strength than of weakness. The U.S. trade deficit means that Americans hold more goods than their foreign trading partners, while foreigners hold more U.S. dollars. As the richest country in the world, America consumes goods and services from both U.S. and foreign companies. The influx of foreign goods and services in return for dollars adds to America's wealth. It does not detract from it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Americans receive imported goods and services that increase their standard of living. Moreover, the dollars sent abroad for the purchase of goods and services typically cannot be spent within those countries. While dollars are traded between countries in financial markets, they are used mainly by foreign consumers to buy American goods and services. Thus, nations use surplus dollars to buy American goods and services, invest in American firms, or purchase U.S. Treasury bonds. These investments create jobs and wealth for Americans, while the purchase of Treasury bonds frees U.S. domestic capital for savings, investment, and purchases.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider the example of someone who goes to the supermarket and buys $150 worth of groceries. The protectionist believes the proprietor has a trade "surplus" of $150, and the customer has a "deficit" of $150. But this is not the case. The grocer ends up with $150 in currency, while the customer has $150 worth of groceries. It is a mutually beneficial transaction. No one would expect the grocer to buy an equal amount of goods from the customer in order to have an equal balance sheet in exchanged goods. Nor should one expect countries to have an even balance sheet in international trade. The trade deficit represents nothing more than a surplus of foreign goods and services which Americans now own. The value of these goods and services is as much a part of the national wealth as is the possession of U.S. dollars.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Another misunderstanding involves the calculation of the trade deficit. At least one-third to one-half of the U.S. trade deficit figure counts U.S. imports from American overseas subsidiaries as part of the deficit. For example, when Ford Mexico sends a motor from its plant to the Ford assembly plant in Detroit, it is counted as an import. However, if Ford then sells an American-made car with a Mexican-made motor in the U.S., there is no corresponding export. Thus, a "deficit" supposedly is created. But why should a car sold in the U.S., even though it has a Mexican-made engine, be calculated as part of the trade deficit?  Most of the money made from this sale stays in the U.S.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Trade deficits are not harmful to the economy. If they were, America would not be the economic powerhouse it is today. The U.S. has run a trade deficit for most of its history. For the first hundred years, these deficits were fairly large; nevertheless, throughout this period, growth rates were higher than they are today. Trade deficits did not destroy the economy then. Nor will they destroy it in the future.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #5</b>: Trade deficits cost jobs. Protectionists claim that trade deficits are a major cause of unemployment.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. History shows that, on average, unemployment drops as trade deficits rise. For example, while the trade deficit leaped in 1983-1984 and peaked in 1987, the U.S. unemployment rate plummeted, from 9.6 percent in 1983 to 5.5 percent in 1988. When the trade deficit began to shrink from 1989 to 1991, on the other hand, unemployment rose from 5.3 percent to 6.7 percent, and when it began to rise again from 1992 to 1994, unemployment fell from 7.4 percent to 6.1 percent. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Looking further back in history confirms that trade deficits do not cause a loss of jobs. Every year the trade deficit increased since 1962, unemployment decreased. Likewise, every year the trade deficit decreased since 1962, unemployment increased shortly thereafter.<sup>13</sup>  Despite the trade deficit, the economy was growing and jobs were being created.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Why, then, are some major corporations laying off large numbers of workers?  The answer has nothing to do with trade deficits and everything to do with America's own economic ills. The U.S. economy today suffers from a host of government policies and regulations that are strangling corporate America. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Faced with a proliferation of environmental regulations, financial reporting requirements, and worker safety laws, American companies are finding it more and more expensive and difficult to comply with government directives. While many regulations may have laudable goals, their implementation is causing severe hardship for America's corporations. This, combined with added costs, causes far more job losses than trade deficits.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #6</b>: Prosperity is based on trade surpluses generated by managed trade policies. U.S. policymakers often use the managed trade policies of Japan as an example of how a country can eliminate trade deficits, increase living standards, and achieve greater economic stability.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. A closer look reveals that Japan's managed trade policies have had mixed results. The real purchasing power of Japanese consumers is at least 20 percent less than that of the American consumer. For example, using purchasing power parity, which takes into account differences in currency values, local prices, availability of goods and services, and inflation, America has a per capita income of $25,860. Japan, however, has a per capita income of only $21,350.<sup>14</sup>  This means that the Japanese have a lower standard of living than Americans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Japan's lower standard of living can be attributed partly to a highly regulated economy that drives up the cost of living. For example, policies that restrict such imports as agricultural products, beef, and other food items force the average Japanese to spend about 25 percent of his disposable income on food, compared to less than 12 percent for Americans. Spending more on food means less money for housing and other needs. The result: a lower standard of living.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Managed trade is not responsible for Japan's prosperity. In fact, Japan's prosperity exists in spite of Japan's managed trade and industrial policies. In the end, the freer trade and market economic policies of the U.S. have produced a higher standard of living in America than in Japan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #7</b>: American companies will go bankrupt unless the U.S. government limits competition from foreign imports and forces foreign countries to purchase more U.S. goods. Advocates of managed trade argue that closed overseas markets are the chief reason for America's trade deficit, causing enormous economic hardships that result in bankruptcies and lost jobs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. This scare tactic is employed by U.S. companies to frighten policymakers into taking up their cause in Washington. And what is their cause?  To limit import competition and force foreign countries to purchase a set amount of U.S. goods and services. These companies argue that they are hurt by closed markets overseas. As a result, they want Congress and the Administration to punish American consumers by forcing them to pay higher prices for imported products like automobiles.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But if American companies are so beset by closed markets overseas, why is America the world's largest exporter?  The U.S. exported over $783 billion in goods and services in the first 11 months of 1995.<sup>15</sup>  By contrast, Germany exported only $414 billion and Japan only $397 billion in all of 1994.<sup>16</sup>  Clearly, most U.S. exporters experience little if any difficulty finding overseas markets for their goods.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider the U.S. auto industry. Is it on the verge of bankruptcy today?  It is not. It racked up $14 billion in profits last year. The main reason for Detroit's resurgence was not government coddling. Rather, it is because manufacturers are building better automobiles. This is the result of competition from Europe and Japan. Today, American cars are better built, have fewer flaws, and are bigger sellers than many of their Japanese and European counterparts. For all this, the Big Three auto makers have the free market to thank, not the meddling hand of the federal government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #8</b>: Because the U.S. is unable to sell some goods and services in countries like Japan, these countries must have closed markets. Many protectionists argue that the U.S. has an open market while countries like Japan restrict American imports. Thus, they blame Japan for its trade surplus with the U.S.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. Japan is no more protectionist than the United States. This is the conclusion of The Heritage Foundation's <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/econ_index/toc.html.cgi"><i>Index of Economic Freedom</i></a>, which measures the relative level of economic freedom in over 100 countries. The study concludes that, from a global perspective, Japan and the U.S. have relatively equal levels of protectionism.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The trade deficit with Japan is not nearly as bad as protectionists argue. For example, the commonly reported trade deficit figures measure only merchandise trade. While these figures represent the bulk of the trade between the U.S. and Japan, they also ignore the tremendous trade surplus the U.S. has in consulting, telecommunications, computers, and other services. Thus, the deficit is usually smaller than commonly reported. Moreover, much of the trade deficit with Japan comes from counting the products of Japan-based American companies exporting their goods back home. The profits from these sales go to the stockholders of American companies, not directly to the Japanese.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The truth is that Japan is America's largest overseas export market. Japan imported $69 billion in goods from America in 1995 -- that is more than the U.S. exported to Britain and Germany combined ($22 billion and $19 billion, respectively).<sup>18</sup>  Moreover, on a per capita basis, Japan buys more from the U.S. than America buys from Japan. For example, each Japanese citizen bought $444 worth of U.S. goods and services in 1994, while each American citizen purchased only $441 worth of Japanese goods and services.<sup>19</sup>  But because Japan's population is about 50 percent smaller than America's, a deficit exists. Americans purchase more Japanese goods overall because there are twice as many Americans as Japanese. Thus, a trade deficit exists for many reasons, not just because of -- or even primarily because of -- Japanese protectionism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #9</b>: Trade surpluses are always the result of government policy. Protectionists argue that trade surpluses are created intentionally by government policy. Thus, they reason, trade deficits must be dealt with in the same manner -- by government action through tariffs and other forms of protectionism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. Those who argue that trade surpluses and deficits are the result of government manipulation do not understand how a market economy works. They ignore, for example, that some countries with scarce natural resources are likely to run a trade surplus because they must import relatively inexpensive unfinished goods and export more expensive finished goods. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Japan is a case in point. It must import such raw materials as oil and lumber. These raw materials are used to manufacture more expensive finished products, some of which are exported. Throughout this process, the Japanese are adding value to the imported raw materials by making more expensive finished products for export. The result is a trade surplus. By contrast, the U.S. has abundant natural resources, which in many cases it exports. Thus, most of its imports are finished goods, which are more expensive and worth more than the raw materials that went into making them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #10</b>: Trade retaliation is the most effective way to open foreign markets. Protectionists believe the best way to open foreign markets is to threaten trade retaliation. The weapons of choice: special tariffs, duties, and import quotas.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. The U.S. has resorted to threats of trade retaliation to open foreign markets, but most of the time they have backfired. The principal U.S. law used to threaten trade retaliation is Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, which grants the President the authority to impose punitive trade restrictions on imports. Of the nearly 80 Section 301 cases initiated by the U.S. since 1974, only about 15 were successful. Yet even in these cases, American consumers were saddled with billions of dollars in higher prices caused by higher tariffs and special duties. In the end, all Americans were the losers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #11</b>: International trade arrangements like the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Area violate American sovereignty. Advocates of trade protectionism argue that the U.S. should pull out of these and related institutions and agreements because they all infringe on American sovereignty and represent a move toward world government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. A world government would indeed be a grotesque and harmful development, but these agreements or organizations will not lead to such a result.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nothing in any of America's trade agreements, including the NAFTA, can force America to follow any law not previously passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by the President. All of these agreements contain language stating that no decisions made under them can supersede domestic U.S. law. How can a foreign organization like the WTO infringe on U.S. sovereignty if it lacks the power to supersede or overrule U.S. law? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Free trade is, in fact, the antithesis of world government. It depends on the free flow of ideas as well as goods and services. This promotion of freedom worldwide is inconsistent with the centralizing principle of world government.

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The driving force behind the protectionist threat of trade sanctions against Japan, China, and other countries is a misguided belief that trade deficits are harmful to the economy. Nothing could be further from the truth. Trade deficits are a sign of economic strength. They often represent a growing economy in which jobs and wealth are being created, not lost.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Another myth that inspires the protectionist is that trade deficits are mainly the result of closed markets overseas. This also is not true. There are many markets for U.S. goods and services overseas. In fact, the U.S. is the largest exporter in the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Trade protectionists misunderstand America's position in the international economy. By failing to understand America's massive export strength, they fail to comprehend the implications of America's trade deficit. And they have mistaken the reasons why Japan and other countries have a trade surplus. As a result of these misjudgments, protectionists advocate a trade policy that could threaten the wealth and prosperity of all Americans. Their myths are not merely academic, but profoundly important in a practical sense. Getting the facts straight in this debate is vitally important to the future prosperity of the American people.

<i>

&quot;We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed;<br>
we are perplexed, but not in despair;<br>
Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed.&quot;

<p>

-2 Corinthians 4: 8-9

</center><p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

I write to you this month on a subject that weighs heavily on
my heart.  That subject is the persecution of believers around
the world, including here in the United States.  As I've learned
more about the nature and extent of this persecution, it has become
increasingly clear to me that as Christians, we must do more for
our suffering brothers and sisters both here and abroad.  From
China to Saudi Arabia to Sudan, one's profession of faith in Jesus
Christ is becoming an ever more dangerous act in the eyes of the
state.  It is time for men and women of faith to speak up!

<p>

Michael Horowitz is one man who has courageously raised his voice
on this issue.  Mike and I go back many years, to the days when
we both served in the Reagan administration.  My primary responsibilities
were education and the family.  Mike's were economic and regulatory
matters in the Office of Management and Budget.  We worked together
on several issues, and I observed the character of this man up
close.  For that reason, it didn't surprise me at all last summer
when Mike Horowitz, who is Jewish, wrote a heart-rending article
on anti-Christian persecution for <I>The Wall Street Journal.</I>

<p>

Mike was appalled by the harassment, physical abuse and
even death being routinely inflicted on Christians overseas.
But he was even more appalled by the continued refusal of our
government to focus on and do anything about this persecution.
And I have been deeply disappointed by the timidity and silence
that unfortunately have reigned among so many Christians in America,
who, myself included, needed to hear the eloquence of Mike Horowitz
to be shaken with the conviction that we must act.

<p>

This past January, I attended a meeting of evangelical leaders
in Washington, DC that Mike cosponsored with Freedom House.  Freedom
House is a widely respected human rights organization, founded
at the outbreak of World War II.  The information they shared
regarding systematic persecution of Christians was overwhelming:

<p><ul>

<li>Incidents of intimidation, arrest, and torture are growing
under various regimes around the world.  The worst offenders are 
Islamic fundamentalist governments and communist regimes. Millions 
of Christians worldwide are routinely subjected to this persecution, 
most of which goes unreported in the United States.

<p>

<li>In Sudan, 1.5 million people have died as a result of the Islamic
north's <i>jihad</i>, or &quot;holy war,&quot; against the largely 
Christian south.[1] The war has displaced another 5 million. Children 
of Christian parents are being conscripted for service in the
Islamic government army.  One mother, of boys eight and nine,
was imprisoned and savagely beaten when she went to retrieve them 
from a <i>mujahadeen</i> training camp.[2] She was pregnant at the 
time. Thousands of children of Christian parents, as young as six, 
have been taken and sold as slaves in Sudan, Libya and elsewhere.[3]

<p>

<li>Three of the most prominent evangelical leaders in Iran were
abducted and murdered in 1994.  The law there effectively prohibits
Christians from attending any kind of religious service, and those 
who dare to evangelize have been arrested, brutally tortured, and 
forced to renounce their faith.[4]

<p>

<li>Christians who flee Iran through Turkey are forced by the American
Embassy there to undergo interviews by Turkish security police who are
sympathetic toward Iran's laws against &quot;blasphemy.&quot;  Many of 
these refugees fail these interviews and face forcible return to Iran. 
American Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) field offices 
commonly treat refugees the same way.[5] In other words, the only things 
we are &quot;exporting&quot; to Iran are Christians!

<p>

<li>The government of Egypt, which has received billions of dollars
in U.S. assistance (our tax money!), has attempted to appease 
domestic Islamic fundamentalists by imprisoning and torturing Christian 
converts and evangelists.

<p>

<li>In China, persecution of the country's estimated 30 million
Christians is a matter of official public policy.  Catholics in the 
People's Republic are permitted to join only the official state church, 
whose bishops are appointed by Beijing and not by the pope. If they 
refuse to &quot;register,&quot; they are routinely imprisoned and
tortured or, in the classic communist style, &quot;re-educated
through labor&quot; -- the official euphemism for doing hard time in 
the labor camps.

</ul><p>

Recently, FRC's chief of government relations, Marty Dannenfelser,
testified before a House International Relations subcommittee
on this plague of persecution.  He made it clear that our government
has not done enough to highlight and to halt these disgraceful
abuses.  We reject the idea that these problems will go away through
quiet diplomacy, or that abuses will only increase if our government
openly criticizes the perpetrators.  History shows that speaking
out is the only way to deter tyrants.

<p>

Our own government must cease its tolerance of the mistreatment
of religious minorities around the world.  Saudi Arabia is a prime
example.  Recently the Saudis pressured the United States about
&quot;objectionable&quot; activities by American nationals stationed
there.  One complaint involved the operation of a U.S.-sponsored
nightclub frequented by American servicemen.  Our government dug
in its heels and refused to bow to Saudi requests to close it.
At the same time, the Saudis demanded that we stop holding Sunday
worship services at our embassy in Riyadh -- that is, on U.S. soil!
To this, the Clinton Administration buckled under.

<p>

I mentioned at the beginning of this letter that the United States
is also troubled by anti-Christian persecution.  The major difference,
of course, is that the examples I am about to cite are not sponsored
or tolerated by our government.  Nevertheless, their impact on
the religious liberties we hold so dear can be just as devastating.
In the past few years, the United States has experienced a wave
of violent attacks on Christian churches.  According to an investigative
report compiled by <I>USA Today</I>, some 25 black churches, primarily
in the South, have been the targets of arson.  The pace of these
attacks is clearly accelerating.

<p>

The wave seems to have begun on April 4, 1993, the 25th anniversary
of the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Twelve churches were burned last year, and so far this year at
least seven more have been torched.  In roughly two thirds of
these incidents, no arrests have been made.  This month, of course,
brings another anniversary of Dr. King's death, and many fear
that the attacks on churches will worsen.  Again, the only way
to prevent this tragedy from happening is for each of us to speak
out against these crimes and for the government to bring the 
perpetrators to justice.

<p>

In February, FRC joined with several evangelical, Jewish, Catholic
and civil rights groups in calling for congressional hearings
into these incidents.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation has
also begun to investigate them, but the added visibility of Congressional
hearings can serve a number of useful purposes.  After our call
for hearings, the Congressional Family Caucus, whose roster includes
several dozen freshman members of Congress, also issued a plea
for hearings.  As I'm writing this, FRC has received assurances
from House Judiciary Committee staff that in-depth hearings will
occur later this spring.

<p>

FRC is also calling upon the Clinton administration to speak
out forcefully on these events.  Attorney General Janet Reno shoulders
a special responsibility to ensure that potential arsonists know
that the full weight of federal law enforcement will be brought
to bear to end these attacks.  We have publicly urged her to show
the same zeal in pursuing the perpetrators of these incidents
as she has shown in pursuing her theories of conspiracy among
peaceful protestors outside abortion clinics!

<p>

It's too early to know for certain, but these attacks on churches
are most likely motivated by both religious <b>and</b> racial
bigotry.  Anti-Christian bigotry is the American &quot;exception&quot; 
-- the only acceptable form of intolerance in modern America.  Just 
consider how muffled the response was to the invasion of St. Patrick's
Cathedral in New York by members of the homosexual group Act-Up.
The Montrose Baptist Church, in suburban Washington, DC, has
also been the target of two suspicious fires in recent years.
It is probably no coincidence that the church was heavily involved
on the pro-life side of Maryland's recent abortion referendum.

<p>

Racial prejudice is obviously at work, too.  The damage it wreaks
on America's social fabric is astonishing.  It makes me wonder
if Americans will ever judge one another by the content of our
character, and not the color of our skin.  Can this hatred that
affronts the gospel of Christ continue to divide our house and
drag this nation down?  Our greatest hope is for spiritual revival
to again sweep our land and to bring about healing through reconciliation
within families and between races.  Then and only then will we
know our country is well on the road to recovery.

<p>

The seeds of ethnic hatred should find no fertile soil in this
land we love. That is why I included the following statement
in the Compact with Our Fellow Americans that appears in my new
book, <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

In our work and community life, we promise to elevate a public
ethic of individual merit, regardless of ethnic or national origin, 
or political or religious belief. We will not tolerate the expression, 
public or private, of bigotry on any such basis.  We will judge 
all persons we meet by the content of their character, not the color 
of their skin.

</i>

</blockquote><p>

As this statement suggests, the task of combating religious and
racial hatred is not, first of all, the task of government.  It
is every citizen's task, a battle within the heart that, won there,
cannot be lost in the public square.

<p>

In closing, let me ask that you take up your pen right away and
urge your representatives in Congress to act decisively on these
twin issues.  With a united America behind them, they will be
empowered to act boldly.  In the meantime, let us heed the words
of the apostle Paul and cast off all distress and despair.  Where
we have Christ, we have hope.

<p>

We at FRC feel greatly blessed to be in the heart of our nation's
capital, with the daily chance to address our political leaders
on these vital concerns.  Your friendship and financial support
are part of that blessing, and you have my deepest thanks for
remembering us.  If your circumstances permit, your gift to us
this month will mean so much to our campaign on behalf of family,
faith, and freedom.  Your continued involvement and support are
essential to our success.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. It's always difficult to end a letter like this with a
little house-keeping, but the enclosures this month require some
explanation.  As you know, FRC communicates with you on a regular
basis. You most likely receive both my monthly letter and <I>Washington
Watch,</I> and perhaps other mailings as well. Our goal
is to ensure that every item we send you is useful to your family.
At the same time, we are keenly aware of our responsibility to
exercise stewardship over the resources you entrust to us.  If
you are receiving any mail from FRC that is not meeting your needs,
this is your chance to let us know.  We look forward to continuing
to send you the timeliest pro-family reports available today.

<p>

Please return the enclosed card at your earliest opportunity and note, 
that while we do hope you will respond, <b>no financial gift is 
necessary</b>. Your reply will aid us in serving you -- and many more 
families besides -- to the best of our ability. God bless you.

<title>The Challenge of Revolutionary Iran - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3>THE CHALLENGE OF REVOLUTIONARY IRAN</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/phillips.htm">James Phillips</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<sup>1</sup><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Committee Brief No. 24<br>
March 29, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The recent Middle Eastern travels of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan have sparked considerable controversy. Several Congressmen have called for a government investigation of the trip, including Representative Peter King, who gave a persuasive speech on this subject at The Heritage Foundation on March 6.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Today, I would like to focus on the foreign activities of Iran, which I believe poses the greatest threat to America and to American interests of all the countries that Minister Farrakhan visited. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. and Iran have clashed repeatedly over a wide variety of issues since Iran's 1979 revolution, which brought to power radical Islamic fundamentalists led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Bilateral tensions initially flared due to the November 4, 1979, seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by Iranian militants and the subsequent holding of American hostages for 444 days. Iran-U.S. tensions continue to simmer due to Iran's persistent efforts to export its revolution, Iranian support for international terrorism, Iran's ideological hostility to the U.S., and Iran's military buildup, which includes clandestine efforts to acquire nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons of mass destruction.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran today looms as the chief threat to American interests in the Middle East. The dissolution of the Soviet Union and the military defeat and diplomatic isolation of Iraq, Iran's traditional archrival, has given Iran the opportunity to expand its influence. Although Tehran has toned down its revolutionary rhetoric since the death of Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989, Iran remains a volatile revolutionary state. Tehran continues to denounce the U.S. as "the Global Arrogance," calls for the expulsion of American influence from the Middle East, seeks to discredit and overthrow moderate Arab governments friendly to the U.S., advocates the destruction of Israel, and adamantly opposes the U.S.-sponsored Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran also has increased its financial, political, and military support for radical Islamic fundamentalist movements throughout the Middle East and Southwest Asia. It has developed close ties with Sudan, which it uses as a training ground for Islamic militants from throughout the region. In the short run, Iran poses more of an ideological, subversive, and terrorist threat than a military threat to America and its Middle Eastern allies. In the long run, however, Iran's military buildup, particularly its development programs for nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile weaponry, will pose an increasingly grave challenge to the security of American forces and U.S. allies in the region.
<p>
<b>IRAN'S HOSTILE FOREIGN POLICY</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since the 1979 Iranian revolution, Tehran has seen itself as the leader of the Muslim world. It has sought to export its revolutionary brand of Islam and to radicalize Muslims everywhere. The U.S., which Khomeini referred to as the "Great Satan," is hated for its support of the Iranian regime of Shah Reza Pahlavi; for its support of Israel, which Iranian radicals seek to destroy; and for its support of moderate Arab regimes such as those in Egypt and Saudi Arabia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But regardless of its policies, the U.S. is hated for its values and the powerful influence of its culture, which Iranian revolutionaries believe seduces Muslims and undermines Islam. This ideological motivation explains why Iranian-supported terrorists in Lebanon in the 1980s attacked targets affiliated with the American University of Beirut and Christian churches, in addition to the U.S. Marines serving in the multinational peacekeeping force.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since 1979, Iran has been more of an ideological, subversive, and terrorist threat to its neighbors than a military threat. Tehran has enjoyed only limited success in fomenting revolution, in part because Iran's Shiite brand of Islam is shared by only about 15 percent of all Muslims. The Sunni (orthodox) Muslims who make up more than 80 percent of the Islamic world tend to be more respectful of state authority and distrustful of Shiite radicals. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran's greatest success has come in war-torn Lebanon, where it helped to create, finance, arm, and train the radical Shiite Hezbollah (Party of God) movement. Several hundred Iranian Revolutionary Guards, the militant shock troops of the Iranian revolution, work closely in support of Hezbollah in Lebanon's Bekaa valley. Tehran also supports less powerful Shiite fundamentalist groups in Iraq, Bahrain, and Afghanistan. But Shiite revolutionaries have seized power nowhere outside Iran. In fact, Shiite rebellions have been crushed in Iraq (1991) and Saudi Arabia (1979), and an Iranian-backed coup attempt was quashed in Bahrain in 1981.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iranian-supported Islamic revolutions, however, now have better prospects for success. The dissolution of the Soviet Union not only has opened up Central Asia to Iranian influence, but also has deprived secular Arab nationalist regimes in Algeria, Iraq, Libya, and Syria of a source of political, military, and economic support. The failure of Arab socialism in such countries as Algeria and Egypt has left them with feeble economies unable to absorb the huge number of youths who are entering the labor market. Faced with a bleak economic future, young Arabs are turning to radical fundamentalist movements to find hope and meaning in their lives. Some Arab fundamentalists, radicalized by the Islamic holy war (jihad) against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, have returned home to spearhead anti-government violence in their own countries. Iranian-supported Muslim fundamentalists are well-positioned to exploit the collapse of Soviet communism and Arab socialism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran has established good working relations with several Sunni fundamentalist groups since 1990, including Hamas (the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement); Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine; the Islamic Group of Egypt; and similar groups in Algeria, Jordan, and Tunisia. The opening of Arab-Israeli peace talks at the Madrid Conference in October 1991 gave Iran and Palestinian fundamentalists a common interest in disrupting the U.S.-sponsored negotiations by escalating terrorist attacks against Israel. Iran invited a Hamas delegation to attend an October 1992 international conference held in Tehran to coordinate opposition to the peace process. Tehran subsequently agreed to help train Hamas terrorists, give Hamas $30 million over two years, and permit Hamas to open an "embassy" in Tehran. Israeli intelligence officials estimate that Iran now provides 10 to 20 percent of the roughly $70 million in donations that Hamas receives annually from its supporters around the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Tehran has welcomed the terrorist offensive which Hamas launched against Israel in the last month, killing 62 people in four suicide bombings. The state-run Iranian news service called the bombings "God's retribution."  Despite the worldwide revulsion triggered by the bombings, Iran remains one of Hamas' foremost foreign backers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran's efforts to reach out to Sunni fundamentalists have been facilitated by Iran's closest ally, Sudan, which is ruled by the only radical fundamentalist regime in the Arab world. Arab officials maintain that Sudan has helped Iran establish ties with Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Jordan, the Renaissance fundamentalist movement in Tunisia, and the Armed Islamic Group in Algeria.
<p>
<b>IRAN'S LINKS TO SUDAN</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran has become the chief supporter and ally of Sudan's National Islamic Front, a Sunni fundamentalist movement that came to power following Lt. General Omar Hassan Bashir's 1989 coup. Sudan, Africa's largest state, offers Iran a strategic foothold to outflank Saudi Arabia and extend its revolutionary influence throughout North Africa and the Horn of Africa. Iranian-Sudanese cooperation escalated following President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's December 1991 visit to Sudan. Hundreds of Iranian military advisers and Revolutionary Guards were dispatched to Sudan to help train the Sudanese Army and internal security forces. Iranians also are believed to be assisting Sudan's radical regime in its long-running war against Christian and animist rebels in southern Sudan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although Iran claims that most of these personnel in Sudan are engaged in construction projects, persistent reports indicate that the Revolutionary Guards are training Islamic fundamentalist revolutionaries and terrorists, primarily from Algeria, Egypt, and Tunisia. U.S. officials maintain that Iranians train terrorists in five camps around Khartoum that are equipped and financed by Iran. The Egyptian government contends that several thousand Egyptian fundamentalists have received training from Iranians in Sudanese camps. Egyptian intelligence officials claim to have evidence that Iran was responsible for training and organizing terrorists who have attacked foreign tourists in Egypt. Algeria expelled Iranian diplomats in November 1992 and broke diplomatic relations with Iran in March 1993 after accusing Tehran of supporting Islamic radicals who have waged a bloody guerrilla war against Algeria's military regime that has resulted in the deaths of over 30,000 Algerians since 1991.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Sudan has become in effect a "new Lebanon" where Iranian revolutionaries arm, train, and equip Arab fundamentalists for political violence while denying responsibility for their actions. Significantly, Iran's former ambassador to Sudan, Majid Kamal, helped create Hezbollah when he was the Iranian charg d'affaires in Beirut in the early 1980s. But unlike Lebanon, where Iran's freedom of action is constrained by Syria's military domination, the fundamentalist Sudanese government fully shares Iran's revolutionary goals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Sudan also is a valuable ally for Iran because of its key role in helping Iran to expand its contacts with Sunni fundamentalists, especially Egyptian and Palestinian groups opposed to peace negotiations with Israel. Iranian-supported Egyptian fundamentalists easily can infiltrate the porous Sudanese-Egyptian border, seeking to overthrow the Egyptian government. The Islamic Group, which considers Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman to be its spiritual leader, has launched terrorist attacks that have killed hundreds of Egyptians since early 1992.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Egypt is one of Iran's most important targets for subversion because of its historic role as the preeminent Arab power. An Islamic revolution in Egypt would send shock waves throughout the Arab world and incite Islamic revolution elsewhere. Moreover, a radical fundamentalist Egypt would break its peace treaty with Israel and render moot the U.S.-backed Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which Iran has denounced as "treason."  As the leading Muslim power unequivocally opposed to Israel's existence, Iran stands to gain much from prolonging the Arab-Israeli conflict.
<p>
<b>IRAN'S SUPPORT OF TERRORISM</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran is the world's "most active state sponsor of international terrorism and continues to be directly involved in planning and executing terrorist acts," according to the State Department's most recent report on terrorism, <I>Patterns of Global Terrorism, 1994</i>, which was published in April 1995. Iranian intelligence agencies support terrorism, either directly or through extremist groups, primarily aimed against Iranian opposition movements, Israel, or moderate Arab regimes. Tehran has established over 20 ideological and military training camps in Iran, Lebanon, and Sudan staffed by Arabic-speaking Revolutionary Guards.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hezbollah, Iran's most important surrogate, has become the "world's principal international terrorist organization," according to former CIA Director James Woolsey, testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on July 28, 1993. The Lebanon-based organization has established groups of supporters as far away as Australia, Canada, India, Indonesia, and South America. Hezbollah's long list of terrorist atrocities includes the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks at Beirut Airport, and the kidnapping of most of the 15 American hostages held in Lebanon between 1984 and 1991.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The last American hostages held in Lebanon were released by Hezbollah at Iran's direction in late 1991 after Tehran concluded that it could gain nothing from holding the hostages any longer. Iran's use of terrorism as an instrument of policy remains undiminished, however. In recent years, Tehran has stepped up its terrorist attacks against Iranian exile leaders and Israel. More than a dozen Iranian dissidents have been assassinated in European cities since 1987, including the August 1991 murder of former Iranian Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar in Paris and the September 1992 murders of four Kurdish opposition leaders in Berlin. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Iran's terrorist campaign against exiled opposition activists appears to be growing in intensity in recent months. On February 20, 1996, two Iranian exiles were assassinated in Turkey. On March 2, two Sunni Iranian clerics were assassinated in Pakistan. And on March 7, another Iranian opposition activist was assassinated in Baghdad, the sixth killed inside Iraq since May 1995.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Iran's assassins also have struck inside the United States. Iranian political activist Ali A. Tabatabai, the founder of the Iran Freedom Foundation, was murdered at his home in Bethesda, Maryland, on July 22, 1980.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Although Iranians recently have not been caught launching terrorist attacks on American targets, Iran furnishes substantial financial, logistical, and training support to terrorist groups that continue to target Americans. Tehran provided financial support, at a minimum, for some of the Islamic militants arrested for the February 1993 bombing that killed six people at the World Trade Center in New York. Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman, the radical Egyptian cleric who inspired and guided the bombers, long has been funded by Iran's intelligence service, according to Vincent Cannistraro, former head of CIA counterterrorism operations. Sheik Omar reportedly was regularly given large sums of money by Iran's delegation to the United Nations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although no direct Iranian participation has been established in the World Trade Center bombing, senior U.S. officials warned in March 1993 that Iranian-backed terrorist groups appeared to be becoming more aggressive. Iran also reportedly has begun cooperating with non-fundamentalist terrorist groups such as the Abu Nidal Organization, a renegade Palestinian terrorist group that has launched some of the bloodiest and most indiscriminate terrorist attacks, such as the December 1985 massacres at the Rome and Vienna airports. Iran also financially supports the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC), a pro-Syrian group which it reportedly asked in 1988 to bomb a U.S. airliner in retaliation for the July 1988 accidental downing of an Iranian airliner by the <I>U.S.S. Vincennes</I>. The plot was disrupted by the arrest of a terrorist cell in Germany in October 1988. Libyan agents reportedly then bombed Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iranian-supported terrorists have been particularly active against targets in Turkey. The Turkish Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility in 1992 for the murder of an Israeli diplomat and the bombing of an Istanbul synagogue. It also is believed to be responsible for a series of murders of Turkish journalists. Iran also supports the Marxist Kurdish Workers' Party, which has waged a long-running terrorist war against the government in eastern Turkey. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

But in recent years it has been Israel that has been the prime foreign target of Iran's terror campaign. Iran was involved in the March 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, which killed 29 people. In March 1994, three Iranian agents were arrested in Thailand after an abortive attempt to detonate a truck bomb at the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok. Iranian involvement is also suspected in the July 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires that killed 96 people. Iran continues to support Hezbollah's terrorist offensive against Israeli forces along the Lebanese-Israeli border, as well as the terrorist operations of Hamas inside Israel. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

 Under Iranian tutelage, Sudan has emerged as a leading sponsor of international terrorism. Sudan has given sanctuary to a wide spectrum of terrorist groups, including many Arab militants who participated in the fundamentalist jihad in Afghanistan. Sudan gave Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman sanctuary before he moved to New York. Two Sudanese diplomats were implicated in the aborted plot by eight of the Sheik's followers to bomb the United Nations headquarters in New York. Moreover, five of the eight suspected terrorists arrested for the plot in June 1993 were Sudanese. Sudan's escalating involvement in international terrorism led Washington in August 1993 to add Sudan to the State Department's list of states that sponsor terrorism, which also has included Iran since 1984. This prohibits the transfer of U.S. military equipment, militarily useful civilian technology, and foreign aid to the terrorist state, strips it of favorable trade privileges, and requires the U.S. to block loans by international financial institutions.
<p>
<b>IRAN'S MILITARY BUILDUP</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran currently poses only a limited conventional military threat to its neighbors. Since the 1979 revolution, its armed forces have been weakened by political purges, huge losses of up to 60 percent of their major weapons systems in the eight-year war with Iraq, and shortages of spare parts for U.S. and Western arms supplied before 1979. But President Rafsanjani has accorded a high priority to building Iran's military strength. Shortly after coming to power in July 1989, Rafsanjani traveled to Moscow to sign a $1.9 billion arms deal that included 48 modern MiG-29 <I>Fulcrum</I> fighters and 100 T-72 tanks. His government, in January 1990, allocated $2 billion per year for five years to buy advanced arms. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran's ambitious military plans have sparked considerable concern that Tehran seeks to establish regional hegemony by building its military capabilities far beyond its legitimate defense needs. Iran's long-term objective reportedly is to acquire a modern air force of roughly 300 advanced combat aircraft; a modern army with 5,000 to 6,000 tanks, 2,000 self-propelled artillery pieces, and thousands of armored personnel carriers; and a navy upgraded with three advanced Russian <I>Kilo</I>-class submarines and scores of fast patrol boats armed with missiles.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran also has purchased hundreds of ballistic missiles and the technology to produce them from North Korea and China. Tehran has acquired at least 300 SCUD-B surface-to-surface missiles with a range of approximately 185 miles, and an unknown number of improved SCUD-Cs, which have a range of approximately 370 miles. These missiles enable Iran to attack states across the Persian Gulf. Iran also reportedly has agreed to buy 150 North Korean Nodong 1 missiles with an estimated range of over 600 miles. These surface-to-surface missiles are capable of delivering conventional, chemical, or nuclear warheads on targets as far away as Israel.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran's missile buildup is especially worrisome given Tehran's determined efforts to build weapons of mass destruction. Iran has "the most active chemical warfare program" in the Third World, according to an anonymous U.S. government official quoted in the <I>Washington Post</I> on March 8, 1996. The CIA estimates that Iran has produced and stockpiled up to 2,000 tons of chemical warfare agents, which it used at least once during the Iran-Iraq war. Iran also has an active biological warfare program and is trying to buy biological agents from Europe that could be useful in developing such weapons, according to U.S. intelligence sources. Some U.S. experts believe that Iran already may have produced biological weapons in the form of toxins or anthrax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But the West's chief worry is Iran's effort to develop nuclear weapons, which has been making steady progress under the cover of Iran's civilian nuclear power program. CIA Director John Deutch stated in November 1995 that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in as little as four years if it received extensive foreign assistance. American intelligence analysts have reported that Iranian acquisition teams have shopped for weapons-related nuclear equipment and nuclear scientists in the former Soviet Union, concentrating on Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In conclusion, although Iran now poses primarily an ideological, subversive, and terrorist threat to American interests in the Middle East and the Muslim world, in the long run Iran will pose an increasingly grave military threat to the security of the U.S., American military forces in the Middle East, and American allies in the region.

<h3> What Are America's Vital Interests?</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin J. Feulner</a>, Ph.D.
<P>
Delivered February 6, 1996
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Tonight I would like to outline a conservative internationalist foreign policy anchored in the foundation of vital American interests. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I define those vital interests as developments that could concretely affect the security or economic future of America and our citizens. Before giving you my list of American vital interests, let me first touch upon the growing drift in U.S. foreign policy since the end of the Cold War. In other words, let's review current policy.
<p>

<table border=0 align=left>

</table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Clinton's foreign policy has been formulated by a group of retreads from the Carter Administration who were uncomfortable, unconvinced, and therefore unsuccessful in waging the Cold War against the Soviet Union. They returned to office with Clinton and believed that they could successfully reorient American foreign policy to harness the American military for what they deemed to be virtuous crusades in far-flung regions of the world. But they neglected the fact that the American people supported distant interventions during the Cold War only on behalf of important American national interests, and specifically to oppose the spread of an expansionist, ideological, totalitarian system that was publicly committed to burying us.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
American foreign policy has drifted dangerously astray, especially since 1993. A large part of the problem is that the Clinton Administration appears to be incapable of distinguishing between America's vital interests and some liberal do-gooders' marginal interests. The Administration too often has resorted to questionable military interventions to promote its peculiar vision of American values in such countries as Bosnia, Haiti, and Somalia, where there were no vital American interests at stake.
<p>
<b>The New World Order </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Remember the New World Order that some American foreign policy gurus were hoping to achieve?  The rest of us ordinary folks soon learned that it was long on new and short on order. Some of us have called this the age of chaos.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I can almost point to the very moment when American foreign policy began losing its purpose. It was that defining day in Moscow -- the day when the line at McDonald's became longer than the line at Lenin's tomb. That really happened, and when it did the communism versus capitalism argument was over. The tenor of the discussion in Russia went from "We will bury you" to "Do you want fries with that?"  But with it, too, went America's organizing purpose abroad. Our prior purpose had been containment of the Soviet Union and eventually, for us conservatives, liberation of the captive nations.
<P>
<b>Isolationist Right and Interventionist Left</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the United States has been searching for an intellectual framework for its foreign policy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A band of conservative isolationists on the fringe wants America to withdraw from the world altogether, while a suddenly macho band of liberal interventionists seeks to remake Haiti, Rwanda, Somalia, and the rest of the world in its own preening self-image.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The isolationist right thinks that we have few vital interests and so we shouldn't join alliances, which only entangle us. The interventionist left distrusts America's power and our vital interests and seeks to deny them by putting our troops and interests under the authority of the United Nations. Both approaches reflect a defeatist attitude of an America in decline -- a pessimistic attitude that America cannot hold its own in the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The fringe isolationist right hides behind protectionism, having no confidence that the U.S. can compete in the international world economy. The interventionist left hides behind multilateralism, having no confidence that the U.S. can compete in values and in the integrity of its interests. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The real problem, it seems to me, is that neither group has any conception of America's true vital interests in the real world today.
<p>
<b>Clinton's Foreign Policy</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration's foreign policy reminds me of the man who said he wanted to take assertiveness training but that his wife wouldn't let him. It variously and alternately seeks to promote human rights, alleviate human suffering, recreate history by undoing coups, build Western-style nations in places that have no Western values, stop nuclear proliferation with vague unverifiable agreements, and advance democracy and international law while raising the planet's environmental conscience.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When not engaged in these activities, the U.S. State Department, under mandates from earlier liberal Congresses issues reports on America's own human rights abuses and bemoans what it calls the historical and continuing oppression of African Americans, Native Americans, and Women Americans. Meanwhile, the U.S. foreign aid bill mandates that U.S. government agencies promote "harmony among diverse racial, religious, and ethnic groups" in foreign countries -- something we can't accomplish or even define at home. Elsewhere in our foreign aid program, it's mandated that we must "include the economic empowerment of women as a factor in the evaluation of projects and programs."  We're even supposed to stop discrimination by foreign governments against people with disabilities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Currently, the ultimate foreign policy test is not the vital interests of the American people, but mushy compassion. I commend to you a scathing article in the current issue of the journal <I>Foreign Affairs</I> entitled "Foreign Policy as Social Work," which rakes the Clinton Administration over the coals for its feel-good foreign policy. Written by Michael Mandelbaum, a foreign policy scholar who is no conservative and initially supported the Clinton Administration, the article lambastes the Administration for a misconceived foreign policy that is aimed at relieving suffering in conflict-ridden regions of the world rather than promoting American national interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Clinton presided over three failed military interventions in his first year in office which then set the tone and much of the agenda for this Administration's foreign policy. 
These were:
<P><ul>
<li> The announced intention and subsequent failure to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia and bomb the Bosnian Serbs in May 1993;
<p>
<li> The deaths of 18 U.S. Army Rangers in a failed Special Forces operation in Somalia in early October 1993; and
<p>
<li> The dispatch of a U.S. Navy ship carrying military trainers and its subsequent recall due to anti-American demonstrations in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in mid-October 1993.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under Clinton, American foreign policy has been transformed into an international social welfare program. Clinton has expended billions of dollars and scores of American lives in these naive military interventions in Somalia, Bosnia, and Haiti -- three countries where the U.S. has no vital interests at stake.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In Somalia, the Clinton Administration inherited a humanitarian intervention designed to feed starving Somalians. But while President Bush sent American troops to Somalia to feed people, President Clinton clumsily escalated the mission into a doomed scenario called "nation-building."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In Bosnia, Clinton has zigged and zagged so many times, nobody is sure what U.S. policy actually is. But the same mission creep that led to disaster in Somalia is built into the ambiguous U.S. intervention in Bosnia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In Haiti, Clinton has chosen to commit the U.S. to bring stability and democracy by working with an unstable leader, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in a country that has never had a stable democracy. Slowly, it is dawning even on the President that the only way to sustain Aristide in office is to extend the stay of U.S. troops in Haiti. Our troops have become Aristide's palace guard. The intervention has already cost an estimated $1.9 billion. This is the equivalent of almost $300 for each of Haiti's 6.5 million people.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Administration is a hawk on Haiti, Somalia, and Bosnia -- in other words, causes that require only small-scale military actions, enjoy the cover of U.N. approval, and serve no clear-cut strategic interest of the United States. And yet it is a dove when it comes to standing up to North Korea, Iran, or some other hostile power that genuinely does threaten U.S. vital interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;That is not all.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration's feel-good foreign policy focuses on peripheral international issues, often to curry favor with special-interest domestic political constituencies. For example, the Administration actively has intervened in Haiti to court African-Americans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
These politically motivated actions are not only an unnecessary waste. They also come at the expense of important American foreign policy interests and defense needs. Humanitarian interventions and nation-building experiments have diverted attention from key items on the American foreign policy agenda.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These key items include:
<p><ul>
<li> Bilateral relations with Russia, whose recent elections have underscored a growing anti-Western backlash;
<p>
<li> China, which is becoming increasingly aggressive and belligerent in East Asia;
<p>
<li> Iran, whose clandestine nuclear efforts and continued export of terrorism have led Congress to seize the initiative and force the Administration to impose trade sanctions;
<p>
<li> NATO, whose future now has become entangled with the future of Bosnia, a military quagmire of uncertain resolution;
<p>
<li> Missile defense, a critical element of national defense that the Administration has woefully neglected; and
<P>
<li> The promotion of free trade, which the Administration allowed to fall by the wayside when it failed to gain fast-track negotiating authority for expanding NAFTA to include Chile.
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, the expanding commitment of U.S. military forces to far-flung humanitarian and peacekeeping operations has stretched thin our military forces around the globe. These commitments have also undermined our ability to respond to dangerous threats to our vital interests elsewhere. A recent article in the <I>Washington Times</I> reported that Pentagon officials are concerned that the commitment of 30,000 American troops to Bosnia and the surrounding region will seriously undermine our ability to repel aggression in the Persian Gulf or on the Korean peninsula -- you see, in military and foreign policy, everything is connected to everything else. Thus, the diversion of U.S. combat troops to peacekeeping operations depletes our strategic reserves. It erodes military readiness by interfering with training to sharpen warfighting skills.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the concerns of the Pentagon, the Administration is now considering an additional peacekeeping operation -- the deployment of U.S. troops to the Golan Heights if a peace treaty is signed by Israel and Syria. Such a deployment is dangerous. It will be either too small to defend itself if another Middle East war erupts or too big, further straining our ability to meet other military contingencies around the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition, it will be an inviting target for a group of terrorists -- or an official party to the treaty (I refer to Syria and not, of course, to Israel). I say inviting target because the U.S. troops would be an especially attractive "trip wire" to bring the U.S. into the conflict or to drive the U.S. home, out of our more appropriate role in the Middle East.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In summary, ladies and gentlemen, America now has a foreign policy as chaotic as the world itself. I do not believe such a policy can possibly offer the leadership that is needed to protect American interests. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We have a policy of good intentions, as defined by a bunch of mushy-minded liberals. But in foreign policy, good intentions are not enough. We all know that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. As Mandelbaum noted in his article, "While Mother Teresa is an admirable person and social work a noble profession, conducting American foreign policy by her example is an expensive proposition."  And, I might add, an ineffective and inefficient one at that.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So what is to be done?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
My friends, first of all, the left-liberals in America need to get over this notion that it's somehow embarrassing or even immoral to have vital global interests. The isolationists need to get over the idea that, with Soviet communism gone, we no longer have global interests. The fact is, the United States is a global power. Responsibility as a global power requires us to behave like a global power. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We can protect neither our interests nor our values unless we remain a global power. As we approach the 21st century, we must apply the lessons we learned in the 20th century: It is too dangerous for us to hide and to put our heads in the sand.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I believe the world longs for America's leadership, the kind of leadership that led Ronald Reagan to stand there in Berlin in 1987 and demand, "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!"  Each day we find out more and more from Soviet archives how it was U.S. strength that freed the people of the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I believe the world is a freer, safer, more stable place when the U.S. is actively pursuing its own vital national interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Leadership that we have because we are the world's only remaining superpower -- 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Militarily:</b> America's blue water Navy helps safeguard access to free trade and natural resources not just for the U.S., but for all nations. The guarantee of U.S. military support for the NATO alliance is critical to Europe remaining a free and prosperous community of nations. But that does not mean the U.S. should get involved in a local conflicts like the one in Bosnia. Resolving that thorny crisis is a European interest, not an American interest
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Economically:</b> Not only is the U.S. economy the world's largest, but Americans lead the world economy as both importers and exporters.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Educationally:</b> I don't need to tell you how many students from around the world come to America to study. When these students return home, they take with them experiences that bolster free ideas and free markets in their countries -- and that benefits us all.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Technologically:</b> America leads the world in inventions and innovations of all kinds, and the whole world benefits. Look at the personal computer, soon to be as common and affordable as the television set. This tool empowers people everywhere to tap into the enormous wealth of information on the Internet and to share ideas unimpeded by national boundaries.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Entrepreneurially:</b> America's corporations know better than anyone how important it is to remain flexible in a global economy. Hence they are constantly innovating, finding ways to do more, to do it better, and to do it with fewer resources. When the world's largest economy does these things, it is felt around the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Culturally:</b> You can travel anywhere in the world and see vivid signs of American culture like popular music and movie stars. Less vivid but more enduring, however, are the ideas of democracy and free markets that the United States has been sharing with the other nations of the world for over two centuries, helping to make the world safer and more prosperous for everyone.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I believe that when America's vital interests are served, so are the values of political and economic freedom worldwide, because to the extent that America is a strong leader protecting its values, those same democratic values are safer and more vital elsewhere in the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Here, briefly, are what I believe America's interests to be.
<p>
<b>VITAL INTEREST #1: Safeguard U.S. national security.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This means, above all, to protect America's territory, borders, and airspace.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Our borders are not threatened by the likes of Haitian boat people -- a situation created by our own economic embargo of that poor, desperate country. No, the biggest threat to the United States remains long-range missiles armed with nuclear weapons. Our response to this threat should include an anti-missile defense and a broad nonproliferation policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration vetoed Congress's defense bill recently, largely because it contained an aggressive program for building missile defenses for America by the year 2003. Yet Secretary of Defense William Perry just last month finalized plans for building a missile defense system for Israel in five years, using existing technology. To quote Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, "it will be a great contribution to the security" of the Middle East. But I believe it is inconsistent -- no, it is mad for the United States to help allies to defend themselves against missile attacks while denying our own citizens that same capability.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A broad nonproliferation policy also should be a vital component of American foreign policy. If diplomacy fails to discourage hostile powers from acquiring nuclear weapons, our vital interest could warrant the use of force -- unilaterally if necessary -- to stop renegade nations from becoming nuclear powers. I believe the civilized world would sigh with relief if we decided to eliminate those facilities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This also means maintenance of the necessary conventional forces to protect our homeland.
<p>
<b>VITAL INTEREST #2: Prevent a major power threat to Europe, East Asia, or the Persian Gulf.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Here threats include expansionist activities by Russia against her neighbors, an expansionist Iraq or Iran, or a nuclear-armed North Korea. And we should not focus simply on immediate threats. Today radical nationalism, Islamic fundamentalism, and -- although not as threatening as its original version -- neocommunism exist in places where the U.S. has vital interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Regarding Europe, it is a false economy to withdraw any more of our 100,000 troops just because Russia is not an immediate danger. To those who say, "Well, we'll just come back if or when Russia is a threat again," I say, "You mean like we did in 1944 on the beaches of Normandy?"  And to those who ask, "Why should America pay anything to defend Europe or East Asia?"  I say, "We're not paying for Europe's defense or Japan's defense. We're paying for <I>our</I> defense."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Far better to keep 100,000 troops in Europe to maintain the peace than to send a million later to fight a war started in our absence. Far better to enter into strategic alliances -- like NATO and our mutual defense treaties with Japan and South Korea -- than to try to go it alone.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A word about China: The rulers in Beijing must learn that it is in the national interest of the U.S. to stay a permanent Pacific power. This means that we will not tolerate any forcible activity from mainland China against Taiwan. Taiwan is much more than our 7th-largest trading partner. She has also become the model for a vigorous, democratic, free-market society in Asia. We will not tolerate an invasion, blockade, or aggressive activity by mainland China against Taiwan.
<p>
<b>VITAL INTEREST #3: Maintain access to foreign trade.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The greatest danger here comes not from outside U.S. borders but from inside, from those who fear America cannot compete. The protectionists who opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement and GATT are pessimists about America's future. They favor the low-paying textile jobs of the past over the higher paying technology jobs of tomorrow. They are blind to the regenerative power of the free market, which they believe in devoutly for the domestic economy but not for the world economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
GATT was central to the Reagan and Bush agendas because those administrations recognized that the U.S. is the world's largest exporter, not just the world's largest economy. Yet some Republicans seem to forget this, and some of them even have edged toward playing politics with free trade. I hope those Republicans return to the party's long tradition of seeking open markets for the benefit of both U.S. consumers and U.S. exporters.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage Foundation supported the Clinton Administration on the North American Free Trade Agreement, and we supported it on GATT. We will continue to support further efforts toward expanded free trade, such as expanding NAFTA to include Chile as the next step.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I have confidence that our great nation, with our great people, can compete economically with any country. I am distressed by those who don't have this confidence in America, that we can compete and win.
<P>
<b>VITAL INTEREST #4: Protect Americans against threats to their lives and well-being.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. has an obligation whenever possible to protect American citizens from terrorist activity and other international criminal activity. Yet, if a recent incident is any indication, I don't think the U.S. State Department quite understands this elementary concept.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Terry Anderson, who was held hostage for seven years by Lebanese terrorists, wrote a book on his captivity entitled <I>Den of Lions</I>. While he was writing it, the U.S. State Department refused to turn over any documents it had on his captors for two years because -- get this -- it felt compelled to protect their privacy!  The State Department said it could not give Anderson the documents unless he received written permission from the terrorists for the information's release.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Is it any wonder the State Department seems to have a problem sorting out America's vital interests?  As the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, wrote to Secretary of State Christopher on the day after our seismic November 1994 elections, "It's about time there was an American Desk at the Department of State."
<p>
<b>VITAL INTEREST #5: Maintain access to resources.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The American economy depends on foreign oil, which now accounts for more than 50 percent of America's oil consumption and is expected to provide an increasing share of future oil consumption. A threat to our oil supply is a threat to our national interest. Tour the oil fields of Kuwait, as I did three months ago, and you will see first-hand why we must maintain our access to vital natural resources.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Reduced to their basics, then these are America's five vital interests.
<P>

<b>Assertive Multilateralism: A Liberal Oxymoron</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Liberals, of course, often believe that where the U.S. has real interests is exactly where we should tread the lightest because these interests are somehow unseemly. As a result, America's foreign policy recently has pursued what is called "assertive multilateralism" -- a contradiction in terms if I've ever heard one.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Let me add that using force multinationally is no more moral than wielding it unilaterally. The U.N. is filled with governments and dictatorships that do not represent the wills of their people. Why is the U.N. more moral than the U.S. Congress?  Yet President Clinton sought and received U.N. approval for invading Haiti but skipped the U.S. Congress. I believe multilateralism is the abandonment of America's leadership role in the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now, beyond these vital interests I've just mentioned, America has a number of other important interests, as well as many marginal ones, constantly tugging at us. The U.S. has an important interest in promoting democracy and free markets abroad, especially in regions where old totalitarian or authoritarian empires have collapsed. The more democratic the world becomes, the more peaceful it becomes, and therefore the more congenial for U.S. values and interests. Public diplomacy -- that is, reaching out above governments to tell America's story to the world -- is an important tool for promoting American interests and values.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The problem, however, is that the marginal interests -- not the vital ones -- have been driving our foreign policy. This has undermined U.S. credibility abroad and casts doubt on the steadfastness of American foreign policy in many places. This situation will not endure. I'm reminded of what Winston Churchill said during World War II: "You can always count on the Americans to do the right thing, but only after they exhaust all other opportunities."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So, in closing, I believe the United States eventually will do the right thing and recognize our own vital interests. We need not deny these interests. The world need not fear them. They are a stabilizing force for peace and prosperity. That we believe in democracy, freedom, and the power of open markets is something of which we should be proud, not ashamed. We should reassert this in a positive and forthright way. Maintaining the strength and the coherent international principles to protect those values is not a luxury. Rather, it is an obligation of the federal government written into our Constitution. It is the most basic obligation of all: "to provide for the common defense... and secure the blessings of liberty."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The poet Carl Sandburg wrote of American destiny that "Always there arose enough reserves of strength, balances of sanity, portions of wisdom to carry the nation through to a fresh start with ever renewing vitality."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I believe America's vitality and leadership abroad will return, but I think it will take a change of administration to accomplish this. It is a challenge and an opportunity that we, as a great nation, cannot afford to let pass.

<title> Tax Limitation Amendment</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<h2><i>Tax Limitation</i></h2> <br>		             
</center>

Although April 15th is always an important day in the Unites States, this year, this day will earmark a hopeful turn of events.  The Tax Limitation Amendment, one of the first reform acts of the 104th Congress, will go to the House floor on April 15th.  Sponsored by over 166 Representatives, this amendment would require Congress to have a two-thirds majority vote in each house to approve tax-rate increases. <p> 

Senator Kyl (R-AZ) is the driving force behind the amendment for the Senate.  Senator Kyl has proposed that if this bill passes it would need ratification by 38 states in order to become the 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution. <p>

One of the key factors to passing this bill would not only make it harder for Congress to raise taxes, but would force lawmakers to prioritize government spending.  The bill was written to encourage the elimination of lower priority programs to pay for new proposals as opposed to seeking finances through raised taxes. <p>

Recent surveys and studies have shown that the majority of American voters support the Tax Limitation Amendment.  The bill has also received tremendous backing from many high profile organizations, such as the American Conservative Union, the Christian Coalition, Citizens Against Government Waste, Family Research Council, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. <p>

Below is a layout of the proposed bill and some of the key reasons why it would stabilize tax laws: <p>

 <p> <br> <br> <br> 
					
					<center>April 15 Floor Vote </center> <p>

Section 1.<p>
	Any bill to increase taxes by increasing the rate or base of any tax may pass only by a two-thirds majority of the whole number of each House of Congress. <p>

Section 2.<p>
	Waiver during periods of declared war or imminent and serious threat to national security declared by a joint resolution.  Any provision which passed subject to the waiver shall last no more than 2 years. <p>

Section 3.<p>
	All votes will be roll call votes. <p>

<p> <br>  <br> 

				 <center>	Talking Points </center> <p>
<ul>
<li>The Kemp Commission on Tax Reform endorsed a 2/3rds super-majority requirement for tax increases. It is an essential part of any tax reform.<p>

<li> One-third of all Americans live in a state with tax limitation in their constitutions: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and South Dakota.  Other states are pursuing similar measures. <p>

<li> In the last decade, taxes in non-super-majority states went up 104%.  In super-majority requirement states, tax revenues went up only 87%. <p>

<li> In the last decade, spending in non-super-majority states went up 102%.  In states with the super-majority protection, spending increased only 95%. <p>

<li> It must be more difficult for future Congresses to raise taxes. Because federal benefits tend to be targeted at specific groups, special interest groups consistently come together to effectively lobby for more spending.  Taxes, on the other hand are spread among many millions of people who would find it difficult to band together as an interest group. The built-in pressure in a democracy is toward more spending.  The super-majority provision successfully balances the pressure. <p>

<li> Four of the last five major tax increases were passed with less than a two-thirds super-majority.  Those taxes added an additional $666 billion to the tax bill for the American taxpayer. <p>

<li> On Day One of the 104th Congress, the House voted 279-152 for a super-majority requirement to raise income taxes -- 11 votes shy of two-thirds.  This important protection, though, only applies during the 104th Congress, and only to the House. <p>

<i>March 28, 1996</i>
<h2>Hearings on the<br> Federal Communications Commission</h2>
<b>Before the House of Representatives Subcommittee on<br>
Telecommunications and Finance of the Commerce Committee<br></b><P>
Testimony of <a href="/pff/people/afellow.html#Pitsch">Peter K. Pitsch</a>
<P><br>

<B>Summary of Testimony</B>
<P>
 Important as the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is, important systemic
telecommunications reforms are still needed.  Although some federal and state
regulation remains appropriate, experience has now shown that industries
governed by market forces generally work better than government-run or
regulated ones:<p>
<ul>
<li>    Markets produce objective information on how consumers and producers value
resources and strong incentives to act on this information.  The FCC's delay
of cellular is estimated to have cost America over $80 billion.<p>
<li>    Competitors often use the regulatory process  to delay innovation and
competition by several years or even decades.  Consider customer premises
equipment, long distance yesterday and today, cable, video dial tone, VHF
drop-ins, low power TV, and DBS.<p>
<li>    The pace of technical change, especially regarding digital technologies,
has increased the cost of regulation.  Digital technologies make most
regulatory distinctions between voice and data and video just plain silly.
In accordance with these principles, much of the FCC's current responsibility
should be devolved to the states, transferred to the Department of Justice
and most important of all committed to the marketplace, in the end the true
agency of consumer protection.<p>  
</ul>
First, most federal price and profit regulation of telecom markets should be
eliminated, either because the relevant markets are effectively competitive,
regulation is better left to the states, or such federal regulation is
counterproductive.  Possible forbearance targets recommended by some members
of  the Progress & Freedom Foundation Working Group are attached to my
testimony.  They include tariffing, service bundling, and self-certification
reforms.<p>
Second, the electromagnetic spectrum should be largely privatized. Existing
spectrum licensees should be given freedom to use their spectrum as they see
fit as long as they do not interfere with other licensees--their cochannel
and adjacent channel neighbors.  Unallocated private and underutilized
federal spectrum should be made available in flexible assignments through
auctions.  A detailed proposal for reforming the electromagnetic spectrum
developed by members of the PFF Working Group is attached to my testimony.
Third, much of the FCC's general public interest authority is better
exercised elsewhere.  Attempts to address the broader public interest by
assuring there is adequate children's programming, by regulating mergers, or
by conducting international negotiations should be handled by Congress or
state legislatures in explicit actions or by other agencies such as the
Department of Justice or State.<p>
The case for dramatic reform is now more compelling than ever before.
 Growing global competition, merging markets, and the revolution in digital
and related technologies make the unintended and untoward effects of
government regulation far more costly than in the past.  A regulatory
framework that slows innovation in this area, despite any plausible shortrun
efficiency gains it might achieve, will foreclose a tremendous opportunity
for the American people.
<P><br>

<P>
<B>Testimony</B>
<P>
Introduction<br>
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  It is an honor to be here to testify before this
Committee about the restructuring of the Federal Communications Committee.
 As you know I worked at the FCC for eight years in the 1980s, first as Chief
of the Office of Plans and Policy then as Chief of Staff to Chairman Dennis
Patrick.  Since then I have been in private practice, an adjunct professor at
Georgetown University Law Center, and an adjunct fellow at The Hudson
Institute and The Progress & Freedom Foundation.  I am a member of the PFF
Working Group that last May proposed eliminating most of the FCC's current
functions over the next three years.  Today I am representing PFF and myself
and no one else.<p>
This Congress and this Committee are to be congratulated for passage of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 which creates a new legal and policy playing
field based on the presumption that competition, open entry and market forces
should regulate the telecom industry.  Important as that legislation is, and
it is the most important telecommunications legislation of the last 60 years,
important telecommunications reforms are still needed.  Some might benefit
from legislation.  Others only require diligent oversight by this Committee.
I want to address four broad points.  First,  I want to lay out the case for
 reform.  Second, I will list the structural reforms that should be
implemented over time.  Third, I will discuss reforms that the FCC should
undertake today.  Finally, I want to stress the importance of these reforms
to the American people.<p>
Before I begin I want to be clear about what I am saying and not saying: <br>
<ul>
<li>	I am not here to proclaim the end of communications history.  I am not
saying that all communications regulation by all agencies, federal and state,
is inappropriate.  <p>

<li>	Nor am I saying that my policy prescriptions could be implemented
overnight.  Indeed, even with a free hand, it might take two or three years
to transition to a new system.  As an aside,  additional resources should be
given to the FCC to meet the legislation's mandates, but only if this
Committee is satisfied that the FCC is doing everything it should to pare
back through forbearance and privatization. <p>

<li>	My message is not partisan.  My criticisms of the FCC are systemic.  They
cross administrations.  They span the decades.  Time and again and to this
day well intentioned regulation has hurt consumers, often the poor and those
least well represented in the Washington regulatory game.<p>

<li>	Lastly, because in my eight years at the FCC I got to know many FCC
employees first hand, it is important to me to make explicit that my comments
are not intended to be a criticism of  FCC employees, who perform their jobs
in an exemplary fashion.  The cost of the FCC is not salaries.  The
overriding costs of the FCC are the foregone benefits of competition and
innovation.<p>

Why Dramatic Reform Is Needed<br>
Why replace the FCC?  What's wrong with regulation?   Experience has now
shown us that industries governed by market forces generally work better than
government-run or regulated ones--competition regulates prices and profits
better than the administrative process.  Markets produce objective
information on how consumers and producers value resources and strong
incentives to both to act on this information.  <p>
Regulation, in contrast, comes up short on both counts.  Regulators lack the
necessary information and the proper incentive needed to make prudent
decisions that will most benefit consumers.<p>
Consider spectrum allocation decisions, e.g., the cellular mobile radio and
VHF television allocations were billion dollar debacles.  The FCC's delay of
cellular is estimated to have cost America over $80 billion.  Consider too
the government's current  use of the 6 to 10 GHz of spectrum below 30 GHz
spectrum.  Most experts outside government believe that that spectrum is
underutilized.  <p>
A second failing of the regulatory process is that it is often used by
competitors to delay innovation and competition by several years or even
decades.  Few companies and no trade association can resist the temptation to
use the regulatory process to stymie a competitor or delay a new entrant.
 Most of those efforts have injured consumers.  When it comes to
communications pleadings H.L. Mencken's quip is surely right, &quot;It may be a
sin to think evil of others, but it is seldom a mistake.&quot;  Again let's look
at the record.  It's replete with examples of where regulation impeded
competition and new service such as customer premises equipment, long
distance yesterday and today, cable, video dial tone, VHF drop-ins, low power
TV, and DBS.  <p>
The pace of technical change, especially regarding the digital technologies,
has increased the cost of regulation.  In the old days it was ridiculous for
the FCC to allocate land mobile frequencies on a nationwide basis to narrow
industries, such as taxis and forestry management.  The inevitable
consequence was an overallocation of frequencies to taxis in Boise and an
underallocation in New York City and vice versa for forestry management
frequencies.  Digital technologies make most distinctions between voice and
data and video just as silly and far more expensive.<p>
What Structural Reforms Are Needed<br>
What's the answer?  As this Committee and Congress have recognized in the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, it is to rely more on market forces.  Where
regulation is necessary to check market power, it should seek to preserve the
information-producing  and feedback mechanism of the marketplace.  Subsidies
should be explicit and competitively neutral to minimize their distortive
effect.  Deferring to state regulators and employing case-by-case mechanisms
such as the common law rather than imposing nationwide structural rules will
maximize the opportunity for experimentation.<p>
In accordance with these principles, the current FCC should be replaced with
a much smaller federal agency.  Much of the FCC's current responsibility
should be devolved to the states, transferred to the Department of Justice
and most important of all committed to the marketplace, in the end the true
agency of consumer protection.<p>
FCC regulation can be divided into three parts.  First, there is utility
regulation, that is, the regulation of natural monopoly and universal
service.  Most federal price and profit regulation of telecom markets should
be eliminated, either because the relevant markets are effectively
competitive, regulation is better left to the states, or such federal
regulation is counterproductive.  States should be given principal
responsibility for defining universal service and any federal universal
service subsidies should be made explicit and means-tested.  Regulation of
local exchange facilities should be devolved to the states, subject to
federal guidelines necessary to the development of local competition  and the
assurance that interstate users of local exchange facilities have non
discriminatory access.  I discuss possible forbearance targets below.  
Second, the management of the electromagnetic spectrum should be largely
privatized.  Electromagnetic spectrum allocation decisions should be made
principally by private parties in the marketplace.  Existing spectrum
licensees should be given freedom to use their spectrum as they see fit as
long as they do not interfere with other licensees--their cochannel and
adjacent channel neighbors.  Unallocated private and underutilized federal
spectrum should be made available in flexible assignments.  The assignment of
spectrum should be made through the use of auctions where there are competing
applicants.  I have attached  a detailed proposal for reforming the
electromagnetic spectrum developed by members of the PFF Working Group.  
Third, much of the FCC's general public interest authority is better
exercised elsewhere.  Attempts to address the broader public interest by
assuring there is adequate children's programming, by regulating mergers,  or
by conducting international negotiations should be handled by  Congress or
state legislatures in explicit actions or other agencies such as the
Department of Justice or State.  Regulation of mergers should be done through
antitrust enforcement, not structural rules.  Any federal regulation of
programming content should be by explicit subsidy through legislation or
enforcement in federal court.<p>

Forbearance Actions That Can Be Taken Immediately<br>
The Commission should immediately undertake several deregulatory initiatives
that would benefit consumers, promote competition, and reduce its budgetary
needs.  Some of these initiatives are made possible, indeed required, by the
Telecommunications Act of 1996.   Section 401 of the new law adds a new
provision to the 1934 Communications Act, as amended (new 47 U.S.C. section
160) which requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to forbear
from regulating telecommunications carriers or services, under certain
circumstances.  Other initiatives, especially those that do not pertain to
telecommunications services, can be done under previous Commission authority
and discretion.  For example, the Commission can use self certification and
updated licensing procedures to speed up license transfers and reduce its
resource needs.  Other functions, especially handling public inquiries, could
be streamlined and possibly privatized. <p>
As the Commission seeks to promote competition, it should not delay the
forbearance process.  These and other initiatives should be taken to begin
the FCC's smooth transition to a competitive environment.  Congress should
give the FCC  flexibility to adjust its processes and move its personnel to
expedite this process.  An initial list of forbearance and privatization
proposals prepared by members of the PFF Working Group is attached.  Some of
those recommendations are:<br>
Private Carriage Contracts.  Private carriage promotes competition, the
satisfaction of customers' demand for tailored offerings, and the avoidance
of unnecessary regulatory costs.  There is no good reason to require AT&T,
MCI, Sprint, or other long distance firms to file single-customer offerings.
 Typically, these single-customer offerings appeal to the largest
communications customers, firms which spend millions (and, in several
instances, hundreds of millions) of dollars annually, and which have large,
sophisticated in-house communications staff.  Extensive FCC tariffing
requirements thus serve little of the customer protection role traditionally
associated with tariffing.  Instead, those requirements have become at best
an unneeded  expense and, at worst, a means of price signaling and
coordination.<p>

Computer Inquiry Rules.  The new forbearance law should be applied to
Computer Inquiry rules that prohibit carriers from bundling various services
and equipment and impose other unnecessary requirements.  For example, all
long distance and regional Bell operating companies are prohibited from
bundling basic services with either customer premises equipment or enhanced
services.  Also, AT&T and the Bell companies must:<br>
<ol>
<li> get prior FCC approval of enhanced affiliates' interconnection plans.<p>
<li> disclose changes in basic network interfaces.<p>
 <li> file non-discrimination reports allocate joint and common costs incurred in the provision of basic and
enhanced services.<p>
<li>  In all these cases, where the FCC determines the basic
service involved is effectively competitive, the regulation is no longer
necessary or productive.<p>   
</ul>
Dominant Carrier Reforms.  Steps should be taken to simplify FCC price and
profit regulation of telecommunications companies still deemed to command
&quot;market power.&quot;  The FCC needs to move toward a regime of price, not profit
regulation, by adopting a &quot;pure&quot; incentives-based (&quot;price caps&quot;) regulatory
system, along the lines followed by Britain's progressive Office of Telecommunications. 
 The FCC's current approach &quot;caps&quot; permissible prices for
&quot;interexchange access&quot; based on a complicated formula keyed to the prevailing
rate of inflation and forecasted productivity attainments.  But it also
requires local exchange carriers to &quot;share&quot; profits above a pre-determined
level with customers.  By focusing on the appropriate productivity factor and
eliminating the &quot;sharing formula,&quot;  the FCC could discard all the
paraphernalia associated with traditional rate-base or rate-of-return
regulation, such as depreciation regulation and cost allocation rules.
<p>
Sea Change in Approach.  In every telecommunications proceeding underway, the
FCC should ask if the relevant market is competitive.  If so, it should
refrain from regulating or consider how it can adapt regulation to promote
rather than hinder competition.  An illustration of the need for a dramatic
change in outlook is the FCC's proposal to impose mandatory resale on paging
operators.  That  market has numerous competitors and no serious observer
contends that it is not effectively competitive. <p>
This approach should also be taken as to the rulemakings required by the new
law.  Two examples include the rulemakings the FCC must undertake to promote
geographic averaged rates and universal service.  Imposing geographically
averaged rates is inconsistent with competition.   Long distance competition
could be distorted by companies limiting their activities to low cost
regions.  In that case national carriers might find it difficult to compete
in those areas.  Under the forbearance section, the FCC should find that
competitive concerns require any geographic averaging of rates to be limited
and transitional. Similarly, universal service subsidies must be reduced and
targeted to those who need them.  Market-based mechanisms can be fashioned to
phase  out unnecessary subsidies that could distort and impede the
development of competition.<p>

License Transfers and other changes.  The Commission reviews the assignment
and transfer of all broadcast stations.  Instead, it could adopt a
self-certification approach that would put the onus on the buyer who would
certify that all the relevant statutes and FCC regulations have been met.
 The FCC should where necessary clarify its regulations to ease the
certification process and use audits as the basis for determining compliance.
 Alternatively, the FCC could select a self regulating organization (SRO)
which could review all license transfers and assignments.  Self certification
of transfers and assignments would likely be supported by the industry as
evidenced by its endorsement by Broadcasting and Cable magazine.  
<p>
Why Reform Is Important<br>
We are all familiar with the rapid change in the computer industry.  In the
space of five years, IBM lost roughly $70 billion dollars of market
capitalization.  In the same period, many small hardware and software
companies grew exponentially, more than offsetting those mainframe losses.
 Who can seriously question the likelihood that if Apple, Intel, Compaq and
Microsoft had required FCC approval to get to the market, the personal
computer revolution would have been postponed.<p>
The case for dramatic reform is now more compelling than ever before.
 Growing global competition, merging markets and the revolution in digital
and related technologies make the unintended and untoward effects of
government regulation far more costly than in the past.  Heightened
competition has often undercut the rationale for regulation.  Moreover, the
increasing pace of change makes the costs of regulatory delay increasingly
unacceptable.<p>
Fundamental reform of the FCC would unleash innovative and entrepreneurial
forces and would build on the U.S.'s current but perishable lead in the
global digital derby.  Reform of the electromagnetic spectrum, alone, could
promote the development of competition in local telecommunications markets
and create a raft of new wireless digital services and devices.  America is
positioned to leave other countries in a cloud of silicon dust.  A regulatory
framework that slows innovation in this area, despite any plausible shortrun
efficiency gains it might achieve, will foreclose a tremendous opportunity
for the American people.<p>

<title>A Tax Code To Love? -- Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3> A Tax Code To Love?</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>March 25, 1996
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Don't look now but it's that time of the year again. The dreaded tax season is here. To say that most Americans don't like the current tax system understates the obvious. 	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	That's because it truly is a mess. Americans struggle to comply with a tax system that has more than 400 different forms. The amount of time individuals and businesses spend collecting all the needed data and filling out all the required forms: an estimated 5 billion hours each year.  What a waste!
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	And compliance isn't cheap. Individuals, families and businesses spend an estimated $200 billion per year on accountants and lawyers to satisfy the Internal Revenue Service. Just think how crazy that is: The government will throw you in jail if you don't pay taxes according to a scheme it has made so confusing you have to hire a lawyer to figure it out! 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	There has to be a better way. And there is. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	By now I'm sure you've heard all sorts of claims about an idea that is frequently discussed by economists, realtors, policy-makers and presidential contenders alike: the flat tax.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Just so you know, the reason so many people in high places want you to reject the flat tax is because they are the ones leeching benefits from the current system, and they don't want anybody messing with their cash cow.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The flat tax works like this: All taxpayers would pay the same tax rate, for example, 17 percent. No confusing tax schedules, no steep accountants fees; just one form, the size of a postcard. The rich would pay far more in taxes than the everybody else -- contrary to critics' claims -- since, after all, 17 percent of a million dollars is a lot more money than 17 percent of $35,000. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	A <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi90.html">study</a> by my colleagues at The Heritage Foundation recently showed that the flat tax <a href="gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/0waisdocid%3A/USHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th.src%3ATEXT%3A79219%3A1%3Ddiamond%3A210%3B2%3DUSHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th%3B3%3D5136314%2079219%20/usr/wais/data/USHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th/tl04.house.jul95.wais.data%3B4%3Ddiamond%3A210%3B5%3DUSHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th%3B6%3D5136314%2079219%20/usr/wais/data/USHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th/tl04.house.jul95.wais.data%3B7%3D%2500%3B">proposed</a> by House Majority Leader Richard Armey, R-Texas, and Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., -- one of several proposals under consideration -- would lower taxes on all income groups, especially the poor and middle class. The plan's generous deduction, $33,000 for a family of four, would exempt most low-income households from any federal income tax. Some 24 million families that pay taxes now would pay none under the plan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Also, unlike the current system, which may tax the same dollar up to four different times (the personal income tax, the corporate income tax, the capital gains tax, and the estate tax), dividend and interest earnings from savings and investment would not be taxed. In other words, instead of being penalized for investing your money, you would be taxed just once 3/4 when you earn the money. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	This would encourage more Americans to put their money to work in the economy -- and instead of dragging the economy down, the tax system would start revving it up.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Of course, one of the most attractive features of a flat tax is its simplicity. Everyone who has wrestled with a Schedule C or a 1040 form or has had to collect receipts for every charitable contribution in the mad rush to get everything in the mail by April 15 could simply -- and quickly -- fill out a postcard-sized form. What literally once required hours could be done in a few minutes during your lunch hour! 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	But before you get too excited, remember: A lot of special interests don't want to part with the advantages (a tax break for this, a loophole for that, a deduction here, an allowance there) that the current tax system gives them. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Practically everyone agrees that America's tax system needs a major overhaul. Instead of spending precious time cursing the tax code, perhaps our lawmakers will soon replace it with one that everyone (except the special interests, of course) can love.

<title>Lower Education --  Heritage Commentary</title><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>

<h2>Lower Education</h2>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
March 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ever wonder why most young people -- even those who have attended prestige colleges or universities -- don't seem to know a whole lot about life or the world around them? 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It could be because in the headlong pursuit of top-rated sports teams, expensive, over-specialized research facilities, and -- let's be frank -- money, America's most prestigious colleges and universities have forgotten their basic task: to teach students something about history, literature, mathematics, the natural sciences, foreign language, philosophy and English. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The reason most "Generation Xers" don't come away from college with such a "bottom-line" education is simple: It's no longer required of them.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I don't make this accusation lightly. According to a study just released by the National Association of Scholars (NAS), America's leading schools of "higher" education have eliminated most of the core academic requirements once considered essential to a liberal-arts education. At the 50 colleges and universities identified by U.S. News & World Report as "America's best," the commitment to a structured general education "has largely vanished" over the past 30 years. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In short, there has been "a purging from the curriculum of many of the required basic survey courses that used to familiarize students with the historical, cultural, political and scientific foundations of their society," the NAS study shows.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Of course, the study merely quantifies what many of us have been observing about American education for decades: U.S. educators have forgotten what education is all about. According to NAS President Stephen Balch, America is "in danger of losing the common frame of cultural reference that for many generations has sustained our liberal, democratic society."  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;According to the NAS study, the number of top schools that require what we used to call "freshman English" has dropped to just over one-third. Only 12 percent still require math; only 34 percent require students to study science; only 2 percent require the study of history; only 4 percent have required courses in philosophy; and not a single one of the top schools requires students to study great literature.    
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even the school year has been shortened, from an average of 191 days in 1964 to only 156 classroom days in 1993. 	
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	"To a considerable extent, the structured curriculum was dashed to pieces during the late 1960s and early 1970s when the rage in higher education was a radical libertarianism based on notions of `relevance' and the assumption that a special insight belonged to youth," the NAS study states. As a result, colleges and universities today "can no longer guarantee that students acquire a basic knowledge of their civilization and its heritage." 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The product of all this, in the words of my late friend, philosopher <a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklink.html">Russell Kirk</a>, is "lax institutions at which every lad and lass can succeed, because all standards for entrance or graduation have been swept away." We end up with students "able to ascertain the price of everything -- but the value of nothing." 	
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	That's what you get, dear parent, for $10,000 to $25,000 per year and rising, when you send your son or daughter to America's most prestigious colleges and universities.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	If I were you, before I spent that kind of money, I'd get my hands on the NAS study, send it to the president of the college or university your child has chosen, and demand a response.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

</B>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Comments by  Foundation President Jeff Eisenach  on ABC's Nightline</B><BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<p>
"The United States is unambiguously still today, thank goodness, the leader in medical technology but that intelligence, that human capital is literally getting on an airplane and flying to Europe and setting up shop and setting up households in Europe.<p><p>

"We simply think the process should be decentralized, that much of the work should be moved out of the hands of government bureaucracies into efficient private sector agencies.  But the same level of safety and efficiency ought to be demanded  both by the private sector companies that are doing the certification and also the FDA and in its final approval.<p><p>

Dr. Eisenach was also quoted in the Wall Street Journal on this subject:  "The FDA, instead of being a 'certifier of products' would become a 'certifier of certifiers,' ensuring that the private entities uphold the agency's standards, he said."

<I><FONT SIZE ="+2">W</FONT>elcome</I> to the American Conservative Union's "Legislative Update" page.  On this page you will
find regular updates on the key legislation we are tracking, as the legislation moves from
introduction to subcommittee and committee hearings, subcommittee and committee markups,
and floor action in both the House and Senate.  On any given day, this is where you can get the
latest information available on the key issues conservatives care about.
<P>
As the nation's oldest conservative grass-roots lobbying organization, founded more than three
decades ago, the ACU sees its proper role as being the grass-roots lobby for the entire
Conservative Movement.  As such, we are not a single-issue organization.  Our officers, staff, and
-- most importantly -- our members are motivated toward public policy activism by the shared
beliefs explained in the ACU Statement of Principles.
<P>
Because the ACU is a multi-issue, umbrella organization, we monitor and lobby on a wide range
of issues before the Congress.  For ease in tracking those various pieces of legislation, we have
broken them down into four general categories:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Economic and Budget issues (examples:  the Balanced Budget Amendment; the Tax
     Limitation Amendment; the Budget Resolution; tax legislation; health care reform
     legislation; legislation to raise the debt ceiling; the Mexico bailout; etc.)
<LI>Social and Cultural issues (examples:  the Crime Bill; welfare reform; a school prayer
     amendment; abortion legislation; homosexual rights legislation; educational choice; etc.)
<li>Foreign Policy and Defense issues (examples:  ballistic missile defenses; the United
Nations; Bosnia; Haiti; the foreign aid bill; the War Powers Act; etc.)
<LI>Institutional Reform issues (examples:  term limits; campaign finance reform; budget
     process reform; repeal of the 16th Amendment, which instituted the income tax; lobbying
     reform; etc.)

<title>Why the House Health Insurance Reform Bill Would Help Achieve True Health Care Reform - Heritage</title>

<center>
<h3>WHY THE HOUSE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM BILL WOULD HELP ACHIEVE TRUE HEALTH CARE REFORM</h3>
By John C. Liu<br>
<P>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder Update No. 271<br>
March 26, 1996<br>
<p>
(Updating <I>Issue Bulletin</I> No. 222, <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/ib222.html">"A Guide to Kassebaum-Kennedy,"</a> March 22, 1996.)
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House of Representatives soon will consider major health insurance reform legislation approved by the Committees on Commerce, Ways and Means, and Economic and Educational Opportunities.<sup>1</sup>  The Health Coverage Availability and Affordability Act of 1996, a legislative proposal being coordinated by Representative Dennis Hastert (R-IL), contains many of the structural improvements needed in today's health insurance market.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The reforms would enable Americans to keep their health insurance should they change or lose their jobs. They also would generate more genuine competition among insurance carriers and other health plan providers, thereby controlling costs through free-market forces. In addition to making health insurance more available and portable, the House proposal would address the more immediate and pressing concern facing millions of Americans -- the affordability of health insurance. It would do this by changing the tax treatment of health insurance, creating medical savings accounts (MSAs), and expanding tax relief for health insurance. This would give Americans more personal choice of health care services and make it possible for more families to own their health plans.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Increasing the Availability of Insurance.</b> The House proposal would restrict the ability of health plans and employers to limit or deny group health insurance coverage to 12 months for medical conditions diagnosed in the previous 6 months. The limitation period on preexisting conditions would be reduced by the length of time that a worker and his dependents were continuously covered under any prior plan. In addition, the proposal would prohibit an insurance company from imposing any further preexisting condition exclusions if the employee had been covered under another group health plan at the time coverage was offered, and would prohibit health plans from excluding or canceling coverage for any employee in the employer group plan based on a preexisting condition or health status. Thus, workers who changed jobs would no longer be subjected to waiting periods. The absence of portability in group health insurance, now confronting millions of workers who want to change jobs, would be alleviated in the proposed group-to-group provision.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
More important, the House bill would help create a consumer-based health insurance system by making individual ownership of health policies much easier. Individuals would be guaranteed health insurance coverage if they met certain specific requirements.<sup>2</sup> 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Guaranteed issue and the availability of health insurance in the individual market would be achieved under the bill by forbidding insurance carriers from imposing eligibility, continuation, or enrollment requirements based on health status, medical condition, claims experience, or medical history. These rules would guarantee the portability of health insurance for workers and their families in the individual market. Under current law, individuals switching from an employer who provides health insurance to another employer who does not will lose coverage. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The concern has been raised that a guaranteed issue requirement would sharply raise the premiums on individual-based policies. Estimates vary, with some projecting increases of 2 to 5 percent, and others placing the increase between 10 and 15 percent.<sup>3</sup>  Because real consumer choice and genuine market competition are virtually non-existent in today's distorted health insurance market, it is inevitable that premiums would increase somewhat in the individual market under a guaranteed issue requirement. And since only employer-based health insurance is completely tax free, individuals who purchase it on their own must pay the entire cost of the higher premiums in after-tax dollars. Without any change in this tax treatment, healthier-than-average individuals would be more likely to decline insurance under a guaranteed issue requirement, while unhealthy persons would be more likely to purchase coverage, driving up average premiums. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Fortunately, the House proposal makes two key adjustments in the federal tax code that would help offset the increase in premiums.
<p><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>1.) Medical savings accounts.</b> The bill creates medical savings accounts (MSAs). As drafted, MSAs would enable group-to-individual conversions to have a significant impact on today's uninsured population. While there are other forms of tax equity Congress should consider, such as the comprehensive system of tax credits proposed in 1994 by Senator Don Nickles (R-OK) and Representative Cliff Stearns (R-FL) and 100 percent deductions for the self-employed, MSAs are a good start. They would provide an incentive for healthy individuals to purchase at least catastrophic health insurance, thereby creating a solid and solvent risk pool to help offset the claims of future unhealthy enrollees.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>2) An increased tax deduction for the self-employed.</b> Under current law, self-employed individuals are permitted to deduct 30 percent of the amount paid for health insurance for themselves and their dependents. The House bill would increase the deduction to 50 percent by 2003.<sup>4</sup>  While this would help, the federal tax code would remain biased against employees in employer-based health plans who prefer the security of choosing and owning their own plan. The House thus should establish at least a 50 percent deduction for all individuals purchasing health insurance, not just the self-employed.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Small Employer Pooling.</b> The House bill would allow smaller businesses to join together under the auspices of ERISA to purchase insurance coverage or to cover their employees under self-insured multiple employer health plans (MEHPs).<sup>5</sup>  Eighty-five percent of uninsured Americans are in households headed by a worker. The House proposal uses ERISA to preempt any state laws prohibiting groups of employers from obtaining fully insured health insurance coverage through a multiple employer arrangement.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House bill also would eliminate confusion surrounding the responsibilities of the states and the U.S. Department of Labor under ERISA. This confusion has helped insurance swindlers and bogus unions hide behind the ERISA preemption clause. The House proposal would clarify the law and give legitimate self-insured associations (including church plans, franchise networks, trade associations, and certain collectively bargained plans) two clear and distinct regulatory options.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
First, legitimate associations could maintain or establish multiple employer health plans by seeking licensure in a state permitting such practices. Alternatively, they could seek federal certification under the "exemption" provision in current ERISA law. Second, the House bill makes clear that entities created for the express purpose of purchasing health insurance would be subject to the laws of the state in which they seek to do business rather than ERISA. The states could make these groups meet any state-defined insurance or multiple employer plan licensing requirements.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Smaller employers and individuals are at a disadvantage when attempting to negotiate premium rates with insurance carriers. The wrong way to deal with this would be for Congress to create government-sponsored health insurance purchasing cooperatives and impose new federal regulations. By giving smaller employers and the self-employed the right to take advantage of the economies of scale available under ERISA, the House proposal would make it much easier for small firms to obtain this expensive health insurance.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House legislation would be a big step toward genuine health care reform because it addresses the principal reason why Americans have been demanding health insurance reform -- their fear of losing current health benefits or being unable to afford coverage. Further, the bill begins to tackle the root cause of the financing problems -- the tax bias against purchasing health insurance outside an employer. By doing this, the House proposal would give Americans the desirable components of health care reform that were the casualties of the battle over the Clinton health plan:  availability, affordability, portability, and -- above all -- the security that comes with personally owned health insurance.
<p>
<b>Endnotes:</b>
<ol><p>
<li>These three committees have jurisdiction over particular aspects of health insurance legislation. The Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee reported out H.R. 995 on March 6, 1996; the Ways and Means Committee reported out H.R. 3103 on March 19; and the Commerce Committee reported out H.R. 3070 on March 20. The House of Representatives is expected to vote on a final version combining specific provisions from these three bills on March 28, 1996.<p>
<li>Among these requirements:  1) The individual must have been covered under one or more group health plans for at least 18 months; 2) the individual is not eligible for coverage under another group health plan (new employer or spouse's employer); and 3) if eligible for COBRA coverage (or a similar state continuation of coverage program), the individual would have to have elected and exhausted such coverage.<p>
<li>Thomas J. Stoiber, FSA, MAAA, written communication to Committee on Labor and Human Resources, U.S. Senate, August 2, 1995, p. 2; Mary N. Lehnhard, Senior Vice President, Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, testimony before the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, U.S. Senate, July 18, 1995.<p>
<li>It should be noted that a similar provision to increase the 30 percent deduction to 50 percent was passed by Congress in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. This proposal was vetoed by President Clinton.<p>
<li>The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA, P.L. 93-406) prohibits states from treating self-insured firms as insurance carriers and making them subject to state regulations.

</head>
<body>
<center>
<h2>Hot Issues<p>
Whitewater</h2>
<br>
Friday, March 22, 1996
<p>
</center>



<hr>The following letter from ACU Chairman David Keene was delivered to the United State Senate on March 
18, 1996:<br>                 
        <p>
        
        Dear Senator:<br>
        <p>

        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I urge you to support an unlimited extension of the Special
        Whitewater Investigative Committee when the matter comes to the Senate floor this week.<p>
        
        While it is undeniably true that the Whitewater investigation has been going on for quite
        some time, it is also undeniably true that many in the Clinton White House and the
        Administration have displayed a callous, flagrant disregard for the subpoenas served on
        them.  On numerous occasions, documents subpoenaed months and even years ago have
        miraculously been &quot;discovered&quot; out of the blue.  Just in the past ten weeks, this has
        happened on four separate occasions, with the most recent &quot;discovery&quot; coming just a few
        days ago, when the White House released Counsel Bruce Lindsey's notes of a meeting
        long past.<p>
        
        No rational person could observe this pattern developing and not question whether or not
        the White House was complying fully with the Senate investigation, as the President
        promised it would.  Instead, it looks as if the White House has something to hide, and that
        someone there believes that if they just hold out long enough, the Senate committee will
        run out of time and money, and the danger -- whatever it might be -- will have passed.
        
        For that reason, we urge you to support not only an extension of the Whitewater
        Committee, but an indefinite extension.  Putting a time limit on it -- as some Democratic
        Senate leaders have suggested -- would merely tell anyone continuing to hold back
        documents how much longer they had to hide them before the threat was passed.<p>
        
        The American people want this investigation concluded, but they also want it concluded
        with no doubts left as to the facts of the matter.  Otherwise, the time and money spent
        already would be a waste.<p>
       
<Pre>
                          Yours sincerely,
        
        
               

                          David A. Keene

<h2><i>Hawaii's Assault on Matrimony</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>T</font>he Hawaii Commission on Sexual Orientation 
recently voted 5-2 to recommend that same-sex couples be granted 
identical legal status now conferred on married couples.  The majority 
report declared that the denial of the &quot;benefits&quot; of marriage
&quot;purely on the basis of gender&quot; is a violation of &quot;basic
human rights&quot; enshrined in Hawaii's constitution.[1]

<p>

While the Commission's recommendation is non-binding, it
coincides with other pro-homosexual activity in the judicial and
executive branches of Hawaii's state government.  If these efforts
succeed, the institution of marriage will not only be affected
in America's 50th state, but in the other 49 as well.

<p>

In making its recommendation, a majority of the Hawaii Commission
on Sexual Orientation concluded that denial of marriage licenses
to same-sex couples deprived applicants of legal and economic
benefits, including:

<p><ol>

<li>joint parental custody;<br>
<li>insurance and health benefits;<br>
<li>the ability to file joint tax returns;<br>
<li>alimony and child support; and<br>
<li>inheritance of property and visitation of a partner or child in 
the hospital.

</ol><p>

The majority also concluded that legalization of same-sex
&quot;marriage&quot; would be an economic boon to Hawaii, as homosexuals
would flock there to get married.  (Apparently, they ignored the
possibility that traditional honeymooners may choose another destination,
and that more than 97 percent of the population is heterosexual.)

<font size=+1><b><i>
Making gay 'marriage' legal would<br>
impose it on all the citizens of<br>
Hawaii, and perhaps even on people<br>
in the rest of the United States.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The Commission's minority report took issue with virtually
every assertion made by the majority, and cited medical, social,
historical and legal authorities to make the case that same-sex
&quot;marriage&quot; would encourage homosexuality and therefore
aggravate health problems associated with homosexual behavior,
hurt the island state economically because of possible boycotts,
and undermine the moral fabric of Hawaiian society.  The report
charged the majority with bullying witnesses, altering the official
record of meetings, rudely interrupting minority members and
generally suppressing information.

<p>

The minority concluded that granting marital status to homosexuals
would imperil marriage itself and bring Hawaii into conflict with
the other 49 states.  Its recommendations:

<p><ul><i>

<li>The Legislature should adopt a Constitutional Amendment
preserving marriage and the marital partnership as between one
man and one woman as husband and wife.

<p>

<li>The legal and economic benefits conferred on married couples
in the state of Hawaii should not be extended to homosexual and/or
&quot;common law marriage&quot; couples because the cost is too
great.

<p>

<li>The legal and economic benefits conferred on married couples
in the state of Hawaii should not be extended to homosexual couples
for all the same reasons these benefits are not extended to unmarried
heterosexual couples engaged in &quot;common law marriage&quot;
in Hawaii.

</ul>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b>
Other relationships have not been<br>
accorded the same status as marriage<br>
because they do not contribute in the<br>
same way to a community. No society<br>
can survive without marriages and<br>
families.
</b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

<li>Rather than extend marital benefits to homosexual couples,
the legislature should modify statutes defining family to include
all those who share a household, which would include homosexual
couples as families.  However, the cost of doing so must be analyzed.

<p>

<li>The legislature must create a very broad religious freedom
exemption covering religious institutions and individuals who
have religiously motivated objections to treating same-sex partnerships
as marriage-equivalents.

</i></ul><p>

The latter recommendations seem to be fall-back positions
in case the state goes ahead with some sort of change in family
status.  Recommendation &quot;D&quot; is an unwise move toward
redefinition of family, and is surprising in light of the minority's
conclusion that &quot;homosexuality is a psychological pathology
and should not be encouraged.&quot;[2]

<p>

Commissioner Lloyd James Hochberg, Jr., who voted in the
minority, told <i>The New York Times</i>, &quot;Why would we want
to take a pathological condition and make it the equivalent of
heterosexual marriage as a goal that society is teaching children?
Once homosexual marriage or domestic partnership is permitted,
the schools are going to have to teach that it's equivalent.&quot;[3]

<p>

<center><h3>Background</h3></center>

<p>

In May 1993, the Hawaiian Supreme Court ruled 3-1 in <i>Baehr
v. Lewin</i>[4] that the state's exclusion of same-sex couples from
marital status may be unconstitutional because it amounts to discrimination.
Two homosexual men had applied for a marriage license, were denied,
and then sued the state.  The case eventually made its way to
the state Supreme Court, which remanded it to a lower court with
instructions to the state to prove &quot;compelling state interests&quot;
for limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples.

<p>

The lower court is expected to rule on the case in July 1996.
If the State of Hawaii loses the case, and the court thereby
legalizes same-sex marriage, it can appeal to the state Supreme
Court. But that is unlikely because the governor and the lieutenant
governor are on record as favoring same-sex marriage and/or domestic
partnerships (legal equivalency of marriage without the term 
&quot;marriage&quot;).

<p>

In April 1994, the Hawaiian legislature overwhelmingly passed
a bill (21-4 in the Senate and 36-12 in the House) reaffirming
the traditional one-man, one-woman definition of marriage.  If
the lower court rules for same-sex marriage, it would strike down
this state law.  A likely reaction would be a voters' drive for
a constitutional amendment to replace the stricken statute.  Meanwhile,
other states are already moving to protect the traditional definition
of marriage.

<p>

<center><h3>Majority v. Minority Reports</h3></center>

<p>

The minority report begins with a wry observation:  &quot;The
irony of this 'minority' report is that its conclusions actually
reflect the view of a majority of Hawaii's residents.&quot;[5]
Indeed, a series of polls revealed that two-thirds of Hawaiians
disapprove of same-sex &quot;marriage.&quot;[6] Even so, many observers
expect the liberal Hawaiian courts to mandate gay &quot;marriage.&quot;

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>
Gay 'marriage' is an oxymoron, an<br>
ideological invention designed to<br>
appropriate the moral capital of<br>
marriage and family toward the goal<br>
of government-enforced acceptance of<br>
homosexuality. As such, the term is<br>
a counterfeit and a fraud.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Hawaii has earned a reputation for being on &quot;the cutting
edge&quot; of social experimentation.  It was the first state
to legalize abortion (1970), the first to ratify the Equal Rights
Amendment (1972) and the fifth to offer special employment protections
to homosexuals (1991).

<p>

The majority report, mimicking arguments used by homosexual
activists, compares the same-sex quest for marital status with
the civil rights struggle by black Americans.  Most prominently
cited is an interracial couple's victory in <i>Loving v. Virginia</i>.[7]
In that historic case, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down laws
preventing marriage between people of different races as violating
the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth
Amendment to the Constitution.

<p>

But the court never came close to redefining the institution
of marriage itself, which is what would have to occur for same-sex
relationships to be accorded marital status.  The false equation
of a benign, nonbehavioral characteristic such as skin color with
an orientation based precisely on behavior finds no support within
the law.  Perhaps it is no wonder that the majority equates all
sexual behavior.  At the very first meeting of the commission
the majority voted to ban all discussion of homosexuality because
some members might find it offensive or inflammatory.[8] Thus, the
truth about homosexual behavior was deliberately kept out of 
the proceedings.

<p>

The majority report also cites a number of flawed studies
to give the impression that homosexuality and heterosexuality
are essentially no different and have no implications for health
or for the well-being of children.  The report provides no medical
data to sustain its assertion that &quot;testimonies stating [that]
the extension of benefits to same-gender couples would threaten
public health are inaccurate.&quot;  The report also states that
&quot;there is no evidence that children of gay and lesbian parents
develop any differently than [sic] the children of opposite-sex
parents.&quot;[9] In making this point, the report ignores considerable
evidence that children are more likely to experiment with homosexuality
or identify as homosexuals when raised in a homosexual household.[10]

<p>

The majority expresses an odd understanding of the role of
morality and the law when it states, &quot;[W]hile each person
has the right to practice their individual religious and moral
beliefs, they do not have the right to impose those on others.&quot;[11]
Making gay &quot;marriage&quot; legal would impose it on all
the citizens of Hawaii, and perhaps even on people in the rest
of the United States.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>
Same-sex 'marriage' threatens not<br>
only the integrity of the marital<br>
definition but also religious freedom.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The majority goes on to state, &quot;Under our constitutional
government the fact that some religious [sic] or churches condemn
same-sex marriages does not mean that those religious beliefs
can be imposed on others.&quot;[12] In the very next paragraph, the
report notes, &quot;The Buddhists asked the Commission to support
stable relationships between loving people regardless of whether
those people are the same gender.&quot;[13] So, while saying that
no religion can impose its beliefs on others,  the report openly
and unselfconsciously adopts the Buddhist position.  Incidentally,
the commission itself was formed, then regrouped, only after two
representatives from the Catholic Church and two Mormons were expelled 
on grounds of &quot;separation of church and state.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>Societal Implications</h3></center>

<p>

In the 1970s, homosexuals unsuccessfully challenged marriage
laws in Minnesota, Kentucky and Washington state.  In the Minnesota
case, the state Supreme Court noted, &quot;The institution of
marriage as a union of man and woman, uniquely involving the procreating
and rearing of children within a family, is as old as the book
of Genesis....This historic institution is more deeply founded
than the asserted contemporary concept of marriage and societal
interests for which petitioners contend.&quot;[14]

<p>

Other relationships have not been accorded the same status
as marriage because they do not contribute in the same way to
a community. To put it bluntly, societies can get along quite
well -- in fact, better -- without same-sex sexual relationships,
but no society can survive without marriages and families.  In
fact, because the term &quot;heterosexual marriage&quot; is redundant,
the term &quot;marriage&quot; will mean in this essay what it
has always meant:  the social, legal and spiritual union of a
man and a woman.  &quot;Gay marriage&quot; is an oxymoron, an
ideological invention designed to appropriate the moral capital
of marriage and family toward the goal of government-enforced
acceptance of homosexuality. As such, the term &quot;gay marriage&quot;
is a counterfeit and a fraud.  It would undermine support for
marriage by ending marriage's unique legal and cultural status.
It would also undermine support for natural families, whose
foundation is marriage.

<p>

Same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; threatens not only the integrity
of the marital definition but also religious freedom.  Although
the majority report recommends that religious institutions not
be forced to perform same-sex ceremonies, it offers no defense
for the conscientious Christian, Jew or Muslim (or Hindu or atheist,
for that matter) who will not legally recognize same-sex 
&quot;marriage.&quot; Law carries the potential use of force against 
those who will not abide by it.  If a businessman declines to extend 
marital benefits to same-sex couples, the law would open him to lawsuits
and state coercion.  Schools would be forced to teach the acceptability
of gay &quot;marriage&quot; in family life courses.  Homosexuals'
efforts to adopt children would be made easier if marriage is
stripped of its unique status.

<p>

All institutions except specifically religious ones would
be subjected to state enforcement.  That would include Christian
bookstores, radio and TV stations, and other nondenominational
businesses owned by religious people.  And religious institutions
themselves may enjoy immunity only for a short time.  &quot;Religious
exemption&quot; implies that the policy itself is at odds with
the moral order, but when push comes to shove, the state often
prevails.  For example, the Supreme Court swept away Bob Jones
University's tax-exempt status because the college, citing religious
reasons,  prohibited interracial dating.  The justices said that
the state's compelling interest in ensuring equality overrode
the college's religious views.  Almost all Christians would view
the university's stance as unbiblical, but the point is that religious
freedom is at the sufferance of the courts, which are acting increasingly
like lawmakers instead of law interpreters.  Religious freedom
can be curtailed anytime a court decides the state wants to do
so for &quot;compelling&quot; reasons.  Religious exemptions,
therefore, are most likely a temporary step on the way to total
acceptance of homosexuality.

<p>

<center><h3>Other States Fight Back</h3></center>

<p>

A constitutional conflict looms should the Hawaii court legalize
gay &quot;marriage,&quot; because under the U.S. Constitution's
full faith and credit clause, states must accord reciprocity to
other states in such matters as marriage and drivers' licenses.
So, theoretically, a homosexual couple could marry in Honolulu,
move to California and demand that the Golden State recognize
their &quot;marriage.&quot;  Because states do vary in their marital
requirements (such as minimum age), the general rule has been
to apply the law of the state where the marriage was performed
to determine a marriage's validity,  unless it &quot;violates
the strong public policy&quot; of the state in which the couple
reside.[15]

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Observers in some states have already moved to bolster this
common law protection by making the point more explicitly.

<p><ul>

<li>In March, 1995, Utah's legislators voted to deny recognition
of any out-of-state marriages that do not conform to Utah law.

<p>

<li>In South Dakota, a similar bill (H1184) passed the House
of Representatives but failed by one vote to get on the Senate
calendar.

<p>

<li>In Alaska, a bill was introduced in early 1995 to make clear
that &quot;marriage is a civil contract entered into by one man
and one woman.&quot;

<p>

<li>In Minnesota in 1993, a bill (H3016) which specified that
&quot;a marriage contracted between persons of the same gender
and recognized as valid in another state is not valid in this
state&quot; failed in a House committee.

<p>

<li>In New Hampshire in 1994, a bill (SB557) failed in a Senate
committee that would have barred recognition of  marriage &quot;between
persons of the same gender.&quot;  Even this might have proved
ineffective given the ongoing drive by feminists at United Nations-sponsored
conferences on women to redefine gender into no less than five
categories (male heterosexual, female heterosexual, male homosexual,
female homosexual and transsexual/bisexual).

<p>

<li>In early 1996, marriage protection bills were introduced in several 
state legislatures, including California, Idaho and Washington. 
Legislators in other states, such as Alabama, Virginia and Georgia, 
were preparing bills.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>The Importance of Definition</h3></center>

<p>

In all cultural struggles, a primary battleground is the
use of language.  Compromising the integrity of a term or phrase
can advance a particular agenda, or, at least, sow confusion
and uncertainty.  A term such as &quot;marriage&quot; can either
lose the power of its original meaning or be commandeered to mean
something entirely different.  In 1828, Noah Webster defined 
&quot;marriage&quot; as:

<p><blockquote>

<i>The act of uniting a man and woman for life; wedlock;  the
legal union of a man and woman for life.  Marriage is a contract
both civil and religious, by which the parties engage to live
together in mutual affection and fidelity, till death shall separate
them.  Marriage was instituted by God himself for the purpose
of preventing the promiscuous intercourse of the sexes, for domestic
felicity, and for securing the maintenance and education of children.
&quot;Marriage is honorable in all and the bed undefiled.
Heb. xiii.&quot;</i>[16]

</blockquote>

<font size=+1><b><i>
One can no more 'expand' a definition<br>
or moral principle than one can<br>
continually expand a yardstick and<br>
still use it as a reliable measure.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

A more recent (1981) <i>Webster's</i> definition retains
the essential elements of the earlier version:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Marriage\ a: the state of being united to a person of the opposite
sex as husband or wife b: the mutual relation of husband and wife:
wedlock c: the institution whereby men and women are joined in
a special kind of social and legal dependence for the purpose
of founding and maintaining a family.</i>[17]

</blockquote><p>

No jurisdictional unit in the United States -- town, city,
or state -- recognizes same-sex couples as &quot;married.&quot;
In 1975, Boulder, Colorado granted a marriage license to a same-sex
couple, but it was struck down by a federal court in 1982. Protections
favoring marriage are built into the law and the culture because
of the central importance of the family unit as the building block
of civilization.  In 1888, the U.S. Supreme Court described marriage
&quot;as creating the most important relation in life, as having
more to do with the morals and civilization of a people than any
other institution.&quot;[18]

<p>

However, some jurisdictions are moving toward redefining
the family to include same-sex relationships, and there is a movement
within the legal community to overhaul the definitions of marriage
and family.  A note in the <I>Harvard Law Review</I> in 1991 advocated
replacing the formal definition of family with an elastic standard
based &quot;mainly on the strength or duration of emotional bonds,&quot;
regardless of sexual orientation.  The note recommends redefining
the family through &quot;domestic partner&quot; or family 
&quot;registration&quot; statutes that go beyond the limited benefits now 
conferred by existing domestic partnership laws so as to &quot;achieve 
parity&quot; between marriage and other relationships.[19]

<p>

In 1990, San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos appointed lesbian
activist Roberta Achtenberg (later Assistant Secretary of the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under President
Clinton) to chair the Mayor's Task Force on Family Policy.  The
final report of the task force defines the family this way:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;A unit of interdependent and interacting persons, related
together over time by strong social and emotional bonds and/or
by ties of marriage, birth, and adoption, whose central purpose
is to create, maintain, and promote the social, mental, physical
and emotional development and well being of each of its 
members.&quot;</i>[20]

</blockquote>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
This definition is so vague that<br>
multiple-partner unions are not<br>
excluded, nor any imaginable<br>

point is to demote marriage to a<br>
level with all other relationships.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

In this definition, which could reasonably be described as
a formulation by homosexual activists, marriage is no longer the
foundation for families but secondary to &quot;strong social and
emotional bonds.&quot;  This definition is so vague that multiple-partner
unions are not excluded, nor any imaginable combination of persons,
including a fishing boat crew.  The whole point is to demote marriage
to a level with all other relationships.

<p>

To place same-sex relationships on a par with marriage destroys
the definition of marriage altogether.  When the meaning of a
word becomes nonspecific, the exclusivity that it previously defined
is lost.  For instance, if the state of Hawaii decided to extend
the famous -- and exclusive -- &quot;Maui onion&quot; appellation
to all onions grown in Hawaii -- even on, say, Oahu --, the term
&quot;Maui onion&quot; would lose its original meaning.  Consumers
would lack confidence in buying a bag of &quot;Maui onions&quot;
if all onions could be labeled as such.  The same goes for any
brand name. Wine from California could be falsely labeled as wine
from Bordeaux, France, thus destroying the uniqueness of both
appellations.  If &quot;marriage&quot; in Hawaii ceases to be
the term used solely for the social, legal, economic and spiritual
bonding of a man and a woman, the term &quot;marriage&quot; becomes
useless.

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

A key point to remember is that no one of marriageable age
is prevented from marrying in Hawaii provided they don't marry
blood relatives, underage persons, nonhumans or more than one
person.  Homosexuals are not denied the right to marry; but they
have to fulfill the requirements like anyone else.  They cannot
call a same-sex relationship &quot;marriage,&quot; since it lacks
a basic ingredient -- an entire sex.  The joining of the two opposite
sexes in permanence is the very essence of marriage.  Once the
&quot;one man, one woman&quot; definition is abandoned, there
is no logical reason for limiting &quot;marriage&quot; to two
people or even to people.  Why not have three partners?  Or why
not a man and his daughter?  Or a man and his dog?  The logical
reason to extend &quot;marriage&quot; to homosexual couples has
nothing to do with marital integrity, but only reflects the fact
that homosexuals want the same status regardless of its real meaning.
Anything less, they say, is a denial of human rights.  If so,
then a threesome or a foursome seeking marital status can similarly
claim that their sexual proclivities must be recognized by society
and the law as the equal of marriage or they are facing discrimination.

<p>

<center><h3>The Real Agenda</h3></center>

<p>

Homosexual activist Tom Stoddard acknowledges that &quot;enlarging
the concept to embrace same-sex couples would necessarily transform
it into something new....Extending the right to marry to gay people
-- that is, abolishing the traditional gender requirements of
marriage -- can be one of the means, perhaps the principal one,
through which the institution divests itself of the sexist trappings
of the past.&quot;[21] In other words, while many homosexual spokesmen
say they want only to be left alone to enjoy the benefits of marriage,
Stoddard rightly sees the expanded definition as a way of attacking
the institution itself.

<p>

In 1992, organizers of the homosexuals' 1993 March on Washington
met in Texas to draft a platform of demands.  Known as &quot;the
Texas platform,&quot; it was later toned down to make it more
palatable to a mass audience.  The original section on &quot;family,&quot;
however, is revealing as to the intentions of the movement.  In
addition to Demand No. 40, &quot;the recognition and legal protection
of all forms of family structures,&quot; the writers make Demand
No. 45, &quot;legalization of same-sex marriages,&quot; and Demand
No. 46, &quot;legalization of multiple partner unions.&quot;[22]

An English study also published<br>
in the journal</i> AIDS <i>found that<br>
most 'unsafe' sex acts occur in<br>
steady relationships.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

An enormous body of research indicates that monogamy is not the
norm for the average homosexual.[23] But even when it is, the result
is not necessarily healthier behavior.  A study published in the
journal <I>AIDS</I> found that men in steady relationships practiced
more anal intercourse and oral-anal intercourse than those without
a steady partner.[24] In other words, the exclusivity of the relationship
did not diminish the incidence of unhealthy behavior that is the
essence of homosexual sexual activity.  Curbing promiscuity would
help curb the spread of AIDS and the many other sexually transmitted
diseases that are found disproportionately among homosexuals,
but there is little evidence that &quot;monogamous&quot; homosexual
relationships function that way.  An English study also published
in the journal <I>AIDS</I> found that most &quot;unsafe&quot;
sex acts occur in steady relationships.[25]

<p>

Former homosexual William Aaron explains why &quot;monogamy&quot;
has a different meaning among homosexuals:  &quot;In the gay life,
fidelity is almost impossible.  Since part of the compulsion of
homosexuality seems to be a need on the part of the homophile
to 'absorb' masculinity from his sexual partners, he must be constantly
on the lookout for [new partners].  Consequently the most successful
homophile 'marriages' are those where there is an arrangement
between the two to have affairs on the side while maintaining
the semblance of permanence in their living arrangement.&quot;[26]

<p>

<center><h3>Sexual Revolution: A War on Families</h3></center>

<p>

As the research of the late Harvard sociologist Pitirim Sorokin
reveals, no society has loosened sexual morality outside of marriage
and survived.  Analyzing studies of cultures spanning several
thousand years on several continents, Sorokin found that virtually
all political revolutions that brought about societal collapse
were preceded by sexual revolutions in which marriage and family
were no longer accorded premiere status.[27] To put it another way,
as marriage and family ties disintegrated, the social restraints
learned in families also disintegrated. Societal chaos ushers
in tyrants who promise to restore order by any means.

<p>

Self-governing people require a robust culture founded on
marriage and family, which nurture the qualities that permit self-rule:
deferred gratification, self-sacrifice, respect for kinship and
law, and property rights.  These qualities are founded upon sexual
restraint, which permits people to pursue long-term interests,
such as procreating and raising the next generation, and securing
benefits for one's children.

<p>

In the 1981 Apostolic Exhortation <I>Familiaris Consortio</I>,
John Paul II summarized the importance of marriage-based families
this way:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;The family has vital and organic links with society since
it is its foundation and nourishes it continually through its
role of service to life:  It is from the family that citizens
come to birth and it is within the family that they find the first
school of the social virtues that are the animating principle
of the existence and development of society itself.&quot;</i>[28]

</blockquote><p>

According sex outside marriage the same protections and status
as the marital bond would destroy traditional sexual morality,
not expand it.  One can no more &quot;expand&quot; a definition
or moral principle than one can continually expand a yardstick
and still use it as a reliable measure.[29]

<p>

Marriage-based kinship is essential to stability and continuity.
A man is more apt to sacrifice himself to help a son-in-law than
some unrelated man (or woman) living with his daughter. Kinship
entails mutual obligations and a commitment to the future of the
community. Homosexual relationships are a negation of the ties
that bind -- the continuation of kinship through procreation of
children.  To accord same-sex relationships the same status as
a marriage is to accord them a value that they cannot possibly
have.  Marriages benefit more than the two people involved, or
even the children that are created.  Their influence reaches children

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>

Some people in Hawaii are beginning the process of fashioning
a constitutional amendment to protect their state's law on marriage,
should the courts radically redefine it.  Other states are taking
action to defend their laws regarding marriage.   If more states
strengthen their laws, they would also strengthen the marriage
defenders in Hawaii, who can cite the &quot;compelling state interest&quot;
of heading off a constitutional crisis. At the federal level,
Congress may well consider legislation mandating the one-man,
one-woman definition of marriage for all federal purposes, including
the military, federal benefits, federal agency employment policies,
and the law in federal territories such as Puerto Rico and Guam.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Both the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China on Taiwan (ROC) have applied to join the World Trade Organization (WTO), the multilateral organization that sets the rules for international trade. Taiwan has made substantial progress in its accession negotiations. Although several important economic issues remain, the most significant obstacle to Taiwan's membership in the WTO is not economic, but political. China insists that Taiwan should not join the WTO before China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. prefers that China and Taiwan become members of the WTO simultaneously. Simultaneous accession is, of course, the best possible outcome, but China is not as far along as Taiwan in meeting the criteria for membership. The U.S. should not let China's political sensitivities over Taiwan's membership slow U.S. negotiations with Taiwan. Once Taiwan meets the requisite economic criteria for WTO accession, the U.S. should be prepared to exercise international leadership to support Taiwan's membership, even in the face of China's determined opposition. Indeed, a clear signal to Taipei that the U.S. is willing to exercise such leadership could encourage Taiwan to meet the economic criteria for membership. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. also needs to clarify its position toward the PRC's prospective membership in the WTO. China wants to join for economic and political reasons. It wants not only the benefits of trade, but also the political recognition of its status as a world economic power and its primacy over Taiwan. In contrast, the European Union (EU), Japan, and the United States insist that WTO membership is a commercial contract, not an act of political recognition.<sup>1</sup>  Along with the Europeans and the Japanese, the Clinton Administration correctly insists that China can join the WTO only on "commercially viable terms."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Substantial disagreements remain over the terms of China's accession. In particular, China disagrees with the EU, Japan, and the U.S. on the size and scope of tariff reductions; when China's export-import licensing scheme, known as trading rights, should be abolished; how China's investment and industrial policies should be brought in line with international agreements; whether China should accede to the WTO as a developed or developing country; and what safeguards should be available to limit import surges while the WTO accession agreement is being implemented.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
China's desire to join the WTO is an opportunity for the U.S. In addition to ensuring that China meets certain economic standards before acceding to the WTO, the U.S. could offer Beijing permanent, unconditional most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status in exchange not only for economic concessions, but also for dropping its political demands on Taiwan with regard to the WTO. It is in America's interest that membership in the WTO, both for China and for Taiwan, be treated as an economic question.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

To further American economic interests, President Bill Clinton should:
<p><ul>
<li> Support Taiwan's accession to the WTO after it meets U.S. demands on outstanding issues. Taiwan's accession should not be held hostage to demands by the PRC.
<p>
<li> Work closely with the European Union and Japan to ensure that China becomes a WTO member on commercially viable terms. In the face of a unified position on the part of the world's major trading nations, Beijing will be more likely to make economic concessions.
<p>
<li> Offer to exempt China from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment in exchange for concessions. The President should ask Congress for discretionary authority to exempt China from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. Allowing the President to trade unconditional, permanent MFN status, which Beijing would value highly, for concessions on Taiwan's membership in the WTO and on economic issues benefitting the U.S.would increase America's negotiating leverage with China.

</ul><p>
<b>FROM GATT TO THE WTO</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Both China and Taiwan want to join the World Trade Organization because membership facilitates trade and enhances economic growth. Superseding the General Agreement Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the WTO establishes the legal framework for international trade. It also is the international organization which administers such multilateral agreements as GATT, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The WTO requires that member states and territories adhere to certain trade rules. Each member must apply the same tariffs and trade regulations to goods and services from all other members. This is known as the most-favored-nation (MFN) principle.<sup>2</sup>  Moreover, members may not discriminate against imported goods in favor of "like" domestically made products. This is known as the national treatment principle. All WTO-related trade agreements are based on these two fundamental principles.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The World Trade Organization is a direct descendent of the International Trade Organization (ITO), which allied leaders attempted to create at the end of World War II. The ITO was intended to prevent a recurrence of protectionism and to set the rules for international trade in the post-war era. In 1946-1947, President Harry Truman negotiated an "interim" agreement, the GATT, with other countries to reduce tariffs and establish a legal framework for international trade.<sup>3</sup>  The GATT was not intended to be a permanent organization, but a temporary instrument of the ITO. However, because the U.S. Senate failed to ratify the ITO charter, the ITO died stillborn in 1950, leaving the GATT forced to function as the world's multilateral trade organization until the WTO was established on January 1, 1995.<sup>4</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Since 1947, there have been eight successful rounds of trade liberalization negotiations under the GATT. The eighth was launched in Punta del Este, Uruguay, in September 1986 and concluded in Marrakesh, Morocco, on April 15, 1994. U.S. legislation implementing the Uruguay Round was signed into law on December 8, 1994.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

As in previous rounds, the Uruguay Round achieved substantial tariff reductions in developed countries. It cut tariffs by 38 percent, dropped the average tariff to 3.9 percent, and eliminated some tariffs altogether.<sup>5</sup>  The Uruguay Round also broke new ground in a number of areas:
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Agriculture.</b> For the first time, trade in agricultural products was placed under the GATT. The Uruguay Round mandates the conversion of non-tariff barriers on agricultural products into tariffs. This means that import quotas on foodstuffs must be lifted and replaced by tariffs whose rates are set to allow at least the same volume of imports as under the quota. The Uruguay Round also reduces government financial support for agriculture by 20 percent and cuts the value of export subsidies by 36 percent and the volume of subsidized exports by 21 percent over six years.<sup>6</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Apparel and Textiles.</b> Import quotas on apparel and textiles manufactured in developing economies such as China or India are being phased out over 10 years.<sup>7</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Services.</b> Trade in such services as advertising and tourism is governed by a new General Agreement on Trade in Services, which establishes an MFN principle for all services. However, this agreement applies the national treatment principle only to those services listed by a WTO member in its trade liberalization commitments.  This agreement also mandates additional negotiations on opening markets in such service sectors as financial services, telecommunications, and maritime transport.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Trade-Related Investment Measures.</b> Modest progress was made toward liberalizing foreign investment. Regulations which require that a minimum percentage of a product's "added value" (i.e., that portion of its value normally subject to a value-added tax) be produced within a country are banned. Such regulations are known as local content requirements. Also banned are regulations which require that a minimum percentage of finished goods be exported in exchange for allowing imports.<sup>8</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Intellectual Property Rights. </b>Finally, the Uruguay Round establishes global rules for the protection of copyrights, trademarks, industrial designs, trade secrets, semiconductor layouts, and geographical indications.<sup>9</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

During the Uruguay Round, GATT members recognized the need for a permanent multilateral organization similar to the stillborn ITO to supervise global trade. As a result, the World Trade Organization, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, was established to supersede the GATT. The WTO oversees the implementation of trade agreements negotiated under auspices of the GATT or WTO, periodically evaluates the trade practices of its members, organizes future multilateral trade negotiations, and adjudicates trade disputes arising from WTO-related trade agreements.
<p>
<b>HOW TO JOIN THE WTO</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

A knowledge of the WTO's structure and procedure helps explain the difficulties facing Taiwan. The WTO is governed by a Ministerial Conference, which is composed of the trade ministers of all WTO members and must meet at least once every two years. Between meetings, the Ministerial Conference delegates the power to run the WTO to a General Council composed of representatives of all WTO members and a Director-General appointed by the Ministerial Conference.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Article IX of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization states, "The WTO shall continue the practice of decision-making by consensus followed under GATT.... [W]here a decision cannot be arrived at by consensus, the matter shall be decided by voting."  The preference for consensus is very strong. Fewer than a handful of votes have been taken in almost 50 years. When a vote does occur, each WTO member has one vote.<sup>10</sup>  Accession of new members requires a two-thirds vote of the membership. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Article XII of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization provides that a member may be either "a [sovereign] state or a separate customs territory possessing full autonomy in the conduct of its external commercial relations."  A state or territory applying for membership must submit a memorandum detailing all of its laws, regulations, and policies affecting trade and investment. Once this memorandum is submitted, negotiations for entry start on two tracks. In Geneva, the General Council appoints a Working Party composed of trade negotiators from WTO members, including the U.S., to bargain with the applicant on bringing its domestic laws into line with WTO rules. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Simultaneously, the applicant begins bilateral discussions with individual WTO members on tariff reductions and other market-opening issues. Only after the applicant concludes all bilateral negotiations may the Working Party submit a Protocol of Accession to the Ministerial Conference for approval. The Protocol of Accession is a statement which details all of an applicant's trade liberalization commitments. Consequently, the bilateral negotiations are a choke point in the membership process; any member can veto an applicant simply by failing to conclude the bilateral talks.
<p>
<b>TAIWAN'S BID TO JOIN THE WTO</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Because GATT and its successor, the WTO, allow either sovereign states or autonomous customs territories to apply, Taiwan applied on January 1, 1990, to become a contracting party to the GATT as "The Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu," or "Chinese Taipei."  This lengthy designation was chosen to soothe Beijing's sensitivities about Taiwan, over which it claims sovereignty.<sup>11</sup>  Taiwan was following the example of Hong Kong, which became a contracting party on April 23, 1986. On September 29, 1992, the GATT accepted Taiwan's application and appointed a Working Party to begin membership negotiations.<sup>12</sup>  Since then, Taiwan has participated in eight Working Party sessions and has conducted bilateral negotiations over tariff reductions and market access with 25 WTO members.<sup>13</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

China does not object to "Chinese Taipei's" accession to the WTO, provided it does not join before China. In fact, China has offered to sponsor Taiwan's membership as its first act as a WTO member; at the same time, however, because China considers accession to be a political act, it has warned WTO members that it will firmly oppose admitting Taiwan first. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Both bilateral and Working Party negotiations with Taiwan have progressed farther than they have with the PRC. Taiwan has agreed to enter the WTO as a developed economy, meaning it would comply with the same standards as the European Union, Japan, and the U.S.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Taiwan has promised to implement all WTO commitments immediately and fully with only a few exceptions, related principally to agricultural products. Taiwan has offered not only to lift all import bans, but also to cut average industrial tariffs from 5.2 percent to 3.8 percent and average agricultural tariffs from 13.3 percent to 11.4 percent. It also has agreed not to raise tariff rates in the future without compensating other WTO members; such compensation may include lowering other tariff rates, removing non-tariff barriers, or liberalizing trade in service sectors.<sup>14</sup> 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

However, five important economic issues remain unresolved in the bilateral negotiations with Taiwan.
<p><ul>
<li> Market Access for Alcohol and Tobacco. The Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau currently maintains a legal monopoly on the manufacture and distribution of alcoholic beverages and tobacco in Taiwan. The European Union and the U.S. are seeking to end the monopoly's discriminatory practices and expand export opportunities.
<P>
<li> Market Access for Agricultural Products. Australia, the European Union, New Zealand, and the U.S. are not satisfied with Taiwan's offer to reduce tariffs and liberalize quotas for agricultural products, especially beef, milk, rice, and various fruits and vegetables.
<p>
<li> Market Access for Motor Vehicles. Japan, South Korea, and the U.S. have yet to reach agreement with Taiwan on cutting tariffs and removing strict quotas on automobile imports.
<p>
<li> Intellectual Property Rights Protection. The European Union and the U.S. find that Taiwan does not sufficiently protect intellectual property rights. Taiwan still requests a two-year phase-in period for implementing the Uruguay Round Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights, while American and European negotiators insist on full implementation immediately upon accession. Taiwan also has failed to meet the American and European demand for full protection of copyrighted materials produced in the last 50 years.
<p>
<li> Market Access for Services. Taiwan's proposal on such services as telecommunications and legal services is also inadequate for the U.S. For example, American negotiators want to remove Taiwan's suffocating restrictions on foreign investment in the telecommunications industry.<sup>15</sup>
</ul><P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

During the December 1995 meeting of the Taiwan Working Party, U.S. negotiators handed their Taiwanese counterparts a discussion paper on these unresolved issues. Taiwan is expected to reply before the Working Party's next meeting, tentatively scheduled for late spring 1996.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The optimum outcome would be the simultaneous accession of China and Taiwan to the WTO. However, the slower pace of the negotiations with China may be affecting the pace of talks with Taiwan. Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord told a November 9, 1995, briefing at the Foreign Press Center that "we have not reached a point where we have to worry about sequence,"<sup>16</sup> but a more accurate (and perhaps more candid) statement of where things actually stand came from another American official. This official, who requested anonymity, commented after Taiwan's Working Party meeting on December 14, 1995, that "no one in the Working Party has the stomach" to propose delinking the accessions of the PRC and ROC.<sup>17</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

When the question of who should go first does come up, the Clinton Administration merely follows the crowd. As Lord noted, "[the sequence of accession] will be a collective decision of the WTO, not just the United States."  Lord went on to say that "we believe each case should be decided on its own merits" without "any political consideration."<sup>18</sup>  As a European official observed anonymously after the conclusion of the Working Group meeting on December 14, however, "Bilateral concerns with Taiwan should be easy to conclude, [but] the EU is not keen to conclude them because there is a clear sentiment among WTO members that Taiwan's accession cannot take place before China's."<sup>19</sup>  Thus, without determined American leadership, it is doubtful that Taiwan will be permitted to enter the WTO before the PRC. The WTO's consensus-based approach to decision-making gives China a tacit veto over Taiwan's accession.
<p>
<b>THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND THE WTO</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It will be more difficult for China to join the WTO than it is for Taiwan, if only because Beijing will have to make more fundamental changes in the structure of its economy.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
China is now the world's third-largest economy behind the U.S. and Japan. Since 1978, the People's Republic of China has transformed its once-stagnant command economy into a growing mixed economy. Markets have been liberalized, and prices are set largely by the market. While currency inconvertibility and poor statistical data make a precise determination of China's gross domestic product impossible, estimates of its 1994 GDP range from $474 billion to $3.0 trillion.<sup>20</sup>  China's annual real GDP growth rate has averaged more than 9 percent in the last decade.<sup>21</sup>  Furthermore, China's high savings rate, high degree of literacy, and low population growth rate suggest the ability to sustain high productivity and per capita income growth rates in the future.<sup>22</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Economic reform also has stimulated international trade. China's global two-way trade was $20.7 billion in 1978, making the PRC the world's 27th-largest trading economy. In 1994, with two-way trade of $236.4 billion, China became the world's tenth-largest trading economy. Two-way trade between China and the U.S. also has grown, rising from $4.8 billion in 1980 to $48.1 billion in 1994, making the PRC America's sixth-largest trading partner.<sup>23</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Coming to Geneva.</b> China has been seeking to join the GATT and now the WTO for almost a decade. Although the Republic of China was an original contracting party to the GATT in 1948, Taiwan's government withdrew in 1950, following the Communist victory on the mainland and the Nationalist retreat to Taiwan; later, once economic reforms were underway on the mainland, the PRC sought to resume the seat itself. China won observer status in the GATT in November 1982 and formally requested accession to the GATT on July 11, 1986. On February 13, 1987, China submitted the required memorandum describing its trading system, and on March 4, 1987, the GATT Council established a Working Party to negotiate China's accession.<sup>24</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, China launched a major campaign to join the GATT before the end of 1994. Beijing wanted to become a founding member of the WTO because it saw this as political recognition of China's status as a world economic power. The European Union, Japan, and the U.S. insisted that China's accession must be accomplished on "commercially viable terms."  Because negotiators were unable to bridge the wide gap between these two positions, the talks failed to produce an agreement on China's accession.<sup>25</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Almost one year later, on November 10, 1995, Deputy United States Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky laid out a secret 13-page "road map" on Chinese accession to Beijing negotiators. This document outlined the full range of WTO commitments and identified the basic issues that China must resolve before it can enter the WTO on a commercially viable basis.<sup>26</sup>  These issues include:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Reducing tariffs and opening markets.</b> A wide gap remains between China's current offers on reducing tariffs and the minimum demands of the major trading powers. During the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum Leaders' Meeting in Osaka, Japan, on November 19, 1995, Chinese President Jiang Zemin announced that China would cut its average tariff rate from 36 percent to 24 percent as a "downpayment" on APEC trade liberalization.<sup>27</sup>  China also has indicated a willingness to cut its average tariff rate to 17 percent within three years for industrial products and six years for agricultural products.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
China has not released detailed information on what the new tariffs would be. Therefore, it is difficult to know the exact value of this offer. However, China's average tariff rate, even after this second reduction, would remain high compared to other developing countries such as Brazil (14.3 percent) or Malaysia (9 percent). Moreover, China indicated not only a desire to maintain an industrial policy to protect "infant" industries, but also an unwillingness to liberalize foreign investment rules and import restrictions in the automotive and telecommunications sectors of its economy.<sup>29</sup> 
<P>
<li><b> Trading Rights.</b> China controls imports and exports through a licensing system known as trading rights, which requires companies to receive Beijing's approval for each of their imports or exports. Under the WTO, firms may import or export any product they wish unless that product falls under certain narrowly defined government exceptions. Eliminating trading rights is important because they allow China to negate the value of any tariff concession by refusing to grant import licenses.<sup>30</sup>  In December 1995, China offered to phase out trading rights within five years instead of the eight years it had offered in July 1995.<sup>31</sup>  The U.S. has pushed for a shorter phase-out, possibly two or three years, provided China does not favor domestic firms over their foreign rivals in granting trading rights during the phase-out period.<sup>32</sup>
<p>
<li><b> Investment and Industrial Policies.</b> China's investment and industrial policies violate GATT's national treatment principle. For example, China forbids foreign investment in some industries (such as motor vehicle assembly), requires local partners in others, and discriminates against foreign firms in granting trading rights. China also violates the Uruguay Round Agreement on Investment by requiring that foreign investors in China use domestic components in manufacturing of their products and also by requiring that foreign-owned firms export a large percentage of the products made at their Chinese factories. Finally, China violates the Uruguay Round Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights by requiring the transfer of patented technology as a precondition for approving foreign investment. The European Union, Japan, and the U.S. insist that China terminate these practices upon accession, but the Chinese want a much longer phase-out period.
<p>
<li><b> Developed versus Developing Country.</b> China seeks to enter the WTO as a so-called developing country. The WTO tries to help developing members adjust to global competition by allowing them to adhere to less demanding standards and to take a longer time to implement trade liberalization than is required of developed members. For example, in agriculture, while developed members must cut the value of their export subsidies by 36 percent and the volume of their subsidized exports by 21 percent over six years, developing members are allowed to reduce the value of their export subsidies by only 24 percent and the volume of their subsidized exports by 14 percent over ten years. Similarly, developed members must implement the Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights within one year, while developing members may take up to four years to implement the provisions.
<P>
China argues that it qualifies for admission as a developing country because of its low per capita income. The U.S. and other developed countries counter that China's economy is not small and weak like those of other developing countries; China is already a major exporter. Therefore, the PRC should enter the WTO under the more demanding standards of a developed country.
<P>
<li><b> Protection Against Import Surges from China.</b> The only significant disagreement among the European Union, Japan, and the U.S. concerning China's entry to the WTO is over safeguards against import surges from China during the phase-in period. WTO members may raise tariffs temporarily or impose quotas for up to four years (1) when an import surge threatens a domestic industry and (2) when relief from the import surge may "prevent or remedy serious injury and facilitate adjustment."  This practice is known as a "safeguard."  Generally, safeguards may not be targeted at a specific country; they must be applied equally to all exporting countries.
<P>
Europeans insist that during China's transition period, WTO members must be permitted to impose "safeguard" tariffs or quotas on Chinese exports without having to apply them at the same time to exports from all other WTO members. Furthermore, they want to be able to apply these safeguards against either specific Chinese products or all Chinese exports. The Japanese, on the other hand, have shown little interest in safeguards.
<P>
The American position is more ambivalent. The United States wants a strong accession agreement and would like to have China move rapidly to liberalize its market and adopt strict rules on investment and intellectual property rights. At the same time, the U.S. "road map" suggests a willingness to consider safeguards if necessary.
<P>
China objects to safeguards as a violation of the MFN principle but does not rule them out entirely. It would allow WTO members to invoke safeguards only when the volume of imports of a specific Chinese product grew substantially faster than the volume of imports of similar products from other countries.<sup>33</sup> 
<p>
<li><b> Import Quotas.</b> Referring to Poland's accession to the GATT in 1968 as a precedent, the U.S. "road map" suggests that China should consider adopting import quotas while implementing its WTO commitments.<sup>34</sup>  During Poland's accession negotiations, GATT members struggled over how to create trading opportunities between Poland's non-market economy and their market economies. To solve this problem, Poland agreed to increase its imports from GATT members by seven percent each year and to subject its exports to GATT members to special safeguards. These import quotas encouraged Polish central planners to permit more imports and to abandon some protectionist policies.<sup>35</sup>
<p>
China feels that import quotas are inappropriate during the implementation period. A Chinese negotiator recently stated that "China is in transit from a planned economy to a market economy. Today's China is totally different than Poland thirty years ago."<sup>36</sup>
<p>
<li><b> Jackson-Vanik.</b> The Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act complicates the U.S. discussions with China over WTO accession. Passed in 1975, this law requires the President to certify annually that countries with non-market economies are allowing free emigration. Congress may overturn the President's certification by passing a joint resolution. Jackson-Vanik was intended to increase the flow of Jewish emigrants from the former Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites to Israel and the U.S. However, following the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, Congress began to apply it to China by attempting to revoke China's MFN status.
<P>
The WTO requires that the U.S. grant China unconditional, permanent MFN trade status once it joins the WTO. By preventing this, Jackson-Vanik will force the U.S. to conduct separate negotiations with China to try to duplicate the terms of its WTO accession in a separate bilateral trade agreement. This reduces America's negotiating leverage, allowing China to offer less generous economic concessions to the U.S. in a parallel bilateral trade agreement than other countries would receive under the usual WTO accession agreement.<sup>37</sup>
</ul><P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Chinese Reactions to the U.S. Position.</b> Chinese negotiators greeted the U.S. "road map" as a "positive initiative," but they also warned that substantial differences remain unresolved. An informal meeting of the Working Party convened in Geneva on December 7-8, 1995, and China-U.S. bilateral talks were held the following day. Chinese negotiators agreed to reply to the "road map" by the next meeting of the Working Party on March 18, 1996.<sup>38</sup> 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

During a February 12, 1996, meeting with Deputy USTR Charlene Barshefsky, Vice Minister Sun Zhenyun delivered China's reaction. Sun reaffirmed that the "road map" was a positive step, but criticized parts of it for making what he claimed were demands that exceed what is required of other WTO members. Sun rejected a U.S. proposal for safeguards against surges of Chinese imports. He also opposed a U.S. suggestion for import targets. China is expected to respond to the other issues raised in the "road map" at the next Working Group meeting.<sup>39</sup> 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

So far, American, European, and Japanese negotiators have remained remarkably united in their talks with China. The three major trading powers have insisted that China may not join the WTO as a matter of political recognition; accession must occur on a "commercially viable basis."

<p>
<b>BRINGING CHINA AND TAIWAN INTO THE WTO</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It will take China longer to join the WTO than it will Taiwan. The PRC has to make fundamental structural changes in its economy to meet WTO standards. The economic concessions Taiwan must make, while significant, are more limited, affecting only certain sectors of its economy. Nevertheless, even if the Taiwanese government decides to make concessions, Beijing's determined opposition to Taiwan's accession before China's and the apparent U.S. willingness to accede to Beijing's desires will hold Taiwan's application hostage to China's wishes.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

WTO-related trade agreements are commercial contracts, and WTO accession is an economic, not a political, act. Any state or territory willing and able to meet the WTO's economic criteria should be free to join. As the world's largest exporter, the U.S. has an interest in seeing that arbitrary political criteria are not applied to WTO applicants. Therefore, to further American economic interests, President Clinton should:
<P><ul>
<li><b>Support the accession of Taiwan to the WTO after Taiwan meets U.S. demands on outstanding issues.</b> If China is making enough progress in the WTO negotiations, the Clinton Administration should help China and Taiwan join at the same time. This would be the best outcome for all parties. However, if the talks with China fail and accession appears unlikely in the near future, the Clinton Administration should support the accession of Taiwan on its own merits, even though this would face China's determined opposition. 
<p>
<li><b> Cooperate with the European Union and Japan to ensure that China becomes a WTO member on commercially viable terms.</b> Close cooperation among the European Union, Japan, and the United States will prevent China from playing one against the others in the accession negotiations. Therefore, cooperation will increase American leverage in negotiating with China. At a minimum, President Clinton must insist that China agree to: 
<p><ol>
<li><b> Implement</b> the principal WTO commitments, publish all trade regulations, and provide an open and fair legal process for adjudicating trade disputes immediately upon accession.
<p>
<li><b> Accept</b> strong safeguard provisions in exchange for a longer time to phase out trading rights and implement other WTO commitments.
<p>
<li><b> End</b> the PRC's practice of forcing foreign firms to transfer technology as a condition of doing business in China. China's market is so huge that Beijing has the leverage to force large industrial firms to surrender to this form of government-sponsored theft.
<p>
<li><b> Enforce</b> fully all existing bilateral trade agreements, especially the 1995 Intellectual Property Rights Memorandum of Understanding.
</ol><P>
<li><b> Offer to exempt China from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment in exchange for concessions.</b> The President should ask Congress for discretionary authority to exempt China from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. Beijing highly values gaining unconditional, permanent MFN trade status in the U.S. However, keeping China on conditional MFN status subject to annual renewal, as mandated by Jackson-Vanik, provides the U.S. with few benefits. By granting the President the discretionary authority to exempt China from Jackson-Vanik, Congress would strengthen substantially America's leverage in WTO accession talks with Beijing. The President then could offer Beijing unconditional, permanent MFN trade status in exchange not only for relaxing its political demands on Taiwan's membership in the WTO, but for economic concessions that benefit American exporters and investors.
</ul><P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Jackson-Vanik Amendment harms American interests in a number of ways. First, applying Jackson-Vanik to China is based on a faulty premise. The PRC is no longer a stagnant non-market economy. Rather, it is a growing mixed economy. Proponents of applying Jackson-Vanik ignore the economic reforms that have occurred in China since 1978.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, applying Jackson-Vanik to China is inappropriate. Jackson-Vanik was designed to encourage the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites to lift restrictions on Jewish emigration to Israel and the U.S. However, it is American immigration law, not Chinese emigration policy, that restricts the flow of Chinese emigrants. While millions of Chinese would willingly emigrate to the U.S., American immigration law limits the flow to approximately 25,000 annually. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Third, Jackson-Vanik's threat to withdraw MFN is at best ineffective and at worst counterproductive. MFN tariffs are not a special privilege granted to specific countries; they are the standard rates that the U.S. extends to all but a handful of small countries. Withdrawing MFN would compel the U.S. to apply Smoot-Hawley tariffs on Chinese exports. After the inevitable Chinese retaliation against American exports, there would be a virtual cessation of China-U.S. trade.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Finally, Jackson-Vanik weakens the U.S. bargaining position in the WTO accession talks with China. By preventing the U.S. from granting China unconditional, permanent MFN, it would force the U.S. to conclude a separate bilateral trade pact with Beijing, paralleling China's WTO accession agreement and allowing the PRC to offer the U.S. smaller tariff cuts and fewer market-opening measures than it would grant to other WTO members in its accession agreement.

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China are seeking to join the WTO, the former as a sovereign state and the latter as an autonomous customs territory. Although Taiwan is closer to the goal, both have yet to meet the economic criteria for membership. Taiwan sees WTO membership as a commercial contract, while the PRC regards it as an act of political recognition. Beijing therefore opposes Taiwan's accession before its own. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Because China's accession is more complicated, negotiations with China may take longer to complete than those with Taiwan. Taiwan's accession to the WTO could be held hostage to the process of internal change in China. Given the commercial nature of the WTO, this would be manifestly unfair. When Taiwan meets the economic criteria, the U.S. should be prepared to exercise leadership in building international consensus for its accession, even in the face of China's determined opposition. Taiwan should join the WTO when it is ready, not when Beijing says it can.

<li>There are several important exceptions to the most-favored-nation principle. Customs unions such as the European Union and free-trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are permissible exceptions to the MFN principle. Likewise, developed WTO members may abolish or reduce tariffs on certain industrial goods imported from least developed members. This is known as the generalized system of preferences (GSP). <p>
