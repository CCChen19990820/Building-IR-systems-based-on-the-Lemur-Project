<P align=center><B>from Adopted People . . .</B>

<P><I>"I just felt such a need to see someone I looked like, but I didn"t want to hurt anyone—AKA helped me realize that yearning was not only ok, but natural and healthy."</I>

<P><I>"When I was beginning to think about searching, it was so helpful to hear birth mothers at AKA talk about their feelings through the years about the children they had placed for adoption."</I>

<P><I>"Hearing prospective adoptive parents’ fears, experiences and emotions has helped me understand my own adoptive parents better."</I>

<P align="center"><B>from Birth Parents . . .</B>

<P><I>"Most birth parents deal with such a high level of judgement, it was wonderful to finally find a place of true acceptance at AKA."</I>

<P><I>"Being in the presence of adoptive parents that really wanted to hear what we thought started our own healing process."</I>

<P><I>"AKA provided a roadmap through the search and reunion part of my life...hearing the educational programs, getting the support from others helped me each step of the way."</I>


<P align="center"><B>from Adoptive Parents . . .</B>

<P><I>"We were overwhelmed with questions and fears when we started exploring adoption. The people at AKA helped us sort through the short- and long-term issues involved."</I>

<P><I>"We"ve relied on the people and books and tapes at AKA to help us handle what each new stage brings in raising our child through adoption."</I>

<P><I>"Hearing adult adoptees and birth parents talk has changed my life-helping me feel not so frightened, just more prepared for the future—and more validated as a parent."</I>


<P align="center"><b>from Professionals . . .</b>

<P><I>"The world of adoption is in dire need of education, we have leagues to go, both in working with triad members and our community at large."</I>

<P><I>"Each time I attend an AKA meeting, I"m wishing my colleagues were also gaining the awareness of just how profound these issues are for each party touched by adoption."</I>

<P><I>"I learned more in one day at your conference than in 5 years of social work experience!"

<H2>1996 AKA FALL CONFERENCE</H2>
Friday, Nov. 1,  10 am - 4 pm<br>
Saturday, Nov. 2,  9 am - 4:30 pm<br>
Austin, Texas

</center>

<H3>SPEAKERS/TOPICS____________________________________</H3>

<P>AKA's 5th annual Fall Conference brings to Texas three nationally-known speakers with an exceptional depth of personal and professional adoption experience.

<P><B>FRIDAY, NOV. 1 PROFESSIONAL’S CLINIC</B> is geared for clinicians, attorneys, school counselors, etc. working with those touched by adoption as well as interested birth and adoptive families. 

<P><B>Joyce Maguire Pavao, Ed.D., LCSW, LMFT</B> is the founder and director of The Center for Family Connections, the Pre/Post Adoption Consulting Team and the Adoption Resource Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 

<P>Join Dr. Pavao on Friday as she discusses "Normative Crises in the Development of the Adoptive Family" - a framework she uses to recog-nize the special concerns affecting triad members as normal under the circumstances that adoption creates. Rather than seeing these issues that arise as negative or pathological, Dr. Pavao brings her training in family and systems theory to focus on understanding predictable developmental phases that most adoptive families and birth parents encounter. She believes viewing these crises as difficult times that should be expected provides an effective approach for helping individuals and families move toward healthy resolution and relationships.

<P>The latter part of the day will include a look at adoption from a clinical perspective, challenging profes-sionals to see what kind of boundary profile (counter-transference) issues might be helpful and/or harmful for the clients involved. Several cases will be presented.


<P><B>SATURDAY, NOV. 2, TRIAD & PROFESSIONAL’S DAY</B> features two additional outstanding speakers, Jan Waldron and Patricia Martinez Dorner, M.A., L.P.C., plus workshops sure to be enriching.

<P> Jan Waldron is the author of Giving Away Simone, her stunning memoir that has gained much national attention for its deeply personal and thought-provoking account of a birth mother’s experience and wisdom. Patricia Dorner, Director of Adoption Counseling and Search of San Antonio, and one of the country’s leaders in adoption reform, is the author of Talking to Your Child About Adoption and co-author of Children of Open Adoption. 

<P>Dr. Pavao will begin the day with "Identity Issues in the Adoption System" - a topic of utmost relevance to adopted people, birth families, adoptive families, and professionals. Continuing the morning session, Pavao, Dorner and Waldron will share their personal perspectives as triad members themselves (Pavao is an adopted person, Dorner an adoptive parent and Waldron a birth parent).

<P>The afternoon will feature Jan Waldron with "True Stories" followed by a choice of breakout sessions on "International Adoption," "The Many Faces of Adoptive Parenting" and "Reality and Reunions."

<H3>ADVANCE PRAISE_________________________________________</H3>

<center>
<p><I>"Joyce Pavao is extraordinary in her clinical perspective 
on adoption. I haven’t heard anyone like her in my seventeen years in the adoption field." </I><BR>
- Janie Cravens, Adoption Development Resources and AKA Board member 
 
<p><I>"I happened to hear Jan Waldron interviewed on National Public Radio one afternoon and was mesmerized as I battled the traffic.  I was lucky enough to hear her speak at a conference last year in Dallas and found her story and prose remarkable. 
She is an eloquent speaker who doesn't cast blame."  </I><BR>

-Benita Rubinett, therapist and AKA Board member

<p><I>"Dr. Pavao is gifted in her ability to relate to all members 
of the adoption triad.  Her personal experience and professional wisdom is communicated through her powerful, insightful and instructive presentation." </I><br>

- Katherine Williams, AKA Treasurer and triad member


<p><I>"As an author, a speaker and counselor, Patricia Dorner is a compelling voice for enlightened and reasoned thought in adoption. She is one of the gleeming minds, envisioning adoption that is ethical, humane and open.  I've heard her speak many times in many years.  Every time I've listened to her, whether at a podium or over lunch, I’ve learned from her."  </I><BR>
-Jim Rockwell, AKA founding member and triad member<p>

<p>
Observing objects beyond the Earth's atmosphere obviously depends
on whether it's clear or cloudy.  In many cases, though, it also
depends on the general atmospheric conditions above your location.
Here are some resources to help you determine how good the "seeing"
is going to be tonight.

Current Time And Position Information
</h3>
</a>

<p>
What you can see in a clear sky above you depends on when you look
and from what position on the Earth's surface.  In most cases, you
won't need precise measurements, but for those times that you do,
here are some resources to help you determine what time it is and
where you are.  Note, the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) is
the official timeskeeper in the United States, and the United States
Geological Survey (USGS) is the official determiner of positions in
the United States.  We've also included links to general resources for
learning more about the science of precisely determining time and position.

<h3>
Observing Equipment And Techniques
</h3>
</a>

<p>
An amateur astronomer's fundamental observing equipment is the eye.
Naked eye observing of the sky is simple, inexpensive, and immensely
rewarding.  But the unaided human eye is limited in what it can see.
Observing instruments such as binoculars and telescopes extend the
eye's capabilities, while imposing limitations of their own.  Here
are some resources to help you sort through the myriad possibilities
to find the right tools and techniques for the types of observing you
want to do.

<h3>
Earth-Orbiting Satellites And Near-Earth Objects
</h3>
</a>

<p>
Many of the objects orbiting our Earth are visible to observers on the
ground.  These objects include NASA's Space Shuttle during a mission,
Russia's Space Station Mir, a variety of operational satellites, and
even orbital debris, such as spent rocket boosters.  Some of these
objects appear as steady points of light moving in a slow arc across
the sky.  Other objects appear to "flash" as they move across the sky.
Lucky observers occasionally get to see the atmospheric reentry of
an object -- truly a spectacular sight!  However, the (re)entry and
impact of a large object could be disastrous.  So some astronomers
keep a close watchful eye on potentially threatening objects.

<h3>
Human Space Flight
</h3>
</a>

<p>
Since Yuri Gagarin's inaugaral human flight into space on 12 April 1961
aboard Vostok 1, the prospect of personally exploring our solar system
and beyond has thrilled and inspired hundreds of millions of passengers
on Spaceship Earth.  For those who were alive on 20 July 1969, the
landing of <i>Eagle</i>, and Neil Armstrong's first human step upon our
Moon, was a tremendously emotional capstone to the excitement that had
built throughout the 1960s.  Sadly, general public interest has steadily
waned since then, seeming to resurge only for events like the
near-disaster of Apollo 13 in mid-April 1970 and the tragedy of
<i>Challenger</i> on 28 January 1986.  But human space flight has
continued, and with projects like the near-future International Space
Station and the farther-future human mission to Mars, we are still
reaching outward.

Human space flight may be thrilling, as well as necessary to accomplish

platforms have repaid their cost many times over with extremely valuable
information about the solar system in which we live.  The list below is

History Of Astronomy
</h3>
</a>

<p>
Astronomy is the oldest known quantitative, empirical science.  Bone
artifacts dated to 36,000 B.C. -- 38 <i>thousand</i> years ago! -- 
carry markings that appear to count days between major lunar phases.
From about 4500 B.C. onward, the archeological evidence of astronomical
knowlege is irrefutable.  The importance of astronomy to the development
of agriculture, navigation, mathematics, and all other sciences, as well
as religion and society in general, cannot be overstated.  Quite simply,
without astronomy, we would not be who we are today.

</ul>
</p>

<p>
The Austin Astronomical Society (AAS) holds monthly meetings, on
the second Friday of each month, on the University of Texas at
Austin campus, beginning at 7:30 PM.  Our meetings generally
consist of a short business session, followed by a program
related to astronomy.  After the meeting, which usually adjorns
around 9:30 PM, many of our members and visitors continue
informally at a local pizza parlor.
</p>

<p>
Often, our speakers are researchers associated with the university's
Department of Astronomy or McDonald Observatory in west Texas.  Twice
a year, we hold "show and tell" programs, at which Society members
share their latest feats of observing, astrophotography, telescope
building, astronomical software development, or whatever strikes
their fancy.
</p>

<p>
Our monthly meetings are free and open to the public.  Come visit
us!  Our regular meeting room is in Ernest Cockrell, Jr. hall (ECJ),
room 1.202.  ECJ houses the Department of Civil and Architectural
Engineering.  It faces Robert L. Moore hall (RLM), which houses the
departments of Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy.  ECJ is located
on the south side of 26th Street, halfway between Speedway and San
Jacinto, just east of the pedestrian bridge overpass on 26th Street.
Next to the pedestrian bridge, at street level, is a set of concrete
steps leading up to ECJ entrances.  Our meeting room is just inside
the bank of glass doors halfway up these steps.  Parking is usually
not a problem at the university after 4:00 PM, when most reserved
spaces become available for public use.  There is a large parking
lot on the northwest corner of Speedway and 26th Street, as well as
parallel parking spaces along 26th Street and several smaller parking
lots nearby.
</p>

<a name="sessions">
<h3>

<a name="centex">
<h3>
Central Texas Star Party
</h3>
</a>

<p>
Twice each year, the Austin Astronomical Society (AAS) sponsors the
Central Texas Star Party at Pedernales Falls State Park.  The park
is located about 45 miles west of Austin off Highway 290 near
Johnson City, Texas.  The skies there are dark, and the site is in
a large open meadow, the "Corral", which offers minimal horizon
obstruction.  These weekend, dark-sky star parties are usually held
in spring and autumn.  The spring star party is scheduled for the
evenings of April 4-5, 1997.
</p>

<p>
The Central Texas Star Party is free and open to the public.  However,
the <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/">Texas Department of Parks
and Wildlife</a> charges fees for entry to the park and for camping.
To make a campsite reservation, telephone the State Parks Reservations
system at (512) 389-8900.
</p>

<a name="safari">
<h3>
Austin Nature Center Safari
</h3>
</a>

<p>
Each year, the Austin Astronomical Society (AAS) participates in
Safari.  This event is sponsored by the
<a href="http://www.tech.net/austin/b0000108.htm">Austin Nature Center</a>
and is usually scheduled on the last weekend in April.  Safari is an
adventure in nature for kids of all ages, with booths and activities
sponsored by organizations throughout the Austin area.  There is an
admissions charge, which benefits the Austin Nature Center.
</p>

<p>
Weather permitting, our booth at Safari usually features projections
of the sun through a telescope onto paper, where it may be viewed
safely.  We usually also set up a second telescope to view "astronomical
objects" and display a variety of interesting astronomy photos and other
materials.
</p>

<a name="family">
<h3>
Family Night Under The Stars
</h3>
</a>

<p>
Each year, the Austin Astronomical Society (AAS) co-sponsors Family
Astronomy Night in Dripping Springs, Texas, in cooperation with the
Lion's Club there.  This event is usually held on a Saturday evening
in mid to late summer.  The date varies, depending on the weather, the
date of New Moon, and other factors.  There is a small admissions charge,
which benefits the Lion's Club and the Society.
</p>

<p>
Dripping Springs is located about 30 miles west of Austin on Highway
290.  Being outside the light pollution of the metropolitan Austin area,
the skies in Dripping Springs are fairly dark -- dark enough to see the
Milky Way!  Society members bring their telescopes and large binoculars
and are on hand and eager to share their knowlege of the night sky.
</p>

<p>
The 1996 Family Astronomy Night was held on Saturday, July 13.  As
summer 1997 approaches, check these pages for information on next
year's event.
</p>

<a name="other">
<h3>
Other Activities
</h3>
</a>

<p>
In addition to the regularly scheduled activities described above.
the Austin Astronomical Society (AAS) holds special-event star
parties in cooperation with central Texas organizations.  During
the past year, we have held star parties at McKinney Falls State
Park, at LBJ Ranch, and at events organized by Motorola and Wild

<h3>
Introduction
</h3>
</a>

<p>
The Austin Astronomical Society (AAS) is a club for people who
are interested in any aspect of astronomy or the space sciences.
We exist to provide a forum for like-minded individuals to share
their love of the sky and their desire to explore it, both with
other club members and with the public.
</p>

<p>
We are located in Austin, Texas (USA).  Through informal ties
with the Department of Astronomy at The University of Texas at
Austin, our primary meeting and observing sites are on university
property in Austin.  However, we have begun a new project to build
an observatory, which will house several of the larger telescopes
owned by the Society.  Once completed, the
<a href="facility.html#observatory">Central Texas Observatory</a>
will allow us to expand and improve our public education efforts.
As part of this project, we have sought and received IRS approval
as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.  Donations to the Society
are tax-deductible.
</p>

<h3>
Introduction
</h3>
</a>

<p>
The Austin Astronomical Society was founded in August 1969 (a month
after the first manned lunar landing of Apollo 11) by Austin residents
and University of Texas students interested in astronomy and the space
sciences.  The AAS was not the first astronomical society in Austin; it
had at least two recent predecessors which were no longer active.  These
included the Capital City Astronomers in the 1950s, and the Forty Acres
Astronomy Club in the early 1960s.  The latter group may have been strictly
a University of Texas club, since the term "Forty Acres" is the informal
name of the main campus of the University of Texas at Austin.
</p>

<a name="1969-71">
<h3>
The Natural Science Center Era (1969-1971)
</h3>
</a>

<p>
Promoted and organized by its activist first president, James Wertz,
the AAS was initially sponsored by the Austin Parks and Recreation
Department.  The Society held its first meetings on the second Tuesday
of each month at the old Austin Natural Science Center, at 401 Deep Eddy
(adjacent to Deep Eddy pool).  The Society's objective was to organize
astronomical activities that would appeal to persons of all ages and
science backgrounds.  The initial size of the Society was about 50 members.
This size would not increase quickly, though there was a slow continuous
turnover in the membership itself.  From the very beginning, monthly meetings
and observing sessions were Society staples.
</p>

<p>
The earliest Society meetings reflected popular interest in the space
program fostered by the Apollo lunar flights.  They featured NASA films
like <i>Mariner IV</i>, and <i>Color Photography in Space</i>, and films
of current astronomical interest, such as <i>Optical Testing of the
McDonald 107-inch Reflector</i> and <i>What are Quasars?</i>.  From the
beginning, however, the Society found itself in a very envious position
among astronomical societies:  Proximity to the University of Texas with
its big astronomy department, one of the country's largest, provided a
huge reservoir of speakers on current research topics of every type.
The ever-changing combination of films, member presentations, and U.T.
speakers kept most Society meetings interesting, and got the Society
off to a good solid start.  The Society newsletter, the <b>Sidereal
Times</b>, also helped hold the Society together, and ultimately served
as a historical repository of Society activities.
</p>

<p>
The typical monthly observing session, somewhat inaccurately termed a "star
party", was described in a 1969 report by member Bill MacBeth as an activity
"at which members meet at a country site for a twilight picnic and evening
of observing with their own telescopes, many of which are homemade."  The
first Society observing sessions were held in the gravel parking lot of the
Park Springs Church, a small country church some 4 miles south of Manor, east
of Austin.  The site provided dark skies at a convenient distance from Austin,
but it was strictly an ad hoc substitute for a long-term observing site.
</p>

<p>
In addition to its regular monthly activities the Society also became
involved in other less frequent public outings.  The most prominent of
these, which continues today, was the Society's participation in Safari,
the Austin outdoor natural science fair held each spring at Zilker Park.
A report on the Society's first participation in Safari, in spring 1970,
was typical of many that have followed since:
<p>

<p>
<blockquote>
     "Activities included several telescopes set up for showing sunspots,
     movies shown in an Army quonset hut and various astronomical
     publications sold at the booth in the center of our exhibit.
     The movies were observed by 231 people Sat. and 392 people Sunday.
     Movies shown were <i>Apollo 11</i>, <i>Apollo 12</i>, and
     <i>Lunar Samples</i>.
     A total of 21 Star Charts and 3 Observer's Guides were sold."
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
In addition to Safari, the Society also began promoting astronomy to the
public with various activities.  For example, the December 1969 newsletter
reports that:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
     "The observing party at Hancock Center was a big success, as far
     as nonmember participation was concerned.  There were long lines
     waiting to look at the Moon and Saturn through one of the four
     telescopes brought by members."
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
These early activities were the beginning of a long tradition of public
educational outreach by the Society, which continues today.  Subsequent
activities have included countless observing sessions for schools, Scout
troops, the general public, and talks by Society members to other groups,
both in Austin and the surrounding area.
</p>

<p>
For Society members there were also other activities available.  Some
early members, led by Hoy J. Walls, were actively interested in telescope
making.  This led to a series of mirror-making and telescope-building
classes in the early 1970s.  At the same time, close ties were formed with
the University of Texas Astronomy Department due to the large number of
University of Texas students in the Society (so many in fact that during a
few early summers no meetings were held when those students were gone).
</p>

<p>
In August 1971 these two developments converged when Dr. Harlan Smith
of the U.T. Astronomy Department gave the Society permission to move its
observing site to the U.T. Bee Caves Research Center, a few miles southwest
of Austin on Bee Caves Road.  The site was informally referred to as the
"NIKE site" due to its original function as a NIKE missile site protecting
Bergstrom Air Force Base during the Cold War years of the early 1960s.
</p>

<p>
The Society was given custody of one of the large concrete missile pads,
as well as a small adjacent former guard house which provided heat and power.
In return, the Society agreed to provide telescopes and members to conduct
occasional observing sessions for U.T. undergraduate astronomy classes.  This
was considered a small price to pay for being handed such a choice observing
site.  The first of many Society observing sessions for U.T. students was held
the next spring, in March 1972.
</p>

<p>
Because the NIKE site provided a protected permanent environment, Society
interest immediately arose, especially among the telescope makers, in placing
a large, permanent instrument there.  Consequently, August 1971 also marked
the first meeting of a committee to design and build a telescope to be located
permanently at the NIKE site.  The design ultimately chosen was a 12.5-inch
Newtonian reflector, to sit on a concrete pier under a roll-off shelter on
tracks.  Design and fabrication of the instrument began quickly, aided both
by the knowlegeable telescope builders, and by Society members who were U.T.
engineering majors with access to U.T. student machine shops.
</p>

<a name="1972-81">
<h3>
The Farm & Home Savings Era (1972-1981)
</h3>
</a>

<p>
By 1972 the Society had grown a bit to 60 members, and interest arose in
finding an alternate meeting place.  The old Natural Science Center facility
was small, and meeting conditions were often less than ideal.  Consequently,
in November of 1972 the Society moved its meetings to the Farm & Home Savings
building.  This building was on the west side of Lavaca just south of 15th
Street in downtown Austin.  The new second floor meeting room was bright,
open and modern, providing a nice atmosphere for Society meetings.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, work on the new telescope had slowed down somewhat due to
design changes and disagreements, delays, and other complications.  Despite
this, work on both the telescope and the NIKE site continued throughout 1972,
leading to an initial test-installation of the new telescope at the NIKE site
in March 1973.  Following completion of the telesope and shelter, the formal
dedication of the telescope took place in January 1974 at the NIKE site,
where Dr. Harlan Smith gave an invited talk to the Society.  After its
dedication, the telescope and NIKE site became a focus of Society activities
for over two decades, hosting countless public and private observing sessions.
The NIKE telescope has provided hundreds of people with their very first views
of the planets and the deep-sky wonders beyond, thereby paying back many times
over the effort invested by the Society to build it.
</p>

<p>
The decade of the 1970s was a busy one for Society members quite apart
from work on the telescope and the move to new quarters.  In the early 1970s,
close ties with the U.T. Astronomy Department led to many joint observing
expeditions to observe "grazing occultations" of the Moon by bright stars,
under the leadership of Dr. David Dunham of U.T..  The purpose of a graze
trip was to precisely time the on-off blinks of a star as it grazed the Moon,
passing in and out behind mountains.  Such timing information could help
refine both the position of the Moon and that of the star.  In addition,
it occasionally led to the discovery of close stellar companions.  The typical
graze trip involved setting up a line of as many as a dozen observers with
their telescopes in a direction perpendicular to the predicted graze path.
Distances between stations were typically several hundred yards.  When the
event occurred observers at one end of the line might see no occultation at
all, while those at the other end might see only a simple occultation (one
disappearance and reappearance).  With any luck, those in between could time
a whole series of occultations, which when assembled later, would provide an
exagerated profile of the lunar mountains and valleys through which the star
had passed.  Usually these events lasted from a few seconds to a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
Under Dr. Dunham's energetic leadership, dozens of such graze expeditions
were undertaken by Society members in the central Texas area during the
1970s.  Because the observing lines were typically set up along back
country roads, they were occasionally the focus of interest by local
residents, including law enforcement officers.  One sheriff, for example,
wanted to know if the equipment was being set up to time a drag race.  This
author remembers being approached at his observing station by a suspicious
rancher just as a graze was starting, and spending the next ten minutes
explaining what a graze was and how interesting it was to observe, while the
event itself passed unrecorded.  But the rancher did walk away pleased after
a good look at the Moon.  Progress comes in small steps sometimes.
</p>

<p>
Not all such trips were limited to central Texas.  In December 1972, just
after the Society's move to Farm & Home Savings, Dr. Dunham drove a van load
of Society members and their equipment to Mexico City.  The purpose was to
link up with members of the Mexico City Astronomical Society to observe the
passage of the Moon through the Pleiades star cluster, early on the morning
of New Year's Day, 1973 in the Mexican desert south of Monterrey.  The long
trip went well, until a bank of clouds moved in just long enough to obscure
the actual event!  Never deterred, Dr. Dunham would lead yet another Society
group to observe an annular solar eclipse south of Acapulco a year later in
December 1973.
</p>

<p>
Plenty of other activities also kept Society members busy during the
1970s.  In January 1974, coincidental with the inauguration of the Society's
new telescope, the Society hosted public observing sessions of Comet Kohoutek
in conjunction with the U.T. Astronomy Department.  One of these sessions
was under a full moon on the LBJ Library lawn.  Later, in April 1974,
another long-standing Society tradition began with the first announcement of
an after-meeting pizza session at a nearby pizza parlor.  Although the site
of these convocations has changed periodically, this sacred tradition
continues today after most Society meetings.  Another Society activity, which
did not survive the 1970s, was an annual summer meeting/camping/observing
trip to Paleface Park on the northern shores of Lake Travis.  On these
outings, Society members would gather at the site on Saturday afternoons to
talk, swim, picnic, and spend the night observing on the shores of the lake,
returning home Sunday morning.  Increasing crowds, noise, and lights at the
park gradually reduced the appeal of this retreat, which ceased by the end
of the decade.
</p>

<p>
Numerous other highlights also marked the 1970s.  In August of 1975,
Society member George Haysler <i>almost</i> discovered Nova Cygni 1975 at the
NIKE site.  His discovery, as it turned out, was beaten only 10 hours earlier
by Japanese observers.  The year 1976 saw Society cooperation with the
Scouts, when both spring and fall observing sessions were hosted for the
Girl Scouts at one of their camps near Lake Travis.   In March of 1977 the
Society participated in the national observance of Astronomy Day with an
exhibit in conjunction with the U.T. Astronomy Department on the U.T. campus.
Later that year, in September, members trekked up to Waco for an evening's
observing with the 16-inch telescope at the observatory of Russell Smith.
The next month, October, saw the first episode of another a favorite periodic
Society activity: the first County Line BBQ dinner/star party.  Members would
gather at the County Line restaurant, on the road to the NIKE site, for a
Texas-sized BBQ meal, and then continue on to the site for a digestive
evening observing session.  Though not as frequently observed today, these
dinner/star parties were thoroughly satisfying gastro-astronomical experiences
for all who attended.
</p>

<p>
1978 began with one of the most unusual meetings ever held by the Society.
The January presentation was by Ray Stanford of Project Starlight
International, a central Texas group dedicated to responding to UFO sightings
and investigating the general UFO phenomenon.  With members about equally
split between those fascinated by the subject and utter disbelievers, the
meeting dynamics were truly something to be remembered.
</p>

<p>
September 1979 marked the 10-year anniversary of the Society's existence.
The September meeting featured Dr. Frank Bash from the University of Texas,
who spoke on star formation.  Perhaps appropriately, the September <b>Sidereal
Times</b> reported on the first annual Texas Star Party out at McDonald
Observatory in west Texas, organized by Society president Deborah Byrd.
The report noted that 75 people attended.  The Texas Star Party would
eventually evolve into one of the premier national star parties, and
control would revert to other organizations; but it was the Austin
Astronomical Society which initiated it in 1979.
</p>

<p>
1980, the end of the decade, marked a continuation of Society activities
that were by now well-established.  Several Society observing sessions were
held for U.T. student classes during the spring months.  During the summer,
more star parties for the Girl Scouts were held at Pace Bend Camp on Lake
Travis.  And the Society organized and hosted the second Texas Star Party
in west Texas on August 15-17.
</p>

<a name="1982-94">
<h3>
The Austin Community College Era (1982-1994)
</h3>
</a>

<p>
By 1981 Society membership had increased to around 70, and meeting place
problems were again brewing.  Farm & Home Savings wanted to convert its
meeting room for other uses, and so the Society was again obliged to look for
an alternate meeting facility.  A solution was provided by Dean Becker, a new
Society member and a teacher at Austin Community College (ACC).  Dean found
the Society a meeting room at the old Austin High School, now an ACC campus,
just west of downtown Austin.  The ACC meeting room would serve the Society
well for a dozen years, as it grew from 70 to about 100 members by its
25th anniversary in 1994.
</p>

<p>
One subtle aspect of this growth was the slow but sure transformation of the
Society from one very much dominated by U.T. students in the 1970s, to a true
city society.  This transformation was inevitable, since many of the founding
members, being students, eventually graduated and moved on to other parts of
the country.  Those that remained became a minority in a Society increasingly
dominated by enthusiastic members from Austin at large.  By the time of the
ACC move, this transformation was well under way.
</p>

<p>
The Austin Community College era brought another slow but sure change in
character to the increasingly city-oriented Society.  More activities
involved non-University events, and fewer requests came from U.T. for
support of student classes.  Connections with U.T. remained strong, however,
and the University continued to provide outstanding speakers at many of
the Society's meetings.  Perhaps the highlight of these presentations was
the April 1983 Society talk on cosmology by Nobel prize-winner Stephen
Weinberg, then at U.T..  Later, in 1988, the Society apparently decided to
drain the University of all current knowlege on quasars.  In the fall of
1988, three consecutive monthly presentations were given on quasars by U.T.
Astronomy Department faculty members.  Perhaps fittingly, there was not
another quasar talk given until the fall of 1995!
</p>

<p>
As before, star parties and public observing sessions continued.  In 1985
and 1986, the Society hosted public observing of Halley's Comet at McKinney
Falls State Park just southeast of Austin.  The events drew out the public
in large numbers, clogging the park entrance roads with vehicles.  In August
of 1989, the Society hosted a public lunar eclipse observing session in
Zilker Park, again producing ample crowds.  Although the weather cooperated
only grudgingly, the event was popular enough that it was covered on local
television news reports.
</p>

<p>
The Halley's Comet session at McKinney Falls State Park was the preamble
to what would become a longstanding Society relationship with the
Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife.  In April 1987 occurred the
first (recorded) McKinney Falls star party, an event co-sponsored by
Society members and park officials for the benefit of the public.  This
would be the first of many such public events at McKinney Falls, including
a special observing session for no less than comet Austin, in May of 1990.
Public sessions at McKinney Falls continue periodically today as time
permits, thanks to the energy and interest in public education of Society
members.
</p>

<p>
In a similar vein, and perhaps because of the success of the McKinney
Falls sessions, the Society decided to do a reprise of its 1979 launch
of the Texas Star Party by launching the spring edition of a "Central Texas
Star Party" at Pedernales Falls State Park (west of Austin) in April of 1991.
This was followed by a second Central Texas Star Party that fall, in November.
The Central Texas Star Party has since become a regular Society event,
attended not only by Austin Society members, but also by visitors from other
Texas astronomy societies and enthusiasts from outside the state.
</p>

<p>
November 1991, however, was tempered by the announcement of the death of
Dr. Harlan J. Smith, who had been one of the Society's key supporters at U.T..
As a tribute to Dr. Smith, the Society's 12.5-inch NIKE site telescope was
rededicated as the Harlan Smith Telescope, and a plaque noting the fact was
affixed to the telescope's concrete pier.  The dedication took place in May
1992 at a NIKE site ceremony with featured speakers Dr. Frank Bash, chairman
of the U.T. Astronomy Department, and Deborah Byrd, a past Society president
and (at the time) well-known producer of <i>Star Date</i>, a popular radio
program on astronomy.
</p>

<p>
In addition to hosting observing sessions, during this period Society
members embarked on occasional trips.  Among those noted in the <b>Sidereal
Times</b> were a 1987 Society trip to the Ft. Worth Museum of Science and
History, and a March 1990 group trip to the new George Observatory near
Houston.  Interest also returned to telescope making.  Society member
Larry Forrest, owner of the local optical company Glass Mountain Optics,
hosted a telescope-making class in the 1970s tradition of Hoy Walls.
Class accomplishments were proudly summarized and displayed at the
Society's August 1992 meeting.
</p>

<p>
1992 also signalled the start of another popular Society event.  In July
of that year the Society hosted the first "Family Astronomy Night" at the
small community of Dripping Springs, just west of Austin.  Over 500 people
attended this event, which has since remained an annual Society activity.
Also in 1992 the Society extended its public outreach efforts even further
afield in the state park system, with the "Night Sky Appreciation Program"
at the LBJ Ranch near Johnson City in October 1992, an event repeated in 1993.
</p>

<p>
By 1994, with the continuation of such events as Safari, the Central Texas
Star Party, the third annual Dripping Springs Family Astronomy Night, more
public programs at McKinney Falls State Park, and other educational outreach
activities, in addition to regular meetings and star parties, the Society
reached its 25th anniversary as busy as it had ever been.  The anniversary was
celebrated at the September meeting with a dinner at the Austin DoubleTree
Hotel and a retrospective review of the Society's first 25 years.  
</p>

<a name="1995-96">
<h3>
The Cockrell Hall Era (1995-present)
</h3>
</a>

<p>
By the Society's 1994 anniversary, membership had grown to some 100
members.  This growth, along with ACC's capacity-reducing renovations,
meant that the familiar ACC meeting room was beginning to reach its
limits.  So for the third time in its history the Society began a
search for a new meeting location.  This time, the Society's long-standing
good relations with the University of Texas paid a dividend.  The Society
obtained permission to meet in Cockrell Hall on the U.T. campus, where
regular meetings were moved in March of 1995.  The spacious lecture hall
in a relatively new U.T. building insured more than adequate space for
future Society growth.
</p>

<p>
But the Society had more than a meeting room change to consider.  The
venerable NIKE site observing location was steadily succumbing to Austin's
growth.  Observing had slowly deteriorated over the years, and conditions
were no longer considered adequate by the Society's more serious observers.
Discussions were held regarding acquisition of a new permanent observing
site, and interest began to focus on Pedernales Falls State Park west of
Austin.  The park is far enough from Austin to sport dark skies, but still
close enough to be usable on a semi-casual basis.
</p>

<p>
In the fall of 1995 these plans were given a sudden sense of urgency
when the Society learned it was the potential recipient of the donation
of a research grade telescope.  One requirement of this donation was
that the Society permanently house it and use it for public outreach
efforts in teaching astronomy.  The NIKE site was not considered a viable
site for such a telescope.  Consequently negotiations began in earnest with
Pedernales Falls park officials for procurement of a suitable site for a
permanent Society facility.  Because such a facility would be expensive,
efforts were also begun to obtain IRS status as a tax-free, non-profit
organization for the purpose of soliciting construction funds.  At year's
end, both these goals had been reached, and the Society was well on its
way toward a much improved new facility at Pedernales Falls.
</p>

<p>
Despite this major new project, the Society's normal itinerary of events
did not change in 1995.  Safari, the Central Texas Star Parties at Pedernales
Falls, McKinney Falls observing sessions, and regular meetings all continued
as usual, plus special events like the Motorola Star Party at the Barton Creek
Country Club, and a joint meeting with the San Antonio Astronomical Society
in San Marcos in November.  1996 thus found the Society busier than ever.
The Pedernales Falls facility, christened the
<a href="facility.html#observatory">Central Texas Observatory</a>, was
well under way as the Society continued its long tradition of public outreach.
</p>

<p>
Throughout all the changes in membership and meeting place, the Society's
focus remains remarkably constant, centered foremost on education in astronomy
and the space sciences.  As a result of Society activities, hundreds if not
thousands of central Texans have had their eyes opened to the wonders of
astronomy and the universe in which we live, certainly a bountiful harvest
from that first small meeting after the Apollo lunar landing of 1969.

Author's Note
</h3>
</a>

<p>
As a member of the AAS since 1970, it perhaps appropriately fell on
me to provide this brief history of the AAS.  However, it is impossible
for any one person to provide a truly unbiased view of the Society's past
existence.  I for example was much more active in the Society's early
years than I am now, and consequently I have been uninvolved in many recent
activities and Society projects.  As such, my rendition of recent Society
history probably suffers and may gloss over or omit entirely things that
should properly have been mentioned.  For that I apologize and invite
Society members to make this initial history a living document, amending it
and extending it in the future as time and inclination permit.  With a very
few exceptions, I have deliberately omitted many names I could have mentioned.
There have simply been far too many worthy contributing Society members to
attempt to mention them all in an abbreviated history like this, and so I
have decided to omit them altogether rather than offend some by mentioning
others.  The Society has been a truly remarkable social organism; I do hope
it survives to celebrate a 50th anniversary in good health in the year 2019.

<h3>
Bee Caves Research Center
</h3>
</a>

<p>
Through the generosity of The University of Texas at Austin's
Department of Astronomy, the Austin Astronomical Society (AAS)
has a permanent observing site at the Bee Caves Research Center
(BCRC), off Crystal Creek Drive in west Austin.  This facility
was originally built as a NIKE missile base to protect Bergstrom
Air Force Base.  The property is now owned and maintained by the
university.
</p>

<p>
The Society has the use of one of the concrete missile pads,
along with electrical power, at BCRC.  The site is elevated,
and despite ever-encroaching light pollution from growth in
the west Austin corridor, it still serves the Society well as
a convenient and suitable location for all but the most serious
observers.
</p>

<p>
The Society maintains a 12.5 inch Newtonian reflector telescope
at the BCRC site, housed in a movable shelter on tracks.  This
instrument, dedicated in 1992 as the Harlan Smith Telescope,
was designed and constructed by Society members.
</p>

<p>
The regular <a href="activity.html#sessions">monthly star parties</a>
of the Society are held at BCRC, using the 12.5 inch reflector and
many personally-owned telescopes brought and set up by Society members.
These star parties are free and open to the public.  However, due to
BCRC site security measures, assistance of a Society member is required
to gain access.
</p>

<p>
Society members also have use of the BCRC site at any time for
private observing sessions.  Society
<a href="members.html#dues-benefits">membership</a> is open to all
interested persons.

<h3>
Central Texas Observatory
</h3>
</a>

<p>
Over the past year or so, the Austin Astronomical Society (AAS) executive
council has been negotiating with the <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/">
Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife</a> to build an observatory within
Pedernales Falls State Park.  Due to changes in TDPW's upper management
during this period and related uncertainties within the department about
its future directions and priorities, we have been unable to conclude an
agreement with them.
</p>

<p>
The Society continues to favor Pedernales Falls State Park as the site for
the Central Texas Observatory, and we believe that by 1998, TPWD will have
dealt with its higher priority issues and will be ready to resume serious
negotiations with us.  However, we are eager to house and use the
<a href="http://www.wostx.com/AAS/ealing.html">16-inch Ealing Educator
telescope</a>, a research grade Cassegrain, which was donated to the
Society along with a 4-inch solar coronagraph.  We have therefore begun
discussing possible alternative observatory sites with the Lower Colorado
River Authority, Travis county commissioners, and Hays county commissioners.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.wostx.com/AAS/cto.html">observatory</a> will be
a sliding roof design, with two independently movable roof sections.  This
design allows a great deal of flexibility, to accomodate the variety of
public and private activities that it is expected to support.  Either
roof section may be moved to create a variable-size side viewing slit,
or both sections may be moved to create a variable-size central viewing
slit, or both sections may be moved to open the entire structure to the
sky.  Care has been taken to insure that even our smallest adult Society
members can manipulate the roof sections without assistance.
</p>

<p>
The design for the Central Texas Observatory has been completed and
transferred to blueprints, and a working scale model has been built.
We are now exploring alternative sites and we continue to seek additional
funds for construction from corporations, foundations, and individuals.
To date, we have raised over $14,000 or about one-third of the projected
construction cost.
</p>

<p>
Individual contributions in support of the Central Texas Observatory can
be made by purchasing <a href="planets.html">Planet Shares</a> or
<a href="stars.html">Constellation Shares</a>.  Share purchasers will
be honored on the walls of the observatory.  All donations to the Austin
Astronomical Society are tax deductible.

Miscellaneous
</h3>
</a>

<p>
In addition to the facilities and equipment described above, the Austin

<TITLE>Austin Community Nursery Schools (ACNS): History </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">

<CENTER><H1>History</H1></CENTER>

 ACNS began as the "Chalmers Nursery School" in the
Chalmers Courts housing project on East Third Street in November
1941.  A Works Progress Administration (WPA) Project, it was
sponsored by the Austin chapter of the American Association of
University Women (AAUW).  The Austin Independent School District
(AISD) was the legal sponsor. AAUW chose this project after a
community needs assessment revealed the need for low cost child
care services for children of working, low-income families. 
Chalmers Nursery School was the first child care center in the U.S.
located in a federal housing project.  Twenty-five children, ages
two through seven, were served. <P>

The agency began receiving regular support from the Community Chest
in 1944.  When federal funds ended in 1948, the agency was
chartered as a nonprofit corporation,  administration was turned
over to a volunteer Board of Directors, and the name, "Austin
Community Nursery Schools," was adopted.  In 1954, the Community
Chest was replaced by the United Fund (now the United Way/Capital
Area), and ACNS became one of the first eleven United Fund agencies
in the Austin area.  In the 1960's, two units within the
Meadowbrook Public Housing Project were used as the south school. 
In 1967, The Housing Authority of Austin constructed a small
facility across the street from the Meadowbrook Public Housing
project and ACNS-South continues to operate that facility today.  
Over the last four decades, teacher - child ratios have been
greatly improved, and educational activities have been . ACNS is
now recognized as a model program by the Austin Child Care
Council. <P>

<H3>Recent History</H3>

<UL>
<LI>On-site social workers, family support services, and health and nutrition programs were added in the 1970's. 
<LI>Annual funding increased and broadened through contracts with the Federal Child Care Food Program, State Child Care Management System (CCMS- formerly Title XX), City of Austin , and Travis County (through the Community Action Network -- CAN), and most recently HUD.
<LI>The ACNS Endowment Fund was established.
<LI>A part-time Educational Direc tor was hired in 1968; the position was expanded to full-time in 1991; then was vacated and frozen in 1994 due to decreases in state funding.  Through an innovative CAN funded Quality  Child Care Collaboration, the position of Education Director/Mentor Teacher is now shared among ACNS and three other child care nonprofits. 
<LI>ACNS centers became "Designated Vendors" with CCMS in 1991 meeting criteria above minimum standards as set by the Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services. Today, both ACNS schools are "Four Star" Designated Vendors (the highest rating given). 
<LI>In 1992, ACNS participated with 12 other agencies in the Texas Department of Human Services "Comprehensive Early Childhood Development Project."  The comprehensive and collaborative nature of the ACNS program was a determining factor in being chosen to receive the 18 month, $1 million grant. 
<LI>The position of Development Director was created in 1993. 
<LI> In 1994, the Bouldin Oaks Center was closed when the Austin Housing Authority revoked permission to use the facility.   All the children were successfully relocated to the South Center. 
<LI>In 1994, after unexpectedly losing its North site lease twice in seven years, ACNS purchased a facility in Northeast Austin on Forbes Drive.  The North Center relocated in August and the Business Office moved into the facility in November.
<LI>In 1995, the East Center was closed primarily due to changes and unpredictable decreases in CCMS funding.
<LI>In the Fall of 1996, ACNS was selected to provide the Therapeutic Child Care Componenet of the Center for Battered Women's new Supportive Housing Program. ACNS-Northeast is currently being expanded to serve 107 infants and young children. ACNS-South is targeted to create new classroom structures to accommodate other homeless children under this project. 
<LI>Today, both schools are accredited by the National Academy of Early Childhood Programs (NAECP), a division of the National Association for the Education of Young Children. 
</UL>

ACNS currently operates two centers:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
ACNS-South<BR>
1100 West Oak <BR>
serves 63 children ages twelve months through five years.   <P>

ACNS-Northeast<BR>
2217 Forbes Drive<BR>

</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">


<H1>Needs and Wish List</H1>

Support is especially needed this Fall and early 1997 as ACNS
maximizes the use of its Northeast school and opens a infant and
young toddler care which is so critically needed in the Austin
community. Institutional and child-proof equipment and supplies are
needed for the baby rooms and toddler classrooms; the kitchen
(including an institutional gas range and vented hood), ice
machines, etc.  Volunteer plumbers, carpenters, and others are also
encouraged to get involved.  Also need grant writers, consultants,
Board and committee members, and other individuals who desire to
support quality care for Austin's most needy infants and young
children. The Austin Association of University Women (AAUW) are
coordinating a Baby Shower in November. Call ACNS at 836-2229 for
more information. <P>

<TITLE>Austin Community Nursery Schools (ACNS): Problem Statement</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">



<H1>Problem Statement</H1>

There is a child care crisis in Austin and our Nation. Children need
and deserve quality care -- poor care has been proven to do harm.
However, affordable, accessible, quality child care is hard to find
and there are long waiting lists for subsidized or sliding scale
child care.  Many Austin children live in poverty, are subject to
abuse or neglect, or live in families experiencing major life
transitions and/or crisis.  The children are developmentally at-risk
in all aspects: physically, emotionally, socially and
intellectually. Poor families often lack the financial resources to
provide for their children's needs due to low wages and inadequate
benefits. Impoverished parents often are single and struggle daily
with a shortage of time, lack of positive parenting role models,
limited choices and options when attempting to solve problems, and
a lack of knowledge about and access to existing services.  For
working, low-income parents, child care options are limited.
Options a re even more limited for families in crisis or
transition, such a s those suffering from abuse in the home or
homelessness   Parents leave their children unsupervised or
supervised by siblings; rely on an ever- changing mix of friends,
family and neighbors to provide care; enroll their children in
unregulated, unlicensed care; or choose a center based solely on
ability to pay rather than quality of care provided. Inconsistent
child care makes it difficult for parents to work full-time and to
maintain continuous employments.  For children it can interrupt and
delay  the development of their physical, emotional, social and
intellectual skills. <P>

A study conducted by a University of Texas doctoral candidate
showed that the comprehensive program provided by ACNS makes a
difference in the subsequent academic achievement of at-risk
students.  In comparison to their elementary school classmates,
former ACNS students had better developed prerequisite skills for
math and language arts, including increased attention span, ability
to focus, listen, follow directions, and problem solve.
Additionally, parental involvement in the education of these
children was rated higher than that of their counterparts. <P>

Research from the Children's Defense Fund has shown that low income
children who participate in a high quality early childhood program
tend to stay in school longer, make more money as adults, are less
likely to be involved with the criminal justice system as youth and
adults, and are less likely to need special services.  Researchers
estimate that such programs return to the public seven dollars for
every dollar invested by saving the costs of remedial education,
social services, and criminal justice intervention. <P>

of funding for the census indices that we all use so frequently and wish
we had more of. The Head Librarian of the Texas State Library Genealogy
Collection makes these selections. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Book Acquisitions Fund:</B> This fund was established by the AGS to collect
donations from the membership at each meeting to fund the purchase of publications
that would not ordinarily be purchased by any other means. Clarice Neal
collects the money and selects the publications for purchase. <BR>

<H1>COMPOSTING</H1>
</center>


Compost is vegetable matter, such as grass clippings, leaves, peelings from
the kitchen, sawdust, animal manure (mostly made up of digested grass),
even shredded office paper, that has been allowed to decompose until it
forms a crumbly black substance called humus. You can use it as a
fertilizer, mulch, or soil conditioner. The greatest contribution compost
makes to the garden is by adding organic matter to the soil, which makes
soil easier to work and better able to hold the right amount of moisture
and nutrients.<p>

You may have heard that composting requires layering materials and
containing them it a bin. While some gardeners do use elaborate methods,
they aren't necessary. You can create compost by just heaping materials
into a pile and letting it decompose at its own pace (this approach is
called cold composting and takes about a year). You can speed up the
process by keeping the compost pile slightly damp and turning it with a
pitchfork or spade every week or so. This method is called hot composting
because the moisture and oxygen make decay microorganisms so active that
they produce heat. The temperatures in the pile can reach 160 degrees
Fahrenheit (hot enough to kill weed seeds and most disease pathogens).<p>

<H3>Feeding the Pile</H3>

Decay microorganisms have to balance nutrients in their bodies just as
people do. They usually can find plenty of carbon, which is abundant in
leaves, straw, sawdust, and shredded paper. They may run short on nitrogen.
You can improve the balance, and speed up decomposition, by adding
materials higher in nitrogen, such as fresh grass clippings, fresh manure,
alfalfa hay, and vegetable scraps. Or you can sprinkle the pile with
bloodmeal, which you can buy at garden centers.<p>

Avoid adding grease, meat scraps, and bones (these break down slowly and
may attract animal pests). Large leaves, twigs, and branches also break
down very slowly unless you shred them first. Unless you keep your compost
pile very hot (and most people don't), don't add weed plants that have gone
to seed or diseased plants, because you can transfer the problems to your
garden. Don't add animal or human feces, which can spread disease.<p>

<H3>Using Compost</H3>

How do you know when the compost is ready? If you want to improve the
soil's structure and ability to hold water and nutrients, let the organic
matter break down until most of it is unrecognizable. Then use a spade or
spading fork to turn a 2-3 inch layer of compost into the top 6-8 inches of
soil in new beds for vegetables, flowers, and shrubs. For lawns spread a
thin layer (up to an inch) on top of the grass in late fall or early
spring.<p>

If you want bulky material to use as a mulch, interrupt the decay cycle
earlier, while you can still identify some of the components. Because
undecayed organic matter causes a growth spurt among the soil
microorganisms, tying up some soil nutrients for awhile, it's best to put
on partially aged compost after the fall harvest, so it can cook down more
before spring. Apply a 1-3 inch layer on top of the soil around trees,
shrubs, and perennial flowers.<p>

<TITLE>Austin Organic Gardeners Club - COVER CROPS AND GREEN MANURES</TITLE>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" LINK="#00B000" VLINK="#7E7B7E" ALINK="#FF0000">

<H1>COVER CROPS AND GREEN MANURES</H1>
</center>


        
A green manure is a crop planted where you want to add organic matter to
the soil. You dig it into the soil and let the roots, stems, and leaves
decay there. A cover crop is a green manure intended to keep soil from
washing or blowing away before the main crop (vegetables, groundcovers,
lawn grass) fills in. <p>


Green manures add organic matter to the soil, choke out weeds, and protect
the soil from the eroding effects of wind and rain. Green manures take up
nutrients that might otherwise wash from bare soil, then slowly return them
to the soil as the plants decay. The roots loosen the soil and provide
additional organic matter. If you grow a legume as a green manure, it adds
nitrogen to the soil. <p>


You can plant a grass or legume as a green manure, or a mixture of both.
Grasses are better at adding organic matter and stimulating earthworms,
while legumes add more nitrogen. If you plant a legume, spread a
commercially available inoculant on the soil the first time you plat the
legume. The inoculant contains the nitrogen-fixing bacteria that live in
legume roots.<p>


When choosing a green manure, look for a plant that germinates easily in
your soil and grows quickly, covering the ground. Some manures are planted
in the fall and turned under in the spring, giving you organic matter
quickly. Others grow from spring to spring, giving long-term erosion
control.<p>


Green manures have drawbacks if you don't choose the crop wisely and manage
it. If you let a grass green manure grow until it becomes tough, it can
take a long time for soil organisms to break it down. You can get around
that problem by adding another source of nitrogen, such as bloodmeal, or by
growing the grass with a legume. If you plant seeds that can lie dormant in
the soil for a few years before germinating, or let a green manure go to
seed, you can create a new weed problem.<p>

<H3>Planting</H3>

To plant a green manure, rake the soil surface to break up clumps. You can
wait until you've harvested the existing crop, or sow it a few weeks before
the season ends, to protect the soil after harvest. Scatter the seed as
evenly as you can, then tamp the soil down. If you don't get rain while the
seeds are germinating, water lightly daily. As the seedlings get bigger,
water more deeply and less often.<p>

If you plan to leave the manure crop on through the summer, mow or cut it
each time it begins to flower, letting the clippings fall to the ground.
That way, it can't go to seed and create a weed problem.<p>


When you turn the manure under the soil depends on the results you want.
Grasses and other non-legumes add mostly nutrients if you turn them under
when they are young and tender. When they are older, they become a better
source of organic matter. Mature legumes add more nitrogen than young ones,
but can be harder to cut and turn under the soil.<p>


A few weeks before you plan to plant your garden, use a scythe or other
tool to chop the leaves and stems, or mow with a mulching mower. It will be
easier to work the manure into the soil if you first let it dry for a few
days. <p>


If you covered only a small area with a green manure, you can turn it under
with a spade. For a larger area, use a rototiller. Tough plants such as old
alfalfa may require a few passes.<p>


If you want to speed up the breakdown of the green manure, add animal
manure, compost, or another well-balanced organic fertilizer after turning
it under.<p>

<H3>GROWING GUIDE FOR COVER CROPS AND GREEN MANURES</H3>

<b>Annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.)</b><p>

Annual ryegrass dies out after one year, although some of the seed planted
the first year may come up for the next two or three. Use it when you need
a green manure that germinates quickly, loosens the soil, and prevents soil
erosion. Annual ryegrass won't tolerate flooded conditions for long. Annual
ryegrass germinates well in cool soils. It does well in a wide range of
soil pH and textures, but prefers loamy or sandy soils. Annual ryegrass
releases substances toxic to other plants. That trait makes it good for
weed control, but means you can't plant small-seeded crops such as lettuce
and radishes just after turning annual ryegrass under. Transplants and
large-seeded crops aren't affected.<BR>
<I>Growing Guidelines:</I> Plant in the fall. You can plant it along with a
legume. Scatter 1.5-3 ounces of seed per 100 square feet, or 1-2 pounds per
1000 square feet. Cover with about half an inch of soil, then tamp down the
soil.<p>
        
<b>Alfalfa (Medicago sativa)</b><p>

Alfalfa is the best legume for fixing nitrogen, if the soil is adequately
fertile. Because it's deep rooted, alfalfa draws nutrients from the
subsoil, which are returned to the topsoil when you turn the plants under.
It is high in protein, minerals, and vitamins. It's a perennial grown for
one year. Alfalfa needs a deep, well-drained soil, a pH near neutral, and
adequate amounts of phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and sulfur.<BR>
<I>Growing Guidelines:</I> Before planting, apply an inoculant. Sow in the
spring, planting 1.5 ounces per 100 square feet or 1 pound per 1000 square
feet.<p>

<b>Crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.)</b><p>

Crimson clover is a adapted to shady areas and grows well at low
temperatures. It's often left in place for a year. Crimson clover can grow
in both sandy and well-drained clayey soils if they're not extremely
acidic. The germinating seeds and young seedlings need to stay moist.
Crimson clover won't tolerate calcareous soil (soil high in limestone), and
needs a good supply of phosphorus and potassium.<BR>
<I>Growing Guidelines:</I> Apply an inoculant before planting. Sow in
October. Scatter 0.5 ounces per 100 square feet or 1 pound per 1000 square
feet. Cover with a half inch of soil and tamp down. Keep the soil moist
while the plants are young.<p>

<b>Soybeans (Glycine max)</b><p>

Grow soybeans, a summer annual legume, to add nitrogen to poorly drained
soils. Soybeans are often grown with a grass such as buckwheat. Soybeans do
best on a well-drained soil, with a moderate amount of moisture, but will
tolerate poor drainage.<BR>
<I>Growing Guidelines:</I> Apply an inoculant to the soil before planting.
Plant 3-5 ounces per 100 square feet or 2-3 pounds per 1000 square feet in
the spring or early- to mid-summer. Cover with an inch of soil.<p>

<b>Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum)</b><p>

Use winter wheat, an annual grass, as a short-term green manure that you
sow in the fall and turn under in the spring. Winter wheat prefers a
fertile, loamy soil and a neutral pH. <BR>
<I>Growing Guidelines:</I> In the late summer, plant 3-6 ounces per 100
square feet or 2-3 pounds per 1000 square feet.<p>

<b>Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum)</b><p>

Use buckwheat, a broadleaved non-legume annual, to quickly smother summer
weeds. It matures in two months; you can plant a second crop for full
summer coverage. Buckwheat builds organic matter and adds phosphorus to the
soil. Buckwheat grows in most soils, including infertile and acidic
ones.<BR>
<I>Growing Guidelines:</I> Plant 5 ounces per 100 square feet or 3 pounds
per 1000 square feet in the spring or summer.<p>

<b>Sweet clover (Melilotus spp.)</b><p>

Sweet clover is the best legume for improving poor or disturbed soils that
aren't acidic. It adds phosphorus, nitrogen, and large amounts of organic
matter to the soil. Its deep roots loosen the soil and draw nutrients from
the subsoil, which return to the top soil when you turn the green manure
under. Sweet clover requires a well-drained soil with a pH near neutral. It
absolutely won't tolerate acid soils.<BR>
<I>Growing Guidelines:</I> Sow in the spring or summer at a rate of 0.75 to
1.5 ounces per 100 square feet or 0.5-1 pound per 1000 square feet.<p>

<b>Vetch (Vicia spp.)</b><p>

There are several vetch species, including common vetch, hairy vetch, and
purple vetch. All are vining annual legumes that are often planted with
grasses. Use them as a winter annual to add nitrogen and organic matter to
any well-drained or droughty soil. Hairy vetch grows in most soil types,
while common vetch needs a fertile, loamy soil. All prefer well-drained
soils. The vetches are drought-tolerant.<BR>
<I>Growing Guidelines:</I> Apply an inoculant to the soil before planting.
Plant in the late fall unless you're growing common or purple vetch in the
North, in which case you should plant in the spring. Plant 3 ounces per 100
square feet or 2 pounds per acre. Cover with 0.75 inch of soil.<p>

<b>Ladino Clover</b><p>

Ladino clover is a tall variety of white clover. Because it dies during the
winter, you can more easily turn it under in the spring than regular white
clover. It produces more organic matter than white clover.<BR>
<I>Growing Guidelines:</I> Apply an inoculant to the soil before planting.
Plant in the fall, sowing 0.75 ounces of seed per 100 square feet or 0.5
pound per 1000 square feet. Turn under in the spring. <p>

<b>Winter Rye (Secale cereale)</b><p>

Because winter rye grows early in the spring and produces toxins that kill
seedlings, it's ideal for smothering weeds. Like other grasses, its fibrous
root system and succulent leaves add organic matter. Winter rye prefers a
well drained soil.<BR>
<I>Growing Guidelines:</I> Plant in the late summer or fall at a rate of 4
ounces per 100 square feet or 2.5 pounds per 1000 square feet. Grow
transplants or large-seeded plants after turning it under; small seeded
plants can't tolerate the toxic substances.<p>

<b>Sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor)</b><p>

Grow this tall grass during the summer to choke out weeds. It reduces the
number of nematodes in the soil and adds a lot of organic matter.
Sudangrass has a dense root system that makes it well suited to erosion
control and adds organic matter. Sudangrass survives drought well but
performs better with more water, especially in the Southwest. It adapts to
poorly drained soils.<BR>
<I>Growing Guidelines:</I> When the soil is warm, plant 1.5-3 ounces per
100 square feet or 1-2 pounds per 1000 square feet.<p>

<H1>ORGANIC FERTILIZERS AND AMENDMENTS</H1>
</center>


<H3>WHY USE ORGANIC FERTILIZERS?</H3>

Most "organic" fertilizers (those derived from plant, mineral, and animal
sources) release nutrients more slowly than do synthetic fertilizers. So
they are less likely to burn plants, pollute groundwater, or kill soil
organisms that are part of a healthy ecosystem. They also provide a small
but steady supply of nutrients, which is more useful that the large,
short-term supply that synthetic fertilizers provide. And many organic
fertilizers supply plants with necessary micronutrients, or trace elements,
not found in synthetic fertilizers.<p>


<H3>BUYING ORGANIC FERTILIZER</H3>

Fertilizer labels list three numbers, separated by hyphens; for example,
3-5-3. The first number is the percentage of available nitrogen (N), the
second is available phosphorus (P), and the third is available potassium
(K). These numbers are sometimes called the NPK ratio or the nutrient
analysis.<p>



The nutrient analysis for organic fertilizers is often lower than those for
synthetic ones. That's because labeling laws allow only the immediately
available nutrients to be listed, not the total. The nutrients in most
organic fertilizers aren't very soluble, so they're released gradually. For
example, rock phosphate contains about 32% total phosphorus, but only about
2% is available at any one time.  Over time, however, the total amount of
nutrients released from organic fertilizers is higher than the label
suggests.<p>



An organic fertilizer may contain necessary nutrients besides N, P, and K.
Bonemeal, for example, is high in calcium as well as phosphorus. Liquid
seaweed contains many micronutrients. Read the label carefully for
information on other materials the fertilizer contains, what it's made
from, and what effect the material has on plants and soil organisms. <p>


<H3>APPLYING FERTILIZERS</H3>

Fertilizers can be solids or liquids. Solid fertilizers, which you apply
dry, may be fine powders, large granules, or something in between.
Fertilizers you apply wet may come as powders that you dissolve in water or
as concentrates that you dilute with water.<p>



Dry fertilizers work more slowly but last longer. You can spread a dry
fertilizer evenly over a large area, a method called broadcasting. Or you
can sprinkle dry fertilizer next to a plant, or beside a row of plants,
which is called sidedressing. To get the nutrients to the roots faster when
you sidedress, lightly scratch the fertilizer into the soil, being careful
not to nick the roots or stem. Another way to use dry fertilizers is to put
them in the hole at planting time; because most organic fertilizers aren't
very soluble, you don't have to worry about burning the roots.<p>



To apply a liquid fertilizer, first dissolve or dilute it according to
label instructions. You can pour it into the soil at the base of the plant
(this is called a soil drench). Or you can spray the fertilizer on the
leaves (this is called foliar feeding). Because plants close down their
leaf pores when it's sunny or hot, apply foliar fertilizers early or late
in the day, or during a cloudy spell. Spray them to the tops and underside
of the leaves until the liquid runs off.<p>



An amendment is something that improves the soil without necessarily adding
nutrients. Amendments can make clay soil looser or sandy soil hold water
better. Limestone and sulfur are soil amendments because the change the pH
(the acidity) of the soil.  <p>


<H3>ORGANIC FERTILIZERS</H3>


Most of these fertilizers provide one or two nutrients, although some are
more balanced. You can buy organic fertilizer blends that provide a range
of nutrients plants need. <p>


<b>Bloodmeal</b><p>

Dried animal blood. About 15% nitrogen, readily available. Lasts 3-4
months. Apply 3 lbs. per 100 sq. ft. for soils low in nitrogen, 2 lbs. for
soils with moderate nitrogen, and 1 lbs. for soils with adequate nitrogen.
Rake it into the surface of the soil; it washes into the root zone. 


<b>Bonemeal</b><p>

NOT FOR TEXAS. Finely ground and steamed animal bones, used mainly as a
phosphorus source. 11% phosphorus, 1% nitrogen, and 24% calcium. Lasts 6-12
months. Use only on acidic soils (the calcium increases alkalinity).
Phosphorus is available more quickly than with rock phosphate (described
below). Apply before planting when the soil temperature is above 55 degrees
F. Apply 3 lbs. per 100 sq. ft. on soils low in phosphorus, 2 lbs. on soils
with moderate phosphorus, and 1 lb. on soils with adequate phosphorus. Work
it into the top 6 inches of soil.<p>


<b>Fish meal</b><p>

Dried and ground fish parts. A good source of nitrogen. Analysis is 6-3-3.
Lasts one season. Apply at planting. Broadcast 3 lbs. per 100 sq. ft. on
poor soils, 2 lbs. per 100 sq. ft. on moderately fertile soils, or 1 lb. on
fertile soils. If sidedressing, use the same rates per 100 foot of row.<p>


<b>Granite meal (Also called granite dust)</b><p>

Ground granite. 3-5% potassium, 67% silica (sand), and  micronutrients.
Slow release. One application can last 10 years. Improves soil structure.
Broadcast 10 lbs. per 100 sq. ft. on soils low in potassium, 5 lbs. on
soils with moderate potassium, and 2.5 lbs. on soils with adequate
potassium. Rake into the soil surface. <p>


<b>Greensand (also called glauconite)</b><p>

Sand-based fertilizer mined from dried ocean deposits. Slow-release source
of potassium (an application can last up to 10 years). Contains 5-7%
potassium, trace minerals, and silica. Helps loosen clay soils. Apply in
autumn. Broadcast 10 lbs. per 100 sq. ft. on soils low in potassium, 5 lbs.
per 100 sq. ft. on soils with moderate potassium, and 2.5 lbs. on soils
with adequate potassium.<p>

<b>Kelp/Seaweed</b><p>

Comes as solid or as liquid concentrate. High in potassium and
micronutrients.  Solid form adds organic matter. For the solid, work about
10 lbs. per 100 sq. ft. into the soil. For the liquid, follow label
directions for dilution.<p>

<b>Langbeinite (also called sulfate of potash magnesia)</b><p>

Quick-release potassium. Also adds magnesium and sulfur. Broadcast up to 1
lb. per 100 sq. ft. The easily dissolved potassium can burn plants if you
apply too much. Sold as Sul-Po-Mag and K-Mag. <p>

<b>Manure</b><p>

Solid animal waste. Provides nutrients and organic matter. Nutrient content
varies with the type of animal and its diet. Fresh manure's high nitrogen
content can burn plants, so either apply several months before planting or
let it age in a compost pile for several months before applying to the soil
around plants. Apply 10-20 lbs. per 100 sq. ft.<p>

<b>Rock Phosphate</b><p>

NOT FOR TEXAS. Crushed and washed rock. 33% total phosphorus; only about 3%
is available at any time. High in calcium, so use only on acidic soils.
Apply directly to the soil and work into the top 6 inches, or add to
compost pile in autumn. Apply 6 lbs. per 100 sq. ft. for soils low in
phosphorus, 2.5 lbs. for soils with medium phosphorus, 1 lb. per 100 sq.
ft. for soil with adequate phosphorus.<p>

<b>Wood Ash</b><p>

NOT FOR TEXAS. About 12% potassium; varies with the type and age of the
wood. Contains large amounts of calcium and micronutrients. Apply to acidic
soils only (do not use on soil with a pH above 6). Apply no more than 2
lbs. per 100 sq. ft. every 3-4 years, because excess amounts can cause
nutrient imbalances. Turn it under the soil in the early spring, avoiding
young plants.<p>


<H3>SOIL AMENDMENTS</H3>


Some soil amendments add small amounts of nutrients to the soil, but their
main purpose is to improve the soil in some other way. Some change the
soil's pH (its acidity) making many nutrients more available to plants.
Others add organic matter, which loosens clay soils and makes sandy soils
hold water and nutrients better.<p>

<b>Compost</b><p>

Decayed and partially decayed plant waste, either from the garden or
kitchen. Adds nutrients and organic matterto the soil, and stimulates soil
microorganisms. Nutrient analysis varies with what materials are in it and
how long it's aged (range is 1/2-1/2-1/2 to 4-4-4). <p>

<b>Grass clippings</b><p>

Adds organic matter to the soil and stimulates worms and other soil
microorganisms. Fresh clippings also add nitrogen. Analysis averages
0.5-0.2-0.5.  Work fresh clippings into bare soil before planting, using 50
lbs. per 100 sq. ft. for soils low in nitrogen, 30 lbs. for soils with
moderate nitrogen, and 20 lbs. to maintain soil nitrogen. Or spread a
2-inch layer around the base of existing plants.<p>

<b>Gypsum (Also called land plaster)</b><p>

Calcium sulfate powder. Contains 22% calcium and 17% sulfur. Loosens clay
soils and neutralizes excessive sodium or magnesium in soils. Broadcast 4
lbs. per 100 sq. ft. over soils low in calcium, 2 lbs. per 100 sq. ft. to
soils with a moderate level of calcium, and 1/2 lb. to soils with adequate
calcium. Work it into the soil.<p>

<b>Limestone</b><p>

NOT NEEDED IN TEXAS. Decreases the acidity of soils, making them more
alkaline. Effect lasts several years. Apply 8 lbs. per 100 sq. ft. on clay
soil, 6 lbs. on loams, and 2 lbs. on sands. Use calcitic limestone on most
soils; use dolomitic limestone on soils low in magnesium. Have the soil
retested a year after application and reapply if necessary. <p>

<b>Sulfur</b><p>

Sulfur decreases the soil pH, making alkaline soils more acidic. The
results are short-term. Broadcast 1 lb. per 100 sq. ft. to lower the pH by
one full point (for example, from 8 to 7. Mix the sulfur into the top 3
inches of soil. If you need to apply more than a pound, apply half in the
late winter or early spring and half in autumn after harvest. To lower the
pH around existing plants, scrape the sulfur into the soil at the base of
the plant, as far out as the end of its branches. Have the soil retested a
each year and reapply if necessary.<p>

<b>Worm castings</b><p>

Worm manure. All-around soil improver. Source of organic matter and small
amounts of plant nutrients. Apply 25 lbs. per 100 sq. ft. to soils low in
organic matter, 10 lbs. to soils with a moderate amount of organic matter,
and 5 lbs. to soil with adequate organic matter. Work into the soil before
planting or apply to the surface after planting. <p>

<H1>MULCHING TO CONTROL WEEDS AND SAVE WATER</H1>
</center>



Mulching is the practice of covering the soil surface with a material that
smothers weeds and delays the evaporation of moisture from the soil.
Although most people think of mulches as being dead plant material such as
pine needles or bark chips, anything that keeps weeds down and moisture in
can be considered a mulch (including aluminum foil, old carpeting, and
low-growing non-competitive plants).<p>


<b>Good Reasons for Mulching</b><p>

The right mulch can just about eliminate the need to pull weeds. Only the
most tenacious perennials poke through, such as yellow nutsedge or
johnsongrass. Mulches also prevent weeds seeds from reaching the soil.
Instead, they fall on an inhospitable surface, where they languish.<p>


By covering the soil surface, mulches reduce the amount of sunlight and
wind that reaches the soil, so water evaporates from the soil more slowly.
And the soil stays cooler, so the roots stay cooler (a big help in the heat
of the summer).<p>


A mulch derived from plants (such as grass clippings, cocoa hulls, or
shredded pine bark) can also add organic matter to the soil, improving its
structure and fertility and encouraging a healthy population of
microorganisms.<p>


Finally, mulches can make a garden more attractive, especially a new one
where the plants have yet to fill in. And when it rains, a mulch keeps soil
from splashing onto the leaves or nearby paved surfaces or buildings.<p>

<b>A Few Cautions</b><p>

Mulches do have some drawbacks. For one thing, insects such as slugs and
earwigs love the moist shady hiding place a mulch provides. If the insects
are abundant enough to cause serious damage, you need to rake off the mulch
for a while.<p>

Another drawback is that organic mulches cause a temporary boom in the
population of soil microorganisms, which can tie up some soil nutrients.
This boom is especially a problem with mulches high in carbon, such as wood
chips. To compensate, fertilize first with a high-nitrogen fertilizer such
as rotted manure or bloodmeal. Or put a high-carbon mulch on top of a layer
of balanced mulch, such as grass clippings or compost. You can add
nitrogen, phosphorus, and (in alkaline soils) sulfur to make sure there's
enough left for the plants. <p>

<b>Choosing and Using Mulches</b><p>

When choosing a mulch, consider how long you want it to last, how
attractive you want it to be, what's available, and how much you want to
spend.<p>


In general, the bigger the pieces in the mulch, the longer it lasts. Soil
organisms can digest a blade of clipped grass pretty quickly, but might
need a year or two to chomp through a pine bark nugget. And juicy
materials, like compost, deteriorate faster than woody ones, like
newspaper. So if you want a long-lasting mulch, as you might around trees
and shrubs, choose bark nuggets or another big, woody material. If you want
a mulch that deteriorates in a season, as you might to improve the soil in
a vegetable garden, go with something small and juicy like grass clippings
or apple pomace.<p>


Whatever material you choose, you want to apply it deep enough to control
weeds, but not so deep that it smothers the roots of your garden plants.
How deep that is depends on the plant, how dense the mulch is, and how well
aerated the soil is. Start by putting a 1-2 inch mulch around flowers and
vegetables and a 3-4 inch mulch around trees and shrubs. If weeds pop
through, add another inch. As the mulch breaks down, add more.<p>


The final considerations are how easy the mulch is to find and how much it
costs. Some mulches, such as newspaper and grass clippings, are easy to
come by and inexpensive. Others, like bark mulch, are also easy to come by
but cost a few bucks a bag. And some mulches, such as mushroom compost,
cocoa shells, apple pomace, and pecan shells, are often limited to areas
where there are mushroom farms, candy factories, cider presses, and pecan
groves.<p>

<H3>Some Mulching Materials</H3>


<B>Bark chunks</B>, sometimes called nuggets, are attractive pieces of bark
about three inches in diameter. Because they're so large and woody, they
last a long time (years in some climates). Of the various sizes of bark
mulches, they are the best for weed control. Bark chunks are so coarse
textured that they don't encourage a big growth spurt in the soil
microorganism population that can tie up soil nutrients.<p>


Their slow decomposition means you'll have to put a finer organic material
under them if you want to improve the soil; try manure or compost. Because
the bulky pieces decay slowly, don't turn them under the soil, where they
can create air pockets near plant roots.<p>


<I>How to Use:</I>   Bark chunks are a good ornamental mulch for trees and
shrubs, or for covering the spaces between plants in a new planting. Spread
to a depth of about 3-4 inches.<p>


<B>Wood chips</B> are small pieces of wood about an inch in diameter. The
chips make a decorative mulch that breaks down faster than bark chunks,
adding more organic matter to the soil. Wood chips are high in carbon,
making soil organisms tie up nitrogen and other soil nutrients as they work
to digest the chips. Bags labeled "wood chips" can contain wood other than
bark, including leftovers from the timber trade that might have been
treated with chemicals that harm plants. Freshly chipped wood needs to sit
for a few months before you use it, since the tree might have contained
natural substances toxic to young plants. Small chips may bounce onto
sidewalks during a downpour.<p>


<I>How to Use:</I>  Spread to a depth of about 3-4 inches around trees and
shrubs, or in the spaces between plants in a new planting. <p>


<B>Shredded Bark</B> is narrow strips of bark a few inches long. They break
down faster that chunks or chips, so you can turn them into the soil after
a year or two as a source of organic matter. Shredded bark costs less than
bark chunks. Shredded bark is high in carbon, so soil microorganisms draw
nitrogen and other nutrients from the soil supply as they break the bark
down. Shredded bark can float out of plant beds in a downpour. Fresh
shredded cypress mulch may be toxic to seedlings. Shredded bark is far less
effective for smothering weeds than are bark chunks.<p>


<I>How to Use:</I>  Spread a 4-inch layer around trees, shrubs, and
flowers. <p>


<B>Compost</B> is a fertile mulch you can make. It's an ideal soil-building
mulch for vegetable gardens or flower beds that you plan to turn under.
However, fully decomposed mulch is too fine to smother aggressive weeds.
Partially decomposed compost is bulkier and better at controlling weeds,
but can trigger a burst of activity in soil organisms that temporarily
which ties up nitrogen; compensate by adding a little bloodmeal or other
source of nitrogen.<p>


<I>How to Use:</I>  Apply at 2-4 inch layer around vegetables and annual
and perennial flowers, keeping it about an inch from the stems to prevent
rot.<p>


<B>Hay and Straw</B> are loose mulches, so they don't block air flow to the
roots of plants. Both are good winter mulches for roses, strawberries, and
other perennials. Hay is higher in nitrogen than many mulches, so its
decomposition doesn't tie up soil nutrients. Hay can contain weed seed.
Straw is usually free of weed seed and is often used to keep newly seeded
lawns moist between waterings. It attracts spiders that control insect
pests, repels some aphids, and impedes the movement of Colorado potato
beetles. Straw lasts longer than hay, but is woody enough to make soil
organisms tie up nutrients, so add a little bloodmeal or other nitrogen
source.  Because neither is a dense mulch, some weeds can pop through
it.<p>


<I>How to Use:</I>  Apply in a 4-6 inch layer.<p>


<B>Shredded leaves</B> make a lightweight, insulating mulch well suited to
protecting roses and other woody perennials during the winter. Although you
can buy shredders, your lawn mower is probably the best shredding tool
around. Rake the leaves into along, low pile and run the mower over it,
catching the leaves in a bag. Or make a tall round pile and tilt the mower
back, then onto the pile.<p>


<I>How to Use:</I> Apply is a 4-6 inch layer.<p>


<B>Grass clippings</B> add organic matter to the soil. Because grass
clipping have a good balance of carbon and nitrogen, they don't make soil
organisms tie up soil nitrogen. Fresh clippings sometimes get moldy.
Because the clippings break down quickly, you have to replenish them often.
Grass that's gone to seed or contains weed seeds can create a weed problem
in the garden.<p>


<I>How to Use:</I>  If you're applying fresh clippings, add a thin layer
(1-2 inches). Use 2-4 inches of dried clippings. Replenish as
necessary.<p>


<B>Cocoa bean shells</B> are clean, weed-free, and smell of bitter
chocolate when first applied. They add nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium
to the soil. The long-lasting shells are attractive, lightweight, and easy
to handle, but can blow around. They also mold easily.<p>


<I>How to Use:</I> Apply a 1-2 inch layer.<p>


<B>Leaf mold</B> is leaves that have been composted with no other material.
Leaf mold makes a humus rich in micronutrients. Because leaf mold has had
time to decompose, its ratio of carbon to nitrogen is more favorable than
fresh leaves. When added the soil surface as a mulch, it adds organic
matter to the soil, whether or not you turn it under. It can take several
years for leaves to decompose into leaf mold.<p>


<I>How to Use:</I>  Shred the leaves first by raking them into piles and
running the lawn mower over them. Then dump the shredded leaves in a pile;
you may want to build a wire bin to contain them. To make the leaves break
down quicker, keep them moist and fluff them with a pitch fork every month
or so. The leaf mold is ready when its soft and crumbly. Add up to four
inches to the soil surface as a mulch.<p>


<B>Sawdust</B> adds organic matter, helps lower the pH of alkaline soils,
and repels some insects. Sawdust is so high in carbon that you'll need to
add extra nitrogen, unless you compost it.<p>


<I>How to Use:</I>  It's a good idea to compost sawdust before adding it to
the soil surface, both to lower the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and to give
any toxic substances in the wood a chance to leach out. Then spread 1-2
inches on the soil surface. You can turn it under at the end of the
season.<p>


<B>Newspaper sheets</B> provide a barrier that weeds have a tough time
breaking but water can easily pass through. Newspaper breaks down over
time, adding organic matter to the soil. It's inexpensive and readily
available. Deciding how thick to make the layer can be tricky. If it's too
thin, it won't last as long as you want and weeds will pop up. Too thick,
and you'll have to pull it up at the end of the season if you want to turn
the soil or add fertilizer. How rainy the season is affects how long the
paper lasts. Newspaper is high in carbon, so if you work it into the soil
after it disintegrates you'll need to add extra nitrogen.<p>


<I>How to Use:</I>  Lay sheets of paper on the soil surface and weight them
with grass clippings, stones, or some other material to keep them from
blowing away. Try making the layer 10 sections thick to start with; reapply
if the layer breaks down before the season ends. Don't use colored sections
of the newspaper, which may contain toxic dyes.<p>

is the last home game of the season; so don't miss this opportunity. I
have twenty seats reserved at the blue line and can get more if needed.
We will need to be at the Texas Exposition by 7:00 p.m. Please get the
$7 entry fee to Ken Jacquin before Feb. 16th. I will give out the

seriously, this will make sense when you read the rest of
this announcement). Racing starts at 1:00 p.m. and continues until 6:00
p.m. They will also have simulcast racing from other tracks throughout
the country. You can bet on both the live and simulcast races. We will
have reserved grandstand covered seats for a total cost of approximately
$7. Put this on your calendar.
<P>
<H3>May</H3>

<P>
<P>May ??     Spring Campout &#173; stay tuned for more information.


<P><B>Shameless Pleading: <BR>

<P>The Austin Skiers club is a social club for snow skiers and sports
enthusiasts. The club membership comes from around Central Texas and
numbers around 400 people from all walks of life. The primary
objective of the club is to promote and encourage individual and
group interest in the sport of snow skiing; this is accomplished
through the sponsorship of a variety of
<A HREF="97skitrp.htm">trips.</A>
</P>

<P>Our club information line can be reached at: <B>335-3662</B></P>

<P>The Austin Skiers club is a nonprofit organization and is
incorporated under the laws of the State of Texas. We are an
affiliated member of the Texas Ski Council (TSC). The Texas Ski
Council represents over 15,000 skiers throughout Texas. Many of our
trips are booked in conjunction with the Texas Ski Council and you'll
be hard pressed to find a better value for your skiing dollar.</P>

<P>Membership is open to people who are eighteen years of age or
older and their families. Families are certainly welcome! Please see
our <A HREF="memapp.txt">Membership Application.</A></P>

<P>In addition to monthly meetings, weekly happy hours and a whole
range of sports activities, you'll find a group of people that are a
lot of fun! Hope to see you at one of our
<A HREF="skisched.htm">upcoming events!</A><BR>

future events. &nbsp;
<P><IMG SRC=purcube.gif>There will be no Juliette Low Birthday Fest in 1996

<P>This site is no longer new, but we are adding to our cyberinfo
as time permits (volunteers are <I>so</I> unpredictable).  
Any Capitol Area Council units or chartering organizations wishing to 
publish their information on this Website or have a link provided to their 
own site should contact the

<H2>February 3, 1997</H2>

<P>Welcome to a new year and to a new unit on the CyberBase, <A href="t162.htm"> Troop 162 of Austin </A>.

<P>I apologize to all who have been anxiously awaiting this update, but the pressures of family, 
work and my other Scouting activities have long delayed me from finding the time to get this ready.

<P>Many thanks to the Scouters, Explorers and Arrowmen who helped out with the best Longhorn District Camporee ever.  Despite the shaky weather forecasts, we had a great weekend of cool days and cold nights with no precipitation.  

<P><A href="c29home.htm"> Cub Pack 29 </A> has moved their home to another server, but we will maintain a reflector page on the CyberBase for them.

<P>We had a great turnout at the Longhorn District Annual Awards Banquet last Thursday evening.  New holders of the District Award of Merit are Wyn Speir, Maggie Trevino and Phil Scott.  Horns of Excellence were awarded to Bill Agnell, Nico Pena and ?  Wyn Speir was also recognized for his outstanding leadership as District Chairman for the last two years.  In both of these years, Longhorn District has earned the Quality District award. Congratulations to the honorees! Congressman Lloyd Doggett gave us a keynote about the lasting impact of adults working with youth.  Great food and fellowship were organized by Karl Olsen, Art Williams, Bill Agnell and a supporting group from University Avenue Church of Christ.   Many thanks to Congressman Doggett and the volunteers of the Longhorn District!

<P>Since our last update, Troop 49 crewed aboard the Lady Lex, also known as the Blue Ghost, the U.S.S. Lexington, and CV-16, a retired Navy aircraft carrier that saw service from WW-II to 1991.  Stationed in Corpus Christi and outfitted as a naval air museum, the Lady Lex provides an exciting live aboard program tailored to Scouts of all ages.  Eat Navy food, view the exhibits, tour the ship, ride the flight simulator, sleep in crew quarters, attend assemblies and meet a staff of dedicated volunteers who will involve everyone in the program.  You can also visit the Texas State Aquarium or Columbus' replica fleet.  We had fun and so will you.

<P>Troop 49's December campout in the Elkhart pines has been rescheduled for the 13th through 15th.

<P>Longhorn District announced the guest speaker for the Annual District Awards Banquet, Congressman Lloyd Doggett, at a well attended roundtable last Thursday night.  Many thanks to the speaker from R.E.I. who enlightened us about backpacking stoves, too.

<P>The Annual District Awards Banquet will be held on December 12, 7:00 p.m. at  University Avenue Church of Christ.  Bring your family, a side dish and a healthy appetite to celebrate another successful year and cheer the volunteers who made it happen.  

<P>Post 49 has a few youth slots remaining for our crew going to Philmont in '97.  Deposits are due immediately.

<P>In celebration of National American Indian Heritage Month, a number of links to native american resources have been added to the <A href="oa99.htm"> Tonkawa Lodge #99 - Order of the Arrow </A> page.

<P>Since our last update, Troop 49 went backpacking at Lost Maples and Post 49 attended its first event, the Explorer Super Activity at Lost Pines.  Sounds like we might be kinda lost, huh?

<P>Troop 49 now has a crew going to Philmont in '97.  Deposits are due immediately if you want to fill one of the remaining slots.

<P>Although I haven't received my copy yet, the new issue of Scouting magazine is reported to have a mention of our CyberBase website on page 38.  Yet another reason to read this valuable Scouting publication.  I'm sure I will when it arrives.

<P>For most of the units in our Council, re-chartering time is drawing near.  If you need help with this task, contact your Unit or District Commissioners.

<P>The annual Trails End Popcorn sale is underway!

<P>We've been promised some information about the 1997 Wood Badge course, so stay tuned for our next update.

<P>My, how time flies...  On October 12, CAC CyberBase was one year old.  If I'd known then...  Cliches seem the only appropriate comments to express the enormity of looking back on the last year.

Well, Troop 49 is now up and running on the World Wide Web 
courtesy of the folks at 
<A HREF="http://www.main.org/"> Metropolitan Austin Interactive Network </A>.
We have a <A href="t49home.htm">Troop 49 Home Page</A>, a

and an <A HREF="oa99.htm">O.A. Tonkawa Lodge Page</A>.  The Council Home 
Page has links to some other Scout resources on the WWW.  We hope to add
new information about Scouting in the Capitol Area in the near future.  
Stay tuned as we continue to learn how to make this work and look better.

<p>It is the Mission of the Boy Scouts of America to serve others

prepare them to make ethical choices over their lifetime in achieving
their full potential. The values we strive to instill are based
on those found in the <a href="bsbasics.htm#oath">Boy Scout Oath </a>and <a

<h2><a name="purp">Purpose of the Boy Scouts of America</a></h2>

<p>The purpose of the Boy Scouts of America is to promote,
through cooperation with other agencies, the ability of youth to
do things for themselves and others, and to teach youth patriotism,
courage, self-reliance, and kindred virtues. In achieving this
purpose, emphasis is placed upon the Boy Scouts of America's
educational program and its oaths, promises and codes for
character development, citizenship training, and mental and
physical fitness. </p>

<h2><a name="decl">Declaration of Religious Principle</a></h2>

<p>The Boy Scouts of America maintains that no member can grow into the
best kind of citizen without recognizing an obligation to God
and, therefore, recognizes the religious element in the training of
the member, but is absolutely non-sectarian in its attitude
toward that religious training. The Boy Scouts of America's
policy is that the home and the organization or group with which
the member is connected shall give definite attention to religious
life. </p>

<p>Only persons willing to subscribe to this Declaration of
Religious Principle and to the Bylaws of the Boy Scouts of
America shall be entitled to certificates of leadership. </p>

<p>Membership in the Boys Scouts of America is open to all boys

Scouting units are open to all youth without regard to race or
ethnic background and are based entirely upon individual merit. </p>

<h2><a name="adults">Scouting is for Adults</a></h2>

<p>The Boy Scouts of America offers its educational resource program, based
on duty to God and country, to community-based organizations to
use as a way of reaching out to children, youth, adults, and
families. </p>

<p>While generally thought of as a program of activities and
learning experiences for youngsters, the Boy Scouts of America
has much to offer the adult in a local organization. Among the
benefits are: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Leadership training </li>
    <li>Leadership experience </li>
    <li>Responsibility </li>
    <li>Building self-esteem </li>
    <li>Building self-concept </li>
    <li>Role modeling </li>
    <li>Values sharing </li>
    <li>Teaching skills </li>
    <li>Mentor relationships </li>
    <li>Improving mind, body, person </li>
    <li>Adventure </li>
    <li>Activities </li>
    <li>Insignia and uniform </li>
    <li>Recognition </li>
    <li>Fellowship </li>
</ul>

<p>To obtain more information about how the Scouting program can be used
to impact the lives of adults as well as children, youth, and families
in your organization, call the local Scouting council. It is listed in
the white pages under Boy Scouts of America. </p>

family's influence on a child's development. </p>

<p>Ample opportunities can be found in the program of the Boy Scouts of
America to strengthen and to enrich family life. </p>

<p>Chartered organizations can use Scouting as a resource to
impact families. Participation offers opportunities for: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Quality time together as a family unit. </li>
    <li>Increasing communications skills. </li>
    <li>Learning new skills together. </li>

<h3>Special Programs</h3>

<p>Boy Scouts of America also provides some special programs to supplement
or support unit activities: </p>

<ul>
    <li><b><i>B.S.A. Family Program</i></b> - resources that can
        help today's families accomplish worthy goals while
        building and strengthening relationships among family
        members </li>
    <li><b><i>Religious Awareness</i></b> - Religious emblem
        programs sponsored by many religious faiths are available
        for Scouts to demonstrate faith, observe the creeds or
        principles of the faith, and give service. Religious
        emblems are not Scouting awards; they are presented by
        religious groups to Scouts who earn them. </li>
    <li><a href="Bsaethic.htm"><b><i>Ethics Programs</i></b></a>
        - Scouts are growing up in a complicated world where they
        are subject to many negative influences that conflict
        with the values their parents are trying to help them learn.
        Ethics activities are designed to reinforce those positive values,
        including honesty, fairness, respect for others, and maintenance
        of a healthy self. </li>
    <li><b><i>Camping Programs</i></b> - Day camps, family camps,
        resident camps and high adventure camps are supported by
        B.S.A. and local councils to provide the camping and
        outdoor activities that fulfill a Scout's dreams of fun,
        excitement and adventure. </li>
    <li><b><i>Sports and Academic Programs</i></b> - Scouts may
        pursue a learning process in academics and physical
        fitness, achieve recognition and have fun at the same
        time. </li>
    <li><b><i>Crime Prevention, Youth Protection and Drug Abuse Awareness </i></b>-
        These special issues impact the lives of every Scouting
        family and B.S.A. has designed age appropriate programs
        to educate and prepare our Scouts and Leaders to deal
        with them as they arise. </li>
    <li><b><i>Learning for Life </i></b>- An in-school program
        that brings the positive values and personal development
        approaches of Scouting to students in traditionally disadvantaged
        areas. </li>
    <li><b><i>Scouting for Youth with Disabilities </i></b>-
        These program resources are designed to help Scout
        leaders develop a sensitivity for different disabilities
        and to consider methods of adapting the program to help
        all Scouts succeed. Scouts with disabilities participate
        in specially organized or regular units with activities
        modified when needed to fit their own abilities and urge
        them to do their personal best. </li>
    <li><b><i>Leadership and Unit Support Programs</i></b><i> </i>-
        B.S.A. and its local councils provide many resources to
        develop Scout leaders and support the delivery of
        Scouting programs including training, publications,
        videos, recognition awards and assistance from
        professional or volunteer staff. </li>

<h2><a name="smp">Smoke-Free Policy </a></h2>

<p>It is the responsiblity of the Boy Scouts of America to
protect the health and safety of the young people in our program.
It is the policy of the Boys Scouts of America that leaders should
not use tobacco products in any form in the presence of youth
members. In addition, extreme care should be exercised to provide
smoke-free environments for all Scouting participants. Therefore, </p>

<p><b>All buildings are to be designated as non-smoking
facilities. Smoking outside entrance/exit doors is not permitted
at any location. In addition, all Scouting functions, meetings,
or activities should be conducted on a smoke-free basis with permitted
smoking areas located away from all participants. </b></p>

Welcome to our Lodge</A></H2>

<P>
The Order of the Arrow is a National Brotherhood of Scout Honor Campers.  
Tonkawa Lodge's main purpose is to provide cheerful service to the Boy 
Scouts of America while developing Scouts into leaders.  The Lodge consists 
of several Chapters, one for Explorers and one
for each district in the Council.  The Lodge's spiritual home is at 
<A href="lpsr.htm">Lost Pines Scout Reservation, Lake Bastrop, Texas.</A>
A project is underway to fund and construct a combined Medic's and Lodge building at L.P.S.R. 
<P>
Scouts must complete specific eligibility requirements 
and be nominated by their unit through elections to become a candidate
for membership in OA.  They must then complete the Ordeal to become full 
members of the Order.  
<P>
Remember --  Those who seek the Arrow will not find it!

The Tonkawa Story</A></H2>

<P>The chief has suggested that our members would like to know something about the Tonkawa, the Native American tribe that is our Lodge's namesake.  From his mouth to my ears this wind blew and caused me to locate some pieces of their saga for your eyes.  Here begins my sparse story of the Tonkawa.</P>
  
<table border=0>
<tr>
<td width=20% align=center valign=center><em>Diet</em>  </td>
<td width=75%>
<P><strong>They were a nomadic buffalo hunting people roaming from somewhere around what is now Hillsboro, Texas to the vicinity of present day San Antonio, Texas.  They lived in scattered villages of tepees constructed from buffalo hides or arbors made from brush and grass.  They ate most kinds of small game, fish and shellfish. They excepted the coyote and wolf from their diet for religious reasons.  They collected nuts (especially pecans), herbs, acorns and fruits to supplement their meats.  They even attempted some farming in the latter part of the eighteenth century.
</strong></P></td></tr>
<td width=20% align=center valign=center><em>Matriarchal?</em> </td>
<td width=75%>
<P><strong>Their tribal culture was similar to many Plains Indian tribes, especially the Crow.  Each band of Tonkawa elected a chief to lead them under an elected tribal head chief.  Clan membership, determined by the mother's clan, was another important aspect of Tonkawa society.  Marriage came with little ceremony, but funeral rites were extensive.  Mourning lasted three days and was followed by a four day pipe smoking purification.
</strong></P></td></tr>
<td width=20% align=center valign=center><em>Dress</em></td>
<td width=75%>
<P><strong>The Tonkawa were notable warriors who used bows, spears and firearms.  The warriors wore protective leather jackets and caps decorated with horn and brilliant plumage.  They traded tallow, deerskins and buffalo robes to the Spanish to obtain their first firearms in the late 18th century.  The Tonkawa are known to have worn breastplates, chokers and ear pendants made with hair pipes.  Breechclout, leggings and moccasins completed their warm weather clothing.  A buffalo robe would be added on top for cold weather.
</strong></P></td></tr>
<td width=20% align=center valign=center><em>Adornment</em> </td>
<td width=75%>
<P><strong>Male and female Tonkawans tattoed and painted their bodies for adornment or religious purposes.  A picture taken in 1871 shows Castile, a Tonkawan, with a long belt made of linked silver conchos, each an oval of about four by six inches.  A line of small silver buttons or beads runs down the outside of each of his leggings.  He is wearing a beaded feather hanging from over his right ear and dangling in front of his shoulder.  Castile is reported to have been chief of the Tonkawas and a scout for both the Texas Rangers and the U.S. Army.
</strong></P></td></tr>
<td width=20% align=center valign=center><em>Cannibals?</em> </td>
<td width=75%>
<P><strong>Exaggerated reports of cannibalism among the Texas tribes were also applied to the Tonkawa.  The Spanish most likely misunderstood a ceremonial use of the slain enemies' bodies during victory celebrations.  Probably the Spanish reports originated from the lands of the Karankawa tribe on the Gulf Coast, not the lands of the Tonkawa.  Later Hispanics and Anglos perpetuated these tales, even claiming to have witnessed the severing, cooking and consumption of enemy hands and feet.  It is difficult today to know if these reports were true, but a reputation for cannibalism was certainly associated with the Tonkawa in the nineteenth century.
</strong></P></td></tr>
<td width=20% align=center valign=center><em>Epidemics</em>  </td>
<td width=75%>
<P><strong>Though no specific Tonkawan instances are mentioned in the history books, the impact of Spanish horses and European diseases on Texas tribes was tremendous.  The horse revolutionized the nomadic way of life, while the diseases brought by explorers, missionaries, soldiers and settlers wiped out perhaps 95 percent of Texas Indians by 1890.  Also, the pushing of Northern and Eastern tribes into Texas by European encroachments embroiled the Texas tribes in many inter-tribal conflicts.  These may have been reasons for the merging of several bands and tribes which created the Tonkawa nation.
</strong></P></td></tr>
<td width=20% align=center valign=center><P><em>Gathered from the Four Winds</em><BR><IMG alt="*" src="./gifs/osg4wind.gif"></p></td>
<td width=75%>
<P><strong>An early Spanish letter lists the Tonkawans (a group of three or four different tribes including the Mayeyes) as being west of the Karankawas, who dwelt between the mouths of the Neches and Nueces rivers on the Gulf Coast. The Tonkawa, as they came to be called, may be interrelated to the Lipan, Karankawa, Wichita and other tribes which joined together in the early eighteenth century.  The name Tonkawa is a Waco word meaning &quot;they all stay together&quot;.  The Tonkawa of this period were also reported as fighting with the Caddo tribes in East Texas over hunting grounds. 
</strong></P></td></tr>
<td width=20% align=center valign=center><em>Missions</em> </td>
<td width=75%>
<P><strong>From 1746 to 1756, the Spanish operated three missions on the San Gabriel (then called San Xavier) river for the Tonkawa.  In 1758, the Tonkawa joined with the Comanches, Wichita, Caddo and others in a raid on the Apaches at the San Saba Mission, killing thirty-five people and burning the mission.  Following this raid, the Spanish treated the Tonkawa as enemies, even conspiring to assasinate their chief, an Apache captive named El Mocho. In 1782, he traded guns to the Lipans for Spanish horses.  El Mocho hoped to lead a united Apache and Tonkawa nation, but was murdered in 1784.  Relations between the Spanish and the Tonkawa improved following his death.  
</strong></P></td></tr>
<td width=20% align=center valign=center><em>Republic of Texas</em>  </td>
<td width=75%>
<P><strong>By the early nineteenth century, the Tonkawa had allied themselves with the Apaches and the new Anglo settlers against the Comanches. Stephen F. Austin entered into a treaty with the Tonkawa in 1824.  In the 1830's and 1840's, the Tonkawa and Lipan were said to have resided between the Colorado and San Antonio rivers.  They assisted the Texas Rangers against the Comanche, Caddo and Wichita.  The Republic of Texas  concluded agreements with them in 1837 and 1838, even though they were officially considered to be natives of Mexico, not Texas.
</strong></P></td></tr>
<td width=20% align=center valign=center><em>Indian Scouts</em> </td>
<td width=75%>
<P><strong>In 1854, the United States and the State of Texas established a reservation for the Tonkawas and other tribes on the Brazos river below Fort Belknap near present day Graham.  In 1858, the Tonkawa were employed as scouts by Texas Rangers fighting Comanche and Wichita.  In 1859, they repeated this duty with the U.S. Army.  However, following attacks by Anglo settlers on the reservation, they were relocated to the Indian Territory in that same year.
</strong></P></td></tr>
<td width=20% align=center valign=center><em>Fort Griffin</em> </td>
<td width=75%>
<P><strong>During the Civil War, a group of Delaware, Shawnee, Caddo, Wichita and other tribes attacked the Tonkawa reservation in the Indian Territory, killing about half of the Tonkawans.  The survivors returned to Texas, where the Governor and the legislature donated a league of land and some supplies.  They settled near Fort Griffin and worked for the U.S. Army again until the end of the Indian Wars caused Fort Griffin to be abandoned in 1881.    
</strong></P></td></tr>
<td width=20% align=center valign=center><em>Reservation</em>  </td>
<td width=75%>
<P><strong>In 1884, they were again relocated, along with some Lipan Apaches, to the former Nez Perce reservation in the Indian Territory.  This reservation, present day home of the Tonkawa Nation, is in northern Oklahoma, near the town of Tonkawa on Interstate Highway 35.  Tribal members from the reservation attend the annual public school sponsored Powwow in November in Austin.  On the reservation, a powwow is held each June or July.
</strong></P></td></tr>
<td width=20% align=center valign=center><em>Discovery</em> </td>
<td width=75%>
<P><strong>Many Tonkawa archeological sites are known in Central Texas.  The latest was discovered northwest of Georgetown while preparing for building of the new Sun City resort.  Through an agreement with the tribe, artifacts from the site are planned for a display in the resort's visitor's center when completed.
</strong></P></td></tr>
<td width=20% align=center valign=center> <em>Extinct?</em> </td>
<td width=75%>
<P><strong>The Tonkawa language may indicate that they migrated to Texas from the northern plains.  Sadly, the only tapes of the language were buried, in a fit of grief, with the last native speaker in the 1960's.  Most, if not all, of the dances and songs of the Tonkawa have also disappeared.  One ethnologist even reported the tribe to be extinct.  Another reported, in 1951, their disappearance as a distinct tribe due to intermarriage with Lipans, other Indians and whites.  Most of the Tonkawa on the reservation live well below the poverty line.
</strong></P></td></tr>
<td width=20% align=center valign=center><em>Renewed Interest</em> </td>
<td width=75%>
<P><strong>Recently, Tonkawa descendants in the Central Texas area have attempted to organize themselves to preserve their heritage and reclaim their tribal rights.  The local Austin paper has also run a couple of articles featuring the Tonkawa.</strong>
</strong></P></td></tr>
</table>

<P>From my fingers to your eyes, this meager horde of knowledge has gone.  Be kind to it as you repeat the story around your own lodge fires and remember the Tonkawa people.  So I have said, and my story is done.

Please read the following text extracted from an "Official" memorandum

involvement in this material and the approved channels for official 
communications.

<b>Date:</b> Jun 29, 1995
<p>
<b>To:</b> Scout Executives
<p>
<b>From:</b> Jere Ratcliffe, Chief Scout Executive
<h3>Subject: Computerized Communications Networks - The INTERNET</h3>

The position of the Boy Scouts of America regarding the Internet 
is as follows:
<p>
At this time, the National Council, Boy Scouts of America, does not 
sponsor, provide or 
hold official space for disseminating information of any kind regarding 
programs, activities, 
resources of lists of names of unit leaders or chartered organizations 
on the Internet or 
other computerized communication networks.
<p>
The Boy Scouts of America disseminates information through regional 
offices and local 
councils to chartered organizations, units, leaders, and youth members.
<p>
For example, <i>Exploring</i> magazine published and distributed four 
times annually is 
the official national communications tool for unit leaders and youth 
members registered in 
the Exploring program.  Similarly, <i>Scouting</i> magazine provides a 
more generalized 
format for BSA programs and activities.
<p>
Individual units, youth, and adult members act on their own as private 
individuals and do 
not represent or serve as agents of the BSA at any time, especially when 
disseminating 
information over computerized communication networks 
(Internet, <i>etc</i>.).
<p>
At this time a National Council task force is evaluating the issue of 
alternative 
communication methods such as the Internet.  After a full and thorough 
evaluation, the 
findings of this task force will be made available to all local councils.

<h2><A NAME="q2">	What is CAC CyberBase?</A></h2> 
<blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>	A  web home for Boy Scouting in the fifteen counties served 
by the Capitol Area Council.  It contains home and additional pages for Council Cub Scout Packs, Boy Scout Troops and Explorer Posts.  We also provide a 
<A HREF="cacprl.htm"> Program Resource Library </A> for Scouts and Scouters.  The site began with an emphasis on Troop 49 information, which is still obvious today.  Sometimes this seems a little schizoid, but it works out okay.</blockquote></blockquote></strong> </P>

<h2><A NAME="q3">	When did the CyberBase site get started?</A></h2> 
<blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>	I started thinking about a home page for Troop 49 around 
March of 1995.  I began working on creating it in August and posted the 
first pages in October of 1995.  I couldn't have done this without assistance from members of the <A HREF="http://www.main.org/"> Metropolitan Austin Information Network </A> and other CyberScouting sites. </blockquote></blockquote></strong> </P>

<h2><A NAME="q4">	Why did you build it?</A></h2> 
<blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>	I believe in the value of Scouting and had been looking for a way to put some of my technical skills to use in Scouting.  My Scouting job is to provide service and support to various units (Cub Scout Packs, Boy Scout Troops, Explorer Posts and the Chartered Organizations which sponsor them).  A lot of this 
involves spreading information about Scouting programs and activities, so the idea of a web site seemed to pull together my skills and my volunteer duties.  I also hoped that such a site would be useful in contacting potential Scouting recruits. </blockquote></blockquote> </strong> </P>

<h2><A NAME="q5">	How well has it been received (usage, user stories...)?</A></h2> 
<blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>	The CyberBase homepage gets over 500 hits each month.  I get about 20 emails each week from people who have visited the site.  I’ve made contact with Scouts and Scouters from all over the world.  Many people want to find some specific Scout related information, want to trade patches or want to know how to put their unit on the Web.  Nearly everyone is nice enough to compliment me on the site, which I appreciate very much. </blockquote></blockquote></P>

<blockquote><blockquote><p>A couple of times, people have contacted me about Scouting in our area because they are moving here.  One time, I used my CyberScouting contacts to get the same information for a co-worker about Scouting in another state.  Once, a lady from 
Washington state contacted me to find out how to donate money to our Capitol Area Council.  She got a quick reply.</blockquote></blockquote></strong> </P>

<h2><A NAME="q6">	What would you do different?  What lessons have you learned?</A></h2> 
<blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>	Content and ease of access are the most important aspects of a site for potential users.</blockquote></blockquote></P>  

<blockquote><blockquote><p>Using tables of contents with cross-links at the beginning of a page facilitates navigation across and within pages.  Another navigational aid is a button bar at the top and bottom of each page that will link a visitor directly to the home page and other frequently visited pages.  A <A href="t49new.htm"> What’s New </a> page provides a good place for returning visitors if you cross link it to your updates.  An <A href="index.htm"> Index </a> page provides a good place for jumping to any of your pages.  You should also find related sites that are well visited and will maintain a pointer to your pages.  Using good title, description and keyword meta tags in the heading can greatly improve how various search engines catalog your pages. </blockquote></blockquote></P>

<blockquote><blockquote><p>Keeping graphics small and providing alternate text are important to users on slow speed links or using text based browsers.  Make the alternate text meaningful.  Likewise, avoiding many of the advanced formatting features of HTML will help browser challenged users. I have begun to use tables, however, because of the immense improvement in page layout they provide.  Most text based browsers have been updated to at least display table entrys a line at a time. Using &lt;strong&gt;  instead of &lt;b&gt;  and &lt;emphasis&gt;  instead of &lt;i&gt;  improves readability for some users and browsers. Use &lt;blockquote&gt; to indent large paragraphs of text.  </blockquote></blockquote></P>
  
<blockquote><blockquote><p>Its important to view your pages with several different browsers and video setups, because color and layout changes across browsers and workstations can detract from your page’s impact. One of the biggest mistakes made on pages is using a background that is too busy or that lacks proper contrast and makes the text of the page unreadable.  Also, playing too much with text color and fonts can be very distracting.</blockquote></blockquote></P>
  
<blockquote><blockquote><p>The second biggest mistake is to use large image maps as your 
primary navigational reference.  They load slowly and don’t provide the user any hints as to what parts of the image link to which parts of CyberSpace. </blockquote></blockquote></P>

<blockquote><blockquote><p>I am constantly searching for better ways to setup my existing 
pages.  I haven't fully implemented all of the above suggestions on all of my pages.  I am still searching for an HTML editor I like.  I have realized that maintaining a site with lots of pages takes lots of time and could be facilitated with better tools.</blockquote></blockquote></strong> </P>

<h2><A NAME="q7">	How do I find out about Scouting topic XYZ?</A></h2> 
<blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>	I usually can give some specific responses to people about where to find what they are looking for.  I often point them to our <A HREF="cacprl.htm"> Program Resource Library </A> or a site listed on our <A HREF="caclinks.htm"> Links page </A>  and to the Links page itself as a base for crawling the Web.</blockquote></blockquote></strong> </P>

<h2><A NAME="q8">	Will you trade patches with me across the net?</A></h2> <blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>	Trading patches is an old Scouting pastime.  Although I love to trade patches face to face, too many problems exist in dealing by phone, mail or Internet.  Regretfully, but with respect for the times in which we live, I decline all requests not personally presented.  I do maintain some related information and links on this <A HREF="ptchtrad.htm"> patch trading </A> page.</blockquote></blockquote></strong> </P>

<h2><A NAME="q9">	How do I get my unit on the Web?</A></h2> 
<blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>	If you are in the Capitol Area Council, it would be possible for you to post your unit’s page(s) on our server.  We'd be glad to have you.  The cost is the time and effort ya'll put into it.  If you post static information, the upkeep is minimal.  If you post calendar or newsletter information, someone must regularly 
update it.  If you create your unit page(s) under your own account on any other server, I would be happy to provide a link to them. I'll need to know the URL and what district you're in. </blockquote></blockquote></P>

<blockquote><blockquote><p>Our server space (within reason) is provided as a community 
service by the members and sponsors of the <A HREF="http://www.main.org/"> Metropolitan Austin Interactive Network</a>(MAIN).  MAIN is a not-for-profit volunteer organization utilizing donated resources to maintain our web site.  We have over 300 community organizations represented.  I have volunteered to coordinate Boy Scout related information on MAIN. If you are accessing this page from a library in Central Texas, you're probably using a workstation installed as part of MAIN's cooperative projects with Austin Free-Net and others.</blockquote></blockquote></P>
 
<blockquote><blockquote><p>I personally maintain three units' info and most of the general stuff, but other people (both Scouts and Scouters) have provided text for some of the pages or serve as WebMaster for their own unit(s) on our site.  I have links to other district and unit pages maintained by other WebMasters on other sites.  If you choose to post your pages here, I would ask for you to appoint one person as my primary contact.  </blockquote></blockquote></P>

<blockquote><blockquote><p>The last thing you need to worry about is the technical details. This stuff (HTML) is easy.  I can help you by formatting text you provide or point you to where you can learn it all for yourself (my preferred option, see next answer).</blockquote></blockquote></strong> </P>

<h2><A NAME="q10">How do I create a Web page for my unit?</A> </h2>
<blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>	First, decide what information you want to publish on your page.  I suggest starting with the basic information about your unit that you would want to give a prospective new Scout and his parents.  Think of it as a short introduction and advertisement for your unit.  Keep it simple and straightforward for your first efforts.  Provide contact and/or meeting information so someone will know how to find you.  An activities calendar will let people know about the kinds of fun things your unit does.  I recommend that you not publish the full names, phone numbers or addresses of any of the Scouts or Scouters in your unit.  There are unsavory characters lurking on the shoulders of the information highway who might misuse that information. </blockquote></blockquote></P>

<blockquote><blockquote><p>If you visit our <A HREF="caclinks.htm"> links page </A> you will be able to jump to several sites that use and provide Scout graphics and neat page examples.  If your Web browser supports it, you can do a right mouse button click on any graphic or page displayed and save it locally.  Sometimes you do this from your file menu to save a page.  Otherwise, you'll have to find sites with files setup for downloading.  The Troop 24 site in Berkeley is one such site. </blockquote></blockquote></P>

<blockquote><blockquote><p>Once you have saved a page, you can then use any standard ASCII text editor or word processor to modify it to fit your needs.  You can insert, cut and paste as needed and avoid reinventing the wheel.  There are also specialized editors for HTML, but they are not required, as you can learn the standard set of labels easily from the examples and a good book.  One such book is "Cool Web Pages", although it is already slightly out of date.  It does have a sample editor/browser and files on a disk as well.  Also, check out the <a href="#q6">What I've learned</a> info above. </blockquote></blockquote></P>
  
<blockquote><blockquote><p>If you visit the <A HREF="http://www.main.org"> MAIN page</A>, you will find a pointer to our information on publishing your organization on our site.  It has some good basic info about keeping things simple and avoiding certain HTML extensions, like tables.  A little hunting around on the Web will find lots more info on HTML and web publishing. </blockquote></blockquote></P>

<blockquote><blockquote><p>Just as on our pages, you may include a mailto: reference in any page you publish to get replies/inquiries to your unit Webmaster.  You can also include link references to any website within your pages.  However, our site does not currently support forms or scripting within your pages.  We cannot provide you with email or ftp services as of yet, either.</blockquote></blockquote></strong> </P>

<H1>Excerpts from the <BR>
Annual Report<BR>
Nineteen Hundred and Ninety-Five</H1>

<H4>Capitol Area Council, Boy Scouts of America</H4>

<H2>Message from the President</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Boy Scouts of America must be the youngest-looking and acting
old-timer in the country.  The calendar tells us we turned 85
on February 8, 1995 but we show no signs of slowing down or losing
our enthusiasm for serving youth.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Thousands of Capitol Area Council volunteer adult leaders remain
as dedicated to the missioun of the Boy Scouts of America as Scouting's
founder were in 1910.  And that mission - to help instill in young
people values based on those in the Scout Oath and Law - has not
changed in more than eight and a half decades.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Boy Scouts of America's mission has had an important place
in the lives of more than 90 million registered youth over our
85 years.  They represent the values found in the Scout Oath:
 Duty to God, to country, to others and to self.  And today's
often-heard call for a return to ethical behavior, self-reliance,
and caring and concern for others refers precisely to the values
expressed in the Scout Law, the bedrock of our movement since
1910.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
During the past 85 years, Scouting has become a household word
because of the effective way our values-driven program uses methods,
like outdoor activities, the patrol system, and an advancement
program, to accomplish our mission.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the following pages we hope to provide you with a better understanding
of our dedication and accomplishments in serving the youth of
Central Texas.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The tradition of Scouting is set.  Its success documented.  We
will continue our efforts to provide youth with values which will
last a lifetime.

<H2>Membership</H2>

<P>
The Capitol Area Council provides programs that give our youths
the experience that instills values, develops physical and mental
fitness, and helps open a new social and cultural awareness. 
Scouting offers both unique opportunities and adventure in a framework
where a child can grow in moral strength and character and become
physically, mentally, and morally fit while having fun.

<H2>Unit Service</H2>

<P>
The Commisioner is the &quot;quality control&quot; arm of Scouting
and is charged with the responsibility of assuring that the program
delivers everything young people expect when they join.  Through
monthly visits, informal coaching sessions and frequent interaction
with units, 113 trained Commissioners provided valuable support
and assistance at the unit level.
<P>
A special thanks goes to the men and women who serve as Commissioners
because they are charged with managing unit service to the 412
units in our council.  Highlights of 1995 include:
<UL>
<LI>95% of the units rechartered to serve youths for another year
<LI>60% of the units earned the coveted Quality Unit Award
<LI>Successful College of Commissioner Science
<LI>Camp Commissioners served at Lost Pines Scout Reservation.

<H2>Program/Activities</H2>

<P>
This year thousands of Scouts and leaders participated in several
activities, such as Expo, District Camporees, and weekend camping
trips.
<P>
The purpose of the Scouting program has been and always will be
to develop activities that provide an opportunity for building
and strengthening mind and body, devleoping leadership skills,
providing citizenship training, and building character.  We want
to say thanks to all the Scouts and Leaders who helped make this
a special year.  Some additional highlights of 1995 include:
<UL>
<LI>Over 6,000 Youth members participated in Expo
<LI>Over 1,500 Cub Scouts participated in Fall Festival at Lost
Pines Scout Reservation
<LI>Over 3,000 Cubs and Scouts participated in District Camporees
<LI>The Council's Annual Recognition Dinner was held in February,
featuring presentation of special recognitions to volunteers for
their service in the Capitol Area Council.

<H2>Advancement</H2>

<P>
Scouting allows each youth member the opportunity to progress
at his own pace, choosing the options that are recognized for
each achievement which helps build self-confidence, self-reliance,
and a sense of responsibility.  Advancement highlights for 1995
include:
<UL>
<LI>Over 95% of all Cub Scouts advanced one or more ranks.
<LI>Over 64% of all Boy Scouts earned at least one rank.
<LI>153 Boy Scouts earned the rank of Eagle (Scouting's highest
rank).
<LI>Scouts earned a total of 10,626 merit badges.

<H2>Training</H2>

<P>
Providing adequate training to our leaders is vital to the continued
success of our programs.  Over 72.5% of the units' top leaders
(Cubmasters, Scoutmasters, Varsity Coaches &amp; Explorer Advisors)
have completed basic training.  Other training highlights of 1995
include:
<UL>
<LI>Over 110 attended the Council's Cub Scout Leaders Pow Wow.
<LI>Over 52 Boy Scouts attended Junior Leader Training at Camp
Green Dickson.
<LI>Youth Protection Training was held in each district.
<LI>Cub Scout Basic Training and Scoutmaster Fundamentals were
held in each district.
<LI>63 Scout Leaders attended Wood Badge Training.

<H2>Camping</H2>

<P>
Through the tireless efforts of committed volunteers, the Council
provides a unique opportunity for thousands of youth each year
to learn and develop leadership skills in an educational outdoor
setting.  Away from home, faced with the challenge of becoming
more self-reliant, youths will inevitably find some strengths
such as problem solving, team work, leadership and inter-personal
skills.  Council camp highlights include:
<UL>
<LI>Over 1,182 Cub Scouts attended one of the eight Day Camps
available.
<LI>Over 973 Cub Scouts attended Cub Resident Camp at the Horse
Center.
<LI>2,327 Boy Scouts attended summer camp at Lost Pines Scout
Reservation.
<LI>An additional 427 Capitol Area Council Boy Scouts attended
other long term camps.
<LI>594 Boy Scouts attended BSA High Adventure Bases such as Philmont
in New Mexico.
<LI>5 Boy Scouts attended the World Jamboree.
<LI>392 Boy Scouts attended Winter Camp at Lost Pines.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Description of Brentwood Neighborhood Association</H1>
<HR>
<P>Brentwood Neighborhood Association serves North Central Austin, Texas.
The boundaries are Justin Lane (North), 45th Street (South), 
North Lamar Blvd. (East), and Burnet Road (West).

<P>BNA is bisected by Koenig Lane into North Brentwood and Baja Brentwood.
We support widening Koenig Lane into a boulevard with trees planted in
the median.  We oppose expansion of Koenig Lane into a freeway because 
it would sound a death knell for our beloved neighborhood.

<P>The following major facilities are located within the boundaries
of BNA:
<UL>
<LI>McCallum High School
<LI>Brentwood Elementary School
<LI>Austin Community Gardens
<LI>Texas Department of Health
<LI>Texas Rehabilitation Commission
<LI>Texas Youth Commission
<LI>Texas Commission for the Blind

<title>Prenatal Education Program (PEP)</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Prenatal Education Program (PEP)</h1>


<h3><i>Program Description</i></h3><p>
	The Prenatal Education Program (PEP) provides important health education and support to pregnant teens and women in Austin and the surrounding community.  <p>

	Since 1989, CEDEN's PEP has pursued the goal  of reducing the incidence of prematurity, low birth weight, and other birth-related problems attributable to poor prenatal education and care.<p>

<h3><i>Eligibility</i></h3><p>
	PEP serves pregnant women who are at high risk of having problematic pregnancy outcomes.  These include pregnant teens, low-income women, single women, women with histories of active substance abuse or family violence, women with few job skills or little education, and women who lack social support.<p>

	The eligibility for the Prenatal Education Program is as follows:<p>
<ul>		
<li>  First-time mothers or women with high risk (as mentioned above).
<li>  Residents of Travis or Williamson Counties.
<li>  Women at less than 25 weeks gestation preferred.<p>
</ul>

<h3><i>Home-Based Program Services</i></h3><p>

A Case Manager is assigned to every expectant mother, and provides the following services:<p>
<ul>
<li>  Schedules the initial registration visit, 
<li>  Informs the participant about PEP services, 
<li>  Assesses prenatal risk status to determine whether the mother would be best served by a volunteer or staff member, and 
<li>  Provides services to locate transportation, housing, educational programs, clinic services, child care for siblings, etc. </ul>  

Once a PEP participant is registered in the program, depending on the level of need, a Volunteer Prenatal Educator (VPE) or a Case Manager is selected for the participant.  The VPE or Case Manager provides the following core services:<p>

<ul>
<li>  Four educational home visits before delivery, ideally beginning during the first trimester;
<li>  One visit during the hospital stay or soon thereafter, including delivery of a layette, containing essential new baby-care items, as a gift to the new mother and baby; and
<li>  Up to three postnatal home visits, including presentation of CEDEN's infant development book, a newborn assessment for mental or physical delays, and child development information.
</ul>

Each VPE receives eight hours of intensive on-site training and a Volunteer Training Manual.  The volunteers provide rich educational opportunities and ensure essential support during the prenatal period.  Volunteers may visit with the pregnant teens and women more often than the basic program requires.  They access complementary information from PEP's video library and share additional educational materials written by CEDEN or others.<p>

VPEs are trained to encourage each participant to enroll in childbirth classes in hospital and clinic settings, to schedule and keep medical appointments, to understand the important role nutrition plays in the health of her family, and to refrain from using drugs, alcohol or tobacco during pregnancy or while nursing her baby.  The volunteers also help mothers become knowledgeable about community resources and empower mothers to become more self-sufficient and secure in their roles as parents.<p>

VPEs are a very special and committed group of women from Austin and the surrounding area.  They are ethnically representative of the participants PEP serves.  (For additional information, please see the Volunteer Services Chapter in this Annual Report.)<p>

<h3><i>Center-Based Educational Classes</i></h3><p>

The Prenatal Education Program also provides center-based Birthing Classes, and Car and Home Safety Classes.  These two classes are offered monthly, at no charge, for the greater Austin community as well as for PEP participants. <p>

CEDEN's Birthing Classes teach expectant mothers how to prepare for labor and delivery.  The classes review stages of labor, birthing terminology, and what to expect at the hospital.  In addition, breathing and relaxation techniques are taught and practiced.  The participants complete their sessions feeling more knowledgeable and confident about their ability to cope with labor and delivery.<p>

CEDEN's Car and Home Safety Classes help to prevent infant injury.  Through joint efforts with the Austin/Travis County and Texas Health Departments, CEDEN loans car seats to program families and to the general community.  Families must attend the Car and Home Safety Class before they receive a car seat.  <p>

<h3><i>Program Staff</i></h3><p>

The PEP staff consists of a Coordinator/Case Manager, three part-time Case Managers, one full-time Case Manager, and invaluable Volunteer Prenatal Educators.  All staff engage in regular outreach activities to recruit program participants.  These activities include making presentations to the staff of hospitals, schools, and social service agencies.<p>

<title>Parent-Child Program : Early Childhood Intervention (ECI) Services</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Parent-Child Program<br>
Early Childhood Intervention (ECI) Services</h1>

<h3><i>Program Description</i></h3>

The Parent-Child Program, ECI Services is affiliated with The Early Childhood Intervention Program of Texas.  This program was created by the State's 67th Legislature to provide services to children with severe developmental delays.  Texas was one of the first states to legislate early childhood intervention services for infants and toddlers with developmental delays.<p>

CEDEN's Parent-Child Program: ECI Services seeks to accomplish the following goals:

<ul>
<li>Conduct comprehensive assessments of children's developmental abilities and health status;
<li>Improve children's developmental status;
<li>Keep infants up-to-date in their immunizations;
<li>Monitor children's nutritional status;
<li>Help parents access social, educational, medical, and other resources they might need;
<li>Improve home safety and parenting skills, when needed, and
<li>Prevent childhood injuries and abuse.
</ul>

<h3><i>Eligibility</i></h3>

As established by Texas ECI policies, a child is eligible to participate in CEDEN's Parent-Child (ECI) program if s/he:

<ul>
<li>Is notably delayed in one or more areas of child development including perceptual, fine motor, gross motor, language, cognitive, emotional, and/or self-help skills, according to a standardized infant development scale (the degree of delay required by ECI is age dependent), or
<li>Has been diagnosed by a physician to have an illness or medical condition that has a high probability of resulting in a developmental delay; or
<li>Has been determined to have an atypical condition or behavior for his or her age by a qualified therapist or professional.
</ul>

Children, ages newborn to 36 months, who qualify according to the above-stated criteria are allowed to continue in the program as long as they remain eligible.  Assessments are conducted every six months to evaluate a child's developmental status.  According to federal and state rules, when an ECI child is three years old and still needs services, s/he is to be transitioned to a school district to be served by the special education program for this age level.  <p>

<h3><i>Program Services</i></h3>

CEDEN's ECI program provides a range of services to its clients and their families.  Home visits, weekly language groups (in English and Spanish), monthly group meetings and on-going evaluation of children enable ECI staff to meet the various needs of clients and their families.   In 1994, CEDEN ECI services held a total of 10 group meetings, which ranged from Back-to-School Bingo to a demonstration on Healthy Snacks.  In addition to these services, ECI also provided individual physical and occupational therapy sessions to 39 children.<p>

Services are provided by a highly-qualified staff of Early Intervention Specialists, as well as Speech, Occupational and Physical Therapists.  These staff work with the family as a team to ensure that all of the child's developmental needs are addressed. <p>

<title>Teen Parent Program (TPP)</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Teen Parent Program (TPP)</h1>


<h3><i>Program Description</i></h3>

The CEDEN Teen Parent Program (TPP) provides parenting education and child development resources to teenage parents who reside in Del Valle, Texas.  The TPP staff work closely with the Del Valle Independent School District (DVISD) Teaching, Learning, Caring (TLC) program to provide home visits, referrals and resource information to students or teens who are no longer in school.  TPP staff also work closely with the Even Start Family Literacy Program in an effort to re-enroll students in its DVISD school program.<p>

The Teen Parent Program seeks to accomplish the following goals:

<ul>
<li> Improve parenting skills;
<li> Improve child development;
<li> Re-enroll teens in appropriate school programs, when necessary;
<li> Help young parents attain self-sufficiency;
<li> Assist families experiencing crises, and  
<li> Reduce the number of repeat teen pregnancies.
</ul>

<h3><i>Eligibility</i></h3>

The criteria for parent eligibility in the Teen Parent Program include:

<ul>
<li> Women less than 20 years of age;
<li> Parent of a child newborn to five years of age, and
<li> Resident of Del Valle, Texas.
</ul>

<h3><i>Program Services</i></h3>

Teen Parent Program services include:
<ul>
<li> Weekly or biweekly home-visits for teens, their children and extended family members;
<li> Child development assessments;
<li> Individualized Family Service Plans;
<li> Family advocacy and case management, as needed; and
<li> Referrals to CEDEN's Prenatal Education Program and Parenting Classes. 
</ul>

In collaboration with the TLC program, students receive free child care, transportation, competency-based secondary education, computer training, cooperative summer school and work arrangements, and General Equivalency Diploma (GED) classes.  This is the only program that serves out-of-school teens in Del Valle, and it is the only program that serves parenting teens in their homes.  This is especially important because Del Valle is a rural area and many teens do not drive or have access to public transportation.  These teens can receive case management, referrals, and assistance with access to community resources.  This extra effort places several teens back in school or job training each year.  Teen Parent Program services are provided by the Program Coordinator/Home Parent Educator who serves up to 20 teens at one time.<p>

<h1>Even Start Family Literacy Program</h1>


<h3><i>Program Description</i></h3>

The Even Start Family Literacy Program is a federally-funded initiative administered by the Texas Education Agency.  The program links home and school-based parent education, academic education and child development education to secure a solid foundation for family self-sufficiency and positive community involvement.<p>

As a subcontractor to the Del Valle Independent School District (DVISD), CEDEN provides educational home visits, on-site parenting classes and parent and child care resources for families enrolled in the Even Start Family Literacy Program. The district provides the school-based academic instructors, child care providers and all classroom, office and child care facilities which house CEDEN and school district staff.  The district also provides transportation and free lunches to the majority of adult participants and their pre-school age children (newborn to 4 years).  Together, the district and CEDEN provide the services required of the nationally known Even Start Family Literacy Program.<p>

CEDEN's Even Start Family Literacy Program goals are to:

<ul>
<li>Improve child development;
<li>Prevent and reverse developmental delays;

CEDEN's Even Start services are provided by the Program Coordinator, a Parenting Class Teacher, and two Home Parent Educators.  Home visiting staff are extremely flexible in providing services to their families since many parents participate in school-based services on weekdays, between 8:00 and 2:30.<p>

<title>Parent-Child Program:  Child Development and Family Services</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Parent-Child Program:<br>
Child Development and Family Services</h1>

<h3><i>Program Description</i></h3>

The Parent-Child Program: Child Development (CD) and Family Services (FS) provides home and center-based parenting and child development education to families in Travis and Williamson Counties.  Child Development home visiting services are administered from CEDEN's North Lamar office.  Family Services are provided through the North Lamar office, and from the Seton Northwest Teen Parent Center.  In November, the latter facility was closed, and the program relocated to the Seton Good Health School.  Referrals are received at all sites and community response continues to be positive to the programs' proactive, parent-empowering approach.<p>

<h3><i>Child Development Services</i></h3>

The Child Development program serves families whose children are delayed but do not meet the strict eligibility requirements for ECI services.  Without services, these delays often worsen and become more difficult to reverse.  Intensive services are also provided to families where biological (e.g. prematurity, low birth weight, or malnutrition), socioeconomic (e.g. poverty or homelessness) or familial factors (e.g. mother 17 years or younger, low level of formal education, and social isolation) may inhibit adequate growth and parenting.<p>
	
The goals of Child Development Services are to:
<ul>
<li>Reverse or prevent developmental delays;
<li>Prevent child abuse and neglect; 
<li>Improve parenting skills: 
<li>Improve child health care and nutritional status: and
<li>Help parents achieve self-sufficiency.
</ul>

<h3><i>Child Development Eligibility</i></h3>

Those eligible for CD services include:

<ul>
<li>Parents of any age;
<li>Children newborn to age three;
<li>Moderately or mildly delayed children ineligible for ECI services, or 
<li>Children at risk for delay, abuse or neglect due to biological, socioeconomic or familial factors.
</ul>

<h3><i>Program Services</i></h3>

The following services are provided by CD staff:
<ul>
<li>Individualized weekly or biweekly home visits focusing on infant stimulation, child development, health, nutrition, safety, home improvement, self-sufficiency;
<li>Screenings and assessments;
<li>Individualized Family Service Plans;
<li>Center-based activities and groups, and
<li>Case management and family advocacy, as needed.
</ul>

<h3><i>Family Services</i></h3>

The Parent Child Program: Family Services assists parents whose children are generally developmentally on target, but would benefit from parenting and child development education to prevent future delays, abuse, and neglect.  Monthly home visits are conducted by trained and supervised Volunteer Parent Educators or AmeriCorps Volunteers.  Each month, the families receive appropriate developmental and educational materials.  <p>

The goals of Family Services are to:
<ul>
<li>Prevent the onset of developmental delays;
<li>Prevent child abuse and neglect;
<li>Enhance parenting skills, and
<li>Provide case management services and family advocacy, as needed.<p>
</ul>

<h3><i>Family Services Eligibility</i></h3>

Those eligible for FS services include:
<ul>
<li>Parents of any age;
<li>Children newborn to age three;
<li>Children with age-appropriate development;
<li>Children at very low risk of abuse or neglect, and
<li>Families in the greater Austin area, Round Rock, Cedar Park, Georgetown, and Taylor.
</ul>

<h3><i>Program Services</i></h3>

The following services are provided by the FS Program:

<ul>
<li>Screenings, assessments, and program interviews conducted by Case Managers;
<li>Family Service Plans;
<li>Monthly home visits utilizing core educational materials on child development, health, nutrition, safety, home improvement and self-sufficiency;
<li>Toy making packets for developmentally appropriate projects, and
<li>Case management and family advocacy. 
</ul>

FS services are provided by one full-time and one half-time professional Case Manager, trained Volunteer Parent Educators and AmeriCorps Volunteers.  Volunteers receive seven hours of pre-service training on using CEDEN's educational materials, making home visits, and accessing community resources to enhance existing family skills.  In September, 1994, two AmeriCorp Volunteers (one full-time and one half-time) were added to the program staff.  This has enabled the program to serve many more families.<p>

<h3><i>Program Summary</i></h3>

Thanks to a grant from the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC)/Goal One Project, CEDEN was funded in 1992, to conduct this 36-month pilot project of child development and parenting education services to families with moderately delayed and/or high-risk children.  Experience with the project has shown that there is a significant need for services to this overlooked population.  Many children who had moderate delays when they entered the program were developmentally on-target by exit.  CEDEN staff expect that these children will not need costly special education services when they enter elementary school.  <p>

The NAEYC funding will end in April, 1995, and future funding for the program is of prime concern.  One half-time Family Development Specialist will continue to provide Child Development Services in 1995 thanks to a grant from IBM/United Way.  However, there is a tremendous need for more Child Development services in Austin, and CEDEN staff are continuing to seek additional funding for the program.  (CEDEN is the only agency in Austin providing services to these families; and at any given time during 1994, approximately 80 families were waiting to be assessed for services.)  <p>

<title>Healthy and Fair Start  (H&FS) Program for Southeast Austin</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Healthy and Fair Start  (H&amp;FS) Program for Southeast Austin</h1>



<h3><i>Program Description</i></h3>

	CEDEN's newest program, The Healthy &amp; Fair Start (H&amp;FS) Program was established in February, 1994.  This program is part of a collaborative project sponsored by the City of Austin and Travis County in response to a comprehensive needs assessment spearheaded by the Hogg Foundation School of the Future Project and the Southeast Corner Alliance of Neighborhoods (SCAN) organization.  CEDEN is funded to provide a continuum of services (from the prenatal period to the child's enrollment in elementary school) to families residing in Southeast Austin (zip code 78744).<p>

	The H&amp;FS Program is modeled on Hawaii's Healthy Start Program and on CEDEN's Fair Start (Parent-Child) Program, and provides both home and center-based services to families in Southeast Austin.  Home-based services include CEDEN's Prenatal Education, Early Childhood Intervention, Child Development and Family Services components.  Center-based services include Parenting Classes and Support Groups, the Resource Room/Toy Lending Library, and training for child care providers.<p>

<h2><i>Home-Based Services</i></h2>

<h3><i>Prenatal Education Program</i></h3>

	The H&amp;FS prenatal component provides the same services as CEDEN's larger Prenatal Education Program (PEP).  Pregnant women of all ages and income levels are eligible for H&amp;FS prenatal education services.  However, program participants must be residents of Southeast Austin (zip code 78744).<p>

	The Prenatal Educator/Case Manager provides educational home visits to pregnant women who are at high risk of developing prenatal complications.  She also supervises many volunteers who work with women at lower risk.  Birthing classes, Car and Home Safety Classes, and Volunteer Training are held at the H&amp;FS Program office.  <p>

<h3><i>Early Childhood Intervention (ECI) Services</i></h3>

	Children with severe developmental delays receive Early Childhood Intervention (ECI) Services from CEDEN's ECI staff, housed at the East 7th Street office.  However, ECI families living in Southeast Austin are also eligible for H&amp;FS center-based services.  Siblings of these children may receive other home-based services, if eligible.   <p>

<h3><i>Child Development (CD) and Family Services (FS)</i></h3>

	As noted in earlier sections of this annual report, Child Development (CD) Services are provided for children who are developmentally delayed but do not meet the strict eligibility requirements of ECI Services.  Family Services (FS) are provided for children who are not delayed, but whose families would benefit from services to prevent future delays, abuse and neglect.  <p>

	The Healthy &amp; Fair Start Program's professional Home Parent Educators provide the range of CD and FS Services to eligible families in Southeast Austin. In addition, one AmeriCorps Volunteer and many Volunteer Parent Educators provide the less intensive Family Services.  When families with children under age three no longer require the services of professional staff, families are then transferred to trained Volunteer Parent Educators or the AmeriCorps Volunteer.  These volunteers continue to provide services using CEDEN's Growing and Learning (0-36 month) Curriculum.  Since September, 1994 the AmeriCorps Volunteer has helped to reduce Home Parent Educators' case loads by serving FS families.  This has allowed the Home Parent Educators to serve more families with intense needs.  <p>


<h2><i>Center-Based Services and Activities</i></h2>

<h3><i>Parenting Classes and Support Groups</i></h3>

	Parents are encouraged to attend group meetings and activities in order to receive parenting education and child development information in a different setting (outside their homes), to meet families like their own, to build new friendships and to reduce social isolation.  Child Care is provided during class times.<p>

	The goals of Parenting Classes and Support Groups are to:  help parents understand the ages and stages of child development; improve parenting skills; prevent and reduce child abuse and neglect; increase support to parents and reduce parental stress and isolation.<p>

	Parents or relatives of children of any age are eligible for Parenting Classes and Support Groups as long as they live in Southeast Austin (zip code 78744).  English-language classes and groups are planned and held by the Resource Room Coordinator.  A Spanish-language Parenting Class/ Support Group is provided in collaboration with Pathways.  The Pathways Southeast Austin Counselor conducts this class with assistance from CEDEN's Spanish-speaking Home Parent Educator.  Until this partnership was formed, there had been no support group for Spanish-speaking families in the neighborhood.<p>

	Most parenting classes and support groups were held at CEDEN's Resource Room and several others were provided in collaboration with Widen Elementary School and the Teenage Parent Council.  The parents who are involved in these groups are very dedicated to supporting one another and learning about their children; they encourage each other to attend classes and try to find new members.  <p>

<h3><i>Resource Room/Toy Lending Library (RR/TLL)</i></h3>

	The Resource Room/Toy Lending Library (RR/TLL) is the home of hundreds of resources and educational materials for parents and educators.  Many of the books cover topics from infancy to late adolescence. Developmentally appropriate toys are available from infancy to five years of age. <p>

	The goals of the RR/TLL are to:  provide educational materials to families and child care providers who would otherwise not have any; teach parents how to choose and care for educational materials; expose children to new materials; identify unregistered child care providers and help them to obtain registration; and provide a place where parents and providers are comfortable and can ask any kind of question.<p>

	The Resource Room/Toy Lending Library (RR/TLL) is available to all parents and child care providers who live, work, or have a child care facility in the 78744 zip code area.  The Resource Room is increasingly used by families and child care providers for informational and educational resources.  A major accomplishment for the Toy Lending Library is that it is now computerized!  The Resource Room Coordinator is easily able to check which materials are available and which families may have books or toys checked out.<p>

<h3><i>Training Sessions for Child Care Providers</i></h3>

	Training sessions for child care providers in Southeast Austin are important because many neighborhood providers are unregistered and do not have the training or materials they need.  Classes or sessions provide the training that will enable providers to acquire information and training to become registered or to improve their knowledge of child development and issues related to early childhood education. <p>

	Goals for training are to:  identify registered and unregistered child care providers; help unregistered child care providers become registered; enhance family child care homes by providing information on child development, early childhood education, home safety and related topics;  and work in collaboration with other trainers to provide classes in Southeast Austin.<p>

	Training is available for all child care providers (or those who are training to become child care providers) who live, work, or have a child care facility in the 78744 zip code.  (This requirement is sometimes waived depending on class size and who is teaching.)<p>

<body>

<h1>Volunteer Services</h1>


<h3><i>Program Description</i></h3>

	The purpose of CEDEN's Volunteer Services is to identify, recruit and enroll volunteers for Prenatal Education, Family Services and other programs.  <p>

<h3><i>Volunteer Eligibility</i></h3>

	CEDEN's volunteers range in age from school-age children to grandparents.  The majority provide home-based services for the Prenatal and Family Services Programs.  These Volunteer Prenatal or Parent Educators are high school graduates who are requested to:

<ul>
<li>Complete a telephone interview;
<li>Submit three personal references;
<li>Complete an application form, and 
<li>Attend volunteer training.
</ul>

	Volunteers receive continued support from the Case Managers who call monthly to answer questions, monitor the client's progress, and offer assistance when needed.<p>

<h3><i>Volunteer Services Provided</i></h3>

	CEDEN has used volunteers effectively since its inception in 1979.  In our Prenatal Education Program, Volunteer Prenatal Educators provide educational home and hospital visits to high risk pregnant teens and women, and help reduce rates of low birth weight, premature and preventable delay.  Volunteer Parent Educators provide monthly child development and parenting education to families in our Family Services program.  Volunteers are tutors and teachers in our Family Learning Center, the all-day Saturday family literacy program.  They also donate baby items, clothing, furniture, toys, and food for our Food Pantry.  Many volunteers adopt a family for the holidays and provide a meal, gifts for the children, clothing and household items.<p>

	In addition to individual volunteers, corporations, churches, and organizations have also generously donated money and materials to support several of CEDEN's projects.  Their employees have also given of their time to assist in providing services.  This included the donation of money or materials, such as the items included in the United Way Day of Caring home safety kits and the Prenatal Program layettes.  Food was donated for many of our special events including the Volunteer Recognition, the Poinsettia Tea, Dove Springs Thanksgiving Dinner, and the Saturday Learning Center.  The employees donated their time by participating in projects such as the organizing and hosting of the Halloween Picnic, the United Way Day of Caring, and the ECI (Early Childhood Intervention) Graduation and Christmas Parties.<p>

	Listed below are a few of the many projects that Volunteers have assisted with in 1994:<p>

<b>Group Projects</b>
<pre>	Valentine's Party		Annual Back-to-School Picnic
	Kite Making Party		Halloween Party	
	Easter Egg Hunt		        Poinsettia Party	
	Annual City-Wide Baby Shower    Christmas Party	
	Play Day at Zilker Park		Adopt-A-Family	
	Back-to-School Packets		Food Pantry
	Graduation Celebration		Family Literacy Program
	Bulk Mailings	                Manual Updates/Revisions
</pre>
   
<b>Individual Projects</b>
<pre>	Family Literacy Program	          Special Activities Assistants
	Volunteer Prenatal Educators	  Child Care Assistants
	Volunteer Parent Educators 	  Library Assistant
</pre>

<h3><i>Volunteer Services Staff</i></h3>

Volunteer Services consists of a half-time Volunteer Coordinator, who provides volunteers for all of CEDEN's programs and services, and places highest priority on the following:

<ul>
<li>Recruiting and selecting Volunteer Prenatal and Parent Educators (VPE's);
<li>Coordinating the dates and times for Volunteer training;
<li>Assisting in the recruitment and selection of Volunteers for the Family Learning Resource Center
<li>Coordinating the Volunteer recognition event.
</ul>

	The volunteer recruitment effort is broadly-based and includes working with the United Way, The University of Texas, Austin Community College, Austin Volunteer Center, DOVIA (Director of Volunteers in Austin), RSVP (Retired and Senior Volunteer Program), and Austin Cable TV.  Exhibits have also been provided at many volunteer fairs and meetings at corporations, churches, and in the community.  Information about training sessions and volunteer needs are submitted regularly to newspapers, and radio and television stations in Travis and Williamson counties.<p>

	In honor of CEDEN volunteers, a reception was held in May at the Caswell House.  The use of this beautiful mansion was donated by the Junior League and food was donated by area businesses and dedicated volunteers.  Ms. Luci Baines Johnson, the guest speaker, recognized all of CEDEN volunteers by presenting plaques to the four Volunteers of the Year, letters from Governor Ann Richards to the Distinguished Volunteers, and certificates to the Honored Volunteers.  All present also received a CEDEN coffee mug.<p>

<h1>Educational Materials</h1>


<h3><i>Program Description</i></h3>

	CEDEN's educational materials help to support the core services provided to families by supplying information which assists clients to become healthier and more self-sufficient.  The Coordinator of Educational Materials prepares educational packets, booklets and other resource materials which help staff members and volunteers present information to parents on child development, parenting, health, nutrition, budgeting, organizational skills, etc.  In addition, the coordinator participates in a variety of other activities.<p>

<h3><i>Program Accomplishments</i></h3>

In 1994, the following activities took place:

<ul>
<li>A guide to Austin-area resources was compiled and nearly completed by the end of the year.  Entitled Austin-Area Opportunities and Resources for GROWTH, the book will be given to CEDEN program families and case managers.  Additional copies will be available for sale to the general public.
<li>A spring edition of the newsletter, CEDEN Communicator, was created and mailed to thousands of individuals, families and organizations.
<li>Six bimonthly, bilingual newsletter/calendars were created for CEDEN program families.  Growing and Learning Together was distributed to over 1,000 addresses, including program families, clinics, schools and other social service agencies.  Fiesta Mart, Inc. graciously donated funds for the printing and distribution of some of these issues.
<li>The child development section of Growing and Learning:  Newborn to 36 Months, curriculum for the Parent-Child Program: Family Services, was bound separately into a book and entitled Growing and Learning: Newborn to 36 Months --A Monthly Child Development Guide.  This action was taken in response to requests for materials from individuals and various programs desiring educational materials without program replication. 
<li>The Coordinator gave presentations to the HOMESPUN Conference in San Marcos, the Children's Trust Fund Conference in Austin and the Texas Early Childhood Intervention (ECI) Program Conference in Austin. </ul>

<h3><i>Summary</i></h3>

	In the near future, the Educational Materials Coordinator will be completing Growing and Learning: 37 to 60 Months; a curriculum for staff and Volunteer Parent Educators to use on monthly home visits.   Other projects will be designed to reflect the needs of CEDEN staff and their program families.<p>

<h1>Research and Evaluation</h1>


<h3><i>Program Description</i></h3>

	The primary role of the Research and Evaluation department is to plan evaluation designs, evaluate program outcomes, maintain a state-of-the art database system, train personnel in data collection techniques, prepare external reports to funders and other interested persons, and provide internal reports to Program Coordinators.  CEDEN is one of the few social service agencies in Austin to have an evaluation department, and it has had this department since its inception.<p>

	This Annual Report, as well as dozens of Monthly, Quarterly, Bi-Annual, and Final Progress Reports were produced for CEDEN funders throughout 1994.  They show a tremendous amount of work and information provided by direct service and support staff.  <p>

<h3><i>Evaluation Component</i></h3>

	During 1994, City and County performance measures for the Healthy and Fair Start, the Prenatal Education Program and the Early Childhood Intervention programs were revised.  The new measures better reflect CEDEN's services and impacts.  Measures for both the process-oriented Quarterly Reports and the outcome-oriented Self-Impact Evaluations of these three programs were revised and approved. <p>

	In accordance with these revisions, CEDEN's evaluation and database management system was further developed.  Changes were made to the majority of data-collection forms to more efficiently collect data needed to assess performance measures and goals; Spanish versions are also available.  Staff members were trained on how to use the new forms, data-entry personnel received a manual developed to reduce confusion and ensure accurate and consistent data-entry techniques, and the computer system was updated to reflect all changes.<p>

	Evaluation systems were designed and installed to monitor and evaluate the new Child Care Provider Training component and the Toy Lending Library for parents and child care providers in the H&amp;FS program, as well.  Appropriate forms and telephone surveys were created along with respective computer systems for evaluation.  In addition, a computer program to monitor library use was developed. <p>

<h3><i>Database Development</i></h3>

	During the year, four 486 desktop PC's and 3 Desk jet printers were purchased for use by program coordinators and staff at the North Lamar, Southeast Austin and Central office locations. A significant achievement during the year was the installation of a database server and Novell Network.  The network allows more users to have access to the database simultaneously for database development, program monitoring or data-entry.  The network is a major accomplishment because, at the outset of 1994, six of CEDEN's programs had their own separate databases which caused family information to be compiled and reported inefficiently and duplicated unnecessarily.  Over a period of several months, these databases were merged into one large database.<p>

<h3><i>Summary</i></h3>

	Under the direction of the new Coordinator, communication and consistency between the Research and Evaluation Department and the case managers improved significantly during 1994.  More challenges remain for 1995.  A CEDEN Internal Referral Form was piloted during the early part of the year, and will be revised according to staff suggestions and finalized during this year.  Also during 1995, CEDEN plans to more systematically collect immunization records of children they serve to help ensure that they are up-to-date on all immunizations recommended by the Department of Health.  Finally, plans are being made to complete outcome-oriented reports that demonstrate impacts made by CEDEN programs.<p>

800/242-1880<BR> 800/252-3163 (fax)  </H2>
<P>The Interlibrary Loan Center (ILC) at the Austin Public Library provides
interlibrary loan service to member libraries of the Central Texas Library
System (CTLS) and to cardholders of the Austin Public Library.  This
federal/state funded program enables patrons at any CTLS member library to
request any type of library material not available at the local library.  
</P>
<P>Requests can be routed to the Austin ILC by phone, telefax, and electronic
mail.  If the material is available at the Austin Public Library or one of its
branches, ILC staff will retrieve the item and ship it to the member library via
the U.S. postal service.  Turnaround time is usually between 5-10 days for such
requests.  
</P>
<P>If the material is not available from the Austin Public Library, ILC staff
routes the request onto a nationwide interlibrary loan system called OCLC
(Online Computer Library Center).  This system includes an email request service
linked to a national union catalog containing the holdings of over 11,000
public, academic and special libraries.  Regional reciprocal agreements make &quot;no
charge&quot; borrowing possible in most cases.  Turnaround time for requests

<B>History of El Buen Samaritano Episcopal Mission <br></B>
El Buen Samaritano (EBS), established as a non-profit 501 ( c ) ( 3 )
organization in 1987, provides health and human services programs to more
than 6,000 low-income and indigent individuals a year in a predominantly
Hispanic area of Austin, Texas.  In the ten years since El Buen Samaritano
was founded, the mission has grown from a small program providing food to the
poor to a multi-faceted service center offering a variety of health and human
service programs and classes. The programs  offered reflect the mission's
dedication to serving the whole person--body, mind, and spirit--and to meeting
the needs of the community.  One of the driving philosophies behind these
services is to offer a helping hand, not a hand-out.  Dignity for the
individual and concern for families are guiding principles of EBS. <p>

<B>El Buen Samaritano Episcopal Center<br> 
Primary Service Area<br></B>
The 1990 Census figures show that El Buen Samaritano's  primary service area
which includes Zip Codes 78741, 78744, 78704 and 78745 has a total population
of <B>135,824.</B> Of those 75,752 are Anglo, 46,016 Hispanic, 10,776 African
American, and 3,280 are of other races. The annual median household income is
$17,000 per family of  four. The population under 200% poverty level for the
four Zip Codes is <B>55,986.</B><p>

<h1>El Concilio / Yale University<br>Summer Academic Fellowship</h1>
</center>

<b>Summertime.</b>  The mere word conjures up images of swimming pools and ice-cream trucks; not S.A.T. practice tests, reading comprehension exercises, and computer labs.  Yet, in a recreation center in East Austin, a group of eleven high school students are hitting the books in preparation for higher education and their futures.  <p>

This year sees the beginning of an academic summer fellowship sponsored by <b>Yale University, El Concilio (a coalition of Mexican-American neighborhood associations in East Austin)</b>, and the <b>Ciy of Austin Electric Department</b>.  The students are being led through a program of academic preparation and enhancement by two Yale students.<p>

<center><img src="concmp5.gif"></center>

The forty-hour week includes daily reading and writing exercises, visits to local research sights and workplaces, standardized test preparations, community service projects, and attendance at two national conventions on Latino issues, amongst other activities.  The group also seeks to tackle the enigmatic question of how to choose and to be admitted to a college, and how to seek the scholarships and financial aid to make that next step a reality.<p>

This program is unique in its nature for a variety of reasons.  This program targets students who have exhibited their academic potential in the classroom and who now need the extra attention that their overburdened public schools ar unable to give to them.  Additionally, the students draw an hourly wage for their time in the program and the summer duals as a job training program, with weekly performance evaluations, as well as serving as a means of academic empowerment.<p>

Already, only a month old, the program has seen positive results  The students are being exposed to more and more opportunities in higher education and the workplace.  Outside parties are showing a growing interest in the program this summer which has led to a diversity of outings and an extension of resources.  Most importantly, however, the students continue to show signs of their growth.<p>

While interested companies and individuals slowly come out of the wookdwork, the program carries on this summer in the back room of a local recreation center.  The students continue with the task at hand, and the group of fellows focuses on the remainder of the time before them to reach the groups' objectives.  However, the future of these students is not the only question on the minds of the coordinators and supporters of this program.  The seed has been planted for a hearty vine, and all that is needed now is a steady source of water and light to ensure the growth of a vine that can bear fruit for years to come.<p>

For more information on the summer academic fellowship, or to offer support, please contact <b>Gavino Fernandez</b> at <b>(512) 477-4013</b>.

<h2><a name="wanted">Wanted: Boys &amp; Their Families</a></h2>

<p>Is your son in grades 1-5? Does he like being outdoors,
camping with your family, or making crafts? Would you like to
help him have fun while learning about fitness, citizenship and
responsibility? Pack members are boys from First Cumberland or Brentwood,
Wooten, Reilly and other elementary schools. </p>

<p>First graders meet once a month in a Tiger Cub group with
their parents. They may work on crafts, visit special places,
have picnics or join the Pack for a special activity. </p>

<p>Second through Fifth graders meet in Wolf, Bear or Webelos
dens once a week, usually at the Den Leader's home, the church, a
park or other site. During our den meetings, we play games, work
on Scout skills, advancement, prepare songs or skits for the pack
meetings and have fun. For more detail, check out the <a
href="csbasics.htm">Cub Scout Basics</a> page. </p>

<p>Our pack meets at First Cumberland Presbyterian Church (6800
Woodrow Avenue, Austin, TX 78757) on the fourth Thursday of each
month at 7:00 p.m. Dens present their skits or songs, Cubs are
recognized for their advancements, and special events like the
Blue and Gold Dinner or the Pinewood Derby are held. </p>

<p>We also have scheduled family campouts or other activities
nearly every month. In the summer, we hold special activities each
month instead of our regular pack meetings. Many of our Scouts
attend day camp or resident camp, too. </p>

<h3><img src="gifs/cslogosm.gif" alt="logo" align="middle"
width="43" height="40"> What is Cub Scouting?</h3>

<p>The Boy Scouts is the world's largest boys' organization.
Since 1930, younger boys have had the opportunity to be Cub Scouts
in a year-round, home-centered program that strengthens the
family. Older boys participate in Boy Scout Troops or Explorer
Posts (see our brother <a href="t49home.htm">Troop 49</a> page).
The purpose of the Boy Scouts of America is to provide boys with
an effective program that builds moral strength and character,
develops fitness, and teaches the responsibilities of active citizenship.

<P>
In addition to our regular meetings, we intend to participate in several super high adventures each year.  All of our program and activities are being planned and carried out by the youth leaders in the post.  Adult Advisors, Committee Members and Consultants are available to assist the youth leaders at all times.
<P>
We will explore the interest's of our Post members in each of these six areas:

<P>
Our first adventure as a Post was the Capitol Area Council Explorer Super Activity at Lost Pines Scout Reservation on November 2, 1996 for rappeling and other fun events.

<P>
Our second adventure was the Longhorn District Camporee at Shaffer Bend Primitive Area on January 18 where we ran a first aid event.  We got to eat from the staff kitchen and meet some other local Explorers who were on staff, too.

<P>
We have just completed our first weekend campout event, held at Lost Pines Scout Reservation on February 1 and 2.  Ten of the fourteen current post members attended.  We passed by-laws, elected our new President, appointed a nominations committee for the other officer positions and discussed uniforms and possible events.  We had dutch oven cobbler, cookies, s'mores and lots of fun!

<P>
<IMG alt="*" src="./gifs/philmont.gif" align=bottom>
We will send a crew on a Backpacking Adventure at Philmont Scout Ranch and Explorer Base in New Mexico from June 29 through July 11, 1997.  In preparation, the Post and Crew will be camping out at Colorado Bend (February 14/16) and at Enchanted Rock (April 18/20).  A few slots are still available in the crew, so if you are interested in being part of one of <i>the</I> great adventures, call our Committee Chair, Jerry Withers, at 451.2979 or email him at

<H1> Mission Activities</H1>
<HR WIDTH=75%>
</CENTER>
<P>
From its beginning in this country, our national Presbyterian Church has been
involved in spreading the Good News of Jesus Christ throughout the world. Each
year a part of our church budget supports this outreach and there are
opportunities for people to go as Volunteers on Mission to many places near
and far.
<P>
For those who cannot make such a dedication of time and life, there are many
local areas where we can answer the same call to mission. We hope you might
find among those listed below an area or project which interests you. We invite
you to find out more about any of them by contacting the church office at the
number listed in the top page.
<H3>Manos De Cristo</H3>
<P>Beginning in 1987 at El Buen Pastor Presbyterian Church, Manos de Cristo was
begun as a social service ministry in East Austin. On-going work consists of a
dental clinic, after-school tutoring for children, a clothes closet which
distributes donated clothing, legal assistance, and help with English as a
second language. The clothes closet needs volunteers Tuesday through Friday,
9am to 5pm.
<P>Special projects include fund-raisers throughout the year such as
<I>Smilathon</I> for the dental clinic and the Christmas gift wrap at Sears
stores. Cinco de Mayo on May 5th is a Mexican dinner fundraiser for which
tickets are available. As each of these or other projects arise, volunteers are
needed.
<P>Wayne Dykes is our church's representative on the Manos Board.
<H3>Food for the Hungry</H3>
<P>The first Sunday of every month is our "First Food Sunday". We support Food
Bank Austin (where businesses and individuals donate food to a large warehouse
in southeast Austin and agencies that provide food can obtain it here), Faith
Food Pantries (housed in three local churches providing emergency groceries
through churches and agencies) and Caritas.
<P>Canned goods and non-perishables (beans, pastas, etc.) are brought to the
food chest in the narthex and then delivered to one of these agencies. Church
members go to the Capitol Area Food Bank to help sort and package the food. The
Food Bank can be contacted on 512 448 2111.
<H3>Hands on Housing</H3>
<P>In cooperation with Austin Metropolitan Ministries, teams from local
churches rehabilitate houses in East Austin. Workers scrape, paint and do
carpentry, roof and plumbing repairs. Other workers furnish snacks and help
with errands.
<P>A group from First Presbyterian is organized in April and all hands are
welcome.
<H3>CROP Walk</H3>
<P>Another April event, this Walk raises money for the hungry as walkers
solicit sponsors for donations. Twenty five percent of the money is used
locally and the rest world-wide. During March, a table is set up in the narthex
for sign-up.
<H3>Austin Metropolitan Ministries</H3>
<P>A citywide ecumenical agency, AMM helps churches and other agencies focus on
local needs and asists in helping to meet these needs. They sponsor a widely
attended Thanksgiving service each year in a different church and area of the
city at which Christians, Jews and Muslims join in dedication to serving the
God they all worship.
<P>AMM sponsors a number of mission opportunities including the Peace and
Justice Commission, the Youth Commission and the CROP Walk. Several members of
our church are active in the Gardner-Betts mentor program for first time
offenders.
<H3>AIDS Interfaith Ministry</H3>
<P>Teams from our church give friendship and support to AIDS clients who
request this service. Each member makes a contact on a designated day and
offers to visit, do errands, or help with transporation. This is a new ministry
that is evolving and growing.
<H3>Alternative Market</H3>
<P>An alternative way to give Christmas presents by making donations in the
name of a recipient, we have now had two Markets in November 1994 and 1995.
These raised more than $20,000 to aid programs in Austin, Texas and all over
the world with special emphasis on Presbyterian missions. The Market is a truly
educational event as booths representing the different projects have displays
and provide information sheets explaining the use of donations. Gift cards are
available with each donation.
<H3><A HREF="http://www.cwru.edu/CWRU/Org/habhum/home.html">Habitat for
Humanity</A></H3>
<P>The Austin branch of this national agency plans to have members of local
Presbyterian churches build a "Presbyterian house" funded by and with some
labor done by members of the congregations in Austin.
<P>Other denominations will build additional houses. The goal is to build a
1000 sq.ft. home with 400 hours of labor donated by the family that will live
there. Help is needed for fundraising, food coordination and volunteer
coordination. Work is done on Saturdays and Wednesday and Friday afternoons.
<H3>East Austin Sister Church</H3>
<P>This ministry is still in its early stages after a joint service between FPC
and Freedom Home Baptist Church commemorating and celebrating the life of Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. The vision is that our two churches will visit each
other, form friendships and exchange worship services and choirs. Start-up
money has come from the church's contribution to the annual church-wide
Peacemaking Offering eaach fall. One-fourth of the offering remains with each
local church for their use.

<H3>Evelyn Wright Presbyterian Women (EWPW)</H3>
<H4>Once upon a time....</H4>
<P>Some women recognized a need. Though they literally had to "plow the fields
and scatter the good grain all around", they gathered together to study
missions, sew, pray, minister to each other, and raise money to provide some
necessities (pulpit and communion table, etc.) for First Presbyterian Church of
Austin, Texas.
<P>That was in 1851.
<P>As the mission of the church changed and grew with every new age, so the
original sewing circle changed and grew into what is now <I>Evelyn Wright
Presbyterian Women</I>. Since 1907 there has been a women's group named for
Evelyn Wright, wife of a beloved, long-ago pastor.
<H4>In this time...</H4>
<P>Evelyn Wright Presbyterian Women gather together
<UL>
<LI>to learn about issues of today's world and what we as Christians can do
about them;
<LI>for Bible and Mission Study;
<LI>to meet local community needs;
<LI>for fellowship
<LI>and for service to this church.
</UL>
<P>Although we are proud of our heritage and traditions, we continue to change
and grow, to keep as current as the lead story of the newspaper.
<H3>Grape Gathering</H3>
<P>This adjunct to EWPW is a women's study and luncheon group which meets from
12:00 to 1:00 in the parlor on the second and fourth Monday of each month.
Contact Carol Burgeson for further information.
<H3>Mothers on Mondays</H3>
<P>Mothers on Mondays, or MOMs, meet, as the name suggests, on Monday mornings
from 9:30am until 11am in the parlor. Contact Jane Bassett for further
information.

<H2>First Presbyterian Church of Austin, Texas</H2>
</CENTER>
<IMG SRC="churchsk.jpg" ALT="Sanctuary Sketch" ALIGN="left">
The congregation traces its history to the early years of Austin and the
missionary activities of the Rev. Daniel Baker. After a visit to Austin in
1848, Daniel Baker recommended the organization of a Presbyterian congregation
in the city. His son, William H. Baker, newly ordained to the Presbyterian
ministry, arrived here in May 1850 and organized the First Presbyterian
Church. Among the charter members was master builder Abner Cook who later
built the Texas Governor's Mansion.
<P>The first sanctuary, built in downtown Austin on land donated by Cook, was
completed in 1851. It was replaced by a stone structure in 1890. The
congregation continued to worship at the downtown site until 1960 when they
relocated to Jackson Street in north central Austin.
<P>The church moved to new facilities at the current site on Mesa Drive in
1978. Historic stained glass windows and the original cornerstone from the
1890 stone sanctuary were incorporated into the design of the new building.
<P>The First Presbyterian Church of Austin continues to serve its members and
the community with a variety of worship, educational and outreach programs.

<h1 align=center>The History of the Organ</h1>
<p align=center><em>Compiled by Scott McNulty, SP, CAGO</em> </p>

<p align=center><img src="organske.gif" alt="Organ Sketch" align=middle width=151 height=346> </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Music has been an important part of First Presbyterian Church from the 
very beginning. Founded in 1850 in the first state capitol log cabin, some 
historians date the church back earlier to 1839 when the Indians often ran 
worshippers from services. Possibly made in Concord, Massachusetts, 
the original instrument at First Church was a harmonium that lasted until 
about 1857. A five octave melodia was then purchased for $300 from 
George A. Prince of Buffalo, New York. One picture of the church in 
1897 shows an organ with several ranks of pipes, both wood and metal, 
in the chancel area of the church which could be the melodia organ. </p>
<p>Under the leadership of long-time pastor, the Reverend E. B. Wright, the 
1890 church building was built debt free. When the opportunity came 
later to add a fine pipe organ, the church was able to do so without 
adding to any existing mortgage debts. In October of 1899, the purchase 
of a pipe organ was approved by the Session at a cost of $2500. As part 
of the agreement, the old melodia was sold for $300 to the organ builder, 
the M&ouml;ller Organ Company of Hagerstown, Maryland. </p>
<p>Mathias Peter M&ouml;ller was born in Denmark in 1854 and began working 
as an apprentice with a carriage maker before coming to the United 
States at age seventeen. Later known for building luxury cars and 
taxicabs, M&ouml;ller put his mechanical skills to good use in the organ 
industry. A series of moves in Pennsylvania and a disastrous fire at the 
Hagerstown location in 1895 allowed the company to rebuild and expand 
from a production of 20 organs a year to over 250 organs a year by 
1921. After building almost twelve thousand pipe organs during a career 
spanning over a hundred years, the M&ouml;ller company went bankrupt in the 
early 1990's. </p>
<p>Built for the church's 50th anniversary, Opus 263 was installed sometime 
early in 1900. The first of two inaugural concerts on the instrument was 
Friday, March 16th, 1900 by the famed organist Clarence Eddy. Eddy 
was born in Greenfield, Massachusetts on June 23, 1851 and later 
performed at the Vienna Exhibition in 1873, the Centennial Exposition in 
Philadelphia in 1876, the Paris Exhibition in 1881 and the World's Fair in 
Chicago in 1893. Known especially for his wide repertoire, Eddy 
presented 100 weekly concerts without ever repeating any selection. 
Soon after his concert at First Church, he began a series of recitals 
around the country. </p>
<p>Eddy's First Church concert included such music as &quot;Morceau de 
Concert&quot; opus 24 (<i>Prelude, Theme, Variations and Finale</i>) by 
Alexander Guilmant, &quot;O Divine Redeemer&quot; by Charles Gounod, &quot;Pilgrims 
Chorus&quot; from <i>Tannhaeusser</i> by Richard Wagner, &quot;The Holy Night&quot; by 
contemporary organist Dudley Buck and &quot;Fugue in D minor&quot; by J.S. 
Bach. Eddy and Buck were some of the leaders in the U.S. to bring the 
music of Bach to the listening audience and regularly included Bach's 
music along with the typical opera transcriptions of the day. An original 
copy of the recital program survives in the church archives. </p>
<p>A total of $69.52 was raised from the Eddy recital and added to the 
organ fund, along with other donations and concert offerings. Among the 
donors of the day were the Brackenridges, L. T. Scarborough, Laura 
Driskoll and concerts by the Blind Pupils and resident organist David 
Grove. The First Church Ladies Aid Society gave the largest donation, a 
$1015 gift, which was quite a sum in 1900 ! In worship, the organ was 
dedicated on Sunday, March 18, 1900 with a music sermon by paster 
Rev. Wright and later published by the Organ Fund Committee at the 
requrest of the choir. Though a few pages are missing from a later copy 
of the original, the fifteen pages of the sermon that survived probably 
show how long and detailed the weekly sermons of this popular preacher 
were. </p>
<p>The organ remained mostly untouched for the next fifty plus years. Some 
changes may have been included in 1929 while Dr. Dan Grieder was 
pastor, though no details remain. Undoubtedly the organ blowers were 
electrified at some point, but the original pump bellows were in existance 
until the 1957 rebuilding. Renovations to the sanctuary were included in 
the 1929 project, with special attention to improving the acoustics as well 
as a new heating system. One picture taken about 1914 shows the old 
stove pipe that was used to heat the big church during the cold winter 
months. The organist's salary at that time was $25 a month. </p>
<p>Rebuilt again in 1956-7 by Otto Hofmann of Austin, Texas, at a cost of 
$9600, a new pedal chest was added ot the organ, along with 
electro-pneumatic stop action, &quot;tripper&quot; type of combination action, and 
an American Guild of Organists standard pedal board (<i>replacing a flat, 
30 note board</i>). Hoffman added several mixtures (<i>including an eight 
rank Mixture on the Swell</i>) and pedal stops while keeping the original 
tracker playing action which had been stiff and heavy to play. In an article 
dated May 29, 1960, the Austin American-Statesman said the following: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We might add, that this particular organ's antiquity was 
brought to the fore recently, when in its renovation, many 
old newspapers that had been used as glue-battens in the 
original installation were withdrawn from its innards. 
Those old news sheets headlined the Boer War and 
carried advertisements about the sale of 'high class' 
women's shoes, 75 cents per pair, and 'choice' 
beefsteak, 15 cents per pound !&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hofmann has since noted that another newspaper found in the organ 
proclaimed &quot;Dewey Takes Manilla.&quot; The first American organ builder to 
be a part of the American Classic Organ renewal movement, Hofmann 
was influential in bringing affordable tracker and electro-pneumatic pipe 
organs to the smaller churches in Texas and the Southwest. His trips to 
Europe and encounters with pipe organ builders in other countries, led 
him to experiment with organs on low wind pressure and limiting the 
number of lower sounds while increasing the number of higher pitches 
and timbres, an &quot;inverted pyramid&quot;. </p>
<p>The musicians of the church must have been heartbroken when they 
learned the church would be moving to the Jackson Avenue location only 
a few years after the last organ rebuilding project. Dr. John Bee, a 
University of Texas organ teacher and Organist/Choirmaster at St. 
David's Episcopal Church, Austin, presented a recital on the Presbyterian 
organ on May 29, 1960 for the 110th Anniversary of First Church. 
Performing an all-Bach program, the concert featured &quot;Prelude and 
Fugue in B minor&quot;, three chorale tunes, &quot;Sonata No. 1 in E Flat&quot; and 
&quot;Toccata in F Major&quot; among others. This was probably the last concert 
on the organ before it was dismantled by Otto Hofmann and put into 
storage. For the next eighteen years, the organ sat in the PeeWee 
Warehouse on East First Street at a rate of $15 a month. Robbers broke 
into the warehouse at one point, but fortunately ignored the many pipes 
stacked in a confusing array. During this time, a Baldwin electronic organ 
was used at the Jackson Avenue site. </p>
<p>When the congregation decided to move to the Mesa Drive location, 
attention was again focused on the former organ and the many beautiful 
stained glass windows from the 1890 sanctuary. Rebuilt in 1979 by 
Rubin Frels of Victoria, Texas, the organ was given its present home on 
the east wall. Frels designed the beautiful layout, and built the wood pipes 
for the facade in his own shop. This time the organ included new Principal 
(<i>Prestant</i>) on the Great division, the addition of a Celeste and the 
subtraction of a Mixture on the Swell. Frels also added the Cromhorne 
and Cymbal on the Great. Though the 16' Pedal Prestant is an extension 
of the Great stop of the same name, the 16' Faggot is full length. The total 
cost to rebuild was budgeted at $11,000. </p>
<p>The dedication recital was on November 12, 1978 at 3:00pm by Dr. 
James H. Cook, a former organist. Music included &quot;Fugue in E Flat 
Major&quot; by J.S. Bach, &quot;Voluntary in G&quot; by Henry Heron, &quot;A Mighty 
Fortress Is Our God&quot; by J.G. Walthers, &quot;O Sacred Head&quot; by Johannes 
Brahms, &quot;La Nativit&eacute;&quot; by Jean Langlais and &quot;Finale&quot; from <i>Symphony No. 
2</i> by Louis Vierne. </p>
<p>Later minor renovations over the next few years by Broocke Eubank 
included the addition of a Pedal 16' Gedeckt, a Great 8' Trompette 
(<i>which used to be a horizontal Trumpet and is now located in the 
Swell</i>), a Swell 8' Krumhorn to replace the Swell Schalmei, a reworking 
of the shutters to open to 90 degrees, and the removal of the Schlamei 
for later use by the church. Other work hoped for included replacing the 
Prestant with a new 8' Spitz, changing out the 4' Octave in the Great, and 
replacing the 2' Nacht with a rebuilt Schalmei. On June 29, 1983 Mr. 
Eubank proposed reracking the Swell 8' Principal at 4' pitch because of 
its various origins, poor sounds and too many 8' stops on Swell. This was 
carried out to good success. Eventually the Trumpet was put in the Swell 
box, and the Krumhorn brought to the Great manual. </p>
<p>Today, about ten ranks of pipes are original to the first 1900 organ. As 
the church turns towards its 150th anniversary in the year 2000, more 
work will be needed to repair broken or worn parts. Some of the pipes 
should be replaced while a few others need to be revoiced to produce a 
clearer and quicker speech. It would also be exciting to add several 
ranks of pipes or to add another manual and division to give organists a 
wider range of sounds. As the music program grows with the 
congregation, it is hoped that this interest will be available to maintain and 
increase the versatility of this historic instrument. Through lectures, 
workshops, recitals, private lessons and music academies, the music staff 
is dedicated to promoting this special pipe organ to the Austin 
community. </p>
<p>But the primary commitment of First Presbyterian Church is to maintain 
the highest quality instrument possible in its worship of God Almighty. For 
that we can be very grateful that many others have led the way. Worship 
is not directed at some machine that speaks sonorous tones or faint 
whispers. We worship a living God that we hope is pleased with our 
humble efforts to sing psalms and spiritual songs. </p>
<p>The stained glass window above the organ pipes shows an urn with fire 
rising out of it. Whether this represents the Holy Spirit or simply was a 
great place to put the large half-circle window, it seems right and proper 
that the blaze should crown the heart of this majestic organ. May Opus 
263 lead all people to a greater understanding of God, and closer to the 
Divine Mystery. </p>
<p>Special thanks go to Otto Hofmann, Broocke Eubank, Rubin Frels, Alan 
Laufman of the Organ Clearing House, and the many church members, 
staff and friends who helped with the details. Published pamphlets, church 
bulletins, newsletters, photographs as well as Session minutes from as far 
back as 1897 helped with the research of this project. </p>

<H2>Sunday Mornings at the First UU Church of Austin</H2>

<H3>Worship Services</H3>
<P>
Two services are held every Sunday in our beautiful, modern sancutary,
at 9:30 and 11:15 a.m. Services last one hour and include singing,
readings from secular or sacred sources, a period of silent meditation,
choral or instrumental music, a prayer, and a sermon on a religious,
ethical, historical, or life issues theme. Following each service is
a social time to which all guests and visitors are cordially invited.
<P>
Children are always welcome at our services. We normally have a short story
or homily specifically for them, after which the children are excused to
go to their religious education classes. (Children are also welcome to
remain with their family for the whole service!) Infant and toddler care
is provided during the service and at all church events by paid, trained staff. 
<P>
Our facility is mostly handicapped-accessible.

<H3>Public Affairs Forum</H3>
<P>
The church hosts public speakers and presentations on a wide range
of current affairs, at 11:15 a.m., in Howson Hall. Call the church
office during business hours to learn what the next topic will be.

<H3>Religious Education</H3>
<P>
Age-appropriate religious education classes are offered every Sunday,
for children, youth, and adults. The children and youth classes are
start after the "Story for All Ages," which is about 15 minutes after
the start of worship services, and run for one hour. The adult classes
begin at 9:30 a.m.

<H2>Profile of the First UU Church of Austin</H2>

<P>
First Unitarian Universalist Church of Austin is a congregation
of about 350 voting members dedicated to lifelong spiritual
growth and learning through our religious community. Approximately
300 people attend Sunday services and about 100 children and adults
attend church school each Sunday.
<P>
During our search for a minister in 1994, we conducted
a survey of the congregation, which provides some valuable
insights into who we are. The following paragraphs summarize
some of the results of that survey.
<P>
We have an active congregation that feels well-informed about
the governance and activities of the church. Responses indicated
that most people are extremely positive about the morale of the
church and the church's future. While responses were mixed, most
people seem to feel that the church is about the right size. We
feel that we are part of a loving community, are proud of our
church, and are optimistic about its future.
<P>
Fellowship, children's religious education, public worship and
promoting spiritual growth were identified as the most important
functions of the church. Respondents counted all listed activities
as important, with very few people counting any activity as &quot;not
important.&quot; In the future, we would like to focus more on
Unitarian Universalism past and present, family and intergenerational
participation, and social problems of the community.
<P>
We are extremely diverse in our religious beliefs; many respondents
agreed with several of the different theological beliefs identified
in the survey. Naturalistic theism and ethical religion received
the strongest positive responses with mysticism and agnosticism
close behind.

</H1>
<H2>Steam railroading in Central Texas </H2>
After 40 years, steam railroading has returned to Central Texas with the
advent of regular steam excursion service into the scenic Hill Country northwest
of Austin. <B>The Austin Steam Train Association</B> has brought together
a historic locomotive and train-set with a historic piece of railroad to
give visitors and Central Texans an unforgettable experience of American
railroading's glorious past. ASTA--a community-based, non-profit association--has
restored both a vintage Southern Pacific steam locomotive plus a train of
period passenger cars and, operating as the Austin & Central Railroad, placed
them in regular weekend service over a scenic 33-mile route from Cedar Park
to Burnet.<BR>
<BR>
The train is powered by Southern Pacific Engine No. <A HREF="786.htm">786</A>,
a &quot;Mikado&quot;-type steam locomotive built by the American Locomotive
Co. in 1916. She operated over the<A HREF="texasrr.htm"> SP's Texas and
Louisiana</A> lines in freight and passenger service until her retirement
in 1956 . The 786 was placed on display in a downtown Austin park, where
she sat for 34 years as a handsome but forlorn relic of the steam era. 
<H2>A locomotive, 163 miles of track, a natural combination.</H2>
In 1986, the City of Austin acquired 163 miles of railroad line being abandoned
by the Southern Pacific, and the seed of the steam-train project was planted.
The Austin Steam Train Association was chartered in 1989 to bring together
the city's locomotive and the city's tracks in a living recreation of railroad
history.<BR>
<BR>
The City Council leased the 786 to the new non-profit group, and the engine
was carefully removed from the park and pulled to a shop facility lent to
ASTA by the Westinghouse Motor Co. at its Round Rock plant. In the summer
of 1990, the enormous task of bringing the 143-ton locomotive back to life
began, under the direction of <B>Diversified Rail Services Inc.</B>, a professional
locomotive-restoration firm. DRS crews and ASTA volunteers completely dismantled
the engine and rebuilt her from the rails up, repairing, rebuilding or replacing
all of the 786's thousands of components.<BR>
<BR>
In less than two years' time--a record for large for large locomotive restorations
in the U.S.-- the 786 stood alive, steaming and ready for service, making
her debut to the public in ceremonies in downtown Austin in December, 1991.<BR>
<BR>
ASTA has trackage rights over the 33-mile Cedar Park-Burnet route under
an agreement with the city and Capital Metro, which manages the line. The
track, also used for weekday freight service, has been recently upgraded
to insure comfortable and save passenger operations. 
<H2>It really helps when you have some place to go.</H2>
At Burnet, local residents under the leadership of <B>Frank Fickett</B>
have provided a depot, yard trackage and other facilities for the train's
northern terminus. Operation at Cedar Park is conducted from A&amp;TC's
16 acre home yard, with ticketing and boarding facilities at Capital Metro's
adjacent park-and-ride terminal. In between, the line traverses an area
of remarkable scenic beauty left surprisingly untouched considering its
proximity to a major urban area. From Cedar Park, the track runs up the
cedar and oak wooded valley of the South San Gabriel River, crossing that
stream on a spectacular trestle, and climbs 500 feet to the top of the valley
before dropping down a steep grade into the hill-nestled town of Burnet.
<H2>The people who do all this.</H2>
The Austin Steam Train Association is governed by a 30-member <A HREF="astabod.htm">Board
Of Directors</A> and has been supported by memberships, contributions, grants
and the guarantees of its directors. <B>Ben Sargent</B> is the chairman
of the board and <B>Steve Matthews</B> is president.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Robert Crossman</B> is General Superintendent of Operations, in charge
of all railroad activities. <B>Jim Koonce</B> is Business Manager of ASTA.
<B>Arden Brands</B> is our executive director and oversees the association's
Austin office at 116 E. 6th Street, home base for the association's administrative
operations. ASTA's office telephone number is (512) 477-6377; the reservation
number is (512) 477-8468 and, the fax number 477-8633.<BR>
<BR>
The operation of the Hill Country Flyer is done completely by volunteers.
All of the enginemen, trainmen, car attendants and concession persons are
volunteers each fully trained and qualified for his or her job. All engineers,
firemen, conductors, brakemen and track patrol operators have passed the
A&TC rules examination as well as a railroad physical and are subject to
all other FRA rules.<BR>
<BR>
Future plans for expansion of the A&amp;TC, besides completion of the terminal
at Cedar Park, include extension of service into downtown Austin and acquisition
of other cars and locomotives.<BR>
<BR>
ASTA owes the success of Central Texas' steam train to the tireless efforts
of hundreds of corporations, organizations, volunteers, members and contributors
throughout Austin and Texas. Thanks to them, Central Texas can take pride
in its steam train as a priceless piece of historical preservation, a vigorous
stimulus to the area's economy, a hands-on educational experience, an unparalleled
opportunity for family-oriented fun and a legacy to our children of American
railroading's brawny youth.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Every locomotive needs a train.</CENTER>
</H1>
<H2>A little bit here, a little bit there...</H2>
The passenger cars that make up the Hill Country Flyer are a very eclectic
mix. They reflect passenger railroading of various types, from different
eras and from widely separated parts of the country. Our first acquisition
after the 786 itself was a set of seven PRR P70FBR commuter coaches. Of
the seven, one had already been transformed into a concession car, and one
was so badly damaged that it has not yet seen any service. <BR>
<BR>
After the coaches, three sleeper lounge cars came available for lease. Each
one has four or five bedrooms and a large lounge or diner area. The <B>Eagle
Cliff</B> is an ex MoPac car and ran through Austin often on the MoPac Texas
Eagle. The <B>Red Rock</B> (probably not the original name) is a Santa Fe
car that originally had a barber shop in one compartment. The farthest from
home is the Nickel Plate <B>City of Chicago</B>, which is probably the only
Nickel Plate passenger car still in regularly scheduled service. 
<H2>Every train needs a caboose?</H2>
In addition, we have the use of a Santa Fe caboose. On a passenger train,
this may seem strange to some , but it is available for private parties.
If the caboose is not occupied, we sell raffle tickets on the return trip
for a short caboose ride from Liberty Hill back into Cedar Park.<BR>

</H1>
<H2>Our Schedule</H2>
The Hill Country Flyer operates every Saturday and Sunday starting in March
and continuing through December. March through Thanksgiving, the train leaves
at 10:00 am from Cedar Park, TX. The two hour trip to Burnet, TX is followed
by a three hour layover in Burnet. This allows time for lunch, a little
antique shopping and the show put on by the Burnet Gunfighters Assn. At
3:00 PM the train backs out of town, using a wye to turn the train for the
return trip to Cedar Park and arrives there about 5:30 PM.<BR>
<BR>
We also run an occasional Twilight Flyer. On certain Saturdays, this train
departs from Cedar Park at 7:00 PM and returns at 9:00. <BR>
<BR>
After Thanksgiving, the departure from Cedar Park is at 2:30 PM. This places
you in Burnet in time for dinner followed by a stroll around the square
to view the thousands of Christmas lights. A 7:00 PM departure returns you
to Cedar Park about 9:30 PM. 
<H2>Making Reservations</H2>
Reservations on the Hill Country Flyer can be made by calling (512) 477-8468<BR>

<H1><CENTER>RAILROADING IN AUSTIN</CENTER>
</H1>
<H2>The tracks...</H2>
The tracks over which the 786 and her excursion trains run are part of former
Southern Pacific branch line now owned by the Capital Metro. Bought by the
city of Austin when the SP abandoned it in 1985, it was sold to Capital
Metro in late 1995. The 163-mile line is in daily use by the Longhorn Railway
for diesel-powered freight service. 
<H2>A railroad with a history.</H2>
The branch is rich in both scenery and history, running through the rolling
Blackland Prairie from Giddings through Elgin and Manor to Austin, then
westward into the spectacular Hill Country through Burnet to Llano and Marble
Falls.<BR>
<BR>
The line west of Austin, where steam-powered excursion service is now running,
was chartered as the original Austin & Northwestern in 1881 with grand dreams
of connecting the Capitol City with the Texas & Pacific's transcontinental
line at Abilene. At the time, narrow-gauge railroads, with 3 feet between
their rails instead of the standard-gauge 4 feet 8 l/2 inches, were in their
heyday across the nation because of their efficiencies of construction and
operation. The A&amp;NW's organizers saw narrow gauge as the most cost-effective
means of building through the rugged Hill Country, and it was with narrow-gauge
tracks that the line reached Burnet in 1882. 
<H2>A Capitol idea.</H2>
Three years later, the little road enjoyed a rendezvous with history when
the owners of Granite Mountain near Marble Falls agreed to donate the necessary
stone to build Texas' magnificent pink-granite Capitol. The A&NW extended
its line to Marble Falls in 1888 and began hauling the material to Austin
to complete the new state house. All the famed pink granite for the construction
of Texas' magnificent Capitol was carried to Austin over the A&amp;NW's
rails. 
<H2>Two become one.</H2>
In 1890, beset since its inception with chronic financial ills, the A&NW passed
into the hands of a new owner, who converted the road to standard gauge
and extended a branch from Fairland, north of Marble Falls, to Llano in
1892. Nine years later, the original A&NW ceased to exist, becoming part
of the Houston & Texas Central Railroad.<BR>
<BR>
The H&amp;TC, with a rich history of its own, was the builder of the Giddings-to-Austin
segment of the city-owned line, and was the first railroad built into Austin,
arriving at the end of 1871. The H&TC was Texas' first major railroad project
and had started from its namesake city in 1856, reaching Millican, 80 miles
north, before the Civil War stopped work. When the hostilities ended, the
H&TC resumed construction with a will, reaching Bryan in 1867, Dallas in
1872 and the Red River at Denison a year later. 
<H2>Railroading begins for Austin.</H2>
Meanwhile, the H&TC in 1869 had bought the 22-mile Washington County Railroad,
which connected Brenham with the H&TC at Hempstead, and began pushing it
westward toward Austin. The new branch had reached Hills, west of Giddings,
by the end of 1870 and arrived in the Capital City on Christmas Day, 1871.
Gov. A. J. Hamilton and a crowd of more than half of Austin's 5,000 citizens
gathered at the new depot to greet the first train, but the engine faltered
some distance from the city and the throng dwindled in a drizzling rain.
As night began to fall, however, a whistle call signaled the approach of
the revived locomotive, and a belated celebration began which lasted for
weeks.<BR>
<BR>
The H&TC built yards, a roundhouse and a handsome Congress Avenue depot
in Austin, and in 1901 acquired the A&amp;NW, extending the line from Burnet
to Lampasas . (This extension was abandoned in 1951. ) About the same time,
the H&TC was coming under the control of Southern Pacific interests, and
although it was not officially absorbed into the SP subsidiary Texas & New
Orleans until 1934, the whole branch was operated as a part of the SP system
from the early years of the century until abandonment.<BR>
<BR>
The H&TC began offering Texas' first Pullman service on its Houston-Austin
run in mid-1872, and for many years the line to the east was the main route
for passengers between the two cities, with two trains daily in each direction.
The line west, although primarily occupied with the products of the Hill
Country quarries, had modest provision for passengers as well, with a daily
local which operated until 1936.<BR>
<BR>
With the abandonment of the line by the SP and its purchase by the city
in 1985--primarily to preserve it as a potential mass-transit corridor--the
branch's history began to return, first in the resurrection of the Austin
& Northwestern's corporate name by the shortline operator RailTex, Inc.,
and then with the return of passenger trains and Southern Pacific steam
under the auspices of the Austin Steam Train Association. 
<H2>A&NW + H&TC = A&amp;TC</H2>
ASTA's operating name - Austin & Texas Central - combines the names of the
line's two original owners - the Austin & Northwestern and the Houston & Texas
Central - as a salute to the rich and colorful history of its home rails.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>RAILROADING IN TEXAS</CENTER>
</H1>
<H2>Texas railroading before the Civil War</H2>
The construction of railroads proved essential to the settlement of Texas,
with its endless far-flung distances. Nineteenth-century Texans, as early
as the days of the Republic, understood that only the steam locomotive could
securely conquer the vast spaces around them, but with the state's small
and thinly spread population, the beginning of railroad development were
slow.<BR>
<BR>
The first line to be built in Texas was the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos & Colorado,
which began operating over 20 miles of track from Harrisburg--near Houston--to
Stafford's Point in 1853. Before the Civil War brought a halt to railroad
construction, only a few other roads were built, totaling less than 500
miles. Most of these brought local traffic to Houston and Galveston. 
<H2>Texas railroading recovers from the &quot;unpleasantness&quot;</H2>
As the state began to emerge from the economic devastation of the war, the
first major railroad project in Texas--the Houston & Texas Central--began
to build northward from its namesake city. The H&TC reached Bryan in 1867,
branched into <A HREF="austinrr.htm">Austin in 1871</A>, arrived in Dallas
a year later and by 1872 reached from the Gulf to the Red River.<BR>
<BR>
By then, a full-scale railway boom was under way across the state. The International
Railroad--forerunner of the International & Great Northern--was tracing
a bold diagonal from Texas' northeast corner through Palestine, Austin and
San Antonio toward the Rio Grande. The Missouri-Kansas-Texas, building in
from the north, reached Dallas and struck southward for San Antonio and
Houston. Galveston interests, frustrated that Houston had become Texas'
railroad center, began pushing the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe inland toward
Temple and Fort Worth. The Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio completed
a link between the Alamo City and the Gulf Coast. 
<H2>The 1880's: A period of great expansion</H2>
As these and other railroads began to fan out through postwar Texas, total
mileage increased six-fold, from 500 miles in 1870 to 3,000 in 1880. But
still to come was the state's greatest era of railroad expansion, the 1880's.<BR>
<BR>
Primary in this expansion were the monumental extensions of the GH&SA (now
the Southern Pacific) westward from San Antonio and of the Texas & Pacific
southwestward from Fort Worth, both toward the far-away terminus of El Paso.
Completion of these lines placed Texas astride the nation's second and southernmost
transcontinental route. At the same time, the Fort Worth & Denver City was
building across the Panhandle toward Colorado, and the GC&SF and MKT were
completing their widespread systems. Total mileage tripled again, reaching
nearly 9,000 miles by 1890, and in a single year--1881--track gangs laid
down more than 1,500 miles of railroad in Texas.<BR>
<BR>
By the last decade of the century, the railroads spanning Texas had become
haughty economic giants, with most of the trackage under the control of
a few large systems. At one point, railroad baron Jay Gould alone controlled
one-third of all the mileage in Texas . Under these conditions, monopoly
and corruption flourished, and high rates, price discrimination, traffic
pools and bribery were counted among the railroads' abuses. Public outcry,
culminating in the election of Gov. Jim Hogg and the establishment of the
Texas Railroad Commission in 1891, produced the nation's first effective
state regulation of large corporations. 
<H2>A peak is reached</H2>
As the state moved into the 20th Century, track construction continued to
connect new areas into the rail network, particularly in the booming new
oil fields. Total miles peaked at the height of the Great Depression, in
1932, at just over 17,000 miles of line. The hard times turned expansion
into contraction, as marginal branches began to wither from the system,
and despite the vigorous shot of economic vitality produced by World War
II, the Texas railroads were in a trend of route consolidation which continues
today. (There are now about 12,000 miles of railroad in Texas.)<BR>
<BR>
Like their counterparts across the nation, Texas railroads struggled through
tumultuous readjustments in the postwar era. Steam gave way to diesel-electric
power, and the passenger train--which in Texas had included such proud and
romantic names as the Bluebonnet, the Sunset Limited, the Texas Special
and the Texas Zephyr--dwindled to a sad ghost of its former glory. 
<H2>Rock bottom, then a turnaround</H2>
The lines hit bottom in the 1970s, but--with a redefinition of their mission
as efficient, high-speed freight haulers--began climbing back to a sound
and promising economic future as the 1990s began. Further consolidation
brought much of Texas' trackage into some of the nation's railway megasystems--the
Santa Fe, the SP, the Union Pacific and the Burlington Northern--but produced
at the same time a spin-off of some routes into smaller, more efficient
short lines and regional railroads. And the passenger train, now prospering
under the management of Amtrak, has returned to Texas as well.<BR>
<BR>
After a history every bit as rough-and-tumble and the histories of its storied
cattle and petroleum industries, Texas' railroad industry shows every prospect
of continuing to serve the state's life and growth into the new century.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Anatomy of a steam locomotive inspection</CENTER>
</H1>
<!-- Converted with HTML Markup 2.0 by Scott J. Kleper --><BR>
Every other year the 786 must go into the shop for a detailed locomotive
inspection. The U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Railroad Administration
(FRA) mandates this practice and patterns it after the old Interstate Commerce
Commission rules put in place when steam locomotives were the rule rather
than the exception. <BR>
<BR>
The FRA divides inspection and repair of a locomotive into three basic areas:
required (the &quot;have to's&quot;), recommended (it's a good idea) and
optional (if you have time). They designed these different levels of inspection
and repair to accomplish different goals. The Austin & Texas Central does
all of the required inspection and parts of the other two. What follows
is a brief description of some of the tasks involved in each level of inspection.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>The &quot;have to's&quot;</B><BR>
The main thrust of the required inspection is to determine whether the locomotive
is safe to operate. The FRA isn't concerned with efficiency or reliability
of the equipment, only whether or not it meets the requirements of safety
both for workers and the general public. <BR>
Every steam locomotive under the jurisdiction of the FRA must undergo a
biannual inspection. This inspection requires that mechanics test all flexible
stay bolts to be certain that none are broken. To reach these stay bolts
they must remove the piping and jacketing around the outside of the firebox
and, in some places, remove appliances and sections of running board. Only
then can they remove the stay bolt caps.<BR>
<BR>
After the mechanics test the stay bolts and replace any failures, they reinstall
the caps and make a hydrostatic test of the boiler. They must seal any caps
they find leaking and run the test again. After mechanics seal all the caps,
they reapply the insulation jacketing, piping, running boards and appliances.
<BR>
<BR>
During the hydrostatic test, run at 1.25 times the rated working pressure
of the boiler (or 250 lbs. for the SP 786), mechanics inspect the entire
boiler for leaks or other signs of trouble. If they find any, they then
correct and test those problems. They also test the air compressor or pump
to determine whether it will produce the required amount of air for the
brake system (If the air pump sometimes is hard to start in the morning
but performs well after this and passes the test, then the FRA allows it
to continue in service). <BR>
<BR>
<B>There is an extensive list of other FRA required inspection &quot;musts&quot;:</B>
<UL>
<LI>Air tanks hammered (actually beat all over with a hammer to loosen internal
rust or debris that may hide a leak or thin spot) and hydrostatically tested,
unless they are enameled, in which case the tanks are not hammered since
this would remove the coating from the inside (if enameled reservoirs have
been hammered they must be hammered from that point onward since the hammering
will break the enamel coating and allow corrosion to take place. The air
tanks on the 786 are not enameled.) 
<LI>Drawbar(s) nondestructively tested (NDTed) along with the pins that
secure them to the engine and tender to ensure that there are no cracks
that could lead to a failure. 
<LI>Gages tested and calibrated. 
<LI>Boiler washed, entered and inspected on the inside, paying particular
attention to knuckles in flue sheets and stays and braces. 
<LI>Smoke box cleaned out. 
<LI>Water glasses, column and gauge cocks removed, cleaned and inspected
so that they will provide an accurate measurement of the water level. 
<LI>Appliances functioning correctly and without defects (be in a safe and
suitable condition for service). 
<LI>Safety valves on the boiler tested and set one at a time. 
<LI>A new set of brake valves applied to the locomotive. 
<LI>A general mechanical inspection and running gear in a condition suitable
for service. There are limits specified for lateral motion of axles and
other bearings, clearance in the crosshead assembly and other moving party.
<LI>Spring rigging set up correctly because out-of-adjustment springs or
rigging could contribute to a derailment. 
</UL>
<BR>
<B>It's a good idea</B><BR>
The FRA designed the recommended inspection to increase the efficiency of
the locomotive in terms of downtime, on-the-line failures and cost of operations.
It consists of all of the required inspection detailed above along with
a number of other items.<BR>
At this level the inspector is looking for anything odd that might indicate
trouble in the locomotive. He may remove selected bearings and examine them
to get a general idea of bearing condition beyond the lateral clearance
measurements required by the FRA. Mechanics will jack up the tender to lubricate
the tender trucks and center bolster as well as inspect their condition.
<BR>
They'll also inspect other small items and do some preventative repair work.
That might include replacing the top head on an air pump that is known to
have a sticky reversing valve or replacing all of the grease cakes in the
driving box cellars. Mechanics aim all of these items at heading off nagging
little problems before they become big problems and lead to a failure of
some component.<BR>
<BR>
<B>If you have time</B><BR>
The optional inspection includes all of the first two inspections but carries
them one step further. Instead of just finding out if something is safe
or just performing some form of preventative maintenance, mechanics look
for things that are not yet noticeable but eventually may lead to problems.
<BR>
They would remove the rods, valves and pistons to check their wearing surfaces
and those with which they mate to determine their condition and remaining
life in service. They replace any parts that may not last until the next
scheduled shopping, and completely open up, examine and rebuild the air
pump. <BR>
The optional inspection includes any steps that can be taken to prevent
on-the-road failures. This provides the best reliability rate for the equipment,
but it may also lead to numerous changes in design and the look of the equipment.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>A HISTORY OF ALCO-BROOKS</CENTER>
</H1>
<!-- Converted with HTML Markup 2.0 by Scott J. Kleper --><BR>
<BR>
The Erie Barge Canal was completed in 1825. It allowed passengers and freight
to move from the New York City area, up the Hudson River to Albany and Troy,
NY, then westward on the canal to Buffalo at the eastern end of Lake Erie.
This waterway provided a reliable but very slow route (1 1/2 mph average
speed) for manufactured goods to flow into the developing markets of the
Midwest, and raw materials to pour into the industrial centers in the East.
The need for faster service was of no small concern to business leaders
in the East and West. <BR>
<BR>
The New York and Lake Erie Railroad was chartered in 1832 with the understanding
that it would bypass Buffalo (and snub the canal) and terminate at a point
farther down Lake Erie. Dunkirk, NY was selected because it was a well established
lake port with a good natural harbor and available land for yards,shops
and freight houses close to the docks. <BR>
<BR>
Construction of the railroad, however, was very slow and operations were
often suspended until additional financing could be obtained.In an effort
to speed completion at the western end of the line, the company sent the
first locomotive to Dunkirk by the only practical means at that time; horse
drawn canal barge and lake boat (ugh!). The engineer in charge of the move
was Horatio G. Brooks,and it arrived on November 28, 1850.On May 15, 1851
the first train arrived from New York marking the completion of what was
then the longest railroad in the world with 453 continuous miles of track.
<BR>
<BR>
Activity boomed in the ensuing years but by 1869 the &quot;Erie&quot; Railroad,
pinched by ever increasing competition, felt it necessary to consolidate
some of its facilities and announced the closing of the Dunkirk shops.Engineer
Brooks, who was also a master mechanic, had the respect of both the workers
and management. With the financial backing of four outside investors, Brooks
leased (and later purchased) the soon to be abandoned repair facilities
and expanded the operations to repair and manufacture. <BR>
<BR>
The Brooks Locomotive Works, Horatio G. Brooks, president,was founded on
November 11, 1869.The new company built steam engines for many of the major
railroads in the United States and some foreign countries. <BR>
<BR>
At the Chicago Industrial Exposition in June 1883 Brooks engines were judged
&quot;Best in Show&quot; and, on February 22, 1884, the 1000th engine was
completed.the company grew and prospered until the depression of 1893. Production
fell from 226 locomotives in 1891 to 90 in 1894. Recovery was slow and Brooks
did not regain its previous position in the industry. <BR>
<BR>
In 1901 the Brooks works was acquired by the American Locomotive Company,
&quot;a major manufacturer of single and compound locomotives for all classes
of service&quot;. Facilities were expanded by the new owners and production
increased. The 786 was one of twenty of the Southern Pacific's MK-5 class
locomotives built at the ALCO Brooks Works in August and September of 1916.
<BR>
<BR>
Steam engine manufacturing at Brooks ceased in 1928, an early harbinger
of the end of the steam era in the United States.

<h1>THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS BELIEVES:</h1></center>

<ul>
<li>in representative government and in the individual liberties established in the Constitution of the United States

<li>that democratic government depends upon the informed and active participation of its citizens and requires that government bodies protect the citizen's right to know by giving adequate notice of proposed actions, holding open meetings and making public records accessible

<li>that the right to vote of every citizen should be protected; that every person should have access to free public education that provides equal opportunity for all; and, that no person or group should suffer legal, economic or administrative discrimination

<li>that efficient and economical government requires competent personnel, the clear assignment of responsibility, adequate financing and coordination among the different agencies and levels of government

<li>that responsible government should be responsive to the will of the people; that government should maintain an equitable and flexible system of taxation, promote the conservation and development of natural resources in the public interest, share in the solution of economic and social problems which affect the general welfare, promote a sound economy and adopt domestic policies that facilitate the solution of international problems

<li>that cooperation with other nations is essential in the search for solutions to world problems, and that the development of international organization and international law is imperative in the promotion of world peace.
</ul>

THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF THE AUSTIN AREA<br>
TRANSPORTATION STUDY: Facts and Issues
</H3>


<H3>- BACKGROUND - </H3></CENTER>

Recognizing the significance of local transportation to the quality of 
life in Austin, the League of Women Voters of the Austin Area, 
conducted an intensive study in 1971-72, and published A Study of 
Transportation in Austin.  After reaching  member consensus, the 
League presented its recommendation to the Austin City Council 
strongly supporting a public transportation system to serve the total 
population and urging a forceful public relations effort to create a 
demand for public transportation services.<P>

In the 1970's, League members continued to advocate for convenient, 
low cost publicly owned transportation that would provide for strong 
local control and would relieve peak period traffic congestion. In 
1981, when the Texas legislature provided for the establishment of 
metropolitan transit authorities, the Austin League updated its 1972 
study with the publication of A Metropolitan Transit Authority for 
Austin?  The League then expanded its earlier support of community-
wide transportation to include support for the establishment of a 
permanent mass transit authority funded by a one cent sales tax.<P>

In the light of current major developments in transportation issues, 
League members voted in May 1995, the following restudy of the 
existing transportation positions.<P>

The focus of the study is on local transportation alternatives and 
their environmental, planning, and fiscal implications.
The scope of the study is:<p>
<OL>
<LI> A review of the Austin Metropolitan Area Transportation Plan 
(ATS), extending to the year 2020;
<LI> The increased mobility of people through the use of intermodal 
transportation facilities;
<UL>
<LI> Capital Metro services including: Regional light rail system, 
Park and Ride facilities, Services for the disabled, the elderly, and 
students
<LI>    Automobile and truck traffic
<LI>    Bicycle trails
<LI>    Pedestrian routes
</UL>
<LI> The interrelation of transportation planning with environmental 
concerns and land use; 
<LI> The evaluation of transportation funding and expenditures in the 
Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Austin District, Travis 
County, the City of Austin, and Capital Metro.
</OL>

The current publication is the product of the Austin League of Women 
Voters transportation resource committee’s six months of research.  It 
is not intended to be an exhaustive report but rather the basic 
information that our members and the public require to make informed 
decisions on crucial local transportation issues.<P>
It has become increasingly clear that the Austin metropolitan area is 
at a critical juncture in providing adequate mobility for an 
increasing population.  Federal, state, and local governments have 
developed alternative plans for transportation into the next century 
in response to urban sprawl, environmental, technological, and 
economic factors and heavy reliance on the automobile with resulting 
traffic congestion. Although the focus is on the Austin metropolitan 
area, in order to understand the implications for Austin, the study 
reviews all  levels of government. About 20-30% of the funds come 
through the federal government, which sets many state and local 
requirements and standards.<P>

<H1>History of Girl Scouts</H1>

<P>
Juliette Gordon Low, the founder of Girl Scouts in the United
States, was a remarkable achiever. She set high ideals for the
world and for her fellow women. During a time when women were
restrained by society, Juliette Gordon Low set a precedent for
young women to follow even today.
<P>
Juliette Gordon was born in Savannah, Georgia on Halloween (October
31) in 1860. She was a bright and talented girl known to her friends
and family as Daisy. Her cheerful personality encouraged the respect
of all of her peers, however Juliette had her own cross to bear.
Throughout her life struggles with her hearing gradually worsened,
but Juliette never let these obstacles stand in her way. 
<P>
Juliette later married William Low, an Englishman. Her horizons
were broadened when she went off to live in England and Scotland.
Unfortunately, the marriage was not what had been hoped. William
Low died while preparations for divorce were being undertaken.
After this, Juliette decided it was time to see the world. She
eventually settled in Paris where she planned to study sculpture.
However, a new acquaintance, Sir Robert (later Lord) Baden-Powell,
set her life in an entirely new direction.
<HR ALIGN=CENTER SIZE=6 WIDTH=75%>

<P>
Sir Robert was a former English General and war hero. He started
the Boy Scout movement in 1908 and met Juliette Gordon Low three
years later. He and his sister had a tremendous impact on Juliette
in their involvement with the new generation.
<P>
Boy Scouts had become tremendously popular and had spread to several
countries besides England at this time. However, the young women
in England began to feel the need for similar organizations among
themselves. Several of these type of groups were organized by
young ladies into clubs similar to the Boy Scouts. When Sir Robert
learned of the thriving interest in scouting among young women,
he asked his sister, Agnes, to form an organization for them.
Girl Guides were thus established in 1910. The next year there
were Girl Guide or Scout organizations in Australia, South Africa,
and Finland. By 1912 it had spread even further, into Sweden,
Denmark, Poland, and Canada.
<P>
This new movement of Girl Guides/Scouts was exactly what Juliette
Gordon Low had been searching for. She became very involved in
it, even moving back to Scotland to lead a troop. However, Juliette
realized that the young women in the United States were missing
a wonderful opportunity. She promptly returned home to Savannah
where she called a friend saying, &quot;Come right over. I've
got something for the girls of Savannah, and all America, and
all the world, and we're going to start it tonight.&quot;
<HR ALIGN=CENTER SIZE=6 WIDTH=75%>

<P>
In 1912, women were facing many old struggles. Their education
was limited and so were their futures. However, as the dawn of
World War I approached women realized that their role was a vital
one. Organizations such as Girl Scouts and Girl Guides were especially
important at this time to the development of a new, stronger,
and more gifted young woman.
<P>
The first troop meeting of Girl Scouts in the United States was
held in Savannah on March 12, 1912.Juliette Low's girls were able
to contribute to the war effort in their community. These young
women were able to actively participate as valued citizens who
were concerned about their future.
<P>
The first American Girl Scout handbook was written by Walter John
Hoxie, a naturalist. This book reflected many stereotypes of the
time, making many references to the arts of &quot;housewivery.&quot;
However, there was a marked emphasis on ecology and physical fitness
which attended to the promise of a new American girl in the years
to come. In 1916, Juliette Low adapted a newer version of the
Girl Scout Handbook. This book included an aviation badge, a new
height for the all girl organization.
<P>
Juliette Low was a firm believer in letting the girls run their
own troops. Adults involved in the troops were advisers, not leaders.
When she died on January 18, 1927 she inspired the founding of
the Juliette Low World Friendship Fund. This organization uses
its money to send American girls to other countries and bring
other girls to visit the United States.

<H1>Girl Scout Traditions</H1>

<H3>Girl Scout Sign</H3>

<P>
The sign is formed by holding down the thumb and little finger
on the right hand, leaving the three middle fingers extended.
These three fingers represent the three parts of the <A HREF="promise.htm">Girl Scout Promise</A>.
<HR ALIGN=CENTER SIZE=6 WIDTH=75%>

<H3>Girl Scout Handshake</H3>

<P>
This is the way many Girl Scouts and Girl Guides greet each other.
They shake their left hands while making the Girl Scout sign with
their right hand. The left handed handshake represents friendship
because the left hand is closer to the heart than the right. 
<HR ALIGN=CENTER SIZE=6 WIDTH=75%>

<H3>Quiet Sign</H3>

<P>
In order to maintain order at lively Girl Scout functions, the
leader raises her right hand for silence. The girls follow in
the motion; as their hands go up, the conversation stops, until
everyone has their hand up and the room is silent.
<HR ALIGN=CENTER SIZE=6 WIDTH=75%>

<H3>Friendship Circle</H3>

<P>
The friendship circle is often formed at the end of meetings or
campfires as a sort of closing ceremony. Everyone gathers in a
circle where they cross their right arm over their left in front
of them and hold hands with the people on either side. Once everyone
is silent, the leader starts the <B>friendship squeeze</B> which
is passed from hand to hand. Often the girls will make a wish
after their hand has been squeezed before they pass the squeeze
along. Also, in some larger groups, the girls put their right
foot out into the circle when they receive the friendship squeeze,
so that everyone can see it travel along the circle.

<H1>Girl Scout Gold Award</H1>

<P>
<IMG SRC="gold-awd.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
<P>
The Girl Scout Gold Award is the highest award available to Girl
Scouts. It is the equivalent of the Eagle Award in Boy Scouts
and is earned as a <A HREF="division.htm">Senior Girl Scout</A>,
as opposed to the <A HREF="silver.htm">Silver Award</A>, which
is earned as a <A HREF="division.htm">Cadette</A>. The preliminary
requirements for the project are: earn four interest project patches,
earn the Career Exploration pin, earn the Senior Girl Scout Leadership
Award, and earn the Senior Girl Scout Challenge. These prerequisites
may be completed in any order, but they must be finished before
beginning on the gold award project. Below are some basic guidelines
to help every girl develop a project that reflects her talents
and what she has learned through Girl Scouts:
<OL>
<LI>Design a project that will meet an expressed need in the community.
<LI>Try and go beyond the Girl Scout community, choose something
that affects people outside of Girl Scouts.
<LI>Select a project advisor/consultant outside of your troop
leader or guardian. This person should be able to help you get
organized and give you advice if you come across any stumbling
blocks.
<LI>Feel free to enlist others to assist you in your project,
but be sure that it is your leadership that makes everything work
smoothly.
<LI>Be aware of necessary costs you may run into. Create a budget
for your project. Girl Scouts cannot raise money for other organizations,
so be sure to check with your council before acting on the budget.
<LI>Your project must take a minimum of 50 hours. Keep a record
of the dates, times, and what you did, so when you send in your
application for the Gold Award, you will have the necessary documentation
of your work. 
<LI>If your project is ongoing, be sure to organize a way that
the project may be continued after you.
<LI>Always check <I>Safety-Wise</I> and be sure to abide by the
guidelines listed therein.

<H1>Wider Opportunities</H1>

<P>
Wider opportunities are events with nationwide or international
participation where registered <A HREF="divisions.htm">Cadette and Senior Girl Scouts</A>
have the chance to travel and learn about different places and
people. There is a magazine, <I>Wider Ops</I>, which lists the
different trips available each year. These wider opportunities
can last from seven to 21 days. These trips are aimed toward a
variety of age levels and interests. Some opportunities have special
requirements, so it is important to check and see that you are
eligible before you apply. 
<HR ALIGN=CENTER SIZE=6 WIDTH=75%>

<H2>Wider Opportunities with Nationwide Participation</H2>

<P>
The costs for wider opportunities with Nationwide participation
this year varies between $325 and $898. This fee does not include
air fare to and from the event or special equipment costs. Check
with your local Girl Scout council to see if they offer any financial
aid. If they don't, they will probably have some good fundraising
ideas. The deadline for application is December 15, 1995, but
your materials must be sent to the local council first, so check
with council for their application deadline. You also need to
be interviewed by the local council, so be sure to sign up for
this. When you are selecting people as references, choose those
adults who know you the best and think very highly of you. It
may be a good idea to send one or two more references than are
required, if you know the adults who have a good opinion of you.
When you hand out reference forms, remember to include a stamped
envelope addressed to your council. Once you have sent in your
application, just relax. If you are not accepted to your first
choice there is the &quot;Operation Second Chance,&quot; where
they send it along to your second and third choices which you
could be selected for, if they are not already filled up. Check

<H2>Wider Opportunities with International Participation</H2>

<P>
International Wider Ops require a special application form which
needs two references: one from Girl Scouts and the other from
an adult outside of Girl Scouts. You must be a registered Girl
Scout between the ages of 14 and 17 to apply. Every January an
international wider opportunity task group selects girls for specific
international opportunities and the rest of the applications are
placed in an international candidates' pool. You may be picked
from this pool at any time during the next year. International
Wider Opportunities can take place in Mexico, the Caribbean, Switzerland,
India, England, Australia, and many other places.

Anytime you visit a site a LOT of information is revealed about you that you may not be aware of
or want revealed. Visit this site to learn about what your surfing habits are telling
others and use it to surf anonymously.

<H3><A HREF="http://www.twc.state.tx.us">Texas Workforce Commission</A></H3>
Texas' newest agency combines the Employment Commission and workforce programs from the
Department of Human Services, Commerce Department and others agencies.

<BR>

Lots of good information -- job listings (TWC Job Express, Governor's Job Bank, 
America's Job Bank), general information for veterans, 
unemployed people who are filing for unemployment, employment law, demographic labor market 
information, proprietary schools, links to child care and child information sites,

<H2>Texas travel information </H2>
<H3><A HREF="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us">Parks and Wildlife Department</A></H3>

<H3> <A HREF="http://www.traveltex.com/">TravelTexas Information</A> </H3>
Good resource of information for planning a Texas vacation.

<H2>General Health and Safety</H2>

<H3><A HREF="http://web2.airmail.net/marystod">Aspartame Consumer Safety Network</A> </H3>
This site details the health risks and many symptoms/diseases that Aspartame, sold as 
NutraSweet and Equal, can cause or aggravate. It also includes stories from pilots who
lost their licenses because of medical problems caused by Aspartame. This information is a
real eye opener; everyone should read it, especially pregnant women, anyone 
with health problems, and anyone who knows someone with health problems or expecting a baby--or
who wants to avoid potential health problems of their own.

<H3><A HREF="http://yellodino.safe-t-child.com">Safe-T-Child </A></H3>
Excellent site to learn about laws related to abducted and molested children. Test your
child's "stranger danger" IQ, and find out how to order the book NOT MY CHILD! which 
details the tricks of molesters and other predators plus gives action steps on how you can
convey that information to your children, from preschoolers to teenagers. Both the book and
other information at this site are highly recommended by this parent/webmaster.

meeting</H3>

<P>It's hard to believe but the elections for the 1996 officers are right
around the corner. They will be held at the February meeting. If you are
interested in becoming an officer, contact any of the <A HREF="index.htm#Officers">current
officers</A>. The main requirement for being an officer is a resident who
wants to keep Northwood a good place to live and is willing to work for
that. </P>

<P>Of course, you do not have to be an officer to be involved in the neighborhood
association. The activities area can use lots of help for individual activities,
such as the picnic. Barbara, the current VP of Activities has done much
of the work herself; there is more than enough to share! <BR>

<H3><A NAME="preston_oaks"></A>Preston Oaks Lot Preparation</H3>

<P>The site preparation for Preston Oaks continues. The developer is getting
the land ready to build new homes probably starting early next year. They
have been digging the retention pond, knocking down trees that need to
be removed, cutting roads, and a temporary entrance at Ganymede, where
the main entrance to the subdivision will be.<BR>
</P>

<P>Some residents may be tempted to explore the Preston Oaks area to check
on the developer's progress. However, please do not do so. This is a construction
site and there are dangers. Stay out of Preston Oaks and stay safe. </P>

<H3><A NAME="traffic_light"></A>Traffic Light at 1325 and Scofield Ridge</H3>

<P>Even though there were not enough serious accidents at the intersection
of 1325 and Scofield, north of us, for the City to decide to install and
activate a traffic light, that has been done. (The City must balance the
impact on through traffic as well as cross traffic when considering a light.)
Many thanks to Elliott Naishtat and others for all their hard work to get
the light installed and activated. </P>

<H3><A NAME="Hydrolab_for_sale"></A>For Sale Property at front of Oak Creek</H3>

<P>Several acres on Oak Creek next to the back yards of homes on Pegasus
are for sale. The sign indicates it is light industrial zoning. That category
of zoning had been granted when HydroLab bought the tract. Our understanding
was that the zoning would be rolled back to the previous SF6, which would
allow duplexes or townhomes. So far, nothing has happened in this area.
We will continue to monitor. </P>

<H3><A NAME="tetco_car_wash"></A>Car Wash Behind Tetco</H3>

<P>The Tetco gas station across Parmer wants to add a drive through car
wash behind the store. This would require changing zoning from LO (light
office) to GR (general retail). Both our board and the Milwood neighborhood
board have agreed to this. </P>

<H3><A NAME="speed_humps"></A>Speed Humps Issue</H3>

<P>Many residents who live on Oak Creek, Silver Creek and Tamarack are
concerned about the danger of speeding vehicles and want a way to slow
down the traffic. </P>

<UL>
<LI>One option being considered is speed humps, which are permanently in
place. </LI>

<LI>Another option is to ask for increased enforcement of speed limits
from the Police Department, which will impact their existing resources.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>If we decide to ask the City for speed humps, that will affect the neighborhood
for many years to come. We want to be sure everyone has a chance to voice
their opinion. More on that in a bit.<BR>
</P>

<P><I>Description</I> <BR>
If you have never driven over speed <U>h</U>umps, they are very different
from speed <U>b</U>umps that many private parking lots use. They are lower
(about 3-4 inches high) and much wider (12-22 feet), so vehicles slow down,
not stop, to go over them safely. They are called &quot;sleeping policemen&quot;
since they effectively slow down traffic, just like a radar trap. Unlike
a radar trap, they are always there. They extend across the entire width
of the street so that cars do not swerve close to the curbs to avoid driving
over the hump. </P>

<P><I>Paying for speed humps</I> <BR>
One important issue is who will pay for the humps. Each hump costs about
$2,500. If the City agrees there is a need, they will pay for the speed
humps...until they run out of money. There is competition for City funds.
</P>

<P>The developer of Preston Oaks, Milburn, has said they would contribute
$10,000 for speed humps (approximately 4 humps). The City must approve
this before any work can be done. In addition, if we request more than
4 humps, the City must budget money for them. </P>

<P><I>Issues</I> <BR>
The general <U>proposed</U> location for the humps are: </P>

<UL>
<LI>2-4 on Oak Creek between the second entrance of Pegasus and past the
second blind curve. </LI>

<LI>1-3 on Silver Creek between Beaconsdale and Tamarack. </LI>

<LI>Possibly 1 on Tamarack. </LI>
</UL>

<P>The number of humps as well as their location will depend on how much
money is available. </P>

<P>The speed hump issue will be discussed at the February general meeting--watch
the next newsletter for more details. We very much want to reach a consensus
on this and avoid dividing the neighborhood into two or more factions.
</P>

<P>If you know of anyone who lives in a neighborhood with speed humps and
would be willing to share their experiences at the February meeting, please
e-mail the <A HREF="index.htm#editor">editor </A>


<P><I>Effect on emergency vehicles</I> <BR>
<I>Fire trucks: </I>Regarding the effect on fire trucks, the Fire Chief
said the speed humps only add 30-40 seconds to response time and they will
support whatever we want. <BR>
We have not heard from EMS. 

<P><I>Other considerations and questions</I> ============= </P>

<P><I>Do people drive too fast in Northwood? </I>Many people say Yes, at
least one or two have said No. This may depend in part on where you live,
since this affects what cars you see. </P>

<P><I>What are other options?</I> <BR>
One alternative to speed humps is to request speed traps. This requires
a policeman to be stationed in the neighborhood instead of patrolling the
streets. In addition, the officer could not be here all the time. This
would have some effect, and how long would it last? </P>

<P>Some people have suggested listing in the newsletter descriptions of
cars that are seen speeding repeatedly. However, this has negative implications
and possibly undesirable repercussions; people rarely appreciate being
embarrassed. </P>

<P><I>What have residents said so far?</I> <BR>
Here's what several residents e-mailed to the editor: </P>

<P><B><U>For</U> speed humps:</B> <BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">"I live on Oak Creek Drive (near the front)
and have a small grandchild. I am concerned about her safety and that of
other children I see on the curb side playing or waiting for a school bus.
People do speed and the traffic on Oak Creek seems to increase daily.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">&quot;One and one-half years ago my neighbor was
hit by a speeding car, taken to the hospital and treated for injuries.
He could have been killed and he continues to have problems with his hand
as a result of the accident.</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">&quot;I am very much in favor of the speed humps
particularly around the two blind curves coming into our subdivision from
FM 1325.&quot;</FONT> </P>

<P><B><U>Against</U>:</B> One resident who lives on Oak Creek past Silver
Creek very strongly opposes speed humps: </P>

<P>&quot;<FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Accidents will happen and I am as concerned
as anyone that they do, but by far, the majority of the drivers using our
neighborhood streets drive safely. Police speed traps catch the speeders
and we have had this deterrent before. It was so effective that the victims'
complaints to the City got them stopped. </FONT></P>

<P>&quot;<FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">I still am not convinced that we have a serious
traffic problem in this neighborhood. I drive through plenty of other neighborhoods
in Austin where the majority is driving 45-50 mph on streets where the
posted speed is 30 mph. Unlike streets like Enfield Rd., Jefferson St.,
Koenig Ln. or Shoal Creek, the traffic in Northwood is terminating traffic;
not through traffic. (I know it has been said that there is some through
traffic, but I don't see it.</FONT> </P>

<P>&quot;<FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Speed humps are the enemy to emergency
vehicles, particularly fire and ambulance. Studies on emergency response
personnel have shown that each speed hump encountered delays response time
an average of 8 seconds. And in the case of EMS, treatment can not start
until all the speed humps have been cleared.</FONT> </P>

<P>&quot;<FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">I implore the decision makers in this neighborhood
to think long and hard about the severity of our situation before asking
for something as permanent as speed humps. Wouldn't it be prudent to try
everything else we can do, first?</FONT>&quot; </P>

<P><B><U>Effect on Tamarack</B></U> One resident on Tamarack had concerns about
the effect on the traffic on that street: </P>

<P>&quot;<FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">The homes on Tamarack nearest Beaconsdale are
home to 13 children between the ages of 2 and 12. This area has become
dangerous in the last several months and is getting worse. If speed humps
are placed on Silver Creek and/or Oak Creek, the number of vehicles on
Tamarack will increase to avoid the humps. </FONT></P>

<P>&quot;<FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Speeders are the biggest issue in this area,
followed by vehicles cutting the left turn from Tamarack onto Beaconsdale
and Palomar. Most of the offenders are not occasional or random. They are
the same vehicles and drivers consistently. </FONT></P>

<P>&quot;<FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">We would like to know if the study will include
the effects of the humps on Tamarack? Tamarack is the other through street
into and out of Northwood and most certainly will be impacted.</FONT> </P>

<P>&quot;<FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">We would also like to suggest the addition
of a column in the neighborhood newsletter for neighborhood policing. It
would not be an effective or practical use of the Austin Police Department
to post vehicles in the area for speeders. We would much rather see the
man power used to police crime, drugs and gangs. If a driver sees their
vehicle's description posted in the newsletter for not obeying speed limits,
maybe they will slow down before they hurt or kill a child. Also, if drivers
are observed and commended for obeying speed limits, maybe others will
follow.</FONT>&quot; </P>

<P><B><I>What's your opinion?</I></B> <BR>
These are the opinions of several residents. What do you think? Please
let the board know--we want to avoid having only a few people make the
decision. There are several ways you can let your voice be heard. When
you do, please also include your name and phone number, so we can contact
you to follow up and continue the discussion. </P>

<OL>
<LI>Write your opinions and ideas on the <A HREF="#speed_suggestions">form </A>at the end of this newsletter,
print it and put it in the Association mailbox. </LI>

<LI>E-mail the editor at <A href="MAILTO:lenny@bga.com">lenny@bga.com. </A>
You may use the survey at the back
of this newsletter. </LI>

<LI>Attend the February general meeting. </LI>
</OL>

<P><B><I>Future steps<BR>
</I></B>If most residents are in favor of speed humps, the next step is
to get a petition together, obtain enough signatures and submit it to the
City. To do this we will need volunteers to get the correct petition format,
walk the petitions (they will also be in a future newsletter if appropriate)
and work with City engineers and residents to determine the exact position
of the humps. </P>

<P><B><I>Existing speed humps</I></B> </P>

<P>There are speed humps in at least four locations in north Austin: </P>

<OL>
<LI>On Jefferson Street between 30<SUP>th</SUP> and 34<SUP>th</SUP> Street.
This is parallel to MoPac and just east of it. </LI>

<LI>The entrance to Northwest Park has two. From Burnet turn onto Greenlawn
(near Justin) then go left onto Daugherty and take the first right, Albata.
</LI>

<LI>Richcreek between Burnet and Woodrow has several humps. </LI>

<LI>Collinfield off Payton Gin (near Lanier High School) also has some
humps. </LI>
</OL>

<P>If you have never driven over speed humps, we strongly encourage you
to drive over these and see what you think. <I>Editor's note: </I>I drove
over the humps on Richcreek in a compact car at 30 mph--<U>without</U>
slowing down--and had no problems at all. Different size vehicles may react
a bit differently. Drive over them and see for yourself. </P>

<P><I>Cast your vote</I> <BR>
We will also discuss this at the general meeting on the third Wednesday
of February; watch the next newsletter for details. Everyone will have
to drive over the humps every day! Now is the time to decide if they are
the answer for Northwood. And remember, we have accomplished some important
things because we all pulled together. Let's remember our goals and work
together to find the best answer for Northwood. <P>

<H3><A NAME="watch_tree_trimmers"></A>Oak Wilt:Watch Tree Trimmers</H3>

<P>In the last few months a tree company has solicited residents door to
door, saying they will trim trees. Some residents used this company and
found they were very lax about painting wounds on oak trees. Frequently
they only painted the large wounds and ignored the small ones, leaving
them vulnerable to the sap beetle, which carries the oak wilt virus. One
resident noted this, called them and made them come back and paint the
rest of the wounds they had made. </P>

<P>If you have a tree company trim your oak trees, be sure they paint <I>all</I>
the wounds <I>immediately</I>. This will reduce the risk of oak wilt. </P>

<H3><A NAME="oak_wilt_and_firewood"></A>Oak Wilt and firewood</H3>

<P>Now that cool weather is here, many families are buying firewood. To
prevent the start of oak wilt, we need to be careful when buying firewood
as well as when pruning oak trees.<BR>
</P>

<P>Here are a few tips on buying firewood and pruning oak trees: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Buy only dry firewood and only buy as much as you will burn this year.
Dry firewood is much lighter in weight than firewood that is not dry. </LI>

<LI>Cover firewood with clear plastic. The sap beetle (the main carrier
of the disease) cannot see the pinholes and escape through them. </LI>

<LI>Only prune oak trees when the weather has been bitter cold (or very
hot) for an extended period of time. This is the time of year that the
sap beetle is the least active. </LI>

<LI>If you wound a tree in any way, such as by pruning or hitting it with
the lawn mower, <I>immediately</I> paint the wound. If you hire a company
to trim your trees, insist they do the same. They should paint a limb <U>immediately</U>
after cutting it. </LI>
</UL>

<P>For more information, call the City Oak Wilt Hotline at 472-7606. </P>

<H3><A NAME="new_church"></A>New Church Welcomes Neighbors</H3>

<P>A new Methodist church is meeting close to our neighborhood. It is called
Wells Branch Community Church and is located at 2113 Wells Branch Parkway,
close to Ropers. This is a warm, friendly group and they are eager to increase
their membership; there are presently about 30 members. Sunday service
is at 10:45 a.m. and there is a Wednesday evening Bible study at 7 p.m.

garage sale will be from September 21 through October 4. The registration
form is in the back of the newsletter.

<H2>Zoning and Development </H2>

<H3><A NAME="preston_oaks">Preston Oaks at Northwood Update</A>
</H3>

<P>
The latest information about the new subdivision, Preston Oaks
at Northwood, was discussed at the August meeting. 
<UL>
<LI>We had wanted the sizes of the lots adjoining Northwood to
be closer in size to ours, but the developer has refused to consider
that. They will remain at about 50' wide (Northwood lots are 70-85').
We have also talked to the Planning Commission; they say the builder
is staying inside the zoning limits and the differences are not
unrealistic. One advantage of smaller lot sizes means that there
will be more houses on a block and people with new neighbors behind
them won't be looking directly into a house.
<LI>We will ask the builder to put up signs saying &quot;Contractors
use Ganymede&quot; to keep the construction trucks and other traffic
off Northwood streets. We are going to ask for a construction
entrance directly off Parmer. There is no way to prevent construction
pickup trucks from coming from 1325 to Oak Creek to the new subdivision.
We want to limit or restrict the heavy trucks.
<LI>The retention pond should be available for use as a soccer
field. There will be no bleachers or lights, just an open area
at the corner of War Path and Tamarack that may be used for soccer
games. 
</UL>

<P>
They are preparing the lots for the homes and may begin building
late this year or early next year.

<H3><A NAME="hydrolab_sale">HydroLab property for sale </A></H3>
<P>
Austin HydroLab, currently located across FM 1325, bought some
of the land between the back yards of homes on Pegasus and the
mini storage several years ago and rezoned it as Light Industrial.
They had planned to move there when TxDOT condemned their current
building for the future MoPac extension. 
<P>
A broker recently contacted one of the officers to say the property
is for sale. We understand there is a condition in the sale of
the property that it roll back to SF3 zoning (Northwood is SF2,
a slightly lower density). We are monitoring this situation. 

<p>

<H2>Neighborhood Notes </H2>

<H3><A NAME="traffic_concerns">Traffic concerns--fast cars, speed
humps </A></H3>

<P>
There is some increased traffic in Northwood that is not related
to the new subdivision. Apparently some Cedar Park people are
using Oak Creek/Silver Creek to bypass the traffic on Parmer by
MoPac. One resident on Oak Creek counted 149 cars in 45 minutes
one evening.
<P>
One way to slow down and discourage cut through traffic is to
install speed humps (not bumps; humps slow traffic down and do
not damage vehicles driving at legal speeds.) The problem is not
only caused by cut through traffic; many teen age and adult residents
are driving <U>far</U> too fast while children are playing in
the streets. We have not yet had any serious injuries or fatalities;
all drivers need to <I>slow down</I> before a tragedy happens.
One resident was hit by a car over a year ago, had to be rushed
to the hospital and still has problems with his hand.
<P>
We have requested a 4-way stop sign at Oak Creek and Silver Creek;
ironically, the lack of fatalities moves us lower on the waiting
list for a traffic study. 
<P>
The neighbors would like 2 or 3 humps on Oak Creek and 3 on Silver
Creek. However, there are some issues that must be resolved.
<UL>
<LI>The Fire Department can veto speed humps if they believe they
would interfere with their response time to a fire-a few seconds
delay in response time can make a huge difference. Roy Waley will
talk to the fire chiefs to find out if they have objections to
the humps. 
<LI>Each hump costs about $2,500; the city only pays if they agree
the humps are needed. 
<LI>We will have to walk the neighborhood getting petitions for
the speed humps signed. We are working on getting builder assistance
to obtain the speed humps. Even so, we will probably be low on
the speed hump waiting list. 
</UL>
<P>
If a traffic engineer lives in the neighborhood and is willing
to help with some traffic questions, please call one of the officers.

<p>
<A HREF="#top"> <IMG SRC="gototop.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <BR> 

<H3><A NAME="speeding_school_buses">Speeding school buses </A></H3>
<P>
At the August meeting some residents voiced concerns about school
buses that speed through the neighborhood streets. If you see
a school bus traveling too fast or driving in any unsafe way,
jot down the bus number and call an <A HREF="index.htm#officers">officer</A>;
they will forward it to the resident who is collecting that information
and will talk to AISD. 

<H3><A NAME="leash_law">Leash law in Austin </A></H3>
<P>
Just a reminder: Austin does have a leash law for dogs. An ordinance
states that a dog not inside a building or in an enclosure must
be on a leash not more than 6 feet long. It is a Class C misdemeanor
to have a dog running at large, which means not under the direct
physical control. Loose dogs, especially large ones, concern some
of the many people who walk the neighborhood.

<p>
<A HREF="#top"> <IMG SRC="gototop.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <BR> 

<H3><A NAME="bicycle_law">Bicycle helmet law in effect-safe cycling</A></H3>
<P>
There is a new law in effect: <U>everyone</U> riding a bicycle
must wear a helmet. Many people opposed the law at City Council
hearings; however they may be ignoring the facts. 
<P>
According to the August 1996 issue of <I>Parents</I> magazine,
when a cyclist with no helmet falls and hits their head, the sudden
impact can result in a skull fracture, blood on the brain, coma
or death. Even a slight head injury can affect memory, possibly
leading to memory and behavior problems. A helmet seems like a
small price to pay to prevent a head injury. And who can predict
when they will fall and hit their head?
<P>
Currently the fines are fairly stiff for helmetless riders. Be
sure that you and your children always wear an approved helmet--look
for a sticker indicating it was tested by the Snell Memorial Foundation,
the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) or the American
Society of Testing Materials (ASTM). Also be sure it fits snugly.
If a child or adult is between sizes, buy the larger size and
use foam pads to fill the extra space.
<p>
<A HREF="#top"> <IMG SRC="gototop.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <BR> 

<H3><A NAME="curfew">Children's curfew </A></H3>
<P>
One way to cut down on malicious mischief by juveniles is for
parents to encourage their children to follow curfew laws. For
children under 17 years old, weeknights (Sunday to Thursday) curfew
is 11:30 p.m. to 6 a.m. Weekends (Friday/Saturday), summer and
school holidays curfew is 12:30 a.m. to 6 a.m. 
<P>
If you see children breaking the curfew, especially if it's the
same children repeatedly, consider calling the police (911). 

<p>
<A HREF="#top"> <IMG SRC="gototop.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <BR> 

<H3><A NAME="latchkey_children">Logistics of Latchkey Children</A></H3>
<P>
<I>This is from the Work &amp; Family column in the August 14,
1996 Wall Street Journal</I>
<P>
The column editor wrote a column on latchkey children and then
published some of the mail. One former latchkey child, now a psychologist,
wrote &quot;As an adult I have come to understand the incredible
anger I had toward my parents when they left me alone... I recognize
that child care is difficult for many families. But asking kids
to stay home alone after school essentially says 'Hey, be your
own parent. I have lots of stuff to do.' What message does the
child receive from that?
<P>
The column's editor notes that 2 tests apply to leaving children
alone on a regular basis: 
<OL>
<LI>Is the child <U>truly</U> safe?
<LI>Is the setup denying the child enough good parenting that
is necessary for a child to thrive? Children need a delicate blend
of adult love, guidance, discipline, acceptance, emotional involvement
and encouragement while they are children. 
</OL>

<P>
If your child must spend time home alone on a regular basis, ask
yourself these questions and take a close look at the answers.
<p>
<A HREF="#top"> <IMG SRC="gototop.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <BR> 

<H3><A NAME="kids_cleaning">Kids and Cleaning up </A></H3>
<P>
<I>This is from the same Wall Street Journal column as the latchkey children</I>
<P>
Many parents of two-income families tend to not expect their children
to help with regular chores around the house; one column focused
on that trend. As one reader responded, &quot;What's missing is
teaching kids responsibility. I have to conclude the parents you
researched are fools. It's not a matter of clean toilet bowls
but assuming responsibility for oneself. Parents who do the dirty
work so the child can become &#133;a top honor student are imparting
a false sense of self-importance and maybe a feeling of superiority
to the parents at home cleaning the toilets.
<P>
<I>Editor's note:</I> after reading the column, we started involving
our young children more in the regular household chores. Yes,
it takes longer to clean (at least at first), but it can also
help build the idea of the family as a team-and that is well worth
the extra time. 

<H3><A NAME="trash_cigarettes">Trash Cigarette Butts Safely </A></H3>
<P>
If you smoke, think before you toss a cigarette butt on the ground.
Is it somewhere a small child could pick it up? One mother wrote
to Ann Landers that her little boy's mouth was burned when he
put in his mouth a lit cigarette butt that he found on a playground.
Please be careful where you toss the butts! Small children may
eat them. (And remember the fire hazard.)

<H2>Health Hints </H2>

<H3><A NAME="vitamins_minerals">Vitamins and Minerals </A></H3>
<P>
<I>This information was taken from the June, 1996 NATURALLY HEALTHY
MAGAZINE, written by Joseph Johnson</I>
<P>
Both minerals and vitamins are needed for good health, and minerals
are even more important than vitamins. Lacking vitamins, the body
can make some use of minerals, but without minerals, the vitamins
can't be used.
<P>
The problem is that you cannot get all the minerals your body
needs by eating a well balanced diet. They simply are not present
in the soil. In <U>1936</U>, Senate Document #264 warned Americans
that the soils used to grow our food were seriously deficient
in minerals. The 1992 World Health Summit in Rio confirmed this
fact. They have been absorbed by crops over the decades and have
simply not been replaced.
<P>
So can't we just take mineral supplements to replace the missing
minerals? This sounds good but it this does not guarantee that
the body can absorb and use the minerals. There are 3 ways to
take minerals: 
<OL>
<LI>metallic minerals-are only 5-15% absorbable. Most minerals
supplements found in stores fall into this category. They carry
a positive electrical charge, which makes them hard to break down
in the body. Dangerous (toxic) levels of metallic minerals can
accumulate in the body and cause health problems.
<LI>Chelated minerals-are 50% absorbable. They also carry a positive
electrical charge.
<LI>Organic colloidal bio-electrical trace minerals-are nearly
100% absorbable because they have already been processed by ancient
plants. Through photosynthesis they acquired a negative electrical
charge, which makes them more absorbable and usable by the body.
</OL>
<P>
Colloidals are microscopic-sized electrically negative charged
particles that are 7,000 times smaller than a red blood cell.
They are like a magnet, helping to pull broken-down cells into
the bloodstream to be eliminated. They are only colloidal in liquid
form.
<P>
They comprise all the necessary elements which should be present
in the body to maintain a bio-electric balance needed for good
health. This ties into the &quot;whole health&quot; theory, which
considers the entire body. 
<P>
Planning on taking mineral supplements? Here is a caveat: if only
some minerals are taken, it may cause a serious deficiency of
some missing minerals, especially those that the supplemented
minerals need to work with. And this could cause health problems.
Check with a nutritionally aware medical expert before you start
taking supplements of just a few minerals-there are over 60 minerals
used by the body, and many of them work together in many ways.
<P>
Mr. Johnson (<A NAME="johnson_phone">338-9613 or 800-437-8640</A>)
can send you a free copy of an audio tape of a lecture by Dr.
Joel Wallach, a 1991 Nobel prize nominee, who is known as the
mineral doctor. The tape, <I>Dead Doctors Don't Lie,</I> discusses
the importance of minerals and vitamins in our diets. (Editor's
note: the tape is worth listening to just to find out how it was
named!) 
<P>
<I>The following information is from the tape. </I>Dr. Wallach
is both a veterinarian and physician. As part of a long-term research
project he did over 17,000 autopsies on animals and 3,000 on humans.
He founds that every animal and person that died of &quot;natural
causes&quot; died from a nutritional deficiency. 
<P>
He lists many diseases that result from mineral and/or vitamin
deficiencies. These include: arthritis, heart attacks, anorexia,
Alzheimer's, osteoporosis, PMS and others. He also states that
many of these diseases can be prevented or cured by giving the
body the correct building blocks-minerals and vitamins. They are
commonly cured in animals with sufficient minerals. 
<P>
One example from the tape: a symptom of copper deficiency is gray
hair. Copper affects the elasticity of blood vessels. According
to Dr. Wallach, a possible result of a copper deficiency is a
vascular aneurysm. 

<H4>Discovery of colloidal minerals</H4>

<P>
In 1925 a Utah rancher made an accidental discovery of an preserved
ancient rain forest. This rain forest contains colloidal minerals
of the type the human body has evolved to use. These are now available
by mail order; contact <A HREF="#johnson_phone" >Joe Johnson. </A>
<P>
<I>Editor's note: this article is for information, it is NOT a
sales pitch. I found the information in the magazine and the tape
very interesting and simply wanted to let others know about it.

<P>
The Texas Education Agency has released their ratings of public
schools in areas across the state. To find out how your school
rated, visit their <A HREF="http://www.tea.state.tx.us" >web site </A>and
search for the Austin schools. (Hint: if you see a school with a low rating, 
take it with a grain or three of salt. That school might have just missed the next higher
category by a tiny amount.)

<H3><A NAME="campbell_labels">Saving Campbell's Labels for Education</A></H3>
<P>
If you eat Campbell's products (soup, beans, Mrs. Paul's frozen
seafood, Pace picante sauce, etc.) please save your labels. The
PTA at Will Davis Elementary collects them. Campbell's gives credit
for the labels for buying educational equipment. If you have labels
to donate, either drop them off at the school office or contact

<P>
We did not receive the police report in time to include it in
this issue. It will be included in the next newsletter.
<P>
If you are aware of a theft or other problem, contact the editor.
An anonymous description of the incident will be included in the
Police Report section of the newsletter. 
<P>
One series of incidents has been happening lately: mailboxes on
Palomar, Burr Oak and Tamarack have been vandalized recently,
including since school started. This is presumably the work of
mischievous children. Parents, please talk to your children to
discourage this type of behavior. Remember, tampering with mailboxes
is a federal offense.
<P>
Any time you see a person or vehicle that doesn't seem to belong,
get as detailed a description as possible (especially a license
number for a vehicle) and notify the police of a suspicious person,
vehicle or graffiti or other indications of a gang. 
<P>
If you do not want to have an officer come to Northwood, call
tele-report at 480-5001 to make a report. The incident may seem
like an isolated one to you, but to the police it can be part
of a pattern and could provide them with necessary information.
We all need to have alert eyes and ears and watch out for our
neighbors.

<P>
The neighborhood barbecue has been rescheduled to Sunday, September
29 at Balcones Park (the corner of Amherst and Duval), starting
at 4:00, with dinner at 5:00.
<P>
The barbecue will be provided by Pok-E-Jo's. The cost for adult
Association members is $3.50 and children of members are $2.00
each-you can pay your dues when you buy the tickets. The cost
for adult non-members is $4.50, children are $3.00. Iced tea is
included; if you want other beverages, bring your own. This is
a fun and inexpensive way to treat your family to dinner and meet
your neighbors--bring your lawn chairs. <U>All</U> Northwood residents
are welcome. Because the Association is paying for part of everyone's
dinner, only Northwood residents are invited.
<P>
To sign up, call Barbara Hilliard at 255-0027 between September
1 and noon September 26. needs that much notice to prepare. Sign
up early to make the event happen, we need to meet a minimum number.
Pok-E-Jo's requires a head count in advance. For that reason,
there are no tickets available the day of the barbecue.

<H3><A NAME="Fall_Garage_Sale">Fall Garage Sale October 5 </A></H3>

The sign-up will be held for approximately two weeks before October
6. The cost to participate will be $2.00. The next newsletter
will have tips for sellers and details.

<P>
Milburn Homes is planning to build 188 homes in Preston Oaks,
the tract of land bordered by Council Bluff, Tamarack, Poquoson
and Parmer. Three streets-War Path, Council Bluff and Columbine-will
be extended into the new neighborhood. This means that there will
be additional traffic in Northwood. A map of the new has details.
<P>
We are considering options on how to deal with the additional
traffic, which will especially impact Silver Creek and Oak Creek;
come to the August meeting to find out the details and give the
board your input. This will affect <U>everyone</U>, not just people
who live near the new development.
<P>
The meeting is tentatively scheduled for 6:30 Wednesday, August
21 at Will Davis, with an alternate location being the Police
Department on Lamplight Village on August 20. Watch the boards
for the actual location and date.
<P>
Here is the latest information:
<P>
The name of the development is tentatively PRESTON OAKS AT NORTHWOOD.
Ganymede will be extended across Parmer into Preston Oaks and
will be the main entrance. As mentioned, Columbine, War Path and
Council Bluff will be opened into Preston Oaks.
<P>
Two of the officers, Katherine and Roy, have met with the builder,
Milburn Homes, to discuss issues of concern to us. We want the
lot sizes of the adjoining lots to match lots in Northwood, where
the lots are 70-85 feet wide. However, Milburn is planning lot
sizes of about 50 feet wide for the abutting homes; we are still
expressing our concerns. Milburn is staying within the zoning
limits, so we are limited to requests and persuasion.
<P>
Milburn is <U>considering</U> 1,500-2,200 sq. ft. houses. They
may be 3 sides brick and many will be two story to fit on the
narrower lots.
<P>
They will have a required homeowners association with dues to
care for the common grounds and maintenance of the retention pond.
The retention pond will be one large retention pond located at
the corner of War Path and Tamarack. The goal is to make the grade
(slope) steep enough for it to drain yet not too steep so that
it can be used by soccer games, etc.
<P>
A retention pond will be used because of the expense of connecting
to the regional retention pond. Making the connection would require
tearing up Northwood streets to reach the drains; this would be
expensive.
<P>
One possibility under consideration is for Milburn to build new
privacy fences for the adjoining homes on Tamarack, Poquoson and
Columbine and to help us get speed humps to compensate for the
additional traffic.
<P>
If you have questions, call Roy or attend the August meeting.

<H3><A NAME="Safe_children">Keeping your children safe </A>from
molesters and abductors</H3>
<P>
Take this quiz with your child and see how well they could handle
a confrontation with a predator-a child molester or abductor.
Even preschoolers should be able to answer most of these questions.
No child is too young to be safe from predators. This quiz, and
much more information, is available at <A HREF="http://yellodino.safe-t-child.com">http://yellodino.safe-t-child.com</A>.
<OL>
<LI>Does your child know how to recognize the lures used by &quot;tricky
people?&quot;
<LI>Does your child know HOW and WHEN to say &quot;NO!&quot; to
an older person?
<LI>Does your child know HOW and WHEN to stop talking to a predator?
<LI>Does your child know what to do if someone attempts to take
them using a weapon?
<LI>Does your child know which &quot;stranger&quot; to ask for
help if they are lost?
<LI>Does your child know that an adult asking for directions is
usually a sign of danger?
<LI>Does your child know HOW and WHAT to yell in a dangerous situation?
<LI>Does your child know to tell you if an older person asks them
to keep a secret?
<LI>Does your child know the proper way to ask for help when making
a 911 call?
<LI>Does your child know what to do if confronted by someone with
a badge?
</OL>

<P>
If your child answered &quot;No&quot; to all or some of these
questions, they are at risk. Talk to them and role play possible
situations that could arise when you may not be close to them-at
the mall, outside the house, when overly friendly strangers come
to call... Remember, predators work hard to seem normal, and they
like to work in careers that involve close contact with children.
<P>
Jan Wagner, founder of Safe-T Child, wrote the book <U><I>Not
my Child!</I></U>, <I>30 Simple Ways To Help Prevent Your Child
From Becoming Lost, Missing, Abducted Or Abused. </I>The book
states that there are over 114,000 reported <U>attempted</U> abductions
<U><I>each year</I></U><I>.</I> The Justice Department estimates
there are over 4 <I>million</I> predators in this country.
<P>
<I>Editor's opinion</I> The book, <I>Not My Child</I>, gives excellent
information about a very frightening subject--missing children.
It details the methods of predators and also explains step by
step how you can work with your children to increase their chances
of avoiding predators. As a parent I highly recommend this book.
It should be required reading for all parents, grandparents, godparents,
aunts, uncles... It answers the above quiz questions.
<P>
Safe-T-Child also has other products, including an excellent recording,
<I>Can't Fool Me, </I>of songs that teach children what to do
when confronted by a predator. Children often remember songs more
easily than just words. &quot;What if you see a guy in town who
wants his puppy found. What do you do when he asks for help and
no one is around. Take 3 steps back... then run like the wind.&quot;
(&quot;Tricky People&quot;).
<P>
Be sure your child knows their address and phone number, including
area code. And you should always carry a <U>current</U> picture
of your child with their name, height and weight and any unusual
characteristics (such as a visible birthmark) on the back. If
your child is lost, <I>seconds count</I> and a good picture and
description can make a difference. And how clearly will you be
thinking if your child is missing?

<H3><A NAME="Aspartame">Aspartame: NutraSweet &quot;Equals&quot;
not safe? </A></H3>
<P>
<I>This information is from the <A HREF="http://web2.airmail.net/marystod">Aspartame Consumer Safety Network </A>(ACSN)</I>

<P>
Aspartame, under the names of NutraSweet and Equal is in many
food products, from diet soft drinks to gum to lowfat ice cream
to medicines...the list is seemingly endless.
<P>
Currently, about 78% of all non-drug complaints to the Food and
Drug Administration are about adverse reactions to aspartame,
also called NutraSweet or Equal. At one time, the figure was 85%.
<P>
<I>Symptoms caused by aspartame</I> 
<P>
A <U>partial</U> list includes: decreased vision, pain in the
eyes, decreased tears, ringing in the ears, hearing impairment,
headache, dizziness and unsteadiness, confusion, memory loss,
drowsiness, sleepiness, slurring of speech, numbness and tingling,
tremors, depression, irritability, aggression, anxiety, insomnia,
phobias, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, high blood pressure,
nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, itching, hives, menstrual changes,
weight gain, hair thinning and hair loss, urinary burning and
frequency, excessive thirst, fluid retention, bloating, increased
infection, and even death. Five deaths were reported prior to
1987. The number since then is unknown.
<P>
Aspartame not only causes individual symptoms, it can mimic entire
syndromes. The CFIDS (chronic fatigue and immune deficiency syndrome)
newsletter calls it the &quot;sweet poison, NutraSweet,&quot;
because it can mimic the symptoms of CFIDS. It can also be involved
in carpal tunnel syndrome and arthritis.
<P>
<I>Pilot problems</I> 
<P>
The official Air Force safety magazine, <I>Flying Safety</I> and
the Navy's flight magazine, <I>Navy Physiology</I> have both published
warnings about using aspartame and flying. One airline pilot had
a seizure while flying at 10,000 feet and was grounded. He had
been drinking eight to ten cups of coffee a day sweetened with
Equal, another aspartame compound. Since he quit aspartame, he's
been seizure-free, but he hasn't been allowed to fly. Pilots report
having grand mal seizures in the cockpit of commercial airliners.
Some crash the simulators during &quot;blackout&quot; episodes.
Dozens have lost their jobs due to Aspartame-related medical problems.
(Editor's note: What is the effect on drivers, including truck
drivers, school bus drivers, taxie drivers and everyone else who
drives?)
<P>
Unofficially, the FAA recognized the dangers to pilots, but refuses
to come out with formal warnings. The US Navy and US Air Force
have warned pilots in their safety publications of the dangers
of using the chemical sweetener Aspartame in their diets.
<P>
<I>Chemicals in Aspartame</I> 
<P>
Aspartame contains a number of chemicals.
<UL>
<LI>It has about 10% methanol (wood alcohol), famous for causing
blindness in alcoholics. In the body, methanol metabolizes into
formaldehyde, a neurotoxin (and an embalming fluid); formic acid,
a venom in ant stings; and diketopiperazine, which causes brain
tumors in animals.
<LI>It has aspartic acid (40%) which can cause brain damage in
the developing brain (such as in an unborn baby).
<LI>It also has phenylalanine (50%) which can be neurotoxic and
in some susceptible people will cause seizures.
</UL>

<P>
These chemicals change the ratio of the amino acids in the blood
stream. The <I>mental symptoms </I>that ASP can produce in a person
are thought to be related to the increase in violence and suicides
in our population. The chemicals all have adverse effects, but
not everyone is affected equally. This is why the scientific community
has a hard time evaluating the results.
<P>
<I>Aspartame decomposes easily</I> 
<P>
In July 1983, the National Soft Drink Association presented official
objections to putting aspartame in beverages. One of their objections
reads: &quot;It is well established under Section 402(a)(3) that
a food which contains a decomposed substance... is subject to
seizure by FDA.&quot; It is thoroughly established that at temperatures
over 85 degrees F (including in the body) as well as after a number
of weeks, there's no aspartame left in a soft drink, only breakdown
products.
<P>
<I>Tumors in test animals</I> 
<P>
Many of the test animals fed aspartame developed large tumors.
These were actually cut out, and the animals were returned to
the study.
<P>
<I>Book about Aspartame</I> 
<P>
The book published by the ACSN, DEADLY DECEPTION, includes a reprint
of a scientific paper showing that aspartame aggravates abnormal
brain waves in children with epilepsy (Neurology 1992;42:1000-1003).
Many other examples of problems are listed; however, the manufacturer
Searle says these studies raised &quot;no health problems.&quot;
<P>
<I>How was Aspartame approved as a food?</I> 
<P>
A former member of Congress was hired as President of Searle in
1977 and paid $2 million in salary and $1.5 million in bonuses
between 1979 and 1984. The Senior Assistant US attorney who was
assigned to the Searle case took no action and one year later
took a position with the law firm representing Searle.
<P>
In 1983, the Commissioner of the FDA approved NutraSweet for soft
drinks two months before leaving office. Within three months he
accepted a position as Senior Medical Advisor to Searle's public
relations firm. He was paid $1,000 per day as consultant. There
are other similar stories.
<P>
<I>Searle's contributions to medical groups</I> 
<P>
The NutraSweet company has given money to the American Diabetic
Association. And when a registered dietitian says aspartame is
safe for pregnant women, children, and everyone else, remember
that the Registered Dietitian's professional association was given
$75,000 to expound on the virtues of aspartame. The American Dietetic
Association has even stated that the NutraSweet company writes
their &quot;Fact Sheets.&quot; 
<P>
THE DEADLY DECEPTION cites chapter and verse of the coverup by
Searle and the FDA. Here are some highlights from the book THE
DEADLY DECEPTION: 
<UL>
<LI>1969 - Dr. Harry Waisman fed ASP mixed with milk to monkeys.
One died after 300 days of ASP and five others had grand mal seizures.
Searle deleted this negative study when the company submitted
safety evidence to the FDA. 
<LI>1970 - The FDA banned cyclamate during the time that the safety
of saccharin was being questioned. The time seemed ripe for ASP.

<LI>1971 - Dr. John Olney, a research psychiatrist, told Searle
that aspartic acid caused &quot;holes in the brains of mice.&quot;

<LI>1974 - Searle people said these studies raised &quot;no health
problems.&quot; Searle told the FDA about these findings after
approval was granted. 
<LI>1975 - Many of the test animals fed ASP developed large tumors.
These were NOT reported to the FDA.

to turn off the water when leaving the house. The result of a

<P>
A repairman recommended replacing the hoses as mentioned, and
even turning off the water when the machine is not in use. He
said turning the water on and off (at the wall behind the washer)
does not put stress on the hose if the washer is turned off.

<P>
<I>This information appeared in the May 22 American Statesman.</I>

<P>
Auto air bags are killing children at about one a month. A safety
campaign will soon start to prevent these tragedies. The message
is simple: requiring children to wear seat belts and sit in <U>rear</U>
seats can save their lives. (A child's body, especially the head,
cannot withstand the force of an air bag deploying at 200 mph.
Children are not small adults; their bones are still developing).
<PRE>
          ***********
</PRE>

<P>
According to the Safe Riders group of the Texas Department of
Health (800-252-8255), children under 60 pounds should be in booster
seats because safety belts do not fit correctly on them. And using
a booster chair in the front seat places the child closer to the
air bag, which is not recommended. As a rule of thumb, children
in grade school and younger shouldn't ride in the front seat because
they're too small. Also, be sure the shoulder straps are worn
correctly. Some children (and adults) put them under the arm;
in a crash the shock of the strap pressing against the ribs can
result in broken ribs and punctured lungs. Remember, safety first!
<H3><A NAME="car_seat_recalls_5_6_96">Car seat recalls announced
</A></H3>

<P>
<I>This was taken from the May 7 American Statesman</I> 
<P>
Two manufacturers of car seats, Century and Evenflo, have recalled
some of their car seats. The Century recall involves 11,000 SmartMove
Model 4750 convertible seats made between December 5, 1995 and
February 13, 1996. A mismatch of latching components could allow
the buckle to release during a crash, according to the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Call Century at 800-583-4093.
<P>
The Evenflo recall involves the Trooper Adjustable Shield child
safety seat, models 219140, 219164, 219180, 219186 and 219188
built between November 27, 1995 and January 22, 1996. Evenflo
is replacing the instruction pamphlet accompanying these seats
because it switched the instructions for infant and toddler use.

<P>
<I>This is based on an article in the May/June </I>Car &amp; Travel<I>
magazine published by the American Automobile Association</I>

<P>
You are very careful when buckling your child into his/her car
seat. But without knowing it you could be putting your child at
risk in a crash. SafetyBeltSafe USA, a group that runs drive-in
checkups and offers advice for safety use says, &quot;We see safety
conscious parents who have bought and installed a seat and come
in to have it checked. <STRONG>We find the rate of misuse to be
about 95 percent</STRONG><I>. </I>(Editor's emphasis)<I> </I>The
typical seat has 2 or 3 mistakes in installation. One or two might
be minor, the other might be serious enough to endanger the child.&quot;
<P>
<I>A simple test</I> 
<P>
There's an easy way to test the seat: give it a few good jerks.
If you tug on it and it moves forward and backward or side to
side then there's a problem. It should seem embedded in the car's
seat. If you have to put your knee in the seat to push it down
while locking the seat belt, it should be tight enough.
<P>
<I>Avoid these mistakes</I> 
<UL>
<LI><U>Never</U> install a rear facing infant seat in the front
car seat of a car with dual air bags. The deploying air bag could
snap the infant seat backwards, with potentially fatal results.
<LI><U>Never</U> put a baby under 20 pounds in a front facing
infant seat. Their necks and spinal columns aren't strong enough
to withstand the initial shock of a crash.
<LI>The back seat is <U>much</U> safer environment in a crash
for older children as well as for infants. If a child must sit
in the front seat, move it as far back as it will go.
<LI>Be sure to use the correct type of locking clip-the standard
and heavy duty locking clips look very similar but the standard
clip cannot be substituted for the heavy duty clip. The heavy
duty clip is used to shorten an Emergency Locking Retractor (ELR)
belt which many vehicles have.

<P>
There are many areas to understand to be sure that your child's
car seat is safely installed. If you have questions about your
seat or its installation, or (in Austin) want someone knowledgeable

Program, 800-252-8255.
<H3><A NAME="Ford_recall_5_6_96">Ford recall </A></H3>

<P>
<I>This information was in the American Statesman and on NPR radio</I>

<P>
Ford Motor Company has recalled many of the models made in the
years 1988-1993. A faulty ignition system can cause a fire. The
National Highway Transportation Administration is investigating
to determine if more models and in years outside 1988-93 should
also be included. Owners should be notified; however, if you bought

If you have a Ford and suspect that it may be part of the recall,
call a Ford dealer.
<H3><A NAME="witness_car_crash_5_6_96">What to do when you witness
an automobile </A>crash </H3>

<P>
<I>This is based on an article in the May/June 1996 </I>Car &amp;
Travel<I> magazine published by the AAA. It is intended as INFORMATION
ONLY,</I><U> NOT</U><I> as legal advice.</I> 
<P>
If you witness a traffic accident, what should you do? First,
be aware that different states have different &quot;good Samaritan&quot;
laws. Some states offer virtual immunity as long as the rescuer
gives aid without violating the victim's objections. Others provide
immunity as long as the rescuer is not reckless or willfully negligent,
and yet others only if he or she acts with due care at all times
and is not negligent in rendering assistance-as determined by a court.
<P>
Risk experts recommend the following do's and don'ts to help a
victim without creating additional risk:
<UL>
<LI>Don't block traffic with your vehicle. This could cause another accident.
<LI>Call for help. Note the location as precisely as possible
to speed the official response time. Also only give the facts,
avoid speculation.
<LI>Check on the victims. Apply first aid only if you're knowledgeable,
otherwise you may do more harm than good. If the situation is
not life-threatening, it is best to only offer comfort until emergency
personnel arrive.
<LI>Don't move an injured person unless they are in imminent danger
(i.e., in a fire or in traffic). The National Safety Council recommends
dragging the injured person on a blanket or coat, or lifting or
pulling from the person's shoulders or arms to minimize pressure
on the spine.
<LI>Never transport someone to the hospital on your own. You could
be liable for any further injuries or complications that occur
while they are in your care.
<LI>Obey the victim's wishes. People who have not done this have
been successfully sued by the victim.
<LI>Don't move cars, even if they are blocking traffic. Moving
them makes it harder for accident experts to reconstruct the circumstances
of the crash.
<LI>Don't play traffic cop. People are killed every year doing
this. Also, you could be held liable if your directions cause
another collision.
<LI>Don't discuss details with anyone but the police. Discussion
with other drivers may taint your testimony in the eyes of the police.
</UL>
<P>
Overall, the best guide is to do only what you feel comfortable
and qualified doing.
<P>
<I>Editor's note:</I> If you come upon an accident <U>after</U>
it has happened, some safety officials recommend that you call
for help and not stop to offer help--it could be a fake accident
staged by people intending to take advantage of others wanting to help them.

<H3><A NAME="silver_creek_speed_5_6_96"></A>Silver
Creek speed humps </H3>

<P>
Several residents are interested in adding speed humps on Silver
Creek between Oak Creek and Parmer because of the many speeding
cars on that street. They may also be added on at least the front
part of Oak Creek. Speed humps normally are 12-22 feet wide and
3-4 inches high. They are milder than speed bumps and are meant
to slow traffic, not stop it.
<P>
The city will pay from 0-100% of the cost, depending on the criteria
that are met, such as serious or continuous problems.
<P>
The city must do a study and a petition must be signed before
speed humps will be installed. We are on a wait list and it will
be awhile until we get the humps. More details are available on
one of the city of Austin's web sites, <A HREF="http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/IN/INNHUMPS.HTM">http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/IN/INNHUMPS.HTM</A>

<H3><A NAME="Easy_composting_5_6_96">Great gardens-easy composting
</A></H3>

<P>
<I>This tip was taken from the 5/5/96 Austin American Statesman
(a reader wrote to handyman Al Carrell), plus a discussion with
a master composter</I> 
<P>
An easy way to make compost is to put the grass and leaf clippings
in a plastic bag, add about 2 gallons of water and about 5 pounds
of fertilizer. Set the bag outside in the sun and pick it up and
shake it once a week. In about a month the compost is ready to
use.
<P>
Here are a few tips from a master composter:
<UL>
<LI>This is a good technique for space conservation composting.
<LI>The more &quot;brown&quot; (leaves) used, the better the compost
will be. Both the grass and fertilizer are high in nitrogen; the
brown balances that out.
<LI>Be aware that this type of composting is not organic; if you
are growing an organic garden, don't use it on the garden, just
in the flower beds.
<LI>Don't add this to newly planted plants, give them a chance
to recover from transplant shock first.
<LI>If you use only grass, there might be a bit of gas buildup
and some odor.
</UL>

<P>
If you've wanted to compost but didn't want all the fuss, this
is a good, easy way to do it, feed your flower beds-and get in
the Yard of the Month competition!

<H3>New neighborhood <A NAME="NW_Austin_Alliance_5_6_96">alliance

<P>
Northwest Austin Neighborhood Association is a new group of northwest
Austin neighborhoods that are roughly west of Mopac and north
of 2222 and within the city limits.
<P>
The basic concept is to create an alliance of neighborhoods in
Northwest Austin to try to get our fair share of city funding
to enhance the police presence in the area and the municipal services,
such as parks. There are various committees, such as zoning and
parks and some of our officers are involved in those.

*The indecent exposure in January was noted in the January newsletter.
A man was driving around and exposing himself to high school children
who were waiting for the bus.
<P>
According to the board at the Silver Creek entrance, in April
there was a break in of 2 cars on Palfrey.
<P>
An anonymous description of the incident will be included in the
police report section of the newsletter. If you see a person or
vehicle that doesn't seem to belong, get as detailed a description
as possible (especially a license number for a vehicle, if you
feel comfortable doing so) and notify the police. If it is an
emergency, call 911, otherwise you can call Officer Dale Cooper
to discuss the problem. To just file a report, call Tele-Serve
at 480-5001. We need to all watch out for our neighbors.

<H3><A NAME="Easter_egg_hunt_5_6_96">Easter Egg Hunt </A></H3>

<H3><A NAME="garage_sale_5_6_96">Smaller? successful garage sale
</A></H3>
<P>
The spring garage sale appeared to have a smaller attendance this
year, judging by the traffic in the neighborhood. This could be
because Milwood decided to also have a neighborhood garage sale
on the same weekend. We did not find out about this until the
last minute and will coordinate different days next year with
them.
<P>
Another factor in the lower turnout may have been the theft of
the 4 directional garage sale signs at the Tamarack and Silver
Creek entrances. The Oak Creek signs were not touched. This has
never happened before.

<H3>Monthly board meeting </H3>

<P>
The Northwood Neighborhood Association board meets every month,
normally on the third Wednesday at 6:30. These meetings are open
to all residents. During the summer we will meet at the Police
station on Lamplight Village Drive on the third Tuesday. During the school year we
meet at Will Davis.

</H3>

<P>
The Spring Neighborhood Garage Sale is scheduled for Saturday,
May 4th, from 8 a.m.- 4 p.m., rain or shine. Registration for
the garage sale will be from April 20 through May 3. The registration
form is in the back of this newsletter. The registration fee of
two dollars ($2.00) and the registration form in this newsletter
should be deposited in the white Association mailbox at the corner
of Oak Creek and Manhasset. The box will be checked periodically.
<P>
The garage sale will be advertised in the Austin American Statesman
and signs will be put out the day of the sale. The two dollar
fee is used to offset the cost of the ad and the cost of the signs.
<P>
If you don't have much for sale, try to get together with a neighbor
or two and combine your items. Larger amounts attract more buyers.
Baked goods, drinks, sandwiches, etc. are good for the kids to
sell.
<P>
<I>Tips for Garage Sellers:</I> 
<OL>
<LI>Cover up items not for sale.
<LI>Have change-coins and dollars. Always keep an eye on your
money. Remove large bills frequently.
<LI>For multi-family sales, have all items tagged with prices
and initials. Have a notebook with pages for each family to keep
a tally of the sales.
<LI>Know ahead of time if you or your neighbor are negotiable
on prices. For large items, record the lowest acceptable price
in the back of your notebook.
<LI>After the sale, remove your items and close the garage doors
. Also be alert while people are shopping.
<LI>If someone buys something and wants to pick it up later, get
their phone number in case they forget where you live.
</OL>

<P>
<I>Remember to register by <B>May 3</B>!</I> Check the back of
this newsletter for your registration form and deposit it with
your $2.00 in the white Association mailbox.

The Association officers were contacted by Lord of Life church 
which currently meets at Summit School. They are interested in
building a church on two of the six available lots by the dentist's
office on Parmer. They have no plans for a school, only for a
sanctuary. They may need our approval for a variance for their
steeple. The officers had some concerns about the height of the
steeple and its lighting and are talking to the church officials.
<P>
There would be no roads from the neighborhood to the church so
overflow parking should not be a concern. The general consensus
among the officers is that a church is one of the best possible
neighbors.

A non-denominational group has expressed an interest in building

caves. They said they wanted to leave most of the land in a natural
setting and so are not concerned about them.
<P>
As with the other proposed church, there would be no direct access
from Northwood to the church, so there would be no additional
traffic in the neighborhood.


<H3><A NAME="New_NW_Homes">New Northwood homes</A>? </H3>
<P>
The builder who has planned on putting two houses on the Silver
Creek lot and 3 on the Bridlewood lot has run into some unexpected
problems. At the February meeting it was reported that much of
the land is in the flood plain, which severely limits the buildable
area of the property. And further, that property is zoned as rural
residential, which only allows one house per acre (the rest of
Northwood is SF2, a higher density). To build the planned homes
would require a variance and hence approval from the immediate
neighbors, who are very concerned about the flooding impact if any homes are built.
<P>
The officers had originally agreed to the developer's plans; however,
in light of the information about flooding, they no longer support
his plans. We have not heard anything from him for some time so
we do not know his intentions.

<H3><A NAME="A_Real_Treet">A Real &quot;Treet&quot; </A></H3>
<P>
During the February general meeting, tree expert Bill Edelbrock
spoke about trees and answered numerous questions. Here is a summary of his remarks.
<P>
<I>Why should I prune my trees?</I> 
<P>
Trees are designed to grow in a forest, where there is intense
competition for sunlight-whenever a ray of light reaches the tree,
the tree grows toward it. In our yards, there is little or no
competition for sunlight but the trees don't know that. They just
grow-all over-toward the sun. In doing this, they also grow towards
the house, the street, etc. So we have to train the trees to grow
up instead of out, where they can get in the way.
<P>
<I>When is the best time to prune?</I> 
<P>
The absolute best time to prune is during the winter when the
tree is not growing. However, you can safely prune &quot;whenever
the saw is sharp.&quot;
<P>
Also, try to prune branches when they are no thicker than a man's
thumb. It's less work for you and less stressful on the tree.
<P>
<I>How should I prune?</I> 
<P>
In general, the best way is to cut the branch off right next to
the trunk, being careful to not cut into the trunk. You should
have a circular--not oval--cut when done.
<P>
If the branch is heavy, make an undercut about 1/3 of the way
through the branch and a bit away from the trunk. Then, when you
prune from the top, the limb will break at the undercut instead
of ripping off the tree. Be sure to paint oak trees <U>immediately</U>
after pruning.
<P>
If you must climb a ladder to prune a tree (not recommended; call
a professional) then be sure to tie the ladder to the tree. Otherwise
it could be hit by a falling branch and both it and you could be knocked down, 
resulting in injury.
<P>
<I>Is dehorning a tree harmful?</I> 
<P>
<U><I>NEVER</I></U> &quot;top&quot; or dehorn trees. Some &quot;experts&quot;
recommend it, but this weakens a tree. When a branch is cut off
away from the trunk it rots inward for awhile from the cut. And
smaller branches start to grow from that spot. The smaller branches--and
the rot--are weaker than the original limb. They can break much
easier in a windstorm or if covered with ice. The only exception
to this rule is crape myrtles; they don't get big enough to matter.
For them, it's personal preference.
<P>
<I>What shape tree should I buy?</I> 
<P>
For a tall tree, the best shape tree to buy is a &quot;coach whip&quot;--one
long trunk, with few or no side branches. This will grow into
a tall tree; it has not already been pruned into a shape that
will spread out. You may want to buy fruit trees that have more
branches lower so the fruit is easier to harvest.
<P>
<I>What about mistletoe?</I> 
<P>
Mistletoe is a parasite and if a tree is heavily infected, mistletoe
may kill a tree. Simply cutting mistletoe off a branch is not
sufficient to stop it; its roots go into the branch. The best
way to remove mistletoe is to prune the branch off at the trunk.
<P>
Bill is also part of TreeFolks, a nonprofit group dedicated to
planting trees and educating people about trees. If you would
like to learn more about trees or would like to help them, call
512-443-LEAF.

<P>
During January, KVUE 24 News &quot;Only at Ten&quot; featured
a disturbing story on iced tea. The reporter made some sun tea
and also bought iced tea from 7 Austin restaurants, ranging from
fast food to fancy and had the eight samples of tea analyzed by
a lab. <U><I>All</I></U> of the restaurant tea contained fecal
coliform and ecoli bacteria, which causes digestive illnesses.
The sun tea had no bacteria.
<P>
Because of the results, they thought there had been some cross
contamination. They redid the experiment, this time sampling tea
from 25 area restaurants. This time, 23 of the 25 teas contained
fecal coliform and ecoli. While this may be a concern for everyone, 
the very young and the very old are most at risk when drinking contaminated tea.
<P>
Possible reasons for the bacteria:
<UL>
<LI>The tea was brewed at too low a temperature-it should be at
least 180 degrees.
<LI>The tea was more than 8 hours old.
<LI>The container was not covered; something could have fallen
in the tea and contaminated it.
<LI>The spout through which the tea was poured was not properly
cleaned, which is difficult to do.
</UL>

<P>
The reporter said the restaurant association is trying to design
a spout that is easier to clean. Meanwhile, a few restaurants
are serving only bottled tea instead of brewed tea. Consider either
asking if the restaurant serves bottled tea or just order water
instead. <BR>

<P>
A vehicle is stolen every 20 seconds in the United States. No
vehicle or anti-theft device is 100% theft proof, however there
are some things you can follow to lower the chances of being a
victim of car theft. This list was provided by the Police Department.
<P>
<I>No cost precautions:</I> 
<UL>
<LI>Take your keys and lock your car.
<LI>Never hide a second set of keys in your car-thieves will look
for them.
<LI>Park in well lighted areas and, if possible, in attended parking
lots.
<LI>If you park in an attended lot and left the key, check the
tires, spare and battery to be sure they were not changed.
<LI>Never leave your car running even if you're only gone for
a minute-this includes on cold mornings.
<LI>Park with wheels turned toward the curb; this makes it harder
to tow.
<LI>Always use the emergency brake when parking; it makes the
car harder to tow.
<LI>Don't leave the registration or title in the car; this makes
it easier for a thief to sell.
<LI>Drop business cards, address labels or other IDs inside the
vehicle door. By marking your vehicle like this you help the police
identify your car-thieves frequently alter the vehicle ID number
(VIN).
</UL>

<P>
<I>&quot;Hot&quot; Used car deals</I> 
<P>
Not all cars are stripped for parts. Many are resold to unknowing
buyers. If you knowingly buy a stolen car, you can be arrested.
If you buy a stolen car without knowing it, you could lose the
car and your money.
<P>
These tips help avoid this:
<UL>
<LI>Beware of any deal that seems &quot;too good to be true.&quot;
<LI>When buying from an individual, be sure the title and registration
match the ID of the person selling the car.
<LI>Verify the VIN has not been repainted.
</UL>

<P>
If you normally do not drive between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m., consider
signing up for the HEAT (Help End Auto Theft) program. It costs
$2 for a four-year period. Vehicle owners not normally using their
vehicle during these hours sign an agreement allowing peace officers
to verify ownership if they see the vehicle being driven during
these hours.
<P>
The HEAT program allows officers throughout the state to have
immediate access to the data on the car. Even if the thief removed
the HEAT decal, the officer will know it has been registered.
<P>
For further information about HEAT, contact the Austin Police
or 800-CAR-WATCH.

Any time you see a person or vehicle that doesn't seem to belong,
get as detailed a description as possible and notify the police
of a suspicious person, vehicle or graffiti or other indications
of a gang. We need to all watch out for our neighbors. <BR>

<P>
An article in the <I>American Statesman </I> last year tests how
prepared you are to face any of a number of common home emergencies.
Read the situations below and decide what you would do. Then read
the answers below. Give this some thought--any of these could
happen to you, and some of them require quick action.
<OL>
<LI>Your child falls and knocks out a permanent tooth. What should
you do before leaving for the dentist's office?
<LI>Your neighbor collapses while mowing the lawn on a hot day.
What should you do?
<LI>You are awakened by the sound of breaking glass. What should
you do?
<LI>You discover a tick embedded in your skin. What should you
do?
<LI>Your child steps on a nail while playing outside. What should
you do?
<LI>In the middle of the night, a friend who has been depressed
calls you and threatens suicide, but when you try to phone an
ambulance, he recants and says he is fine. What should you do?
<LI>You think your child might have swallowed several adult aspirin.
What should you do?
<LI>It is just after dark on a weeknight and you are home alone.
Someone rings the doorbell, but when you look out the peephole
you realize the porch light has burned out and you can't see who
it is. What should you do?
<LI>Your child wakes with a fever of 101 degrees but no other
symptoms. What should you do?
<LI>Your aunt is stung by a bee and begins to feel faint. What
should you do?
</OL>
<P>
<P>
<I>Answers</I>
<OL>
<LI>Ideally, put the tooth back in its own socket and have the
child bite down on gauze or tissue to hold it in place. If this
isn't possible, put the tooth in milk until you see the dentist--the
minerals and proteins will help preserve the tissue that attaches
the tooth to the gums.
<LI>The goal is to lower the internal temperature by lowering
the surface body temperature. If his entire body is not cooled
off right away, heat exhaustion or heat stroke might occur. The
next step is to move him inside in front of a fan or air conditioner
and get him water. If he is not responsive after being moved to
a cooler place, call 911.
<LI>Turn on the light and the television and lock the bedroom
door if you can. If you have children, bring them to your room
after you've called 911 and made enough noise to let a potential
burglar know that someone is home.
<LI>If you are unsure whether or not you removed the entire tick,
or if you experience joint pain, fatigue or a low-grade fever
a week after removing the tick, check with your doctor.
<LI>Never remove an embedded object unless it clearly penetrates
just below the skin surface. Because it is often difficult to
tell the depth of penetration, you should always consult a physician.
<LI>Never hang up and just assume that the person isn't going
to follow through. If you are really uncertain about how serious
your friend is, call 911, then go to his/her house. There is a
specially trained unit with the sheriff's department that will
take the person to a mental health facility if needed.
<LI>Always call Poison Control, (409) 765-1420 or a hospital whenever
you suspect poisoning. Never use syrup of ipecac without first
consulting a health worker.
<LI>Never open the door for anyone you don't know. Make it clear
that you are home, so that potential burglars won't try to break
in.
<LI>Although fever with no other symptoms is usually no cause
for alarm, it should disappear with the use of acetaminophen (children's
Tylenol). If it does not, there might be a more serious underlying
cause that needs to be evaluated by a physician. A cold bath can
cause a cycle of chills and fever that will only exacerbate the
problem.
<LI>Whenever symptoms occur other than swelling and minor pain,
an allergy might be involved. If the affected person gets hives
or has a shortness of breath, she should be taken to the hospital
immediately. If the only symptoms are swelling and pain, taking
a pain reliever and putting ice or meat tenderizer on the area
should be enough.
</OL>

<H3><A NAME="Safety_Tips595"></A><A NAME="Food_Poisoning595">Food
Poisoning--No Picnic </A>(May/June 1995)</H3>

<P>
<I>This information is from the Wall Street Journal</I>
<P>
The range of food-born illnesses is increasing beyond the traditional
warm potato salad or chicken. Each year tainted meat, poultry,
eggs and product cause <I>7</I> <I>million</I> people to become
ill and 7,000 to die.
<P>
Produce is an increasing culprit, with up to 70% of winter fruits
and vegetables imported from developing countries. In those countries
people boil or peel fruits we normally do not even wash, such
as pineapples or melons--their rinds may be contaminated. And
their bacteria can be passed elsewhere with incautious handling.
<P>
<I>Culprits and results</I>
<P>
There are a variety of bacteria --E. Coli, listeria, salmonella
and others--that cause the problems; serious results include meningitis,
miscarriage or death. Call the doctor if you have symptoms that
last more than 24 hours, if dehydration sets in, if fever and
stiff neck suggest meningitis or if bloody diarrhea suggest E.
Coli is present. 
<P>
<I>Prevention</I>
<P>
At home, wash produce thoroughly. Cook meat well, until beef is
brown (including the juice) and poultry juices run clear. Clean
raw meat juices from counters and utensils. Avoid raw shellfish--a
source of hepatitis. Avoid raw eggs and raw or unpasturized milk.
Defrost meat in the refrigerator or microwave, not on the counter.
Sterilize cutting boards. Be choosy about deli foods and where
you buy meat. Toss leftovers after 3 days. At the least these
precautions can help prevent a lot of discomfort and they may
even save your life.

<H2>Children's Safety</H2>

<H3><A NAME="Prevent_Fatal_Falls795">Preventing Fatal Falls </A>(July/Aug
1995)</H3>

<P>
Small children don't realize how dangerous it can be to lean on
windows, especially windows above the first floor. Singer Eric
Clapton's 4-year old son fell through their 15th-floor apartment
window to his death.
<P>
If you have small children and a two-story home, consider some
sort of barrier for those windows. Possibilities are inside burglar
bars or even several clothes rods installed several inches apart
(both are available at Builder's Square and other hardware stores).
The idea is to use something that will handle a child's weight
and prevent them from falling through the window when they lean
on it.

<H3><A NAME="Loaner_Car_Seats795"></A><A NAME="Bunk_Bed_Safety1195"></A><A NAME="Bike_Safety595">Bicycle
Safety </A>(May/June 1995)</H3>

<P>
Most parents and older children are aware of the importance of
wearing helmets when riding bikes. They can prevent serious head
injuries. However, one other area is often overlooked, especially
for younger children: the chain. Be sure your young children know
to keep their hands away from the chain. At least one child lost
the tip of his finger when it became caught in the chain. His
parents rushed him to the hospital and fortunately they were able
to reattach it. But a bit of foresight could have prevented the
accident. 

<H3>Bunk Bed safety tips (Nov/Dec 1995)</H3>
<I>These tips are from a 1995 </I>Parents<I> magazine</I> 
<P>
Bunk beds can be safe when a few common sense precautions are
followed.
<UL>
<LI>Be sure there are railings on both sides of the top bunk,
even if the bed is next to the wall. A child (especially a small
one) can easily fall between the bed and wall.
<LI>Make certain the correct size mattress is used-a regular mattress
in an extra long frame creates gaps a child can fall through.
<LI>Be sure that the top and bottom bedposts fasten together or
must be lifted at least 1&#188; inches to separate them.
<LI>Check the ladder to be sure it is securely anchored to the
bed frame.
</UL>

<P>
Don't allow children under age 6 or more than one child at a time
on the top bunk.
<H3><A NAME="Bunk_Bed_Recall1195">Bunk bed recall </A>(Nov/Dec
1995)</H3>

<P>
<I>This information is from a 1995 </I>Parents<I> magazine</I>
<P>
From 1990 to 1994, 24 children, most of them age 3 or under, died
in bunk-bed related accidents. To protect children (and adults),
the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) recently recalled
320,000 wooden bunk beds. In addition, a manufacturer is recalling
about 8,000 metal bunk beds. 
<P>
To find out if your bunk bed is part of the recall, get the make
and model number and, if possible, when it was purchased and call
the CPSC at 800-638-2772. They also have information about recalls
of other products.
<H3>Loaner Car Seats Available (July/Aug 1995)</H3>

<P>
<I>This information is from the Austin American Statesman</I>

<P>
Currently <U>all</U> children under age 2 in Texas are required
to be in a federally approved car seat while traveling. Children
between 2 and 4 are required to be restrained with a seat belt
or to be buckled into a child safety seat while traveling.
<P>
However, out of state visitors sometimes do not bring their car
seats with them. Fortunately, there is a loaner program available.
Call 800-252-8255 (the Department of Health's Safe Rider program)
to find out if the airport has a program known as Airport Assistance
that will loan them a safety seat. There is a $5-$10 deposit that
is refunded when the seat is returned.
<P>
If a specific airport, such as Austin's Robert Mueller Airport,
does not have an Airport Assistance program, the Safe Riders staff
at the 800 number will help you locate a loaner seat through another
loaner program.
<P>
<A HREF="#Archive_Top">Return to top</A>

<H3><A NAME="Traveling_Children_Hotline795">Keep All Traveling
Children Safe </A>(July/Aug 1995)</H3>

<P>
Have you ever seen small children in a car that are not restrained?
If so, get the license number and call 800-559-2358. The Safe
Kids program at Brackenridge Hospital will send the vehicle's
owner a copy of the state law, information on keeping children
safe and a number they can call to rent a car seat. 

<H3><A NAME="Police_Tips">Police Tips on Personal Safety (May/June 1995)</A></H3>

<P>
During a meeting with the neighborhood, police officers gave us
many helpful safety tips. They included:
<UL>
<LI>Know the address of the house behind you. Many burglars break
in the back; being able to give the 911 operator the exact address
can make a difference.
<LI>Write down descriptions of suspicious people or vehicles.
Do not rely on your memory.
<LI>For vehicles, obtain a complete license number. Identifying
a vehicle based on a partial number is time consuming and hence
usually not done for burglaries.
<LI>Many patio doors can simply be lifted out (they were installed
backwards). Install a lock to pin down the door.
<LI>Do not stop the paper when going on vacation--people who deliver
the paper are not paid that highly, plus they may have unethical
friends. Have a neighbor pick up your paper.
<LI>Disable the garage door opener while on vacation.
<LI>Close the garage door when you are not out front.
<LI>Do not let workers (roofers, painters, etc.) in your house
to go to the bathroom. They can see everything you have.
<LI>Be sure your house numbers are easily visible for both the
police and EMS.
<LI>Never tell salespeople your name, your neighbor's name or
any other information. Burglars can dress nicely and pose as salespeople
while picking their targets.
<LI>Change your security codes periodically, (or at least clean
the keypad) so a burglar cannot identify which numbers you press.
<LI>Alarms with the loudest sirens are best. 
<LI>Be sure your house numbers are clearly visible from the street.
<LI>Get a Vial of Life with your medical information (allergies,
etc.) and keep it in your refrigerator. This is a great help to
EMS if they answer an emergency call. Check with your pharmacy
for the vial of life.
</UL>

<H3>Special Donations (Sept/Oct. 1995)</H3>
<I>This information is from Jane Grieg's column in the American
Statesman</I> 
<P>
There are a few groups in town that accept donations of specific
items. These include:
<P>
<I>Books</I>-all books, especially children's books, cookbooks,
literature and reference books such as encyclopedias are wanted
by the Friends of the Austin Public Library for their annual book
sale Oct. 5-7, at the lower level of Palmer Auditorium. Donations
may be left at all branch libraries in the &quot;Friends Booksale&quot;
boxes. The sale benefits the library system's programs and equipment
that are not funded through the regular city budget. Contributions
are tax deductible. For a donation receipt or more information,
call 459-7104.
<P>
<I>Eyeglasses</I>-Prevent Blindness Texas (5555 N. Lamar), Telephone
Pioneers (1616 Guadalupe St.) and Dr. Robert Rock (5011 Burnet
Rd) collect eyeglasses. Lions Clubs also collect and distribute
them to needy individuals in South America. There are collection
boxes at the Chimney Corners post office and the Lions Eye Bank
at Seton Hospital-they also accept used hearing aids. Finally,
Lenscrafters Foundation accepts glasses at the Lenscrafters stores,
repairs them and send them to countries in need.
<P>
<I>Cars, trucks, boats, RVs, motorcycles</I>-Prevent Blindness
Texas, 4598936, collects them to benefit sight saving programs
in Central Texas. Vehicles are towed at no cost to the owner and
auctioned. The National Kidney Foundation (2884984) has a car
recycling campaign to raise funds to help fight kidney and urinary
tract diseases. And finally, the American Lung Association (343-0502
or 800 USA LUNG) also accepts vehicles. The vehicles do not need
to be running. Donations to the first two groups are tax exempt
and the Lung Assoc. may be also (her article did not mention it).

<P>
<H2>The Open Door Program</H2>
</P>

<HR>

<P>
Our program is formulated to meet the unique needs of each child to develop a healthy self-esteem and to improve needed skills.  The curriculum is designed to enrich the horizons and coping skills of the children.  In addition to free play which helps develop spontaneity, creativity and the ability to make choices, the children are encouraged in developing self-help skills and social responsibility for their classmates.
</P>


<IMG SRC="draw.gif" ALT="Draw.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=135 HEIGHT=111 HSPACE=4 BORDER=2>

<P>
During the day the children have the opportunity for creative activities such as art and creative movement, fine motor activities which help the children learn the skills necessary to eventually learn to write, language development activities, discovery activities which help teach about nature and the world around us, gross motor activities to develop healthy bodies, building with many types of blocks and other manipulative toys to help develop beginning math concepts, and cognitive activities to help develop age-appropriate concept development.
</P>

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.america-tomorrow.com/naeyc/accredit.htm"><IMG SRC="naecp.gif" ALT="NAECP" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=130 HEIGHT=101></A>

All three Open Door schools are accredited by the National Academy of Early Childhood Programs.  Accreditation is a lengthy process undertaken every three years.  It involves staff self-evaluations, staff and parent evaluations of the program as a whole, and an outside validator who confirms our self-evaluations.  These national standards of quality help ensure that the children are being cared for in developmentally appropriate ways.
</P>

<P>
The Open Door believes that children's natural curiosity and playfulness should be encouraged while helping the children learn to be responsible members of society.  We want the children to have fun while at the Open Door.  Positive guidance techniques are used to help the children interact appropriately with each other.  These methods further the children's feelings of success and thus enhance their self-esteem.

<h2>The History of the Open Door</h2>

<HR>

<P>
The Open Door was started in 1975 when a family searched in vain to locate a child care program which would accept both of their children: a normally developing preschooler and a toddler with Down's syndrome.  From that frustrating search an idea was born - to offer a program which integrates developmentally challenged children into a quality child care setting.
</P>

<IMG SRC="play2.gif" ALT="Play2.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=155 HEIGHT=172 HSPACE=4 BORDER=2>

<P>
Money was raised through donations and fundraising activities, volunteers were recruited, and the Open Door began accepting children in the fall of 1975.  The school attracted the support of the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health which assisted with funding for the school's first two years of operation.  The Trull Foundation, the Lack Foundation, the Cameron Foundation, and the Lola Wright Foundation have assisted the Open Door through the years.  The City of Austin, Travis County and the United Way now fund the provision of sliding scale tuition to low-income students, and the city and county fund the extra teachers, the education director and the social worker needed to ensure that the needs of the developmentally changed students are fully met.  The majority of the program is funded by parent tuition and fees.
</P>

<A HREF ="http://www.unitedway.org/"><IMG SRC="uway2.gif" ALT="United Way Home Page" WIDTH=135 HEIGHT=138 ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=4 VSPACE=4></A>

<P>
From its first class of nine children, the Open door has grown to include two preschools each serving 34 children ages 2 through 5 years.  Approximately 80 children are enrolled at the two preschools with about 25% considered to be developmentally challenged.  In 1986 the Open Door was invited to be a founding member of the Austin Groups for the Elderly (AGE), and that fall an infant/toddler center opened to serve 30 children ages 2 months through 2 years.  Through joint programming with the adult day care facility which is also a member of AGE, the Open Door lntergenerational Program has allowed the Open Door to extend its mission to serve two new age groups - the elderly as well as the very young.

<H2>Meals and Nutrition</H2>

<HR>

<P>
Parents of children at the infant/toddler center must provide all of the food their child requires for the day. Children at the two preschools receive a school provided snack each morning and afternoon, the parents are required to send a lunch every day.
</P>

<P>
The Open Door has a very strict nutritious food only policy. Children learn the best if their nutritional needs are being met. We do not allow foods which only provide "empty' calories such as treats, candy, cookies, gum, and most types of chips or drinks which contain sugar. The reason for our policy is to avoid tempting children to fill up on empty calories thereby depriving themselves of the healthy food needed to develop strong bodies and minds. If any of these types of foods are sent to school, the staff will not serve them to your child.
</P>

<P>
If you are uncertain what kinds of food are appropriate, please talk to your child's teacher or the site director. We want to work with you to ensure that your child is getting the protein, vitamins, minerals and carbohydrates s/he needs to remain healthy. The Department of Human Services requires that a child in care for more than 6 hours be provided with at least 1/2 of their daily food requirements. They also require that your child receive a daily serving of a Vitamin C rich food, such as orange juice, cantaloupe, melon, broccoli, tomatoes, strawberries, citrus fruit, baked potato, cauliflower, cabbage or greens. Each child needs from 1/4 to 1/3 cup of one of these foods each day.
</P>

<P>
Please remember that the teachers are helping many children eat their meals.  Foods should be sent as ready to eat as possible (i.e. already peeled cut into bite-sized pieces if necessary).  Microwaves are available to warm food, but again remember that the teachers do not have the time to heat every child's lunch every day. Please talk with your child's teacher about foods that need refrigeration - each center has a different storage capacity.
</P>

<P>
Please remember to label everything.  Please use plastic containers to avoid the danger of broken bottles.  The teachers try their best to return everyone's containers, but please understand that our first priority is to care for the children, and getting each container back to its proper lunch box is a secondary concern.
</P>

<P>
We encourage breast feeding mothers to come feed their babies at school as much as they are able.  If you need to breast feed at the end of the day try to arrive early enough so that you and your child will be able to leave by 5:30.
</P>

<BODY BGCOLOR=WHITE>

<H2>School Calendar and Hours</H2>

<HR>

<P>
Each center is open from 7:30am until 5:30pm.  It is important that the children arrive by 9:00am so that they may participate in the morning program as well as any morning field trips.
</P>

<P>
Half-day care is available on a limited basis.  Half-day programs are either 7:30am until 12:30pm or 12:30pm until 5:30pm.  The Open Door has many children who attend an early childhood program in the morning, and we are very happy to work with the staff of other programs to ensure that the children receive care consistent with their needs.
</P>
<BR>
<P>
<H3>School Pick-up</H3>
Children will be released only to their parent or others who are specifically designated in the Child Care Contract.  Parents should notify the staff whenever someone other than a parent will be picking up the child.  The staff will check the photo ID of anyone unknown to them who is picking up a child even though the parent has given their permission:  this policy is designed to protect the children.

<P>
If you have an emergency which will delay your arrival in picking up your child, please call the center.  Staff members who remain to care for a child after 5:30 should be paid immediately for that care.  The late fee is $1.00 for each minute after closing time that the parent arrives.

<H3>Closings due to weather</H3>
The school may also be closed on other days due to inclement weather.  Whenever the public schools are closed due to weather conditions, the Open Door is also closed.  Public schools make their announcements on the TV and radio by 7:00am.  The Open Door will not be specifically announced, but whenever the Austin public schools close due to weather parents should keep their children home also.

<H2>Field Trips, Toys, Clothing and Other Supplies</H2>

<P>
<HR></P>

<H3>Field Trips</H3>

<P>Field trips are a fun part of the Open Door program. Notices about field
trips will always be posted at least 48 hours in advance of the trip. Parents
are required to sign a permission form so that their child will be able
to go on the field trip. Please talk to your child's teacher about field
trip schedules and where to look for the permission form. </P>


<P>The school has a 15-passenger van which is used for most field trips. Occasionally
several classes want to take a trip on the same day and we ask for parent
volunteers to drive their cars for the field trip. All children will be
strapped into a seat belt during field trips whether they are in the school
van or a private car. </P>

<P>Because the field trips are generally very exciting for the children,
they are a wonderful topic of discussion for you and your child. Children
often have trouble discussing what has happened during a routine day, so
field trips offer the opportunity to really engage your child in an interesting
conversation. </P>

<P><BR>
</P>

<H3>Toys</H3>

<IMG SRC="chimes.gif" ALT="chimes.gif" HSPACE=4 BORDER=2 HEIGHT=133 WIDTH=150 ALIGN=RIGHT><P>The schools have many developmentally appropriate toys t the children's
use during the school day. Some children enjoy bringing toys from home.
Children are encouraged to bring toys or other objects from home on &quot;Show
and Tell&quot; day. While we do not encourage toys on other days, we realize they
are one way in which children ease their transition fro home to school.
The teachers try to help the children develop a sense of responsibility
about their belongings, but home toys are the child's responsibility at
school and they may b lost or damaged. Parents should not allow items to
come to school that are irreplaceable. </P>

<P>We are always glad for the children to share book records, tapes, or
items from nature (bird nests, rocks, fossils, etc.). We do not allow war
toys or toys whose main theme Is violence. </P>

<P><BR>
</P>

<H3>Clothing and other supplies</H3>

<P>Children should be dressed in play clothes which are appropriate for
the season and the weather conditions. Please keep in mind that your child
may be involved in very messy activities at school. The teachers try to
take precautions to protect children's clothing, but our first concern
is that the children enjoy their activity, not that they keep their clothing
clean. Special clothing which the parents want to remain in good condition
is not really appropriate to wear to school. </P>

<P>All children should have at least one extra change of clothes which
is appropriate for the season at school at all times. It is important that
the parent bring enough extra clothes to last the entire day - for some
children one change will last a whole season, for others this may mean
4-5 changes each day. Please evaluate your child's needs realistically
and furnish him/her with enough clothing. All clothing should be labeled
with the child's name to help avoid loss and confusion. </P>

<P>The Open Door accepts both disposable and cloth diapers. Parents who
use cloth diapers need to bring plastic bags for the soiled diapers. The
infant/toddler center also has a private cloth diaper service available
for diapers needed during school hours. The director can help parents get
in touch with the company to find out about fees and procedures. </P>

<P>Parents provide crib sheets and blankets for the children in the infant
room. It is the parents' responsibility to make up the child's crib each
Monday and launder the bedding at the end of the week. Older children are
welcome to bring blankets, small pillow or stuffed toys to sleep with during
naps.</P>

<HEAD><TITLE>Open Door Preschool, Austin, Texas: Medications & Illness Policy</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR=WHITE>

<H2>Medications and Illness Policy</H2>

<HR>

<P>
Signed permissions slips are required for all children needing medication while at the center.  Exact instructions about dosage, time, days the medicine is needed and conditions for giving the medication must be noted on the chart.  All medication must be in the original container.  If it is prescription medicine, the name on the prescription must be that of the child.
</P>

<P>
The staff make every effort to give medication as scheduled, but occasionally we forget a dose.  Please try to remember that the teachers are caring for many children and do a wonderful job of meeting as many individual needs as possible.
</P>

<P>
The Open Door does not have the facilities to care for sick children.  Children should not be brought to school when they are too ill or uncomfortable to participate in the normal daily activities including outdoor play.  Children who get sick at school must be picked up from school as quickly as possible to help avoid exposing other children.
</P>
<BR>
<P>
<H3>Illness Guidelines</H3>
The Open Door guidelines concerning when children are too ill to be at school are:

<ul>
     <li>unexplained diarrhea
     <li>vomiting
     <li>unexplained rashes
     <li>general inability to participate in school activities
     <li>discharge from or crusting of the eyes
     <li>greenish discharge from the nose
     <li>excessive coughing
</ul>
</P>

<P>
If your child has a contagious disease, please call the school so that we can inform the other parents.  The staff appreciate your calling to explain any absence - we miss your children when they are absent and are concerned if we do not know why.  Children must be fever-free for 24 hours before they can return to school.  The only exception is when an ear infection has been diagnosed and the child has been on antibiotics for at least 24 hours.
</P>

<P>
The guidelines listed above will be used to evaluate your child at school.  When a staff member calls to say your child must be picked up, please do so as quickly as possible.  If you have questions concerning the legitimacy of the call please direct them to the director at another time.  Sometimes staff will call a parent to alert them that their child is not feeling well even though the parent is not required to pick the child up.  Some parents choose to pick their child up at these times while other appreciate being alerted that a visit to the doctor might be needed.  We try to work with you as a team to ensure that your child remains healthy.
</P>

<B>Allergies:</B>  Parents should provide the school with a list of all known allergies.  Please talk with your child's teacher about symptoms and any signs which s/he should be alert for.

<P>
<B>Emergencies:</B>  In the case of a critical illness or injury, your physician will be contacted for instructions and you will be contacted as quickly as possible.  If your or your physician cannot be contacted, the child will be taken to the Emergency Room at Brackenridge Hospital.  EMS will be contacted when appropriate.
</P>

<P>
The Open Door carries accident insurance to cover the medical costs associated with your child's injury.
</P>
<BR>
<P>
<H3>Vision and Hearing Screening</H3>
All 4 year olds are required to have vision and hearing screening.  The Open Door provides this screening free each fall.  Children who do not participate in the free screening must provide written records of vision and hearing screening from a doctor or clinic.
</P>

<BODY BGCOLOR=WHITE>


<H2>Parent-Teacher Communication</H2>

<HR>

<P>
<H3>Daily</H3>
Each school has a parent bulletin board for important program information.  Each child has a personal cubby and/or file folder which may also contain newsletters, notes or notices.  Parents are encouraged to check each of these places daily so that you will know about plans and changes.
</P>
<BR>
<P>
<H3>Parent Meetings</H3>
The two preschools have several parent meetings and/or events each year.  Some of the events (such as the Halloween party) are designed specifically for the children while others are more social in nature (e.g., pot luck suppers).  These provide the opportunity for the parents and staff to get to know one another and for the parents of children in the same class to meet one another.  It is important for parents to participate in these events as much as possible because it helps the child realize that the parents value the school and what their child does there.  Children need to know that their lives and what they do are important to their parents.
</P>
<BR>
<P>
<H3>Staff Meetings</H3>
An important aspect of the Open Door program is the weekly staff meetings.  These meetings provide staff with the time to discuss problems with the program, to exchange information about the children and to receive specialized training.  The meetings are held at noon once each week.  Parents of children at the Open Door are expected during these meetings.  For some groups of children, the parents may be asked to come several times in one semester.  A staff member is also providing supervision during these meetings to ensure that emergencies can be handled appropriately.
</P>
<BR>
<P>
<H3>Conferences</H3>
We believe that there should be ample opportunities for parents to talk to staff about your child.  We welcome your visits and your comments.  However, it is advisable to have extended and/or serious discussions concerning your child without the child present.  We schedule conferences either at the parent's request or teacher's, and we expect parents to attend one parent conference near the end of each semester.

<HEAD><TITLE>Open Door Preschool, Austin, Texas: Program Structure and Parent Involvement</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR=WHITE>

<H2>Program Structure and Parent Involvement</H2>

<HR>

<P>
The Open Door is operated by Project Normalization which is a nonprofit corporation governed by a volunteer board of directors.  The board meets 11 times annually and includes parents, staff and interested community members.  The board of directors is a policy-making body which is also responsible for the school's financial management.
</P>

<P>
The organization is headed by the Administrative Director and the Educational Director.  The two directors as well as the other members of the administrative team (the site director from each center and the social worker) work together to ensure that the program functions smoothly on a day-to-day basis.
</P>

<P>
The City of Austin, Travis County and the United Way provided assistance as do private foundations and individual contributors.  Parents help with several fund raising events each year.  However, the organization is funded primarily by parent tuition.  These tuition payments are used to pay staff salaries and benefits, rent, insurance, utilities and to purchase supplies.
</P>
<BR>
<P>
<H3>Voluntary Efforts</H3>
The cost of providing care exceeds the amount parents are charged in tuition.  One way we are able to keep tuition down is by involving the parents in helping with the upkeep of the school.  Donations of supplies (crayons, washable markers, stickers, glue, surplus paper, computer paper, baby wipes, Kleenex, paper towels, juice, crackers, etc.) are always appreciated.  Some parents choose to make a monthly donation to the supply fund for the purchase of new toys and equipment.  All of these donations help the school continue to provide the highest quality of care at the most reasonable price possible.
</P>

<P>
Parents also help on work days which are scheduled once or twice each year.  These days are usually devoted to major maintenance tasks such as painting, repairing toys and shelves, repairing playground equipment, spreading sand, and major cleaning projects.  Not only do these days help keep the schools in the best shape possible, but they help the children realize that their school is important to their parents as well as to their teachers.
</P>

<P>
The Board of Directors always has at least one parent representative from each school.  We welcome the participation of interested parents.  The board and the Administrative Director participate in many fund raising activities throughout the year, but their efforts need to be supplemented by the parents at times.  The school usually sponsors a fall wreath sale and a spring fund-raiser.  The parents are essential partners in each of these events.  We hope that all parents will be able to participate either by donating time or money.  (All donations are tax-deductible.)

<H2>Parent Concerns and Current Staff</H2>

<HR>

<P>
<H3>Concerns</H3>
If you have questions or concerns about the program please be sure to talk with your child's teacher.  If you need more information, the director is available to meet with you to discuss your concerns.  Because our directors also teach, it is best to schedule these meetings for the afternoon.  Some policies or questions may need to be directed to the Administrative Director of the Education Director.  Please feel free to call on them whenever you have a concern which the teacher or site director is unable to fully answer.  The Board of Directors is also available for hearing concerns.  The Secretary of the board has been designated as the contact for parents with problems or concerns.
</P>
<BR>
<P>
<H3>Social Worker</H3>
The Open Door has a half-time social worker, devoted to serving the needs of all the families at the Open Door.  The Social Worker will meet with each family when they first enroll.  Parents can contact the Social Worker at any time with their concerns.  The Social Worker can provide parents with information and referrals, short-term crisis counseling, family support, and emergency food and clothing.  The Social Worker is available to all families, irregardless of their income level.

<P>The Rotary Club of East Austin meets at noon on Tuesdays at the Conley Guerrero Senior Center, 808 Nile Street in East Austin.
</P>

<HR>

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">October Calendar</H4>

<P>October 8 Board meeting, 5:30 p.m., Lone Star Girl Scouts Council office</P>

<HR>

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">From the President</H4>

<P>New President-elect:  As you are aware, President-elect James Carter and his wife Gwen have decided to live part time in Cloudcroft, New Mexico,  Since he would be missing several weekly meetings in a row, he decided to resign his office.  We were very sorry to lose James, but we are grateful that he will still be with us on a somewhat regular basis.  Our club then nominated and elected &quot;Tink&quot; Hill as President-elect.  Congratulations to Tink!  We have had him working hard as International Chair, and he asked for a brief period to wrap up his duties and pass them on to his replacement before taking on the President-elect duties.</P>

<P>
Scholars:  At our club meetings, we have met the three Rotary Ambassadorial Scholarship applicants which our club submitted to the District competition (for a total of 7 academic and 2 cultural scholarships).  I am extremely pleased to report that all three were selected as recipients or alternates.  Michael Puri
received an academic scholarship, Holly Ogren was selected as First Alternate for the scholarships, and Avital Harari received a three-month cultural scholarship to study Spanish in Spain.  Congratulations!  This was our first effort, and though it will be hard to keep to the standard we have set, let's start planning now for next year.</P>

<P>CHARITech:  We were selected to have a booth at the third annual CHARITech.  Clyde, Margarine, and Nora designed the booth and it looked great.  Look for pictures soon!  Fifteen hundred attendees were expected, and we think they all came by our booth!  Clyde and Nora worked the crowd hard and we reaped benefits immediately:  David Buttress attended Rotary on Tuesday, September 24, as a result of meeting us at CHARITech (coincidentally, he is Pam Johnson's neighbor). All booth exhibitors were entered in a drawing for three major prizes.  The Black Engineers (represented at CHARITech by former club member
Greg Madry) won first prize, which was two round-trip tickets anywhere in the world, and East Austin Rotary won third prize -- three computers.  The Board will need to decide what we are to do with the sudden wealth!</P>

<P>Poster project:  We sent Fidencio Dur&aacute;n off to Paris with $2000 and will send him the remainder as soon as we are able to collect it.  We have certainly gotten a lot of exposure from this project.  We were allowed to offer the poster at Parque Zaragosa, Central Market, Austin Museum of Art, El Sol y La Luna restaurant, Mexico Tipico restaurant, MED Week, Park Place Gallery, the Hispanic Heritage Month celebrations of the Hispanic Bar Association and Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the General Land Office, ACC-Northridge campus, the City of Austin, Mexican consulate, and Mexic-Arte Museum.  The posters are still available at Mexic-Arte and the Austin Museum of Art Satellite Shop.  We also received wonderful publicity from the Austin American-Statesman and the Chronicle.  Thanks to everyone for their support.  However, we are still working on getting the poster into social studies, bilingual, and Spanish language classes.  Checks for the poster ($15 unsigned, $25 signed, $55 signed and framed) can be made to the East Austin Rotary Club.</P>

<P>Foundation Banquet:  One of the goals of District 5870 was to hold an annual Foundation Banquet as a district-wide fundraiser.  The event, &quot;A Night for Heroes,&quot; will be held on Saturday, November 9, at 7:00 p.m. at the Frank Mayborn Center in Temple.  The guest speaker will be Apollo 13 commander James A. Lovell.  The event will honor all District 5870 Rotarian &quot;heroes&quot; who have supported or will support the Foundation.Rotarian tickets to the banquet are $100 per person, but 100% of that amount will be recorded as a contribution to the Rotary Foundation in the Rotarian's name.  Each $100 ticket entitles a Rotarian to purchase a spouse/guest ticket for $40 (no Foundation contribution).  Each $100 ticket purchased will be recorded as a 100% contribution from whomever the ticket is purchased for.  The facility will only accommodate 1000 people, so purchase your ticket(s) early!</P>

<P>Brother club:  Our brother Rotary club, Metropolitano of Monterrey, Mexico, is interested in a student exchange.  The young man who is interested in sharing experiences is about 15 years old.  Do you have or know someone this age who might be interested in exchanging? (Rotarian family or not)  Please contact me (928-8780).SER-Jobs for Progress has offered us some furniture that needs to be repaired and then can be donated to our brother club.  Do you have any ideas on how to transport it to the border?  Please contact me or Christian Puente (385-7556).</P>

<P>Other:  Attendance is required at our Club Assembly on October 29.  After lunch, we'll excuse our visitors and have a work session.  Also put on your calendar a club fellowship at the Boy Scouts office on the 29th at 5:30 p.m., for those who can make it.</P>

When the East Austin Rotary Club gets into fund-raising mode -- watch out! The date for the Skeet Shoot had been set when the opportunity to work with Austin artist Fidencio Duran became a reality.  Since his project has a very short time frame, we had to launch the poster sales project on the same day as the Skeet Shoot, August 25.  A wet East Austin Rotary team assisted with the latter event at Parque Zaragosa Recreation Center.<p>

The First Annual East Austin Rotary Club Fun Shoot on Sunday, August 25, was a success, despite the rain!  We had 22 shooters who braved the elements.  Many thanks are due to the Anderson family -- Dave, Kathy, Brenda, and Brian -- for their tremendous work, and to BFI for the support of this firsttime event.  We also want to thank the volunteers: Margarine Beaman, Jack Bell, Nora Comstock, James Carter, Tink Hill, Don Palmer, and Jim and Mary Ann Smith.  Tink brought one of our international visitors from Tanzania, Johnson Kileo, to participate in the shoot.  Look for more details in next month's newsletter.  A prize was donated by Berox Corporation d/b/a DJ Blueline, a $25 gift certificate for copying or enlarging.<P>

The poster project is going well.  The poster prices are $15 unsigned, $25 signed, and $55 signed and framed.  So far, venues for poster-signing events include:  Central Market, Thurs  Fri, Sept. 5  6, 5-7 P.M.  El Sol y La Luna Restaurant, Sun., Sept. 8, 11-2  First Tuesday, Sept. 3, at 823 Congress First Tuesday is a
blast!  We'll be at the Austin Museum of Art downtown facility, so come by and see us!  We also need volunteers, wearing our club t-shirts, to assist with poster sales.  Call me at 928-8780.<P>

The Austin Area Urban League has asked our club to work with other groups on the annual celebration of youth who are &quot;Doing the Right Thing,&quot; on Saturday, September 21.  We'll have more details
soon.<P>

We'll have a booth at CHARITech on Wednesday, September 18, and we'll be calling on club members to staff it.<P>

<B>Congratulations to club member Elmer Akins, who appeared in the August 1996 issue of  The Rotarian.  There is a photo and write-up on page 50 of his 50 years in radio.  What a man! </B><P>

<B>Vic Niemeyer wrote a guest editorial, &quot;It's time to revisit hard line with Cuba,&quot; which appeared in the August 19 issue of the Austin American-Statesman.</B><P>

<B>Congratulations also to Ramon Gil, who became a U.S.. citizen on August 10 in San Antonio</B>!<p>

Nora Comstock<P>

<HR>

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">From the past President-elect</H4>

<P>Each member of our club is challenged to develop a one minute (yes, 60 seconds) testimonial about the Rotary Club of East Austin to share with prospective members.  We live in an age of &quot;sound bites,&quot; so let's all tell others why we are members of our club!<P>

I offered this first testimonial at the August 20 meeting:   When I became a charter member of the Rotary Club of East Austin, I wanted to be a part of a positive, energetic, and inclusive group of people committed to serving East Austin and the world community through Rotary International.  <I>I have not been disappointed!</I><P>

I have met interesting people whom I probably would not have met otherwise.  I have learned of community needs in East Austin and how some of those needs are being met.  I have helped with immunization clinics, Keep Austin Beautiful cleanups, tree planting in the Rosewood Greenbelt Arboretum, Meals on Wheels delivery, activities at the Conley-Guerrero Center, and joint meetings with our sister club in Monterrey, Mexico.<P>

We are a diverse group in our vocations and interests, but we are united in our desire to serve.  Come and join us!  Our goal is for a member to give a testimonial at each club meeting.  We can and will compete with all the election year sound bites!<P>

James Carter<P>

<HR>

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">From the Secretary</H4>

Congratulations to eight club members who had perfect attendance in August: Elmer Akins, Margarine Beaman, James Carter, Nora Comstock, Tink Hill, Ed Pe&ntilde;a, Clyde Prestwood, and Bruce Wilson.  Remember -- just because you can't get away on Tuesday at noon doesn't mean you have to have a Rotary-less week!  Check the bulletin board, the newsletter, and the weekly song sheets for make-up times and locations in the Austin area.<P>

<HR>

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">From the Board of Directors meeting</H4>

<ul>
<li>We need more drivers for our Meals on Wheels route.

Rotary has established a international committee to evaluate the status of women and make recommendations for Rotary action concerning women's issues. <P>

In September the annual conference of the International Computer Users Fellowship of Rotarians will include a seminar on effective computer communication within a Rotary district. <P>

More than 800 new Rotary clubs were formed during 1995-96, bringing the total to 28,205 clubs and the number of members to 1,206,112 worldwide.<P>

Rotary has begun a Permanent Fund Initiative, to train district representatives to communicate the significance of the Permanent Fund to U.S.. and Canadian Rotary clubs.  During the next year or
so, these persons will visit each of the clubs in their area to encourage Rotarians to strengthen their financial commitment to the Foundation.<P>

<center><h1>Sun City Georgetown, TX</h1></center>
<center><h2>Emergency Procedures</h2></center>


<center><h4>When to call 911 and when to call Del Webb Security</h4></center>

If you have an emergency requiring immediate medical, police, fire, or other assistance, here's what to do in Sun City Georgetown: <p><font size=+1>

FROM A REGULAR TELEPHONE:</font>
<ol>
<li>call 911 first to report the problem</li>
<li>then call Del Webb Security at 818-0635

<dl>Del Webb Security will dispatch a car to your home immediately, and a car to Del Webb Blvd to escort the emergency response vehicle to your home.</dl>  

<li>turn your porch light switch to the middle position so the light will blink, to identify your house quickly to the emergency response vehicles as they arrive.
</ol>

<center>
<font size=+1> FROM A CELLULAR TELEPHONE</font><br>
 IN SUN CITY OR ELSEWHERE IN THE CITY OF GEORGETOWN<p>
</center>

<strong>Do NOT dial 911!</strong> If you do, you will be connected to the Austin 911 operator and it will take a while to straighten out the confusion.


<ol>
<li>DO DIAL the Georgetown Police Dept. at 930-3510; the operator here is also the 911 operator for Georgetown. 
<li>call Del Webb Security at 818-0635, as above.</li>

<H2>I've Got The Rhythm</H2>

<B>by Danny McCoy</B><P>

<hr noshade><p>

	Some managers are not well known for their Rhythm.  Normally, it is not something that you would expect.  But you need to know that I've got rhythm.  Now, I'll have to admit that I wasn't born with it.  In my early formative years, I did listen to Lawrence Welk's - anda one anda two.  So, you see it was something that I had to learn.  It is the seasons of the year. It is the ebb and flow of the business cycles.   It is being in step with your residents' needs.    It means not booking the Cinco de Mayo festival in August or wondering why that outdoor luau in January was a flop.  It even took me a while to understand why that Halloween Party at that first club I managed didn't draw very well on that Fourth of July weekend long ago.  Every once in a while I miss the beat again - a New Year's Eve Party in October  (but didn't we have fun?).  Luckily for Sun City, I made most of my mis-steps somewhere else.  We even managed to host a successful Rhythms of Texas Grand Opening -  At this point in my career, I am in sync, well as close as I will ever get.

	Take Thanksgiving weekend for instance.  Based on the rhythm of the past, we should be offering some support services for our residences.  We know that those of you who will stay in the Georgetown area will probably have relatives or house guests in for the holiday weekend. And you know what Ben Franklin said about that - Fish and house guests begin to stink after five days.  So, to make it a bit easier for you and your guests, make reservations now for our big Thanksgiving Buffet on Thursday, November 28 and then plan to bring those relatives back down to Legacy Hills Restaurant on Saturday morning November 30 for a Pancake Breakfast. Save the cooking and the cleaning up for those of us that have the Sun City Rhythm.  Our employees are constantly learning some new steps to better serve you.  And this year we've decided to have the real New Year's Eve party on Tuesday, December 31.  You see, I do have this rhythm thing down.

<H2>Controlling Weeds</H2>

<B>by Bud Hudson</B><P>

<hr noshade><p>

	Weeds need to be removed from the landscape.  They compete with plants for nutrients and water, becoming more aggressive as they mature.  The best way to control weeds, is first you must identify the ones growing in your yard.  If you can't find them in a weed or plant identification guide, check your local county extension agent or local nursery.  Annual weeds and perennial weeds cause different problems, so you need to know which is which before you begin to control them.
<p>
	Most of the weeds you see in the landscape are annuals.  These weeds usually survive one season then eventually die.  However, annual weed are very prolific, producing thousands of seeds per plant.  These seeds will lie dormant in your soil, waiting for the proper time to germinate.  The key to controlling annual weeds is to control their seeding activity.
<p>
   To reduce or eliminate annual weeds in your landscape, you can control them either chemically or manually.  Chemical control can be achieved by applying pre-emergent herbicides at the proper time either in late summer or late winter.  Depending on the growing season of the weed.  Pre-emergent such as surflan, eptam are strongly recommended.  Always follow label directions for proper usage.  Manual control is also encouraged on any weeds that have sprouted.  It is always best to pull weeds when your soil is damp, thus making it easier to get the roots out.
<p>
   Also a post-emergent such as Roundup or Finale works good on these type of weeds.  Just be aware that these herbicides are non-selective herbicides and will kill or damage other plant material if they come in physical contact with this herbicide.
<p>
   Perennial weeds are weeds that return every season from existing root stock in the soil.  Examples of these weeds are nutsedge, thistle, bromegrass, bermudagrass in most cases. Pulling perennial weeds, only causes them to come up more often.  Root stock of perennial weeds can go down several feet.  The best control is by applying herbicides such as Roundup or Finale as soon as the weed emerges.  On some perennials it will take several applications.  Again please follow all label instruction on herbicides and only use the recommended amount as per label directions.

<H2>HALLOWEEN "BOO-FET"</H2>

<B>Thursday, October 31, 1996</B><P>

<hr noshade><p>

     Yes, it is going to be a great excuse to dress up.  So, come on down to the Legacy Hills Restaurant for the very first buffet in the new clubhouse. Be sure and call our receptionist at 864-1212 to let us know how many special spooks you will be bringing for the "boo-fet."  The "boo-fet" is available from 5:00- 7:00 p.m. and is priced at $9.95 + service charge and sales tax for adults, $4.95 + for children 6-12.

The Village Store is now open.  Its regular hours will be 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Monday - Saturday and 12:00 noon to 5:00 p.m on Sunday.  Initially during November and December, however, the Store will be more limited hours.  The direct line to Sue Alexander, the Village Store Manager, is 864-1234.  Sue has brought together a variety of inventory and still has quite a few options even after the Grand Opening Sale.  She always carries wrapping paper, stamps and a few drug sundries.   It is a great place to get a quick snack, coffee, muffin or cookie.  There are plenty of gift selections, logo merchandise and of course the Real McCoy forced Sue to stock a bounty of coonskin hats that all the little Sun City grandchildren will just have to have.  So if you have an item that you would like for Sue to carry, please let her know (as long as it is not a Davy Crockett or Daniel Boone type of hat, if  you know what we mean).

<B>Dinner Theater, Saturday, November 16</B>
<P>

In this election month it is only fitting that we celebrate the political process with a Murder Mystery Dinner Theatre.   So you are invited to a party!  Celebrate the mayor's victory. Everyone's going to be there . . . the mayor, his alcoholic wife, his movie star mistress, even his defeated political opponent.  Suddenly, it's lights out for the revelers.  It's MURDER!  It's MAYHEM!  It's FUN!  

Who is the victim?  Who's the murderer?  Who's left to run for office?  Join the party and maybe you'll be the next CANDIDATE for MURDER!  If you liked our last Dinner Theatre,  Last of the Red Hot Lovers, then you will just die laughing during this rendition.

A buffet dinner will be served from 6:00 - 7:15 p.m. and showtime is at 7:30 p.m.  The dinner and show are available for $25.00 per person which includes sales tax and service charge.  Reservations are required. Call 864-1212 or stop by the Association Office and you can pay in advance.

Several people in this community are organizing a Kiwanis Club in Sun City Georgetown that will meet weekly for a meal and social.  This Club will participate in fellowship and community service, especially focused on the needs of our youth in the area.

Kiwanis Lieutenant Governor Carl Starnes said he and several members of the clubs in the area will be calling on Sun City residents during November and plan to officially organize the Club in Sun City Georgetown by the end of November.

Please come to the Social Center for free refreshment at 2:00 p.m on November 5 to hear what a Kiwanis Club can do for you and your community.  This will be an informative and fun time to meet one another and to learn how you can inject into your weekly routine a very rewarding way to help your community and have fun.

Kiwanis is designed for individuals desiring personal involvement in the leadership and improvement of the community.  Kiwanis is a worldwide community service organization with more than 325,000 members in more than 82 countries.   There are currently over 8,600 clubs in the organization; sixteen of them are in the Georgetown/Austin area.  Membership is open to both women and men.  For more information about Kiwanis International and this local club, please call Mal Tuohy at 864-0028.  In the meantime we look forward to seeing you on November 5.

We are not talking Ship & Shore, Feather & Fin, Pond & Pasture, Hoof & Feather, or Steak & Lobster.  We are talking about America's favorite -  Pizza & Beer.  On Tuesday, November 19, a night that the Legacy Hills Restaurant is closed, representatives from the Senior Security Estate Plans, Inc. will be on hand to pass the Pizza and give you a choice of brews for simply listening to their consultation on successful retirement planning.  Chow time is 6:00 p.m. (no need  to come  real early, because the pizzas won't be delivered until 5:59 p.m.).   The informational program will begin shortly thereafter and as last time there will be Color TV offered as a door prize.  You will need to make a reservation, so call 864-1212.

<H2>Tell Me </H2>
<hr noshade><p>

<B>by Danny McCoy</B>
<P>

Friday, November 22 at 8:30 a.m. will be the third Tell Me format and the last one as we go into this holiday season.  We will resume this monthly town hall forum in January.  Now some of you have asked me - Why I am doing this?  You see, it is not really a question in search of an answer.  It is query laced with a concern that I may be missing a few cylinders.   I have to admit that I have always wanted to be a part of that carnival game. You know the one. It is called the Dunking Booth.  Everybody lines up and pays a  $1.00 to get three balls.  The object is to throw a ball hard enough to hit the trigger that releases the seat that sends the rube flailing his arms to break the cotton candy encrusted surface of 250 gallons of stagnant cold water.  Sounds like fun to me.

   You see I have developed empathy for that Midway roustabout.  I know that sinking feeling when somebody steps up and pays their $54 a month and hurls a comment at the most convenient target.  I may be all wet, but we welcome you tosses.  How else are you going to know if you don't ask?  There are no silly questions.  We may not know all the answers and some of the resolutions will not be found in the Community Association Dunking Booth and certainly beyond our charter, responsibilities and resources, but we promise to make a big splash on your behalf  until you feel that you have gotten a response.  It may not be the response that you will want to hear, but at least you will know that you were heard.

   So we encourage you to join the Community Association Staff in the Ballroom at the Social Center.  You don't have to tell the Staff  anything or offer a suggestion if you really don't won't to.  You can simply observe.  It is a great spectator sport.  If you hear the same question you can probably expect the same answer.  Don't get bored, just get up and get yourself  a free cup of coffee that we will be serving.  I'm going to insist that we also have some hot chocolate and plenty of towels this time. I starts to get cold in November. The first one in the Booth will Golf Pro, Ken Stier.  Posey Moore will have her swim cap on next and I will be sure to have my flippers.

<P>

Here in Customer Service we are always striving to improve are processes.  As a result based on homeowner's input, these are the results.  We now return all calls the same business day.  We are in the process of cross training our field personnel so that homeowner's will have one field representative for the life of the warranty on the homes.  We expect to implement this program by mid-November. We are going to start conducting Landscape classes quarterly depending on input.  They will involve seasonal tips for care and maintenance, Q&A, guest speakers from time to time.  These are tidbits of things to come.  Thank you for all the input and patience.  In closing and as always here are a couple tips to close with. These come from Rosemary Sullivan: 
<p>
1- To clean washable wallpaper: mix 1/4 cup liquid dish washing soap with 1 cup warm water and beat with a rotary beater into a stiff foam.  Scoop up only the dry suds and apply with a cloth or sponge.
<p>
2 - Light bulb broken off at the socket?  Unplug the lamp or turn off the circuit that the light fixture is on.  Then, wearing a heavy glove, take a wad of newspaper and press down and twist counter- clock wise on the top of the socket.

I cannot believe the Fitness Center has been open for nearly one month!  We have already observed so many changes and now we have  experienced the Grand Opening of our Village Center.  This morning while I was driving into Sun City at 7 a.m.  I observed a most glorious bright red sunrise and saw in the shadows several residents walking with vigor.  I smiled and felt even greater motivation to make Sun City Georgetown's Fitness Center the finest in the land.  It has been such a privilege to have had a role in the opening and operation of your Fitness Center.  We still have a long way to go and my staff and I embrace that challenge.
<p>
Aerobic schedules have been printed.  Aerobic Cards will be available for purchase at the Fitness Center beginning November 1, 1996. We will offer a range of classes which are primarily low-impact. We always appreciate your comments and suggestions and now have in place a log book for just that!  Check with the monitor for the red log book so that you may record your comments and compliments!   We will try to address and respond to your comments in a timely fashion which may include discussion at each month's Tell Me meeting.  
<p>
	Welcome new residents.  An orientation to the Fitness Center which emphasizes safety is required prior to using any of the facilities including the pools and spas.  We have standing orientations each Tuesday morning at 11:00 a.m.  There is no need to register for these orientations which take about 45 minutes to complete.  Most residents have found the orientations to be very helpful and informative.  If you are not able to attend the standing orientation, please contact the Fitness Center staff and they will be happy to coordinate a time that will work for you.
<p>
For those of you who took on the Practice New Year's Eve Challenge related to Fitness and Weight Loss goals, congratulations on your commitment.  The staff at the Fitness Center is here to help coach you along to meet your goals.

<H2>Fitness Tip:    THE AGE ANTIDOTE!</H2>
<hr noshade><p>

<B>from Len Kravitz, Ph.D.</B>
<P>
Research has discovered the following findings related to mature exercisers: 
<p>
<LI>Physical activity in elders has been linked to the prevention of some cancers, as well as reduced risk of heart disease, hypertension, osteoporosis, obesity, type II diabetes and osteoarthritis.
<p>
<LI>Mature adults who maintain high levels of cardiovascular endurance, strength and flexibility are less likely to need long term care.
<p>
<LI>Falls, which are the leading cause of fatal injuries in people over 75 years of age can be reduced dramatically through participation in exercise programs that improve balance and mobility.
<p>
<LI>Increased strength improves gait and bodily control and helps individuals function independently.  
<p>
<LI>Exercise is often associated with more effective stress management, fewer sleep disorders, enlightened mental outlook, reduced loneliness and lowered depression and anxiety.<p>

The America's Smithsonian Exhibition will be in Houston December 6 through January 12 at the Convention Center.  And your Community Association has 40 tickets. This may be the closest tour stop to Austin and certainly closer than Washington DC.  So, we have planned a day trip to tour America's closet on Thursday, January 9.

<p>We will depart for Houston at 7:30 a.m. for the 3 to 4 hour trek, arriving at approximately 11:30 a.m., tour the exhibit and leave for Georgetown at approximately 4:00 p.m. The package price of $38 includes bus transportation, continental breakfast, box lunch and afternoon snacks.  The tickets are limited so call 864-1212.  No don't call.  Since these passes were hard to come by, we are going to need for you to come by and prepay the $38 to reserve your spot.  Next trip will be Nordstroms in Dallas.

Dessert at 6:00 P.M. at the LHPP<br>
Departing for Southwestern University at 7:25 P.M.<br>
<p>
Well, Sun City and Southwestern University team up again to enjoy the finer things in life:  DESERT and a mad french girl that no one can  pronounce her name.  Truly a classic in dramatic literature, The Madwoman of Chaillot was written during the darkest days of World War II when Paris was under German occupation.  A fantasy of vaulting imagination and rare theatrical beauty, The madwoman of Chaillot pictures a delightfully deft countess who discovers that there is evil in the world and proceeds to dispose of it.  With her trio of similarly half demented ladies from other quarters of Paris and der friends she induces the money-Mad men and women to descend a staircase leading from a basement room to the endless, bottomless sewers of Paris. 
<p>
The Madwoman of Chaillot is a remarkable comedy.  Wonderfully imaginative, its romantic nonsense, its wit and wisdom are exhilarating in a theater that rarely gets off the ground of realism. Also playing:

<H2>The Draw Bridge Is Up</H2>
<hr noshade><p>

Rather, the draw to bridge is up among resident participation!  There have been over 50 players for the past three months.  Supply and demand theories tell me it is time to add more days of play.  (Supply and Demand being Ann and Dell) Play dates are always the first and third Thursday of the month at 1:00 P.M.- 4:00 P.M.  We are adding an additional Monday play day called Table Top Bridge Starting Monday, November 4, from 10:00 A.M. to 12:00 P.M.  Each resident must RSVP for each play day that you wish to attend.  The deadline for reservations is 3:00 P.M. the day prior to the day of bridge play.  
<p>
Some of you asked what  our (God Sent) ANGELS were and how to get put on the list.  A Bridge ANGEL is someone who signs up for the play day as an on-call bridge player.  If there happens to be an unexpected absence such, as a sudden urge to go Christmas Shopping an ANGEL will show up happy to play or happy to leave for another fun Sun City Adventure.  We have ANGELES signed up through January, but if you would like to sign up please state so at the play day and become heaven sent.

<P>
Many of you read the article in last months addition of The Sun Rays,  and shared the grief of the death of Someone Else.  Well, we have obviously overlooked several individuals. Yes, Someone Else, has gone over and beyond the call of civic duty to aid in the betterment of their community.  As a matter of fact, Someone Else has even gone as far as duplicating themselves.  Yes, Someone Else has inspired others to GET INVOLVED, therefore, enriching the lives around them and sharing that glow of self-worth and comrade we feel when we help others and the community.  Someone Else has stepped in and carried the level of caring and commitment to the highest level.  Whenever there was a job to do, a volunteer effort , or a meeting to attend, one phrase was on everyone's lips - "Let someone else do it."  Someone Else said, "I'd love to help and I'll bring three of my friends with me."  We all can identify Someone Else and their friends in a crowd be cause they are every where helping others.  The next time you see Someone else please ask them how can I GET INVOLVED?  If we all pitched in we all could be ordinary people doing extraordinary things. Please join those who feel that since of accomplishment by sharing their talents and energy with our community and applaud your neighbors for the work they  have accomplished to make our community a better place to live.    
<p>
Please join us in Applauding and better yet, add your name to this evergrowing list:  Ann Anderson, Bill and Bobby Boyce, Ina Browning, Jo Burgess,  Joel & Gail Coffman, Ruthie, Nathan & D.J. Corbell, Joan Cresse, Barbara Goodwin, Carroll & Sylvia Gregory, Patty Lasczo, Vernie Miller, Art and Ruth Niedermeier, Dot Riddle, Peter and Nancy Roll, Marge Sharp, and many more.  The combined effort, commitment, and expertise of these and other gallant community members  has made the community  what it is today. Thank you all!

<H2>A Small Town Christmas</H2>
<hr noshade><p>
<P>
Growing up in Houston, a small town Christmas was not what I had experienced or even thought twice about. I now have found and experienced the joyful glimmer of the small town Christmas or holiday here in Georgetown.  It all begins in November 15th with the Georgetown Hospital Auxiliary's Christmas in the Pink. This is an annual event you will not want to miss.  All proceeds benefit our local community-owned Georgetown Hospital. The Axillary works hard all year designing holiday flower arrangements and unique decorations to benefit the hospital.  The community lines up at the door Friday morning at 8:30 A.M. to be the first to pick up the hand made silk flower arrangement, wreath, nativity set, or orniment they picked out the night before out of the Christmas Wonderland Gift Shop.  (HINT:  The items are set up Thursday, for early display, but not sold until Friday, at 9:00 A.M.)  Numbers are given, in the order of arrival, to each individual that can't wait to stock their freezers for holiday guests and get togethers with homemade casseroles, breads, pastries, pies, cakes, candies, and other assorted goodies from the Pink Pantry. Emmm, emmm goooood! To top the morning off, everyone eats at the hospitalYou can even eat brunch or lunch at the Soup and Sandwich Luncheon from 10:30 A.M. - 1:30 P.M. (Lunch, dessert, and drink $5.00.)  
<p>
 Christmas Stroll is the second event of the season which begins about 5:30 P.M. on December 7th.  Here you will see... ( HINT,  HINT:  and could even participate in) the town parade.  I would love to see 40 Sun City Georgetown golf carts jazzed up in holiday red and green with all the bows and whistles in this years parade.  (You'll hear the hard pitch later.)  Many non-profit and profitable organizations raise money by sponsoring  live nativity scenes, craft tables, holiday food items, Santa is there to visit with the children and is the hit of the parade while he and Mrs. Clause are on the back of the largest fire truck the city owns. I don't want to describe any more because I can't possible due the event justice or describe the ambiance the town has as it unites together to celibrate.  
<p>
Now, is where I give you the hard pitch.  Please come by the Social Center office after November 10, and pick up your Christmas Stroll golf cart entry number.  I will have prizes for the most original, eliminating, and last but not least, the cart that best illistrates Sun City lifestyle.

<title>Sun City Georgetown Internet/Computer Club:Special Interest Groups (SIG)</title>
</head>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">
<center><h1>Sun City Georgetown Internet/Computer Club</h1></center>
<center><h3>Potential Special Interest Groups (SIGs)<BR>
September 15, 1996</h3></center>
To serve the interests and needs of the diverse membership, the Club will be segmenting its activities and working more through Special Interest Groups , with meetings and programs addressed to the entire membership occurring less frequently.  The Special Interest Groups identified so far as needed now or in the near future, are<P>

<B>Beginners Interest Group (BIG):</B>  Through October 1996, at least, the weekly Monday afternoon meetings will all be aimed at "beginners:"
<UL>
<LI>those who consider themselves to be beginners in some sense; and 
<LI>those who are more experienced and willing to assist beginners in small-group settings;
<LI>this includes almost all of us, so just come to the weekly meetings! </UL><P>

<B>Applications Interest Group (AIG-heads):</B>  a catch-all SIG for the various special interests that exist among members, ranging from keeping up with emerging technology and new applications to learning how to use certain applications to pursuing special applications areas such as genealogy, investment management, digital photography, etc.  Initially, this SIG can offer a variety of programs, but as the membership grows, it will split into separate SIGs covering specific interest areas. <P> 

<B>Internet Users' Group (NetUG):</B>  Those interested in learning how to use the Internet and the WorldWideWeb, ranging from beginners to those who want to learn how to do and find things more effectively and keep up with new developments.  Because the Internet is so new to most residents, the difference between beginners and the more advanced is not so great.<P>  

<B>Sun City Georgetown Community Information Network (SCGTCIN):</B>  Those willing to contribute effort to maintaining and expanding the Sun City Georgetown WorldWideWeb site into a community information resource.  We will need two kinds of participants in this SIG:
&bull;	maintaining and updating the Web site (some technical skills or willingness to learn needed); and
&bull;	gathering and preparing information for inclusion on the Web site (technical skills unnecessary; interests in news reporting, writing, design/layout more important); e.g., reporting on community meetings and events, preparing reports on special topics of interest to residents; collecting useful information (frequently-asked questions) from a variety of sources. <P> 

<B>Computer Lab Committee:</B>  As soon as a Lab facility is ready for use in the Crafts Building, we will be expected to manage its use by developing a set of Rules & Procedures; to provide volunteer monitors during the hours it is open; and to fund the operating expenses of the Lab.   The Computer Lab Committee is at work on these tasks.  Volunteers are needed to serve as Monitors (minimum experience needed; training will be provided); and staff to manage the Lab operations and volunteers.  
<P>

<B>Education & Training Committee (ETC):</B>  This group will be charged with setting standards for the Computer Lab; defining and arranging training for Computer Lab monitors; and recommending and setting up training and education classes for the membership.

<title>Sun City Georgetown Internet/Computer Club:Mentor Program</title>
</head>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">
<center><h1>Sun City Georgetown Internet/Computer Club</h1></center>
<center><h3>
<B>An Outline of the Mentoring Program
 <BR>to assist beginners with computers and the Internet</B></center>
<P>
</B>The survey form developed by Orin Sharp and Jack Miller will enable us to identify small groups of 2-4 beginners with similar backgrounds and needs for start-up assistance.  <P>

Each such group will be paired with a more experienced member (someone who knows a little more and has done the things that the beginner group needs to do).  
<P>
This mentor will work with the beginners group in one or two sessions of an hour or two, using his or her home computer equipment.  (When a community Computer Lab facility is ready, it will be used in place of home facilities.) <P>

What you can expect help with and what you've got to do for yourself as a beginner with computers and the Internet:<P>


The Mentor will help by 
<UL><LI>identifying and demonstrating each component of the computer system and software and each process needed to get up and running on the computer and on one or two common applications (e.g., word processing);
<LI>answering questions and proceeding at a pace and level suited to the particular beginners group; 
<LI>sometimes providing some hands-on experience (easier when we have a community Lab); 
<LI>recommending appropriate books and reading; and 
<LI>providing some advice on how to utilize computer books and manuals most effectively;
<LI>acting as a telephone consultant after the initial sessions to answer questions, help deal with problems, and sometimes refer particular questions and problems to other residents more likely to have the answers.  
</UL>
Beginners should expect to spend time reading appropriate tutorial and reference books and manuals to learn the details of how to use their computer equipment.  Using their own equipment, they should try out what they have learned as they read.  The mentors will give some guidance on how to use reference and tutorial materials most effectively, based on their own experience; and how to go back and forth between reading and trying out what you are reading. <P>

<H2>
The Sun City Georgetown Computer Lab is scheduled to open on January 13!
</H2>

<hr noshade><p>
Equipment has been ordered! <br> 
A Computer Lab Committee is at work organizing the many details of operating a Computer Lab: 
<UL>
<LI>developing rules and procedures
<LI>recruiting and training Lab monitors
<LI>devising activity logs and reporting forms
<LI>developing an inventory of equipment and supplies
<LI>etc. etc. 
</UL>
<p>
 Equipment should be arriving during the first two weeks of December.  By the time it arrives, the Community Association will have designated and assigned space in the Crafts Building to house the Lab.  Club volunteers will be unpacking the equipment and software, setting it up, and checking it out during December.  In the first week of January, the Committee will organize work sessions to train Lab monitors and complete the remaining tasks required to place the Lab in operation.  
<p>
On Monday afternoon, January 13, we hope to have the Grand Opening of the Computer Lab for the Sun City Georgetown community.  Please help us with the work leading up to this, and come to see the results on January 13.

<FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="000066"><B>E</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="000066">stablished in 1970, the Teenage Parent Council of Austin, Inc., has been described as the first organization of its kind in the country. The council functions to facilitate the planning and coordination of services related to the prevention of adolescent pregnancy, and services to assure the well-being of adolescent parents, their children, and their families.<P>

Funding for the programs and projects of the Council has come from both public and private sources since its inception. One early grant from the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health assessed the needs for services to teenage parents. Public funding support from the Travis County Department of Human Services was received for the first time in 1974, and from the City of Austin Department of Housing and Community Services in 1982. Other foundations, including the Austin Community Foundation, March of Dimes, Trull Foundation, The Children's Trust Fund of Texas, the Lola Wright Foundation, and the Junior League of Austin, as well as many local businesses have provided grants for specific projects.<P>

In 1986, the Council began the first program of direct services to teens at risk for dropping out of school. The Stepping Stone Project, with trained volunteers, utilizes a lay case management approach to help pregnant and parenting teens stay in school and learn parenting skills. In 1993, funding from the City of Austin helped the Council open an office in the Dove Springs community of Austin to implement Stepping Stone as well as to pilot Growing Up and Making Healthy Choices, a school and community based prevention education program. Growing Up and Making Healthy Choices is now an on-going part of Teenage Parent Council services.<P></FONT>

<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">


<p><h1>Texas CASA, Inc.</h1>
<b><i>A Court Appointed Special Advocate program for abused children in Texas</i></b>
  
 <h2>What is CASA?</h2>
  All children need a home with loving people to care for
  them.  Each year in Texas, thousands of children are abused,
  neglected or abandoned.  Sometimes, these children must be
  removed from their homes and placed under the protection of
  the court and the state.
  
  <p>On average, a judge often has as little as 10 minutes to decide the fate of these victimized children.  Should they remain in foster care?  Be reunited with parents?  Or, be adopted?
  
  <p><b>Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASAs)</b> are trained volunteers involved in helping the courts deal with the
  overwhelmingly difficult and costly increase in child abuse in Texas.  Usually, the CASA volunteer is the <b>most consistent</b>
  person in a child's life during this time and provides the <b>only</b> independent voice for each abused child.

<p><h1>Texas CASA, Inc.</h1>
<b><i>A Court Appointed Special Advocate program for abused children in Texas</i></b>

<h2>What Does a CASA Volunteer Do?</h2>
  Lost in an overburdened child welfare system that cannot pay close attention to each child's needs, many children become
  victims a second time. <b> That's where CASA comes in.</b>
  
  <p>Appointed by District Judges, CASAs are trained volunteers who befriend the child and speak on his or her behalf in
  court.  Often, the CASA is the first consistent and trustworthy adult in an abused child encounters.  CASAs are committed.  They care.  They <b>make a difference</b> in the life of one child.
  
  <p>The CASA is responsible for taking the time to find out as much as possible about the child's circumstances.  CASAs
  search for information.  They review records.  Interview parents.  Talk to teachers, neighbors and, most importantly,
  the child.
  
  <p>CASAs appear in court and submit a written report with a recommendation about what's best for the child's future. 
  Judges, who often have as little as 10 minutes to make a decision about the placement of the child, take these recommendations very seriously.

<p>Your time and commitment as a CASA volunteer will make a difference in the life of a child!  Please contact Texas CASA to find out about the CASA program in Texas nearest you.  <b><a href="txcasa.htm">Return to Texas CASA's home page</a>.</b>

<h2>You Can Become a CASA or Help Start a CASA Program.</h2>
  Consider becoming a CASA.  You need to be a responsible adult who can offer stability to a child in crisis.  Time
  commitments vary with each child's case.  
  
  <p>A CASA is asked to commit at least a year to one child.  The average CASA spends 10 to 15 hours a month working with to help a child.  It's difficult work, yet very gratifying.  If you are interested in becoming a volunteer, contact your local CASA program or Texas CASA for more information.  To reach Texas CASA call 1-800-770-8042.
  
  <p>There are CASA programs operating in every state in the country and in more than 44 locations in Texas.  Yet, many communities still need CASA programs to speak up for children in court.  
<a href="http://www.nationalcasa.org/texas.htm"> To see a complete list of the CASA programs in Texas, please click on this link</a>.
  
  <p>If your Texas community does not have a program, Texas CASA can help you start one.  We offer resource material, funding (when available), training, referral and support.  Just write or call, and we'll be glad to help.

<h2><p><b><u>Statewide Fact Sheet</u></b></h2>
                                   
<p>The <b>Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA)</b> program was created because every year thousands of children are removed from their homes due to abuse and neglect.  These victimized children are subjected to criminal justice and child welfare systems that are poorly equipped to deal with their special concerns.  Eventually, these children end up in court.  Their only  crime  is that they have been victims; yet, they will be sentenced to months, if not years, in the state's custody.  CASA is a solid public/private partnership which is, perhaps, the most effective way to curb juvenile crime.  CASAs seek a safe, loving, <b>permanent</b> home for the at-risk child at the earliest possible moment in his or her life.
 
<ul>                     
<li><p>It is estimated that during fiscal year 1995, 107,895 child abuse and neglect reports were investigated in Texas.  Also, it is estimated that  more than 50,500 children were confirmed victims of abuse and 24,105 became wards of the state of Texas.
                              
<li><p>Appointed by District Judges, CASAs are volunteers involved in helping the courts deal with the overwhelmingly difficult and costly increase in child abuse cases.  <b>Usually, the CASA volunteer is the most consistent person in a child's life during this time and provides the only independent voice for each abused child.</b>
                
<b><li><p>Last year in Texas, 2,156 CASA volunteers contributed 336,669 hours speaking up for the best interests of 5,649 abused and neglected children in our state who were involved in the court system.  Currently, there are 44 CASA programs in Texas providing volunteer advocacy to the neediest of our children.</b>
              
<li>When a CASA is assigned to a case, the time a child spends in foster care is <u>reduced</u> from the statewide average of 27.1 months to 17 months.  The average direct cost of foster care is $16,479 per child per year.  This does not include court costs, state caseworkers' salaries or other administrative expenses. <b> The savings to the state of Texas: $77.5 million in direct foster care for FY 1994-95.</b>
</ul>

<CENTER><H1>Licensing</H1></CENTER>

A professional license allows engineers to legally represent 
themselves to the public as an engineer, offer consulting 
engineering services to private and public entities and 
perform engineering design or construction on public works.  
Licensed engineers must also adhere to the code of ethics 
and professionalism established by the Professional 
Engineers Board.  Engineers may become licensed if they 
possess an approved engineering degree, have completed at 
least a four - year internship and have passed the national 
Fundamentals of  Engineering  and the Principles and 
Practice of Engineering Examinations.  For more information

<CENTER><H1>Consumer Complaints and Enforcement</H1></CENTER>

The board and staff enforce the Texas Engineering Practice 
Act and rules of conduct on both licensed engineers and 
unlicensed impostors of engineers.  Persons that offer to 
practice engineering when they are not licensed commit a 
criminal offense.  The Enforcement department is available 
to the public to receive complaints on license status and to 
provide general guidance on the activities of the 
engineering profession in Texas. <P>

How to file a complaint:
<UL>
<LI>call the Enforcement department to verify that the case is 
within the board's jurisdiction. 
<LI>send a letter describing the details of the situation to 
enforcement;  please provide sufficient evidence such as 
names of  witnesses, plans, specifications or other sources 
of proof within the letter.
<LI>return a completed complaint form to the board
</UL>



The Enforcement department will send a confirmation letter 
concerning the case.  The department will also notify the 
respondent of the case as it progresses and the conclusion 
of the investigation.  All cases are subject to a board 
review at the board meeting closest in date to the closure 
of the investigation.  The board meets on a quarterly basis 
throughout the year.  For more information contact the 
enforcement department.<P>

<DL>
<DT><B><A HREF="tnrcadv.htm"> 10-95-A  Petroleum Storage Tank Sites</A></B>
<dd>Discussions took place between the Texas Natural Resource 
Conservation Commission and the Texas State Board of 
Registration for Professional Engineers during the summer of 
1995 to develop a common understanding of the definition of 
engineering.  The need for clarification arose because of 
confusion concerning the roles the scientific and 
engineering professionals have on corrective action for the 
leaking petroleum storage tank sites. 
<P>
<DT><B><A HREF="advscho.htm"> 10-95-B  School Construction Policy</A></B>
<dd>The state of Texas adopted the Texas Engineering Practice 
Act in 1937 to protect the safety and well being of all 
people within the educational school system.  Since the 
creation of the law, there has been some confusion over the 
roles an engineer and architect play in the supervision, 
design, and construction of  school facilities. 
<P>
<DT><B><A HREF="advseal.htm"> 11-95-A  Sealing Rule</A></B>
<dd>The purpose of the engineer’s 
seal is to assure the user of the engineering product that 
the work has been performed by the professional engineer 
named and to delineate the scope of the engineer’s work. The 
board strongly encourages the engineer to utilize the 
designation P.E. on all correspondence and in conjunction 
with all engineering performed.  The seal shall be used as 
noted in this section and in other board rules. 
<P>

<DT><B><A HREF="cpcadv.htm"> 11-95-C   Continuing Professional Competency</A></B>
<dd>CPC is a voluntary professional development program 
implemented by the board  to recognize engineers for 
continuing their training and education in engineering.
<P>

<DT><B><A HREF="trusshp.htm"> 04-96-A   Truss Policy Advisory</A></B>
<dd>In response to a request from the Texas Department of Insurance,
the Texas State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers
developed Policy Advisory 04-96-A. This advisory outlines a structural
engineer's scope of responsibility in engineering projects related
to custom-manufactured products including trusses.
<P>

<DT><B><A HREF="txdot2.htm"> 06-96-A   Materials Testing and Analysis</A></B>
<dd>Discussions took place between the Texas Department of Transportation
and the Texas State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers
during the fall of 1995 to develop a common understanding of the
definition of engineering as it relates to the purchase of engineering
services including materials testing and analysis. The need for
clarification arose because of confusion concerning the roles
that the scientific and engineering professionals play within
the scope of those services.

<H1>Information on Cerebral Palsy</H1>
<DL>
<DT><I>What is cerebral palsy?</I>
<DD>Cerebral palsy is the most prevalent life-long physical disability in America.  Yet a surprising number of people are not quite sure just what it is.  Cerebral palsy is a condition caused by physical damage to the brain, usually occurring before, during or shortly following birth.  "Cerebral" refers to the brain and "palsy" refers to the lack of motor control.  In addition, the child or adult with cerebral palsy may experience seizures, mental retardation and impairments of sight, hearing and/or speech.  The degree of involvement varies.  Cerebral palsy is not progressive, communicable, inherited or a primary cause of death.  Nor is it "curable" in the accepted sense, although an individual with cerebral palsy often responds positively to training and therapies.  It is not a disease and should never be referred to as such.<P>

<DT><I>What causes cerebral palsy?</I>  
<DD>Any damage to the brain -- delayed development, injury or disease -- may result in cerebral palsy.   Some of the chief causes are an insufficient amount of oxygen reaching the fetal or newborn brain, a traumatic birth injury, infections during pregnancy, post-natal head injuries, brain infections or brain hemorrhages.  Outside of birth injuries, the most frequent cause of cerebral palsy is head injury resulting from motor vehicle accidents, falls or child abuse.<P>

<DT><I>How many people have cerebral palsy?</I>  
<DD>Approximately 53,000 children and adults in Texas have cerebral palsy. In the U.S. it is estimated that 700,000 children and adults have the condition.  Annually, it is estimated that 3,500 to 4,000 infants are born with this condition and an additional 1,500 pre-school age children acquire cerebral palsy as the result of accidents or abuse.<P>

<UL>
<LI>Persons with psychiatric disabilities showed significantly better employment outcomes when they are provided early entry into jobs (place and train model) rather than following the "train then place" model of employment services.(1)

<LI>Fewer than half of young adults with disabilities who leave high school are employed full-time in competitive employment.(2)

<LI>Young adults with mild disabilities were employed the most often after leaving high school, followed by those with hearing disabilities, visual disabilities, physical disabilities, mental retardation and, last, severe disabilities.(2)

<LI>More than 52% of Texans with disabilities live below the poverty level.(4)

<LI>All measures of quality of life increased significantly for employees with disabilities who moved from sheltered workshops to competitive community employment.(5)

<LI>Over 90% of individuals with disabilities who had experience in both supported employment and sheltered workshops indicated a preference for supported employment.(6)

<LI>Supported employees earned $1.41 for each $1 spent on services, while sheltered workshop workers earned only $ .26 for each $1 spent.(7)

<h2>Small Business Roundtable</h2>



<h3>Introduction</h3>


The Greater Austin Small Business Roundtable put this
information together to help you as you examine the ability of
starting your own business. We hope this kit provides a good
starting point for your business ventures!<p>


Contrary to the late night "info-mercials", newspapers
advertisements touting "unlimited income potential", and
traveling business "snake-oil" salesmen, starting a business is
not as easy as snapping your fingers. In the real world it takes
time, effort, investigation, and business savvy. You will need
to create a document, called a business plan, that describes
your proposed opportunity. The following information will guide
you through this process of discovery. There are hundreds of
books written about small business development and college
courses dedicated to the subject, and obviously this brochure
can not be all-inclusive. We can provide some basic knowledge
and indicate where you can go in Austin for additional
assistance.<P>



<h3>Personal Factors</h3>

So you want to be in business for yourself. What are you able to
bring to the new venture? There are many traits that researchers
have identified:<p>
energy, independence, confidence, empathy, sense of ethics,adaptability, imagination, inquisitiveness, boldness, good health, tact, perseverance, self-discipline, good sense of timing, self-control, innovative, good judgment, strong will<p>

In addition to identifying your personal traits that will assist
you in your venture you will need to be honest about why you are
entering this business. Ask yourself:<p>

What am I looking for? Are my goals realistic? Am I willing to struggle and make sacrifices? Do I have common sense?<br>
Do I have good managerial skills? Do I have enough experience in this area? Am I more of a doer than a dreamer?<p>

These questions and self analysis will help you honestly
evaluate your aptitude for owning a small business. Some people
do not realize how much they are giving up to enter into
business. For example, maybe a current employer provides premium
health care coverage, a matching retirement plan, or a stable
working schedule. These are some of the "opportunity costs" of
going into business, and should not be taken lightly.<p>



<h3>Requirements for Starting Your Business</h3>


There are several requirements you will need to address to start
your new business. Once you have a created a name, you will need
to decide on the structure of your company. Most small business
start as a sole proprietorship or partnership, and when they
become profitable, then they tend to incorporate. Incorporation
provides more liability protection for the owners, however there
are higher costs involved. How much liability are you willing to
assume when you start? After you have decided on a structure,
you then need to examine the requirements for having employees
and making timely sales and tax payments. Consult the
<a href="numbers.htm">"Frequently Called Telephone Numbers"</a> for phone numbers for the
various groups that you will need to contact while starting your
business.<p>



Registering the name of your business: You must obtain an
Assumed Name Certificate (DBA) at the County Clerk after
verifying that the name you have chosen has not already been
registered in the county. You can perform the name search in the
County Clerks office. The cost to register the business name in
Travis County is $9 plus $.50 per owner. The filing is valid for
10 years.<p>



State Sales Tax Permit: Businesses involved in selling, renting,
leasing, or providing taxable items or services must obtain a
Sales Tax Permit from the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts.
This office also assesses the annual state franchise tax for a
Texas corporation. There is no cost to obtain the sales tax
permit.<p>



Employer Identification Number (EIN): This federal tax number is
required by all businesses except sole proprietorships with no
employees. This number is used to file empioyer tax to file
employer tax returns, make deposits of employment taxes and file
business tax returns. This number is obtained from the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) and there is no cost for the number.<p>



Employer requirements: Besides obtaining the EIN and depositing
payroll taxes, employers must comply with severai other
requirements. The unemployment rate is paid to the Texas
Workforce Commission (formerly known as Texas Employment
Commission or TEC). Employer should also contact the U.S.
Department of Labor, Wage, and Hour Division and OSHA Division,
regarding employer requirements including the display of certain
posters where they can be easily seen by employees and
applicants. Also contact the Texas Department of Insurance and
the Texas Workers' Compensation Commission for information about
workers' compensation requirements and classification.<p>



Incorporation: Articles of incorporation must be filed with the
Secretary of State, Corporations Sections. There is a $300
filing fee for Texas corporations.<p>



Licenses and Permits: To determine if your business requires
Local, State, or Federal licenses or permits, contact the Texas
Department of Commerce, Business Information and Referral
Program. This office has a Comprehensive Application Form (CAF)
for Texas licenses and permits, and also has information about
local and federal requirements.<p>



Business Property Taxes: Property tax must be paid to the county
appraisal district on tangible personal property used to produce
income. Business owners must report all inventories, equipment
and machinery. The report is filed between January 1 st and
March 31st each year.<p>



Self-employment Tax: Because FICA is not withheld from
self-employed earnings, self-employment tax is paid to fund
social security and Medicare benefits. This is reported using a
Scheduie SE form filed with your income taxes.<p>



<h3><center>Market Analysis & Marketing Concepts</center></h3>



Bringing a company, product or service to market even on a local
basis can be very expensive. And bringing a product or service
to market nationaliy can cost $250,000 plus! Most businesses
start small and grow. None of us have money to waste and most of
us can not survive even one poor marketing decision.<p>



Marketing has both external components (customers) and internal
components (employees, suppliers, and vendors) and you must
clearly understand both in order to market successfully and be
profitable. So before you select a location, select staff, or
select and price your product or service; before you print those
brochures, business cards, and stationary; before you do
direct-mail marketing, before you place those ads in the Yellow
Pages, on radio, on TV or in newspapers and magazines...analyze
your market and your business. It may seem obvious, but many
companies make big mistakes. For example, a study found that
most people do not go out to eat because they are hungry or
because the food is good. They go out primarily to be pampered,
to have someone fill their needs and wants. Restaurants that
know what their customers really want stay in business, while
those that don't, don't.<p>



How do you know what business you're in?  You ask your customers
what it is they buy from you.  If you are just starting out and
don't have any costumers, you can still find the answer.  Conducting
a focus group with people who are like the customer you would
like to attract is probably the best way. The idea is to conduct
a small group discussion on a particular topic. For example, a
retailer discovered where the "customers" liked to shop, what
they expected when they stopped, what prices they were willing
to pay and what products and services were most important to
them. Although you can do this yourself, it is usually best done
by a marketing professional who knows what questions to ask and
is unbiased about the results. The key is not to prejudice the
group to give you answers that you want instead of answers you
need.<p>



You can obtain information though networking. Ask friends and
other people you respect about companies you believe to be your
competitors. What you want to know is what they are buying from
them and why. You can also find ways to contact people though
trade associations. Frequently, businesses in other cities will
share information; just make sure you talk to several to
increase the reliability of the information.<P>



All industries and businesses go through life cycles. You need
to know if the industry in which you operate is growing or
declining. Analyzing the state of your industry will show you
how to effectively market your products and services, and give
you a good idea on pricing. In addition to public libraries, the
Texas Comptroller's office can also give you vital information
on both trends in Texas and in the major metropoiitan areas,
including Austin.<p>



Look at consumer trends as well, even if you are planning on
doing business only with other businesses. The population, on
average, is getting older. There is a growing Hispanic market as
well as other minority groups with which you may want to do
business. Finally, look at social, legislative, and economic
trends that would have an impact on the success of your company
and the marketability of your products and services.<p>



Why should any customer buy from you? How can you identify and
minimize their risk? How can you make it easy for customers to
buy from you? What makes you unique? Analyzing your strengths
and weaknesses and comparing them to major competitors is an
absolute must. How much you charge depends on first on how much
you need per unit (or per hour) to pay your expenses. After
that, price is determined by the market. Charge too little and
customers don't think your product is worth much; charge too
much and they will not buy. Do not just copy what your
competition charges - they may not be as smart as you. Also
remember that small businesses cannot compete on price alone,
unless you are in the discount business, you will likely lose.<p>



You will want to compare your policies and procedures to others
in the industry. Also double check that you have not omitted
anything or that someone has not already found a way to solve a
problem that could help you, too. In addition, analyze the
strengths and weaknesses of suppliers and production and
delivery methods (work flow). This can have a direct effect on
your marketing efforts and success. What you want to do is
identify current problems and determine the implications
(monetary, staffing, and marketing) of increased sales or other
potential changes to increase profitability. For example, if you
want to gear up to sell more, can your suppliers meet your
requirements? Can your staff handle a sudden increase of sales?
Finally, analyze how your industry and, in particular, your
major competitors are marketing. How successful do they seem to
be? What weaknesses do you see?<p>



Marketing analysis takes time, but it saves money, prevents
major mistakes, and may keep you in business. It allows you to
make informed marketing and management decisions. Without this
baseline information, it is difficult for you to identify
attainable goals, determine priorities or ensure the
profitability of any given decision. Your analysis becomes the
basis for developing a cost-effective marketing plan with a way
to evaluate results using the baseline of information you
established. It ensures that your business can support increased
sales, there is a market that will make the company more
profitable, and that no aspect of the business has been
overlooked that could endanger profitability. (Source: Jan F.
Triplett, Ph.D., Co-director Entrepreneurs' Association)<p>



<h3><center>Small Business Finance</center></h3>

How much money will you need to start? When will you break even?
Will yXour business make mnnPwX Hnw mt h? How do vou know? These
are all cuestions that vou cari answer, with a little investigation.
Many entrepreneurs try to "wing it" hoping sales volume will increase
while their costs decrease. These people usually end up as just another failed small business statistic.<p>



Many people ask "How can I forecast if I am not even in business
yet?" It can be done by researching in the library and by asking
people already in your field. To start go to the business
reference section of the library and find the books by RMA
(Robert Morris & Associates), Dun & Bradstreet, or the Almanac
of Business and Industrial Ratios. These books break down
business by industry and provide valuable starting points for
the entrepreneur. For example, if you were going to start a
small restaurant, the RMA will give you a simple percentage of
the national average for expenses are. These expenses are broken
down by category. You now have a starting point for projecting
the future. After you get the national averages, you will want
to break each category down and get firm quotes from insurance
agents, builders, etc. By plotting your monthly expenses and
revenues, you will be able to do "what if7' analysis. What if
sales are 20% higher than anticipated? 20% lower than
anticipated? The cost of your goods that are sold increases 10%?
What would you need to do if this happened. Once you have a firm
understanding of your costs and your market and have completed
your business plan, you are then better able to seek funding, if
needed, for your venture.<p>



There are several sources of raising funds available to the
small business. The most common, of course, is obtaining a loan
through a bank. The SBA's Low Doc program is tailored for
businesses needing under $100,000 and has a single page (front
and back) application. In addition to loans, over 30% of all
small business are started from the owners savings, family, and
friends. Many entrepreneurs have funded their ventures by using
their personal credit cards, a risky strategy. Some
entrepreneurs look for investors or partners to provide the
needed capital. Future customers have been known to help fund a
company if they think it will benefit them in the long run in
terms of higher quality, lower costs, or stability of supply.<p>



What do most investors look for? Investors of all types receive
a large number of proposals each year. Is there some secret or
lending conspiracy for obtaining funding? No, most investors
look at the same criteria. The following criteria, know as the
"Six C's", represent the necessary starting point if you hope to
be heard by an investor. The relative importance of each of
these categories varies by the investor.<p>
Character, Credentials, Concept, Capability, Cash Flow, Collateral<p>

If you wait for your accountant to tell you what you did in the last period, it's too late to adapt.<p>



<h3><center>Small Business Assistance Groups</center></h3>

marketplace. ATI provides a proactive environment to allow
entrepreneurs to develop newer technologies with a greater

A technology-based incubator is a place where several new
businesses can develop under one roof. A technology entrepreneur
enters the incubator with his or her idea, service, or product.
The start-up business "incubates" while the firm develops and
brings its product to market. Eventually, the technology firm
matures to the point where it can graduate from the incubator
and continue its development as a viable enterprise. The
incubator provides low overhead and many shared resources of
high-quality professional assistance and advice in such areas as
accounting, law, marketing, finance, engineering, and management.<p>

<h4>The Capital Network</h4>
The Texas Capital Network (TCN) addresses the critical funding
needs of entrepreneurial ventures which typically do not meet
the investment criteria of large institutional funding sources.

appropriate investors in search of opportunities, TCN has helped
place over $25 million since 1991. TCN also sponsors educational
seminars which have been attended by thousands of entrepreneurs,

Inscribe your name on a tile; imprint your foot in concrete;
certify your practical idealism and create a permanent memory on
Town Lake.<p>

Inscribe a tile with a name -for a birthday, graduation,

you'll be helping a worthy cause.<p>

The money raised will be used to relocate Norwood house, a
1920's structure located on a city park on the northwest corner
of IH-35 and Riverside Drive. Every $300 moves the house one
foot closer to its original site. If you can't give us a foot,
give us an arch ($200), heel ($100), big toe ($50) or even a
pinky ($20).<p>

Download the order form and fill it in. Then make your check
payable to WCCT Education Fund and mail it and the form to WCCT

    <font size="5">T</font>his document is for individuals that
    have just gotten connected through a national Internet
    service provider and don&iacute;t realize they can save on
    their costs by selecting a local service. This document was
    written for the US market and may not apply in other
    countries. <br>
    <br>
    Many find it easier to get started by joining one of the
    national service providers such as America Online (AOL),
    Prodigy or Compuserve. These services are a great way to get
    started, but may not be your best buy over the long-term. You
    should shop around for an Internet service provider (ISP)
    that services your local area. Most local ISPs are less
    expensive than the national providers because they
    don&iacute;t need to cover any long distance telephone costs.
    When you connect to a national ISP, you are usually paying
    for the long distance phone costs as part of your hourly
    rate. The local ISPs don&iacute;t have this cost and so it is
    not passed on to you.<br>
    <br>
    Locating and selecting a local ISP can be a challenge. First
    you have to find them and then you must know how to evaluate
    the quality of their service. Here are a few tips:<br>

        <h2><a name="evaluating">Evaluating an Internet Service
        Provider</a> </h2>
        <p>There are a number of questions you can ask each ISP
        that will help in evaluating their quality of service.
        Here are some suggested questions:<br>
        <br>
        What is their peek traffic hours of each day and what is
        their busiest day of the week? This tells you that if you
        plan to use the Internet at the same time they are
        peeking, you may get a busy signal when trying to
        connect.<br>
        <br>
        Ask them what their policy is on avoiding busy signals.
        You will have to judge their answer, but they should at
        least have a policy and be able to share that with you.<br>
        <br>
        What type of modems do they use, both speed and brand
        name. Speed is important if you are using a 28.8 speed
        modem and all they have is 14.4. What will happen is your
        28.8 will automatically step down to their 14.4 speed
        resulting in slower performance. The brand is important
        is some cases. First, cheaper brands rarely perform as
        well as higher quality modems. Look for them to be using
        US Robotics, Practical Peripheral or Hayes modems These
        are recognized as some of the best performers in the
        market. In addition, you may gain even better performance
        if you are using the same brand as they are. This is true
        with US Robotics modems and may be true for other brands.<br>
        <br>
        Find out what days and hours they are available for
        technical support.<br>
        <br>
        Make sure you get a free test period of at least two
        weeks. Any quality operation will offer a free trial
        period.<br>
        <br>
        Ask them what their true band width to the Internet is.
        They need to be using a full T1 line or better (T3). If
        they tell you different, keep shopping. Bandwidth to the
        Internet is the quality of the ISP&iacute;s connection
        with a major Internet backbone provider like Sprint,
        AT&amp;T, or MCI. Although less common today, many ISPs
        choose to connect to the backbone with smaller bandwidth
        to save on costs. They pass this savings on to you, but
        it is no real bargain from a performance point of view.<br>
        <br>
        <img src="/images/yelline.gif" align="bottom" width="648"
        height="2"><br>
        </p>
        <h2>What should an account with a <a name="cost">local
        ISP cost</a>? </h2>
        <p>This will vary from one region of the country to the
        next, but most major metropolitan areas should have ISPs
        that offer sixty hours a month to unlimited usage for
        about $20 a month. At the high end, you should not be
        paying any more than $1 an hour in any metropolitan area.
        Rural may climb a bit higher, so you just have to compare
        the price with what you pay a national service. </p>

<H1>Equipment Requirements for Accessing the Internet</H1>

<P>Understanding what your computer equipment needs are can be very frustrating.  There are a host of variables to deal with and sorting it all out can drive you crazy.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
What CPU speed do you need?<BR>
How much disk space is required?<BR>
How much RAM should you have?<BR>
What modem speed is needed?<BR>
What kind of monitor is best?<BR>
Do you need CD ROM?<BR>
Is a multi-media package important?<BR>
Should you buy a Macintosh (Mac) or Windows PC?<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The answers to these questions change frequently as does the computer market.  New advances in computer equipment can leap as often as once every quarter.  These leaps cause the cost of older models to drop between $200 and $300 each quarter.</P>

<P>This rapid change in the industry makes it difficult to write a document that has any value over an extended period of time.  For that reason this document offers general guidelines that are applicable for 1996 - 97.  It looks at two distinctly different situations - buying new or upgrading old equipment.</P>

<H3>Buying New</H3>

<P>Start by looking at what is offered in the stores today.  Get a feel for what the average configuration is; CPU speed, disk space, RAM, and modem speed.  For example; in late 1996 an average Windows PC configuration would be a Pentium 100 series CPU with 16mb of RAM, between 1 and 2 gigabytes of disk space and a 28.8 modem.  You may want to go slightly higher than average, but avoid the high cost of top end configurations.  A example of slightly higher than average would be; a Pentium class CPU speed in the high 100 series with 24mb of RAM and 2.5gig of disk space.</P>

<P>Monitors are usually sold separately.  Don’t make the mistake of buying a less expensive monitor to save on your overall purchase price.  Get something in the middle of the price range.  Expect to pay between $400 and $500 for a good mid-range monitor.  Buying a cheap monitor will probably result in early repairs.  The added cost of a good monitor is about the same as purchasing an extended warrantee.</P>

<P>Purchasing an extended warrantee rarely pays off.  If a computer works for the first 90 days it will usually continue to work for three years.  Any repair you need will rarely exceed the cost of extending the warrantee.</P>

<P>You will be fine with either platform; Mac or Windows.  A Mac typically costs more, but most find it easier to learn.  You may want to avoid mixing a Mac at home with a Windows PC at work.  Folks will tell you it doesn’t cause problems with compatibility, and in the strictest sense this is true.  However, most Mac users find the mix frustrating.</P>

<P>CD ROM is an important feature to have these days.  Children like it for games and there are some good reference packages you can buy.  However, the average adult computer user will only use it for loading new software.  If you plan to use CD ROM for games or reference packages, speed is more important.</P>

<P>Multi-media features for sound and moving video are common on new computers.  Be realistic about what you plan to do with these features as they have a significant impact on the overall cost of your computer purchase.  A general trend in the industry is to package higher end multi-media options with the higher end computers.  This can be frustrating for the buyer that wants a little faster CPU speed, more RAM and disk space, but does not want the cost of high-end multi-media options.  You may have experienced similar frustrations when buying a new car.</P>

<B>Some things to remember:</B>

<UL>
<LI>Generally speaking, there are no good deals for the average consumer.  If the price of a computer package is significantly less than others there is a reason for it.  
<LI>Avoid bundled packages that include printer, scanner, cables and disks.  These packages are rarely a good deal.
<LI>You can never have enough RAM
<LI>You can always use more disk space
<LI>Your computer will be obsolete within three years
</UL>

<H3>Upgrading an Old Computer</H3>

In figuring out if your existing computer is capable of accessing the Internet, there are several components to look at:
<UL>
<LI>modem
<LI>monitor
<LI>disk space
<LI>RAM
<LI>CPU speed
</UL>

<P>The older your computer, the less likely it is configured for comfortable Internet use.  You may find that it is less expensive to buy a new computer than upgrade your existing one.  If your computer is three years old, or newer, an upgrade may be within reason.  Anything older than that will likely be a waste of money to upgrade.</P>

The following are some good guide lines for Windows PC owners:

<UL>
<LI>You should be using, at minimum, a modem speed of 14.4, and a modem speed of 28.8 is ideal.
<LI>Between 20mb and 50mb of additional hard disk space will be needed to use the Internet
<LI>A minimum of 8MB of RAM with virtual memory, 16MB recommended
<LI>You must have a VGA or better monitor (color preferred).
<LI>Windows PC CPU speed: 486 or faster is fine, 386 is minimal and slow, 286 or older forget it
</UL>

Apple states the following requirements for using the Internet:

<UL>
<LI>An Apple Macintosh, Power Macintosh, PowerBook, or other Mac OS-based computer 
<LI>Minimum 8MB of RAM with virtual memory, 12MB recommended 
<LI>Macintosh system software version 7.5 or later 
<LI>A 9,600-bps (or faster) modem (14,400 bps recommended) or a connection to a local area network that is already connected to the Internet 
<LI>A minimum of 21MB of available hard disk space 
<LI>A high-density floppy disk drive or CD-ROM drive
</UL>

<P><B>Adding more RAM is probably a given.</B></P>

<P>Adding more RAM can be frustrating.  Most computers have the ability to accept enough RAM, but many will have used all their available slots with smaller chunks of RAM.  This means you have to through away existing small chunks to make room for larger ones.  The frustrating reality is that you will probably end up replacing all of your RAM to get twice what is currently installed.</P>

<P>Before upgrading, consider their cost compared to buying a new computer.  Upgrading will delay purchasing a new computer for a year, maybe two.  Remember to include the cost of paying someone to install your upgrades.</P>

<H1>Software Requirements for Accessing the Internet</H1>

There are three components required for getting connected to the Internet:
<UL>
<LI>An Internet Access provider (ISP) service
<LI>The correct computer hardware, including modem
<LI>Software for dial up connection, browsing the Web, and exchanging electronic mail
</UL>

<P>Once you have the hardware set up and have located an Internet access provider, you will need to install software.  This document talks about the software you will need to dial up a connection and then navigate the Internet.</P>

<P>The dial up software manages the account information you have established with an Internet access provider.  It keeps track of the number you must dial, what your confidential pass word and user identification is, and a bunch of other technical detail you don’t even want to try and understand.  </P>

<P>The dial up component of your software package is usually configured with the help of your Internet access provider.  Once you have the dial up software installed, call your access provider.  Your access provider will walk you through the configuration of your dial up software.  In some cases, your Internet access provider will supply the software required for dialing up a connection to the Internet.  In this case the software will already be configured for your Internet access provider account, or any configuration you do will be fairly simple.</P>

<P>Your Internet access provider may also supply you with the other software packages needed to navigate the Internet and exchange electronic mail.  The software solutions offered by access providers are varied and often more complicated than the average person wants to deal with.</P>

<P>A simple way to get all the required software installed and configured is to purchase one of the integrated packages.  These packages include everything you need for dialing up, browsing the World Wide Web and exchanging electronic mail.  We have found these packages make the entire process quick and easy.  You simply install the package and then call you Internet access provider for help in configuring the dial up and electronic mail components.  The whole process takes about thirty minutes.  These packages will even suggest an Internet access provider, but often they are the more expensive U.S. and Canada national providers.</P>

We have identified three integrated software packages:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#Netscape">Netscape Navigator Personal Edition for Microsoft Windows or Macintosh</A>
<LI><A HREF="#Apple">Apple Internet Connection Kit for Macintosh</A>
<LI><A HREF="#Microsoft">Microsoft Internet Explorer Starter Kit for Microsoft Windows or Macintosh</A>
</UL>


<H3><A NAME="Netscape">Netscape Navigator Personal Edition</A></H3>

This package can be purchased from most software vendors.  A good U.S. national software vendor is Egghead Software at 1-800-EGGHEAD (1-800-344-4323)

Outside the U.S. try one of the <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/netscape_partner_programs/ordering/index.html">Worldwide Distributors</A>, or  <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/ja/distrib_en.html">Japanese Distributors</A> listed on the attached pages.  If there is no distributor listed in your area, you can place an order by calling +1 415/937-2555.  In Europe try  +33 01.41.97.55.44 (toll call) Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 7 p.m. GMT+1.

<P>You can find out more from their Web site at <A HREF="http://merchant.netscape.com/netstore/NAVIGATORS/PE/PE_ITEMS/leaf/product1.html">http://merchant.netscape.com/netstore/NAVIGATORS/PE/PE_ITEMS/leaf/product1.html</A></P>

<H3><A NAME="Apple">Apple Internet Connection Kit</A></H3>

This package must be purchased from an apple authorized dealer or reseller.  Here are some numbers to call in locating a dealer or reseller:
<UL>
<LI>U.S. Dealer/Reseller Referral.(800) 538-9696
<LI>Canada Reseller.(800) 665-2775
<LI>European Reseller.(33) 1-49-01-4901
<LI>Japan Apple Reseller. (81) 3-54-11-8500
</UL>

Ask for Order No. 416000U

<P>You can find out more from their Web site at <A HREF="http://product.info.apple.com/productinfo/datasheets/as/iconkit1.1.html">http://product.info.apple.com/productinfo/datasheets/as/iconkit1.1.html</A></P>

<H3><A NAME="Microsoft">Internet Explorer Kit</A></H3>

This package must be purchased from a Microsoft authorized dealer or reseller.  Here are some numbers to call in locating a dealer or reseller:
<UL>
<LI>Microsoft Sales and Information Center, U.S.: 1-800-426-9400
<LI>Microsoft European Headquarters, France:  (011)(33) 1-46-35-1010
<LI>Microsoft Asia Pacific Headquarters, Australia: 61 2 870-2200
<LI>Microsoft Latin American Headquarters, Ft. Lauderdale, FL USA: +1-954-489-4800
<LI>Microsoft  United Kingdom: 0345 00 2000
</UL>

<P>Microsoft's numbers for  most countries can be found on their Web site at <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/default.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/default.htm</A></P>

<p>A good U.S. national software vendor is Egghead Software at 1-800-EGGHEAD (1-800-344-4323)</p>

If you are using Microsoft Windows 95 there is one additional option.  Windows 95 has its own Internet starter kit built in.  Just follow these steps:
<OL>
<LI>Select Start in the lower left corner of the screen
<LI>Select Programs
<LI>Select Accessories
<LI>Select Internet Tolls
<LI>Select Get on the Internet and follow the instructions
</OL>

<P>This kit will walk you through getting connected and even suggest an Internet access provider.  It also lets you plug in the configuration for your own Internet access provider.</P>

<P>You can find out more from their Web site at <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/">http://www.microsoft.com/ie/</A></P>

<H3>About Browser software</H3>

<P>One of the most important components of your software package is the World Wide Web browser software.  There are two popular options; Netscape Navigator, and Microsoft Internet Explorer.  In the integrated software packages listed above, Netscape Navigator is the browser offered from Netscape and Apple.  While Microsoft Internet Explorer is offered in the Microsoft Internet Explorer Starter Kit and the starter package included with Windows 95.  Regardless of the integrated package you select, the alternate browser can be installed later.  In fact, you can have both browser packages installed at the same time and switch between them depending on your taste.  </P>

<H3>About Electronic Mail (Email)</H3>

<P>All of the packages mentioned above offer an electronic mail solution that is somewhat limited.  You will want to look at purchasing <A HREF="http://www.eudora.com/">Eudorah</A> for the best electronic mail solution.  This is particularly important if you use electronic mail frequently, or have a high volume of mail to manage.  Eudorah can be found on the World Wide Web, or you can purchase it from a local software vendor such as <A HREF="http://www.egghead.com/">Egghead</A>.</P>

<H3>Purchasing New Or Upgrading Existing Software</H3>

<P>Once you have access to the Internet purchasing, or upgrading, software becomes much easier.  Most popular software vendors are selling their products on the Internet through World Wide Web store fronts.  Most will let you download the product and try it first before paying anything.  In many cases, such as the browser software, there is no charge.  In other cases, they let you download a version of the software that has some features turned off.  This gives you just enough of a package to evaluate it.  When you purchase it, the crippled features are turned on.</P>

<P>With new versions of software coming out as often as every few months, downloading upgrades has become a popular option.  The more popular software developers have made downloading fairly easy to do.  Most offer good, easy to follow, instructions for downloading and installing their products.</P>

<h3>
HOW TO ESTIMATE ANGLES IN THE SKY
</h3>

<hr>

<p>
An angle is a measure of rotation in a circle.  Every circle has 360 degrees.
It doesn't matter how big or how small the circle is.  If you stand in the
center of <i>any</i> circle and turn completely around exactly once, you have
rotated 360 degrees.
</p>

<p>
Astronomers use angles to measure the relative position of objects in the sky,
because the angle between, say, two stars doesn't change and doesn't depend
on how far away each of the stars are.  Strictly speaking, the angle between
two stars can and <i>does</i> change, but for our practical purposes, it
will stay the same, day after day, year after year.
</p>

<p>
To locate an object in the sky at a particular time, astronomers often use
two angles, called the <b>azimuthal angle</b> and the <b>altitudinal angle</b>.
Sometimes, you'll hear astronomers refer to their telescopes as having an
<i>Alt-Az</i> mount.  That phrase refers to these two angles.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<img src="azi.gif" align=left width=367 height=259>     Azimuthal Angle
</h2>

<p>
Imagine yourself standing at the center of this circle and facing North.
This direction corresponds to an azimuthal angle of 0 degrees.  If you
turn and face East, you're looking in the direction that corresponds
to an azimuthal angle of 90 degrees.  If you had turned only halfway
towards East, and faced North-East instead, you would be looking in the
direction that corresponds to an azimuthal angle of 45 degrees.  And so
on around the circle.  South is 180 degrees.  West is 270 degrees.  If
you turn completely around and face North again, you've rotated 360 degrees.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<img src="alt.gif" align=left width=402 height=181>     Altitudinal Angle
</h2>

<p>
The other angle that astronomers use is the altitudinal angle, which
measures angles from the horizon up into the sky.  The horizon (in any
direction) corresponds to an altitudinal angle of 0 degrees.  The point
directly overhead, called the <b>zenith</b>, corresponds to an
altitudinal angle of 90 degrees.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
A pair of these two angles, one azimuthal angle and one altitudinal angle,
can be used to locate any position in the sky.  For example, to look at the
point in the sky that is (Azi=135, Alt=45) first turn and face southeast,
SE (135 deg), then tilt your head back until you're looking halfway up from
the horizon to the zenith, (45 deg).
</p>

<p>
The azimuthal and altitudinal angles of particular stars or planets are
usually not "nice" values like 45 degrees or 90 degrees, which are fairly
easy to estimate.  However, there are a few simple "rules of thumb" you
can learn, to estimate just about any angle you want.  The sections below
show you how.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<img src="moon.gif" align=left width=32 height=32>     0.5 degree
</h2>

<p>
The width of a full Moon, as viewed from the Earth's surface, is about
0.5 degree.<br>
The width of the Sun, as viewed from the Earth's surface, is also about
0.5 degree.
</p>

<h2>
<img src="I-hand.gif" align=left width=30 height=40>     1.5 degrees
</h2>

<p>
Hold your hand at arm's length, and extend your pinky finger.
The width of your pinky finger is about 1.5 degrees.
</p>

<h2>
<img src="F-hand.gif" align=left width=30 height=40>     5 degrees
</h2>

<p>
Hold your hand at arm's length, and extend your middle, ring, and
pinky fingers, with the three fingers touching.  The width of your
three fingers is about 5 degrees.
</p>

<h2>
<img src="S-hand.gif" align=left width=30 height=40>     10 degrees
</h2>

<p>
Hold your hand at arm's length, and make a fist with your thumb tucked
over (or under) your other fingers.  The width of your fist is about
10 degrees.
</p>

<h2>
<img src="Y-hand.gif" align=left width=30 height=40>     20 degrees
</h2>

<p>
Hold your hand at arm's length, and extend your thumb and pinky finger.
The distance between the tip of your thumb and the tip of your pinky
finger is about 20 degrees.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<img src="dipper.gif" align=left width=410 height=215>     The Big Dipper
</h2>

<p>
The Big Dipper, which is part of <i>Ursa Major</i>, is one of the easiest
constellations to find any time of year.  Angles between stars of the
Big Dipper happen to be very close to being multiples of 5 degrees, so
they're a "handy" way to check and calibrate <i>your</i> hand and
<i>your</i> technique for estimating angles in the sky.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
The angle between <b>Dubhe</b> and <b>Merak</b> is about 5 degrees, or
three fingers.
</p>

<p>
The angle between <b>Dubhe</b> and <b>Megrez</b> is about 10 degrees, or
one fist.
</p>

<p>
The angle between <b>Dubhe</b> and <b>Alioth</b> is about 15 degrees, or
one fist plus three fingers.
</p>

<p>
The angle between <b>Dubhe</b> and <b>Alkaid</b> is about 25 degrees, or
one thumb-to-pinkie hand span plus three fingers.
</p>

<p>
Imagine drawing a line from <b>Merak</b> through <b>Dubhe</b> and continuing
on past <b>Dubhe</b> for not quite 30 degrees, or three fists.  (The angle is
actually 28 degrees.)  At that point is <b>Polaris</b>, the <i>north star</i>
about which all other stars in the sky appear to revolve.

<p>
<b>SEPTEMBER 1996</b>
</p>
</a>

<p>
The September 1996 meeting was held on September 13th.  Our speaker
was Dr. Phillip Kelton, Assistant Director of the McDonald Observatory.
He gave us an update on the current inventory and usage of telescopes
at the observatory.  At this time, the 30-inch telescope is a dedicated
imaging system, with a 2048x2048 CCD array.  The 36-inch telescope is
used for photometry, polarimetry, and imaging.  The 60-year-old 82-inch
Otto Struve telescope is being used primarily for spectrometry.  The
107-inch Harlan J. Smith telescope is actively being upgraded, with the
installation of a new guidance and tracking control system that will be
better integrated with the instruments, additional primary mirror supports
and a new active support control system, improvements to the telescope's
thermal environment, and new instruments.  The new Hobby-Eberly telescope
(HET) is expected to see first light in early November, with 85% science
operations achieved by early 1997 and 98% science operations achieved
sometime in 1999.  Phillip also told us a little about the partnership
between McDonald Observatory, E-Systems, Ball Aerospace, and the Austin
airport authorities to bid on the SOFIA project, which will be a 2.5 meter
infrared spectrum telescope mounted in a Boeing 747 aircraft.  He briefly
mentioned the smaller telescopes operated by the observatory, such as the
30-inch laser ranging telescope, 18-inch supernova search telescope, and
the 25-inch Dobsonian and 16-inch Meade that are based at the Visitor's
Center for public star parties.
</p>

<a name="oct96">
<p>
<b>OCTOBER 1996</b>
</p>
</a>

<p>
There was no regular meeting in October, as the second Friday coincided
with the autumn <a href="activity.html#centex">Central Texas Star Party</a>.
</p>

<a name="nov96">
<p>
<b>NOVEMBER 1996</b>
</p>
</a>

<p>
The November 1996 meeting was held on November 8th.  Our speaker was
long-time Society member and satellite guru, <a href="profiles.html#mccants">
Mike McCants</a>.  His topic was <i>Tumbling Satellites</i>.  He discussed
types of satellite angular motions, their origins, and how they can change
over time.  Mike described the satellite observing program of the Belgium
Working Group on Satellites (BWGS) and some of the peculiar behaviors that
have been observed but still are not understood.  Mike also touched on some
of the equipment and techniques he uses to observe satellites.
</p>

<a name="dec96">
<p>
<b>DECEMBER 1996</b>
</p>
</a>

<p>
The December 1996 meeting was held on December 13th.  The program for
this meeting was <i>Show And Tell</i> presented by various members of
the Society.  Ed Stewart led off with a demonstration of a tripod sled
that he designed and built for transporting his Meade LX-200 telescope.
He distributed preprints of an article describing this sled, which is
to be published in the March 1997 issue of <i>Astronomy</i>.  Ed also
showed his slides from the total lunar eclipse that was visible from
Austin this past September.  Following Ed, Kelley Knight gave a brief
presentation about the astronomy tours at Wild Basin, the Land Sea And
Sky store that she visited in Houston, and the astronomy materials that
she has collected over the past couple of years.  Next, Glen Roark, an
avid solar eclipse chaser, read a poem that he wrote about the total
lunar eclipse in September:
<blockquote><i>
When the moon met my eye<br>
Like a big pizza pie,<br>
'Twas an eclipse.<br>
And with Saturn nearby,<br>
Such a feast in the sky<br>
I could not miss.<br><br>
When the clouds kindly rolled away,<br>
And unveiled there a lovely display.<br>
A celestial delight which might<br>
Grace such a wonderful fall night!<br>
</i></blockquote>
Finally, Tom Robichaux presented a collection of slides shot by Larry
Forrest.  These slides included the Rosette Nebula, Pleiades, part of the
Veil Nebula, the Lagoon Nebula, and the Orion Nebula.
</p>

<a name="jan97">
<p>
<b>JANUARY 1997</b>
</p>
</a>

<p>
The January 1997 meeting will be held on January 10th.  Due to the
holidays, the program for this meeting could not be finalized before
the monthly update of this site.

<P>The Austin Skiers club is a social club for snow skiers and sports
enthusiasts. The club membership comes from around Central Texas and
numbers around 400 people from all walks of life. The primary
objective of the club is to promote and encourage individual and
group interest in the sport of snow skiing; this is accomplished
through the sponsorship of a variety of
<A HREF="97skitrt.htm">trips.</A></P>

<P>Our club information line can be reached at: <B>335-3662</B></P>

<P>The Austin Skiers club is a nonprofit organization and is
incorporated under the laws of the State of Texas. We are an
affiliated member of the Texas Ski Council (TSC). The Texas Ski
Council represents over 15,000 skiers throughout Texas. Many of our
trips are booked in conjunction with the Texas Ski Council and you'll
be hard pressed to find a better value for your skiing dollar.</P>

<P>Membership is open to people who are eighteen years of age or
older and their families. Families are certainly welcome! Please see
our <A HREF="memapp.txt">Membership Application.</A></P>

<P>In addition to monthly meetings, weekly happy hours and a whole
range of sports activities, you'll find a group of people that are a
lot of fun! Hope to see you at one of our
<A HREF="skischet.htm">upcoming events!</A><BR>

<P>Our club information line can be reached at: <B>335-3662</B></P>
<P>
<H3>February</H3>
<P><B>Happy hours for February are at El Torito (IH35 and 290)</B>
<P>
<P>Feb. 11      Valentine's Party/Monthly meeting
<P>Join us for a wonderful evening at the Hula Hut at 3826 Lake Austin
Blvd. &#173; next to Lakeview Cafe.  The social hour will be from 7 - 
9PM.  The club will provide hors d'oeuvres.
<P>Feb. 28     Let's all go see the Ice Bats hockey team take on Central 
Texas. At the time of this writing, the Austin Ice Bats are just one
game behind Central Texas &#173; the second place team in the WPHL. This
is the last home game of the season; so don't miss this opportunity. I
have twenty seats reserved at the blue line and can get more if needed.
We will need to be at the Texas Exposition by 7:00 p.m. Please get the
$7 entry fee to Ken Jacquin before Feb. 16th. I will give out the
tickets at the door.
<P>
<H3>March</H3>
<P><B>Happy hours for March are at New West</B>
<P>
<P>Mar. 11      Monthly meeting
<P>Join us for our monthly meeting. Location: TBD. The social hour will
be from 7 - 9PM.  The club will provide hors d'oeuvres.
<P>Mar. 21     Laugh until your cheeks ache at Esther's Follies. 
Esther's has been an Austin comedy tradition for many years. Get your
$12 entry fee to Ken Jacquin by 3/15 to hold a spot. I have 15 seats
reserved and can get more. If 15 or more sign up, we will get $1 off. We
will need to be at Ether's by 7:30 p.m.
<P>
<H3>April</H3>
<P><B>Happy hours for April are at Sorrentos by Highland Mall</B>
<P>
<P>Apr. 26     We're off to the races at Manor Downs for an afternoon of 
great live quarter horse racing (they run much better than dead horses -
seriously, this will make sense when you read the rest of
this announcement). Racing starts at 1:00 p.m. and continues until 6:00
p.m. They will also have simulcast racing from other tracks throughout
the country. You can bet on both the live and simulcast races. We will
have reserved grandstand covered seats for a total cost of approximately
$7. Put this on your calendar.
<P>
<H3>May</H3>
<P><B>Happy hours for May are at the Lodge at Lakeview</B>
<P>
<P>May ??     Spring Campout &#173; stay tuned for more information.



<P><B>Shameless Pleading:<BR>

</B>If you would like to host a bike ride, happy hour, party, golf
outing, bowling party, or pretty much anything else, please call Ken
Jacquin at 345-7997 with your ideas...<B> </B><HR SIZE="4"></P>

<P>     What a great group of Austin Skiers we had on the SLC trip! It
all began, strangely enough, at 5:40 a.m. Saturday morning, December
28th. The plane left Austin a little after 7 a.m. This early start gave
many in the great group time to ski Brighton that same day! Brighton had
excellent night skiing also! WOW!
<P>     Sunday morning we reentered Big Cottonwood Canyon. 
This time we traveled to Solitude. It had snowed the night before. The
light powder on top of the wonderful base gave us another holiday on the
planet!
<P>     Monday morning we journeyed up a different canyon just east of
SLC. At the end of Little Cottonwood Canyon Road is &quot;THE SKIERS
LEGEND&quot; also knows as ALTA. Lift ticket here was only $28.00. What
a deal! What a mountain!
<P>     Tuesday we ventured into SNOWBIRD. This mountain is awesome! The
train ride to the top of this part of the world will be remembered!
Another day in paradise!
<P>     Wednesday - JAN 1st marked our 5th day of skiing! What a way to
start the New Year!
<P>     With so many good, fun-loving people on this trip I now give my
&quot;thanks&quot; to each trip participant and to all the club officers
and directors that made this &quot;experience&quot; possible.
<P>          &quot;LET'S GO AGAIN NEXT YEAR.&quot;
<P>                                   <B><I>Ben Mathis</B></I>

<P>     Join us for the events below. As always I am looking for input 
(and help) for future events. If you have some ideas, let me know. If
you can help with any of these below or would like to run one of your

<P>

have twenty seats reserved at the blue line and can get more if needed.
We will need to be at the Texas Exposition by 7:00 p.m. Please get the
$7 entry fee to Ken Jacquin before Feb. 16th. I will give out the

seriously, this will make sense when you read the rest of
this announcement). Racing starts at 1:00 p.m. and continues until 6:00
p.m. They will also have simulcast racing from other tracks throughout
the country. You can bet on both the live and simulcast races. We will

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>By Ken Jacquin</FONT></B></H4>
<P>     If you missed this New Years Party, you missed another great
party. Approximately 40 Austin Skiers gathered at Terry Champion's house
for this third annual New Year's Party. Everything cooperated to make
this a memorable evening. There was lots of delicious food and enticing
beverages, and great company provided by other skiers. And where else
but Texas could you sit outside on a deck until the wee hours of the
morning on New Years Eve without so much as a sweater. One of the
neighbors even provided a fireworks show; though small, it lasted all
evening.
<P>     Special thanks to Terry for inviting us into this lovely home to
have this party.

Skin Cancer Risk Assessment
<BR></FONT></B></H4> <H4 ALIGN=CENTER><B>
<FONT SIZE=4>American Cancer Society, Texas
Division</FONT></B></H4>
<P>Risk factors are those characteristics that are more frequently found
in persons with a specific cancer than in persons without that cancer.
The following items are risk factors for SKIN CANCER. Answer
&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to each question to access your
personal risk factors for skin cancer.
<P>
<P>     1.     Did you experience a severe, blistering sunburn before
the age of 18?
<P>     2.     Does your job require frequent sun exposure?
<P>     3.     Do you live in the southern United States?
<P>     4.     Do you or have you used tanning beds or sunlamps?
<P>     5.     Do you sunbathe?
<P>     6.     Do you have outdoor recreational hobbies?
<P>     7.     Is your natural hair color blond, red, or light brown?
<P>     8.     Is your natural eye color green, hazel, gray or blue?
<P>     9.     Is your skin freckled and or fair?
<P>     10.     Do you sunburn easily?
<P>     11.     Have you been exposed to creosote, coal pitch tar,
arsenic, lubricating or cutting oils on your job?
<P>     12.     Have you had x-ray treatment to the skin for acne or
another skin condition?
<P>     13.     Have you had a skin cancer in the past?
<P>     14.     Have you ever had a precancerous skin lesion removed or
treated?
<P>     15.     Have any of your family members had a skin cancer?
<P>     16.     Have you had a severe burn to the skin that resulted in
scar formation?
<P>     17.     Were you born with a birthmark larger than 7 inches?
<P>     18.     Do you wear sunscreen less than half the time when
outdoors?
<P>
<P>All &quot;yes&quot; answers are considered to
<P>be risk factors for skin cancer.
<P>You can change many of your risk factors!
<P>
<P>RISK FACTORS FOR SKIN CANCER
<P>
<P>Heavy Lifetime Sun Exposure (Questions 1-6): Repeated overexposure to
the ultraviolet rays of the sun is the principal cause of most skin
cancers. Risk increases for those who are heavily exposed to the sun in
their occupations, including farmers, sailors, and road and construction
workers. Risk also increases for those whose recreational activities
involve heavy sun exposure, such as swimming, skiing, golfing and
jogging. Tanning salons emit ultraviolet radiation which add to the skin
damage caused by the sun, contributing to skin cancer formation. People
who have experienced a severe, blistering burn before the age of 18 are
at increased risk for developing melanoma, the most serious form of skin
cancer.

<P>     o     o
<P>     o     o
<P>     o     o
<P>Skin Pigmentation (Questions 7-10): Fair-skinned people are at
increased risk, especially those with blond, red or light brown hair and
light-colored eyes (blue, gray, hazel or green). Those of Celtic
(Scottish, Irish) descent are at higher risk. Fair-skinned persons are
at greatest risk, although it is important to remember that anyone can
develop skin cancer.
<P>
<P>Exposure to Chemical Carcinogens (Question 11): 
Those with occupational exposure to paraffin waxes, anthracin soot,
lubricating or cutting oils, mineral oils, creosotes, coal pitch tar, or
previous exposure to arsenic are at increased risk. Examples of workers
at occupational risk may include roofers, road repair
workers, insecticide makers or sprayers, coal miners, tar distillers, or
machine operators exposed to lubricating oils.
<P>
<P>History of Superficial X-Ray Treatment (Question 12): 
A history of x-ray treatments for acne, psoriasis, fungal conditions, or
to remove unwanted hair, particularly when in combination with heavy sun
exposure, may increase one's risk of developing skin cancer.
<P>
<P>Personal or Family History of Skin Cancer (Questions 13-15): 
People who have had a previous skin cancer or precancerous lesion are at
increased risk for developing skin cancer. People who have a family
member with melanoma are at increased risk for developing melanoma
themselves.
<P>
<P>Birthmarks and Burn Scars (Questions 16 &amp; 17): 
Persons born with a birthmark larger than seven inches 
(&quot;giant congenital nevus&quot;) are at increased risk for melanoma
formation later in life. A severe burn to the skin due to fire or
chemicals increases risk for developing skin cancer in the scarred skin.
<P>
<P>REDUCING YOUR RISK FOR SKIN CANCER
<P>Cover Up with a wide-brimmed hat, and a bandana for your neck; wear
long-sleeved shirts and pants the sun can't penetrate.
<P>
<P>Use Sunscreens with a Sun Protective Factor (SPF) rating of 15 or
higher. Apply sunscreen at least an hour before going into the sun and
again after swimming or perspiring. Avoid indoor sunlamps or tanning
booths.
<P>
<P>Know the Ways of the Rays you <U>may</U> get burned on a cloudy day.
And the sun's rays can reach down into three feet of water. Avoid the
direct sun at midday, as the sun's rays are strongest between 11 a.m.
and 2 p.m. And beware of high altitudes there is less atmosphere to
filter out the ultraviolet rays. Snow reflects the sun's rays, too.
<P>
<P>KNOW YOUR SKIN
<P>Whatever your skin type, do a monthly self-exam of your skin to note
any moles, blemishes or birthmarks. Check them once a month and if you
notice any changes in size, shape or color or if a sore does not heal,
see your physician without delay.
<P>                                   <B><I>Our Thanks to the American
Cancer Society</B></I>

V.P. Trips</FONT></B></H4></FONT></B></H4>


<P>     As I write this, Snowmass has just gotten back from a wonderful
trip. I saw on the Aspen web site that they had gotten around a foot of
new snow on Sunday/Monday, then Ken Jacquin told me on Sunday that they
had received another major snowfall Thursday night. What a trip to
remember! The Italy trip is departing this week to make a total of over
400 Texas Skiers in Moena, Italy. Taos should be getting back by the
time you read this and should have some excellent skiing. According
to the Taos web page, they got 56 inches of snow from Jan. 10 to Jan. 
14. Purgatory got hit by the same storm and came out with a new snow
total of 54 inches. Jackson Hole has a base depth of over 110 inches
with a total snowfall over 360 inches. Mt Bachelor is still leading the
way with a base of 125 to 163 inches.
<P>     Purgatory Long and Short are currently full but do not have 
anybody on a wait list.
<P>     Jackson Hole is full and taking a wait list. 
Contact Steve Kupec for information.
<P>     Mt Bachelor &#173; The long trip has 6 to 8 spaces still available. 
The short trip if full but Jim is investigating the possibilities of 
expanding it. Talk to Jim Howalt for details.
<P>     All prices listed include round trip air and bus transportation, 
lodging, pre-trip and post-trip parties. Current membership is required
to sign up for a trip. Lift ticket prices are separate for all but the
Italy trip.

<P>     Two years ago in March, Austin Skiers made their first trip to
Mt. Bachelor, Oregon with the Texas Ski Council. With 5-6 inches of new
snow every day that week plus a great ski mountain, we had a great week 
and everyone was anxious to return. Mt. Bachelor is a large dormant
volcanic mountain located in the center of Oregon close to the city of
Bend. While it is not so well known, especially in Texas, I think it is
one of the best ski mountains in the country.
<P>     Mt. Bachelor boasts over 300 inches average snowfall, 3,100 feet 
of vertical drop, 60 runs, 3,600 acres of skiing accessibility by lift, 
1,600 acres of this groomed daily, and 11 chair lifts. It has long been
a leader with the latest technology, and in 1996/7 will have 7 high
speed quad lifts in operation. Lift lines are not a problem at Mt.
Bachelor. The newest lift is being installed this summer and will carry
skiers up 2 miles and 2,100 vertical feet. This lift opens a new area on
the mountain directed primarily to the more advanced skiers. Overall,
Bachelor has a great variety with excellent ski runs for all levels. The
breakdown is 15% beginner, 25% intermediate, 35% advanced/intermediate,
and 25% expert. The high speed quad lifts serve all these areas very
well. For those who area interested, snow boarders are welcome, and
there is an excellent cross country ski area right at the base of the
mountain. This area has 12 trails varying from 1 to 10 miles.
<P>     We will fly to Portland via Phoenix and then bus into the resort 
city of Sun River which is about 15 miles from the ski mountain. We will
be staying in 2 bedroom/2 bath condos at the Sun River Resort. There is 
a shopping mall within walking distance of our condos which also has a
number of good restaurants, grocery store, etc. The city of Bend is
about 10 miles away and is a resort type community with a number of good
restaurants. On our last trip, transportation to/from the mountain was
somewhat difficult, so this year we are chartering our own 48 passenger
bus for the week. This will make 2 round trips to the mountain in
the morning and in the afternoon, and will also be available in the
evening for trips into Bend. Trip size is 42 long and 12 short. Lifts
are $30/day. We still have openings for both short and long. Contact Jim
or Ellen for information.
<P>                                   <B><I>Kent</B></I>

<P>     The Austin Skiers kicked off the 1996-97 season at Keystone,
Colorado for Thanksgiving. The trip was a blast. The Pines Condos once
again provided our 43 skiers and one snowboarder with a spectacular view
of the Rockies. Keystone Resort is fast developing a well deserved
reputation for feeding us as well as (if not better than) we would be at
home with Mom for the holiday. The Welcome Buffet Party, Thanksgiving
Dinner, Post Race Picnic Luncheon and Awards Banquet left us all with
calories to burn and burn 'em we did!
<P>     Never ever skier Kerry Grubanowitch and <U>almost</U> never ever
skier Renee Pollsen were looking very confident in the gorgeous weather
and excellent early snow conditions. Our able and fearless leader Neil
Martin did a terrific job keeping us out of serious trouble despite the
best efforts of fun lovin' Flo Schubert and Laila Asmar.
<P>     Thanks to the wiley coaching of Tere Ayson, we made a pretty
fair showing in the club races on Friday, especially considering we're
nothing but a bunch of charming and sophisticated urbanites. Alex
Nedleman, modest Mike Regan, George Gillar and Gabe Ayson collected
silver medals for their efforts while Jim Howalt and Jack Hall grabbed
bronze medals. In the individual races the following day, we fared
even better as Gabe Ayson, George Gillar and painfully modest Mike Regan 
earned gold medals. Silver medals were awarded to Jim Howalt and Alex
Nedleman while Melanie Eskoff stole off with a bronze.
<P>     Serious casualties were avoided for the most part &#173; oh, yes
&#173; <U>excepting</U> for Carolyn Hall's run-in (metaphorically
speaking) with far too many schnapps spiked hot chocolates and John
Gillum's unfortunate run-in (literally) with a gully at the bottom of
Wild Irishman.
<P>     Everyone did have a roaring great time, though and with the help
of some unusual distractions &#173; like three trips past the Denver air
terminal by our disoriented bus driver and the madcap antics of a roving
magician in the terminal &#173; the journey home was a quick and
painless one.
<P>     Thanks to all who participated!
<P>                                   <B><I>Melanie & John</B></I>

<P>ALP  One of a number of ski mountains in Europe. Also a shouted 
request for assistance made by a European skier on a U.S. mountain. An
appropriate reply:  &quot;What Zermatter?&quot;
<P>AVALANCHE  One of the few actual perils skiers face that 
needlessly frighten timid individuals away from the sport. See also:
Blizzard, Fracture, Frostbite, Hypothermia, Lift Collapse.
<P>BINDINGS  Automatic mechanisms that protect skiers from potentially 
serious injury during a fall by releasing skis from boots, sending the
skis skittering across the slope where they trip two other skiers, and
so on and on, eventually causing the entire slope to be protected from
serious injury.
<P>BONES  There are 206 in the human body. No need for dismay, 
however: TWO bones of the middle ear have never been broken in a skiing
accident.
<P>CROSS-COUNTRY SKIING  Traditional Scandinavian all-terrain snow-travelling 
technique. It's good exercise. It doesn't require the purchase of costly
lift tickets. It has no crowds or lines. It isn't skiing.
See Cross-Country Something-Or-Other.
<P>CROSS-COUNTRY SOMETHING-OR-OTHER  Touring on skis along trails 
in scenic wilderness, gliding through snow-hushed woods far from the
hubbub of the ski slopes, hearing nothing but the whispery hiss of the
skis slipping through snow and the muffled tinkle of car keys dropping
into the puffy powder of a deep, wind-sculpted drift.

<P>     What a great year for snow!!! Last year at this time several ski
resorts across the US were unable to open due to the scarce snowfall
amounts. If you have been checking the weather channel or snow reports
on the internet you have noticed the abundance of snowfall all across
the nation and even in Europe. It has even snowed in Austin at least
twice. Yes, this is a great year to ski. You couldn't ask for better
snow, just ask those fortunate enough to ski Keystone over Thanksgiving
and Salt Lake City during New Year's.
<P>     The <U>T</U>exas <U>S</U>ki <U>C</U>ouncil held its Delegates 
meeting in Houston on December 14. I attended along with Kent Wick and
John Pierce. Here is the latest on the TSC trips. Our club placed third
for our Division in the Nastar races during the TSC Fall Roundup trip to
Keystone. The TSC Traditional trip to Snowmass, January 4-11, will have
close to 740 Texans going; 44 of which are from our club. The TSC
Expedition trip to Italy will have 13 clubs represented with over 410
participants, 94 of whom are Austin Skiers. The TSC trip to Purgatory
will have over 270 participants with Austin Skiers taking about 40, and
by the way, our club will be the second club to race Nastar, yea!
<P>     We also heard from a travel operator who reported on how several
Austrian resorts are leading the way in a new technology that will
eliminate the standard lift ticket and the turn style contraption slot
you feed your ticket into. Now you can wear a pre-paid, preprogrammed
watch (Swatch) on your wrist under your jacket sleeve or place a
magnetic card in your parka pocket and as you ski up to the turn style 
it will open automatically with no effort on your part. The system is 
not in place at any of the resorts we are going to this year, but
eventually this technology will spread to other resorts in Europe and
the States. In fact, similar systems are planned for Snowbird, Utah and
Mt. Bachelor, Oregon. And speaking of improvements, Heavenly Valley in
lake Tahoe will be building a gondola that will pick up skiers from the
center of town near the Embassy Suites hotel. The improvements will not
be finished until the year 2000 but it's something to look forward to.
<P>     The Texas Ski Council bid meeting will be held in San Antonio at
the Holiday Inn Riverwalk, April 5 &amp; 6. This is the meeting when
resorts from all over the country come together to present their bids
for the 1997-98 TSC trips. (The New Zealand trip bid for the Summer of
'98 will be presented during this same meeting.) Last year we had close
to 20 Austin Skiers attend the bid meeting, and believe me a good time
was had by all. The cost is $35 per person which includes lunch
Saturday, the party Saturday night and Sunday morning coffee and sweet
rolls. Hotel rooms cost $109 <U>per room</U>, up to 4 people. You do not
need to stay the night, in fact several people came to the meeting on
Saturday and left after the party that night. However, the final vote on
the resorts occurs on Sunday morning. If you are interested in attending
or if you need more information call me at 836-1661 hm or 928-1144 wk.
The more Austin Skiers we have in attendance the merrier.
<P>     And finally, for those of you interested in getting more active
in our volunteer organization, Anthony Beissner will be chairing the
Austin Skiers nominating committee to identify potential officers for
the 1997-98 fiscal year, June 1 through May 31. Give me or Anthony a
call if you are interested.
<P>     And as another year comes to an end, best wishes for a safe and
snow filled ski vacation.
<P>     Happy New Year,
<P>                                   <B><I>Jackie</B></I>

<P>     What I want to know is who has been praying so hard for snow. I
realize that we want the snow but for it to be snowing here in Austin on
December 16th is starting to go a little overboard. Please, tell 'em to
put the snow back in the mountains and we promise to come visit it!
<P>     I have been watching the snow reports from the Internet sites on 
a regular basis and it appears that 1996-1997 will be an excellent year
for snow base build-up. All of the areas that we will be skiing have 
been getting snow during December (for instance, Purgatory is having its
second best snow depth year ever). All of the Aspen mountains opened up
this past weekend. I am hearing that the Alps are covered in snow. Taos
has been getting snow on a regular basis as has Jackson Hole. Mt 
Bachelor is already reporting a 108&quot; to 138&quot; base which should
result in a great end of season trip.
<P>     Salt Lake City has gone and come back by the time you read this.
<P>     Snowmass is full and is taking a wait list. 
Contact Ken Jacquin for more information.
<P>     Val di Fassa, Italy is full but does not have a wait list at 
this time (Dec. 16). Call Greg Bryant if you can go to Europe at the 
last minute.
<P>     Taos has been cut back to a total of 13 air seats. Two of those 
are available (preferably a combination where those two people will be
sharing one room). Call Donna Connell for availability.
<P>     Purgatory Long and Short are currently full but do not have anybody 
on a wait list.
<P>     Jackson Hole has 3 spots open, contact Steve Kupec.
<P>     Mt Bachelor &#173; The long trip has 6 to 8 spaces still available. 
The short trip is full but Jim is investigating the possibilities of 
expanding it. Talk to Jim Howalt for details.
<P>     All prices listed include round trip air and bus transportation, 
lodging, pre-trip and post-trip parties. Current membership is required
to sign up for a trip. Lift ticket prices are separate for all but the
Italy trip.
<P>     As many of you know, the Austin airport is really starting to 
burst at the seams. What with the airlines wanting a photo ID to match
the name on the ticket plus the amount of luggage that ski trips seem to
generate, it takes some time to get everybody checked in and through the
metal detector. The length of time this process takes is one of the
reasons that we ask that trip participants make it to the airport early.
This also saves the amount of hair that the trip chair starts the trip
with.

<P><B>Mt. Bachelor, Oregon
<P>March 8 - 15, 1997  &#173;  $598          March 8 - 12, 1997  &#173;  $490
<P>Trip Chair: Jim Howalt  331-8117        Assistant Chair: Ellen Zimmerman</B>
<P>     Two years ago in March, Austin Skiers made their first trip to Mt. Bachelor, Oregon with the Texas Ski Council. With 5-6 inches of new
 snow every day that week plus a great ski mountain, we had a great week and everyone was anxious to return. Mt. Bachelor is a large dormant
 volcanic mountain located in the center of Oregon close to the city of Bend. While it is not so well known, especially in Texas, I think it is one
 of the best ski mountains in the country.
<P>     Mt. Bachelor boasts over 300 inches average snowfall, 3,100 feet of vertical drop, 60 runs, 3,600 acres of skiing accessibility by lift, 1,600
 acres of this groomed daily, and 11 chair lifts. It has long been a leader with the latest technology, and in 1996/7 will have 7 high speed quad
 lifts in operation. Lift lines are not a problem at Mt. Bachelor. The newest lift is being installed this summer and will carry skiers up 2 miles and
 2,100 vertical feet. This lift opens a new area on the mountain directed primarily to the more advanced skiers. Overall, Bachelor has a great
 variety with excellent ski runs for all levels. The breakdown is 15% beginner, 25% intermediate, 35% advanced/intermediate, and 25% expert.
 The high speed quad lifts serve all these areas very well. For those who area interested, snow boarders are welcome, and there is an excellent
 cross country ski area right at the base of the mountain. This area has 12 trails varying from 1 to 10 miles.
<P>     We will fly to Portland via Phoenix and then bus into the resort city of Sun River which is about 15 miles from the ski mountain. We will
 be staying in 2 bedroom/2 bath condos at the Sun River Resort. There is a shopping mall within walking distance of our condos which also has
 a number of good restaurants, grocery store, etc. The city of Bend is about 10 miles away and is a resort type community with a number of good
 restaurants. On our last trip, transportation to/from the mountain was somewhat difficult, so this year we are chartering our own 48 passenger
 bus for the week. This will make 2 round trips to the mountain in the morning and in the afternoon, and will also be available in the evening
 for trips into Bend. Trip size is 42 long and 12 short. Lifts are $30/day. We still have openings for both short and long. Contact Jim or Ellen for
 information.

<P>     After poor snow during the first part of last year for southern
Colorado and northern New Mexico, Old Man Winter decided to make up for
it this year with enough snow to enable several resorts to open one to
two weeks before Thanksgiving. As of November 21st, Taos already has a
base of 35 inches. Although Taos ranks as one of the best areas around
for the hard core skier, there is enough diverse terrain that beginners
and intermediates can always find plenty of runs to suit their ability.
We still have openings on the Taos trip but will have to make decisions
on trip size at the end of the December meeting. The level of interest
you show before that date will help us decide what should be the final
size. Sign up today! Call Donna Connell at 834-6460 (or Kent Wick (VP
Trips) at 835-1522) to get a trip application form.
<P>     Purgatory is starting one of its best seasons ever and has 
already opened the entire front side of the mountain (expert terrain
included) with a base of 38 inches. During the weekend of Nov 16-17,
they received 26 inches of new snow. The week long trip still has room
for one more person. The short trip is only half full at this time. Both
trips have one of the best air schedules this year with only one stop in
Dallas before flying directly into Durango. With at least two of the
Texas Ski Council activities to be held in our hotel, this is shaping up
to be a great trip. We will have to make trip size adjustments soon so
don't wait around until the last minute.
<P>     We have to make these decisions now because the club must make
payments for the airlines and lodging several weeks prior to the actual
trip departure date.
<P>     The Italy trip does not have a wait list at time of writing this
article (Late November). Contact Greg Bryant to get your name on list to
be first in line for spots that open up.

<P>1.     Make all your payments on time.
<P>2.     Read your newsletter and mailings from your Trip Leader.
<P>3.     Show up at the airport at the time you have been told to show up.
 Don't make the trip leader frantic before leaving Austin.
<P>4.     Bring any documentation required (for example, your passport).
<P>5.     Don't wander off in the airport during layovers.
<P>6.     Pack only the amount of luggage the Trip Leader has told you the
 airlines and bus will accept.
<P>7.     If you don't understand something, ask. Then listen to the answer.
<P>8.     Flip a coin with your roommates for the &quot;master bedroom.&quot; Don't
 just rush in and take it.
<P>9.     Treat your condo mates like family don't expect them to do all the
 cooking and clean up.
<P>10.     Offer to share the grocery bill and your goodies. Don't drink your
 condo mates' beer without asking or paying for it.
<P>11.     On the day of departure, show up at the bus on time. No one likes to
 wait for that &quot;last minute&quot; person.
<P>12.     Realize that your Trip Leader(s) are doing their very best to make
 your trip a good one. Don't be &quot;nit-picky.&quot;
<P>13.     Act like an adult and look after yourself.
<P>14.     Above all, have fun! Introduce yourself to all new members and make
 them feel part of the group. Ski with them. Party with them. Remember
that you were once a new member and didn't know anyone.
<P>                                   <B><I>John Pierce</B></I>

<P>     Austin Skiers is considering forming an Explorer post, with an interest area of snow skiing. 
And we want your opinion.
<P>     Explorer posts are groups of young men and women, aged 14 
through 20, that share a common interest. They meet a couple of times a
month, and generally have one or two special events during the year. The
Austin Skiers Explorer post most likely will organize a skiing trip for
its members.
<P>     The advantages for the young people that join an Explorer post are 
many. Among other benefits, they get to meet people with
similar interests and share information about those interests. And
because each post is run by its members, they gain valuable leadership
experience.
<P>     By helping form an Explorer post, Austin Skiers will help 
foster one of the goals of our organization: promotion of skiing and
other ski sports. We will also introduce a new generation of people to
the fun of attending a ski trip with a group of your friends. We also
hope that as the members of the Explorer post mature, they will be
interested in joining Austin Skiers.
<P>     What we need from you, our members, are your comments. 
Do you agree that this is a worthwhile endeavor? Are you interested in
helping out? We do need sponsors that are willing to volunteer their
time as advisors to the post. Please let Jackie (836-1661) or Anthony 
(346-9852) know what you think, or if you are interested in helping out.
<P>     Thanks!

<P>Happy Hours for December are at Palmeras (290 &amp; IH 35)
<P>
<P>Dec. 14     We will be doing a bike ride at Dripping Springs. This will be a 9:00 a.m. ride of 10-18 miles on a
 beautiful country road that runs parallel to and criss-crosses Onion Creek. We did this ride in July and
 everyone loved it. Everyone should meet at the Dripping Springs school that is just off highway 290
 across from the Shamrock station as you come into Dripping Springs from Austin. Jim Davis, who is
 hosting this ride, will be there by 8:30 with coffee and donuts. The ride will depart at 9:00 a.m. After
 the ride, we will go for breakfast at a nearby restaurant. Contact Jim at home at 892-6797 or at work at
 272-1217 to let him know you are coming.
<P>
<P>Dec. 31     We will have a NEW YEARS Evening Party to end this year and kick off 1997. Terry Champion will
 host this party which will start at 8:00 p.m. and go until ??. Plan to bring your own drinks, a game to
 play, your favorite CD, and an appetizer to share with the rest of the party animals. Please call Terry to

Renaissance Fest<BR></FONT></B></H4>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>By Ken Jacquin</FONT></B></H4>
<P>     On this perfect sun shining, mid-seventies October day,
forty-two Austin Skiers stepped back in time to visit this Medieval
fantasy land. Our day was spent watching all of the different shows, and
wandering the grounds looking at the different shops and at people in
elaborate costumes. People really get into this; there were many very
elaborate costumes, some worn by other attendees. It was great
entertainment causing the day to go by too quickly. The Ded Bob show is
a not-to-miss show; it was so good, Carter Rowles went twice. Also among
the not-to-miss is the Raptor show, the Flaming Idiots show, and the
grand parade.
<P>     On the bus ride over there, our treasurer, Barbara Jacquin
showed everyone her agility and balance. She and Cathy Collins were
serving goodies with Barb facing backwards in the aisle holding a full
glass of orange juice in each hand when the bus driver noticed he was
about to run a stop sign and stomped on the brake. Barb, while being
thrown forward, did a one-eighty and regained her balance while only
losing about twenty percent of the juice from one of the cups. I have
actually seen her attempt similar turns while snow skiing; it was
probably this practice on the mountain that made this recovery possible.
<P>     Special thanks to Cathy Collins for her assistance in bringing
and serving all the drinks and goodies. She did a great job!

The Halloween Party that ROCKED!!!<BR></FONT></B></H4>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>By Ken Jacquin</FONT></B></H4>
<P>     If you missed the Halloween party, you really missed
 out! This was the party of the year; it rocked until the
 wee hours of the morning. There were large tables of deli
cious food and ice chests full of cold beverages. In atten
dance were a large cast of exciting people. We had the
 magical Merlin, our gracious hostess, and her entourage
 of beauties that brought the party to life; the voluptuous
 Gabe-riella with her escort; the provocative Madonna
 with her newborn in matching flashing attire; a dancer
 enshrouded in seven veils who twirled and twirled and
 well you missed that too. We had a bar maid, a waiter,
 waitresses, a pirate, a crash dummy, Indians, hunters, danc
ing penguins, hippies, yuppies, vampires, skeletons, a
 witch, a gorilla, and even others that fail my memory it
 must have been the food I ate. To have a bad time at this
 party, you had to be trying.
<P>     Special thanks to Mary Gasal and her family for invit
ing us into their lovely home for this party. I, along with
 everyone else at the party agreed that the magical Merlin
 and her entourage must come to all of our future parties.
<P>                                   <B><I>Ken Jacquin</B></I>

<P>     DON'T PUT IT OFF 'TILL THE LAST MINUTE! Sign up for that winter
vacation now. We still have openings on some trips but the time is fast
approaching when we will have to cut back on the number of seats for 
some of the trips that are not currently full. Taos, Purgatory (long and
short) and Mt Bachelor (long and short) still have space available.
Snowmass, Val di Fassa and Jackson Hole have short wait lists at this
time so if you are still interested in those trips, give the trip chair

interest (phone calls, etc) shown in the trip.
<P>     All prices listed include round trip air and bus transportation, 
lodging, pre-trip and post-trip parties. Current membership is required

northern Italy's spectacular Dolomite mountains, a winter wonderland
that combines local hospitality with 464 lifts, 750 miles of
groomed trails, and countless interconnected ski areas, all included in
the 6-day ski pass.  Optional day-trips to Cortina, Val Gardena, Venice,
Verona and Innsbruck are available.  Staying in Moena, a quaint mountain
town dating to the 1100's, we're taking over the new  3 Star+ Hotel

<P>
<P>Taos, New Mexico
<P>January 29 - February 1, 1997 &#173; $465
<P>Trip Chair: Donna Connell 834-6460
<P>     We will be adjusting the size of this trip immediately after the 
December meeting! As of Nov 18th, Taos had a 35&quot; base (they had
received 18&quot; of snow over the 16th &amp; 17th). Forty years ago,
what others saw as a mountain too steep to ski, was Ernie Blake's vision
of a ski purist's paradise. Today, Taos Ski Valley is the world-class
resort Ernie envisioned. Skiers who visit Taos will find that they are
rewarded with deep, desert-dry powder, New Mexico sunshine and terrain
to delight skiers of all abilities. It's a magical place, steeped with
charm and Southwestern-European character; a place where the simple
pleasures of classic skiing and personal service prevail. The Ski Valley
has a peak elevation of 11,819'. Slopes for any range of ability; 37%
expert, 18% intermediate and 17% beginner. Taos is also one of 4 major
ski areas that does not allow snowboarding. So bring your skis only!
The Austin Skiers will be traveling to Taos on January 29th, 1997 and
will be returning on February 2nd. Basic trip information: includes RT
air (Continental), ground transportation, 4 nights lodging
w/full breakfast daily, and pre/post trip parties. 3-day lift tickets -

We will be flying on American directly into Durango, a true wild-west
town. The Strater hotel, built in 1887, will be our home in downtown
Durango, providing easy access to shopping and restaurants. Each room
 is uniquely decorated with beautiful antiques. Free shuttle busses will 
provide transportation to the mountain and to the TSC activities held
 elsewhere. Purgatory also has the unique &quot;Total Ticket&quot;

<P>Trip Chair:  Steve Kupec 258-7322
<P>Asst. Chair:  Angie Coleman 892-7699
<P>     Ski Jackson Hole!  To borrow the Wyoming state motto, it is 
&quot;like no place on earth!&quot;  Join the club on an action packed 
adventure to the Grand Tetons of Wyoming.  We'll fly Delta to
Jackson through Salt Lake on our way to the Lodge at Jackson Hole, which
is in town and a short complimentary bus trip to both the ski resort and
the airport.  Each room at the lodge accommodates two people and has
access to spas, saunas and an in/outdoor pool.  Excitement abounds amid
the splendor of one of the finest national treasures: XC skiing,
snowmobiling and wildlife tours.  This trip is currently full and taking
a wait list, but wait lists have been known to disappear before. The
separate 5-day lift ticket will cost $190. Contact Steve or Angie for
information on space availability.
<P>
<P>Mt. Bachelor, Oregon
<P>March 8 - 15, 1997  &#173;  $598          March 8 - 12, 1997  &#173;  $490
<P>Trip Chair: Jim Howalt  331-8117        Assistant Chair: Ellen Zimmerman
<P>     Two years ago in March, Austin Skiers made their first trip to 
Mt. Bachelor, Oregon with the Texas Ski Council. With 5-6 inches of new
snow every day that week plus a great ski mountain, we had a great week 
and everyone was anxious to return. Mt. Bachelor is a large dormant
volcanic mountain located in the center of Oregon close to the city of
Bend. While it is not so well known, especially in Texas, I think it is
one of the best ski mountains in the country.
<P>     Mt. Bachelor boasts over 300 inches average snowfall, 3,100 feet 
of vertical drop, 60 runs, 3,600 acres of skiing accessibility by lift, 
1,600 acres of this groomed daily, and 11 chair lifts. It has long been
a leader with the latest technology, and in 1996/7 will have 7 high
speed quad lifts in operation. Lift lines are not a problem at Mt.
Bachelor. The newest lift is being installed this summer and will carry
skiers up 2 miles and 2,100 vertical feet. This lift opens a new area on
the mountain directed primarily to the more advanced skiers. Overall,
Bachelor has a great variety with excellent ski runs for all levels. The
breakdown is 15% beginner, 25% intermediate, 35% advanced/intermediate,
and 25% expert. The high speed quad lifts serve all these areas very
well. For those who area interested, snow boarders are welcome, and
there is an excellent cross country ski area right at the base of the
mountain. This area has 12 trails varying from 1 to 10 miles.
<P>     We will fly to Portland via Phoenix and then bus into the 
resort city of Sun River which is about 15 miles from the ski mountain. 
We will be staying in 2 bedroom/2 bath condos at the Sun River Resort.
There is a shopping mall within walking distance of our condos which
also has a number of good restaurants, grocery store, etc. The city of
Bend is about 10 miles away and is a resort type community with a number
of good restaurants. On our last trip, transportation to/from the
mountain was somewhat difficult, so this year we are chartering our own
48 passenger bus for the week. This will make 2 round trips to the
mountain in the morning and in the afternoon, and will also be available
in the evening for trips into Bend. Trip size is 42 long and 12 short.
Lifts are $30/day. We still have openings for both short and long.
Contact Jim or Ellen for information.

<P>     Our first ski trip of the season is only 4 weeks away. If you
haven't started your ski conditioning exercises yet - you had better
start soon to get as much as possible from your trip(s) and to avoid
skiing related injuries.  If you are like me, just carrying your
ski equipment can mess you up if you are not in condition.  One trip, I
spent the whole week not being able to turn my head to the left because
I pulled a muscle in my left shoulder and neck while carrying my ski bag
to my room.  Your skiing gets limited (and dangerous) when you can only
make right turns.  
<P>     And since we have so many of our ski trips coming up quickly,
this is a good time to shop for the latest ski wear and equipment.  One
can never have too many ski jackets - isn't that right dear?  Thinking
about a new pair of parabolic skis?  Many of the local ski/sports shops
are offering special discounts just to our members.  (Yes, there
is more to being an Austin Skier's member than free greasy buffalo wings
served at our monthly meetings.)  <B>Sail n Ski </B>kicked off the ski
season's shopping by hosting an Austin Skier's happy hour at their 
store on October 24.  We saw many of you there taking advantage of the
15% discount they offered that evening.
<P>     This month <B>Sun &amp; Ski</B> (across from Northcross Mall)
will sponsor our November meeting.  (November 12) and will feature a
fashion show and discounts for members.  And since their ski deck is up
and running, maybe we can get in a few practice runs.  Don't miss this
entertaining, informative and if the ski deck works &#173; hilarious
meeting!
<P>     And last of all, <B>Oshmans</B> has provided coupons to
 our members.  The coupon is good for 20% off of a onetime skiing
related purchase.  It expires on November 23, so if you
aren't able to pick up a coupon at one of our happy hours, call me at
836-1661 to make arrangements to receive yours.
<P>     As we mentioned in last month's newsletter, Austin Skiers will
be conducting a photo contest featuring winning shots from this year's
club ski trips.  Keep the contest in mind as you set up your photo
opportunities during the Texas Ski Council, Fall Roundup trip to
Keystone.
<P>     For those of you lucky enough to kick off the ski season by
skiing all day and eating your turkey too, best wishes for a safe,
snow-filled ski trip.  And when you return with a full case of incurable
ski fever call Kent Wick for an update on the available space on our
other trips.

<P>     It was a beautiful day...
<P>     On September 8th, sixteen talented Austin Skiers made short work 
of the Lions Municipal golf course.  Well, almost.  We definitely had a
few people that could play the game &#173; and a few people who carried
clubs around (guess which group I belong to).  But in all, it was
another successful Skiers' tournament.
<P>     If you haven't tried one of our semiannual outings, you're missing 
out on a lot of fun.  The tournament format is a 4-person scramble. 
What this means is that each person takes their shot in turn and the
best shot of the foursome is used.  On the next shot, each person moves
their ball to the aforementioned &quot;best position&quot; and away you
go.  This of course assumes that someone in your foursome can hit a
decent shot.  If not, you can always use one of the following excuses:
<P>     &#183;  The sun got in my eyes (good excuse, since it was overcast 
that day)
<P>     &#183;  My partner made a noise (razzing participants is encouraged)
<P>     &#183;  These clubs are junk! (just like poor ski equipment, right?)
<P>     &#183;  Man! I'm just off my game today. (sure...)
<P>     At any rate, we did have a few Skiers that excelled in their 
performance.  The lowest score was shot by &quot;Team 1&quot; which
consisted of Jerry Sexton, Jim Patterson, Sharon Hogue and Charlie 
Hogue. By the way, I have noticed that in each of the past three
tournaments, Jerry Sexton is ALWAYS on the winning team - Guess I know
which team to pick in the next tournament. The &quot;closest to the
pin&quot; trophy went to Dale Young.  I'm pretty sure he didn't kick the
ball, but I was looking the other way... And the longest drive went to
Otis Sikes.  What a beast!     Awesome!     Looong drive!
<P>     Team 2, (Charles Gordon, Emory Douglas, Janice Kaczmarek and George 
Dawkins) were looking *very* good.  I'm surprised they didn't come up
with the win.  My team had Dale, Wendy Buck, Gabe and Tere Ayson
(beer cart duties, don't you know) we didn't have any wonderful shots,
but had a lot of laughs.  And bringing up the rear was Martin DeStefano,
Otis Sikes, Terry Champion (very stylin' golfer) and Wade Howard.
<P>     It was a great day!  Next time, YOU should play too..
<P>                                   <B><I>John Pierce</B></I>

Austin Skiers Do Aquarena Springs<BR></FONT></B></H4>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>By Angie Coleman</FONT></B></H4>
<P>     It was a dark and rainy night last month, when a small group of 
Austin Skiers braved the torrential rains and rush hour traffic of IH35
to reach San Marcos.  Their mission?  To boldly explore the hidden world
of Aquarena Springs, and observe the flora and fauna inhabiting the
cold, fresh water.
<P>     Upon suiting up, it was discovered that almost everyone had 
forgotten a critical piece of equipment, so John Pierce, being the most
severely handicapped by the lack of contact lenses, acted as the donor
diver and divided up his equipment among the rest of the team members. 
Allen Jackson, the evening's dive master, led the expedition to discover
numerous prawn, catfish, gar and sunken submarines.  Cindy Berry acted 
as navigator and kept the guides on the right path.  Fellow divers Ken
Jacquin, Mary Gasal, Kathy Collins, Wade Howard and others practiced
their shallow dive technique and enjoyed the unique aquatic life found
only in this central Texas habitat.
<P>     Even though it was raining cats and dogs when we started, the 
evening turned out well with several good &quot;sightings&quot; to speak
of at future Austin Skiers happy hours.
<P>                                   <B><I>Angie Coleman</B></I>

</FONT></B></H4>
<P>     Even though it seems like everybody and their dog is going to Italy, we still have space available on some of the other trips.  As of this
 writing (mid October) Keystone has one spot left for someone to go skiing at Thanksgiving.  Snowmass does have a full list but does not have
 an appreciable wait list.  Taos has plenty of room now but we will be having to make some decisions on cutbacks soon (possibly in December). 
 The short trip to Purgatory has room for 7 skiers to be skiing over Valentine's Day while Jackson Hole has room on some ground-only packages.
 The Spring Break trip to Mt. Bachelor, Oregon is just over half full at this point.  Don't wait around forever to sign up for that winter vacation. 
 The club has to make decisions several weeks before the trip departure date about the final size of the trip.
<P>     A note about wait lists:  For those people who have never had to deal with a wait list before, the deposit check is held by the trip chair until
 a space opens up on the trip.  At that time, they will contact you and confirm that you still want to go on the trip.  If the due date has passed,
 the trip chair will work out a date by which you will need to pay the remainder of the trip cost.
<P>     <B>Reminder</B>: To sign up for an Austin Skiers' trip you must be a current member (membership year begins June 1, 1996).  If you cannot make
 the meetings and would like to sign up for a trip by mail, call the trip chair and ask to receive a trip application form.  Mail your deposit of $100
 with your completed form back to the trip chair.  All prices listed include round trip air and bus transportation, lodging, pre-trip and post-trip
 parties.  Lift ticket prices are separate for all but the Italy trip.

<P>     This was one weekend when it helped to be 80 some miles west of
Austin.  I arrived at Enchanted Rock Thursday daytime and ended up with
a gorgeous day, sunset and then the Lunar eclipse to top off the
evening.  There was one thunderstorm that was tracking away from the
area and providing a great light show but no sound.  Friday morning was 
gray and misty but that stopped by noon.  Evidently, there was some
heavier rain that kept some people away from the park but it did result
in a very quiet and relaxed park up until about late Friday afternoon. 
By the time the skies cleared around nine p.m, we had eleven people at
our six campsites.  I had thought Holly Freeman had the largest tent in
the club until Jerry &amp; Robin Sexton showed up with a large dome tent
that almost completely covered a 12' x 17' pad site.  He said that what
takes the longest time to set up is the inside hot tub.
<P>     We were fortunate that Chuck Bowman brought plenty of firewood
since both Friday and Saturday night were chilly enough to warrant a
nice blazing fire.  Saturday morning was going along at a 
leisurely pace until midmorning when we finally got a group together to
climb on top of and all around Enchanted Rock.
<P>     When we got back to the campsite, Dale Young and Wendy Buck
had already arrived and gone to the top of the rock and back.  With the
clear skies and cool temperatures, there were a few mild sunburns during
the day.  Our troop also made another trek to the top to watch sundown
(no green flash this time either).  After some of us cooked dinner
(while others went into Fredericksburg) the rest of the evening was
spent around the campfire telling stories and a few jokes.  Ask Ben
Mathis to tell you the one about the old widow who took her dog to the
vet.
<P>     Sunday was another fine day with nary a cloud in sight.  While I
decided to head back to Austin about midmorning, the rest of the crew,
led by Wally Freeman, went on another hike.  And on that note, I close
this report on another successful campout.  It's been fun!

SIZE=6>The Texas Ski Council Goes Down Under</FONT></B></H4>

<P>     On Wednesday night, August 28, I was one of 15 lucky Texas Ski
 Council representatives who boarded an Air New Zealand 747 bound
 for an exciting journey to New Zealand - the land of unending
adventures, rugged snow covered alps, lush valleys, crystal clear lakes,
outstanding scenic beauty, very friendly people and millions of sheep.
<P>     After a 12 + hour non-smoking flight from Los Angeles we all
 began to realize this was no ordinary airline. The service and food was
 above average and the flight was long enough to sleep a good 7-9
 hours and feel rested. Our plane landed in Auckland (after crossing
 the international date line) on the morning of Friday, August 30, where
 we quickly cleared customs, changed planes and headed to
 Christchurch on the South Island. A quick shopping trip through the
 Christchurch airport, we then boarded the 60+ seat Mount Cook -
 Air New Zealand Link flight to our final destination, Queenstown.
 The scenic one + hour flight on a smaller plane was breathtaking.
<P>     The Gardens Parkroyal Hotel where we stayed for the 5 night
 trip was a delightful 4 star property, 2 blocks from town, overlooking
 the shores of the glacier fed Lake Wakatipu which is surrounding by
 beautiful mountains. Our double size rooms were large with one queen
 bed and one twin bed, two thick terry cloth robes, mini refrigerator,
 and a gorgeous view. After a quick check-in the group split up, some
 to pick up ski equipment brought to the hotel for our convenience
 and the rest of us to see the many scenic spots and shops Queenstown
 had to offer. I was amazed - I had enough sleep on the flight so that I
 had zero jet lag. The melatonin, ear plugs, slippers, neck pillow and
 sleep mask worked - I never travel without the necessities.
<P>     Downtown Queenstown is mainly a pedestrian only area with
 tons of shopping, eating and drinking opportunities. We found an
 excellent assortment of restaurants, some were expensive and elegant,
 several moderately priced and many options for the budget minded.
 Many of the pubs, which feature call and house drinks also offer great
 selections of New Zealand beer and wine. Dinner at a local pub is
 inexpensive, giving you options like burgers, pizza, soup, sandwiches,
 salads, etc. We had dinner that evening at the Mad Cow, what many
 New Zealanders say is the country's best pizza and local brew. 
 This was a perfect place to rub elbows in a cozy environment with the 
local Kiwis.
<P>     Temperatures in town ranged from the 30s at night to mid to
 high 50s during the day.
<P>     Saturday began with a wonderful breakfast buffet with cooked
 to order eggs, pancakes, cereal and fruit bar, and unusually good
coffee. That day we were blessed with sunny skies, and great snow con
ditions at the Coronet Ski field, only a short (30 minute) scenic
 drive from our hotel. The skiing, all above the tree line, was more
 than enough to keep us all busy for the day. The mountain had 4
 lifts and approx. 500 acres of terrain. Though smaller than US
standards, this ski field had a lot of variety and with open bowl
terrain
 you just skied where ever you wanted without anyone to get in your
 way. While on the mountain, I enjoyed a delicious lunch of homemade
soup, cheese, and a large assortment of fresh baked breads for
 about $6.50 US. Freshly baked multi-grain breads are served with
 every meal. You can also find burgers, fish and chips, sandwiches,
 pizza, etc. All are reasonably priced - less expensive than US ski
 resorts.
<P>     Sunday offered the same perfect weather which was great for
 viewing the fabulous sights as we climbed to the top of the Remarkable
mountain range for day two of skiing on open bowl terrain. The
 ski field similar in size to Coronet Peak had additional terrain
available but was inaccessible by lifts. The considerable hike up
rewarded
 each determined skier with a remarkable view of an alpine lake and
 untracked powder runs. At the advice of our guide, a group of us
 ventured onto a longer, very wide expert slope called &quot;Homeward
 Run.&quot; As the run neared the end it was necessary to ski through a
 gully (great fun) and finally down to a creek where a shuttle picked
 us up and transported us back to the base area. A word of warning:
 The road up to the Remarkable Ski Field should be left to an
experienced Kiwi driver. The views again were unbelievable. That night
 we cruised across the Lake Wakatipu in an early 1900 restored Steam
Ship, to Walter Peak, for a delicious multi-course buffet dinner and
 more New Zealand wine. After dinner we watched a very entertaining
demonstration of dogs working sheep and cattle. The movie
 &quot;Babe&quot; kept coming to mind - I didn't see any pigs though. (Cost:
 approx $60 NZ or $45 US per person - cruise, dinner and show in
cluded.) Well worth the expense.
<P>     Day three of skiing took a little longer (1 1/2 hours) going up to the
 Cardrona Ski Field. The wind had picked up but didn't stop us from
 enjoying the great open bowl terrain. Lunch (a chicken salad sandwich
 and drink cost me less than $5 US.) That evening we had the pleasure of
 dining at the Skyline Restaurant, a gondola ride to the top of Bob's Peak
 with views of the lights of Queenstown at night. (The gondola ride ($12
 NZ - $9 US) would offer even better views during the day. Queenstown's
 own Lone Star bar was the next stop for several in our group who met
 some of the locals and danced until the early morning hours.
<P>     By day five our group had visited several very nice hotels and
lodging properties. Most less than a 5 minute walk to the center of town
and
 with gorgeous views of Lake Wakatipu. There is a big difference between
 a 3 and 4 star property. Most of the 3 star hotels were farther from the
 center of town, only one had an onsite restaurant, but most offered
kitchenettes. The 3 stars were moderately decorated, all were very clean
with
 full sized baths (all had showers, some with no tubs) in each room.
(Compared to our US hotels: between Motel 6 and La Quinta.) Most of the
4
 star properties had two onsite restaurants, many with a separate bar, they
 were closer to town, nicely decorated, small refrigerators, some had
kitchenettes, hairdryer, robes, concierge and much better views.
(Compared
 to our US hotels: comparable to a Hilton.) The cost difference between
 a 3 and a 4 star hotel, for a week would be about $100-$120 US.
<P>     Our last day's adventures were some of the most memorable. The
 narrow Shotover river which feeds into Lake Wakatipu is located in a
 rugged, deep, winding canyon. All of us experienced the exhilarating
 thrill of jet boating down the shallow river at up to 60 kilometer speeds
 skidding within inches past rugged canyon walls, boulders, and
overhangs.
 The thrill and beauty of this adrenaline pumping experience can not be
 described in words - let's just say the ride is a blast and will scare the
 socks right off of you. The 30 minute ride costs approximately $51 NZ
 group rate, or $61 NZ for individuals. (About $37 to $46 US - the trip is
 well worth the money.) And, as if that thrill wasn't enough - we were 
off
 to the bungee bridge where four brave soles (not me) took turns diving
 head first off of a perfectly good bridge into a deep canyon. Each were
 awarded t-shirts and certificates honoring their survival. (The cost: $100
 NZ or $70 US.) Our evening ended at a dinner sponsored by the
 Queenstown Promotion Board held at the very hotel our U.S. Ski Team
 was staying. I didn't get to meet Tommy Moe - but that was the closest I
 have ever been.
<P>     The morning we left came all too quickly. The flight home included
a first class experience in the upper cabin of our 747 bound for our
connection in Sydney, Australia - we enjoyed every minute of the two and
a half hour flight. It was necessary to connect in Sydney because Air
New
 Zealand had taken some of their planes out of commission for refitting,
 adding foot rests, wing back seats and they were taking some seats out to
 add more leg room (this was happening in the economy section). As a
 group we were all very impressed with the service and attention we re
ceived from Bob McEarland, President of Holidaze Tours and Steve
 Campbell with Air New Zealand. (Both agreed they would travel with
 our TSC group if we returned in 1998.) The New Zealand hosts we had
 the pleasure to meet were all very friendly, helpful and gracious.
<P>     To end this very long article - A trip to New Zealand is one you will
 never forget. The many beautiful, thrilling and once in a lifetime
experiences will make you want to stay in the &quot;Land of the Long
White Cloud&quot;
 for a long, long time. I have lots of photos and videos to share with
 anyone who wants to see them. Look for more information regarding
 New Zealand when we receive a bid for the April bid meeting in San
 Antonio.

<P>     Yes, folks, it has already started to snow in the Rockies! 
Now if it will just stick around The signup lines at the September meeting
were about what we expected for the Italy and Jackson Hole trip. The 
Snowmass and Purgatory trips somewhat surprised me in that they also
almost filled up that night. Even with all that activity, we still have
room for more people to go skiing. Taos has plenty of space as well as
the Mt Bachelor, OR long and short trip. The Purgatory short trip still
has room for Valentine's day and is taking a wait list for the long
trip.
<P>     A note about wait lists: For those people who have never had to 
deal with a wait list before, the deposit check is held by the trip
chair until a space opens up on the trip. At that time, they will contact 
you and confirm that you still want to go on the trip. If the due
date has passed, the trip chair will work out a date by which you will 
need to pay the remainder of the trip cost.
<P>     <B>Reminder: </B>To sign up for an Austin Skiers' trip you must 
be a current member (membership year begins June 1, 1996). If you cannot
make the meetings and would like to sign up for a trip by mail, call the

<P>     It's time to select that ideal trip now! Mark
 your calendars for September 10th where it will be your first opportunity to sign-up for trips to
 Snowmass, Italy, Taos, Purgatory, Jackson Hole, and Mt. Bachelor. There will be plenty of chances
 to win exciting prizes as well. If your membership
 was paid by August 23rd, (received by Austin Skiers by that time) you
qualify for early admission to the Extravaganza. If you qualify for
&quot;early
 admission,&quot; the doors will open at 7:00 P.M., and
 no one else will be admitted until 7:30. The Membership and Guest Registration Table will open
 at 6:30 P.M.
<P>     To allow access for all members to sign-up for
 a trip, some special rules will apply for the &quot;early
 admission&quot; period during the September Skier Extravaganza. These
rules will be enforced for all members, officers and volunteers.
Officers and
 volunteers will be permitted to sign-up for trips prior to the doors opening for the meeting. For
 &quot;early admission,&quot; 7:00 P.M. Until 7:30 P.M., these
 rules will apply:
<P>     Rule 1: Single memberships can turn in trip
 applications for up to two people, themselves and one other person. Family memberships can sign
-up their immediate family as defined in the bylaws (Art. III, Sec. 1). There is no limit on the
 number of trips for which a member can turn in trip applications. (Meaning you can sign-up for
 as many trips as you want.)
<P>     Rule 2: All trip applications turned in by mem
bers, officers or volunteers before 7:30 P.M. must qualify for &quot;early admission&quot; (their membership
 must have been received by August 23rd) or the application may be subject to removal from the
 trip.
<P>     Rule 3: During the &quot;early admission&quot; period,
 once a member has turned in a set of trip applications, to sign-up additional members they must
 return to the end of the line at the trip table.
<P>     At 7:30 P.M., the &quot;early admission&quot; period
 ENDS and there is no restrictions on the number of trip applications turned in by any one mem
ber; however, all trip applications submitted must be for members in
good standing at time of sign-up.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>By Jackie Bayly-Bryant</FONT></B></H4>

<P>     By the time you receive this newsletter I will be
 on my way home from the New Zealand fam trip. But for right now, which is late August, I am just a few
 days away from the land down under. This is a tough
 time to write an article because I am fighting the urge
 to work on all the things I need to do before I leave.
 Plus, a few nights ago I watched a 30 minute Warren
 Miller video on NZ which really opened my eyes as to how much this beautiful and diverse country has
 to offer. Which reminds me, I need to buy film. Can
 you tell, I am very excited about this trip and the
 possibility of our club going in the summer of  '98?
<P>     OK, let me refocus . . . Here is the latest. The
 Texas Ski Council Delegates meeting was held in Austin, August 17 with clubs from around the state
 in attendance. Discussion from the meeting included:
<P>     The TSC Directory will be available to our club
 members very soon. We will distribute them at a club
 meeting when we get them.
<P>     The TSC member clubs will be asking their members for input on TSC officers' right to vote during
 the bid meetings. As of now, the TSC officers have
 no vote towards choosing ski areas for our 5 TSC sponsored trips. Our club will need to decide if the TSC officers should not vote during the bid process or if they do vote just how many votes are they entitled.
<P>     The TSC has set a goal to increase the number of
 participants in 1995-96 TSC trips by 25%. A prize (1
 free ski trip package) will be awarded to the club with
 the largest % of increase over last year. Our club is at
 an estimated 52% increase over last year's TSC trips.
 Final numbers will be shared at the April bid meeting in San Antonio. I will keep you posted.
<P>     The following clubs will be represented on the
 TSC preselect committee: Dallas, Corpus Christi, Capital Downhillers and West Central. Preselect members will decide on which ski areas submitting
 bids will be allowed to make presentations at the April,
 97 bid meeting in San Antonio. It is a lot of fun, please
 think about attending.
<P>     Ski Fest will be held in Dallas on November 15 -
 17. Anyone interested in attending from Austin should
 talk to John Pierce or Kent Wick.
<P>     Sun &amp; Ski and Oshman's are once again sponsoring the TSC and that will benefit our local members.
 The Sun &amp; Ski sponsorship will offer discounts on ski
 purchases, though the details are not confirmed. Oshman's will provide our members with one time
 20% discount coupons that can be used on any ski merchandise. Deck time and equipment tuning/repairs
 are 50% off as they have been in the past. Look for
 more details as we get them.
<P>     TSC Club races: The Keystone Nastar race order
 was drawn. Our club will race 5th out of 17 clubs at
tending the Fall Roundup trip. Our club will be the
 6th out of 14 clubs to race during the TSC Snowmass
 Traditional trip. And speaking of trips . . . at the present
 time the number of Texans attending each of the TSC
 trips are:
<P>     Keystone/Fall Roundup     454 from 17 clubs
<P>     Snowmass/Traditional     795 from 14 clubs <B>!WOW!</B>
<P>     Val Di Fassa/Expedition     470 from 13 clubs
<P>     Purgatory/Winter Shootout     393 from 13 clubs
<P>     Sugarloaf/Final Showdown     361 from 12 clubs
 (We are not going on this trip but if you are interested
 in attending Sugarloaf talk to Kent Wick.)
<P>     Next month I will tell you all about the upcoming
 Austin Skiers Photo Contest. Aren't you excited now!
 Until then check out our wonderful trip line up and
 all the great special activities we have planned for the
 fall and winter. And, don't forget to start your work
 out or conditioning program for the fast approaching
 ski season. That's all for now folks. See you at the September 10th meeting.

<P>     Join us for these FUN events over the next couple of months. I hope everyone can find something of
 interest; if not, let me know of an event you would like to see on the calendar. If you can help with any of
 these below, call me at 345-7997.
<P>Happy Hours for September are at Top of the Marc
<P>Sept. 8     Charles Gordon and John Pierce will co-host a Golf tournament at Lions Municipal Golf Course.
 Tee-off time will be at 1:00 p.m. There will be a trophy for the longest ball and one for closest to the
 hole. The green fees are $15 per person, and a cart will be an additional $8.25 per person. The $15
 green fees is due to John Pierce by the sign-up deadline which is Sept. 3. (Cart fee can be paid at the
 course) Contact John at 892-7699.
<P>Sept. 27-28     The fall Campout will be held at Enchanted Rock State Park. There will be a full moon on Friday, so
 you will have an opportunity to look to the East and watch the sunset and then turn to the West and
 watch the moon rise. You get the same thing on Saturday, but you will have to wait a little longer for
 the moon rise. The rock is beautiful in the moonlight. The cost will be $10 per person to cover the
 park fees; all you campers get your money to Kent Wick by Sept. 20th to reserve a campsite. Kent's
 phone is 835-1522. This is a BYO - everything campout. By the way, I do know that the sun sets in the
 west &#173; just checking to see if you skiers pay attention to detail.

<P>     We already have our first sold out trip of the year! So many people want to go to Keystone at Thanksgiving that we are going
 to attempt to add some air and ground spaces to this trip. Talk to Neil Martin for specifics and availability. I knew the August
 meeting had a lot of people there but didn't realize that around 190 people came through the doors. With a high demand for the
 Italy and Jackson Hole trips leading the way, we expect the September meeting to be busy as well. <U>
For those of you intending to go on the Italy trip, make sure that you read Greg's articles in this newsletter carefully.</U>
 All prices listed include round trip air and bus transportation, lodging, pre-trip and post-trip parties. Lift ticket prices are separate for all but the Italy trip.
<P>     Reminder: to sign up for an Austin Skiers' trip you must be a current member (membership year begins June 1, 1996). Our
 SKI EXTRAVAGANZA sign up meeting will be Tuesday, September 10th, when all the trips are available for taking applica
tions. <U>Be sure to read the sign-up rules we have instituted for the early sign-up period during the September meeting.</U>
 Don't miss the excitement and the opportunity to sign up for a trip early, as with last year's September meeting, some trips may be full
 by the end of the evening! So check your membership and make sure it is current. If you cannot make the September meetings
 and would like to sign up for a trip by mail, call the trip chair and ask to receive a trip application form. Mail your deposit of $100
 with your completed form back to the trip chair. All applications and deposits received in the mail will be placed in the order
 received following all other applications collected during the club meeting.
<P>
<P>
<P>Keystone, Colorado
<P>November 27 - December 1, 1996 -- $599
<P>Trip Chair:  Neil Martin  250-0238
<P>     (Texas Ski Council Fall Roundup) This trip is sure to be one of the most memorable ski trips of the year. Guaranteed skiing
 both night and day, 5,800 acres of skiing, a chance to watch the World Cup in person and Thanksgiving dinner with over 400
 TSC friends. We will be staying in 2 bed/2 bath condos at the Pines in Keystone Village. With your lift ticket you will be able to
 ski trails on any of the eight mountains that comprise both the Keystone and Breckenridge ski areas. The TSC activities also
 include the Welcome reception, Mountain Picnic and Final Awards party (oh yes there will be some races held in there some
where as well). This trip sold out during the August 13th meeting with an additional 14 people on the waiting list. We are in the
 process of attempting to get additional air and lodging.
<P>
<P>Salt Lake City, Utah
<P>December 28 - January 2, 1997 -- $547
<P>Trip Chair: Ben Mathis 385-3575
<P>     Let's go skiing! Join the Austin Skiers in Salt Lake City during the New Year holiday. Salt Lake County is considered one of
 North America's finest ski destinations with nine ski resorts within an hour of the Salt Lake airport. The four resorts of Alta,
 Snowbird, Brighton and Solitude annually receive nearly 500 inches of powder snow; more snow than any other ski area in the
 United States. We will be staying at the Days Inn just 1/2 block south of the I-15 and 7200 south intersection of Salt Lake. These
 rooms have mini-refrigerators and microwaves to assist in fixing those late night snacks. Trip Size: 24. Lifts: varies with ski area.
<P>
<P>Snowmass, Colorado
<P>January 4 - 11, 1997 -- $735 (plus $135 for 5 day lift)
<P>Trip Chair: Ken Jacquin  345-7997
<P>     If you are looking for ski in-ski out, this is the trip as we will be staying in the Tamarack Townhomes in Snowmass Village right
 at the base of the Snowmass Fanny Hill lift. These townhomes are within easy walking distance to shops, restaurants and a
 grocery store. Each unit has a fully furnished kitchen so you can prepare your own gourmet meals. Bring your swimsuit so you can
 relax in the heated pool and spa after skiing. Most of the units are two bedroom/two bath condos with one additional unit which
 will be holding six people. The trip incudes round trip air from Austin, lodging, ground transfers, the TSC club and individual
 races, and several parties.
<P>     Your lift ticket is good at Aspen, Aspen Highlands, Buttermilk and Snowmass. All of these mountains are within 13 miles of
 Tamarack and you can get to all of them on a free shuttle. Together these mountains offer 4500 skiable acres with access via 41 lifts. There are numerous ski runs here for every level of skier from beginner to double black diamond expert. With an average
 snowfall of 300 inches per year, the Aspen/Snowmass area is one of the premier areas for skiing. Since this is the Texas Ski
 Council Traditional Ski Week (so named because once upon a time it was the <U>
only</U> ski week), our group will be part of the almost
 800 Texas skiers that decided to have a good time in Snowmass. There will be a Welcome Reception, picnic on the mountain
 (during the week), a Caribbean Beach party, the club races on Thursday, the individual races on Friday and a Final Awards party
 Friday evening. For some lucky skier, there may also be a guided tour of the new burnt Mountain area of Snowmass. The guided
 tour requires that you be an advanced intermediate and up. Trip includes: Roundtrip air from Austin, lodging in 2 bed/2 bath
 condo, ground transportation, pre and post trip parties, TSC parties and NASTAR racing, 42 spaces available. For more informa
tion call Ken Jacquin at 512-345-7997.
<P>
<P>Expedition To Italy
<P>$1120 / Double Room  $1195 / Single Room
<P>January 17 - 25, 1997
<P>Trip Chair: Greg Bryant  836-1661
<P>Assistant Trip Chair: Tom Zimmermann  331-1961
<P>     Attention skiing, sight-seeing and partying fans, we're heading back to Italy! That's right, last year's trip was such a great
 success that the Texas Ski Council decided to follow our lead and take the Texas European Expedition to Italy. Our destination
 this year is Val Di Fassa, located in the heart of Italy's north central Dolomite mountains. This mountain valley in the Italian
 Alps, surrounded by some of the most magnificent mountains on earth, is the training ground of Alberto Tomba, and where
 Sylvester Stallone chose to film his movie &quot;Cliffhanger&quot;. Once part of Austria, and still considered part of the southern Tyrol, the
 region combines the local traditions of quality and hospitality with almost endless skiing opportunities.
<P>     The more than half dozen ski areas that serve the Fassa valley combine to offer 80 lifts and over 125 miles of groomed runs. But
 this is only a small part of the region's 464 lifts, 750 miles of marked trails (20% beginner / 70% intermediate), and countless
 interconnected ski areas. The Ski Council will be visiting a different area each day by private, continuously running, motor coach
 service, or you can take the free local ski bus to any resort in the area. Cortina, Val Gardena, and the legendary Sellaronda are just
 a few of the famous ski routes and resorts that you'll have the opportunity visit. And all lifts in the region are accessible with the
 6-day Dolomiti SuperSki Pass that is included in the package. Or you can take a few days off for the optional non skiing day-trips
 to see the sights and shops of Venice and Trentino, the capital of the region.
<P>     Our adventure begins on Friday January 17 and returns Saturday January 25 with roundtrip air service on Continental from
 Houston Intercontinental Airport, via Newark and Alitalia airlines, to Milan. If last year was any indication, the Continental
/Alitalita partnership will provide us first class service on our international flight, and at the same time allow you to earn better
 than 10,000 Continental OnePass flier miles. Upon arrival in Milan early Saturday morning, we will travel the scenic Italian
 countryside in our private motor coaches to the home base for all of the Texas Ski Council clubs, Moena. In this quaint mountain
 town dating to the 1100's, we'll be taking over all of the new 3 Star+ Hotel Soldanella, whose amenities include a private bath,
 phone, TV and safe in each room, along with hotel sauna and steam room. For our gastronomic pleasure, the hotel will provide
 a buffet breakfast and multi-course dinner daily, all included in the trip price. And besides our usual pre and post trip parties, the
 tour operator will be hosting both a welcome and farewell party for the entire Texas Ski Council.
<P>     And the fund doesn't have to stop here. If you want to see even more of Italy, you'll have the opportunity to extend your visit
 and experience the historical and artistic splendor or Rome, Venice and Florence! So join Austin Skiers and 400+ other Texas
 Ski Council participants on what is sure to be a fun filled week to remember! This trip may fill fast, so plan on being early to the
 September 10 sign-up meeting!
<P>     Trip Includes: RT Air and Ground Transport + 10,000 Continental Air Miles! 7 Nights Lodging with Breakfast and Dinner
 Daily, 6 Day Lift Ticket for entire Dolomite Ski Region, Pre/post Trip and TSC Welcome and Farewell Parties, Optional Daytrips
 to Venice, Trentino and Cortina, Extensions to Rome, Florence and Venice, 70 spaces available (32 double/6 single rooms).
<P>Payment balance due date 11/12/96.
<P>     IMPORTANT NEW INFORMATION! Due to the drop in value of the U.S. dollar vs. the Italian lire since the Val Di Fassa
 bid was accepted last April, as per our tour contract, there may be a cost increase if the ground portion of all trip openings is not
 paid in full by the end of September. In an effort to avoid any price increase, if at least 90% of the trip participants can make
 a $500 trip payment at the September 10 sing-up meeting, we can lock in the current advertised price of $1120 double/
 $1195 single occupancy. If we do not receive this $500 deposit from 90% of the participants, any increase will be based on the
exchange rate just prior to the final payment due date of November 12. Based on current trends, an increase of $20-$30 per person
 is possible. For more details about our Texas Expedition to Italy call Greg @ 836-1661. *Airfare is out of Houston Intercontinen
tal Airport.
<P>
<P>Taos, New Mexico
<P>January 29- February 1, 1997 -- $465
<P>Trip Chair: Donna Connell  433-3923
<P>     Forty years ago, what others saw as a mountain too steep to ski, was Ernie Blake's vision of a ski purist's paradise. Today, Taos
 Ski Valley is the world-class resort Ernie envisioned. Taos Mountain, part of the Sangre de Cristo Range of the Rocky Mountains,
 set the state for beautiful skiing. It insists on attention and respect. The Austin Skiers will be flying into Albuquerque and busing
 to Taos for three days of great skiing. Lodging will be in town at the Don Fernando Holiday Inn, where a full breakfast and shuttle
 to the mountain is included. On the way back home, we will even stop in Santa Fe for  a few hours of shopping. Trip Size: 32. Lifts:
 $90 (3 day)

<P>     (Texas Ski Council Winter Shootout) We will be flying on American directly into Durango, a true wild-west town. The
 Strater hotel, built in 1887, will be our home in downtown Durango, providing easy access to shopping and restaurants. Each
 room is uniquely decorated with beautiful antiques. Free shuttle busses will provide transportation to the mountain and to the
 TSC activities held elsewhere. Purgatory also has the unique &quot;Total Ticket&quot; which allows you to trade up to two days of your lift
 pass for other activities, like snowmobiling or a trip on the narrow gauge railroad. Trip Size: 26 long trip and 14 short trip. Lift

 direct to Jackson Hole through Salt Lake on our way to the Lodge at Jackson Hole, which is in town and a short complimentary
 bus trip to both the ski resort and the airport. Each room at the Lodge accommodates two people and has access to spas, saunas
 and an in/outdoor pool. Home to 4, 139' of vertical, Jackson has over 2,500 acres of incredible skiing. The &quot;100,000 Foot Club&quot;
 is an honor bestowed on those of you that can really tackle the mountain. Excitement abounds amid the splendor of one of the
 finest national treasures: XC skiing, snowmobiling and wildlife tours. Trip size is 42 + 2 ground only spaces. The separate 5-day lift

<P>Trip Chair: Jim Howalt  331-8117
<P>     After our first very successful trip here in 1995, we are returning to Mt. Bachelor. Although it is not so well known, Mt.
 Bachelor is one of the top rated ski areas in the nation with 3,100 vertical feet, 3,200 skiable acres, over 300 inches of annual
 snowfall and 7 (count 'em) high speed quad lifts. Ski runs are well balanced for all ability levels with 15% beginner, 55% interme
diate and 25% advanced. There are also extensive cross-country facilities at the base of the mountain for those members whose
 interests lie in that direction. We will be staying in condos at the Sun River Resort and will have our own bus all week for our
 transportation.

SIZE=6>Cave Tour</FONT></B></H4>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>By Ken Jacquin, V.P. Activities</FONT></B></H4>

<P>     On Saturday, August 10th, we went on an outing to the &quot;Cave without a name&quot; located near Boerne, Texas. The cave tour
 starts by descending a 100 foot spiral staircase and then continues through five large rooms filled with beautiful formations. The
 tour guide was justifiable proud of his large bacon strips, his river, and his wishing well with its' overflow area of terraced pools of
 water. Bacon strips are like thin veils of rock that form down the side of the wall; due to their color variations they do appear to
 be large bacon strips; these were about 1 foot wide and 15 feet long. Unfortunately the wishing well and its' overflow area, which
 I am sure would be spectacular if full of water, was dry due to the current drought. At the end of the fifth room is the underground
 river that formed this cave; and in spite of the drought, there as a small flow of water in the river. We were continually reminded
 by the tour guide that he needed a 10 inch rain to get everything dripping. The tour guide even played us a little of his &quot;hard rock
 music&quot; by lightly tapping on some of the formations with a small stick.
<P>     It was difficult for those on the outing to decide which was more interesting, the beauty of the cave or the character of the tour
 guide. The tour guide is a 78 yr. old gentleman who has owned and guided tours through &quot;his&quot; cave for 34 years (that is something
 like 35 thousand trips up and down the stairs.) This is a unique one-man business. If he is in the cave when your arrive, you wait
 until he comes up out of the cave. When he takes you into the cave for the hour and fifteen minute tour, he locks the iron gates
 behind you.
<P>     After the cave tour we adjourned for some sight seeing in Boerne and then we all convened for dinner at the &quot;Country Spirit&quot;
 Restaurant. I think I can speak for all of those attending that I recommend this cave tour to anyone who was unable to join us. I
 have instructions on how to get there for anyone interested; instructions are required for it is impossible to find it any other way.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>By Ken Jacquin, V.P. Activities</FONT></B></H4>

<P>     On Saturday July 27th a group of Austin Skiers set out to take a 10 mile bike ride on Creek Road in Dripping Springs.
 However, due to a slight miscalculation on the part of our tour guide (me), most of use ended up taking about a fifteen mile ride.
 Aided by a favorable cooling breeze, we had a very enjoyable leisurely ride. This route runs parallel to Onion Creek and even with
 the drought, the creek was still pleasing to the eye. When we complete the ride we all enjoyed a tail-gate party of Quissadillas and
 breakfast tacos. We all went home with full stomachs and tired legs. Those attending were : Gabe Ayson, Jim Burke, Terry
 Champion, Jim Davis, Barb Jacquin, Ken Jacquin, Janice Kaczmarek, and Mickey McKinney.

<P>It's amazing how fast a year goes by. We are already at the
halfway point to the next ski season. That must mean that it is time
to really start talking about the upcoming season and which trip to
attend. Based on the phone calls that we have received both in
response to our earlier " show of hands" interest in the Italy trip
and received by the trip chairs, the August and September meetings
should be fairly lively. All prices listed include round trip air and
bus transportation, lodging, pre-trip and post-trip parties. Lift
ticket prices are sepa rate for all but the Italy trip. In the last
newsletter, we mentioned that the prices may change due to the 10%
federal tax being imposed. Since it looks likely that this will
occur, we decided to set the trip prices with this tax included.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Reminder: </B>To sign up for an Austin Skiers' trip, you must be a
current member (membership year begins June 1, 1996). Our first trip
sign up meeting will be Tuesday, August 13, when we will begin early
sign ups for the Thanksgiving and New Year's trips. All other trips
will be open for sign up at our SKI EXTRAVAGANZA, September 13. Don't
miss the excitement and the opportunity to sign up for a trip early,
as with last year's September meeting, some trips may be full by the
end of the evening! So check your membership and make sure it is
current. If you cannot make the August or September meetings and
would like to sign up by mail, call the trip chair and ask to receive
a trip appli cation form. Mail your deposit of $100 with your com
pleted form back to the trip chair. All applications and deposits
received in the mail will be placed in the order received following
all other applications collected dur ing the club meeting.<BR>

<P>Texas summers --- HOT!! Last thing on your mind is snow, right? You
better change that line of thinking, because in just a few days, at
our August 13th monthly meeting, you will be able to sign up for our
first ski trips of the 1996-97 season! Please read about our
Thanksgiv ing and New Year's trips in the Keystone, Colorado and Salt
Lake City, Utah articles, respectively. Also at the August meeting is
our ski swap; see "Ye Olde Bargain Shoppe" for more information.<BR>

<BR>

Just a month away is our MAJOR sign-up meeting for this season's
trips. The "And they're off" article gives all the details. To
further increase your chances of going on the trip that you want to,
PLEASE read "AUSTIN SKIers EXTRAVAGANZA," which contains some
important rules. Good luck!<BR>

Now, if you want to really start planning ahead, be sure and read
"Off to the land down under." Jackie tells about some exciting
research she gets to do later in the month. She will be doing more
than thinking about snow in August!<BR>

<BR>

By the way, some of you have been asking "where's that Lake Tahoe
trip article?" Have you looked at the latest milk carton? You know,
the "Have you seen me?" There's a picture of the Tahoe article and
Pepe, who was last seen with it. Anybody seen Pepe lately? Let us
know.<BR>

<BR>

Thanks go to Martin DeStefano for letting us have the Ski Club party
at his lake house. Additional thanks go to REI for hosting our last
monthly meeting. A good lecture and slide show about rock climbing.
Thanks, Mario!<BR>

<BR>

"Fun on the horizon" lets you know about all the events in -between
the meeting ; we're not just a ski club!</P>

   <DT>Believe it or not, the ski season is just around the corner
   which means it's time to sign up for that special trip. Here is
   how you can get early admission to the September meeting. Just
   renew your Austin Skier membership dues by August 23, 1996. It's
   easy! Your membership must be received at the PO Box before August

</DL>

<P><BR>

To help streamline the sign up process and to allow a more equitable
access for all members to sign up on high demand trips, we have put
some rules in place for the initial 30 minutes of the August and
September meetings. These rules will be enforced for all members,
officers and volunteers.<BR>

<BR>

During the first 30 minutes of the August and September meetings:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Rule 1:</B> A Single membership can sign up themselves and one
other person. A Family membership can sign up their im mediate family
as defined in the bylaws (Art III, Sec 1). There is no limit on the
number of trips for which a member can turn in trip applications.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Rule 2:</B> All trip applications turned in by members, officers
or volunteers during the first 30 minutes of the September meeting
must qualify for "early entry" or may be subject to removal from the
trip.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Rule 3: </B>Current Austin Skiers Officers and volunteers asso
ciated with the meeting may sign up in advance of opening the doors
to the general membership following the restrictions of Rule 1. After
admitting the general membership to the room, officers and volunteers
will follow the same rules as everyone else.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Rule 4: </B>During the "early sign up" period, once a member has
turned in a set of trip applications, they may return to the end of
the line at the trip table to sign up additional members.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Rule 5: </B>After the initial 30 minutes of the meeting, the
"early sign up" period is over and there will be no restrictions on
the number of trip applications turned in by any one member.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Rule 6: </B>All trip applications turned in must be for members in
good standing at time of sign up.</P>

to the Land Down Under</FONT></B></H4>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><B>By Jackie Bayly-Bryant, President</B></H4>

<P>Where on this great earth can you find a small country about the
size of Colorado offering such startling contrasts: warm enough to
grow citrus fruits, sub-antarctic enough to support penguins, whales
and seals. Where else can you ski an alpine glacier, roam great
tracts of unspoiled wilderness from rain forests to volcanos, bungy
jump 340 feet off of a bridge into a breathtaking gorge, jet boat
down a raging river or visit the farmland of the famous pig "Babe"?
New Zealand - described by writer James Michener as the most
beautiful country on earth, offers all of this and much, much
more.<BR>

<BR>

If you attended our June meeting held at the Lions Municipal golf
club house, then you heard me ask if any of our members were
interested in supporting a ski trip to New Zealand during July, 1998.
(June through August are winter months in New Zealand.) Why was this
brought up? Last April, during the Texas Ski Council bid meeting in
San Antonio, clubs across Texas voted down a Tour Company's bid for a
July '97 New Zealand trip. The main feeling expressed during the bid
meeting was that the trip was too expensive, though no evidence
existed as to whether or not it was a good value.<BR>

<BR>

After the bid meeting, the tour company approached the Texas Ski
Council once again and during our TSC delegates meeting held June 8
in Dallas, much discussion ensued as to whether a New Zealand trip
could or would be supported by Texas Clubs. I couldn't answer the
question directly without input from our members, so I came back and
presented the question at our June club meeting and counted at least
22 out of 50 or so people interested in supporting the proposed 10
day trip at the estimated cost of $1,780. Many of our members at the
club meeting said, "though the trip is more costly than our usual
trips, what you get for the cost is a good value." The estimated
figure of $1,780 includes air from Austin to Queenstown, NZ; 10
nights lodging at a 3 star hotel; transfers; breakfast each dayand 2
parties during the stay. Queenstown is a short bus drive away from 2+
ski resorts. After hearing from our club and several others, the
Texas Ski Council agreed to accept a familiarization (fam) trip from
the tour company to Queenstown, NZ. Similar to the Italy fam trip
Tere Ayson attended this past winter, this trip will offer the Texas
Ski Council and member clubs the opportunity to become more
acquainted with the area and to experience the skiing, hotels and
sites first hand.<BR>

<BR>

I am the fortunate Austin Skier who will attend the New Zealand fam
trip with the Texas Ski Council. Our 7 day trip departs August 28 at
10 p.m. from Los Angeles. After a 12 + hour flight through several
time zones, we will arrive at Auckland (North Island of NZ) and
change planes to Queenstown (South Island). Though a 5 night trip is
not a long time when traveling so far, we will be able to ski 3 days,
each night visiting several hotel sites and we will spend 1 day
seeing what Queenstown has to offer. (Thanks to all of you who
offered to carry my bags. I appreciate your willingness to be so
helpful.) Of course I am very excited about this wonderful
opportunity and, like previous fam trip participants, I promise to
ask a lot of questions, collect tons of information, and submit a
detailed report to the TSC and to our club. I will take video and
photos to share with our Trip Planning Committee and with anyone else
who want to see them. If anyone has questions or information for me
to ask about please give me a call. You will hear more about NZ from
me again in early September after all the Melatonin wears off.<BR>

<BR>

Until then, think about the wonderful trips we have planned for the
96-97 ski season and attend the August 13th meeting at the Hilton to
visit with trip chairs, to sign up for the Thanksgiving and New
Year's trips or to check out our ski equipment/clothes swap.<BR>

<BR>

So, G'day, mate. I am headed down under where the water swirls
clockwise or which ever direction it is opposite to ours.<BR>

<B>(or we recreate Gone with the &quot;Wind&quot;)</B> <BR>

<BR>

Since we were staying at a campground where the sites are reserved ahead of 
time, I was taking my time packing up Friday morning when I got a phone call 
from Rich Ellmer. It seems that he and Pat Dobberfuhl were so eager to camp 
out that they had arrived at the park by 10 a.m. I got 
there about an hour later and we proceeded to set up our sites and 
mark them so that other campers wouldn't assume they were unused. 
Dale Young showed up around lunch time whereupon Rich graciously let us 
sample his weenie cooking. Dale and I then proceeded to explore the area
around the park and down by the shoreline. We got into some real off
road sections (i.e. there weren't any trails) for a while before re
turning to the regular trails. <BR>
<BR>
Terry Champion, Cherilyn Hack, George Walters, Russ Prickett and Mark
Heldoorn made it out during Friday afternoon. The wind was blowing
enough that we decided to take advantage of the spare tarps that George
and I brought along and hung them up on the shelter supports to make a
wind break around the table. It made a definite difference after the sun
went down because we were able to sit outside without too much problem
from excessive wind cooling. Cherilyn decided
to surprise us when she came back from a grocery run with two gallons 
of ice cream. Seems as though she had misunderstood exactly how many
people would be out Friday night versus Saturday night. Those of us 
who were there made sure that it didn't melt. We ate it all. 
Meanwhile, Mark and Russ revived an old institution of the 
campout with some guitar playing and singing. <BR>
<BR>

Saturday morning was a leisurely affair with nobody really in a hurry 
to get up. Some of us were wondering where Terry had slept because her 
tent wasn't set up. Turns out that the rear seat of her car folds forward 
and opens up a passage to the rear storage area. However, the gap wasn't quite big enough for her to turn over without moving forward or back. Later in the morning, Dale and I ended up all the way around at Russell Park. With the wind continuing to blow at a good clip, it made it tiring (at least for me) to go into the wind. We made it back in time for lunch and then settled down to watch the Georgetown air show. About midway through this, Chuck and Janice Tysor showed in their new mini-camper. Pete Boisvert, Valerie Young and Wendy Buck proceeded to get the grand tour even before the camper was unhitched. (Upon entry, you are in the dining room. Take one half step to the left and you are in the kitchen. Another full step and you are in the bathroom.) Later in the afternoon, Greg and Jackie Bryant arrived to join the rest of us in some hard relaxing followed by a short ride around the subdivision just outside the park.
<BR>
<h5>Great Barbecue at the May Campout! </H5>

<BR>
Long about 6 p.m., I persuaded Wendy to let us use her car to get the
barbecued brisket and fixin's for the Saturday evening meal. Once we got
back to the camp sites, it didn't take any time at all for us to get
everything set up so that we could make short work of it. Later on in
the evening, we started up a fire in the fire ring so that we could
toast the marshmallows and make some s'mores. Part of the entertainment
was the imagination of what people were trying to do with the
marshmallows after setting them aflame. Some of us just bypassed all the
work and broke off pieces of chocolate. <BR>

<BR>

Sunday morning breakfast was a cooperative venture with three stoves 
going to heat water for the coffee, cook the eggs and sausage. 
This was aided by the cooks sampling the mimosas. I must report though, 
that nothing was burned or overdone. A big thank you to all the
breakfast cooks. Most of the rest of the morning was spent in slowly
packing up the camp. Part of this was caused by the wind still blowing
off the lake at about 10 to 15 miles an hour. <BR>
<P>
Next time we hope to see you on the trip as well!

<P>Hello, snow skiers! Looks like all the ski resorts are closed for 
skiing now. Only the diehards who hike and go glacier skiing or those 
willing to cross the equator can do any serious snow schussing in July. 
<BR>
However, you can Think Snow for next season and look at our trip
lineup - start planning your fun now. If summertime is on your mind,
read about the campout - did you miss out on the s'mores? Don't overlook
any more social events: read the article and calendar 
covering all the great Special Activities coming up. 
What about mountain climbing? Please come to our next meeting and 
learn about gear and maybe you will win one of the cool doorprizes. <BR>

<BR>
How about sharing some of your time helping Austin Skiers! Peruse the list of volunteer opportunities and assist. By the way, if you have any articles for the newsletter, please call me. I am very interested in suggestions as to what you would like to see in <strong>YOUR</strong> newsletter.
<BR>
See you at the meeting at REI... Phil Rowe

Preview of 1996-1997 Ski Trips</B> <BR>

<BR>

In the words of the Christmas song: Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow. 
Yes, it's summer time in Austin. So what do the Austin Skiers do to 
keep cool? Why, plan a ski trip of course. Some of the trip details are 
still being finalized but hopefully they will be complete by the time
you read this article. We are still working on air fares for one trip,
exploring the possibility of another short trip and finishing up last
minute details. For those of us who have been working on the trips over
the past 4 months, we have to stop and remember that the rest of the
club doesn't know about the trips yet. <BR>

<BR>

To assist everyone in planning for the August and September sign-up meetings, 
we have some preliminary information which includes an estimated price 
(give or take $20) and the designated Trip Chair. We will have firm prices 
in next month's newsletter for the August sign-up meeting. All prices
listed include round trip air and bus transportation, lodging, pre-trip
and post-trip parties. <BR>

We Want You!!!</B> <BR>

<BR>

June was a busy month for the new Board of Directors. We started the 
month with two planning/budget meetings to look at the successes from 
the past year and areas our new board will focus on for 1996-97. One plan 
for the 1996-97 year is to increase our volunteer involvement in the
club. There are many volunteer opportunities available that may involve
a time commitment of a couple of hours each month to a few hours each
week. The bottom line is we need able, willing bodies to give a little
time. You will find the rewards are great. Not only will you make new
friends along the way, your investment of time will help keep our
non-profit club successful and you will learn more about the operations
of the organization. <BR>

<BR>

A few of the volunteer opportunities awaiting your involvement are: <BR>

<BR>

<B>
Special Activities - </B>Plan an outing; design and print flyers; 
help with planning parties for Halloween, Christmas, Valentines; 
man the Special Activities table during meetings to sell t-shirts;
organize a happy hour or movie night. (Call Ken Jacquin to volunteer.)
<BR>

<BR>

<B>
Programs (Monthly meetings) - </B>Volunteer for crowd control during 
monthly meetings; help secure door prizes or give a door prize; 
take pictures; help set up speakers/suggest topics; help with set up or 
clean up. (Call Carter Rowles to volunteer) <BR>

<BR>

<B>
Newsletter - </B>Write an article; take photos during a club activity; 
help distribute newsletters when needed. Call Phil Rowe to volunteer.) <BR>

<BR>

<B>
Membership - </B>Volunteer to check in members and guests at the 
membership table; help get estimates on the member directory; 
help greet guests and new members at meetings. 
(Call Janice Kaczmarek to volunteer.) <BR>

<BR>

Publicity - </B>Distribute club posters or club brochures to 
athletic clubs, hair salons, grocery stores, sporting good stores, etc. 
Help answer the club hotline. (Call Charlene Gilley to volunteer.) <BR>

<BR>

<B>
Trip Planning - </B>Serve on the committee that will research and 
make decisions on trips for the 1997-98 ski season. The committee usually 
meets once or twice a month from January to May. This experience is very 
valuable for those interested in serving as a trip chair or assistant
trip chair. (Call John Pierce to volunteer) <BR>

<BR>

<B>
Trips - </B>Help at a sign up table in the fall. Also, keep in mind - 
Anyone can help during an Austin Skiers' trip. Work with the trip chair 
to plan a happy hour or activity during the week; volunteer to host or 
help with a pre trip or post trip party. The opportunities are endless.
(Call Kent Wick or a trip chair to volunteer.) <BR>

<BR>

Volunteering is a great way to make an impact on this club. 
If you ever wondered how club officers or trip chairs are nominated 
or picked - it is because they were a volunteer or helped in some way 
first. We need your help so please give us a call. <BR>

<BR>

&quot;Support our sponsors. They support us.&quot;</I> <BR>

on the Horizon<BR>

</FONT>By Ken Jacquin, V.P. Activities</B></H4>

<P>
My goal as &quot;Fun V.P.&quot; is to set up events that have an 
appeal to as many members as possible. If I can get sufficient help 
from other members, I will try to set up two events per month during 
non-ski trip months. I hope everyone can find something of interest in
the events below. If you know of an event you would like to see on the
calendar, or if you can help with any of these below, call me at
345-7997. <BR>

<BR>

The cost for all of these activities are paid by the participants, 
so some charges are required. <BR>

<BR>

Happy Hours for July are at Pearls Oyster bar. <BR>

<BR>

July 20 Aqua Fest Raft Race - Chuck Tysor at 258-5181 is commander of this 
event. He needs helpers to build the raft. Only helpers will be allowed 
to ride the raft during the Aqua Fest. Please call Chuck and help out - 
this is a great way to have some fun and to advertise the Club. <BR>

<BR>

July 27 Bike ride at Dripping Springs. This will be a morning 
ride of about 10 miles on a beautiful country road that runs parallel 
to and criss-crosses Onion Creek. After the ride we have a tailgate 
party with breakfast tacos, etc. Call Ken Jacquin at 345-7997 or Patti
Carey at 451-9702 to get details and to reserve a spot. There will be a
small charge (approximately $1 - $2) to cover the food cost. <BR>

&quot;The Cave Without a Name.&quot; We will all meet at the &quot;Y&quot; 
in Oak Hill at 1:30 p.m. and caravan to the Cave (about 75 miles). The 
cave tour will take a little over an hour. We will then travel to Boerne
(about 20 minutes) where we will have dinner at the Country Spirit
Restaurant and then adjourn to do whatever we wish in Boerne. The cost
of the cave tour is $5 per person; cost for dinner is whatever you
order. Call Ken Jacquin at 345-7997 to reserve a spot and get more
information. <BR>

<BR>

Aug. 23 Friday night dive at Aquarena Springs. We are 
limited to 12 lucky people who will get to enter these beautiful springs 
through the &quot;actor's entrance&quot; which is through the floor of 
a floating building. Exotic species you could see include Talapia,
albino catfish, freshwater prawns the size of big lobsters, freshwater
eels, and an endangered salamander. The cost will be from $27 to $30
depending on how many people go. Call Angie Coleman at 892 -7699 to get
details and reserve a spot. <BR>

<P>We are pleased that you are considering joining Boy Scout Troop 49.  It
is our hope that you will find your Scouting experience with our Troop a 
rewarding and most of all fun experience in which to continue or begin your Scouting experience.

<P>We have an active camping program, attempting to camp one weekend out of each month and to schedule as many varied camping locations and experiences as possible throughout the year.  There will be backpacking campouts and full gear campouts.  We try to have at least one and sometimes two family campouts during the year, when your whole family is invited and encouraged to join us for a weekend out of doors.

<P>We are working toward our goal of Troop meetings planned by and for the Scouts, not adult leaders.  This is your Troop and your responsibility to run it as you feel will allow all of you to meet and exceed the scouting ideals.  A Patrol Leader's Council made up of Scouts takes the lead in planning and executing our Troop program.

<P>It is our hope that your parents will join our troop!  We have a variety of areas in which we need and would appreciate their participation.  We have a Troop Committee made up of parents and other adults that meets monthly to discuss and finalize plans for scouting events, campouts, facilitate transportation and fundraising necessary to help our troop go and support the plans made by the Patrol Leader's Council.  All parents are invited to join the Troop Committee.  We encourage parents to consider a leadership role in which they can best use their talents and skills (i.e., Scoutmaster, Assistant Scoutmaster, Committee Chair, Secretary, Treasurer, Fundraising, Advancement, Activities Chairs, Transportation, Merit Badge Counselors...).  We have found that in most cases the Scouts who have parents who take an active role in the Troop's leadership are the Scouts who make a strong commitment to and get the most of of their Scouting experience.

<H3>My Current Scouter Jobs</H3>

<P>
I am a Unit Commissioner in the 
<A href="longhorn.htm">Longhorn District</A>, 
<A href="cachome.htm">Capitol Area Council</A>, 
B.S.A. serving one post, one pack and two troops. 
<P>
In case you don't know what a Unit Commissioner
does, in a nutshell, we are here to be coaches, advisors and facilitators
to help unit Scouters deliver a quality program to their Scouts.
<P>
Unit Commissioners are resources for information about B.S.A, Council, 
District and other Scout program issues that affect Scouters. 
<P>
Unit Commissioners are volunteers
who don't have the desire or authority to tell anyone how to run
any part of their program. 
<P>
Everyone needs a friend or sounding
board who can sometime help them address the challenges of being
a Scout Leader.  
<P>
I am Committee Chairman for the new high adventure <A href="e49home.htm">Explorer Post 49</A> which is looking for new members among both male and female young adults.
<P>
As a Committee Member in <A href="t49home.htm">Troop 49</A>, I am 
responsible for publishing the quarterly Troop Newsletter and various 
other tasks.
<P>  
<IMG alt="old goat patrol patch" src="./gifs/oldgoatp.gif" align=middle>
Troop 49's Scouter Patrol is known as the Old Goats. 
<P>
I'm General Chairman for the Longhorn District Camporee '97 which will be held in January.
<P>
I have also volunteered my time and resources to serve as WebMaster
for the Boy Scout information made available on the 
<A href="http://www.main.org">Metropolitan
Austin Information Network</A> (MAIN), a non-profit community network.

<H3>All About I</H3>

<P>
I have held many positions in <A href="c49home.htm"> Pack </A>, 
<A href="t49home.htm"> Troop </A> and 
<A href="longhorn.htm"> District </A>. 
<P>
I have completed many Scouter training courses. 
I am working my Wood Badge ticket right now (I used to be an Owl). 
<P>
I have attended summer camp sessions at Osceola (H. Roe Bartle
Scout Reservation, Missouri), 
<A href="lpsr.htm">Lost Pines Scout Reservation</A> and
Wehinahpay Mountain Camp (New Mexico).  I've been on many overnight 
campouts, hikes and backpacks.
<P>
I served as Area Director and merit badge counselor for Citizenship in the 
Nation at the first-ever Lost Pines Winter Camp in December of 1995. 
<P>
I was Vice-Chairman for Longhorn District Camporee '96.
<P>
I am an Ordeal member of the 
<A href="oa99.htm">Tonkawa Lodge</A>, Order of the Arrow. 
<P>
As a youth, to the best of my sometimes dim recollection, I achieved Webelo 
and First Class ranks.  Due to a reorganization, I was a Scout in both the 
Thunderbird and Tonka Districts of the Kansas City Area Council.  Since
then, KCAC was merged into the Heart of America Council.

<P>Mexican Free-tailed Bat.  The largest urban bat colony in the United States resides under 
Congress Avenue bridge in Austin, the State Capitol, from spring to fall.  This scenic spot on Town Lake, a part of the Colorado River, is frequented by bat gawkers around dusk each evening when the bats leave their roost for their nightly foray.  Some nights the swarm of bats is so large that it shows up on the airport and weather radars.  Other bat colonies, including at least one larger than that in Austin, reside in caves and abandoned tunnels throughout the state.

Houston's Texian army which defeated Mexican General Santa Anna at the 
<A href="http://www.lsjunction.com/events/jacinto.htm"> Battle of San Jacinto </A>.  
Some say that the star represented the wish of many 
Texians to achieve statehood.  Whatever the original intent, the flag of the 
Republic of Texas was adopted  January 25, 1836 as shown here and has been used to symbolize
the Lone Star State ever since.  Unlike most state flags, the Texas flag may 
be flown on a separate pole at the same height as (but to the left of) the 
U.S. flag in token of its status as the emblem of a former sovereign nation.

arrived in Texas hunting mammoth, giant bison and other animals.
<LI>after 6,000 B.C.  -- The beginning of the Archaic Period of the Texas Native Americans, 
best known for the beautiful murals depicting human scenes, animals and religious 
ceremonies painted on cave walls and still surviving in dry areas of West Texas.
<LI>from 500 A.D. to 1500 A.D.  -- The Late Prehistoric Period in Texas.  Agricultural

<LI>1519  -- The Spanish explorer Pineda made a map of the Texas coast, an event considered to begin the rule of Spain in Texas.
<LI>1528  -- Cabeza de Vaca was shipwrecked near Galveston.  His small band met many Native American tribes while wandering through the Texas area, but he finally made his way to Spanish settlements telling tales of the fabled "Seven Cities of Gold."
<LI>early 1540's  -- Coronado and his men explored parts of present day New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas looking for the seven cities and strengthening Spain's claim on the region.
<LI>1682  -- Corpus Christi de la Isleta, established near El Paso, became the first Spanish mission and pueblo in Texas.

<LI>1823  -- Stephen F. Austin organized the first group of Texas Rangers to protect against Native American attacks.
<LI>January to September of 1835  -- Led by Stephen F. Austin and many others, Anglo-American and Hispanic citizens of Texas began their efforts to achieve freedom from Mexico.  Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, the President of Mexico, reinforced his troops in Texas.
<LI>October 2, 1835  -- A battle fought at Gonzales, in which the Mexican forces failed in their efforts to retrieve a cannon, is generally considerd to be the first battle for Texas Independence.  The battle also gave rise to a famous Texas flag, depicting a single star, a cannon and bearing the words "Come and Take It."
<LI>October 17, 1835  -- The Texas Rangers were formally organized.
<LI>March 2, 1836   -- The <A href="http://www.lsjunction.com/docs/tdoi.htm">
Texas Declaration of Independence</A> was enacted at Washington-on-the-Brazos.
<LI>March 6, 1836  -- The Battle of the Alamo, lasting nearly two weeks, ended with the deaths of nearly all its Texan defenders, including David Crockett, Jim Bowie and William B. Travis, at the hands of Santa Anna's Mexican army.

<P>President Houston called out Texas forces under the command of General Alexander Somervell.  When the Mexicans beat them to the Rio Grande, Somervell refused to follow across without specific orders.</P>   

<P>Some of the Texans elected W.S. Fisher as their leader, crossed the river and assaulted the town of Mier demanding tribute.  The town was reinforced by the Mexican army while the Texans sat outside waiting for a reply.  When the Texans finally attacked, they were repulsed and captured.</P> 

<P>The prisoners were marched overland to Mexico City and placed in Perote Prison.  They escaped, but most were recaptured or killed.  The prison commander was ordered to execute all 176 Texan prisoners, but he refused.  The sentence was reduced to decimation (executing 1 in 10).  176 beans, including 17 black ones, were placed in a jar and the prisoners drew to determine who would die.  Those drawing the black beans were immediately executed.  It is sometimes reported that one unattached Texas traded his white bean for the black bean of a married comrade with children.  This is probably just a bit of good folklore.</P> 

<P>The rest of the prisoners remained in prison until freed at the request of European and U.S. governments. </P> </LI>

<h2><font face="Arial"><a name="guides"><b><i>Guidelines</i></b></a></font ></h2>

<p><font size=3 ><strong>Each hiker carries his own gear, his share of
provisions, water and group gear (stoves, fuel, pots, cleaning
items, tents, etc.).</strong></font ></p>

<p><font size=3 ><strong>Each hiker participates in meal preparation and
cleanup.</strong></font ></p>

<p><font size=3 ><strong>Each hiker leaves no trace of where he&#146;s
been or camped, stays on trails, and packs out everything that he
brought in, especially trash. Be careful when cooking and
don&#146;t make a mess. Use biodegradable camp suds. Scatter
waste water broadly and at least 200 feet from any water source.</strong></font ></p>

<p><font size=3 ><strong>Total weight that a hiker should carry will be
between 1/4 and 1/3 of his normal body weight (around 20 to 30
pounds including food, water and group gear).</strong></font ></p>

<p><font size=3 ><strong>Hang up food, garbage and utensils at night. No
cooking, food or flames in or near tents.</strong></font ></p>

<h2><img src="./gifs/backpckr.gif" align=middle>
<font face="Arial"><a name="hints"><b><i>Hints and Tips</i></b></a></font ></h2>

<p><font size=3 ><strong>BE PREPARED -- Plan ahead, develop your menu
and buy your food well in advance of the outing. Assign specific
duties. Decide who brings and/or carries what group gear.</strong></font ></p>

<p><font size=3 ><strong>Try out new gear and ideas at home before you
hit the trail. Especially be sure your stove is working, whether
old or new and that you have everything to set up your tent. Also
check that the tent seams are sealed and it has no holes in it.</strong></font ></p>

<p><font size=3 ><strong>Keep your foods simple, nutritious,
lightweight, nonperishable and tasty. A rule of thumb is two pounds
of food per person per day. Always plan at least one special
treat.</strong></font ></p>

<p><font size=3 ><strong>Pack things in labeled small bags (ziplocs are
great). Put related collections of small bags in labeled larger
bags. For instance, a bag each for breakfast, lunch , dinner and
snacks. Or a bag for toiletries and another for each change of clothes.
Use a large heavy plastic bag (such as a trash compactor bag) to
line your backpack.</strong></font ></p>

<p><font size=3 ><strong>Take a lot of small snacks in addition to your
meals such as trail mix, breakfast bars, kudos, graham crackers,
cookies. Apples and oranges are great but heavy, so only take one
or two of each.</strong></font ></p>

<p><font size=3 ><strong>See the packing list below.
Don&#146;t take anything extra unless you decide it would be essential
for an emergency, which means its not really extra. Consider
sharing items with your buddy or patrol members. Take out the optional
items first if your backpack is too heavy.</strong></font ></p>

<p><font size=3 ><strong>Leave your class A uniforms and clean underwear
in a bag in the vehicles and change into them for the trip home.
No need to pack these in to the campsite.</strong></font ></p>

<p><font size=3 ><strong>Wear hiking boots or other sturdy shoes,
preferably already broken in.</strong></font ></p>

<p><font size=3 ><strong>Study chapters 2, 4 5, 7, 9, 13 and 15 of
the Boy Scout Handbook for good information.</strong></font ></p>

<p><font size=3 ><strong>Pack layers of clothing that you can put on or
take off as your level of activity or the weather changes. Cotton
is not a good choice for any of your clothing.</strong></font ></p>

<p><font size=3 ><strong>Coffee filters and water purification
tablets are a cheap and lightweight alternative to water filters.</strong></font ></p>

<p><font size=3 ><strong>A Scout is Cheerful, Thrifty, Helpful, Brave,
Clean, etc. Live by the Oath, the Law, the Motto and the Outdoor
Code whenever you are in the backcountry.</strong></font ></p>

<h2> <a name="pack"> <b>Sample Packing List</b></a></h2>

<strong>
<p>You can use this form to plan what goes into your backpack.  Fill it out in pencil so you can easily make changes.</p>

<p>Put a <em>T</em> in the Take column for items you wish to take.  Draw a line through all three columns for items you don't want to take.</p>

<P>For the items you want to take, place an <em>H</em> in the Have column if you have the item in your possesion and ready to pack. If not, put a <em>B</em> in the Have column to indicate that you need to buy, beg or borrow this item.</P>

<P>Once you have an item, put a <em>P</em> in the Pack column when you place the item in your pack.  If you are going to share all or part of an item with a buddy or your patrol, you could put an <em>S</em> in the Pack column.</p>

<P>Everyone has an opinion about what you should or shouldn't take, so I haven't attempted to solve that conundrum for you, even though some items are listed in an Essentials group while others are shown in an Optional group.  This doesn't mean that all the other items must be taken, or may be left at home.   I do suggest that you 

<UL>
<LI>plan carefully, adding extra items that you really want and subtracting out everything that you don't want 
<LI>plan for the extremes of weather you may encounter
<LI>don't exceed your weight limit, share everything you can and take out optional items first if your pack is too heavy
<LI>take this form with you so you can indicate what things you did or didn't use and what things you would have used if only they had been in your pack.
</UL>

<P>The lighter your pack, the more fun you will have carrying it.</P>

<p><b>There is a battle of significant consequence taking place in the lives of youth in America today.  In simple terms, it is the struggle between doing <em>RIGHT</em> or <em>WRONG</em>.</b></p>

<p><b>A study conducted by Louis Harris & Associates indicates that <em>the proportion of boys in America today choosing to do what is wrong is alarmingly high</em>.  Even basic values such as honesty and showing common respect for others seem to be the exception rather than the rule.</b></p>

<p><b>Another disturbing revelation is that the boy's outlook on the world is rather dim.  <em>Fewer thatn one-third (32 percent) are satisfied with the world today.</em></b></p>

<p><b>The study indicates that the morals and values of American men often fall below the ideal:</b></p>

<ul>
<LI><b>Only <em>62 percent</em> strongly agree that "a person should not resort to a means that he or she knows is wrong, even though it may lead to success."</b>
<LI><b>Only <em>38 percent</em> strongly agree that "helping others should come before one's own interests."</b>
<LI><b>One of four <em>(25 percent)</em> strongly agree that "being honest with everyone is not something that pays off in the kind of world we live in."</b>
<LI><b>More than one-third <em>(35 percent)</em> do not classify "Not declaring all of one's income to the IRS" as "absolutely wrong."</b>
<LI><b>Almost four of ten <em>(37 percent)</em> do not classify "Keeping excess change given at a store" as "absolutely wrong."</b>
</ul>

<B><P>From among these men and boys will come the role models for future generations.</b></p>

<p><b><u>Ethical Controversies</u></b>, B.S.A. No. 23-823,<b> combines with the <B><U>Explorer Leaders Handbook</u></b>, to provide the outline for Ethics in Action in Exploring.  The key components of this Exploring program are:</b></p>

<DL>
<DT><B>Learning Through Experiences</B>
<DD>Young people need experiences that allow them to:
<OL align=center>
<LI>Interact with peers and acquire a sense of belonging
<LI>Gain experiences in decision making
<LI>Discuss conflicting values and formulate their own value system
<LI>Reflect on self in relation to others and discover more about themselves by interaction
<LI>Experiment with their own identity
<LI>Participate as a responsible member of a group
<LI>Cultivate a capacity to enjoy life
</OL>
</DD>

<DT><B>Problem-Solving Skills</B>
<DD>The way young people learn to reason about and solve promlems and make choices will stay with them the rest of their lives.  Empathy, invention and selection are the three step problem solving method taught in Exploring.  Initiative games and constructive controversy exercises are ways of teaching leadership skills and problem solving.
</DD>

<DT><B>Ethics Forum</B>
<DD>By inviting one or more persons to speak to the post about ethical problems in a particular field of interest, such as the post's specialty area, Explorers can use the information gathered to create their own constructive controversies.
</DD>

<DT><B>Reflection</B>
<DD>Reflection is a way of reviewing experiences once they are over to understand what happened and how to apply this understanding to future experiences.  Used with initiative or cooperative games, reflections will start becoming a commonplace ending to many activities.
</DD>

It shows how caring adults can make a difference in the lives of young people.  The training outline that comes with the video structures a one and a half hour workshop for adult leaders.</B></P>

<h2><b>The Value of Scouting</b></h2>

<p><b>Does Scouting offer more than fun in the outdoors?  The answer found in the Harris study is a resounding YES!</b></p>

<p><b><em>More than eight of ten adult men (84 percent) who were Scouts as boys agree that "the values I learned in Scouting continue to be very important to me."</em></b></p>

<p><b>The study results indicate that <em>Scouts with five years tenure are more likely than non-Scouts to</em>: </b></p>

<UL>
<LI>Assume a leadership role in clubs or school organizations
<LI>Put the needs of others before themselves
<LI>Make the most honest, not the easiest, decisions
<LI>Value education and the environment.
</UL>

<p><b>Nearly 9 out of 10 of today's BSA youth members believe that Scouting has taught them to:</b></p>

<UL>
<LI type=block>Take better care of the environment
<LI type=block>Get along with others
<LI type=block>Always give their best effort
<LI type=block>Have self-confidence
<LI type=block>Care for other people
<LI type=block>Set goals
<LI type=block>Treat others with respect.
</UL>

<p><b><em>Men who were Scouts for five or more years as boys are more likely than men with no Scouting experience to</em>: </b></p>

<UL>
<LI type=circle>Graduate from high school (98 percent versus 83 percent)
<LI type=circle>Graduate from college (40 percent versus 16 percent)
<LI type=circle>Earn annual household incomes of over $50,000 (33 percent versus 17 percent).
</ul>

<p><b>Scouting gives parents an opportunity to provide their children with a safe, structured, nurturing environment that fosters the initiative to learn and discover, while instilling strong values and morals.</b></p>

<p><b>Scouting encourages children to achieve a deeper appreciation of others in their communities, including peers, parents and other adults.</b></p>

<p><b>Scouting provides youth with a sense that they are important as individuals.</b></p>

<p><b>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Scouting promotes activities that lead to personal responsibility and high self-esteem.  As a result, when hard decisions have been made, a youth can look in the mirror and be proud of the person seen.</b></p>

<P>We welcome Boy Scout Troop 3 (Longhorn District) to our Capitol 
Area Council/Troop 49 WebSite on MAIN.  We have moved the 
<I>Districts and Units</I> from the Council 
Home page to a page of their own.  A new pointer to Boy Scout Troop 28 
(our first Arrowhead District unit on the Web) has been added.  Due to
requests received at the Commissioner's College, the full Council
Training Calendar for August, 1995 through August, 1996 has been added to 
the Council Calendar.  This should be of benefit to those looking for 
training in districts other than their own.

<P>Well, we made it through an ice storm and four days of freezing weather. 
In the midst of that, we actually had a real snowfall for the first time in
eleven years.  Today's high is predicted to be in the upper 70's.  For those
of you who haven't heard it, there's an old saying in these parts:  
<B><I>If you don't like the weather in Texas, just wait a bit and 
it will change.</I></B>

<P>Many thanks to all of the Scouts and Scouters who have complimented us on 
our site recently.  Pats on the back are good food for the soul.  As I write 
this, freezing rain is outside our window and expected to last for three 
days.  When we have weather like this, my sympathies are aroused for our
more northerly neighbors.  I hope everyone has a safe, warm and happy 
weekend.

<H2><A NAME="tiger">Tiger Cubs B.S.A.</A></H2> 

<P><IMG SRC=".\gifs\tigrcubs.gif" align=bottom>Tiger Cubs is a program for boys in the first grade and their adult partners.  It allows the boy and adult to build strong relationships with each other, the rest of the family, and with other members of the Tiger Cub's Den as they <I>"Search, Discover and Share"</I> together.  

<P>The main emphasis of Tiger Cubs is fun for a boy and adult, but many of the activities are suitable for participation by the rest of the family as well.  The program is built around seventeen different themes, called "big ideas."  These include "Know Your Community," "Fitness and Sports," "Prepare for Emergencies," and "Family Entertainment."

<P>Four to eight boy-adult teams make up a Tiger Cub Den.  Each boy-adult team shares in Den leadership.  Den activities are home-centered with the family using the big ideas.  Den activities are held twice monthly.

<P>Tiger Cub Dens meet with the Pack at monthly Pack meetings and special events such as pinewood or space derbies, raingutter regattas, the annual blue and gold banquet, Tiger Cub graduation ceremonies and other times as planned by the Pack.

<P>Each Tiger Cub Den is part of a Cub Scout Pack.  The Pack selects a Tiger Cub Coach (not a member of the Tiger Den) who completes Fast Start and Basic Training.  The coach is responsible for communication with and support of the Tiger Cub Den until graduation into Cub Scouting.

<P>Basic literature for the Tiger Cub program includes:
<OL>
<LI><I>Family Activity Book </I> used by the boy and adult, and a packet of materials included with the book -- two iron-on decals for the uniform, an activity chart, activity stickers, and "Tiger Track" recognitions; 
<LI><I>Tiger Cub Resource Book</I> with program helps for the "big ideas";
<LI><I>Tiger Cub Guidebook</I> used by council, district and Pack leaders;
<LI><I>Welcome to Tiger Cubs, BSA</I>, video No. AV-01V010;
<LI><I>Tiger Cubs, Yeah!</I>, video No. AV-01V005 for recruiting.

<P>The purpose of the Boy Scouts of America as incorporated on February 8, 1910, and chartered by Congress in June 1916, is to provide for boys and young adults an effective educational program designed to build desirable qualities of character;  to train in the responsibilities of participating citizenship; and to develop personal fitness.  Through chartered organizations, Cub Scouting provides a year-round, home centered program that has helped to strengthen families since 1930.

<P>In Cub Scouting, boys, families, leaders, and chartered organizations work together to achieve the following objectives:
<UL>
<LI>Influence a boy's <B>character development</B> and <B>spiritual growth.</B>
<LI>Develop <B>habits and attitudes of good citizenship.</B>
<LI>Encourage <B>good sportsmanship</B> and pride in growing <B>strong in mind and body.</B>
<LI>Improve <B>understanding within the family.</B>
<LI>Strengthen a boy's ability to <B>get along with others.</B>
<LI>Foster a sense of personal achievement by <B>developing new interests and skills.</B>
<LI>Provide <B>fun</B> and <B>exciting new things to do.</B>
<LI>Show a boy how to be helpful and <B>do his best.</B>
<LI><B>Prepare him to be a Boy Scout.</B>
</UL>

<P>Wolf (2nd grade), Bear (3rd grade), and Webelos (4th and 5th grade) Dens usually meet weekly in the Den Leader's home and then gather monthly with the Pack to show off their skills, receive advancement recognitions and to participate in special events like pinewood or space derbies, raingutter regattas, the annual blue and gold banquet, graduation ceremonies or other events planned by the Pack.  Webelos Scout graduation to Boy Scouting is recommended in February or March, while other graduations usually take place at the end of the school year in May or June.

<P>Three Cub Scout Advancement Videos may be used to give boys an opportunity to see the action, experience the adventure, and learn the skills of Cub Scouting.  They supplement each Cub Scout program book and can be used by boys and families in the home, during den activities and in the classroom.  If not available in the Pack library, they may be checked out from the Council Service Center.

<H2><A NAME="sports&academics">Cub Scout Sports and Academics</A></H2> 

<P>Cub Scout packs promote physical fitness and sportsmanship through participation in twenty individual and team sports.

<P>An academics component provides opportunities for Cub and Webelos Scouts to become more proficient in eight subjects.  This program encourages a boy to <I>do his best</I> while involving a parent whenever possible.

<P>Both Sports and Academics programs allow Cub and Webelos Scouts to pursue a group learning process in the den, pack, or community.  Each program also allows Cub and Webelos Scouts to pursue  an individual learning process working with an adult.  Either way, they have fun while learning.

<P><I>Belt loops</I> are awarded by the pack to Cub and Webelos Scouts for participating in each sport or academic subject.

<P><I>Recognition pins</I> are available for Cub Scouts, Webelos Scouts and their adult teammates in each sport or academic subject.  To qualify, participants must earn sixty points during any three month period.  One point is earned for every thirty minutes of activity in the sport or academic subject. 

<P>B.S.A. publishes an individual manual for each sport or academic subject.  Information for pack leaders is provided in the <I>Leader Guide -- Cub Scout Sports and Academics</I>,  No. 34295 and in the <I>Cub Scout Leader Book</I>, No. 33220.

<H2><A NAME="family">The B.S.A. Family Program</A></H2> 

<P>Scouting makes available to packs resources that can help today's families accomplish worthy goals while building and strengthening relationships among family members.

<P>The <I>Cub Scout Leader Book</I>, No. 33220, outlines special parents' meetings.  During those meetings, parents can draw support from each other and share their successes in enhancing family life.  These quarterly parents' meetings are hosted by the pack committee.

<P>The <I>BSA Family Book</I>, No. 33012, gives parents a host of ideas to help bring their families together through "family talks" and other activities designed to enhance the children's personal development and enrich the family environment.

<P>Family pins are available to adults and family patches to Cub and Webelos Scouts for participation in the program.

<H2><A NAME="rel">Religious Awareness</A></H2> 

<P>Many religious-faith groups have programs of intensive religious education for individual Cub or Webelos Scouts.  Religious emblems are designed to recognize Cub Scouts who demonstrate faith, observe the creeds or principles of the faith, and give service.  Religious emblems are not Scouting awards;  they are presented by religious groups to boys who earn them.

<P>Cub or Webelos Scouts may earn an emblem whether or not they are members of a pack operated by a religious organization.  The intent of the program is to encourage the Cub or Webelos Scout to work directly with his own religious leader or, in some cases, a layperson designated by that religious leader.

<P>Requirements for each religious emblem are determined by the religious body.  Student and counselor manuals are available from the Council Service Center.

<H2><A NAME="ethics">Ethics in Action</A></H2> 

<P>Cub and Webelos Scouts are growing up in a complicated world where they are subject to many influences, many of which are negative and in conflict with the values that their parents are trying to help them learn.  Ethics in Action activities are designed to reinforce those values, including honesty, fairness, respect for others, and maintenance of a healthy self.

<P>Detailed instructions for conducting each of the Ethics in Action activities, as well as a complete explanation of the values education process, are included in the latest printing of the <I>Cub Scout Leader How-to Book</I>, No. 33831.

<P>Ethics in Action activities have been included in both Cub and Webelos Scout den meeting recommendations in the <I>Cub Scout and Webelos Scout Program Helps</I>, and in the <I>Cub Scout Roundtable Planning Guide</I>.

<P>Cub Scouting happens in the den.  The National Den Award will create an incentive for a year-round fun, quality program in the den.  The National Den Award may be earned only once in any twelve-month period.  The period (charter year, calendar year, school year, etc.) is to be determined by the pack committee.

<P>Requirements may be found in the <I>Cub Scout Leader Book</I>, No. 33220.

<B>Camping Opportunities for Cub Scouts, Webelos Scouts, Parents and Families</B>

<P>Camping and outdoor activities fulfill a Cub Scout's dreams of fun, excitement and adventure.  They provide a natural setting for quality time with family and friends.  Camping satisfies young men's curiousity about the pioneering way of life in America.  Modern council camps, with qualified leadership, provide an ideal setting for these activities.

<P>Check with the Council Service Center or your Unit Commissioner for information on Cub Scout outdoor events and opportunities available in the Council.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="daycamp">Cub Scout Day Camp</A></H3> 

<P>Day camp is an accredited, organized, one to five day program for Cub and Webelos Scouts under certified leadership at an approved site.  It is usually held during daylight or early evening hours, but not overnight.  Den members are supervised by den and pack leaders.  Councils may add a Webelos Scout and parent overnighter at the end of day camp.

<P>In the Capitol Area Council, each district usually runs one or more sessions of Cub Scout Day Camp during June.  Members of one district may attend the day camps held by other districts if desired.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="fcamp">B.S.A. Family Camping</A></H3> 

<P>In Scouting, family camping is defined as an outdoor camping experience, other than resident camping, that involves Scouting program elements in overnight settings with two or more family members, including at least one BSA member of that family.

<P>There are two types of B.S.A. Family Camping:
<UL>
<LI>recreational family camping
<LI>program-managed family camping.
</UL>
Both are conducted on council-owned or operated property. but differ in the amount of program and support offered.

<P>Families of Cub Scouts that go camping on their own, outside of organized B.S.A. family camping opportunities and at facilities not owned or operated by the B.S.A., should be aware that while these activities are fun and rewarding, they are not covered by the B.S.A.'s liability insurance.

<P>Capitol Area Council provides spaces for recreational family camping at Lost Pines Scout Reservation and other council owned camps.  Program-managed family camping opportunities vary in the Council.  Detailed information about  both types of family camping may be obtained from your Unit Commissioner or the Council Service Center.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="res">Resident Camping</A></H3> 

<P>Resident camping is an organized, accredited overnight camping program covering at least two nights and conducted under certified leadership in an established Scout camp operated by the councild during the normal camping season.  Cub Scouts, Webelos Scouts and parents participate with den and pack leaders in a theme-related outdoor program.

<P><B>Resident Camping includes these Outdoor Program Areas:</B>
<UL>
<LI>Showmanship
<LI>Sportsmanship
<LI>Craftsmanship
<LI>Waterfront
<LI>Fitness
<LI>Campcraft
<LI>Nature
</UL>
<P>Each year councils change their overall theme to provide different adventures.  Themes include:
<UL>
<LI>Sea Adventure
<LI>Space Adventure
<LI>Athletes
<LI>Knights
<LI>Indians and Pioneers
<LI>Folklore
<LI>The World Around Us.
</UL>

<P>Capitol Area Council conducts Cub and Webelos Scout Resident Camping sessions at the Horse Center in Dripping Springs beginning in June of each year.  For more details, check with your Unit Commissioner or the Council Service Center.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="weboc">Webelos Den Overnight Camping</A></H3> 

<P>Webelos Scout and parent overnighters introduce the boy and his parent to the camping program, under the leadership of the Webelos den leader.  In most cases, the Webelos Scout will be under the supervision of his father or mother.  However, if a parent can't attend, then arrangements must be made by the boy's family for another youth's parents (but <I>not</I> the Webelos leader) or another adult relative or friend to be a parent substitute on the campout.  It is essential that each Webelos Scout be under the supervision of an adult.  Each adult may supervise no more than five Webelos Scouts.  Joint Webelos den-troop campouts are encouraged for dens of fifth-grade Webelos Scouts with their parents to strengthen ties between the pack and troop.  Webelos dens are encourage to have several overnights a year.

<P>Guidelines for planning the Webelos overnight campouts are found in Chapter 6 of the <I>Cub Scout Leader Book</I>, No. 33220, and in <I>Webelos Den-Troop Joint Overnighter</I>, No. 13-007.  Many potential campsites suitable for Webelos Den Overnight Camping exist in the Capitol Area Council.  If you need some ideas, contact your Unit Commissioner or the Council Service Center.

<strong><P>
The following is a set of rules for conducting a Pinewood Derby.  They
have been used for <A HREF="c49home.htm">Pack 49</A> races and similar rules 
have been used for <A HREF="longhorn.htm">Longhorn District</A> races.  
<P>
Be sure to organize enough adults (a.k.a. Race Officials) to run the 
event.  Den Chiefs and other Boy Scouts can be great help, especially 
as judges for design and craftsmanship. Brief them on their duties 
ahead of time.  
<P>
Get a track, draw up brackets, agree on the rules for an odd number of 
cars in a heat, publish all the rules and get prizes ready for 
participation, heat, design and craftsmanship winners in advance of 
the race.  
<P>
We usually have a pre-inspection for cars during the week before the 
race.  At minimum, plan to start inspections well before race time 
on the day of the race to allow for last minute modifications.  
<P>
Be sure to have a scale and other equipment for inspection and fixing 
of cars.  A box of the correct exterior dimensions so that a car of 
maximum size fits into it will help you do fast inspections.  Your 
Scout Shop may stock copies of the Grand Prix Pinewood Derby book that 
covers building the box, track and more.  
<P>
Remember the focus of this event is not to win at any cost, but for 
each Cub Scout to <B>DO HIS BEST and HAVE FUN!</B>

<H2>GRAND PRIX PINEWOOD DERBY RULES FOR 1996</H2>
<H3>Cub Scout Pack 49 Race Committee</H3>
<strong><P>
The Cub Scout should have the fun of racing a car he has built from 
materials in the Pinewood Derby kit.  Adults and others should only 
guide and help.  We will run a separate race bracket for Wolf, Bear and 
Webelos scouts.  The fastest car in each bracket will run in a 
Championship bracket. Adults or Boy Scouts who wish to compete may buy 
their own derby kits and compete in a Non-Cub Only race bracket.  Also, 
we will judge cars for excellence in several design and craftsmanship 
areas.

The Non-Cub Only bracket is open to any Adult partners of these Scouts 
or any registered Scouter or Boy Scout from Pack 49 or Troop 49.
<P>
3.All brackets are double-elimination. This means that each car must 
lose twice before leaving the Derby.
<P>  
4.A car that jumps off the track or interferes with another car is moved 
to a different lane and the heat run again.  If it happens again, the 
car loses the heat.  
<P>
5.If a car breaks down, the scout is allowed five minutes to fix the 
car.  Then Officials will run the heat again.  If the car cannot be

<H3>Race Procedures</H3>
<strong><P>
1.Each Scout must bring his car to the Inspection Table.  If the car 
fails to meet any rules, the Inspectors tell the scout the exact 
problems.  The Scout may change the car to meet the rules.

Scorers set-up and maintain the race brackets and tell the Official 
Starters which cars run in each heat.
<P>
3.After registration, Scouts place their cars on the Starters' Table.  
Scouts may not handle their car again unless:
<UL>
<LI>getting the car for the start of a heat, or

place their cars at the start, then go to the finish line to watch the 
heat.
<P>
5.The car whose nose is first over the finish line is the winner.  If 
two of the three Official Judges can't agree on a winner, Officials 
will run the heat again.  Judges tell the Official Scorers which car 
wins each heat.
<P>
6.Officials present racing awards at the end of each bracket.  Design 
awards are presented after the Championship bracket.  Last, we run the 
Non-Cub Only bracket.

</H2>

<P>
All Leaders, Scouts and their parents are requested to attend
the Troop Planning Meeting on Saturday, August 5th, 10:00 a.m.

the Troop needs more planning, better organization and different
activities. Now is your chance to contribute those ideas to developing
our Troop Program through August of 1996. Now is your chance to
suggest your favorite places to go, things to do, exciting opportunities
for events and adventures. Some suggestions have been surveying,
rock climbing, caving, rappelling, canoeing, whitewater rafting,
backpacking, hiking, sailing, Bear Creek, Choke Canyon, Lake Somerville,
Garner State Park, a food drive, returning to Wehinahpay and Lost
Pines for summer camp, Philmont, Guadalupe Mountain National Park,
Mustang Island, popcorn sales, ScoutExpo ticket sales, etc. Come
add yours to this list and help select twelve months of Troop
activities. If you have them, bring your sports, school or church
calendars along too.

August 25/26/27 are the dates for the next Troop Campout at Guadalupe
River State Park. The park is on a beautiful section of the river
with fishing, tubing and swimming opportunities. They also have
a new mountain bike trail and historical sites/exhibits. Those
working on hiking can plan a good 10 miler. More details will
be announced at the August Troop meetings. Scoutmaster Jim B.
assures everyone that we will not earn our Polar Bear patch at
Guadalupe River as some of us did the last time the Troop camped
there.

<H2>Galveston Island Campout</H2>

<P>
In May, Troop 49 went surf fishing and swimming at Galveston Island
State Park. Reports from the tour leader included good fun despite
some logistical problems and a trashed out Scout room in the aftermath.
Many thanks to Bill G. for leading and driving an overloaded
van for the Scouts who went.
<H2><A NAME="junecoh">June Court of Honor</A></H2>

<P>
Brad C. organized and emceed a great Court of Honor for
Troop 49 on June 20. This provided a service to the Troop and
fulfilled one of his requirements for the Communications Merit
Badge. A special presentation at this Court was made to Bill G.,
who received his Wood Badge beads for successfully completing
the Wood Badge coursework and service requirements. A host of
rank and merit badge awards were recognized for our Scouts. Congratulations
to you all! Many thanks to the Troop families who contributed
to the potlatch dinner.<A NAME="wehinahpayadv"></A>

<H2>Wehinahpay Mountain Camp Adventure </H2>

<H3>by Bill G., David K. and Jerry W.</H3>

<P>
Saturday morning, we should have left later because we arrived
at Hobbs too early. The first night out, at the Days Inn, was
a bit rough. Almost all the Scouts had wanderlust and required
corralling until after dark. Thankfully, Hobbs had a 10:00 p.m.
curfew for teenagers. Many watched the HBO late-late-late show
that Saturday night and Sunday morning. The next leg of the trip
was a great deal quieter, while the Scouts caught up on missed
sleep.
<P>
Camp check-in and orientation went smoothly on Sunday afternoon.
The climate and the scenery were spectacular and the camp facilities
impressive. First day climbing and climbing and climbing left
several of the Scouts and leaders exhausted. We were at about
8,000 feet, which is higher than airplanes fly around Austin.
Daytime was warm (not hot or humid) but the evening and night
was cold enough for nice sleeping. Sunday evening we spent at
the opening campfire, a very entertaining, very cold, and somewhat
overlong event.
<P>
Monday would bring the first cases of altitude sickness and dehydration.
Bill G. had a tough first day in camp turning in paperwork
at the courses for the Scouts that were in the Medic's. He got
to hike about ten miles. In his spare time, there were the changes
in schedule requests by seemingly every Scout. Luckily for him,
the other leaders had some energy left on Monday evening, and
the Scouts were also tired, so he went to bed at 7:30 P.M. The
weather was dry enough to make the trails really dusty. We saw
Zac climbing the mountain in the midst of a cloud of dirt more
than once.
<P>
Every day we varied the elevation probably another 1,000 foot
hiking up and down mountains to our campsite, dining hall, trading
post, lake and activity areas. We may have hiked 5 to 6 miles
per day and felt the effects of the thin air by the time we hiked
back up to our campsite. We were winded and feeling the strain
in our legs. If a person did that every day for a month, they
would have some awesome legs and lungs.
<P>
Tuesday brought more altitude sickness and dehydration, but everyone
was out of the Medic's and back on the trail by 1:00 p.m. except
Charlie. Ali had gotten a good long rest while visiting with the
Medic in Training. Mike drove Charlie into Cloudcroft to see a
doctor for his toe. From this point on, except for Charlie's infected
toe and Will's sprained ankle, Troop 49 had no other need for
emergency care. The C.O.P.E. participants enjoyed the team building
&amp; adventure program, Packy continued to work toward rank,
and the other Scouts continued their course work. Packy and Scott
were participants in an open-air Board of Review for their Tenderfoot
and Second Class ranks. Mike left in the afternoon to run an errand
and returned at supper with a wild story about being bushwhacked
by bears. Tuesday evening, the Troop played volleyball.
<P>
Finally things began to settle into a routine. This gave us a
chance to start working on projects aimed at earning points toward
Honor Patrols and Honor Troop. Due to a lapse of common sense,
Erik, Daniel, Will, Andrew S. and Ali were selected to spearhead
the camp service project. The Camp Commissioner suggested cleaning
a brush pile off the mountain above the Wehinahpay Cafe and below
our Cochise Campsite. This project was integrated with the camp
improvement projects, constructing a table and a camp sign tripod.
All Scouts participated in these events, but special recognition
to the Mooses for the brush removal, and James, Nick, Ryan, and
Packy for construction work.
<P>
On Wednesday, a common sight was Charlie hopping around camp with
his crutches. He made the long trip over to C.O.P.E. and hopped
tables for dinner. Wednesday was also the day we got to clean
the showers. The Troop's evening activities included a trip to
the Mountain Man camp for sawing, hatchet throwing, and road kill
stew and cobbler. Wednesday night was also the West side campfire.
The Moose Patrol's skit was &quot;Bearly Alive&quot; and the Cobras
did &quot;Cappie, the Caterpillar.&quot; Songs from Troop 49 were
&quot;Dead Dog Rover&quot; and &quot;Little Piece of Tin.&quot;
James was a great emcee and Eric got wet.
<P>
The C.O.P.E. course was a lot of fun for Charlie &quot;Snoopy&quot;
B., Aaron &quot;Airwalk&quot; K., Eric &quot;Tormented by
Yawning Bunny&quot; R. (Yawning Bunny was their counselor),
Ryan &quot;Apocalypse&quot; W., Nick &quot;Nickelodeon&quot;
R. and David &quot;Ankar&quot; K. It was great for all
of us. We learned trust, expanded paradigms, expanding our senses,
communication, team work, companionship, helpfulness, bravery
plus we laughed a lot and had great fun. The first day, we walked
around (in a human connected train) blindfolded for about an hour
over rocks, gravel, holes, tall grass, through branches, up and
down steps, under fences, etc. We were guided by the great Wowser
who could only expel gas or wretch for communication. The guy
in front had a stick (blind man's cane) and everyone got a chance
to be the leader. The next day we were given physical problems
to solve that took team work and group thinking to complete. Wednesday
was high course day (30 feet off the ground) which was loads of
fun! Thursday was the trust fall. You stood on a 5 foot platform
with your back to everyone, fell backwards (straight as a board)
and trusted your team mates to catch you! Friday was climbing
the tower (like rock climbing) and rappelling. A great experience
for all!
<P>
On Thursday, basket weaving and chapped lips seemed to be everywhere
you looked. Andrew B. had lips so chapped he looked as if someone
had hit him. The evening flag retreat was executed by Troop 49,
and all Scouts, sans hoppers, participated in the ceremony under
the able leadership of James. After dinner, we visited the Indian
Village for leg wrestling, game playing, tomahawk throwing and
fry bread. Ryan and Eric did very well at leg wrestling, leading
to many repeated efforts.
<P>
Friday dawned with many Scouts having some badges completed and
other courses requiring a last minute push to complete requirements.
In the morning, there seemed to be a larger than average fishing
crowd at the lake. The Moose Patrol, Nick, Eric and Bill G.
spent the dry half of an otherwise wet Friday catching and cleaning
our limit of trout at the lake. At about noon, the sky opened
and the rains came. Clearing began about 3:00 PM, but mud replaced
dust for the remainder of our camp stay.
<P>
The closing campfire Friday night was a win-win-win situation
for Troop 49. James B. took the First Archery prize (Gold Arrow),
with Eric R. taking Second (Yellow Arrow) and Erik W. Third
(Red Arrow). Erik received special mention for having shot with
the bow duct taped to his cast. The John Wayne Rifle prize (Top
Scout Score) went to Charlie B. The C.O.P.E. participants
received beads and certificates. The Moose and Cobra Patrols received
Honor Patrol Awards. The Cobra Patrol consisting of Ryan W.,
Scott C., Erik W., Nick R., Eric R. and Packy
T. was led to Honors by Acting Patrol Leader Charlie B.
The Moose Patrol consisting of Ali V., Andrew S., Andrew
B., Zac A. and Will G. was led to Honors by Daniel
R. Finally, Troop 49 was among six troops receiving Top
Troop recognition. Leading our Troop to Honors were Aaron K.,
Senior Patrol Leader and James B., Acting Assistant Senior
Patrol Leader.
<P>
On Saturday, we packed up and left camp by 9:00 a.m. The trip
to Carlsbad Caverns was great, a nice treat after a camp well
done. James and Erik conversed with some of the local populace
in both Artesia and the Caverns. Ryan, Eric, and Jerry kept staring
at everything and bringing up the rear on the Caverns tour. We
then drove into Hobbs where most of us indulged ourselves in air
conditioning, showers, food and television. Those who skipped
the showers were reminded before being allowed in vehicles Sunday
morning.
<P>
The road was long and tiring, and all were ready for home when
we pulled into Austin about 6:30 PM Sunday evening. On Tuesday,
after we returned, James B. and Packy T. were recognized
as our Honor Campers for Wehinahpay Mountain Camp. They received
Coleman Lantern key chain lights as their prizes.

<P>
Adam S., with the help of several Scouts and Scouters,
has completed the work on his Eagle service project. All he has
left is the paperwork, a Scoutmaster Conference and an Eagle Board
of Review. Congratulations to Adam and all who assisted him. Let's
hope he will be the recipient of Troop 49's first Eagle Court
of Honor sometime this fall.

<I>by Walter Dudley Cavert</I>

<P>Dear Heavenly Father, help me to make honor the watchword of my life.  Above everything else may I place the integrity of my own soul.  Teach me that character is my most priceless possession.

<P>As I wear my Scout badge, may it remind me that I have taken a vow to be a person of honor.  Give me strength to be true to my promise.

<P>Lift my life above all sham and make-believe.  Give me a steadfast loyalty to the highest and best that I know.  May I have the courage to stand for what I believe to be right in your sight, no matter what others may say or do.  Keep me from violating my honor or selling my soul.

<P>May the example of Jesus be my guide.  Help me to remember that he cared more for your approval than for the praise or blame of men.  In Christ's name, <I>Amen.</I>
<HR>

<H3> <A NAME="mdtg"> My Duty to God </A> </H3>
<I>by Walter Dudley Cavert</I>

<P>Above all other duties, O God, may I place my duty to you.  Make me willing to put you first in my life.  May I seek to do your will instead of my own.  May nothing be able to turn me aside from what I believe to be right in your sight.

<P>Give me faith that you have a plan for your world and for each person in it.  Help me to discover your purpose for my life.  Then make me glad to follow it.

<P>Each day may I seek the guidance of your Holy Spirit.  Open my mind to your truth.  Fill my heart with your love.  Make my will steadfast to obey you.  May my hands and my feet be ready to serve you.

<P>If I do wrong, may I be sincerely sorry.  Give me the courage to ask your forgiveness.  Teach me to depend more on your strength and less on my own.  For Christ's sake, <I>Amen.</I>

<H3> <A NAME="asir"> A Scout is Reverent </A> </H3>
<I>by Walter Dudley Cavert</I>

<P>Grant, O God, that I may remember my Creator in the days of my youth.  Each morning may I seek your guidance.  Each evening may I ask for your blessing.  Through the day may I have you as my companion and guide.

<P>Make me faithful in my duty to you.  Through prayer and the study of the Bible, lead me into an understanding of your will.  Make me glad to go to church to worship you.  In my daily life, may I show my love for you by loving my fellow men.

<P>May I be grateful for the privilege of living in a country where each person is free to worship according to his own conscience.  Give me respect for those whose religion is different from mine.  While I maintain a steadfast loyalty to my own church, may I defend the rights of others to worship as they please.  Grant that religious freedom may never mean religious neglect.

<P>Take my life into your keeping and make me a worthy follower of your Son, Jesus Christ. <I>Amen.</I>
<HR>

<H3> <A NAME="tfs"> Thanks for Scouting </A> </H3>
<I>adapted from an original written by Walter Dudley Cavert</I>

<P>We are thankful for the life of General Robert Baden-Powell and his work in starting the Scouting movement.  We are grateful that Scouting has given millions of youth a vision of what life at its best can mean.

<P>Grant blessings to all Scouts around the world and help them to be true to the Scout Oath and Law.

<P>Increase the number of adults who offer their lives as Scout leaders.  Let no one who wishes to be a member of Scouting miss the opportunity to join.

<P>Grant that Scouting may help to raise up in our world generations of citizens who will live by standards of honor and duty.  May they be able to save humanity from hate and greed, and lay the foundations for a world in which all people are held to be brothers or sisters.  In the name of the Master of All Scouts, <I>Amen.</I>

<P>The following material can be used with indicated adaptations for your event or as a guide to constructing your own chapel services.  Other sample worship orders and more ideas may be found in <I>Pathways To Worship</I> available from your Council Service Center.  Some hymnals contain similar material and cross references to scriptural or secular readings for specific topics.  Such reference materials should be part of the unit's library.  

<P>Any Boy Scout or Explorer, with a little guidance from an adult, should be readily able to construct and lead a Scouts' Own Service.  Involving the members of the patrol, troop or post in conducting the service helps to heighten interest for all participants.

<P>As with most Scouting activities, the most effective locale for chapel is usually in the outdoors.  A little Scouting around the area where you are camping will find a suitable, often impressive, spot for worship.

<P>O Father, whose voice I hear in the winds and whose breath gives life to all the world, hear me.<BR>
I am a man before you, one of your many children.<BR>
I am small and weak.<BR>
I need your strength and wisdom.<BR>
Let me walk in beauty and make my eyes ever behold the red and purple sunsets.<BR>
Make my hands respect the things you have made, my ears sharp to hear your voice.<BR>
Make me wise so that I may know the things you have taught my people -- the lessons you have hidden in every leaf and rock.<BR>
I seek strength, Father, not to be superior to my brothers, but to be able to fight my worst enemy, myself.<BR>
Make me ever ready to come to you with clean hands and straight eye, so that when life fades as the fading sunset, my spirit may come to you without shame.<BR>
<I>Amen</I>.

<P>Lord, make me an instrument of your peace,<BR>
Where there is hatred, let me sow love;<BR>
Where there is injury, pardon;<BR>
Where there is doubt, faith;<BR>
Where there is despair, hope;<BR>
Where there is darkness, light;<BR>
Where there is sadness, joy.

<P>O Divine Master,<BR>
Grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled, as to console;<BR>
To be understood, as to understand;<BR>
To be loved, as to love;<BR>
For it is in giving that we receive;<BR>
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned;<BR>
And it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.<BR>
<I>Amen</I>.

<H1>Aims and Methods of Scouting
<IMG SRC="gifs/cmpsrose.gif" ALIGN="middle"></H1>

<P>
<B>Scouting can be described as <I>"a fun game played by boys."</I></B>
<P>
<B>The Three Aims and Eight Methods make Scouting 
<I>"a game with a purpose."</I></B>

<P><IMG alt="greenbar" src="./gifs/greenbar.gif"><BR>

<H2>The Three Aims of Scouting</H2>
<P>
Aims are the basic outcomes Scouting seeks for each Scout.

<DL>
<DT><B>To build character</B>
<DD>To build self-reliance, self-discipline, self-confidence and
     self-respect
<DT><B>To foster citizenship</B>
<DD>To foster love of community, country and world, along with a
     commitment of service to others and an understanding of
     democratic principles.
<DT><B>To develop fitness</B>
<DD>To develop physical, mental, emotional, and moral fitness
     that will stay with a Scout for the rest of his life.
</DL>

<P><IMG alt="greenbar" src="./gifs/greenbar.gif"><BR>

<H2><A NAME="mthd">The Eight Methods of Scouting</A></H2>

<P>
Methods are how Scouting pursues the three Aims.

<DL>
<DT><B>Ideals</B>
<DD>Each Scout commits himself to the personal behavior guides
     and standards in the Scout motto, the slogan, the Oath and
     the Law
<DT><B>Patrols</B>
<DD>Patrols give Scouts experience in teamwork, democracy and
     leadership.
<DT><B>Outdoors</B>
<DD>Scouting emphasizes outdoors activities which foster an
     appreciation of nature and our ecology.  Along the way,
     Scouts practice and learn new skills and develop confidence
     in their own abilities to cope with obstacles.  Scouting is
     outing!
<DT><B>Advancement</B>
<DD>The advancement program provides Scouts with a ladder of
     skills to climb at his own pace.  On the way up, he has many
     opportunities to learn and to be recognized for his
     achievements.
<DT><B>Personal growth</B>
<DD>All of the other methods contribute to the personal growth
     of a Scout through experience.  The quest for growth is a
     method, too.
<DT><B>Adult association</B>
<DD>Adult leaders, male and female, provide an example to Scouts
     of the high character they should strive for in their
     personal growth.
<DT><B>Leadership development</B>
<DD>Making boys get leadership experiences is one of the most
     valuable things Scouting does.
<DT><B>Uniform</B>
<DD>The uniform reminds a Scout of who he is and what is
     expected of him.  It identifies him as part of a patrol,
     troop, council and worldwide youth movement.  He can take
     pride in being a Scout, and in the achievements shown on his
     uniform and sash.  Even neighborhood gangs recognize the
     importance of wearing a uniform, their colors.

The following is a checklist for &quot;Being prepared&quot; for
emergencies at the Troop, patrol or personal level. Think carefully
about duplications between kits, especially if you are backpacking.
Don't go overboard, share the essentials among the group. If you
don't have a trailer, some of the same items may need to be in
a vehicle.

<P>Each Scouting unit provides two adult leaders on all camping trips and 
tours, at least one of whom is 21 years of age or older and serves as Tour
leader in charge.  The Tour leader keeps the official tour or camp permit in
his possesion at all times in order to produce it when requested by Scouting
officials or other duly authorized persons.  In addition, the following 
promises are made by every unit regarding their performance for any local 
or national tour (one day trips, campouts, tours, etc.) when completing the 
tour permit application.
 
<B><OL>
<LI>We will use the <A href="#ssd">Safe Swim Defense</A> in any water 
activity. </B><I> See also <A href="#sa">Safety Afloat</A> for watercraft 
activities.</I>
<B>
<LI>We will use trucks only for transporting equipment - no passengers 
except in the cab.  All passenger cars, station wagons, recreational 
vehicles, and cabs of trucks will have a seat belt for each passenger.

<LI>We agree to enforce reasonable travel speed (in accordance with 
national, state and local laws) and use only vehicles that are in safe 
mechanical condition. </B><I>See also <A href="#it">Insurance and 
Transportation</A>.</I><B>

<LI>We will be certain that fires are attended at all times.

<LI>We will apply for a fire permit from local authorities in all areas 
where it is required.

<LI>We will at all times be a credit to the Boy Scouts of America and 
will not tolerate rowdyism or un-Scoutlike conduct, keeping a constant 
check on all members of our group.

<LI>We will maintain high standards of personal cleanliness and 
orderliness and will operate a clean and sanitary camp.

<LI>We will not litter or bury any trash, garbage, or tin cans.  
All rubbish that cannot be burned will be placed in a tote-litter bag and 
taken to the nearest recognized trash disposal or all the way home if 
necessary.

<LI>We will not deface trees, restrooms, or other objects with initials 
or writing.

<LI>We will respect the property of others and will not trespass.

<LI>We will not cut standing trees or shrubs without specific permission 
from the landowner or manager.

<LI>We will collect only souvenirs that are gifts to us or that we purchase.

<LI>We will pay our own way and not expect concessions or entertainment 
from any individual or group.

<LI>We will provide every member of our party an opportunity to attend 
religious services on the Sabbath.

<LI>We will observe the courtesy to write thank-you notes to persons who 
assisted us with our trip.

<LI>We will, in case of backcountry expedition, read and abide by the 
<A href="#wup">Wilderness Use Policy</A> of the BSA.

<LI>We will notify, in case of serious trouble, our local council service 
center, our parents, or other local contact.

<LI>If more than one vehicle is used to transport our group, we will 
establish rendezvous points at the start of each day and not attempt to 
have drivers closely follow the group vehicle in front of them.

<P>Leaders trained in Safe Swim Defense agree to use the eight defenses
in the plan on every occasion when their unit goes swimming.  Training

<P><B>As an adult leader, I promise to faithfully observe all the following
safety procedures as required in Safe Swim Defense.

<P>Leaders completing instruction in Safety Afloat agree to abide by these
defenses when giving leadership to an activity involving watercraft.

<B><OL>
<LI>Qualified Supervision.  A responsible adult must supervise all
activity afloat and must be experiend and qualified in water safety (BSA 
lifeguard or equivalent certification by a recognized agency) and in the
particular skills related to the watercraft being used, or use
assistants so qualified.  
<I>At least one adult must be certified in CPR.</I>

<LI>Physical Fitness.  All participants must be physically fit, and must
follow any special precautions required by physical limitations.

<LI>Swimming Ability.  Canoeists, sailors, water-skiers, rafters, and
boat operators must be swimmers.  Nonswimmers and/or beginners may ride as
passengers in a canoe, raft, or sailboat only if accompanied by an adult
certified lifesaver;  in a rowboat or motorboat with an adult swimmer.

<LI>Personal Flotation Equipment.  A properly fitted PFD must be worn
by all persons engaged in activity on the open water.

<LI>Buddy System. Always have a buddy and a buddy boat while afloat.

<LI>Skill Proficiency.  Everyone afloat must be trained and experienced in
handling and safety skills for the craft in use.

<LI>Planning.  Develop a "float plan" in advance and stick to it.  Know 
all state and local rules and follow them strictly.  Share your plan with
parents, unit committee, and local authorities as appropriate.  Check the 
weather forecast and keep an alert weather eye.  Anticipate emergencies
and be prepared.

<LI>Equipment.  Equipment must suit the craft, the water conditions, and
the individuals, and must always be in good repair.  Rescue gear must be
available.

<LI>Discipline.  Keep the fun from being interrupted by tragedy.  Know and
understand the rules and follow them carefully.

<H3>Insurance</H3>

<P>Although not required, it is recommended that each unit obtain and keep
in force a Unit Accident Insurance policy.

<B><P>All vehicles MUST be covered by a public liability and property damage
liability insurance policy.  The amount of this coverage must meet or exceed
the insurance requirement of the state in which the vehicle is licensed.
(It is recommended, however, that coverage limits are at least 
$50,000/$100,000/$50,000.)  Any vehicle carrying ten (10) or more passengers
is <I>required</I> to have limits of $100,000/500,000/$100,000.  In the case
of rented vehicles the requirement of coverage limits can be met by 
combining the limits of personal coverage carried by the driver with 
coverage carried by the owner of the rented vehicle.  All vehicles used in
travel outside the United States must carry a public liability and property
damage liability insurance policy that complies with or exceeds the 
requirements of that country.

<H2><A NAME="wup">Wilderness Use Policy</A></H2>

<B><P>All privately- or publicly-owned backcountry land and designated
wildernesses are included in the term "wilderness areas" in this policy.
The <A href="bsbasics.htm#outdoorcode">Outdoor Code</A> of the 
Boy Scouts of America applies to outdoor behavior
generally, but for treks into wilderness areas 
<A href="lowmpact.htm">no-trace camping</A> methods
must be used.  Within the outdoor program of the Boy Scouts of America,
there are many different camping skill levels.  Camping practices that are 
appropriate for day outings, long-term Scout camp, or short-term unit 
camping may not apply to wilderness areas.  Scouts and Explorers need to 
adopt attitudes and patterns of behavior, wherever they go, that respect
the rights of others, including future generations, to enjoy the outdoors.

<P>In wilderness areas, it is crucial to minimize our impact on particularly
fragile ecosystems such as mountains, lakes and streams, deserts and 
seashores.  Since our impact varies from one season of the year to the
next, it becomes important for us to adjust to these changing conditions as
well, to avoid damaging the environment.

<P>The Boy Scouts of America emphasizes these practices for all troops and
posts planning to use wilderness areas:

<UL>
<LI>Contact the landowner or land managing agency (Forest Service, National
Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
state, private, etc.) well in advance of the outing to learn the regulations
for that area and to obtain required permits and current maps.

<LI>Always obtain a tour permit, available through local council Scout 
service centers, meet all conditions specified, and carry it on the trip.

<LI>Limit the size of groups generally to no more than 8 to 11 persons,
including at least two registered adult leaders (maximum: 9 persons per
leader).  Do not exceed the group size established for some wilderness
areas.  Organize each group (patrol or crew) to function independently by
planning their own trips on different dates, serving their own food, 
providing their own transportation, securing individual permits, and camping
in a separate and distinct group.  When necessary to combine transportation
and planning or buying, small groups should still camp and travel on the 
trail separately from other groups of the same unit.

<LI>Match the ruggedness of high-adventure experiences to the skills, 
physical ability, and maturity of those taking part.  Save more rugged
treks for older youth members who are more proficient and experienced in
outdoor skills.

<LI>Participate in training for adult leaders on no-trace camping or be
proficient and experienced in the leadership and skills required for
treks into wilderness areas.

<LI>Conduct pretrip training for your group that stresses proper wilderness
behavior, rules, and skills for all of the potential conditions that may
be encountered.

<LI>Use backpacking stoves, particularly where the fuel supply is limited
or open fires are restricted.  Supervision by an adult knowledgeable in
the use of the stove(s) must be provided.  If a fire is necessary, keep it
as small as possible and use established fire lays where available if in a
safe area.  After use, erase all signs.

<LI>Emphasize the need for minimizing the impact on the land through proper
camping practices and preserving the solitude and quietness of remote
areas.  Camp at low-use areas -- avoid popular sites that show signs of
heavy use.

<LI>Leave dogs, radios, and tape players at home.

<LI>Use biodegradable (not metal or glass) or plastic food containers.  
Carry out unburnable trash of your own and any left by others.

<LI>Dig shallow holes for latrines and locate them at least 200 feet from
the nearest water source.  Cover the latrines completely before leaving.

<LI>Wash clothes, dishes, and bodies at least 200 feet away from any
source of natural water.

<LI>Where a choice is available, select equipment of muted colors that
blend with natural surroundings.

<LI>Look at and photograph;  never pick or collect.

<LI>Follow trail switchbacks and stay on established trails.

<LI>Treat wildlife with respect and take precautions to avoid dangerous
encounters with wildlife.  Leave snakes, bears, ground squirrels, and other
wildlife alone.

The Capitol Area Council, Boy Scouts of America, Requests the Honor 
Of Your Presence At <U>Every Home Football Game</U> of The University of Texas Longhorns in Their First Season in The Big 12 <P>
FREE!!!
</B>

<H2>HERE'S THE DEAL...</H2>

</CENTER>

This year we must have 150 Scouts in attendance serving as UT Ushers at each game.  There are only 6 home games this season.  <B>
<U>
Bottom Line:  It's Use  It or Lose It!</B></U>  This Year We've Added A Lot of Incentives:<P>

<OL>

<LI>
Each District has been assigned a specific number of UT Usher Scouts per Game.<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Each District will receive <B>
a signed football by the Longhorn Team and Staff</B> to be awarded to the Troop and/or scout Unit which has the best attendance overall for the season.  In addition, this Troop will receive a "1st Place" ribbon for their troop flag.  We will also award 2nd and 3rd place ribbons as well.<P>

<LI>
Scouts will be able to earn credit toward the following <B>
Eagle Requirement Merit Badges</B>:<P>

<OL>
<LI><I>Citizenship in the Community</I><P>

<LI><I>Sports</I><P>
</OL>

<LI>
</I>Scouts will earn <B>
credit toward Service Projects and Leadership Hours</B> Needed!<P>

<LI>
Scouts can attend as many games as they wish to above their required game.  We will be establishing an <B>
Honor Usher Patrol</B>, who will be recognized at a Game and will serve for the 1997 Football season!!!<P>

<LI>
<B>
Webelos</B> (who must have an adult leader with them and have an assigned Boy Scout with them) can earn the majority of their <B>
Sportsman Activity Pin</B>, and the entire Football section.  In addition, the Webelos Unit who has the best overall season attendance will receive a <B>
tour of the UT Sports Area</B> (yet another requirement on the Sportsman Activity Pin!) 1 Webelos Unit per District.  <BR>

This is an excellent opportunity for our Webelos to become better acquainted with Boy Scout Troops in their District and get a glimpse of what Boy Scouts is all about.  A Suggestion:  Have each Boy Scout Troop adopt a Webelos Group, and have both in attendance at the assigned game.<P>
</UL>
<LI>
Remember 2 deep leadership is a must!  Scouts must have their adult leaders with them when checking in.  <B>
Check-In is 1 1/2 Hours Pre-Kick Off (1 Hr at the Latest!!!)</B><P>

<LI>
We will have <B>
Training for Scout Ushers</B> (date and time to be announced).<P>

<LI>
A Suggestion:  have one Scout serve as the Troop UT Usher Coordinator, who'll be responsible for the Scout Sign-in Sheet.  Have one adult in the Troop responsible for coordinating travel to and from the game for the Scouts.<P>

<LI>
Contact your District Commissioner to sign up now!  Your District Commissioner can answer questions and give you the UT home schedule to select the games of your choice!<P>

<TR>

<TD  valign=top>Loyal

<TD  valign=top>Reverent
<TD  valign=top>Remembering that being a UT Scout Usher is a privilege, and we are guests.  Being thankful for the opportunity of being a UT Scout Usher, helping to keep the UT Scout Usher Program intact.</TABLE>

Remember, these qualifications can count toward Rank Advancement (demonstrating the Scout Law in daily life) and other requirements, if a Scout puts a little thought into what he is doing and how to interpret what's required.<P>

All UT Honor Ushers will be acknowledged at the last game of the Season (A&amp;M) and will serve for the 1997 Fall Season.   More specific awards for this honor will be outlined later in the season.<P>

<TITLE>THE EAGLE SCOUT CHARGE OR CHALLENGE</TITLE>

The Eagle Scout
Charge or Challenge</H1>

<P>
No two Eagle Courts of Honor have to be alike.  Established Troops often
have their own traditions for conducting the Eagle Court. Basic scripts and 
suggestions are found in <U>Woods Wisdom</U>.  The 
"Charge" below is often used.  Although this text is sometimes referred 
to as the "Challenge", that particular term is more appropriately applied 
to another script, which I have added below the "Charge".  There's even
another form of "Challenge" used in some scripts, while other 
versions of the Eagle Court of Honor use both texts below.  
For more tips on attaining the Eagle rank, service projects, Boards of
Review and Courts of Honor, see the 
<A HREF="http://bsa.net/nc/t486/EAGLE/index.html"> Troop 486 Tips for 
Eagle Advisors</A> page and browse some of the other sites listed on our 
<A HREF="caclinks.htm"> Links to Neat Stuff</A> page.  Don't forget to
check out our <A HREF="nesa.htm">National Eagle Scout Association</A> page, 
too.
<P>
<IMG alt="bar" src="./gifs/redbar.gif"><BR>

<H2>The Eagle Scout Charge</H2> 
<P><B>
The foremost responsibility of an Eagle Scout is to live with
honor. To an Eagle Scout, honor is the foundation of all character.
He knows that &quot;A Scout is trustworthy&quot; is the very first
point of the Scout Law for good reason. An Eagle Scout lives honorably,
not only because honor is important to him but because of the
vital significance of the example he sets for other Scouts. Living
honorably reflects credit on his home, his church, his troop,
and his community. May the white of the Eagle badge remind you
to always live with honor.</B>
<P><B>
The second obligation of an Eagle Scout is loyalty. A Scout is
true to his family, Scout leaders, friends, school, and nation.
His loyalty to his troop and brother Scouts makes him pitch in
and carry his share of the load. All of these help to build the
loyalty which means devotion to community, to country, to one's
own ideals, and to God. Let the blue of the Eagle badge always
inspire your loyalty.</B>
<P><B>
The third obligation of the Eagle Scout is to be courageous. Courage
has always been a quality by which men measure themselves and
others. To a Scout, bravery means not only the courage to face
physical danger, but the determination to stand up for the right.
Trusting in God, with faith in his fellowman, he looks forward
to each day, seeking his share of the world's work to do. Let
the red in the Eagle badge remind you always of courage.</B>
<P><B>
The fourth obligation of an Eagle Scout is to be cheerful. To
remind the Eagle Scout to always wear a smile, the red, white,
and blue ribbon is attached to the scroll of the Second Class
Scout award, which has its ends turned up in a smile.</B>
<P><B>
The final responsibility of an Eagle Scout is service. The Eagle
Scout extends a helping hand to those who still toil up Scouting's
trail, just as others helped him in his climb to the Eagle. The
performance of the daily Good Turn takes on a new meaning when
he enters a more adult life continuing service to others. The
Eagle stands as protector of the weak and helpless. He aids and
comforts the unfortunate and the oppressed. He upholds the rights
of others while defending his own. He will always &quot;Be Prepared&quot;
to put forth his best.</B> 
<P><B>
You deserve much credit for having achieved
Scouting's highest award. But wear your award with humility, ever
mindful that the Eagle Scout is looked up to as an example. May
the Scout Oath and the Scout Law be your guide for tomorrow and
onward.</B>
<P>
<IMG alt="bar" src="./gifs/whitebar.gif"><BR>

<H2>The Eagle Scout Challenge</H2> 
<P><B>
Your conduct along the trail has been excellent.    You  have
rededicated  yourself  to the principles of Scouting, but one
more thing is important:  Your future.
<P>
As an Eagle Scout, you become a  guide  to  other  Scouts  of
lower  rank.    You  become  an  example  in  your community.
Remember that your actions are now a little more  conspicuous
and  people  will  expect  more  of  you.   To falter in your
responsibility would not only reflect upon you, but  on  your
fellow  Eagles  and all Scouting.  The torch you carry is not
only yours, but is ours also.
<P>
____________________, I challenge you  to  enter  this  Eagle
brotherhood,  holding  ever  before you, without reservation,
the ideals of honor and service.   By the repetition  of  the
Eagle  Scout  Promise  before  your  fellow members, you will
become an Eagle Scout.  Though the words you use are  similar
to  those  by  which you joined Scouting, they will mean more
now than they could have meant at any time in the past.  When
you pledge yourself on your sacred honor, you will be sealing
your eternal loyalty to the code of the Eagle Scout, with the
words which closed the Declaration of Independence.    Scout,
parents,  and  guests,  please stand.   ____________________,
Scout sign.  Repeat after me:
<P>
I reaffirm my allegiance<BR>
to the  three  promises  of  the Scout  Oath<BR>
I thoughtfully recognize and take upon myself<BR>

<P><I><B>Picture, if you will, 10 people seriously immersed in the difficult task of fitting their teetering, clinging bodies on a two-foot square wooden platform.  

<P>Picture them, one by one, falling backward from a five-foot high platform into the waiting arms of their "team."  

<P>These two "low course" events are a small part of what happens in a COPE course experience -- 44 hours that change lives.  

<P>"Learning to COPE" will turn a diverse group of strangers into a closeknit, trusting team, able to support each other as they face their final COPE challenge -- to negotiate a series of challenges 30-50 feet above the ground.</B></I>
<HR>

<P>COPE has become synonymous with the terms "Ropes Course" or "Challenge Course" which stands for the process of applying fundamental learning principles through sequencing appropriate activities to facilitate group goals.  

<P>The program contains a variety of "low" elements which focus on problem solving and build trust, teamwork, communication, leadership and the ability to follow directions.  

<P>It also offers "high" elements which focus more on personal challenge, risk taking, anxiety, stress and group support.
<HR>

<P>COPE, a Boy Scouts of America developed program, is an educational process based on structured activities which use natural or artificial environments to identify individual and group intrapersonal strengths and weaknesses, and from this awareness promote positive personal growth.  

<P>Intrapersonal issues including self-concept and self-confidence, encompass social skills, communication, trust, problem solving, conflict resolution, cooperation, competition, leadership and followership.  These skills will be emphasized during <B>fun</B> adventure activities in an outdoor environment to create an important transfer of learning to the individual's daily work and social life.  The personal outcome of developing these skills is to enhance their self-esteem and self-confidence, allowing them to break through their own preconceived limitation and to achieve more than they think possible.
<HR>

<P>Since it's inception in 1988, the COPE course at 
<A HREF="lpsr.htm">Lost Pines Scout Reservation</A> has had over 3,000 participants, ranging in age from 14 (minimum age) to 72 years old.  In addition to Scout units from the Council, the staff of facilitators have worked with special needs groups, including physically and mentally handicapped, corporate groups, sport clubs, correctional institutions, and various other organizations and groups of individuals.
<HR>

<P>COPE provides an opportunity for each participant to achieve success as an individual and as a member of a team.  The activities are not designed to be competitive or to be a race against time.  More important 
<A HREF="#obj">objectives</A> including building individual confidence and developing leadership and a sense of common cooperation among team members are emphasized.  <B>The course is designed to build more self-confidence in a shorter length of time than anything most people have experienced.</B>
<HR>

<P>COPE challenges are increasingly more difficult requiring teamwork, communication, and problem-solving.  The team will share the stress, the excitement, the frustration, and the <B>fun</B> of each event.
<HR>

<P>A life-metaphor from the high course is that frequently in life, we face situations in which we experience fear;  the fear (of the unknown, of seeking a promotion, risking in some emotional way to change) can keep us from moving ahead and accomplishing our goals.  

<P>On the high course, the feeling (fear) is the same.  The climber can identify the feeling in a combination of symptoms -- dry mouth, rapid pulse, sweaty palms, weak knees, but he can also recognize that although the feeling is real, it is not accurate.  He is in safety gear and is in no physical danger.  The climber can experience choosing to move ahead through the fear and thus know the elation of accomplishing his goal in spite of the fear.  Next week, next month, next year, sometime in his life, the participant will face a life crisis and feel fear;  then he will remember that fear can precede positive change and increased self-esteem.  

<P><I><B>COPE is 44 hours of trust and teamwork, problem solving and communicating, sharing joy and fear</B></I>.  It is a mini-life-lab course to learn behaviors to effect change.

<A NAME="what"><H2>What is Exploring?</H2></A>

<P>Exploring is the young adult program of the Boy Scouts of America for 
young men and women ages 14 through 20.  The program is developed by 
local community organizations such as businesses, industries, professions, 
churches, and civic groups to match the interests of young adults with the 
program resources of the organization.  For example, a computer center could 
design an Explorer program in computers and invite Explorer-age youth 
interested in data processing to join.  Or a church might have a number of 
outdoor-minded adult members who could provide leadership and program help 
to an outdoor/High Adventure Explorer post.

<P>The program of the Boy Scouts of America is to provide young adults, 
through these community organizations, an effective Exploring program 
designed to build character, promote citizenship, and develop personal and 
mental fitness.  Each Explorer post has the responsibility of achieving 
this purpose by designing its own program around

<A NAME="info"><H2>Information for Explorers and their Parents</H2></A>

<P>Welcome to Exploring, a program of the Boy Scouts of America.

<P>There are over four million members of the Boy Scouts of 
America. The following information provides an overview of B.S.A. and the 
Exploring program.

<H3>The BSA and the Chartered Organization</H3> 

The Boy Scouts of America makes Exploring available to our nation's youth 
by chartering community organizations to operate 
Explorer posts. The chartered organization must provide an adequate and 
safe meeting place and capable adult leadership, 
and must adhere to the principles and policies of the BSA. The BSA local 
council provides unit leader training, program ideas, 
camping facilities, literature, professional guidance for volunteer 
leaders, and liability insurance protection.

<H3>Exploring's Volunteers</H3>

<P>Exploring's adult volunteers provide leadership at the post, district, 
council, and national levels. Many are parents of Explorers, 
or entered as youth members. Each chartered organization establishes a post 
committee, which operates its Explorer post, 
selects leadership, and provides support for a quality program. Some post 
committees depend on parents for membership.

<P>The post committee selects the Explorer Advisor, subject to approval of 
the head of the chartered organization or chartered 
organization representative. The post Advisor must be a good role model 
because Explorers' values and lives will be 
influenced by that leader. Parents need to know the post Advisor and 
should be involved in the post committee's 
activities so they can evaluate and help direct that influence.

<P>Exploring uses 
<A href="#6ea"> six experience areas </A> to promote character development, 
leadership development, and personal fitness for 
every member. Parents can help by encouraging perfect attendance, 
attending meetings for parents, and assisting when 
called upon by the Advisor.

<H3>Program Policies</H3>

<P>The Exploring program is flexible, but major departures from B.S.A. 
<A href="aimmthd.htm#mthd"> methods </A> and policies are not permitted. 
Explorers and their parents should be aware that:

<UL>

<LI>Leadership is restricted to qualified adults who subscribe to the 
<A href="scouting.htm#decl"> Declaration of Religious Principle</A>, 
<A href="#code"> the Explorer Code</A>, 
and the BSA <A href="scouting.htm#ldr"> Standards of Leadership</A>. 
Citizenship activities are encouraged, but partisan political activities 
are prohibited. 
Military training and drill are prohibited. Marksmanship, military career 
experiences, and elementary drill for ceremonies are permitted. 

<LI>The Boy Scouts of America recognizes the importance of religious faith 
and duty; it leaves religious instruction to the 
member's religious leaders and family. Members who do not belong to a 
post's religious chartered organization shall not be 
required to participate in its religious activities. 

<LI>Two registered adult leaders or one registered adult leader and a 
parent of a participant, who must be 21 years of age or 
older, are required on all trips and outings. If activities are 
coeducational, leaders of both sexes must be present. 
Parents and post leaders must work together to solve discipline problems. 
One-on-one activities between Explorers and adults are not permitted, 
except for authorized ride-along programs. 
Personal conferences must be conducted in plain view of others. 
If you suspect that anyone in the post is a victim of child abuse, 
immediately contact your council Scout executive, who is 
responsible for reporting this to the appropriate authorities. 
All Exploring activities are open to parental visitation. 

</UL>

<H3>Thank You!</H3>

<P>The Boy Scouts of America appreciates your taking time to become 
familiar with Exploring. We feel that informed Explorers 
and parents are strong allies in delivering the Scouting program. Help us 
keep the post program in accord with Exploring 
principles. Alert the post committee, chartered organization representative, 
and head of the chartered organization to any 
major deviations. And be prepared to do your fair share to support a 
quality post program.

LEADERSHIP SKILLS</H1></A>

<P>
<I>This material is copyrighted to Boy Scouts of America and provided 
solely for the use of B.S.A. members in conducting the Scouting
program.  The text was taken from the Explorer Leader's Handbook.  The same 
skills should be applied to leading any class, den, patrol, committee, 
pack, troop, team, crew or post.  Just adapt the language below to fit the 
group. These skills are taught in several Scout or Scouter leadership
training courses.  Minor variations from the source material were made for 
a better presentation on the WWW.</I>

<P>
Many years of experience in Exploring have shown that good leadership
is a result of the careful application of eleven skills  that
any post leader or officer can learn to use. With practice, these
skills can become a part of the adult's or youth officer's  leadership
style and will prove helpful in Exploring and all other leadership
situations:

UNDERSTANDING THE NEEDS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE POST
</H2></A>

<UL>
<LI>Each individual member of the group has certain needs and
characteristics.
<OL>
<LI>A leader should understand his or her own needs and characteristics.
<LI>A leader should understand the needs and characteristics of
each member of the group. This helps the leader to deal with 
each person as an individual, to treat that individual with respect,
and to help the person grow.
<LI>This understanding helps in planning the program and in getting
things done.
<LI>This understanding creates trust and builds confidence among

KNOWING AND USING THE RESOURCES OF THE GROUP</H2></A>

<UL>
<LI>Resources include all those things necessary to do a job.
Resources also include people, because people have knowledge 
and skills. Knowledge is what a person learns through familiarity
or experience-what you know. Skill is the ability to use what
 you know. Attitude includes the desire to do something-motivation-and
the belief that you can do it-confidence.
<LI>When the leader uses the knowledge and skills of group members
to get a job done, the members gain experience and  improve skills.
They also develop a positive attitude toward using a skill.
<UL>
<LI>Keep the post's program capability inventory up-to-date and
use it in planning.  
<LI>Understand the purpose and resources of your chartered organization.  
<LI>Survey the member's parents; include them in your program 
capability inventory.  
<LI>Find out your post member's skills, interests, and resources.

PLANNING</H2>
<P>
Planning is an important part of everything we do in Exploring.
The following is a simple process for planning:
<OL>
<LI>Consider the task and objectives. What do you want to accomplish?
<LI>Consider the resources-equipment, knowledge, skills, and attitudes.
<LI>Consider the alternatives. 
<UL>
<LI>Brainstorm.  
<LI>Reach a decision, evaluating each option.  
</UL>
<LI>Write the plan down and review it with the post.
<LI>Execute the plan.  
<LI>Evaluate the plan.

<A NAME="five">
<H2>5.<BR>
CONTROLLING GROUP PERFORMANCE</H2></A>

<P>
A leader influences the performance of the group and individual
members through his or her actions. Why is control needed?
<P>
A group needs control as an engine needs a throttle-to keep
it from running itself into the ground. A group works together
 best when everybody is headed in the same direction. If a plan
is to be properly carried out, someone must lead the effort.  Control
is a function that the group assigns to the leader to get the
job done. Control happens as a result of recognizing the difference
between where the group is and where the group is going. The leader
is responsible for developing a plan to help the group get to
its goal.
<P>
Setting the example is the most effective way of controlling
the group. When working with post members, do the following:
<UL>
<LI>Continually observe the group. 
<LI>Know what is happening and the attitude of the group.  
<LI>Make your instructions clear and pertinent.
<LI>Pitch in and help when necessary.  
<LI>Quickly deal with disruption.

EVALUATING</H2></A>

<P>
Evaluating helps measure the performance of a group in getting
a job done and working together. It suggests ways in which  the
group can improve its performance. There are two basic categories
of evaluation questions. After any event or activity,  ask these
questions:
<P>
<I>Getting the job done</I>
<UL>
<LI>Was the job done?  
<LI>Was the job done right?  
<LI>Was the job done on time? 
</UL>

<P><I>Keeping the group together:</I>
<UL>
<LI>Were relationships between group members helped or hurt? 

<LI>Was participation equally distributed among group members?
 
<LI>Did the group enjoy the activity?  
<LI>Did the group handle conflicts well?

SETTING THE EXAMPLE</H2></A>

<P>
Setting the example is probably the most important leadership
skill. It is the most effective way to show others the proper
 way to conduct themselves, and is even more effective than verbal
communication. Without this skill, all the other skills will 
be useless. One way to think about setting the example is to imagine
yourself as a member of a group and think about how  you would
like your leader to act.

SHARING LEADERSHIP</H2></A>

<UL>
<LI>While there are various ways to exercise leadership, the goal
of Exploring leadership is exemplified in a quote from the  ancient
Chinese philosopher, Lao-Tzu: &quot;But of a good leader...When
the work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say, 'We did  this
ourselves.'&quot;
<LI>The Exploring leader wants to give post members the skills
he or she possesses, not to use those skills in ways that keep
the  post weak or dependent. He or she offers leadership opportunities
to post members and teaches them the skills they need.

COUNSELING</H2></A>

<LI>To encourage or reassure  
<LI>To help an Explorer reach his or her potential

<UL>
<LI>Undecided-he or she can't make a decision  
<LI>Confused-he or she doesn't have enough information or has
too much information.  
<LI>Locked in-he or she doesn't know any alternatives. 
</UL>

<LI><B>How do you counsel?</B>
<OL>
<LI>First, try to understand the situation. Listen carefully.
Summarize. Check the facts. Paraphrase to make sure you  understand.
<LI>Second, help list as many options as possible.  
<LI>Third, help list the disadvantages of the options.  
<LI>Fourth, help list the advantages of the options.  
<LI>Finally, let the person decide on a solution. The counselor's
role is to give encouragement and information, not advice.

REPRESENTING THE GROUP</H2></A>

<DT><B><I>Where do you represent the post? </I></B>

<DD>Post leaders represent the post at post committee meetings,
Advisor's meetings, officers'  meetings, Explorer officers' association
(EOA) meetings, and planning conferences, and to the chartered
organization.

<DT><B><I>The leader represents the post in two situations:</I></B>
<DD><UL>
<LI>Without consultation- when he or she doesn't have the opportunity
to consult with post officers about a decision  
<LI>With consultation- when he or she can meet with post officers
about the issue 
</UL>
</DL>
<P>
In some cases the leader must represent the post's decision
exactly; in other cases, he or she must use independent judgment.
 You will need to solicit and analyze members' views and attempt
to represent those views within the guidelines of your post, 
your chartered organization, and Exploring.

<P>
The Troop has volunteered to participate in a Council Good Turn
project benefiting the Salvation Army Adult Rehabilitation Center.
On Sunday, October 22, the Troop and Pack 49 will distribute flyers
in our neighborhood. The flyers include instructions, a list of
needed items and information about the Salvation Army ARC program.
Needed items include: clothing, bedding, toys, tricycles, rugs,
furniture, radios, stoves, mattresses, refrigerators, bricabrac,
shoes, TV sets, bicycles, dishes and appliances. Donated clothing
should be left in bags at the front door for pickup. All other
items will be picked up by the Salvation Army after they are called
at 4160607. On Saturday, October 28, the Troop will pickup clothing
bags and return them to the church. Salvation Army personnel will
take it from there.

<H1><A NAME="nxtcampout">Next Troop Campout</A></H1>

<P>
November 10/12 will be a campout at Little Arkie's on the Blanco
River. Thirteen Scouts have indicated they wish to attend. A hiking
trail, tennis courts and other facilities are provided for a minimal
fee (to be announced at a Troop meeting). Adults are needed to
drive and spend the weekend. Contact Mike W., Outdoors and
Activities Chair, at 3455284 to volunteer.

Popcorn Order forms and sales kits were distributed to each Scout
on October 17. Orders must be turned in to either Wyman M.
or Robert R. no later than 5:00 p.m. on November 12. Popcorn
will be available for delivery starting November 29. Chocolate
covered popcorn will be an additional product offered this year.
In Councils that test marketed this new item, some units earned
as much as $5000. Lots of prizes can be earned by the Scouts for
their sales. A new commission structure will also return more
money to the Troop than in previous years. The Troop Committee
has decided that the first $500 in commissions go to the Troop
Treasury. Any additional commissions earned will be distributed
among the Scouts based on each one's percentage of total Troop
sales. This is a chance to earn some money for camp, equipment,
uniforms or whatever Scouting need a Scout may have.

<H1><A NAME="smokefree">BSA policy is smokefree</A></H1>

<P>
The BSA has long had policies which protect our members from being
exposed to alcohol or drugs while engaged in Scouting activities.
That protection has been extended to cover smoking. In order to
provide a smokefree environment for all Scouting participants,
a new policy states:
<P>
<I>&quot;All buildings or facilities under control of the local
council are to be designated as nonsmoking facilities. Smoking
outside entrance/exit doors is not permitted at any location.
In addition, all Scouting functions, meetings, or activities should
be conducted on a smokefree basis with permitted smoking areas
located away from all participants.&quot;</I>

<H1><A NAME="uniform">Giving a Uniform Salute</A></H1>

<P>
In the letters column of the October issue of Scouting magazine,
a question was asked about saluting, presenting or retiring the
colors while in Class B uniform. The response points out proper
procedures and states the BSA definition of uniforms:
<P>
<I>&quot;First of all, the BSA does </I>not<I> define uniforms
by the terms Class A or Class B, which are from the military.
The official (or field) Scout uniform is worn to formal Scouting
activities and public events, such as Courts of Honor, recognition
dinners, and parades. The activity uniform, for use when a high
level of physical activity is involved, consists of official pants
(long or short), appropriate official activity shirt (red for
all Scouts and Scouters, maroon or tan for Venture crew members)
or custom Scout shirt (camp, unit, special event, etc.), and official
olive socks.</I> 
<P>
<I>A Scout or Scouter in either uniform, wearing a cap or not,
renders the Scout salute to the flag during the pledge or playing
of the national anthem. Those in civilian clothes hold the right
hand (or remove and hold any head covering they are wearing) over
the heart.&quot;</I> 
<P>
The definition of official Scout uniform includes these items:
field shirt, olive pants (long or short), web belt with buckle,
cap, neckerchief with slide (or bolo), and olive socks (ankle,
midcalf or overcalf lengths). The activity uniform pants may be
the official tan activity shorts, olive shorts or olive long pants.
The official olive socks are now part of the activity uniform
in place of the plain white socks specified a few years ago. Also,
members of a colorguard are expected to wear their caps while
presenting the colors unless the presentation is part of a religious
event occurring within a place of worship.

<P>
Watershed events are those which define the boundaries between
phases of history, life or spiritual being. This month, I believe
such an event is occurring in our Charter organization. In the
First Cumberland Presbyterian Church Journal published October
4, the Pastor's Point began with &quot;Where there is no vision
the people perish&quot; from Proverbs 29:18. Roger R. is beginning
a project to get the congregation into a position to receive a
vision from God for ministry. One step in the project will be
an attempt to define needs in our city that might be addressed.
A product of the project will be a mission strategy for the congregation
which will &quot;help us to reach out to the community and to
the city with the Gospel of Christ.&quot; This effort brought
a question to my mind: Do you have a vision for community service
through your spiritual beliefs? In duty to God and Country Jerry

K., Jabe C., William C., Eric R., Daniel R.,
Ali V., Andrew S., Andrew B., Jimmy K., Will
G. and Packy T.. David K. was the tour leader. Sara
R., Wendell B. and Ken C. graciously volunteered
at the last minute to help with transportation and chaperonage
to make this trip happen. They all deserve a big pat on the back
for their efforts.

<P>
In August, Troop 49 held a family camp at Guadalupe River State Park.  
Emily W., Martha W. and Katie G. joined Sara R., Bill G., 
Jerry W. and Kinnon M. as the family contingent.  David R., James B., 
Jabe C., Brad C., Scott C., William C., Kinnon M., Zac A., Eric R., Will G.,
Packy T., Daniel R., Erik W. and Ali V. formed the Scout corps. The whole 
group participated in a hike into Honey Creek Nature Preserve for a program
on insects inhabiting the creek and its banks.  Catching and identification
of the bugs was great fun, especially with the help of the professional 
biologists and park volunteers who hosted the event. 
Some pioneering and Scoutcraft was accomplished by several of the Scouts.  
Everyone got to enjoy lots of swimming, floating and body surfing in the
river.  A few Scouts tried their hands at fishing too.  It didn't rain, so
the Troop 49 curse may be gone for good.

Wehinahpay Mountain Camp</A></H2>

<P>
Troop 49 is returning to the Sacramento Mountains (New Mexico)
June 16 through 22 for another session of summer camp. We liked
it so much the first time, we're going back for more merit badges,
C.O.P.E., fishing, Indian/mountain man lore, rifle/shotgun shooting,
archery, fresh air and vertical hiking. Some of our older Scouts
are discussing doing the backpacking trek in the surrounding Lincoln
National Forest. Space is limited, so get your $25 deposit submitted
a.s.a.p. but not later than January 23. To confirm our reservation
for Cochise, the same campsite we used last year, we have to send
in the deposits this month. The next payment of $50 per Scout
is due in March. The remaining $25 is due in April. Total cost
for the session will be $100 per Scout if paid in full by April
30, $105 if the balance is paid after that date. Adult Scouters
will need to pay $25 now and $25 in April. Travel costs ran about
$25 last year, not including food/souvenir expenses. Pay your
deposit and get your spot reserved now or you may miss out on
this trip.

Speaking of returning, Troop 49 is also going back to our local
Council summer camp June 30 through July 6 for, you guessed it,
merit badges, C.O.P.E., fishing, Indian lore, rifle/shotgun shooting,
archery, swimming, sailing and lots more. This year, we will be
staying in Kitchens campsite (near the Chapel, the waterfront
and the dining hall). Cost per Scout will be $120. The first $25
will be due sometime in early March. The remaining $95 will be
due near the end of May.

The Salesmanship Class set three goals:

<LI>$50.00 per person in sales for a total of $600.00 sales and
qualify everyone for a popcorn patch. ( and salesmanship badge)
<LI>$100.00 per person for a total of $1200.00 sales (this was
the one that most were shooting for)
<LI>Total sales of $1500 for the class.
</OL>

<P>
The class had two sales drives where they broke up into groups
of two and sold popcorn door to door around the church. Each night
we grossed over $400.00 and the Scouts gained a lot of experience.
Most of the class had never done this before and were very proud
of their effort. As for their goals, they met the $1500 total
at the last tally.
<P>
The class members were: James K., Ali V., William G.,
Aaron K., Matt S., Daniel R., Brad C., Andrew

<H2><A NAME="uni">Uniforming</A></H2>

<P>
One of the eight methods of Scouting is uniforming. The uniform
reminds a Scout of who he is and what is expected of him. It identifies
him as part of a patrol, troop, council and worldwide youth movement.
He can take pride in being a Scout, and in the achievements shown
on his uniform and sash. Even neighborhood gangs recognize the
importance of wearing a uniform, their colors. It is a tradition
in many Troops for Scouts and Scouters to show their pride by
wearing their uniforms all day long on February 8, the birthday
of Scouting in America. This year is the 86th anniversary of the
Boy Scouts of America.

A packed schedule of Eagle-required and elective merit badge classes
was supplemented with Eagle workshops and a campfire in the evenings.
Most Scouts had &quot;homework&quot; to do in the evening as well.
Apparently, some assignments got torched in the fire ring, too.
<P>
The rain was polite enough to wait for the last night after we

All Scouts and Scouters attending earned their Polar Bear patches
with the official announcement of 28 degrees on Friday morning.

Jerry W. served as Area Director for the Citizenship in the

Bryan H. and Aaron K. have been busy completing their Eagle

Aaron has turned in his packet to the Council Office, so an Eagle
Board of Review should be scheduled soon.

Jabe C. and Ryan W. are planning their service projects
and will soon be asking Troop members for help in getting them
done. Hours worked on an Eagle project can count towards the service
requirements for the lower ranks.
<P>
Late breaking news! Jabe's service project is to gather donated
bicycles, refurbish them and turn them over to Travis County Department
of Human Services East Rural Community Center. He has scheduled
January 27 and February 3 as days to work on the bikes. If all
goes well, February 10 will be the date for delivery to the Community
Center. Anyone wishing to help should contact Jabe.

Representative. He and Pastor Roger R. have just completed a
Chartered Organization Orientation session. They are looking forward
to working with us more closely in the future. Leslie was at our

January 19. Watch for future Recreation Nights and church events,
too.

Philmont Adventure Trek in '97</H2></A>
<P>
In the summer of 1997, Troop 49 will be going on a backpacking
adventure in Philmont. A crew of 10 Scouts will be doing some
of the most fun things they will ever do in Scouting. They will
be doing rock climbing, archaeology, blacksmithing, horseback
riding, mountain man, burro packing and lots, lots more in the
Cimarron Mountains of New Mexico. Come have an adventure!
<P>
Scouts must be at least age 14 by January 1, 1997 or have completed
the eighth grade before we leave for Philmont. The starting date
for our twelve day trek has not been confirmed, but we should
know by the end of May.
<P>
Cost per person will be $325 payable in three payments. <B>A $50
deposit is due in May 1996 to reserve your slot on the crew. </B>A
payment of $138 will be due in October and the remaining $137
will be due in May, 1977.
<P>
As this is an extended backpacking adventure in rugged country,
each Scout will need to be equipped with good hiking shoes, sleeping
bags and backpacks. Scouts accepted for the crew will also be
expected to engage in several pre-trip activities to get ready
for this ultimate experience. A maximum of ten slots are available
for Scouts, so get those deposits in immediately.

The $25 deposit was due in January. The second payment of $25
per Scout was due in March (if you haven't made it, get it in).
The remaining $60 is due in April. Total cost for the session

Murphy's Laws of Camping</A></H1>

<OL><B>
<LI>Any stone in a hiking boot migrates to the point of maximum
pressure.
<LI>The distance to a given camp site remains constant as twilight
approaches.
<LI>The number of mosquitoes at any given location is inversely
proportional to the amount of repellent that remains.
<LI><A NAME="4">The</A> probability of diarrhea increases with the square of 
the thistle content of the local vegetation.
<LI>Scout troops of the opposite sex are only encountered while
dealing with the diarrhea mentioned <A HREF="#4"> above</A>.
<LI>The area of level ground in the neighborhood tends to vanish
as the need to make camp becomes finite.
<LI>In a mummy bag the urgency of ones need to urinate is inversely
proportional to the amount of clothing worn.  It is also inversely
proportional to the temperature and the degree to which the mummy
bag is completely zipped up.
<LI>Waterproof clothing isn't.  (However, it is 100% effective
at containing sweat).
<LI>The width of backpack straps decreases with the distance hiked.
<IMG alt="*" src="./gifs/backpckr.gif"  align=bottom><BR>
 To compensate, the weight of the backpack increases.
<LI>Average temperature increases with the amount of clothing
brought.
<LI>Tent stakes come only in the quantity &quot;N-1&quot; where
N is the number of stakes necessary to stake down a tent.
<LI>Propane/butane tanks that are full when they are packed, will
unexplainably empty themselves before you can reach the campsite.
<LI>Given a chance, matches will find a way to get wet.
<LI>Your side of the tent is the side that leaks.
<LI>All foods assume a uniform taste, texture, and color when
freeze-dried.
<LI>Divide the number of servings by two when reading the directions
for reconstituting anything freeze-dried.
<LI>When reading the instructions of a pump-activated water filter,
&quot;hour&quot; should be substituted for &quot;minute&quot;
when reading the average quarts filtered per minute.
<LI>The weight in a backpack can never remain uniformly distributed.
<LI>All tree branches in a forest grow outward from their respective
trunks at exactly the height of your nose.  If you are male, tree
branches will also grow at groin height.
<LI>You will lose the little toothpick in your Swiss Army knife
as soon as you open the box.
<LI><A NAME="rain">Rain</A>. ('nuff said)
<LI>Enough dirt will get tracked into the tent on the first day
out, that you can grow the food you need for the rest of the trip
in rows between sleeping bags.
<LI>When camping in late fall or winter, your underwear will stay
at approximately 35.702 degrees Kelvin no matter how long you
keep it in your sleeping bag with you.
<LI>Bears. (see <A HREF="#rain">Rain</A>)
<LI>The sun sets three-and-a-half times faster than normal 
<IMG alt="*" src="./gifs/sunset.gif"  align=middle>
when you're trying to set up camp.
<LI>Tents never come apart as easily when you're leaving a site
as when you're trying to get them set up in the first place.
<LI>When planning to take time off of work/school for your camping
trip, always add an extra week, because when you get home from
your &quot;vacation&quot; you'll be too tired to go to back for
a week after.

<H2><A NAME="swap"> Badge Swapping</A></H2>

<P>Boy Scouts and Explorers attending jamborees may swap among themselves articles and novelties of a local or regional nature.  The swapping of such items as badges of office, rank, distinguished service, training, performance, achievement, and distinction, however, is a violation of article X of the Rules and Regulations of the Boy Scouts of America, forbidding the holding of these badges by any but the members who have complied with the requirements for them.

<H2><A NAME="words"> Words to Ponder for Collectors and Event Organizers</A></H2>

<P>Many Scouts collect patches and other Scouting souvenirs at conclaves, jamborees, camp and other Scouting functions.  Scouts enlarge their collections by swapping "doubles" or patches they no longer want.  Swapping is great fun if it is done right.  It gives you a chance to meet new friends as well as to improve your collection.  But swapping can be bad if the only goal is to beat other guys in a trade.

<P>If you are a patch collector, follow these guidelines:
<UL>
<LI>It is not in the spirit of Scouting to buy or sell patches.  Swapping is trading.  Do not buy or sell patches.
<LI>Don't spend so much time swapping that you miss out on all the other fun of the activities of the conclave.  After you "close a deal", be sure to exchange a friendly Scout handshake.
<LI>Exchange names and adresses with Scouts you swap with.  Write to them when you get home and make new friends.
</UL>

<P><B>It is the policy of the Area One Section Conclave that swapping and trading is done between one youth and another OR between one adult and another.  Trading and swapping is not to be done between Scouts and adults. </B>

<H2><A NAME="six">Texas Under Six Flags</A></H2>

<P><B>Texas under Spain:  1519-1685; 1690-1821.</B><BR>  
<IMG alt="flag of Spain" src="./gifs/sptxflg1.gif"  align=bottom>
Conquistadors and missionaries 
led the way into lands inhabited by Native Americans of many tribes.

<P><B>Texas under France:  1685-1690.</B><BR>  
<IMG alt="flag of France" src="./gifs/frtxflg2.gif"  align=bottom>
Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, 
explored the Texas coast and established a colony on the Sabine river, 
claiming the territory for France. Indians and disease took their toll 
in short order. France's short claim to Texas ended when the Spanish 
found and rescued the colony's survivors.

<P><B>Texas under Mexico:  1821-1836.</B><BR> 
<IMG alt="flag of Mexico" src="./gifs/mxtxflg3.gif"  align=bottom>
Mexico invited immigrants who were 
willing to follow Mexican laws, language, and religion to help settle the 
northern frontier. Stephen F. Austin established the first large colony 
of Americans in this new territory.  Settlers from Mexico, the 
United States, and Europe created a multi-cultural tradition that is still
strong in Texas today. 

<P><B>The Republic of Texas:  1836-1845.</B><BR>  
<IMG alt="flag of Texas" src="./gifs/texsflg4.gif"  align=bottom>
Following the Texas Revolution, the 
Republic was a flourishing frontier society that continued to attract 
immigrants. The fledgling nation fought to preserve its borders and protect
its growing population against threats from Mexico and Native Americans.  Cotton, soon to be called "King Cotton", began to be a major export, stimulating both farming communities and gulf coast seaports.

<P><B>Confederate Texas:  1861-1865. </B><BR> 
<IMG alt="flag of C.S.A." src="./gifs/cstxflg5.gif"  align=bottom>
Texas flew the Stars and Bars, produced war materials for the South and 
contributed her sons to the Confederate and Union armies. By the 
war's end, Texas suffered the loss of many of those brave sons, occupation
by military forces, and economic collapse. Some say the first battle of the 
Civil War occurred when Texans surrounded and captured the Federal armory 
housed in the Alamo, before the first shots were fired at Fort Sumter. 
Most historians agree that the last battle of the Civil War was fought near

<IMG alt="flag of U.S.A." src="./gifs/ustxflg6.gif"  align=bottom>
Before the Civil War, an 
industry based on Longhorn cattle began to take shape, leading to the 
eras of cowboys, cattle drives and the introduction of the "iron horse"--
the railroad. In 1901, an oil strike at Spindletop, in East Texas, 
brought the petro-chemical companies to the economic forefront. In turn,
they have been superceded by high-technology industries focusing on 
micro-chips, aerospace engineering, electronics manufacturing and much more.

<H2><A NAME="geo">Texas Geography</A></H2>

<P>The multi-cultural population of Texas has grown to make us the third 
most populous state of the United States.  Many of us celebrate our Anglo,
Hispanic, African, Asian or Native American roots and welcome the diversity 
and excitement they bring to our daily lives.  

<P>Spanish is spoken by many Texans, but a variety of other languages 
besides English can also be heard within our borders.

<P>Although many Texans profess their beliefs within Catholic or Baptist 
churches, nearly every manner of religious thought and fellowship is 
represented.

<P>There are three existing Native American reservations in Texas:  The Alabama-Coushatta in East Texas, the Tigua near El Paso and the Kickapoo in Maverick County.  Most Native Americans live outside reservations, however.  Texas' Native American population ranks ninth among the states, with approximately 42,000 residents.

<P>The bicameral (senate and house of representatives) Texas Legislature meets for its regular session in the spring of odd numbered years.  The governor may convene a special session for the legislators to address particular issues.  The governor of Texas is elected to a four year term in November of even-numbered, non-presidential election years.

<P>Texas has 254 counties.  Rockwall (147 square miles) is the smallest and Brewster (6,204 square miles) is the largest.  With more than 267,000 square miles, Texas contains about 7 percent of the total water and land area of the United States.  Texas is as large as all of New England, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Illinois combined.

<P>Miles and miles of Texas, the second largest of the United States, are 
crossed by highways connecting urban centers, farm lands, seaports, parks 
and recreational facilities.  At the widest points, north to south or east 
to west, Texas is about 800 miles across.

<P>Many famous Texans, including some former governors and Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston, are buried at the State Cemetary in Austin.  There are more than 700 local history museums, 35,000 archeological sites, and more than 1,100 sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Texas.

<P><IMG alt="coast" src="./gifs/coast.gif"  align=bottom>
Texas is flanked on the north by Oklahoma, on the east by a bit of Arkansas,
Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico, on the south by Mexico and on the west by
New Mexico.  The town of Isleta, one of the two oldest towns in Texas, was originally on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande until a change in the river's course made it a part of Texas.

<P>West Texas Mountains, with more than 90 peaks over a mile high, contain 
two national parks and other attractions. Guadalupe Peak is the highest 
point in the state at 8,751 feet above sea level.

<P>
<A HREF="#top">
<IMG alt="Go to" src="./gifs/go-top-b.gif" align=middle>Top</A>

<P>Texas Forests, mainly in East Texas, comprise over 23.4 million acres 
providing timber, recreation and critical habitat including four national 
forests and one national preserve.

<P>Wide-open prairies and plains promote livestock and farming.  Some say 
they also give Texans a love for lots of elbow room.

<P>624 miles of coastline on the Gulf of Mexico is dotted with islands, 
beaches, fishing piers, boat docks, natural preserves, oil rigs and seaports.  Over 600 historic shipwrecks are also located in the tidewater coastline.

<P> 
6,300 square miles of lakes, rivers and streams in Texas 
<IMG alt="rafting" src="./gifs/rafting.gif"  align=bottom>
provide hydro-electric power and water for urban areas or agriculture.  They 
also present many opportunities for fishing, boating and other recreational 
activities.  The largest body of water completely within the boundaries of Texas is Sam Rayburn Reservoir in East Texas which covers 113,400 acres.  Alaska is the only state in the United States with more inland waters than Texas.

<P>West Texas deserts include unique species of flora and fauna. Minerals
for mining and one of the nation's largest oak forests are also found in the 
wilds of West Texas.

<P>Texas petroleum provides one-third of the nation's oil and three-fourths 
of the nation's natural gas.

<P>Angora goats make Texas the nation's largest producer of mohair.

<P>Texas has year-round sunshine with generally mild winters and enough 
variety to create a saying -- "If you don't like the weather in Texas, just 
wait a bit and it will change."

<P>Wildlife, including native and exotic species, waterfowl and game birds,
fresh and salt water fish, can be found all over the state.

The Story Of A Good Turn</H1>

<H3>How Scouting Started in the United States</H3>
<HR>

<P>
One day in 1909 in London, England, An American Visitor, William
D. Boyce, lost his way in a dense fog. He stopped under a street
lamp and tried to figure out where he was. A boy approached him
and asked if he could be of help.
<P>
<CITE>&quot;You certainly can,&quot;</CITE> said Boyce. He told
the boy that he wanted to find a certain business office in the
center of the city.
<P>
<CITE>&quot;I'll take you there,&quot;</CITE> said the boy.
<P>
When they got to the destination, Mr. Boyce reached into his pocket
for a tip. But the boy stopped him.
<P>
<CITE>&quot;No thank you, sir. I am a Scout. I won't take anything
for helping.&quot;</CITE>
<P>
<CITE>&quot;A Scout? And what might that be?&quot;</CITE> asked
Boyce.

<P><IMG alt="Flaglogo" src="./gifs/bpsctbdg.gif" align=bottom>
<I> Baden-Powell's Scout Badge </I>

<P>
The boy told the American about himself and about his brother
scouts. Boyce became very interested. After finishing his errand,
he had the boy take him to the British Scouting office.
<P>
At the office, Boyce met Lord Robert Baden-Powell, the famous
British general who had founded the Scouting movement in Great
Britain. Boyce was so impressed with what he learned that he decided
to bring Scouting home with him.
<P>
<IMG alt="85th anniversary patch" src="./gifs/anniv85.gif">
<P>
On February 8, 1910, Boyce and a group of outstanding leaders
founded the Boy Scouts of America. From that day forth, Scouts
have celebrated February 8 as the birthday of Scouting in the
United States.
<P>
What happened to the boy who helped Mr. Boyce find his way in
the fog? No one knows. He had neither asked for money nor given
his name, but he will never be forgotten. His Good Turn helped
bring the scouting movement to our country.
<P>
In the British Scout Training Center at Gilwell Park, England,
Scouts from the United States erected a statue of an American
Buffalo in honor of this unknown scout. <I> One </I>Good Turn
to <I> one </I>man became a Good Turn to millions of American
Boys. Such is the power of a Good Turn.<HR>

<H4>Hence The Scout Slogan: </H4>

<H3>DO A GOOD TURN DAILY</H3>

<H3>Helpful Cooking Tips for Your Next Campout</H3>
<OL>
<LI>Cooked food can be kept warm by placing them in a corrugated cardboard 
box or paper bag that has been lined with several layers of newspaper or 
wrapping paper.
<LI>Place a tablespoon of cooking oil in a pan of rice or beans to be 
cooked.  The oil will calm the contents to reduce boiling over.
<LI>Keep pancake or waffle syrup warm by placing the pitcher or bottle in
a large container of hot water.  Remove the bottle lid so pressure will
not increase when the bottle is heated.
<LI>Before boiling eggs, punch a small hole in the large end of each 
egg.  This allows expansion and may prevent cracking of the egg.
<LI>Soap the bottom and sides of your pots and pans before putting on the 
fire.  This will reduce the amount of scouring you will need to do when 
cleaning up.  Liquid soap is easier to use than bar soap.
</OL>
<HR>
<H3>Dutch Oven Cooking</H3>
<P>For those of you who like to try something new while camping, check
this out!
<P><B>Brown Bears in the Apple Orchard</B>
<P>Method:  Dutch oven or reflector oven.
<P>Time:  25 - 45 minutes
<P>Yield:  8 - 9 servings

<UL>
<LI>Line cooking pan with aluminum foil
<LI>Grease the pan with oil or butter
<LI>Line the bottom of the pan with 2 or 3 sliced apples
<LI>Mix and pour over fruit one package of Gingerbread Mix
<LI>Cover
<LI>Place in heat
</UL>
<HR>
<H3>Did You Know?</H3>
<P>By spraying your pants cuffs and seat area with a fabric protector
such as Scotchguard, you'll stay drier and cleaner on hiking and fishing
outings.  This spray-type waterproofing should be renewed after every
washing.
<HR>
<H3>Pocket Survival Kit</H3>
<P>This kit is something you all should be putting together if you
haven't already.  Comes in pretty handy in a pinch.  This kit should fit
into a tin which snaps tight and fits into your pocket.  Masking tape
stuck around the edges of the tin seals it and can also be used in many ways,
for example, to patch holes in waterproof sheeting.  Include the essential 
items, plus:
<UL>
<LI>Flexible wire saw
<LI>Flint and striker
<LI>Aspirin and plasters
<LI>Wire for fastening and cutting
<LI>Safety pins
<LI>Cleansing wipes
<LI>Waterproof paper and pencil for messages
<LI>Copy of Morse code, first-aid leaflet and drawing of solar still
<LI>Map
</UL>
<HR>
<H3>One Final Note</H3>
<P>Anyone interested in having something put into the newsletter, feel free
to contact Cheryl F. no later that the last Tuesday of each month.  
Anything Scout related is welcome.

<HR>
<H2><I>August 1996 Newsletter, Volume 29 Number 7</I></H2>
<HR>
<P><B><I>Coordinator's Column
</I></B><BR>Pat Tuohy 
</P>
<P>What are a patron's rights when it comes to confidentiality of library
records?  This issue was brought sharply into focus this spring when the reading
habits of Theodore Kaczynski, the alleged Unabomber, made the national news.  A
reporter asked a person identified as &quot;a Lincoln librarian&quot; what
Kaczynski checked out at the library.  The &quot;librarian&quot; obligingly
disclosed what she knew to the national press.  This breach of confidentiality
and the subsequent uproar in the library community raises the issue of our
responsibilities with regard to the right of privacy of our patrons. 
Re-examining our responsibilities before a difficult situation arises is a more
productive and less stressful way to remind ourselves of the duty we have to the
patron. 
</P>
<P>I recently came across an outstanding article on confidentiality in Currents
 the newsletter of the South Texas Library System in Corpus Christi.  The piece
was so good that we have reprinted it in its entirety.  My thanks to STLS for
allowing us to pass on this very interesting article.   
</P>
<P><B>GOODBYE TO SUZAN 
</B><BR>Suzan Nyfeler, children's librarian and consultant extraordinaire, has
resigned from CTLS effective July 30.  Suzan has chosen to direct all of her
joyous energies into the care and nurturing of her three year old son, Jake. 
His indisputable gain is our collective loss.  Suzan began her association with
CTLS in April 1989, a scant seven years ago.  During her tenure at CTLS, Suzan
has helped scores of library staff acquire new skills and insights into library
services for children and youth.  Her creativity, congeniality, and drive have
inspired libraries to make                  children's services a vital part of
their basic services.  
</P>
<P>Good luck, Suzan.  When you decide to come back to the world of libraries,
we hope to be here to welcome your return.  
</P>
<P><B>THE UNABOMBER CASE 
</B><BR><I>Events in Montana
</I><BR>A media interview about the library reading habits of Theodore
Kaczynski, the alleged Unabomber, generated a storm of criticism from the
library community over ethical and legal violations.  Beverly Coleman, who was
originally identified as Kaczynski's hometown librarian, said that staff saved
newspapers and magazines such as Scientific American and Onmi for him and often
tried to borrow out-of-print books through interlibrary loan.  Coleman was
quoted as saying, &quot;Everything was special ordered for him because he liked
such off-the-wall stuff.&quot;
</P>
<P>Librarians from around the country, outraged by this breach of
confidentiality, contacted the director of the Lewis &amp; Clark Library System
for an explanation.  Director Debbie Schlesinger assured critics that no staff
member employed by the Lewis &amp; Clark Library System had made any comment
about the reading habits of any patron.  Any statements attributed to the so-
called &quot;Lincoln librarian&quot; were by a onetime volunteer who was, in
fact, breaking the law.  Montana's law on confidentiality of library records
makes disclosure of patron information a misdemeanor.  Schlesinger said that she
had requested that the county attorney contact Coleman and advise her to cease
and desist or face prosecution. 
</P>
<P><I>Implications for Texas Libraries
</I><BR>Texas law also protects the privacy of library users.  As of September
1, 1993, the Texas Open Records Act protects the confidentiality of records that
identify or serve to identify a person who requested, obtained, or used a
library material or service.  This applies to the records of any library system
which is supported in whole or in part by public funds.  This means that records
of the materials borrowed, information sought, or library services used by any
patron cannot be disclosed to anyone except:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<OL>
<LI>When reasonably necessary for the operation of the library.    </LI>
<LI>By persons authorized, in writing, by the individual named in the records.</LI>
<LI>By order or subpoena of a district court, issued on a showing of good
cause.
</LI></OL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Examples of confidentiality violation are:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>Lists sent to homeroom teachers naming the titles of students' overdue
books.</LI>
<LI>First and last names of children at story times on posters, name tags, etc.
</LI>
<LI>Requests by family members for the names of books checked out by other
family members.</LI>
<LI>Requests by teachers for lists of the names of students who have checked
out materials on reserves.</LI>
<LI>Requests by administrators for the reading records of students or other
library users.</LI>
<LI>In non-computerized library systems, book cards which show the name of the
last user of the book.</LI>
<LI>Public sign-up sheets for use of online or CD-ROM resources.</LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>                            Library directors are urged to adopt a
confidentiality policy, if they have not already done so, and to review it
regularly with staff and volunteers.  A model policy is included in the new
fifth edition of the <I>Intellectual Freedom Handbook</I> available from Texas
Library Association for $7.50, including shipping and handling.  Call (800)
580-2852 for more information.  (Editor's Note:  The CTLS Office has several
copies of the 4th edition available.  See the Checklist.)
<BR>-From &quot;STLS Currents,&quot; May/June 1996  
</P>
<P><B>FIRST LADY'S FAMILY LITERACY INITIATIVE FIRST YEAR GRANT AWARDS</B> 
<BR>On July 9, Governor George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush announced the
winners of $15,000 awards through the First Lady's Family Literacy Initiative
for Texas.  Ed Seidenberg, Director of the Library Development Division of the
Texas State Library, was present at the award ceremony. 
</P>
<P>The First Lady's Family Literacy Initiative is a three year grant program
with the purpose of developing family literacy projects throughout Texas.  The
following communities had winning projects: Bastrop, Beaumont, Bryan, Decatur,
Divine, Houston, Marble Falls, Midland, Mount Pleasant, and Paris. 
</P>
<P>Three public libraries were included in the consortiums that were awarded
grant funds: 
</P>
<P>The Decatur Public Library was included in the program of Decatur
Independent School District whose target is non-English speaking adults and
their Pre K to Grade 3 children. 
</P>
<P>The Marble Falls Library was included in the Burnet County Literacy Council,
whose aim is to enhance the current Family Literacy Project and target
educationally disadvantaged adults and families in the Marble Falls Area. 
</P>
<P>The Paris Public Library was included in the Lamar County Coalition of
Education, Business, and Industries that will develop the Family Literacy
Outreach Project, designed to increase family literacy activities and reading
skills.

</P>
<P><B>QUESTION OF THE MONTH 
<BR></B>Does your town have a policy about the naming of buildings, streets,
parks, and other public facilities?  Austin does, and if you'd like to see a
copy of the city ordinance, I can send it to you.  Some of you have libraries
named after a local person, maybe the donor of an estate which helped build the
library.  In at least one community I know, some folks refused to donate to the
library because it was named after So-and-so.  What a thorny issue! 
</P>
<P>One way around this is to have the library named after your town and put a
large plaque in the entrance area thanking major donors.  Plaques could be on
everything from bookshelves to equipment.  Other libraries use a large &quot;memorial
book&quot; to write the names of donors and the gift (if a book or piece of
equipment).  <B>NEVER</B> put the dollar amount.  
</P>
<P><B>INTERNET SECRETS REVEALED 
</B><BR>Let's start with basics.  The mouse (<B>not</B> a foot pedal) goes
with the ball down on a mouse pad (small piece of cloth-covered rubber).  It may
take some effort to get the motion down.  The big question is, &quot;One click
or two?&quot;  If one click doesn't cause the little hourglass to appear,
double-click it (two clicks in rapid succession).  The second big question is, &quot;Is
it the right mouse button or the left one?&quot;  I click the right mouse button
at work and the left one at home (or is it the other way around?  I never can
remember!).  Stay tuned for more answers to this one. 
</P>
<P>The whole point of this ramble is that you just have to <B>do it</B>. Sit
down with your computer and work on Internet <B>regularly</B> until you have
mastered it.  Like any other skill, it gets easier with practice.  Patrons will
expect you to be the expert;  show them that you are! 
</P>
<P>One of my goals in Internet training is for librarians to know in what ways
the Internet can help.  Some questions can be answered faster with print
resources.  From what I've seen, its forte is <B>current information</B>&#151;the
latest names and addresses for senators and members of congress, for example. 
You can find recipes, too, but cookbooks have better pictures.  Use it and enjoy
it!  
</P>
<P><B>CD-ROM CAUTION 
</B><BR>The May 15 issue of &quot;Library Journal&quot; has an editorial by
Francine Fialkoff, executive editor, quoting Constance Hale, features editor of
&quot;Wired&quot; magazine (online).  Ms. Hale described her difficulty in
getting answers from America Online;  she called it &quot;America Onhold&quot;. 
Further, she states that &quot;many CD-ROMs are riddled with errors,
inaccuracies, and terrible writing.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Just like having to check reviews of books for which ones are the most
reliable, one must read reviews before buying CD-ROMs.  When videos came out, I
only recommended those produced by PBS because they were of such high quality. 
Similarly, CD-ROMs produced by companies whose print versions are excellent and
accurate would be worthwhile choices. 
</P>
<P>This is a combined Internet and CD-ROM hint:  check the accuracy of either
by looking up a subject you know well.  Davy Crockett is my current test
subject.  You can verify the information of many topics;  if there is a product
out there that you've tried and found lacking, please let me know.  The library
world doesn't need misinformation in supposedly sophisticated electronic form!

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Enclosed with this memo is a copy of a postcard (see below) mailed on May
11, 1996, and recently received by one of our member libraries.  Other South
Texas Library System libraries may also have received this postcard.  </P>
<P>Please be advised that at least two STLS member libraries have had a
negative experience with Logos Associates of Attleboro MA, the company named on
the postcard.  Specifically, two libraries ordered a previous edition of the

and <B>prepaid</B>, as required by the company.  They never received the books
and have never received a refund.  </P>
<P>STLS has learned that the Better Business Bureau in Boston has issued a
Reliability Report on Logos Associates.  The report states, in part, &quot;Complaints
allege that the company never shipped the publications that their company had
ordered.  The company responded to these complaints by issuing a refund, and in
some instances, sending a complimentary copy of the publication...Our file
experience shows that this company has an unsatisfactory record with the Bureau.

<P>As I mentioned last month, CTLS now has 35 libraries with some kind of
Internet access.  The next round of grants for Internet access has been
announced .  </P>
<P>However, dial-up Internet access is now widely available and cheap enough
that some libraries will probably not wait for the TSL grants.  What would
dial-up Internet access cost?  </P>
<P>The computer is the most expensive cost, but it needn't be exorbitant.  For
satisfactory access to the World Wide Web you need at least a 486 with a color
VGA monitor and 8 MB of RAM.  If you are on a really tight budget, you can
probably get an adequate computer, modem, and printer for under $1,200.  (And
don't rule out a donation from someone who is upgrading; you may be able to add
what you need for a few hundred dollars.)  </P>
<P>The on-going costs for a dial-up connection are the cost of the phone line,
the connection to the Internet, and printing.  (There are, of course, staff
costs for staff training, for troubleshooting, and, if it's a public access
station, for assisting patrons.)  The phone line can be shared with, say, a fax
machine, but if usage climbs you may need a line just for Internet access.   The
connection to the Internet has two possible costs: the Internet service provider
(ISP) who actually connects your call to the Internet (usually about $20 to
$40/month for unlimited use), and if, you have no ISP within your local calling
area, a long-distance charge for the time you are connected.  Note, however,
that all of the CTLS libraries that wanted a donated dial-up connection have
gotten it and that several other CTLS libraries are using an ISP that offers
toll- free access with its basic service at $20 per month.  </P>
<P>You could use an existing dot matrix printer, but it won't be satisfactory
for printing graphics and would probably be too loud in a public area.  Inkjets
start around $200, but expect to pay about 10 cents per page for black only and
considerably more for color.  </P>
<P>So, for an initial outlay of no more than $1,200 and a monthly cost of $50
($30 for a phone line and $20 for an Internet service provider) you can have
Internet access.  </P>
<P>But why, some may be thinking, should I spend the money&#151;and the time&#151;now?
 The answer is that for better or worse, the Internet will have a major impact
on the way we run our libraries.  By jumping in now, you are getting a head
start on managing change in your library.  You are also getting a head start on
most of the other public agencies&#151;how many small-town police departments,
for example, have Internet access?  Don't discount the PR value of getting there
first!  </P>
<P>Remember when small libraries began using microcomputers in the mid-1980s? 
It took several years for most of us to learn what we needed to know to automate
our libraries in the 1990s.  A year ago I argued that it was still too soon for
most CTLS libraries to jump on the Internet bandwagon.  Access was too costly
and acquiring the skills required to use the Internet productively was too
time-consuming.  Now, however, the time has come for all librarians, no matter
how small or remote the library, to start learning what will be needed to keep
that library vital well into the next century.  </P>
<P>Think of the dial-up Internet connection as training wheels for a transition
to a high-speed direct connection.  Dial-up connections are relatively slow and
work best as a stand-alone station.  To connect every computer in your library
to the Internet will require a direct connection.  But for now, a dial-up
connection is sufficient to develop the skills you and your staff will need to
make the transition to a new way of meeting patrons' needs.  </P>
<P>Within a few years I expect that even small, rural libraries will have
high-speed direct connections, probably through their local school district. 
(The HB 2128 Technology Infrastructure Fund grants will favor applications that
promise cooperation between schools, libraries, and hospitals, especially if
they are in poor, rural areas.)  High- speed direct connections will make
Internet access to resources outside your library as ordinary a part of your
collection as your current magazine subscriptions or encyclopedias.  </P>
<P>The Internet will not replace your collection (which is the fantasy of
cybernerds and librarians who forget that libraries do much more than serve up
information), but paying for high-speed access will definitely stress your
budget.  The costs are difficult to predict at this juncture, but they will
probably depend in large part upon the nature of the partnerships you forge with
other agencies.  Costs may well be higher than for the dial-up connection,
requiring careful attention to balancing spending priorities in your library. 
(Solution: use the public's fascination with new technology to increase your
funding for both books and the Internet!)  </P>
<P>As you know, I have been urging CTLS librarians to get together with
whomever in their local schools is working on a Technology Infrastructure Fund
grant.  Applications for the first $25 million are due September 27, 1996.  The
focus of the first year's grants will be on poor and isolated rural school
districts&#151;just the places where libraries cannot easily get online.  Don't
miss out!   </P>
<P><B>MARC AND MICROLIF    </B><BR>Some librarians have asked about whether
to output records from their automated system for CaTaLySt in MARC or MicroLIF
format.  Practically speaking, it depends more on the age of the system you are
using and how closely the system vendor implemented the &quot;MicroLIF&quot;
format than on differences between the two formats.   </P>
<P>Even before the agreement among the vendors to implement their &quot;1991
USMARC (MicroLIF Protocol)&quot; format, there weren't any format differences
between MicroLIF and USMARC that were significant for most users, apart from the
nuisance of having to keep track of two formats--one designed primarily for
distribution on floppy disks to microcomputer users, the other designed
primarily for distribution on tape to mainframe users.   </P>
<P>The real difference was that librarians and vendors didn't always put the
right information in the right place in the record, or they left it out through
ignorance or sloppiness.  Or, they put the wrong information in the right field.
In short, it was a quality problem, not a format problem.   </P>
<P>So, if you're exporting using 1991 USMARC (MicroLIF Protocol)--ask your
vendor if the screen or manual only says &quot;MicroLIF&quot; and your system is
post-1991--there are no differences between the formats you need worry about. 
(1991 USMARC MicroLIF is now essentially identical to USMARC except for a few
additional fields pertinent to schools, such as reading level, that I don't
believe have yet been adopted for USMARC.  It is also now an official ISO
format, managed by the MARBI committee that controls USMARC, rather than a
vendor format.)  </P>
<P>You notice that there are several similar names for the formats, increasing
the chance of confusion, so the MicroLIF vendors decided to standardize by July
1, 1996 on these names: </P>
<UL>
<LI>USMARC/852 Holdings Data (i. e., the old 1991 USMARC (MicroLIF Protocol))
</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>USMARC/Other Holdings</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>1987 MicroLIF (i. e., the old MicroLIF)  </LI></UL>
<P>Sadly, <I>cataloging</I> with USMARC remains rather confusing, so even if
the name confusion is cleared up, you may still need to worry about quality,
both for records you create and those you got from vendors.  But hallelujah!  We
no longer need worry about format issues!    </P>

<P><B>SHOULD YOUR LIBRARY MAKE MONEY OFF THE INTERNET?  </B><BR>Reading
library newsletters from all over the country, from libraries large and small,
well supported or not, certainly emphasizes the fact that almost everyone is
going headlong into providing Internet access to the public within the walls of
the library.  Not only is this seen as but another way of fulfilling our role as
information providers, but it also provides opportunity to those who either
can't afford computers at home or are just trying to familiarize themselves with
this new communication tool, I foresee only a couple of years before you will be
able to expect just about any library to have at least one terminal with access
to the Internet, and in some cases scores or hundreds.  </P>
<P>But a survey by the Urban Libraries Council a year or so ago revealed
virtually no libraries provide Internet access to their patrons remotely, at
home or in the office, even though many of them offer remote access to various
other databases.  </P>
<P>One of the few seems to be the Cedar Rapids (IA) Public Library, whose May
newsletter to their patrons announced a new payment plan for the subscribers to
their Personal Internet Connection.  They apparently charge $25 a month, or $300
a year, for an &quot;enhanced account&quot; with unlimited hours on the
Internet.  </P>
<P>The Baltimore County Public Library, which I am most familiar with, charges
$75 a year to its patrons for full graphic access and unlimited hours, which I
assume is the kind of service Cedar Rapids provides. 
</P>
<P>Apparently many public libraries, even if going headlong into provision of
Internet access in their library buildings, have real problems with assuming the
role of Internet access providers remotely.  Some of these problems obviously
have to do with the difficulty of the technology itself (you get into all sorts
of problems and choices with modems, routers, telephone lines, servers, etc.,
etc.), but also the front-end cost.  Some have to do with &quot;competition&quot;
with private providers.  Some have to do with equity of service.  But it
certainly is popular in Baltimore County, where over 3,000 people have signed up
in a year, bringing an income of $200,000 a year or so, a large part of which
has to be spent on new equipment or telephone lines to maintain the service.  I
wonder how it's doing in Cedar Rapids? Looks as if it's a success there too, if
the rates they are charging are holding up well.  </P>
<P>It's understandable that few public libraries are going in this direction&#151;yet&#151;because
there's enough trouble and expense in a library of any size just getting access
to the Net in the library itself.  And when all that is done in the next several
years, the telephone and cable companies won't be sitting on their hands when it
comes to providing Internet access over their lines-it can bring in lots of
money! I wonder where the place of public libraries is going to be? Well, as
Ward Shaw, CEO of the CARL Corporation, a system supplier to libraries, once
said, &quot;All I want is a little slice of the Information Highway.&quot; Maybe
the sidewalk, Ward? <BR>-From <I>Library Administrator's Digest</I>, June 1996

</B></I><BR>Tim Prather  </P>
<P><B>&quot;NEED BY&quot; DATES  </B><BR>To us, a need by date is a
cancellation date: in other words, if we can't get the book or article to you by
the need by date, we will cancel your request.  In general, the shorter the need
by date, the greater the likelihood that your request will be canceled.  So, to
avoid unnecessary cancellations, please give realistic need by dates.  </P>
<P>Don't try to use need by dates as a way of getting books faster.  The major
factor influencing how fast you get a book is the availability of the book, not
the speed at which staff work.  You'll get it soonest if it's on the shelf at
Austin's Central Library.  If it's on the shelf at one of Austin's branches or
checked out to a patron, it will be sent to you as soon as the reserve system
can retrieve it.  If it has to be referred on OCLC, it will be referred within
24-48 hours, but we have no control over the speed with which it will be sent by
the lending library.  If your patron truly has a deadline, by all means tell us
what it is&#151;but don't fill in need by dates because you think that will get
the books to you faster.  We don't give preferential treatment to books with
need by dates&#151;what we do is cancel the request if we can't meet the date.  
</P>
<P><B>A NOTE ON RUSH REQUESTS</B>  <BR>We will honor an occasional rush
request but in general you should not be offer ILL as an option when a patron
needs a book or periodical article in less than a week or two.  If a request is
a rush, we literally stop what we are doing and search Central's shelves (or
copy the article or research the subject) and put it in the mail or fax it to
you that day.  Since we give priority to rush requests, they do affect our
ability to handle other requests&#151;so place rushes very, very infrequently. 
</P>
<P>If you have questions about need by dates or rush requests (or any other
ILL-related topic), don't hesitate to call me.   </P>
<P><B>VERIFICATION--WHAT IT IS AND WHY WE WANT YOU TO DO IT  </B><BR>If you
know what verification is and you're already doing it, feel free to skip this
part of my column.  If you don't and aren't, please read on&#151;it's important
that you start verifying the requests you call in or send to ILL. 
</P>
<P>Verification is finding proof in an authoritative source that a particular
book exists.  You should attempt to verify every ILL request before you submit
it.  This means checking each request in CaTaLySt.  If you find the title
listed, make sure the author and title are correct and, if Austin Public Library
owns the title, write down the call number.  You've verified the request.  </P>
<P>What if it's not in CaTaLySt?  Then you need to go a step further.  Look it
up in your copy of <I>Books in Print</I>.  If you find it, check the spelling
of the author and make sure the title is correct.  Then, write down the ISBN
(that's a 10-digit number that identifies that particular book).  What if your
library doesn't have a copy of <I>Books in Print</I>?  Then contact the CTLS
Office&#151;copies are withdrawn from the Austin Public Library collection each
year and it may be possible to get a free copy of last year's edition for your
library.  </P>
<P>Why do this?  Because having the correct information and an ISBN to search
with speeds up our processing of your request.  Also, you get back fewer
cancellations (if an author or title is given to us incorrectly, we'll probably
cancel the request because we won't be able to locate anything that matches). 
Lastly, if a patron has given you a wrong author or title, it'll save you time
in the long run to find that out before you place the request, not after you
receive a cancellation notice.  So please, make an effort to verify all requests
before you call them in.   </P>
<P><B>POLICY REMINDER REGARDING MULTIPLE COPIES </B> <BR>We regard requests
for second copies of titles to be duplicate requests and will cancel them.  If
you have more than one patron who wants to read a book, wait until patron number
one returns it.  If there's enough time left before the due date, check it out
to patron number two.  Otherwise, wait until patron number one's copy is
returned before requesting a copy for patron number two.  I know, this is
inconvenient but consider this:  a) you may already have Austin's only copy and
b) if it's a popular title at your library it's likely to be popular in Austin
too, so additional copies may not be available.  What if you need multiple
copies for a class project?  You (or the teacher who assigned the project) will
have to find other options.  We'll be glad to supply a copy of a title or to
send you books on a particular subject, but we can't be the primary source for
class projects.   </P>
<P><B>ANYBODY GOT AN OLD MICROFICHE CATALOG THEY WANT TO GET RIDE OF?  </B><BR>One
of the area libraries that we serve is the Federal Correctional Institution in
Bastrop.  Because of budget constraints, their library cannot afford to buy a
copy of CaTaLySt.  As a substitute, their librarian has asked for a old copy of
the APL catalog on microfiche.  If any CTLS library has an old copy of the fiche
that they no longer need, please contact me at the Austin ILL office.   </P>
<P><B><I>Media Notes
</I></B><BR>Sharon Herfurth  </P>
<P><B>HOW TO STORE VIDEOS  </B><BR>To help your library's videos last longer,
do not store them flat (horizontally).  Vertical or edge storage is preferable.
</P>
<P>Videotape, being nothing more magical than a magnetically coated ribbon of
plastic, will slip down on the reels if the tape is stored flat.  This can
result in crinkling or other damage to the audio or video track of the program,
which is stored on the edge of the tape.  It can also cause the tape to play
improperly (or not play at all) on your patron's VCR resulting in more
complaints about the video, and more staff time being wasted checking videos. 
If you already have tapes that have been stored improperly, wind and rewind
them, then store on edge.  </P>
<P>Also, videocassettes and fiber-fill (shredded newspapers and other recycled
stuff) do not mix.  Airborne fibers get inside the cassette case, onto the tape,

<P><B>AUTHOR FEATURES LIBRARIAN SLEUTH 
</B><BR>Austin resident Jeff Abbott writes a Texas-based mystery series
featuring small-town librarian and amateur sleuth Jordan Poteet.  When asked why
he chose a librarian for his main character, here's what Abbot said: &quot;I
didn't plan on centering a series around a librarian.  When I was trying to
decide who to kill off if I wrote a small town mystery, a bookburner seemed an
appealing victim (appealing to get rid of, that is).  And I was curious to
explore the personality of such a victim.  The obvious foe for a bookburner is a
librarian, and so Jordan Poteet was born.  </P>
<P>&quot;I've gotten some criticism for not having Jordan be a credentialed
librarian, but I wanted to be realistic, and in many small towns the librarian
doesn't have an MLS.  It's very hard to keep folks with master's degrees working
in small libraries, and the librarian who helped me understand what running a
small town library is like isn't credentialed&#151;she worked her way up. 
Jordan is my salute to her and her colleagues.  </P>
<P>&quot;I think librarians make for great detectives.  They are innately
concerned with the preservation of knowledge, they're inquisitive, they come in
contact with lots of interesting people, and they have lots of facts at hand to
bolster their sleuthing.  </P>
<P>&quot;I did break the small town librarian stereotype with Jordan by making
him a big, blonde guy who's not a bookworm and not shy.  He's very much a good
ole boy with a Southern gentleman's heart.&quot;  The books in the Jordan Poteet
series are: <I>Do Unto Others</I> (1994), <I>The Only Good Yankee</I> (1995),
and
<I>Promises of Home</I> (1996). <BR>-From &quot;Smiletter,&quot; May/June

<P><STRONG>GOOD BYE TO A DEAR FRIEND OF TEXAS LIBRARIES</STRONG><BR> The
Texas library world was sadden to hear of the death of Elizabeth Crabb on August
25, 1996. Elizabeth was an advocate for libraries and for intellectual freedom
for more than 50 years.  Her legacy will span beyond her years.  Her passionate
support for freedom of information and her adamant stance on public service were
the characteristics that defined her life as a person, a professional, and as an
activist. Elizabeth was instrumental in the passage of the Texas Library Systems
Act in 1969 which created library systems in Texas.  She served 20 years as
coordinator of the Northeast Texas Library System.  Her tireless efforts on
behalf of libraries were legendary in both houses of the Texas Legislature.    
</P>
<P>Texas libraries honored Elizabeth for her work many times.  In 1980 she was
named Librarian of the Year by the Texas Library Association.  TLA honored her
again in 1989 with the Distinguished Service award. 
</P>
<P>We will miss her greatly.  Memorial gifts can be sent to the Elizabeth Crabb
Memorial Fund at
<A HREF="http://www.txla.org">TLA</A>, 3355 Bee Cave Rd, Suite 401, Austin TX,

Registration begins at 8:00 am.  The registration is $15.00 and includes a

</P>
<P>The CTLS Membership Meeting begins immediately after the TLA business

District III meeting is encouraged but not required.  Member librarians who
attend both the morning and afternoon sessions will have completed two of the
three events necessary for fulfillment of the SFY 1998 Collection Development
grant requirement.  Attendance at the afternoon session will satisfy the
business meeting requirement for the year.    
</P>
<P><STRONG>PROPOSED BY-LAWS CHANGES TO BE CONSIDERED <BR> AT MEMBERSHIP
MEETING</STRONG><BR> The CTLS Long Range Planning Committee has proposed the
first changes to the CTLS By-Laws since 1987.  Under the proposed changes, the
number of mandatory general System meetings would be changed from two to one. 
The current By-Laws require general membership meetings in the fall and spring
of year fiscal year.  Regional meetings in the Fall provide another opportunity
for CTLS members to discuss System business with colleagues.  
</P>
<P>The proposed change would allow but not mandate a second general meeting
during the year.  This change would also alter the timing of elections to fill
Advisory council vacancies.  The current schedule has election of Advisory
Council members at the Spring meeting of each fiscal year with new officers
assuming their duties the following September.  Under the proposed changes, the
election of Advisory Council members would take place at the fall membership
meeting with those elected taking office immediately.  
</P>
<P>These changes to the current By-Laws will be presented to the membership at
the September 28th membership meeting.  Voting will be by weighted ballot.  Only
Lay Representatives (or designated proxy) will be able to vote on this matter. 
Be sure that your library has a Lay Representative at the September meeting. 
</P>
<P>Copies of these proposed changes and of the current By-Laws were mailed
August 27 to all Lay Representatives and member libraries.  If you did not
receive a copy, call the CTLS office.  
</P>
<P>If you have questions about these changes, please contact: Adele Wilkins,
CTLS Advisory Council Chair at (512) 756-4711 or Pat Tuohy at (800) 262-4431 or

<P><STRONG>LIBRARY EMPLOYEE FOILS THEFT  </STRONG><BR> A University of
Arkansas professor of English was arrested and charged with attempted theft from
the Marfa Public Library, according to Marfa Police Chief Rusty Taylor.  
</P>
<P>Dwain Edgar Manske, 62, of Fayetteville, Arkansas, on March 20 attempted to
steal several documents from the Marfa Junior Historian files at the library,
including photographs, stock certificates, military commissions, and letters all
dated from the 1800s.  
</P>
<P>Taylor said one document was labeled &quot;Marfa, Texas, 1813.&quot;  
</P>
<P>Manske was held at the Presidio County Jail.  
</P>
<P>Taylor said Manske was charged with a Class A misdemeanor in the amount of
$500 to $1,500, depending on the value assessed by the library.  
</P>
<P>&quot;He signed a written statement admitting the theft,&quot; Taylor said. 
&quot;He told me that he is a collector and wanted to add these things to his
collection.&quot;  
</P>
<P>Librarian Ester Sanchez said Manske first came into the library Tuesday and
said he was compiling a book about available historical documents in libraries
throughout the state.  
</P>
<P>&quot;When he came in, I asked him to work at the front table, but he said
he would rather sit in the back, so I decided to watch him.  I saw him put
several items in his notebook.  I called library board member Mary Davis and
then went outside to copy his car license plate number.  I then called the
police.  
</P>
<P>&quot;As the man was leaving, I asked him to come back so I could talk to
him.  I asked him to put his notebook on the table and to remove everything from
his pockets.  He also had documents stuck in his pants which were hidden by his
coat.&quot;  
</P>
<P>Sanchez said he admitted to stealing the documents explaining that he &quot;was
greedy.&quot;  
</P>
<P>Manske's vehicle was impounded in order to inventory other items found in
the vehicle, Taylor said.  
</P>
<P>Kudos to Ester Sanchez, Marfa Public Library Director.  Thanks to Ester's
quick action, the library did not lose valuable materials.  Keep up the good
work.<BR> -From Texas Trans-Pecos Library System Newsletter, July 1996.

<P><STRONG>CONTINUING EDUCATION NOTES</STRONG> <BR> The Texas State Library
presented a workshop in Rosebud entitled &quot;Finding Funds for Library
Services.&quot;  Presenter Patty Davis made some interesting points, among them:
 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Look locally first.  Many foundations will only fund projects in their own
community or in the vicinity.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Get the Texas Register.  Call Patty about this at (512) 463-5476.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Check with your school district to see if they get the publication, &quot;Education
Grants Alert.&quot;  Perhaps your library would be eligible for some of the
grants mentioned in it.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Have a wish list in your library.  Post it, print it in the newspaper, and
have it on flyers to hand out.</LI></UL>
<P>This was a helpful workshop.  Please call me if you would like to know more.
  
</P>
<P><STRONG>BOOKS, BOOKS, BOOKS</STRONG> <BR>
<EM>The Handbook of Texas</EM> is now out in its new edition (all six volumes).
 What to do with the old edition?  I may be wrong on this, but since it is Texas
history, I would suggest you keep it if it is not falling apart and you have
room for it.  Make a note on the flyleaf:  &quot;Newer edition available&quot;
or keep it behind the desk.  Without comparing the two side by side, I couldn't
say if all the articles were revised.  It seems that it would be worthwhile to
keep it for the historical perspective of almost 50 years ago.  Keep it in
reference;  these older volumes are out of print.  I also have some withdrawn
Austin copies of this;  call if you are interested.  
</P>
<P><EM>Directory of Texas Manufacturers</EM> is an important Texas book that
you should have.  Many libraries ask me for older, withdrawn copies, and I never
have enough for everyone.  Please consider purchasing this if you are tired of
waiting and can find a spare $130 in your budget.  Call the University of Texas'
Bureau of Business Research at (512) 471-5179.   
</P>
<P><STRONG>INTERNETTING AROUND  </STRONG><BR> Those of you who are working
with Internet have learned some new tricks.  Not only have you learned how to
use search engines, but you have also figured out how to pick the most important
parts of a reference question to use as your search terms.  Not being an
experienced database searcher myself, I have found this to be one of the most
challenging parts of Internet searching.  Another has been the waiting.  One
person at our training said that she always keeps a library magazine handy so
that she can read while waiting for the Internet to do its work!  
</P>
<P>If you are on PUBLIB or another listserv, I hope it has been helpful.  The
questions posted are ones you may have had; the answers from across the country
will either confirm your hunches, or help you see something in a different
light.  Our own CTLS-L has had some good questions and answers.  I usually reply
to the individual and not to the list;  that way, I can personalize my answer
and be wordy, or talk about a related topic and not feel like I'm taking someone
else's time up unnecessarily.  
</P>
<P>Those of you with email have, I hope, enjoyed the convenience of it.  We are
enjoying it here in the CTLS office.  If anyone needs the information on how to
copy just one page from a digest, please let me know.  I had to try each of
several methods I saw on PUBLIB before I found one that worked for me!   
</P>

<P><STRONG>QUICK AND EASY WAY TO FIND BOOKS ON ANY SUBJECT  </STRONG><BR>
BOOKSCOPE is a CD-ROM resource that makes it fast and easy for librarians and
users to locate the most current and descriptive book information.  It's the
only book reference database with both tables of contents and reviews.  The
database contains more than 350,000 titles, along with over 5,000 author
biographies, and over 25,000 book summaries.  Each year 50,000 new titles are
added.  Keyword searching and an &quot;intuitive interface&quot; allow patrons
to use BOOKSCOPE without assistance.  Convenient subject browsing helps
librarians build their collections in subject areas, narrow or broad.  Detailed
information, such as type of book and readership level, helps librarians
pinpoint the most appropriate books for their libraries.  For a free four-month
preview, including monthly updates, call (800) 444-0799, fax (203) 397-3893, or

<P>As of this month, 41 CTLS members will have Internet access. Twenty-four
CTLS members, mostly small libraries, have gotten access through the State
Library's SFY 1996 grant to MAIN (Metropolitan Austin Interactive Network). 
Although the original grant was for only 20 libraries, the State Library
recently provided some unused grant training funds which allowed us to add four
more libraries.  
</P>
<P>The additional funds for the current year's grant were especially welcome,
because MAIN did not receive a grant for SFY 1997.  Our application for 16 more
CTLS libraries had the fourth highest score for group applications, but there
was only enough money for the first three applicants&#151;which, unfortunately
for us, were very large projects in Houston and NTRLS.  However, four of the 16
libraries which had applied for SFY 1997&#151;Fairfield, Groesbeck, Salado, and
West&#151;have been connected with the additional SFY 1996 money.  
</P>
<P>The equipment for all 24 grant recipients has been installed, and Laurie
Mahaffey and I have provided beginner's and intermediate training (three hours
each) for most of them.  After we finish with the grant libraries, we will make
the training available to any other member that desires it.  (Several members&#151;Elgin,
Lampasas, and San Saba&#151;which were not grant recipients but recently got
Internet access, have asked for the training.  See the request page for a copy
of the outline of what is included in the training.)  Also, any CTLS member can
take advantage of the online lessons provided by the State Library for the grant
recipients.  
</P>
<P>In addition to the 41 libraries with Internet access, we have six libraries
in Burnet and Llano counties which have email access (i.  e., they cannot &quot;surf&quot;
the Net, but they can send and receive email).  All of these libraries&#151;except
Austin&#151;are subscribed to CTLS-L, a mailing list that allows us to exchange
information quickly via email.  Currently, there are about 60 subscribers to
CTLS-L.  
</P>
<P>I estimate that by January 1997 there will be 10 more members with Internet
access.  Over the next two years, as the Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund
grants make Internet access more widely available in rural areas, I anticipate
that all of our libraries will have access.  Also, as you may have heard, TLA is
asking the Legislature to fund a much higher level of resource sharing among
libraries of all kinds, and the Internet will undoubtedly be one of the
principal means of sharing.  By the SFY 2000-2001 biennium, I expect Internet
access to resources in other libraries and ILL via the Internet will be as
commonplace as fax and phone are now.  
</P>
<P>Speaking of the Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund (TIF), the first
year's grant applications are due September 27.  About $25 million is available,
with rural and poor school districts getting priority.  If you haven't already
contacted the person at your school district who may be planning an application,
I recommend you do so.  Remind them that one of the criteria for evaluating
applications is whether the project involves cooperation with a public library,
college, or university.  
</P>
<P>Carole Leita, of Berkeley (CA) Public Library, gave a terrific Internet
reference workshop at the CTLS/APL August 2 Staff Development day.  One of her
handouts was a chart of eleven popular search engines and directories, showing
what's in each database and tips on how to search it.  Even an experienced
searcher would probably want to keep it by the computer.  She posted the chart
at <A HREF="http://infopeople.berkeley.edu.8000/src/chart.htm">http://infopeople.berkeley.edu:8000
/src/chart.html</A>, and she will update it as required&#151;or, see the request
page for a printed copy.  Carole also brought along two books for beginners as
well as experienced searchers which looked quite helpful:

<P><STRONG>AUSTIN ILC IS CONNECTED!  </STRONG><BR> Earlier this month the
Austin Interlibrary Loan Center completed its setup of the hardware and software
required for accessing the Internet.  We are now connected!  We have already
begun to use the resources of the Internet to fill area library requests,
especially subject  and reference requests.  We were able to try it out almost
immediately on a special reference request:  one of the area libraries requested
a list of all the episode titles from the TV series <EM>Rawhide</EM>.  We
discovered after a few minutes searching that there is indeed a Rawhide
Homepage, which included an episode listing.  Ultimately, we filled the request
from a book in the Austin Public Library reference collection, because this
episode listing on the Internet was not completed yet.  But still, the ease with
which we were able to locate at least a partial answer at our desktop was
impressive.  
</P>
<P>We hope to soon be able to receive and respond to interlibrary loan requests
over the Internet.  We have two email addresses:  To contact Tim Prather, email:

</P>
<P>If you would like to use email to query us on requests or even to experiment
with sending us requests, please do so.  But keep in mind that this is a new
medium for us and it may take us some time to work out an efficient way to
process email.  Please use the &quot;iloan&quot; address above for sending your
requests or reference questions.  Use the &quot;tprather&quot; address for
contacting me if you have concerns or suggestions about our service.

<P><STRONG>ILL CONTACT FORMS</STRONG> <BR> In September we will be sending
out forms to obtain the current address and phone number for ILL contact people
in our region.  Please be sure to complete and return the form to us.  We
especially need the name of the person who is primarily responsible for
submitting ILL requests to the Austin ILL Center.  Please include also that
person's phone number and mailing address, if the mailing address differs from
the library's address.

Awards are monetary awards given each spring to library applicants selected by
the Award Committee.   
</P>
<P><STRONG>Application Eligibility</STRONG> Application is open to public
libraries in Texas which   serve a population of 20,000 or less,   are legally
established, and   are open for service at least 20 hours a week.    
</P>
<P><STRONG>Number and Amount of Awards</STRONG> The number and amount of
awards depend on net income produced by the Trust.  In 1996, each of four
libraries received an award of $6,841.    
</P>
<P><STRONG>Expenditures of Awards</STRONG> According to the terms of the
Trust, funds awarded may be used solely for the purchase of books.  Note: books
which have been reformatted for ease of use, i.e. books on audio tape or CD-ROM,
are eligible.    
</P>
<P><STRONG>Award Criteria</STRONG> In establishing the Trust, Mr. Dobie
instructed the Award Committee to take into consideration the degree of support
that applicants receive from their communities.   Therefore, awards are made not
only on the basis of need, but also on the extent to which community
governments, library boards, Friend's organizations, and individuals have
promoted and supported the library, in comparison with their potential to do so.
 Applications should include, but need not be limited to, the following
information to help the Committee determine the support of the library by the
community, the support of the community by the library, and the library's need
of additional book resources.  
</P>
<OL>
<LI>A brief history of the library and description of its service area.</LI>
<LI>The library's itemized budget for the current year and itemized
expenditures for the two preceding years.</LI>
<LI>The amount of library income for the current year and two preceding years
by source.  As applicable, itemized income derived from city government, county
government, school district, state government, federal government, and income
derived from the private sector (gifts, fund raising events, etc.).</LI>
<LI>The number of full-time and part-time salaried staff by job title, and the

and school libraries.</LI>
<LI>An account of local efforts in support of the library, extending over one
or more years.  Statistics provide some evidence of continuing local support of
the library, but limited insight to the persistency and intensity of effort that
went into their making.  Tell how local government, businesses, and citizens
groups have contributed to the betterment of the library.  Tell of efforts the
library staff, board, and friends have made toward the promotion and improvement
of library service.</LI>
<LI>The kinds of books the library proposes to buy and the reasons for such
purchases.  There are no restrictions on the kinds of books that may be bought;
however, regardless of type, books purchased should be of good quality and
lasting value.</LI>

Summer Reader:  
</P>
<OL>
<LI>It's not homework.  Children can read what they want and enjoy it more.</LI>
<LI>It's easy to join the Pike's Peak Library District's Summer Reading Club at
any of the 11 branch libraries or two bookmobiles with 32 stops.</LI>
<LI>It's full of prizes and program fun.</LI>
<LI>It's something you can do together anytime, anywhere.</LI>

</P>
<P>CTLS members gathered September 28 to honor the service of several System
members, adopt Bylaws changes, and to preview System activities for the coming
year.   
</P>
<P>Dr. Robert McConnell was honored by the membership for his six years of
service on the Advisory Council.  Adele Wilkin, Advisory Council Chair,
presented Dr. Bob with a plaque acknowledging his service and dedication to
community libraries in central Texas. 
</P>
<P>The Bylaws changes, the first revision in more than nine years, were
formulated by the Long Range Planning Committee at their August retreat in
Burnet. 
</P>
<P>Under the proposed changes, CTLS would have at least one general membership
meeting per year.  Elections for Advisory Council members would occur at the
Fall membership meeting.  Newly elected Advisory Council members would begin
their terms immediately upon election.  The Advisory Council would elect their
officers in executive session in conjunction with the membership meeting. 
</P>
<P>Nancy Franklin, Mt. Calm Librarian and member of the Long Range Planning
Committee pointed out that the changes allow rather than mandate a second
general membership meeting; a Spring meeting can be called at the discretion of
the Advisory Council.  Fall regional meetings are not affected by this Bylaws
change. Lay Representatives newly elected to the Advisory Council will begin
their terms immediately rather than waiting seven months as in the past.
</P>
<P>Members adopted the proposed changes by weighted vote of 33 to 0. 
</P>
<P>The SFY 1997 Annual Plan of Service was previewed.  The 1997 System budget
of $799,531 is slightly larger than the 1996 budget ($783,717) due in part to an
increase in our population.  Allocations for all SFY 1997 programs are very
close to last year's levels. 
</P>
<P>Dr. Ron Wyllys, Chair of the Long Range Planning Committee, outlined the
agenda for the Fall regional meetings.  The regional meetings will employ a
focus group, and participants will be asked to anticipate the needs of their
libraries and their patrons in the year 2000.  Dates for the regional meetings
are November 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22. Locations can be found on the
<A HREF="http://www.main.org/ctls/calendar.htm">calendar page</A>. 
</P>
<P>Adele Wilkin introduced the new members of the Long Range Planning Committee
who began two year terms in September 1996.  The new members are Maria Weber,
Kyle Community Library; Joanne Thornton, Pflugerville Community Library; and
Peggy Curci, Copperas Cove Public Library.   Wilkin also thanked the former
members of the Long Range Planning Committee for their hard work on behalf of
the System.  Members completing a four year stint are Doris Herrington, Teague
Public Library; Pamela Bonnell, Waco-McLennan County Library; and Pat Beavers,
Woodson Memorial Library in Caldwell.   
</P>
<P><B>STAFF CHANGES AT CTLS</B> 
<BR>Amanda Williams was appointed to the CTLS staff as Youth Services
Consultant on September 23.  She takes the position formerly held by Suzan
Nyfeler.  Amanda has more than 10 years' experience as a children's librarian in
Dallas and in Austin. She is currently completing work on a doctorate in Library
Science at the University of Texas.  Amanda will work part time for the next few
months while she completes research for her dissertation.  Welcome Amanda. 
</P>
<P>CTLS is losing a mainstay of the Media Program.  Media mogul Betty Sachnik
moves on to a fast paced job with a local architectural firm in early October. 
Her helpfulness and efficiency will be missed by the many CTLS members who rely
on her for both media needs and as an Internet correspondent and trainer.  Good
luck Betty, we will miss you.  
</P>
<P><B>NEW MEMBER OF CTLS 
</B><BR>A new library has joined the CTLS family.  Valley Mills Public Library
joins the 60 public libraries in central Texas that comprise the membership of
CTLS.  The Library is located on the eastern edge of Bosque County.  Please
extend a hearty greeting to Librarian Kathleen Hale and the Valley Mills Public
Library.  Welcome to the System!     
</P>
<P><B>GOOD NEWS FOR CAMERON!
</B>
<BR>Congratulations to Mary Amerson, Director of the Cameron Public Library. 
She won $250 worth of new children's books for her library! To encourage reading
club managers to return their evaluation forms and statistics to the Texas State
Library, forms received by September 6 were entered into a drawing. 
</P>
<P>Books will be chosen, with input from Mary, from titles received for review
by the Texas State Library.  Titles to be sent to Cameron Public Library include
<I>The Book of Dragons</I> by Michael Hague, <I>In the Heart of The Village</I>
by Barbara Bash, and <I>The Visual Dictionary of Human Anatomy</I>. 
</P>
<P>Because TSL had such a good response (almost 400) and were having such a
good time, TSL decided to give a second prize of $75 worth of books to Veronica
Myers, Armijo Branch, El Paso Public Library.  Books Veronica's library will
receive include <I>Spring: A Haiku Story</I> by George Shannon, <I>Grandmother
is Pigeon</I> by Louise Erdrich, and <I>The Garden of Happiness</I> by Erika
Tamar. 
</P>
<P>Libraries reported serving 341,147 children in 1996 Texas Reading Clubs in
public libraries.  But almost 100 libraries still have not reported their
statistics! These numbers are important and show the value of this state funded
project.  If you have not submitted your statistics, Jeanette Larson at the
Texas State Library still needs them.  
</P>
<P><B><I>Collection Management Notes
</I></B><BR>Laurie Mahaffey 
</P>
<P><B>DOBIE GRANTS</B><BR>It's that time of year--time to apply for a Dobie
Grant!  J. Frank Dobie was a professor at the University of Texas who had roots
in the ranching culture of South Texas.  He developed a course entitled, &quot;Life
and Literature of the Southwest,&quot; which was very popular with students.  No
one had made much of the literature of this part of the country up until that
time (the 1930s).  All the literature taught was either European or eastern
American. 
</P>
<P>J. Frank and his wife, Bertha, had no children.  Toward the latter part of
his life, he wanted to leave a legacy for the generations to follow.  The trust
they set up benefits public libraries in Texas. 
</P>
<P>The executors of the trust allot the money so that each library receives
enough to make a difference (usually a couple of thousand dollars or more).  The
money does not have to be spent all in one year.  It is best to target a part of
the collection that needs help and spend in that area only.  James Stewart,
director of the Victoria Public Library and chair of the Dobie Grant Committee,
recommended &gt;<BLINK>not</BLINK>&lt; including letters of support in the
grant application.  Pictures &gt;<BLINK>worth</BLINK>&lt; a thousand words
should be included (and those not...get it?!).
</P>
<P>It is possible to win a grant more than once.  The committee weighs the
other applications that year when deciding.  We have copies of successful grant
applications;  please call Terry or me if you would like to see one. 
</P>
<P>This is one of the best grants for libraries.  A library does not have to
have matching funds or keep the books in a special place. For more information,
see the Public Relations Column below.  Call us if you would like to know more. 

</P>
<P><B>NEWS FROM BAKER &amp; TAYLOR 
</B><BR>You should have gotten a pink postcard from Baker &amp; Taylor this
summer with information about their new, faster system.  They promise to ship
books quicker than ever before.  I am interested in hearing from everyone if B&amp;T
are keeping to their plan. 
</P>
<P>Another new wrinkle from B&amp;T is the addition of what they call &quot;value-added&quot;
charges to invoices.  I begged them for this years ago;  I'm sure I'm not the
only one who hated to see separate invoices for $1.50 worth of cataloging and
processing!  Please let me know if this is working out all right, also.  We
recommend that you get this service&#151;the cataloging and processing&#151;from
them.  It will save you headaches and usually time in getting the books on the
shelves.  If you have questions about anything concerning B&amp;T,
Bound-to-Stay-Bound, or purchasing in general, please call Darlene, Monica, or
me.  We are here to help you.  
</P>
<P><B>CONTINUING EDUCATION NEWS</B> 
<BR>Several interesting workshops have been scheduled for the coming fiscal
year.  In addition to the ones the CTLS staff presents, Patty Davis of the Texas
State Library will present &quot;Cultural Diversity&quot; on Thursday, January
23 in Lampasas and Friday, January 24 in Rockdale. 
</P>
<P>Patty will again repeat &quot;Finding Funds for Libraries&quot; on Thursday,
February 6 in San Marcos and Friday, February 7 in Groesbeck. 
</P>
<P>TSL is bringing Rob Reid, author of Children's Jukebox, to Austin on
Tuesday, December 10.  He will present &quot;Do, Re, Mi: Music Programming for
Children in Public Libraries&quot; at the Thompson Conference Center (on the
University of Texas campus, site of Austin Public Library's annual Staff
Development Day).  Friday,  </P>
<P>February 28, Texas State Library will present another children's workshop
with Carol Fiore, in Austin at the Joe C. Thompson Conference Center.  The
working title is &quot;Summer Programming for Children in Public Libraries.&quot;
 This workshop will be in addition to our own Texas Reading Club workshops. 
Stay tuned for more information.

<P><B>AN INTERACTIVE INSTRUCTION PROGRAM FOR SHELVERS
</B>
<BR><I>Take This Book and Shelvelt!</I> is an interactive instructional
program for student shelvers developed at Norwich University's Kreitzberg
Library by Stuart Kohler. 
</P>
<P>The program covers a basic introduction to call numbers (both Dewey Decimal
and Library of Congress) and then presents an interactive exercise sorting &quot;virtual
books&quot; on a &quot;virtual shelf.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The introductory screen offers three options: a student worker can get an
overview of the tutorial, an explanation of why accurate shelving is important,
and explanations of basic concepts. 
</P>
<P>The student is then presented with the virtual bookshelf and may click on a
book and then an arrow to arrange the call numbers in correct order.  After
arranging the books to his or her satisfaction a click on &quot;Check Me!&quot;
will reveal the accuracy of the order. 
</P>
<P>After five correct repetitions the user is congratulated for five
consecutive successes, then reports to the stack supervisor for a brief
introduction to the collection, and turned loose with a book truck. 
</P>
<P>Anecdotal experience confirms that our student shelvers are more reliable
and our spot inventories reveal fewer shelving errors.  Clearly, our stack
supervisor has found relief from the tedious task of training 60 new faces a
year, and she is convinced that our shelvers' knowledge and attention to detail
is greater than before. 
</P>
<P><I>Take This Book and ShelveIt!</I> is shareware available at the Norwich
Library's Web site.  For the Windows or Mac version, point your browser at

 (Editor's Note: We downloaded the program just to check it out, and it is both
fun and educational.  The Friends of the Norwich University's Libraries ask for
a donation of $10 to $25 if you find the program useful.)

<P><B>MICROFILMING SERVICES STILL AVAILABLE IN HUNTSVILLE
</B>
<BR>A reminder that public libraries (as well as state agencies, historical
organizations, etc.) in Texas are eligible to use the microfilming services of
the Huntsville Wynne Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.  This is
a very cost effective way to get newspapers and other important records
preserved on microfilm.
</P>
<P>The usual price is $60 a roll and $6.50 for a duplicate; the cost could be
more if the papers are fragile or torn.  In the past, STLS has been told that
the Unit would try to work with public libraries on a pick-up and delivery
schedule, since they deliver materials around the state. 
</P>
<P>For more information or to discuss having some records microfilmed, contact
Mark Tissue at  (409) 291-5113 or (409) 295-9126; or Earl Curry at (409)
291-5126.  The address is Texas Dept. of Criminal Justice, Records Conversion
Facility, Wynne Unit, Huntsville TX, 77349.

<P><B>LARGE PRINT BUY-BACK PROGRAM
</B>
<BR>Thorndike Press, which publishes Thorndike and G.K. Hall large print books,
is currently featuring a replacement program with a discount on new titles
purchased by libraries.  For every title page of a withdrawn large print book
(from any publisher), a library will receive a 30 percent discount on a new
large print book.  For libraries with a lot of old, worn-out large print books,
this could be a good way to get a discount when buying new ones.  For more
information and a copy of the special order form which must be used, call
Thorndike at (800) 223-2348; this is Promo # 1102.  The offer ends October 31,
1996.

<P><B>MORE BOOKS IN SPANISH AVAILABLE FROM U.S. PUBLISHERS</B> 
<BR>Several large publishers in the U.S. have started publishing books in
Spanish (often Spanish versions of their English-language titles).  For example,
Simon &amp; Schuster now has <I>Aguilar Libros en Espa&ntilde;ol</I> and
HarperCollins publishes <I>HarperLibros</I>.  Random House (<I>Vintage Espa&ntilde;ol</I>)
recently issued a catalog of Latin American, Caribbean, and Spanish literature
in Spanish and English.  And a recent flyer received in the STLS offices from
Mook &amp; Blanchard, distributors of prebound Ortho and Sunset books, lists
several Spanish titles produced by both publishers. 
</P>
<P>For information about these books in Spanish, call:  Simon &amp; Schuster (<I>Aguilar
Libros en Espa&ntilde;ol</I>) (800) 223-2348.  S &amp; S recently published a
Spanish version of Dr. Richard S. Beaser's book on diabetes: <I>Manual Joslin
Para la Diabetes</I> (ISBN 0-684- 82387-X; $14 pb).  Most of their
Spanish-language books are popular nonfiction titles. 
</P>
<P>HarperCollins (<I>HarperLibros</I>) (800) 242-7737.  HarperCollins now has
a large number of children's and adult titles in Spanish; they're featured in a
brochure showing the covers and giving order information. 
</P>
<P>Random House (<I>Vintage Espa&ntilde;ol</I>) (800) 726-0600.  Random House
is publisher of <I>The House on Mango Street</I> and the Spanish version, <I>La
Casa en Mango Street</I> and other works by Sandra Cisneros.  The 25-page
catalog mentioned above lists a large number of books in Spanish, reference
materials, and books about the Spanish language and Latin American literature,
politics, and culture. 
</P>
<P>Mook &amp; Blanchard (800) 875-9911. The recent flyer received lists four
Sunset books in Spanish (<I>Cableado B&aacute;sico</I> [<I>Basic Wiring</I>],
for example) and six Ortho titles in Spanish (such as <I>Dise&ntilde;io de
Jardines</I> [<I>Landscape Design</I>] and Hortalizas [Vegetables]).

</P>
<P><B><I>Automation and Cooperation Notes
</I></B><BR>Bob Gaines 
</P>
<P>You may notice that my column has a new name this month.  Actually, the name
is just now catching up with decisions made years ago.  The Long Range Plan
adopted in 1988 intended the automation program to foster cooperation among
member libraries.  And the 1993 plan designated &quot;Automation and Cooperation&quot;
as one of five goals for the System.  Last year, the Advisory Council officially
added &quot;Cooperation&quot; to the name of the Automation Committee. 
</P>
<P>So, while it doesn't really indicate a change of emphasis on my part, adding
&quot;Cooperation&quot; to my column's name seems warranted, particularly in
view of what I want to highlight this month. 
</P>
<P>The Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund (TIF) Board has extended the
deadline for grant applications from September 27 to November 15.  If your
school district or consortium is preparing an application and your library has
not yet joined in, you may still have time.  (The $25 million worth of
first-year grants will go primarily to schools, but at the September board
meeting the TIF executive director explicitly included public libraries among
the targeted institutions.) 
</P>
<P>As can be expected with a start-up organization (by mid-September TIF had
still not hired all its staff!), TIF has had difficulty explaining exactly what
the first-year projects should attempt to do and exactly what kind of
applications are likely to be successful. 
</P>
<P>But don't let the confusion scare you off!  I urge you to do whatever you
can to have your library included in any planning process in your area.  Even if
you don't get in this year, it's not too early to make your interest known to
your school superintendent or district technology coordinator.  Keep in mind
that next year's grants will probably increase to $75 million or more. 
</P>
<P>Over the next 10 years TIF will surely be the most important initiative
affecting public libraries in Texas (it's going to bring $1.5 billion in
telecommunications infrastructure to schools, libraries, and colleges).  Because
of TIF our future will be much more closely tied to that of schools and
colleges.  However, there are also other forces pushing us toward cooperation,
because government at all levels is being pressured to increase efficiency by
reducing duplication of services. 
</P>
<P>Traditionally, public libraries, schools, and colleges have each gone their
own way.  Currently, the State Library , through the Texas State Electronic
Library (TSEL), provides  public libraries and state agencies free access to
several commercial databases and other resources, plus a public library-only ILL
system.  The Texas Education Agency provides K-12 schools with a World Wide Web
union catalog (called the Texas Library Connection, or TLC) for ILL.   And the
Higher Education Coordinating Board provides access to commercial databases and
document delivery for public universities and colleges through TexShare.  So
far, state law and institutional culture have made cooperation extremely
difficult or impossible. 
</P>
<P>TLA is hoping to take advantage of the new enthusiasm for streamlining
government services to improve access for everyone by coordinating and enhancing
these agencies' efforts.  TLA's vision is to develop an &quot;effective
statewide resource sharing program [which] will involve the physical transfer of
materials (as in traditional ILL), document delivery via telefax, and networking
electronic information resources&quot; so that &quot;all schoolchildren, all
college students, all business people, all citizens should&#151;and will&#151;have
reliable, affordable, and equitable access to the full range of Texas'
information resources.&quot;  Specifically, TLA will recommend to the next
Legislature that it: 
</P>

<P>     Obviously, there's a big step between the TLA recommendations and the
actual funding.  And even with greater funding, cooperation among disparate
institutions is never easy.  But technology and public sentiment is pushing us
toward dramatically increased resource-sharing, and, fortunately, CTLS has a
long tradition of cooperation.  Our libraries should do quite well in the new
environment.

<P><B>OCLC NOTIFICATION LETTERS AND GREEN CARDS:  <BR>WHY THEY'RE SO
IMPORTANT 
</B><BR>Whenever the Austin Interlibrary Loan Center cannot supply an item from
the Austin Public Library Collection, we refer the request on to the OCLC
Interlibrary Loan system.  When we receive the indication online that one of the
libraries to which we have referred the request is shipping it to your library,
we print off a notification letter which indicates the author and title of the
requested item, the name of library that is sending the book or article to you,
and provides a section for you to write in the date the material is received and
later, the date that you return the material to the lending library.  Finally,
after the material is returned, we ask that you return the notification letter
with the &quot;Received&quot; and &quot;Returned&quot; dates noted to the Austin
ILC office. 
</P>
<P>It is important to us that you return the notification form to us for two
reasons:  we need to update the request online on OCLC to indicate that the item
has been returned, and we then forward the form to the Texas State Library.  TSL
uses the &quot;Received&quot; date information to calculate the Austin ILC's
turnaround time in providing materials to our member libraries.  This &quot;turnaround
time&quot; is a key factor in TSL's evaluation of our success as an ILL center. 
</P>
<P>For items supplied from the Austin Public Library's collection, a similar
effort is made to collect &quot;turnaround time&quot; statistics through the use
of  the &quot;Green Cards.&quot;  On dates randomly chosen by the State Library,
we enclose in all the books that we are shipping to member libraries a green
postcard which indicates the date of request and asks you to indicate the date
received and the name of your library.  As with the notification letters, it is
very important that we get these back with the requested information, so that
they can be forwarded to the Texas State Library.  Please be sure to fill in the
&quot;Received&quot; date and your library's name. 
</P>
<P>If you have questions about any of the forms that we send to you, please
feel free to contact me at the ILC office.

<P><B>BASTROP PUBLIC LIBRARY JOINS TEXAS GROUP
</B>
<BR>The Bastrop Public Library became the newest CTLS member library to join
the Texas Group.  As a member of the Texas Group, Bastrop is now able to refer
their requests directly online onto the OCLC Interlibrary Loan system to
libraries participating in the &quot;Group Access Capability&quot; system set up
in Texas and the surrounding states of Arkansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and
Arizona by the AMIGOS Bibliographic Council, our regional OCLC network. 
</P>
<P>Staff from Bastrop received their orientation and training at the AMIGOS
headquarters in Dallas in late August.  &quot;Before we went to training, we
were a little scared,&quot; said Barbara Harris, head librarian at Bastrop
Public Library, &quot;but we really enjoyed the training and enjoy using it. 
Now, Cookie and I fight over who's going to get to use OCLC!&quot;  Barbara
noted that CTLS's &quot;lateral ILL&quot; is still her preferred method of 
requesting materials, but about half of the requests now go directly to OCLC. 
She also noted that they have been able to find almost all they need when they
search OCLC for the materials. 
</P>
<P>Next month I will report on the Hillsboro City Library which is also a new
member of the Texas Group.

<P><B>J. FRANK DOBIE AWARD 
</B><BR>J. Frank Dobie Library Trust Awards are monetary awards given each
spring to library applicants selected by the Award Committee.    </P>
<P><B>Application Eligibility</B> Application is open to public libraries in
Texas which   serve a population of 20,000 or less,   are legally established,
and   are open for service at least 20 hours a week.   
</P>
<P><B>Number and Amount of Awards</B> The number and amount of awards depend
on net income produced by the Trust.  In 1996, each of four libraries received
an award of $6,841.   
</P>
<P><B>Expenditures of Awards</B> According to the terms of the Trust, funds
awarded may be used solely for the purchase of books.  Note: books which have
been reformatted for ease of use, i.e. books on audio tape or CD-ROM, are
eligible.   
</P>
<P><B>Award Criteria</B> In establishing the Trust, Mr. Dobie instructed the
Award Committee to take into consideration the degree of support that applicants
receive from their communities.   Therefore, awards are made not only on the
basis of need, but also on the extent to which community governments, library
boards, Friend's organizations, and individuals have promoted and supported the
library, in comparison with their potential to do so.  Applications should
include, but need not be limited to, the following information to help the
Committee determine the support of the library by the community, the support of
the community by the library, and the library's need of additional book
resources.  	</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>1.	A brief history of the library and description of its service area. 
<BR>2.	The library's itemized budget for the current year and itemized
expenditures for the two preceding years.
<BR>	3.	The amount of library income for the current year and two preceding
years by source.  As applicable, itemized income derived from city government,
county government, school district, state government, federal government, and
income derived from the private sector (gifts, fund raising events, etc.). 
<BR>4.	The number of full-time and part-time salaried staff by job title, and
the number of volunteer hours. 	<BR>5.	Hours of service. 	<BR>6.	The growth of
the book collection over the past three years, by volumes and titles.  Note:
please express in terms of net additions per year as opposed to cumulative
figures. 	<BR>7.	Circulation statistics for the past three years, in whatever
detail they have been kept. 	<BR>8.	Any support other than tax funds (which are
reported as income) provided by city, county, or school district, such as
library quarters. 	<BR>9.	Any engagement in library cooperation, such as
cooperation of the public and school libraries. 	<BR>10.	An account of local
efforts in support of the library, extending over one or more years.  Statistics
provide some evidence of continuing local support of the library, but limited
insight to the persistency and intensity of effort that went into their making. 
Tell how local government, businesses, and citizens groups have contributed to
the betterment of the library.  Tell of efforts the library staff, board, and
friends have made toward the promotion and improvement of library service. 
<BR>11.	The kinds of books the library proposes to buy and the reasons for such
purchases.  There are no restrictions on the kinds of books that may be bought;
however, regardless of type, books purchased should be of good quality and
lasting value. 	<BR>12.	The name and qualifications of the library staff member
who would be responsible for book selection, or the name and qualifications of a
consultant outside the library who would be willing to advise the library in its
book purchases.
